For over 35 years, biological scientists have come to rely on the research protocols and 
methodologies in the critically acclaimed Methods in Molecular Biology series. The series was 
the ﬁrst to introduce the step-by-step protocols approach that has become the standard in all 
biomedical protocol publishing. Each protocol is provided in readily-reproducible step-by-
step fashion, opening with an introductory overview, a list of the materials and reagents 
needed to complete the experiment, and followed by a detailed procedure that is supported 
with a helpful notes section offering tips and tricks of the trade as well as troubleshooting 
advice. These hallmark features were introduced by series editor Dr. John Walker and 
constitute the key ingredient in each and every volume of the Methods in Molecular Biology 
series. Tested and trusted, comprehensive and reliable, all protocols from the series are 
indexed in PubMed.

Preface 
Viruses are obligate intracellular parasites that rely on the host cellular machinery to replicate 
their genome, transcribe and translate viral genes, and package virions. In the case of plant 
viruses, they also need an active mechanism to move from the replication site to the 
plasmodesmata and infect neighboring uninfected cells. Additionally, viral molecular inter-
actions must successfully evade the host’s innate immune system. Any failure in these 
processes can jeopardize the virus’s ability to infect the host. Therefore, understanding the 
protein–protein interaction network between the virus and the host is crucial for compre-
hending the virus’s life cycle and developing strategies for broad-spectrum and long-lasting 
resistance against viral infections. 
This book has been organized to provide practical guidance starting from targeting 
speciﬁc molecular interactions within the virus–host interactome and progressing to the 
identiﬁcation of the complete virus–host protein–protein interaction network. The initial 
chapters primarily focus on acquiring the necessary molecular tools, including cloning and 
characterizing viral genomes, as well as techniques for inoculating DNA and RNA viruses. 
The book also covers biochemical and genetic approaches to conﬁrming protein–protein 
interactions both in vivo and in vitro. To analyze the functional aspects of these interactions, 
the book presents procedures and protocols for assessing replication, translation, viral 
genome movement, and insect transmission. Furthermore, the book explores cutting-
edge techniques for detecting multiple molecular interactions between the host and the 
virus, as well as monitoring immune hubs.

Chapter 1
Computational Pipeline for the Detection of Plant RNA
Viruses Using High-Throughput Sequencing
Livia Donaire and Miguel A. Aranda
Abstract
In this chapter, we describe a computational pipeline for the in silico detection of plant viruses by high-
throughput sequencing (HTS) from total RNA samples. The pipeline is designed for the analysis of short
reads generated using an Illumina platform and free-available software tools. First, we provide advice for
high-quality total RNA puriﬁcation, library preparation, and sequencing. The bioinformatics pipeline
begins with the raw reads obtained from the sequencing machine and performs some curation steps to
obtain long contigs. Contigs are blasted against a local database of reference nucleotide viral sequences to
identify the viruses in the samples. Then, the search is reﬁned by applying speciﬁc ﬁlters. We also provide the
code to re-map the short reads against the viruses found to get information on sequencing depth and read
coverage for each virus. No previous bioinformatics background is required, but basic knowledge of the
Unix command line and R language is recommended.

Introduction
High-throughput sequencing (HTS) is a powerful technique that,
together with a well-designed bioinformatics pipeline, can identify
both known and novel viruses infecting plants of virtually any
species [1]. According to the purpose of the HTS project, some
key aspects in the experimental design are critical and need to be
decided prior to selecting the bioinformatics pipeline to follow.
Broadly, these aspects include the selection of the nucleic acid
type (e.g., total RNA, double-stranded RNA, virion-associated
nucleic acids, and small RNAs) and isolation method, the sequenc-
ing platform (e.g., Illumina, Oxford Nanopore, and PacBio), and,
according to these, the library preparation method and the
sequencing strategy (e.g., length of reads, paired-end (PE) or
single-end (SE) reads, and sequencing depth) [2]. There are no
universal rules for correct bioinformatics analysis of HTS data for

virus identiﬁcation, nor even for any other application, but most of
the published pipelines share the same basic steps. These include
quality control (QC) of raw reads, which is essential to guarantee
the success of subsequent analyses and can be performed using
FastQC software [3]. Depending on the QC outcome, several
software tools can be used to trim reads based on quality scores or
remove adapter sequence contamination [4]. Either trimmed reads
or de novo assembled contigs can be used to search for viruses
against a database, being BLAST [5], one of the preferred algo-
rithms [2]. In most cases, the results must be ﬁltered and manually
analyzed. Numerous pipelines are available for plant virus detection
and discovery, with some able to detect new viruses, but most of
them require skills in command-line interfaces; some examples of
recently published pipelines are PVDP [6], VirHunter [7], and
Viroscope [8].

Livia Donaire and Miguel A. Aranda
Here, we described the bioinformatics pipeline we have suc-
cessfully used to identify viruses from total RNA samples in differ-
ent HTS projects [9, 10]. The pipeline is organized into four main
steps: (i) raw data analysis and ﬁltering; (ii) contig assembly and
identiﬁcation of plant viruses; (iii) calculation of sequencing depth
and read coverage along the viral genomes; and (iv) visualization of
alignments. The pipeline runs in Linux Operative System using
either the command line or an R script; therefore, basic knowledge
of the Linux command line and R language usage is highly
recommended.

2.2.3
Local Databases
1. Obtain plant virus sequences in FASTA format. Virus reference
genomes can be downloaded in FASTA format from the NCBI
virus portal https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/virus/vssi/
(Accessed Feb 2023). For this protocol, we created a plant
virus nucleotide database applying the following ﬁlters:
(i) sequence length: between 501 nts and 20,000 nts and
(ii) host: Spermatophyta (seed plants), taxid: 58024. Down-
load results in FASTA format (Nucleotide) with “Accession” as
the unique identiﬁer in the FASTA header (build custom
option) to avoid future problems with long identiﬁers. Rename
the ﬁle as “pvDB.fasta” and save it in a folder called “virusDB”
(108,885 sequences on 02 Feb 2023).
2. Get additional information on the virus sequences. Informa-
tion regarding the downloaded viral sequences can be obtained
from the NCBI virus portal, using the same ﬁlters applied to
obtain the sequences but selecting “Current table view result”
in CSV format. Displayed columns are optional, except “Acces-
sion”, which is mandatory. We usually select “Isolate”, “Spe-
cies”,
“Genus”,
“Family”,
“Molecule
type”,
“Length”,
“Segment”, “Country” and “Host”. Importantly, select “Acces-
sion with version (AY012345.1)” to match the accession in the
FASTA headers. Rename the ﬁle as “pvDB.csv” and save it in
the folder “virusDB”.
3. Build a blast database of the virus reference sequences to map
contigs against the viral genomes typing in the Linux command
line (see Note 3):
wd$ makeblastdb -in virusDB/pvDB.fasta -dbtype nucl -parse_-
seqids -out virusDB/pvDB
Options:
-in
Input file/database name
-dbtype
Molecule type of input (nucl or prot)
-parse_seqids
Parse bar delimited sequence identifier in
FASTA input
-out
Name of database to be created
The output is nine ﬁles with preﬁx “pvDB.*” saved in the
folder “virusDB”.
4. (Optional) Create a local plant host database for subtracting
plant reads. FASTA ﬁles for host plants are available for differ-
ent species in several plant genomic databases. Here, we used
the Tomato Heinz 1706 genome, release ITAG2.4 from Sol
Genomics Network. The genomic FASTA ﬁle “ITAG2.4_ge-
nomic.fasta” was saved in a folder called “plantDB”. To create
the Bowtie 2 index, type:

Bioinformatics Pipeline for HTS Plant Virus Detection
5
wd$
bowtie2-build
plantDB/ITAG2.4_genomic.fasta
plantDB/
ITAG2.4_genomic
The output is six ﬁles with the “*.bt2” extension saved in
the folder “plantDB”.
2.2.4
Input Data
1. Raw FASTQ ﬁles. Use raw FASTQ ﬁles obtained directly from
the sequencing company (see Note 4). To provide an example,
we have used here raw FASTQ ﬁles from two tomato sample
pools sequenced using Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform
(150 pb-PE reads) [10]. Files can be downloaded from the
Short Read Archive (SRA) under the accessions SRR14066947
and SRR14066948 using the SRA Toolkit (see Note 5). We will
refer to these two sets of data along the text as Tom2 and
Tom1, respectively.
2. Sample names ﬁle. More than one sample can be analyzed at
the same time using parallel processing. These simultaneous
analyses can be done using several software tools like GNU
parallel. To run GNU parallel, we recommend creating a ﬁle
containing the name of each sample in different lines (without
“_1” or “_2” in PE ﬁles or ﬁle extensions). In our example, we
created the ﬁle “sample.names.txt”, which looks like:
wd$ cat sample.names.txt
Tom1
Tom2
Here, the Linux command cat prints in the terminal the
content of the ﬁle “sample.names.txt” located within the wd.

Methods
3.1
Total RNA Library
Construction and
Sequencing
In this section, we offer some tips for optimizing sequencing per-
formance, but the reader needs to be aware that we are not
providing a comprehensive protocol.
1. High-quality total RNA puriﬁcation. Several methods are suit-
able for high-quality total RNA isolation, including commer-
cial kits. Based on our experience, we suggest using guanidine
isothiocyanate and acid-phenol-based methods such as TRI
reagent (MRC), followed by one or more phenol:chloroform
cleaning steps [10]. DNase treatment of the RNA samples is
essential; we use DNase I (AMPD1, Sigma-Aldrich) following
the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Total RNA QC. For QC of total RNA, we recommend mea-
suring the RNA Integrity Number (RIN) with a Bioanalyzer

6
Livia Donaire and Miguel A. Aranda
(we use the 2100 model from Agilent). Although a RIN value
higher than seven is typically recommended, we have found
that it may be difﬁcult to reach this value for some plant species.
According to our experience with melon and tomato samples,
lower RIN values may be acceptable if discrete ribosomal RNA
bands are visible in the gel-like image or after agarose gel
electrophoresis. We quantiﬁed the amount of RNA using a
NanoDrop
ND-1000
Spectrophotometer
(NanoDrop
Technologies).
For the subsequent steps of the protocol, we typically rely
on third-party companies to handle the library preparation,
including library QC, multiplexing, and Illumina sequencing.
Each sequencing company has speciﬁc RNA sample require-
ments in terms of concentration, purity, and volume.
3. cDNA library preparation and QC. For virus detection in total
RNA samples, we choose the TrueSeq Stranded Total RNA
with Ribo-Zero Plant Kit (Illumina), including the depletion of
plant ribosomal RNAs. We do not recommend protocols for
mRNA enrichment since many plant RNA viruses do not have a
poly(A) tail. For multiplex sequencing, individual barcodes
(or index adapters) are added to each DNA fragment during
the library preparation following speciﬁc recommendations and
kits provided by Illumina. To achieve high-quality sequencing
data, an accurate quantitation of the cDNA in the libraries is
required. This can be done by qPCR using the Illumina qPCR
Quantiﬁcation Protocol Guide (Illumina).
4. Illumina sequencing. For Illumina sequencing by synthesis
technology, the library of cDNA fragments is loaded onto a
ﬂow cell, where the fragments are clonally ampliﬁed by bridge
ampliﬁcation to generate clusters of identical fragments. These
clusters are the template for sequencing. Among the variety of
sequencing options, we usually select (i) multiplex sequencing
of maximum 50 cDNA libraries, (ii) 150 bp reads as minimum
sequencing length, (iii) PE reads, and (iv) sequencing depth
according to the number of multiplexed libraries. We found
that a minimum sequencing depth of 1.5 million reads per
sample for rRNA-depleted total RNA tomato samples was
needed to detect low-abundance viruses [10]. Then, the selec-
tion of the speciﬁc Illumina platform is normally based on a
combination of these requirements and the availability of the
sequencing company. In our case, we normally use the Nova-
Seq 6000 platform. In our example, we pooled three libraries in
a multiplex format and ordered 80 M of reads per sample,
150 bp-PE reads. In the following sections, we will describe
our analysis of two of these samples, consisting of two pools of
duplicated samples from the same 20 ﬁeld tomato plants
showing virus-like symptoms [10].

3.2
Raw Data
Analysis and Filtering
The ﬁrst steps of this pipeline are intended to analyze PE reads from
raw FASTQ ﬁles (see Notes 4 and 5). FastQC [3] identiﬁes poten-
tial issues, such as poor base quality or adapter contamination, and
these bases or reads are ﬁltered out in the next step using Trimmo-
matic [11]. If the plant host genome is available, we highly recom-
mend subtracting plant reads to enrich the datasets in viral reads.
1. QC of raw reads using FastQC [3]. FastQC involves a compre-
hensive set of QC metrics of raw sequencing reads, including
measures of sequence quality, GC content, read length distri-
bution, adapter contaminations, N content, and overrepre-
sented k-mers. To run FastQC using as input the FASTQ
ﬁles, type:
wd$ fastqc -t 4 Original_files/*.fastq.gz -o FastQC_raw
Options:
-t
Specifies the number of files (4) which can be processed
simultaneously
-o
Save all output files in a specific directory
Note that it is not necessary to decompress the FASTQ ﬁles
to run FastQC.
The output is a series of interactive HTML reports saved in
the folder “FastQC_raw” created previously in the wd. These
ﬁles include summary statistics and several graphical visualiza-
tions that help with the interpretation of this analysis. In our
example, we found that three QC metrics failed: per base
sequence content, sequence duplication levels, and adapter
content (Fig. 1a). Duplication of some sequences/reads is an
expected outcome in RNA-Seq data since over-representation
of some transcripts/viral sequences is expected in the samples.
The other two issues will be solved in the next step.
2. Cleaning of raw reads using Trimmomatic [11]. After the
FastQC analysis, we used Trimmomatic to remove the ﬁrst
13 bases at the 5′ end of the reads and to remove the adapter
contamination (see Note 6). Additionally, we applied other
ﬁlters to remove low-quality bases (below a threshold of 30)
and dropped reads shorter than 36 bases long. The code is as
follows (see Note 7):

orange signs passed the QC ﬁlters, while red signs indicate failure. After Trimmomatic, all metrics passed the
QC, except sequence duplication levels, which are expected to be high in RNA-Seq experiments

SLIDINGWINDOW
Cut when the average quality threshold of a
window of 4 bases is below 30
MINLEN
Drop the read shorter than 36 bases
Information about the Trimmomatic run is displayed in the
standard output (see Note 8). The complete path to the “adap-
ters” folder within the Trimmomatic directory should be added
in the ILLUMINACLIP option. Option settings need to be
adapted based on the dataset. The resulting FASTQ ﬁles are
saved in a folder called “trimming” (created previously) and are
referred to here as cleaned reads.
3. QC of cleaned reads using FastQC [3]. We rerun FastQC using
the ﬁltered reads to check Trimmomatic’s results by typing:
wd$ fastqc -t 8 Original_files/*.fastq.gz -o FastQC_clean
Options:
-t
Specifies the number of files (8) which can be processed
simultaneously
-o
Save all output files in a specific directory created
previously

Bioinformatics Pipeline for HTS Plant Virus Detection
9
As shown in Fig. 1b, the QC metrics that failed for raw
reads are acceptable after trimming.
4. (Optional) Filtering out plant reads using Bowtie 2 [12]. If the
plant host genome is available, it is recommended to remove
plant reads to enrich the datasets in virus reads and save compu-
tational time in the next steps. We kept reads that did not align
with the plant genome using the Bowtie 2 program with
default options:
plantDB$ cat ../sample.names.txt | parallel “bowtie2 --threads
8
-x
ITAG2.4_genomic
-1
../trimming/{}_1.PEtrim.fastq.gz
-2
../trimming/{}_2.PEtrim.fastq.gz
-U
../trimming/{}_1.UnPE-
trim.fastq.gz,../trimming/{}_2.UnPEtrim.fastq.gz
–un-gz
../
bowtie2_plant/{}_noPl.fastq.gz --un-conc-gz ../bowtie2_plant/
{}_noPlconc.fastq.gz -S ../{}_plant.sam“
--un
FASTQ
files containing unpaired reads that did
not align with the plant genome
--un-conc
FASTQ files containing paired reads that did not
align concordantly with the plant genome
Note that in this case, Bowtie 2 is executed within the
“plantDB” directory instead of in the main wd (see Note 3).
The double dot notation “../” is used to navigate one level up
in the directory tree. Information about the Bowtie 2 run is
displayed in the standard output, showing the number of
unmapped reads that likely corresponds to viral reads. The
resulting FASTQ ﬁles are saved in a folder called “bowtie2_-
plant” (created previously) and are referred to here as ﬁltered
reads. We obtained ﬁles of paired (“*.1_noPlconc.fastq.gz” or
“*.2_noPlconc.fastq.gz”)
and
single
(“*.noPl.fastq.gz”)
unmapped reads.
3.3
Contig Assembly
and Identiﬁcation of
Plant Viruses
The following steps are devoted to assembly short reads into long
contigs using Trinity [13] and to identifying known plant viruses by
BLAST [5] against the local virus database created previously (see
Subheading 2.2.3, item 3). After that, we applied a series of ﬁlters
to reﬁne the search with the purpose to identify viruses with high
conﬁdence. Although the BLAST search results are in tab-delimited
ﬁles that could be opened using a spreadsheet application like Excel,
we use R language to ﬁlter the results.
1. Contig assembly using Trinity [13]. A fundamental step in the
pipeline is the assembly of the short Illumina reads into long
contigs using Trinity de novo assembler program. Trinity can-
not work on paired and single reads at the same time, then we
ﬁrst join the ﬁles obtained in the previous step in a single ﬁle per
each sample using the Linux command zcat:

10
Livia Donaire and Miguel A. Aranda
wd$
cat
sample.names.txt
|
parallel
“zcat
bowtie2_plant/{}
_noPlconc.1.fastq.gz
bowtie2_plant/{}_noPlconc.2.fastq.gz
bowtie2_plant/{}_noPl.fastq.gz
>
bowtie2_plant/{}_allNoPl.
fastq”
The output ﬁles are not compressed since it is a prerequisite
for Trinity input ﬁles. Also, Trinity cannot run with GNU
parallel; then, we used the following bash loop to run the
program for the two samples successively:
bowtie2_plant$
for
FILE
in
*allNoPl.fastq;
do
Trinity
--
seqType fq --single "$FILE" --run_as_paired --CPU 12 --max_-
memory 50G --output ../Trinity/${trinity_FILE%%.}; done
Options:
--seqType
Type of reads
--single
Single reads
--run_as_paired
Single reads contains pairs
--CPU
Number of CPUs to use
--max_memory
Maximum memory to use
--output
Name of the directory for output (must
include ’trinity’ as a safety precaution)
The output ﬁles are saved in speciﬁc folders according to
the input ﬁles used; in our example, the folders are called
“trinity_Tom1allNoPl.fastq”
and
“trinity_Tom2allNoPl.
fastq.” Assembled contigs are saved in ﬁles with the sufﬁx
“*Trinity.fasta” within the main “Trinity” directory.
2. Mapping contigs against the local virus nucleotide database
using BLAST [5]. To identify plant viruses, we align the
FASTA ﬁles of assembled contigs against the nucleotide data-
base using BLASTn (BLAST for nucleotide sequences) as
follows:
wd$
cat
sample.names.txt |
parallel “blastn
-query Trinity/
trinity{}_allNoPl.fastq.Trinity.fasta
-db
virusDB/pvDB
-outfmt ‘6 qseqid qlen sseqid slen qstart qend length pident
evalue’
-num_threads
12
-max_target_seqs
1
-word_size
7
>
blastn/{}_VirNt.txt”
Options:
-outfmt
Alignment view option as tabular
-num_threads
Number of threads to use in the blast search
-max_target_seqs
Number of aligned sequences to keep (only 1)
-word_size
Length of the exact initial match
The mapping results are saved in tab-delimited format ﬁles
in the “blastn” folder (created previously) and contain the

following customized columns: “qseqid” (query seq-id), “qlen”
(query length), “sseqid” (subject seq-id or accession), “slen”
(subject length), “qstart” (start of alignment in query),
“qend” (end of alignment in query), “length” (alignment
length), “pident” (percentage of identical matches), and “eva-
lue” (expected value). We obtained 70,147 and 63,019 hits for
Tom1 and Tom2, respectively, being the next ﬁltering step a
crucial one to identify viruses with enough conﬁdence.
Bioinformatics Pipeline for HTS Plant Virus Detection
11
3. Filtering BLAST results using R. We applied the following
ﬁlters to the BLAST output tables: (i) contig length between
500 and 14,000 nts; (ii) length of alignment higher than
300 nts, and (iii) E-value lower than 1e10-5. For that, run
the following lines in the R console (see Notes 3 and 9):
# List the path of the BLASTn output files into R
>
myBlastList
=
list.files(path=“blastn”,
pattern=”*.txt”,
full.names=TRUE)
# Load the BLASTn output table of the first sample analyzed
(in alphabetical order) as a data frame in R
>
myBlastFile1
=
read.delim(myBlastList[1],
header=TRUE,
stringsAsFactors=FALSE,
col.names=c(“qseqid",
"qlen",
"sse-
qid", "slen", "qstart", "qend", "length", "pident", "evalue"))
# Save results of filtering BLASTn output in a new data frame
in R
>
myBlastFile1
=
subset(myBlastFile1,
myBlastFile1$qlen
>
500 & myBlastFile1$qlen < 14000 & myBlastFile1$length > 300 &
myBlastFile1$evalue < 0.00001)
# Export results of the first sample to a file to open in Excel
>
write.csv(myBlastFile1,
“blastn/Sample1_VirNt_filter.txt”,
row.names=FALSE)
#
Repeat
these
steps
but
change
all
occurrences
of
“1”
by
successive
numbers
according
to
the

samples
ana-
lyzed.
Alternatively, this code can be run in RStudio using the R
script “HTSVdetection.R” (see Note 9). The output are
tab-delimited ﬁles for each sample (saved in the “blastn” folder)
containing the same columns as the previous ﬁles but with
ﬁltered rows. The percentage of identity between the contig
and the reference virus could help to distinguish between
different strains or isolates of the same virus species or even
different virus species according to the species’ demarcation
criteria for a particular species. After ﬁltering, we obtained
77 and 80 hits for Tom1 and Tom2, respectively. Some acces-
sions may appear more than once if various contigs for the same
virus have been assembled. Then, the next steps of the pipeline
are devoted to reﬁning this search by calculating a series of
parameters on viral reads.

3.4
Re-map the
Reads against the
Reference Sequences
of the Identiﬁed
Viruses
We next performed a number of steps to reﬁne the actual virus
identiﬁcation by calculating (i) the number of mapping reads along
each viral reference genome, (ii) the average sequencing depth for
each viral reference genome, and (iii) the percentage of coverage
along each viral reference genome. We also provide the R code to
easily obtain summary information of the mapping reads and the
code to add additional information about the virus species found.
1. Get the reference sequences for the identiﬁed viruses using
SeqKit [14]. First, we need to copy the accession numbers of
the viral reference sequences in the column “sseqid” of the
ﬁltered BLASTn output ﬁles to a ﬁle called “myVirusIDs.txt.”
This ﬁle should contain only accession numbers of all samples
analyzed, in different lines, without any additional characters,
and without duplicate accession ids. Then, extract the
sequences from the “pvDB.fasta” ﬁle (see Subheading 2.2.3,
item 1) using SeqKit as follows:
wd$seqkit grep -f myVirusIDs.txt virusDB/pvDB.fasta > virusDB/
VirusFound.fasta
This creates a FASTA ﬁle containing only the sequences of
the virus identiﬁed by BLAST (43 sequences in this example).
Additionally, using a similar code, it is possible to extract the
sequences of the viral contigs from the Trinity contig FASTA
ﬁles for future analyses (the R code is available in the R script
“HTSVdetection.R” (see Note 10)).
2. Create an index to run BWA [15]. To run the BWA aligner, we
need ﬁrst to index the reference FASTA ﬁle as follows:
wd$ bwa index virusDB/VirusFound.fasta
This command creates ﬁve additional ﬁles with “Virus-
Found.fasta” as preﬁx and different ﬁle extensions in the folder
“virusDB” (created before).
3. Align ﬁltered reads against the reference viral sequences using
BWA. For this, we used the MEM algorithm as follows:
wd$
cat
sample.names.txt |
parallel “bwa
mem virusDB/Virus-
Found.fasta bowtie2_plant/{}_allNoPl.fastq > bwa/{}_bwaVirus-
Found.sam”
The output is alignment ﬁles per each sample in Sequence
Alignment Map (SAM) format saved in the folder “bwa” pre-
viously created. For the next steps, transform the output SAM
ﬁles into BAM and sort and index them using SAMtools [16]
using the following three command lines:

The output ﬁles with extensions “*.sort.bam” and “*.sort.
bam.bai” are saved in the “bwa” folder. SAM ﬁles could be
removed to save disk space.
4. Obtain summary information of mapped reads using the R
script “HTSVcalculation.R”. The ﬁrst part of this R script is
dedicated to counting reads using ﬁles obtained in different
steps of this pipeline (raw reads, cleaned reads, ﬁltered reads,
and virus reads) to get a table summarizing the analysis results.

14
Livia Donaire and Miguel A. Aranda
To run the script, we recommend the use of RStudio [17]. For
these calculations, run the part of the script entitled “Counting
reads”
(see
Note
10).
The
results
are
exported
to
a
tab-delimited ﬁle (“*.csv” extension) that can be opened
using Excel or any spreadsheet application and are shown in
Table 1. Alternatively, the code is also written in the full pipe-
line R script “HTSVdetection.R” (see Note 10).
5. Calculate average sequencing depth and percentage of cover-
age using the R script “HTSVcalculation.R”. The second part
of this R script is devoted to calculating sequencing depth using
SAMtools and, from this, calculating the percentage of cover-
age along the viral genomes using R commands. This script also
provides the code to add information about the virus species
found (see Subheading 2.2.3, item 2). For that, run the second
part of the script entitled “Calculating basic parameters on viral
reads and adding virus information” (see Note 10). The results
are exported to one tab-delimited ﬁle (“*.csv” extension) per
sample and can be opened using Excel or any spreadsheet
application (Table 2). Alternatively, the code is also written in
the full pipeline R script “HTSVdetection.R” (see Note 10).
3.5
Visualize
Mapping Reads Along
the Viral Genomes
Here, we offer two alternatives to visualize viral reads along viral
genomes. One uses Tablet [18], a speciﬁc tool for graphical visuali-
zation of HTS data, including assemblies or read mappings. The
other option is a code to graphically represent mapping reads along
the viral genomes using the ggplot2 R package.
1. Visualize mapping reads against viral genomes using Tablet
[18]. In the main Tablet windows, click on “Open Assembly”
and browse the BAM ﬁles in the “bwa” folder to open mapping
reads ﬁles; as reference sequences, load the FASTA ﬁle “Viru-
sesFound.fasta” created previously (located in “bwa” folder).
The number of mapping reads across each viral reference
sequence is displayed in the left panel, while the alignments
can be visualized in the right panel (Fig. 2). Alignments can be
displayed in different modes from the “Advanced tab”: With
the “Coverage” mode, it is possible to visualize the read cover-
age across the reference sequences; with the “Scaled” mode, it
is possible to visualize individual reads and their alignments to
the reference sequences. Customizing the display settings in
“Home” and “Color Scheme” tabs is possible.
2. Create plots of read coverage along viral genomes. We also
provide the R code to create plots of read coverage along the
identiﬁed viral genomes using ggplot2 R package. In the third
part of the R script “HTSVcalculation.R” with the title: “Cre-
ate plots of read coverage,” there is the code to do
so. Alternatively, the code is also written in the full pipeline R
script “HTSVdetection.R” (see Note 10).

Bioinformatics Pipeline for HTS Plant Virus Detection

Fig. 2 Visualization of viral reads along the viral genomes using Tablet. Only one alignment can be visualized at
a time. For example, here we show the alignment of reads along the pepino mosaic virus genome (Accession
MK133092.1) in the Tom1 sample. The upper panel on the right shows the read coverage along the viral
genome, which is 100%. The panel on the left shows the number of mapped reads per reference genome and
the length of the genomes
Coverage plots for Tom1 are shown in Fig. 3, where one can
easily notice that the coverage of reads along particular virus gen-
omes is insufﬁcient to be conﬁdent on the presence of that virus in
the analyzed sample (e.g., for soybean ilarvirus 1); therefore, man-
ual inspection and results curation are needed (Table 2).

Notes
1. The pipeline works on Linux Operative Systems with any
Ubuntu
distribution
installed.
We
used
an
Intel
Core
i7–8700 CPU processor computer with 64 GB of RAM mem-
ory and Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS.
2. Installing programs in Ubuntu is generally straightforward and
can be done from the command line using the package man-
agement system Advanced Packing Tool (APT) or download-
ing from the Web and installing speciﬁc packages (generally
with “.deb” extension) using the dpkg command. When possi-
ble, we recommend installing compiled binary programs
instead of source code and installing the programs in PATH
(list of directories where Ubuntu search for executable ﬁles),
otherwise you would need to specify the full path to the exe-
cutable ﬁles.

3. The pipeline was developed to use text-based commands exe-
cuted in the Linux command line (also referred to here as
console or terminal). Optionally, the pipeline can be run
using an R script. Then, basic knowledge of Linux command
line and R language usage is required. To get basic skills in
both, we recommend the HBC Training Program https://
hbctraining.github.io/main/ Accessed Feb 2023).

Bioinformatics Pipeline for HTS Plant Virus Detection
17
Speciﬁc nomenclature used in this protocol is as follows:
– The symbol “$” is used to indicate that a command should
be typed in the Linux terminal.
– “wd” is used here to refer to the current working directory,
which is the complete path in your computer to the direc-
tory where input and output ﬁles are located and from
which you should run the programs in the console (unless
another path is speciﬁed). In our case, the wd in the Linux
console looks like this:
bioinformatics@bioinformatics-cpu:/mnt/Linux_data/MiMB_proto-
col$
On the left of the colon, there are speciﬁed user and
name of the computer we are using and, on the right, the
full path to the wd where we are running the pipeline. From
now on, we will use only “wd$.”
– The symbol “>” is used to indicate an R command that can
be executed in the R console. To start R, just type “R” in the
Linux console and press enter. Alternatively, this pipeline
can be run using a user-friendly interface for R; we recom-
mend RStudio, and the provided R script “HTSVdetection.
R.”
4. FASTQ ﬁles contain the sequence data from the base call of
individual clusters generated using the Illumina technology
that passes the ﬁlter criteria. In the case of multiplexed samples,
a demultiplexing step is performed ﬁrst. This process assigns
clusters to speciﬁc samples based on the index sequences added
to each library. For PE runs, two FASTQ ﬁles (R1 and R2) are
generated for each sample.
5. To download data from SRA in FASTQ, use the SRA Toolkit
following the instructions at the GitHub NCBI site (github.
com/ncbi/sra-tools/wiki/02.-installing-SRA-Toolkit). Once
installed and conﬁgured, use the tool fasterq-dump as follows:
wd$ fasterq-dump SRR14066947 SRR14066948 --outdir Original_-
files
The ﬁles are saved in a folder created previously called
“Original_ﬁles” in the wd and are renamed to “Tom1_1.fastq”
and “Tom1_2.fastq” (SRR14066948) or “Tom2_1.fastq” and
“Tom2_2.fastq”
(SRR14066947).
Usually,
FASTQ
ﬁles
obtained from the sequencing company are compressed (“*.
fastq.gz”); to compress FASTQ ﬁles obtained from SRA, use
the gzip program:
wd$ gzip -r Original_files

18
Livia Donaire and Miguel A. Aranda
6. Illumina adapter sequence ﬁles are included with Trimmomatic
distribution located in a folder called “adapters” within the
Trimmomatic main directory. “TruSeq3-PE-2.fa” ﬁle contains
adapter sequences used for PE reads obtained using different
Illumina machines (like MiSeq or HiSeq). However, according
to Trimmomatic’s instructions, these sequences have not
undergone extensive testing, and it is possible that other
sequences may perform better for a given dataset. Then, Trim-
momatic accepts a custom version of that FASTA ﬁle.
7. We used GNU parallel to run processes for Tom1 and Tom2 in
parallel. The Linux command cat prints each line of the ﬁle
“sample.names.txt” (see Subheading 2.2.4, item 2) that is sub-
sequently piped to the replacement string of GNU parallel
(appended by the symbol “{}”) and used as input by different
programs like Trimmomatic, Bowtie 2, etc.
8. In Unix, standard output (stdout) is the standardized data ﬂow
generated by command line programs, displayed by default on
the terminal. The standard output provides information about
the status of the running program or the result of a speciﬁc
command line program. Redirecting the standard output to a
ﬁle by including the option “> ﬁle_name” is possible.
9. In R and many programming languages, a line of code starting
with the “#” symbol is considered a comment for human read-
ers to explain the preceding or the following code and it is not
executed.
10. To run an R code using RStudio, follow these steps:
– In RStudio, click on File> New File > R Script or click on
File> Open File to open an R script previously created.
– Write or paste the R code to the new script window and save
the R script on File> Save.
– To run the R code, you can use different ways: (i) Click on
“Run” at the top-right corner of the script window (will run
the full script); (ii) use the keyboard shortcut “Ctrl+Enter”
to run the current line of code; (iii) highlight a section of
code and click on “Run”; or (iv) click on “Source” in the
top-right corner of the script window (will run the full
script). We recommend running the code line by line to
avoid any bugs and to check that the variables are correctly
created before continuing with the following line code. To
visualize a variable in RStudio, simply type the variable name
in the console and press enter or use the command “print
(variable).”
– The output of the R code will appear in the Console panel at
the bottom of the RStudio window, viewed in the Plots
panel, the Environment panel, or will be an exported ﬁle
depending on the output command used.

The R script “HTSVdetection.R” performs the complete pipe-
line in R language by taking advantage of the “system()” R function
that allows to execute a Linux command within the R code. The R
script “HTSVcalculation.R” performs only some calculations from
the following steps of the pipeline: in Subheading 3.4, step 4:
Obtain summary information of mapped reads; step 5: Calculate
average sequencing depth and percentage of coverage, where also
there is the code to add virus information to the results and in
Subheading 3.5; and step 2: Create plots of read coverage along the
viral genomes.

Chapter 2 
Taxonomic Classiﬁcation of Geminiviruses Based 
on Pairwise Sequence Comparisons 
Joa˜o Paulo Herrera da Silva and F. Murilo Zerbini 
Abstract 
Geminiviridae is the largest and one of the most diverse families of plant viruses, comprising 14 genera 
demarcated based on host range, type of insect vector, and phylogenetic relationships. The use of unbiased, 
whole-genome multiple displacement ampliﬁcation techniques coupled with high-throughput sequencing 
has greatly expanded our knowledge of geminivirus diversity over the last two decades. As a result, a large 
number of new species have been described in recent years. Species demarcation criteria in the family are 
entirely based on sequence comparisons, but the speciﬁc cutoff values vary for each genus. The purpose of 
this chapter is to provide a step-by-step pipeline to classify new species in the family Geminiviridae.

Introduction 
Virus taxonomy (the hierarchical classiﬁcation and naming of virus 
taxa) is coordinated by the International Committee on Taxonomy 
of Viruses (ICTV). The ICTV is organized into seven Subcommit-
tees, including the Plant Virus Subcommittee, and more than 
120 Study Groups (SGs), including 22 plant virus SGs. Most SGs 
are organized at the family rank, such as the Geminiviridae and 
Tolecusatellitidae SG [1]. Thus, virus classiﬁcation at the genus and 
species levels is usually established by SGs, which have considerable 
autonomy in establishing genus and species demarcation criteria 
within their respective families. For geminiviruses, the criteria for 
genera demarcation include host range (monocots or dicots), type 
of insect vector (leafhoppers, treehoppers, whiteﬂies, and aphids), 
genome organization, and phylogenetic relationships [2]. The 
Geminiviridae SG pioneered the demarcation of species based 
solely on sequence comparisons, establishing detailed guidelines 
on how pairwise identities must be calculated and determining

the cutoff values for each genus [3–7]. Although not without 
criticism at its establishment [8], these demarcation criteria have 
stood the test of time and have been adopted by several other SGs 
[9, 10]. One aspect of this classiﬁcation system is that it can be easily 
implemented in semi-automated (or even fully automated) forms. 
Here, we provide a pipeline, based on current species demarcation 
criteria, to classify species in the different genera of the Geminivir-
idae. It is worth remembering that taxonomy is a dynamic ﬁeld, and 
the species demarcation criteria may change over time.

1.1 
The 
Geminiviridae 
The Geminiviridae family comprises viruses that infect plants and 
have a small genome composed of one or two circular, single-
stranded DNA (ssDNA) molecules ranging from 2.5 to 5.2 kb in 
length [2, 7]. The family belongs to the order Geplafuvirales, class 
Repensiviricetes, phylum Cressdnaviricota, kingdom Shotokuvirae, 
and realm Monodnaviria [11]. Geminiviruses have unique, quasi-
icosahedral twinned particles made up of 110 subunits of a single 
coat protein organized into 22 pentameric capsomeres [12–15]. 
The Geminiviridae family is the largest and one of the most 
diverse among all viruses. Its 14 genera (Becurtovirus, Begomovirus, 
Capulavirus, Citlodavirus, Curtovirus, Eragrovirus, Grablovirus, 
Maldovirus, Mastrevirus, Mulcrilevirus, Opunvirus, Topocuvirus, 
Turncurtovirus, and Topilevirus) are deﬁned based on host range, 
type of insect vector, genome organization, and phylogenetic rela-
tionships [2]. The family contains 520 species as of May 2023 (ictv. 
global/taxonomy). The genus Begomovirus, with 445 species, is the 
largest in the entire virosphere. On the other extreme, there are six 
orphan geminivirus species, that is, which are not afﬁliated to a 
genus: Common bean curly stunt virus, Limeum africanum-
associated virus, Parsley yellow leaf curl virus, Polygala garcinii-
associated virus, Opuntia virus 2, and Olea europaea geminivirus 
[16–20]. The enormous diversity of geminiviruses results from 
high mutation rates and frequent recombination [21–28]. 
Geminiviruses have quite similar genomic organization in size 
and number of components. The exceptions are the bipartite repre-
sentatives of the genus Begomovirus and Olea europaea geminivirus, 
which 
have 
two 
genomic 
components 
packaged 
separately 
[2, 20]. All geminivirus genomes have a long intergenic region 
(LIR) with a conserved stem-loop structure where the origin of 
replication is located. In the case of bipartite begomoviruses, there 
is a region of approximately 200 nucleotides in the LIR that is 
almost identical between cognate DNA-A and DNA-B compo-
nents, known as the common region [2, 29]. Geminivirus genomes 
contain genes in both the viral and the complementary senses 
[30]. Gene composition varies slightly among the 14 genera. In 
general, geminiviruses encode at least six proteins, two or three in 
the viral sense (CP, V1/AV1, and V2/AV2) and three or four in the 
complementary 
sense 
(Rep, 
Trap, 
Ren, 
and 
C4/AC4).

Begomoviruses have intra-genus differences, such as the lack of 
AV2 in New World begomoviruses, the presence of C5/AC5 in 
some viruses, and the two genes (MP and NSP) encoded in the 
DNA-B component of bipartite begomoviruses [4]. Eragroviruses 
are the simplest geminiviruses regarding genomic organization, 
with only four genes (CP and MP in the viral sense and Rep and 
Trap in the complementary sense) [6]. Becurtoviruses, capula-
viruses, 
citlodaviruses, 
grabloviruses, 
mastreviruses, 
mulcrile-
viruses, and topileviruses express Rep (C1) and Rep-A (C1:C2) 
from spliced transcripts [2, 31].

1.2 
Species 
Demarcation Criteria 
The main species demarcation criterion adopted for geminiviruses 
is based on pairwise comparisons of 
full-length nucleotide 
sequences. The cutoff values for species demarcation are deter-
mined from the distribution of pairwise identity percentages. This 
sequence-based classiﬁcation is easy to implement and has proven 
to be robust so far. When available, information on the biological 
properties of a given geminivirus may help delimit species, espe-
cially in those cases where the percent identity between sequences is 
very close to the threshold [2, 4, 32]. 
The species demarcation cutoff is 77% for curtoviruses, 78% for 
capulaviruses, citlodaviruses, maldoviruses, mastreviruses, mulcri-
leviruses, opunviruses, and topileviruses, 80% for becurtoviruses, 
grabloviruses and turncurtoviruses, and 91% for begomoviruses 
[3–5, 7, 33]. There are no species demarcation criteria for Eragro-
virus and Topocuvirus, since both genera contain a single species 
[2, 6]. 
1.3 
Step-by-Step 
Procedure for the 
Classiﬁcation of 
Species in the Family 
Geminiviridae 
This chapter aims to provide a step-by-step guide to determining 
the taxonomic placement of geminiviruses based on their complete 
nucleotide sequences (Fig. 1). It is not the scope of this text to 
provide a detailed discussion on analysis assumptions, parameter 
conﬁguration, or the accuracy of one method or another. It will be 
up to the user to decide on the software of their preference. 
2 
Materials 
1. Datasets in fasta format. The datasets should be composed of 
the most closely related sequences (based on a Blastn search) to 
the sequence you want to classify. 
2. Sequence Demarcation Tool Version 1.2 (SDT v1.2) software 
[34]. SDT v1.2 is available as a free download at http://web. 
cbio.uct.ac.za/SDT (see Note 1). This software was speciﬁcally 
developed to classify sequences based on identity values from 
pairwise alignments (as opposed to multiple sequence align-
ments). Furthermore, percent identities are calculated with

24
Joa˜ o Paulo Herrera da Silva and F. Murilo Zerbini
Fig. 1 Workﬂow for taxonomic classiﬁcation of geminiviruses based on pairwise sequence comparisons. The 
dataset in FASTA format is comprised of the complete genomic sequence of the virus to be classiﬁed (Query) 
and sequences of related viruses, as determined in a BLASTn search. From the FASTA ﬁle, pairwise sequence 
comparisons are performed with Sequence Demarcation Tool (SDT). Species assignment is based on the 
percent identities between the Query sequence and the other sequences in the dataset. Phylogenetic analysis 
can be performed to corroborate the results of pairwise sequence comparisons. For this, a multiple sequence 
alignment is obtained with the appropriate program (such as MAFFT). Then, the best nucleotide substitution 
model is chosen with ModelTest-NG, and a phylogenetic tree based on the maximum-likelihood method is 
obtained with RaxML-NG. A distinct species will form a well-supported monophyletic clade with a consider-
able phylogenetic distance from other species 
pairwise deletion of gaps (in other words, sites with gap char-
acters are excluded from the pairwise identity calculations). 
The software is available for 32- and 64-bit Windows, Linux, 
and macOS operating systems (see Note 2). 
3. Multiple DNA sequence aligner software. There are numerous 
computer programs developed to perform this task, such as 
MUSCLE, MAFFT, T-Coffee, and Clustal. They are available 
for different operating systems and implemented on different 
platforms, and many have online versions (e.g., at the CIPRES 
portal: https://www.phylo.org/). We will use MAFFT 7 as an 
example, but the user should feel free to choose the most

Geminivirus Classiﬁcation
25
familiar software for them (see Note 3). MAFFT 7 versions for 
Linux, macOS, and Windows can be downloaded from 
https://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/software/. The program’s 
manual 
is 
available 
at 
the 
link 
mentioned 
above 
and 
(as always) is recommended reading. 
4. Software to test the nucleotide substitution model that best ﬁts 
the data set. We will use ModelTest-NG, but the user should 
feel free to choose the software of their choice. ModelTest-NG 
versions for Linux, macOS, and Windows can be downloaded 
from https://github.com/ddarriba/modeltest. The software 
is also available on the CIPRES portal (https://www.phylo. 
org/). See Note 3. 
5. Software for running phylogenetic analysis. As with sequence 
alignment tools, there are many software packages for phyloge-
netic analysis based on different methods (neighbor-joining, 
maximum parsimony, maximum-likelihood, Bayesian infer-
ence, among others). We will provide simple, step-by-step 
instructions to run a maximum-likelihood phylogenetic analy-
sis in RaxML-NG. RaxML-NG is available as 64-bit Linux and 
64-bit macOS versions at https://github.com/amkozlov/ 
raxml-ng (see Note 4). The analysis can also be performed in 
the CIPRES portal (https://www.phylo.org/). 
3 
Methods 
3.1 
Building the 
Dataset 
1. Submit the sequence(s) you wish to classify to a BLASTn search 
of the “non-redundant nucleotide” database. This analysis can 
be performed on the Web at https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ 
Blast.cgi?PROGRAM=blastn&PAGE_TYPE=BlastSearch& 
LINK_LOC=blasthome. BLASTn will perform an alignment 
between the submitted sequence (Query) and the sequences 
from the National Center for Biotechnology Information 
(NCBI) database (Subject) and will return the result of the 
comparisons between the sequences and the respective statisti-
cal analysis (percent coverage, percent identity, E-value, and 
score). 
2. The dataset should be composed of the sequences constituting 
the top n hits from the BLASTn search. n can vary from as few 
as 20 to as many as 100 sequences, depending on how similar 
these sequences are (see Note 5). The dataset must be saved in a 
ﬁle in FASTA format. It is imperative that the genomes are 
complete and that the added sequences are linearized in the 
conventional orientation; that is, all of them must start at the 
ﬁrst nucleotide after the Rep cleavage site. This nucleotide 
(an adenine) is located within the nonanucleotide at the origin 
of replication (5′-TAATATT//AC-3′)  (see Note 6).

3.2 
Performing 
Pairwise Sequence 
Comparisons with SDT 
v1.2 
1. Start SDT v1.2, go to the “Open” menu, and choose the 
dataset in FASTA format to be analyzed. The dataset can be 
loaded aligned or unaligned (see Note 7). 
2. Once the dataset is loaded, the program will open a window 
with available analysis options. Choose the MAFFT alignment 
option and click on “Run.” SDT v1.2 will perform the align-
ment of every unique pair of sequences, and then, the percent 
identity will be calculated from the alignment (see Note 8). 
3. At the end of the analysis, STD v1.2 will generate a colored 
graphic matrix with pairwise identity values. The matrix can be 
saved as an image in .EMF (vector graphics) or .BMP (bitmap 
graphics) formats. There is also the option to save the identity 
values as .txt or .csv ﬁles. Another visualization option is to plot 
the distribution of percent identities on a graph. 
3.3 
Classiﬁcation 
Based on Pairwise 
Nucleotide Sequence 
Identities 
1. If the Query sequence has a pairwise identity value above the 
species demarcation threshold with a sequence from the dataset 
(corresponding to “virus X”), then the virus from which the 
Query sequence is derived is a member of the same species as 
virus X. On the other hand, if the Query sequence has percent 
identities below the species demarcation threshold with all 
other sequences in the dataset, then the corresponding virus 
should be considered a member of a new species. See Note 9. 
3.4 
Phylogenetic 
Analysis: Obtaining a 
Multiple Sequence 
Alignment 
1. Execute MAFFT7 in the terminal or command prompt. There 
is also the option to carry out the analysis online at https:// 
www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/mafft/ (see Note 3). From the 
terminal or command prompt, type: % mafft [arguments] 
input_ﬁle_name > output_ﬁle_name (see Note 10). 
2. The input ﬁle must be in FASTA format. MAFFT automatically 
recognizes the type of dataset (nucleotide or amino acid 
sequences). 
3. The user can choose the alignment method that is most suit-
able for the speciﬁc situation they are working on. MAFFT has 
different alignment methods designed to solve different pro-
blems, such as datasets of different sizes and complexities. 
These are explained in detail in the program manual. If, even 
after checking the manual, the user is unsure which method to 
use, choose: % mafft --auto input_ﬁle_name > output_ﬁle_-
name (see Note 11). 
4. The output can be viewed using a sequence preview tool or as a 
text ﬁle. Detailed visualization of the result is crucial to evaluate 
the quality of the alignment. A poor alignment will result in a 
phylogeny with low credibility. See Note 12.

Phylogenetic 
Analysis: Running 
ModelTest-NG 
1. Open ModelTest-NG in the terminal or command prompt. 
Run the following command: % modeltest-ng --input align-
ment_ﬁle_name --output output_ﬁle_name --processes 24 --
datatype nt --schemes 11. See Note 13. 
2. At the end of the analysis, ModelTest-NG will generate a table 
with details of the analysis. In the table, you will ﬁnd various 
model selection criteria, such as Akaike (AIC), corrected Akaike 
(AICc), and Bayesian (BIC) criteria for each model. At the end 
of the page, you will see a summary with the models that best ﬁt 
the data based on each criterion mentioned above. See Note 
14. 
3.6 
Phylogenetic 
Analysis: Performing 
Maximum-Likelihood 
Analysis in RaxML-NG 
1. Run raxml-ng in the terminal or command prompt: % raxml-ng
--bootstrap --msa alignment_ﬁle_name --model GTR+G --
seed 2 --threads 2 --bootstrap 1000 --bs-trees 100 --preﬁx 
output_ﬁle_name. See Note 15. 
2. At the end of the analysis, the program will generate several 
ﬁles, among them a .tree ﬁle containing the best phylogenetic 
tree with the bootstrap supports values of the branches. The 
result of this analysis can be viewed using tools for viewing and 
editing phylogenetic trees, such as FigTree (http://tree.bio.ed. 
ac.uk/software/ﬁgtree/) or iTOL (https://itol.embl.de/). See 
Notes 16 and 17.

Notes 
1. For details on installation and usage, consult the SDT v1.2 
manual, available at the same download link. As a general 
rule, reading every program’s manual is essential to choose 
the correct parameters and to be able to analyze the results 
critically. 
2. The macOS version of SDT is a command line-based applica-
tion written in Python 2 (which is no longer supported). It may 
be difﬁcult to install and run successfully on ARM-based com-
puters running macOS 11 or later due to multiple dependency 
issues. Until an updated version is released, we do not recom-
mend using it. 
3. Programs that are command line-based can be intimidating to 
users who do not have at least a basic knowledge of bioinfor-
matics. These users may opt for online versions whenever they 
are available, as these versions are generally much easier to use. 
Nevertheless, we encourage users to use the command line 
versions, as they tend to be more powerful in many instances. 
For absolute beginners, the methods in this chapter provide the 
exact commands that need to be typed for each analysis (feel 
free to copy/paste them). As the user becomes more

28
Joa˜ o Paulo Herrera da Silva and F. Murilo Zerbini
comfortable with the command line, they will notice that the 
command line greatly facilitates repetitive tasks and gives the 
user much more control over the program. 
4. There are separate macOS versions for Intel-based and 
ARM-based computers. In Windows computers, it is necessary 
to run the Linux binary via Windows Subsystem for Linux. 
5. For example, if the 25th hit has high (>90%) coverage but low 
(<75%) identity with the query, using the top 25 hits will be 
satisfactory. However, if the 25th hit still has high coverage and 
very high identity with the query, sequences further down the 
list should be included in the dataset until a sequence with high 
coverage/low identity is included. 
6. Sequences that have been submitted to GenBank after 2005 
tend 
to 
begin 
at 
this 
nucleotide. 
Unfortunately, 
older 
sequences often do not. If the dataset contains a small number 
of those sequences, it is easy to adjust them manually. However, 
for a large number of sequences, it will be helpful to write a 
simple script to automate the process. 
7. Since SDT performs the alignment itself, it is actually better to 
load the dataset unaligned. 
8. The percent identity is given by the function 1-(M/N), where 
M is the number of mismatching nucleotides and N is the total 
number of sites of the alignment. The calculation is based on 
true alignments, that is, disregarding the gaps. 
9. Some begomovirus species have a very large number of 
sequence isolates, and in these cases, it is not uncommon that 
the query sequence will have a percent identity above the 
species demarcation threshold with some isolates and below 
the threshold with other isolates. The Geminiviridae Study 
Group of the ICTV has provided a set of helpful “conﬂict 
resolution criteria” that address this and other issues. These 
are available in ref. [4]. Speciﬁcally for the case mentioned 
above, the conﬂict resolution criterion states that “The new 
isolate should be classiﬁed as belonging to the species with 
which it shares >91 % nt sequence identity with any one isolate 
from that species, even if it is <91 % identical to all other 
isolates from that species.” 
10. In this and in every subsequent command line input, the text in 
italics should be replaced with the user-given names. For 
example, if the user named the ﬁle that contains their dataset 
as New_begomovirus.fasta and would like the output ﬁle to be 
named New_begomo_alignment.txt, then the input text 
should be % mafft [arguments] New_begomovirus.fasta > 
New_begomo_alignment.txt. 
11. These are the basic options for carrying out the analysis. Addi-
tional parameters can be conﬁgured to increase the alignment 
accuracy, such as gap opening penalty score and gap extension

Geminivirus Classiﬁcation
29
penalty score: % mafft --auto --op <value> --ep <value> 
input_ﬁle_name > output_ﬁle_name. The default values for 
gap opening and gap extension penalty scores are 1.53 and 
0.123, respectively. For more details, the user should check the 
program’s manual. 
12. The need to inspect the alignment cannot be overstated. With 
some experience, the user will be able to adjust the alignment 
manually, improving its accuracy. But with that said, the user 
should only do this if they are sure of what they are doing. 
Otherwise, manual adjustment can have the opposite effect, 
generating artifacts and reducing the reliability of subsequent 
analyses. Note that all the following analyses will be performed 
from the alignment, and poor alignments will increase the 
uncertainty of the inferences. 
13. Meaning of the parameters:
--input: This is the MAFFT output ﬁle (i.e., the alignment ﬁle). 
You must input the dataset duly prepared, as described 
above, aligned in PHYLIP or FASTA format.
--processes: Indicates the number of concurrent threads.
--datatype: Indicates whether the dataset is comprised of nucle-
otide (nt) or amino acid (aa) sequences.
--schemes: Indicates the number of predeﬁned DNA substitu-
tion schemes to be evaluated. 
14. For more details on parameter settings and analysis of results, 
we highly recommend reading the manual, available in the 
Releases section of the program’s website (https://github. 
com/ddarriba/modeltest/releases), and/or checking the Wiki 
section (https://github.com/ddarriba/modeltest/wiki). 
15. Meaning of the parameters:
--msa: Indicates the input, which is the MAFFT output ﬁle 
(i.e., the alignment ﬁle); in this example, the alignment is in 
FASTA format, but RaxML-NG recognizes FASTA, PHY-
LIP, and CATG ﬁle formats.
--model: Indicates the evolutionary model determined based 
on ModelTest-NG, as described in the previous section.
--seed: Speciﬁes a random number seed for the parsimony 
inferences; this allows the user to reproduce their results.
--threads: Speciﬁes the number of CPU cores.
--bootstrap: Indicates the number of bootstrap replicates 
to run.
--bs-trees: Sets the number of trees to be saved for each boot-
strap replicate.
--preﬁx: Speciﬁes the preﬁx to be used for the output ﬁles 
generated by RaxML; this parameter is important to 
avoid overwriting previously generated output ﬁles.

clade with a considerable phylogenetic distance from other 
species and will corroborate the result from the SDT analysis.

Initiation of Plant Virus Infections by Agroinﬁltration 
of Infectious Viral cDNAs (icDNAs) 
Maija Pollari 
Abstract 
Agroinﬁltration uses Agrobacterium to deliver T-DNA-based gene expression constructs into plants. This 
chapter focuses on the standard method, speciﬁcally from the perspective of plant virus research, and 
describes a protocol for the initiation of virus infections in plants via inﬁltration of Agrobacterium strains 
carrying infectious viral cDNAs (icDNAs). The method outlines the culture and preparation of Agrobacter-
ium for inﬁltration, the inﬁltration procedure, optimization of the optical density of the Agrobacterium 
suspension, and sampling of infected plants post-agroinﬁltration. The advantages of the agroinﬁltration 
method compared to traditional mechanical inoculation using sap from infected plants are discussed. The 
protocol is applicable for different pathosystems, although case-speciﬁc optimization of inﬁltration para-
meters and sampling is recommended.

Introduction 
The genus Agrobacterium encompasses a widespread group of 
gram-negative bacteria best known for their ability to transfer part 
of their DNA into plant hosts. This characteristic has been explored 
and utilized by researchers since the 1980s, and it has ﬁrmly estab-
lished the genus as the workhorse of the genetic transformation of 
plants. 
Agrobacterium tumefaciens (hereafter A. tumefaciens), initially 
described as a bacterium inducing crown gall tumors in daisies, is 
the type species of the genus Agrobacterium [1–3]. The genus 
currently encompasses 16 species [4, 5], many of which are soil-
borne or root-associated phytopathogens. Additionally, the diverse 
genus also includes non-pathogenic species from a variety of habi-
tats and different lifestyles. Indeed, before the availability of molec-
ular 
techniques 
and 
genome 
sequencing,

organization of the clade was often disputed, which led to the 
transfer of species into the genus Rhizobium and vice versa [4]. A 
curious example illustrating the diversity of the genus is a recent 
addition, Agrobacterium tomkonis, which was isolated from the 
surface of the observation dome on the International Space Station 
[5, 6].

The ability of Agrobacterium strains to transfer and integrate 
part of their DNA into the host genome deﬁnes their unique 
relationship with plants. The tumor- and root-inducing (Ti and 
Ri, respectively) plasmids of Agrobacteria contain T-DNA, a region 
ﬂanked by conserved 25 bp regions that deﬁne the area transferred 
into the plant cell and facilitate its integration into the host 
genome. Ti plasmids also encode genes for oncogenesis and viru-
lence factors that facilitate the delivery of the T-DNA into plants. In 
nature, phytopathogenic Agrobacteria are chemotactically attracted 
by phenolic compounds secreted from plant lesions and wound 
sites. In addition to attracting the bacteria, plant-derived phenolics 
simultaneously activate the transcription of the vir genes in the Ti 
plasmid. 
In 
the 
agroinﬁltration 
procedure 
described 
here, 
acetosyringone, a phenolic metabolite produced in plants as part 
of pattern-triggered immune responses, plays the role of the 
inducer. Acetosyringone is not only a potent activator of the vir 
genes but also enhances Ti plasmid copy number, which can pro-
mote transformation efﬁciency [7]. Interestingly, when combined 
with peroxidases, acetosyringone was found to inhibit the growth 
of some pathogenic bacteria [8]. In Agrobacteria, the newly synthe-
sized vir gene products excise the T-DNA from the Ti plasmid. The 
T-DNA is then transported to the plant cell and targeted to the 
nucleus for mRNA synthesis and eventual integration into the 
genome. An enormous variety of gene expression constructs, 
including full-length infectious viral cDNAs (icDNAs), can be 
inserted between the T-DNA’s left and right borders for delivery 
into and expression in plant cells (Fig. 1). 
The molecular details of the T-DNA transfer and integration 
processes have been recently reviewed in detail by Gelvin [9] and 
Hwang et al. [10]. Currently, strains commonly used for agroinﬁl-
tration are non-oncogenic. In these strains, the tumorigenic nopa-
line synthesis and vir genes have been removed from the Ti 
plasmids. Instead, the T-DNA borders and vir genes are present 
on separate plasmids [11–13]. Because they assist in the T-DNA 
transfer process, the plasmids hosting the vir genes are called 
“helper plasmids” (Fig. 1). The initiation of virus infections by 
agroinﬁltration depends not only on the successful expression of 
the viral icDNA in the host cell but also on the coordinated repli-
cation, translation, encapsidation, and movement of the virus, a 
process outlined in Fig. 2 using potato virus A (PVA) as an example. 
PVA is a potyvirus with a circa 10 kb single-stranded positive-sense 
RNA 
genome 
[14]. 
Replicated 
potyviral 
genomes 
have 
a

characteristic viral protein, VPg (viral protein genome-linked), 
covalently attached to the 5′ end of the genome and a poly-A tail.

construct, the PVA icDNA is tagged with the Renilla luciferase (RLUC) reporter gene. Black arrows on the 
construct denote the T-DNA left and right borders. In addition, the bacterium harbors a helper plasmid 
encoding the vir genes required for the expression and transfer of the T-DNA into the host plant.

Agroinﬁltration-mediated viral infections were ﬁrst accom-
plished with the DNA virus cauliﬂower mosaic virus in turnips in 
1986 [15] and a few years later with the RNA virus tobacco mosaic 
virus in the model plant Nicotiana benthamiana (N. benthamiana) 
[16]. Traditionally, virus infections were initiated by mechanical 
inoculation with material from infected plants. The mechanical 
inoculation approach is robust and effective but has drawbacks 
and limitations. First, it requires sufﬁcient intact and infectious 
virus particles in the source material. This requirement excludes 
the possibility of studying virus mutants that do not produce stable 
particles. Second, it is difﬁcult to quantitate the virus load intro-
duced during the inoculation, which is performed by rubbing the 
leaf with the inoculum mixed with an abrasive such as carborun-
dum. Third, in mechanical inoculation, the applied pressure can 
damage the inoculated leaf, so it is impossible to obtain samples 
from where the infection was introduced. 
Because it is independent of the availability of virions, initiating 
infections via icDNA in an Agrobacterium-hosted binary vector 
enables the study of non-replicating, movement-deﬁcient, or oth-
erwise compromised virus mutants that cannot be mechanically 
inoculated. Moreover, it does not require specialized equipment 
such as electroporators or particle bombardment instruments for 
biolistic transformation. It is currently the most efﬁcient method 
for conducting controlled plant–virus infections [17]. Agroinﬁltra-
tion allows the convenient control of the quantity of bacteria 
introduced to the plant by adjusting the inﬁltration parameters,

including the optical density of the suspension (optical density at 
600 nm, OD600). For experimental purposes, initiating infections 
at different saturation levels is often desirable. For example, a low 
percentage of initially infected cells is advantageous when investi-
gating the short-distance movement of the virus to neighboring 
cells. On the other hand, the detection of non-replicating mutant

Fig. 2 Overview of the initiation of plant virus infections using agroinﬁltration. 
Agrobacterium carrying the viral icDNA in the T-DNA region of the Ti plasmid is 
cultivated, harvested, and resuspended in induction buffer containing acetosyr-
ingone as the activator of vir gene expression. The Agrobacterium suspension is 
inﬁltrated into host plant leaves using a needleless syringe. Inﬁltrated Agrobac-
terium cells attach to the host cell surface and initiate the excision and transfer 
of the T-DNA segment. In the nucleus, the T-DNA including the viral icDNA 
expression construct, is transcribed into mRNA. Capped transcripts are exported 
into the cytoplasm for protein synthesis. Viral proteins, together with auxiliary 
host factors, engage in the replication of the viral genome. New genomes 
provide templates for further translation of virus proteins, engage in cell-to-
cell movement, and at later stages are encapsidated into particles that carry the 
infection to upper leaves via the phloem. (Figure created in BioRender.com)

viruses may require that a high ratio of the cells initially receives the 
viral icDNA.
Agroinoculation with Viral icDNAs

The method consists of three parts: [1] the culture and prepa-
ration of Agrobacteria,  [2] the inﬁltration procedure, and [3] 
recommendations 
for 
the 
optimization 
of 
agroinﬁltration-
mediated infection assays and sampling. In addition, it includes 
suggestions for the safe management of infected plant material 
and agrobacterium waste. First, Agrobacterium carrying the viral 
icDNA is inoculated and cultured in selective media to increase cell 
density. The cells are then harvested, washed, and resuspended at 
the desired OD600 in induction buffer containing a high acetosyr-
ingone concentration to activate the transcription of vir genes. 
After a short recovery period, the Agrobacterium suspension is 
inﬁltrated 
with 
a 
small 
syringe 
into 
the 
abaxial 
side 
of 
N. benthamiana leaves. The inﬁltrated plants are maintained in 
standard conditions until sampling at the chosen time, days post-
inﬁltration (dpi), and location.

Methods 
Perform all steps of the agroinﬁltration protocol at room tempera-
ture. Use appropriate personal protective equipment: for example, 
when inﬁltrating plants, wear a laboratory coat, gloves, and safety 
goggles. When preparing plates and media, work in a biological 
safety cabinet to avoid contamination. Prior to starting, obtain 
relevant 
permissions 
for 
working 
with 
genetically 
modiﬁed 
(GM) viruses, Agrobacterium strains, and plants infected with mod-
iﬁed viruses. Similarly, ensure that laboratories, greenhouses, and 
other working facilities’ safety and containment levels comply with 
national and international legislation for GM organisms. 
3.1 
Agrobacterium 
Culture and 
Preparation of 
Agrobacterium 
Suspensions for 
Inﬁltration 
1. Streak the A. tumefaciens strain carrying the viral icDNA con-
struct and/or other constructs of interest on LB agar plates 
supplemented with appropriate antibiotics or refresh the cul-
ture by streaking from a glycerol stock stored at -70 °C. 
2. Incubate the plates for 16–48 h at 28 °C (see Note 8). 
3. Prepare primary cultures by inoculating a small amount of 
bacteria from the LB agar plate into 3–5 mL MES-buffered 
LB medium supplemented with acetosyringone and appropri-
ate antibiotics. Incubate overnight at 28 °C with shaking at 
200–220 rpm. 
4. The next day, prepare secondary cultures by diluting the pri-
mary culture 1:10 in fresh MES-buffered LB medium with 
appropriate antibiotics. For example, add 500 μL of the over-
night primary culture to 4.5 mL of fresh medium. The volumes

can be scaled down or up according to the ﬁnal target volume 
and OD600 (see Note 9). 
5. Incubate at 28 °C with shaking (200–220 rpm) for at least 3 h 
(see Note 10). 
6. Harvest the bacteria by centrifugation at room temperature for 
5 min at 5000×g. Discard the supernatant. 
7. To remove traces of culture medium and antibiotics, wash the 
cells twice with distilled water. To wash, resuspend the pellet by 
gentle pipetting in 1 mL of distilled water, centrifuge for 5 min 
at 5000×g, and discard the supernatant. 
8. After the ﬁnal washing step, resuspend the cells into 1 mL of 
freshly prepared induction buffer. 
9. Measure the OD600 of the suspension with a spectrophotome-
ter or a tabletop photometer. 
10. Dilute the suspension to the desired optical density (OD600) 
and volume with the induction buffer (see Note 11). 
11. Let the cells recover at room temperature for 0.5–2 h before 
inﬁltration (see Note 12). 
3.2 
Agroinﬁltration 
of N. benthamiana 
Leaves 
1. Perform the inﬁltration into one or two fully developed 
N. benthamiana leaves with a 1-mL syringe. Mix the bacterial 
suspensions by gently inverting the tube and ﬁll the syringe 
with the suspension. Remove any bubbles that remain in the 
syringe. 
2. Press the syringe on the abaxial side of the leaf and simulta-
neously exert gentle counter-pressure with your index ﬁnger 
on the other side. Steadily inject the desired volume of bacterial 
suspension into the leaf. 
3. Successful inﬁltration can be observed by the spreading of the 
inﬁltration mixture in the leaf. If a larger agroinﬁltrated area is 
required, repeat the inﬁltration at a new location until the 
target leaf area is soaked with the bacterial suspension. 
4. Inﬁltrate at least three plants per treatment or experimental 
condition. 
5. In each experiment, include an appropriate mock control treat-
ment by, for example, inﬁltrating selected plants with the 
induction buffer only. Take care to avoid contamination of 
the healthy control plants with Agrobacteria carrying the viral 
icDNA construct. 
6. After agroinﬁltration, water and maintain the treated plants in 
standard growth conditions (see Notes 6 and 13).

1. Perform trials with different OD600 values of the Agrobacter-
ium suspension to optimize the concentration according to the 
needs of your experiment and the viral icDNA in use. 
3.3.1 
Optimization of the 
Concentration of the 
Agrobacterium Suspension 
2. Begin the optimization with agroinﬁltration using a tenfold 
dilution series ranging from OD600 1 to 0.01 (see Notes 11 
and 14). 
3. Use replication-deﬁcient or movement-deﬁcient viruses as ref-
erence constructs to assess the effects of new mutations. 
3.3.2 
Optimization of 
Sample Collection in Plants 
Infected by the 
Agroinﬁltration Method 
1. To optimize the sampling time for locally infected leaves, 
obtain samples on consecutive days from agroinﬁltrated leaves. 
A time-course analysis will reveal the progress and peak of the 
infection in the local leaves. For a shorter range, you may 
consider obtaining samples already at consecutive hours post-
inﬁltration. 
2. To study the local infection in the agroinﬁltrated leaves, sample 
the agroinﬁltrated area around the inﬁltration point at, for 
example, 1–7 dpi. 
3. Avoid the syringe scar and, to reduce variance, obtain samples 
from an equal distance from the application site (see Note 15). 
4. To study the spread of the infection in the plant and to ﬁnd the 
optimal sampling time for the systemic infection, obtain sam-
ples from upper leaves on consecutive days (see Note 16). 
5. Obtain samples from near the base of young upper leaves at, for 
example, 4–10 dpi (see Note 17). 
3.3.3 
GM Waste 
Management 
1. Even contained work with GM organisms requires permission. 
Work in compliance with the appropriate safety regulations for 
the use of GMs. 
2. Sterilize agroinﬁltrated and subsequent systemically infected 
plant material by autoclaving. 
3. Sterilize reusable plastics and glassware by autoclaving or dis-
infecting with a chlorine-based solution by submerging and 
soaking the equipment for 24 h in a 10% solution (see Note 
18).

Notes 
1. The protocol has been optimized for the PVA-N. benthamiana 
pathosystem, but it can be readily applied and adapted with 
case-speciﬁc modiﬁcations or preferences for use in other 
positive-sense RNA virus–host combinations. A range of 
A. tumefaciens strains with modiﬁed characteristics, for exam-
ple, improved transformation efﬁciency in recalcitrant hosts,

reduced recombination rate, etc., are also available [18]. Here, 
A. tumefaciens strain C58C1 ((pGV2260 (pTiB6S3ΔT-DNA)) 
is used as the host for the binary, disarmed Ti plasmid pBIN19 
carrying the full-length PVA icDNA (Gene Bank accession 
no. AJ296311) tagged with a Renilla luciferase reporter 
(Fig. 3) [19, 20]. pBIN19 confers kanamycin resistance (con-
centration for selection 50 μg/mL), and the host strain carries 
a helper plasmid, which requires carbenicillin (100 μg/mL) for 
selection [21]. 
2. Precipitate may form in the acetosyringone stock during stor-
age at -20 °C. Vigorous vortexing combined with warming to 
30 °C may help dissolve the precipitates. Ensure that all pre-
cipitates have dissolved prior to using the stock solution. 
DMSO is harmful; wear appropriate protective equipment 
when handling the chemical. 
3. Prepare LB medium (tryptone 10 g/L, NaCl 5 g/L, yeast 
extract 5 g/L, adjust pH to 7.0) and sterilize by autoclaving. 
Cool the medium to room temperature. To prepare 100 mL of 
buffered LB medium for Agrobacterium cultivation, add 2 mL 
of 0.5 M MES buffer pH 6.5, 13 μL of 150 mM AS, 500 μL of  
kanamycin (stock 10 mg/mL), and 1 mL of carbenicillin (stock 
10 mg/mL) to 90 mL of LB medium. Fill to 100 mL with LB 
and use immediately or store at 4 °C. 
4. To prepare 100 mL of the induction buffer, mix 2 mL 0.5 M 
MES buffer pH 6.5, 100 μL 150 mM acetosyringone, and 
1 mL of 1 M MgCl2 and ﬁll with distilled water up to 
100 mL. Use immediately, and do not store. 
5. The 4–6 leaf development stage is recommended for the inﬁl-
tration of virus constructs. In standard growth conditions, the 
seedlings reach this stage approximately 4–5 weeks after sow-
ing. The expression of both a PVA icDNA construct and a 
standard protein expression construct, 35S-ﬁreﬂy luciferase, 
was less efﬁcient when larger leaves in older plants were inﬁl-
trated [20]. For a single experiment, use plants of the same age 
and select plants as uniform in size as possible. Do not let the 
seedlings dry at any point during growth, as drying may render 
the leaves difﬁcult to inﬁltrate. Wilted plants should not be 
inﬁltrated at all. 
6. Standard growth conditions for N. benthamiana in a con-
trolled greenhouse environment: 16-h light/ 8-h dark photo-
period at 22/20 °C respectively, 60% relative humidity. 
7. The pH of the MES buffer varies between laboratories using 
agroinﬁltration techniques, and it seems that a slightly acidic 
range works well. Preferably choose a pH between 5.6 and 6.5. 
Agroinﬁltration tests in the laboratory of Teemu Teeri (Depart-
ment of Agricultural Sciences, University of Helsinki) showed

PVA icDNA is in the pBin19 binary vector under the control of the 35S promoter and the nos terminator. The 
icDNA includes the Renilla luciferase reporter gene (RLUC) between the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (NIb) 
and coat protein (CP) cistrons. Black arrows on the construct denote the T-DNA left and right borders. 
(Figure created in BioRender.com) 
there was no difference in the transient expression of a Petunia 
hybrida dihydroﬂavonol 4-reductase using a pH 5.6 or 6.0 
induction buffer (T. Teeri, University of Helsinki Department 
of Agricultural Sciences, personal communication, February 
14, 2022). This gives some indication of the ﬂexible range of 
the pH of the induction buffer. 
8. The plates may be sealed with tape or paraﬁlm and stored at 4 ° 
C. A. tumefaciens stays fresh on appropriately stored plates for 
circa 1 week, after which new plates should be streaked. 
9. The next day, check the growth of the primary culture by 
visually assessing the cloudiness of the culture as compared to 
the non-inoculated culture medium. Optional: measure the 
OD600 of the primary overnight culture to verify sufﬁcient 
cell density. 
10. In LB medium at 28 °C, A. tumefaciens cells divide at approxi-
mately 90 min intervals. Grow the Agrobacteria for at least two 
cell cycles in the secondary culture but do not allow the cells to 
reach the stationary phase. The best results are obtained using 
Agrobacterium in the logarithmic growth phase, which in the 
strain C58C1 corresponds to OD600 0.2–1.4 [20]. 
11. The optimal OD600 varies between constructs, viruses, and 
hosts. Thus, inﬁltration parameters should be experimentally 
veriﬁed for each virus construct. For example, a wild-type PVA

Agroinoculation with Viral icDNAs
43
icDNA construct with the Renilla luciferase reporter is often 
inﬁltrated in N. benthamiana at a low OD600 (0.05), while the 
replication-deﬁcient mutant PVAΔGDD requires a ﬁvefold 
higher OD600 (0.2) [20]. All gene expression from the 
non-replicating virus is derived from the primary mRNA tran-
script generated from the T-DNA in the nucleus, and to 
achieve a detectable level of the virus it is, therefore, necessary 
to saturate the host tissue with the icDNA construct. To illus-
trate the effect of OD600 on the density of initially infected 
cells, N. benthamiana leaves were inﬁltrated at decreasing 
OD600 0.1, 0.01, and 0.001 with Agrobacterium carrying a 
binary Ti plasmid with non-replicating PVA, which does not 
move from cell to cell. Visualization of virus-derived GFP at 
3 dpi showed that with the highest OD600 (0.1), almost all cells 
expressed GFP and therefore contained the viral icDNA 
(Fig. 4). Agroinﬁltration with a tenfold dilution, 0.01, resulted 
in a marked reduction in the ratio of infected vs. non-infected 
cells and with the most dilute suspension (0.001), only scat-
tered 
individual 
cells 
were 
observed 
to 
express 
virus-
derived GFP. 
12. Although the recovery period is ﬂexible, shorter times may be 
beneﬁcial and result in more robust expression levels. Com-
pared to a 3-h recovery, a 0.5-h recovery resulted in improved 
expression of a Petunia hybrida dihydroﬂavonol 4-reductase 
(T. Teeri, University of Helsinki Department of Agricultural 
Sciences, personal communication, February 14, 2022). The 
effect of the recovery period on the initiation of virus infections 
has not been tested, but we recommend using a consistent 
recovery time between experiments. 
13. Optionally, the inﬁltrated plants may be covered overnight 
with a light cloth or plastic to reduce transpiration. In the 
case of mild or asymptomatic viruses, the agroinﬁltrated areas 
will recover quickly, although a small scar will form at the site of 
the syringe application. Depending on the virus, strain, and 
robustness of the infection, over time, more severe symptoms 
and even necrosis may occur in the agroinﬁltrated area. 
14. The timing and location of sampling should be optimized 
independently for each virus construct and host plant combi-
nation. In addition, consider the sensitivity of detection meth-
ods and the possible differences in the turnover rate of 
reporters and viral proteins. 
15. Due to the dilution of the Agrobacterium solution during 
spread into the leaf tissue, expression levels decrease with 
increasing distance from the inﬁltration site [20]. Therefore, 
it is recommended to obtain samples at a uniform distance and 
from as close to the inﬁltration site as possible. In addition, use

Fig. 4 Effect of the OD600 of the Agrobacterium suspension on the density of initially infected epidermal cells in 
N. benthamiana at 3 dpi. Leaves were inﬁltrated with Agrobacterium hosting non-replicating potato virus A 
tagged with a GFP reporter at OD600 0.1, 0.01, and 0.001. GFP ﬂuorescence (top row) was visualized from leaf 
disks at 3 dpi with epiﬂuorescence microscopy using a FITC ﬁlter, and brightﬁeld images (BF, bottom row) 
were obtained with a VIS ﬁlter. Mock control plants were inﬁltrated with buffer. The scale bars represent 
100 μm 
suitable analysis methods to distinguish between active viral 
gene expression and virus titers (i.e., the accumulation of virus 
particles). For example, the Renilla luciferase reporter signal, 
indicating viral gene expression, is detectable at 24 h after 
inﬁltration, but an ELISA test detecting the accumulation of 
PVA coat protein was ﬁrst positive at 52 h post-inﬁltration 
[20]. For quantitative real-time PCR analysis of viral transcripts 
in the agroinﬁltrated leaves, be aware that there may still be 
agrobacteria present that carry the Ti plasmid copies of the viral 
icDNA. Any such icDNA copies will affect the outcome of the 
analysis and may do so signiﬁcantly, especially at early sampling 
times. 
16. The timing of the systemic spread may vary from less than a 
week to several weeks, depending on the virus, Agrobacterium 
strain, and host. It should therefore be experimentally veriﬁed 
on a case-by-case basis. 
17. Long-distance movement of plant viruses occurs primarily via 
the phloem, where virus particles are passively transported 
among the ﬂow of photoassimilates. The direction of move-
ment is from source to sink tissues. The systemic infection is 
often initiated near the base of the upper leaves, possibly 
because that is where viruses ﬁrst exit the phloem.

nate bacteria and viruses. For example, within the EU select a 
virucide in compliance with the European standard EN 14476.

Construction of Geminivirus Infectious Clones 
for Agroinoculation into Plants 
Ivair J. Morais, Alice K. Inoue-Nagata, and Erich Y. T. Nakasu 
Abstract 
The production of geminiviral infectious clones provides a standardized inoculum for use in several host– 
virus studies. Geminiviruses present either one (monopartite) or two (bipartite) circular single-stranded 
DNA components, which commonly range from 2.6 to 2.8 kb. Cloning of a monomeric genome is useful 
for obtaining its precise sequence. For infectious clones, however, it is essential that more than one copy of 
the genome, more speciﬁcally of the origin of replication, is present in order to guarantee the production of 
full-length progeny DNA. Here, the complete process of preparing infectious geminiviral clones is 
described starting from the DNA extraction and selection of restriction endonucleases followed by two 
protocols for constructing dimeric clones: restriction endonuclease digestion and ligation (1) and Gibson 
Assembly (2). 
Key words Rolling circle ampliﬁcation, Geminivirus, Infectious clone, Circular ssDNA virus, Gibson

Introduction 
Geminiviruses comprise a signiﬁcant group of viruses that infect 
plants. Their genomes consist of either one or two single-stranded 
circular DNA molecules, each ranging from 2.6 to 2.8 kilobases in 
size. Most geminivirus genomes have a 9-nucleotide motif (TAA-
TATT/AC), known as the origin of replication, in which the viral 
protein Rep cleaves the DNA during replication. The production of 
geminivirus infectious clones involves the dimeric cloning of each 
genomic component (implying two copies of the origin of replica-
tion) and insertion into a binary vector for agroinoculation into 
plants using Agrobacterium tumefaciens. 
Two protocols are presented here for the construction of infec-
tious clones of geminiviruses. The ﬁrst (see Subheading 3.6) con-
sists of ligating dimeric genomic DNA to a binary vector, as 
described in Ferreira et al. (2008) [1]. These dimeric molecules

are produced by partial digestion of the rolling circle ampliﬁcation 
(RCA) products with a single-cutting restriction endonuclease 
(RE) and isolation of the dimer DNA fragments from agarose 
gels. Prior to this step, a pilot test is needed to deﬁne the appropri-
ate RE and adjust the digestion protocol to enrich the preparation 
with partially digested dimeric units.
48
Ivair J. Morais et al.
The second protocol (see Subheading 3.7) is based on Gibson 
Assembly [2], which was optimized for generating geminiviral 
infectious clones [3, 4]. A sequence of the genome is used to design 
two sets of primers. These primers are used in high-ﬁdelity PCR 
protocols to generate two full-size genome amplicons (termed U1 
and U2) with complementary ends. The 5′ and 3′ ends of the U1 
amplicon will overlap at least 15 nucleotides between the vector and 
the 5′ end of U2, respectively, and the U2 copy will overlap the 5′
part of the vector at its 3′ end. The three fragments (U1, U2, and 
vector) are ligated with each other by a sequence of steps involving 
reactions of exonuclease, polymerase, and ligase before insertion 
into bacterial cells. 
The ﬁrst step for both protocols consists of total DNA extrac-
tion from an infected plant. We present a protocol based on the 
different solubility of polysaccharides and DNA developed by 
Doyle and Doyle (1987) [5]. Then, RCA is employed to generate 
several multimers of circular DNAs in the sample—in this case, 
geminiviral genomes—even from very low amounts of template 
[6]. Due to its strand displacement nature during polymerization 
[7], single-stranded DNAs are readily available as templates. 
Once ampliﬁed, a preliminary analysis of the viral genome is 
carried out using restriction fragment length polymorphism 
(RFLP) to determine whether the sample contains a monopartite, 
bipartite, or even more than one geminivirus infecting the plant. 
Then, a single-cutter RE is identiﬁed for cloning if based on diges-
tion and ligation protocol; for bipartite geminiviruses, a Southern 
blot is used to determine the RE speciﬁc for each component. For 
the construction of geminivirus infectious clones using Gibson 
assembly, however, the sequence of at least part of the genome is 
required for primer design. For this purpose, two sets of universal 
begomovirus primers (DNA-A and DNA-B), designed by Rojas 
et al. (1993) [8], are convenient for PCR ampliﬁcation and 
sequencing.

period. 
3.3 
Analysis of the 
DNA Proﬁle After 
Digestion with a 
Frequent-Cutter RE 
1. RCA products are visualized in agarose gels by loading 1 μL in a  
0.8% agarose gel in TBE buffer (see Note 17). 
2. On the same gel, run digested RCA products: Digest 1 μL of  
RCA product in a reaction with 1 μL 10× reaction buffer, 
1–5 U of MspI RE, and adjust the volume to 10 μL. Incubate 
for >1 h. Load the reaction in the agarose gel. 
3. Visualize the gel under UV light using the preferred DNA 
staining dye (see Note 18). An example is given in Fig. 1. 
3.4 
Partial 
Sequencing Using 
Universal Begomovirus 
Primers 
1. Dilute the RCA products to 100 ng/μL (usually 1–4 μL RCA/ 
10 μL) and Sanger sequence using primers PAR1c496 and 
PAL1v1978 for DNA-A and primers PCRc2 and PBLv2040 
for DNA-B (see Note 19). 
2.  Analyze by BLAST  (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast. 
cgi) [9]. 
3. If appropriate, use the partial sequence for designing primers 
for Gibson assembly cloning (see Subheading 3.7).

3.5 
Identiﬁcation of 
Single-Cutting RE 
1. Select the binary vector for cloning (e.g., pCAMBIA 0380) 
and several REs in the vector’s multiple cloning site (MCS). 
3.5.1 
RCA Digestion and 
Agarose Gel 
Electrophoresis Separation 
2. Digest 1 μL of RCA product with each RE separately. 
3. Load the digestion reaction on a 0.8–1.0% agarose gel. 
4. Stain the DNA with the preferred DNA stain. 
5. Identify those REs that produced genome size DNA fragments 
of 2.6–2.8 kb. (see Note 20). 
6. Select the preferred RE for cloning using the method of RE 
digestion and ligation (see Subheading 3.6). 
7. If the geminivirus is a bipartite begomovirus, proceed to Sub-
headings 3.5.2, 3.5.3, and 3.5.4 for Southern blotting. 
3.5.2 
DNA Transfer and 
Membrane Fixation for 
Bipartite Begomoviruses 
1. After choosing the REs to identify those present in DNA-A or 
DNA-B, run the digested RCA with the REs in a 0.9–1% 
agarose gel. Prepare two identical gels, one for the DNA-A 
probe and another for the DNA-B probe. 
2. Stain the DNA and observe if the digestions were complete for 
each enzyme. 
3. Remove parts of the gel that are not necessary. Soak the gel in 
denaturation solution, enough to cover the entire gel in a tray, 
and incubate at RT under slow agitation on an orbital shaker 
for 20 min. 
4. Remove the denaturation solution and repeat the process once. 
5. Remove the denaturation solution and cover the gel with the 
neutralization solution. Keep the tray at RT for 15 min on an 
orbital shaker under slow agitation. Repeat the process three 
times. 
6. For the transference of the DNA from the gel to the mem-
brane, half-ﬁll a tray with 20× SSC. Make a platform in the 
solution using a glass or plastic plate/tray. Soak one layer of 
ﬁlter paper in 20× SSC and lay it over the plate, dipping the 
edges into the SSC solution. Remove any air bubbles between 
the ﬁlter and the plate. 
7. Stack 3 gel-sized pieces of wet ﬁlter paper soaked in 20× SSC 
over the ﬁrst long ﬁlter paper. Lay the gel over the ﬁlter papers. 
Remove any air bubbles that remain between the gel and the 
ﬁlter papers. Place PVC plastic pieces around the gel (this will 
prevent the gel from moving and eventually falling out). 
8. Cut a piece of nylon or nitrocellulose membrane precisely the 
size of the gel, soak it in 2× SSC, and place it on top of the gel, 
removing any air bubbles that may have remained. Do not 
move the membrane once it is placed over the gel. 
9. Place two sheets of wet (2× SSC) ﬁlter papers of the gel size on 
top of the membrane. Remove air bubbles.

10. Place a wad of paper towel (~10 cm tall) on top of the ﬁlter 
paper sheets, and make sure they do not move (see Note 21). 
11. Let the transfer take place overnight. 
12. Carefully remove the paper towel (they are expected to be wet) 
and then the membrane with a pair of tweezers. 
13. Turn the membrane and make a small cut in the upper left 
corner to identify the correct side. 
14. Quickly and carefully wash the membrane with 20× SSC to 
remove any agarose pieces that may have remained attached to 
the membrane. 
15. Air-dry the membrane and store it wrapped in ﬁlter paper 
inside a plastic bag. 
16. Proceed to the hybridization step. 
3.5.3 
Pre-Hybridization 
and Hybridization 
1. Place the membranes separately in a hybridization vessel. The 
DNA side should face the tube inward. Add 5–10 mL of 
pre-warmed (68 °C) ULTRAhyb buffer (see Note 22). 
2. Pre-hybridize at 42 °C (hybridization oven) for >30 min. At 
this stage, it is essential to keep the vessel rotating so that the 
liquid comes into contact with the entire membrane. 
3. Prepare the probes: In a PCR tube, add 10 ng template DNA 
to a PCR Master Mix, and adjust the volume to 100 μL. Mix 
well. Separate 10 μL to a new tube, and add 0.5 μL dig-dUTP 
(e.g., Roche) to the remaining solution. Perform PCR as usual 
for each primer pair. After PCR, load 5 μL of each PCR product 
in an agarose gel. The probe moves slightly slower than the 
non-labeled PCR product (see Note 23). 
4. Boil the probes for 5 min at 95 °C in a water bath, and 
immediately place them on ice for 5 min (see Note 24). 
5. Add 50 μL of denatured probe (the volume can vary depending 
on probe concentration) in the hybridization buffer. Incubate 
overnight (14–24 h) at 42 °C. 
6. Remove all ULTRAhyb mixed with the probe. Store the probe 
at -20 °C for future use. 
7. Wash the membrane twice for 5 min each with washing solu-
tion 1 at 42 °C. 
8. Wash the membrane twice for 15 min with washing solution 
2 at 42  °C. 
3.5.4 
Detection
1. Discard the wash buffer and add the blocking solution (variable 
volume, but enough to cover the entire membrane). Incubate 
for 1 h at RT. 
2. Add 0.5 μL of anti-digoxigenin-AP per 5 mL of blocking 
solution (dilution 1:10,000). Incubate for 1 h at RT.

56
Ivair J. Morais et al.
3. Discard the blocking solution and wash the membrane three 
times (10 min each) with TBS-T (variable volume). Each wash 
should last 10 min at RT. 
4. Add the substrate of alkaline phosphatase enzyme (60 μL NBT 
and 30 μL BCIP per 10 mL) in the developing buffer and 
incubate at RT for 10–60 min. Expect purple DNA bands 
revealing speciﬁc reactions (see Note 25). 
5. Store the dried membranes protected from light at RT. 
6. Choose the RE that produces one genome size DNA fragment 
that hybridizes with the DNA-A probe and another with the 
DNA-B probe (see Note 26). 
3.6 
Production of an 
Infectious Clone in a 
Binary Vector After 
Partial Digestion of 
RCA Product with a RE 
1. Determine the best reaction condition for producing dimeric 
molecules: Prepare 10 tubes (1.5 mL) and identify them from 
1 to 10. In one tube, make a master mix containing 70 μL 
water, 10 μL 10× RE buffer, and 10 μL RCA product (see 
Subheading 3.2). Mix well, and distribute 9 μL in each tube 
(10 tubes with 9 μL). Add 1 μL (4 U/μL) of the selected 
single-cutting RE (see Subheading 3.5) in tube 10; 1 μL 
(2 U/μL) in tube 9; 1 μL (1 U/μL) in tube 8; 1 μL (0.5 U/ 
μL) in tube 7; 1 μL (0.25 U/μL) in tube 6; 1 μL (0.12 U/μL) 
in tube 5; 1 μL (0.06 U/μL) in tube 4; 1 μL (0.03 U/μL) in 
tube 3; 1 μL (0.01 U/μL) in tube 2; and 1 μL water in tube 
1 (see Note 27). Incubate at the recommended incubation 
temperature for 30 min. Heat-inactivate the reaction (if the 
RE is heat-inactivated) or keep it on ice. 
3.6.1 
Preparation of 
Dimeric Viral Genome 
2. Separate the digested fragments in an agarose gel (1%) (see 
Note 28). Select the RE concentration that provides the high-
est amount of the dimeric molecule (~5.2 kb Fig. 2). 
3. Producing the dimers: Scale up the reaction 10- to 20-fold (see 
Note 29) and keep the same selected incubation time and 
inactivation method. Precipitate the DNA by adding 10% 
sodium acetate and two volumes of ethanol, and incubate at
-80 °C for >1  h  or - 20 °C overnight. Centrifuge at 
10,000 rpm for 10 min, discard the supernatant, and wash 
the pellet once by adding 1 mL of ice-cold 70% ethanol and 
centrifuging at 10,000 rpm for 5 min. Dry the pellet and 
resuspend in 20 μL 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8, and separate 
the DNA in an agarose gel. Excise the dimer DNA band from 
the gel with a sharp razor blade and elute the DNA using a 
DNA gel extraction kit. Quantify the DNA by spectrophotom-
etry or by agarose gel electrophoresis. Repeat the process until 
a ﬁnal solution of >20 ng/μL is obtained. If needed, reduce 
the volume using a Speed-Vac.

Fig. 2 RCA-ampliﬁed begomovirus DNA digested for 30 min with varying 
amounts of RE BglII (in enzyme units, above the gel). The reaction was performed 
with 7 μL water, 1 μL 10× buffer, 1 μL RCA product, and 1 μL diluted RE. The 
digestion produced monomeric (white arrow), dimeric (black arrow), and other 
partially or undigested (gray arrow) DNA molecules. In this case, the use of 1 unit 
per reaction produced the highest amount of dimeric molecules. M. 1 kb plus 
DNA size marker (ThermoFisher Scientiﬁc). Numbers on the left side represent 
fragment DNA sizes in kb. (Photograph by Dorian Y. M. Silva) 
3.6.2 
Preparation of 
Linearized Plasmid 
1. Plasmid linearization: In a tube, add 20 μL RE buffer, ~10 μg 
pCAMBIA 0380 (see Note 30), 15–30 U selected RE, and 
water to 200 μL. Incubate at the optimal temperature for 3 h, 
add more 10 U RE, and incubate overnight. Run 5 μL of the 
digestion solution in an agarose gel to check if digestion is 
complete. If still partial, add another aliquot of RE and incu-
bate >3 h until complete digestion. High quality restriction 
enzymes with the appropriate buffer (e.g., New England Bio-
labs) are preferred to avoid star activity. 
2. Plasmid dephosphorylation: After digestion is completed, add 
1 U CIAP and incubate for 5 min at 50 °C for 5′ recessed and 
blunt-ended DNA and for 5 min at 37 °C for DNA with 5′
overhang. 
3. Inactivation of CIAP: Add 200 μL phenol:chloroform:isoamyl 
alcohol, vigorously mix for 5 min, and centrifuge >10,000 rpm 
for 10 min. Collect the aqueous phase and precipitate the DNA 
by adding 10% sodium acetate and two volumes of ethanol. 
Incubate at -80 °C for >1 h  or - 20 °C overnight, and 
centrifuge 14,000 g for 5 min. Resuspend in 20 μL 10 mM  
Tris-HCl, pH 8 (see Note 31). 
4. Isolation of the plasmid: Separate the linearized and depho-
sphorylated plasmid DNA in an agarose gel. Excise the linear-
ized plasmid DNA band from the gel with a sharp razor blade 
and elute the DNA using a DNA gel extraction kit. Quantify 
the DNA by spectrophotometry or by agarose gel electropho-
resis. The desired concentration is 50 ng/μL.

3.6.3 
Ligation, 
Transformation, and 
Selection of Recombinant 
Plasmids 
1. Ligation and transformation: In a tube, mix 1 μL 10× T4 DNA 
ligase buffer, 50 ng linearized and dephosphorylated pCAM-
BIA 0380 (see Subheading 3.6.2), 150 ng dimer (see Subhead-
ing 3.6.1), and 1 U T4 DNA ligase and adjust with water to 
10 μL. For sticky ends, incubate at 22 °C for 10 min. For blunt 
ends, add 1 μL 50% PEG 4000 to the mixture and 5 U of T4 
DNA ligase and incubate at 22 °C for 1 h. 
2. Dialysis of the ligation reaction: Float a piece of a ﬁlter mem-
brane (0.22 μm) on water and place the ligation reaction on 
top. Incubate for 15 min. Then, remove the ligation reaction 
and carefully transfer it to a tube. Use 1–2 μL for electrocom-
petent cells or up to 5 μL to transform 50 μL of chemically 
competent cells. Plate 50–200 μL in LB/agar plates containing 
kanamycin or a suitable antibiotic and incubate for 1–2 days at 
28 °C or RT (see Note 32). 
3. Selection of recombinant plasmids: Select six colonies and purify 
the plasmids. Grow selected bacteria in 5 mL liquid LB medium 
with the appropriate antibiotics at 28 °C overnight. Pellet the 
bacterial cells (10,000 rpm, 5 min) and resuspend in 100 μL 
alkaline lysis solution I. Add 200 μL alkaline lysis solution II, 
invert the tube, and incubate on ice for 5 min. Add 300 μL 
alkaline lysis solution III and invert the tube. Centrifuge at 
10,000 rpm for 5 min, collect the supernatant (500–600 μL), 
and add 1 volume of isopropanol. Invert the tube. Centrifuge at 
12,000 rpm for 10 min, eliminate supernatant, and rinse the 
pellet with 70% cold ethanol. Air-dry the pellet for 5 min and 
resuspend in 50 μL 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8. 
4. Digest with 2 REs separately. The ﬁrst is the RE used to prepare 
the dimer and plasmid, resulting in 1 vector size (~6.8 kb) 
fragment and a monomer size (~2.6 kb) fragment. Select a 
second RE present only once in the vector and absent in the 
virus genome. This will produce a single fragment of ~12.0 kb. 
Purify at least two clones using a plasmid puriﬁcation kit, such 
as GenElute Plasmid Miniprep Kit (Sigma-Aldrich), and 
sequence to check if they were correctly cloned (see Note 33). 
3.7 
Production of an 
Infectious Clone in a 
Binary Vector by 
Gibson Assembly 
1. Perform PCR for each of the three components using Q5 DNA 
polymerase. Use 98 °C for denaturing and allow ~30 s/kb 
during extension. Amplify a whole-genome copy of the gemi-
nivirus using primers U1-F and U1-R, another using U2-F and 
U2-R, and the vector using pJL89-F and pJL89-R (see 
Note 10). 
2. Run PCR in a 1% agarose gel and stain with crystal violet dye 
(see Note 34). 
3. Proceed to DNA puriﬁcation from excised gel bands using an 
appropriate gel elution kit. Digest gel-puriﬁed pJL 89 with 
DpnI for 1 h at 37 °C to eliminate methylated DNA (i.e., 
undigested circular vectors).

Construction of Geminivirus Infectious Clones

4. Quantify each puriﬁed PCR product using spectrophotometry 
at 260 nm and calculate the amount needed for each, ranging 
from 0.02 to 0.5 pmols (see Note 35). In this case, use at least 
60 ng of PCR-ampliﬁed pJL 89 and a two- to threefold molar 
excess of each insert. Keep the tubes on ice. 
5. Add inserts and the vector in a 0.2-mL tube and water to a ﬁnal 
volume of 10 μL if needed. Add 10 μL of 2× Gibson Assembly 
Master Mix and immediately incubate at 50 °C for 15 to 
60 min. The reaction can then be kept on ice or at -20 °C 
prior to transformation. 
6. Transform electrocompetent E. coli DH10β with 2 μL of the 
reaction (as described in Subheading 3.6.3). 
7. To conﬁrm that the dimer was correctly cloned, select up to 
10 colonies and extract plasmids, as described in Subheading 
3.6.3. Use a single-cut enzyme speciﬁc to pJL 89 (see Note 36) 
and check whether DNA size is >9 kb; monomers should yield 
a ~ 7.5 kb product.

Notes 
1. Store the buffer without 2-mercaptoethanol at RT. Add 
2-mercaptoethanol before use; this compound is toxic and 
must be handled carefully. 
2. The cell lysis step can be performed manually using a pestle and 
mortar or using a cell homogenizer for fresh or frozen tissue 
powdered in liquid nitrogen. 
3. A complete set of reagents is provided by some companies 
(e.g., 
Illustra 
TempliPhi 
Ampliﬁcation

If 
n-hexamer primers are not provided, purchase random hexam-
ers that are thiol-modiﬁed in their two last nucleotides at the 
3′ end. 
4. Dilute to 0.5× before use. Use it for all electrophoresis separa-
tion steps described in this chapter. 
5. Select the binary vector (e.g., pCambia 0380), and use unique 
REs that are present in the vector. 
6. Select a plasmid vector with a high copy number and contain-
ing origins of replication for both Escherichia coli and Agrobac-
terium tumefaciens (syn. Rhizobium radiobacter), i.e., a binary 
vector. pCAMBIA 0380 (6813 bp) is a plant expression binary 
vector, and its presence induces kanamycin resistance to trans-
formed bacteria. 
7. We routinely use E. coli strains DH5α or DH10β for this 
purpose.

8. Preparation of SOC medium. To 950 mL of deionized H2O, 
add 20 g tryptone, 5 g yeast extract, 0.5 g NaCl, 10 mL 
250 mM KCl, pH 7.0 adjusted with NaOH, for 1 L. Sterilize 
by autoclaving. Just before use, add 5 mL of a sterile solution of 
2 M MgCl2. This medium is known as SOB medium. For the 
preparation of the SOC medium, add 20 mL of a sterile 1 M 
solution of glucose (sterilized by passing it through a 0.22-μm 
ﬁlter) per liter of SOB. 
9. Designing of abutting primers for the geminivirus genome (see 
Fig. 3): one pair of primers for each monomer. The nonanu-
cleotide region must be avoided when designing primers, as it

must be present at least twice for correct processing. Aim for 
annealing temperatures above 60 °C (considering PCR with 
Q5 DNA polymerase). The U1-F primer must include a com-
plementary region to the vector pJL89 at its 5′ (e.g., 
AACATGGTGGAGCACGACAC) end, followed by the target 
sequence in the geminivirus genome at its 3′ end. The reverse 
primer (U1-R) should be 30–40-nt long and must be designed 
immediately upstream (abutting) the forward primer, contain-
ing a ~ 15 nucleotide overlap sequence with AU2-F primer. 
The second primer pair must comprise a forward primer 
(AU2-F) complementary to part (~15 nt) of U1-R and an 
abutting reverse primer complementary to both pJL89 at its 
5′ end (e.g., GAACGATCGGGGAAATTCGA) and target 
begomovirus at the 3′ end. There is no need to produce a 
dimeric genome for infectious clones. It is important to intro-
duce two copies of the origin of replication, resulting in more 
than one copy of the genome. 
10. It is advisable to amplify pJL89 vector by PCR using 
primers 
F 
(TCGAATTTCCCCGATCGTTC) 
and 
R 
(GTGTCGTGCTCCACCATGTT), as described by Ferro 
et al. (2019) [4]. 
11. Exposure to UV light may damage DNA molecules. We rec-
ommend staining with crystal violet stain (0.01 mg/mL) and 
exposure to white light for DNA band excision. Note that 
crystal violet is less sensitive than other DNA staining dyes. 
12. Samples can be kept at RT before incubation at 65 °C. 
13. The production of a whitish translucent pellet is expected. If a 
dark pellet is formed, issues in downstream procedures may 
occur. 
14. A speed-vacuum equipment can be used to optimize this step, 
but do not over-dry, as DNA might not resuspend later. 
15. Avoid repeated freeze-thawing procedures as they damage 
the DNA. 
16. Alternatively, the tubes may also be kept at RT. Avoid incuba-
tion for more than 48 h. 
17. A high molecular weight DNA band is observed near the wells. 
An amount of >1 μg is expected per μL of reaction. 
18. MspI digests DNA at the site CCGG, but any other 4-base 
cutter RE can be used. After staining, ≥1 DNA band is 
expected. Sum up the digested fragment sizes. Non-digested 
DNA fragments of high molecular weight may be present as 
well. If the result is ~2.6 kb, there is a monopartite geminivirus 
in the sample. If the sum is >5.2, there is a bipartite begomo-
virus or a mixed infection of ≥2 geminiviruses (see Fig. 1).

19. Universal primers for begomoviruses: PAR1c496 (AATACTG 
CAGGGCTTYCTRTACATRGG), PAL1v1978 (GCATCTG 
CAGGCCCACATYGTCTTYCCNGT), PCRc2 (CTAGCTG 
CAGCATATTTACRARWATGCC) and PBL1v2040 (GCCT 
CTGCAGCARTGRTCKATCTTCATACA), as described in 
Rojas et al., (1993) [7]. If it is not a begomovirus, search for 
a universal primer pair for the genus. 
20. If a RE site is present in only one site in the viral genome, there 
will be 1 DNA band of genome size in the gel. Carefully check 
if small DNA bands are not present in the bottom of the gel. 
These REs are potentially helpful for the construction of infec-
tious clones. If a bipartite begomovirus is the target for clon-
ing, go to Subheading 3.5.2 to identify REs speciﬁc to DNA-A 
and DNA-B. 
21. If necessary, isolate the ﬁlter paper stack above the gel from the 
ﬁlter under the gel. This method will avoid movement of the 
SSC solution from the tray to the paper towel sheets. 
22. Add enough buffer to cover the membrane entirely. 
23. Prepare a probe for DNA-A and another for DNA-B. In gen-
eral, probes produced using a geminivirus as a template will 
hybridize efﬁciently with other geminiviruses of the same 
genus but wash less stringently when dealing with an unknown 
geminivirus. 
24. This denaturation step is only done when the probe has never 
been used. The probes can be used up to four times. 
25. The substrate is photosensitive and should be protected from 
light. This process can also be done using other substrates, 
such as chemiluminescence CDP-Star (Sigma-Aldrich). 
26. If the same RE site is present in both DNA-A and DNA-B, it 
can be conveniently used to clone both components. 
27. Dilute RE to each ﬁnal concentration in water immediately 
before use. 
28. For these reactions, a decreasing amount of RE is added to 
obtain the desired partial digestion of the RCA products. For 
the best RE concentration, it is expected to observe a ladder, 
consisting of DNA fragments of genome size (~2.6 kb), dimer 
(~5.2 kb), trimer (~7.4 kb), and so on (see Fig. 2). Usually, the 
most abundant DNA size is that of a monomeric genome size. 
29. If the digestion pattern changes when scaled up, adjust the RE 
concentration or digestion time to achieve the highest amounts 
of dimeric molecules. 
30. Plasmid can be conveniently ampliﬁed by RCA. 
31. This step is unnecessary if the alkaline phosphatase is 100% 
heat-inactivated (e.g., Sigma’s recombinant shrimp alkaline 
phosphatase GEE70092X).

32. Use SOC medium for incubation of transformed cells at 28 °C 
for 1 h before plating the cells in LB agar medium with 
kanamycin. 
33. If no colonies are obtained, check the amount of the DNA and 
plasmid used for ligation, the ligation efﬁciency, and cells com-
petence. If none of the digests results in the expected patterns, 
repeat the process with other colonies until all colonies are 
screened. 
34. Only highly concentrated DNA can be visualized using this dye 
under white light. Run a small aliquot in another gel and stain, 
as usual, to check ampliﬁcation before staining with crystal 
violet. The primary purpose of using this method over ethi-
dium bromide (or other dyes) is to avoid DNA damage caused 
by both the chemical and the UV light. 
35. Agarose gels can also be used to estimate DNA concentration. 
To calculate pmols, use the formula: pmols = (ng of DNA) × 
1000 / (bp × 650 da). Alternatively, online calculators for 
molecular biology can be used (e.g., https://nebiocalculator. 
neb.com/). 
36. pJL 89 sequence and restriction sites can be selected on the 
webpage https://www.addgene.org/98558/. Avoid enzymes 
that also cut the viral genome, as a cloned dimer might be 
indistinguishable from a monomer.

Abstract 
Most geminiviruses are not transmitted by mechanical inoculation. Therefore, pathogenicity and plant– 
pathogen interaction studies rely on agroinoculation using infectious clones, which involves cloning the 
geminiviral genome in a binary vector (see previous chapter for details). A suspension containing the 
infectious clone inserted into Agrobacterium tumefaciens cells is then inoculated into plants, i.e., agroino-
culated. Below is a simple protocol for agroinoculation of an infectious geminivirus clone into plants.

Introduction 
Agroinoculation has been used since the mid-1980s [1, 2] as  
reliable method for completing Koch’s postulates and studying 
plant host/virus interactions using geminiviral infectious clones. 
An effective geminiviral infectious clone usually has at least two 
geminiviral species-speciﬁc origins of replication and is cloned in a 
binary vector for agroinoculation. The vector is ﬁrst inserted into a 
suitable Escherichia coli strain and then transferred to an Agrobac-
terium tumefaciens (syn. Agrobacterium radiobacter) strain for 
agroinoculation into plants.

Fig. 1 Schematic illustration of the procedures for agroinoculation of an infectious viral construct in a binary 
vector 
with vigorous shaking until the culture reaches the log phase at 
OD600 between 0.5 and 0.6 (see Note 6). Allow it to cool on 
ice for 15 min. 
3. Harvest the bacteria by centrifugation at 4000 × g for 5 min at 
4 °C. Discard the supernatant, resuspend each pellet with 
25 mL of ice-cold 150 mM NaCl, and transfer it to a 
50-mL tube. 
4. Centrifuge the suspension at 4000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. 
Discard the supernatant and resuspend the sediment in 5 mL 
of ice-cold 20 mM CaCl2. Store the cells on ice. 
5. Aliquot 100 μL of the bacterial suspension into 1.5 mL tubes 
on ice and quick-freeze in liquid nitrogen (optional). Store the 
competent cells at -80 °C. 
3.2 
Transformation 
of Chemically 
Competent A. 
tumefaciens 
1. Take one tube of competent A. tumefaciens kept at -80 °C, 
thaw on ice and add approximately 1 μg of plasmid. Mix gently 
by tapping the tube. Incubate the mixture for 20–30 min 
on ice. 
2. Heat-shock cells by placing the tube in a water bath at 37 °C for 
5 min.

68
Ivair J. Morais et al.
3. Mix the contents by gently ﬂicking the tube and add 1 mL SOC 
medium. Shake the tube at 28 °C for 2 h. 
4. Plate 100–200 μL per LB agar plate containing the appropriate 
antibiotics. 
5. Incubate the plates upside down at 28 °C for 2–3 days. 
6. Using sterile toothpicks, transfer individual colonies to new 
plates with LB agar containing the appropriate antibiotics. 
7. Incubate the plates upside down at 28 °C for 2–3 days (see 
Note 7). 
3.3 
Agroinﬁltration
1. Prepare a pre-culture by inoculating a single colony of 
A. tumefaciens transformed with your target clone in 5 mL 
LB medium with antibiotics. Incubate overnight with agita-
tion at 28 °C. 
2. Use 1 mL of the culture to inoculate 24 mL LB medium with 
antibiotics and 20 μM acetosyringone. Incubate overnight (see 
Note 8). 
3. Pellet the bacteria by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 15 min and 
resuspend the pellet in resuspension solution. Measure the 
OD600 (see Note 9). 
4. Dilute suspension to OD600 = 1.0 for agroinoculation (see 
Note 10). Concentration may be adjusted according to the 
objectives and target plants to increase infection rates. 
5. Inﬁltrate true leaves using a 1-mL syringe without the needle. 
Gently press the syringe on the abaxial side of the leaf and apply 
counter-pressure with a ﬁnger on the other side. Successful 
inﬁltration is indicated by the appearance of a wet area on the 
leaf (see Note 11). 
6. Alternatively, the infectious clone can be agroinoculated by 
pinning true leaves and stems of plantlets using a syringe needle 
while injecting the bacterial solution. 
4 
Notes 
1. Verify if the A. tumefaciens strain is resistant to rifampicin. If 
not, do not add it to the medium. 
2. Prepare SOC medium with 20 g/L tryptone, 5 g/L yeast 
extract, 0.5 g/L NaCl, and 10 mL 250 mM KCl (pH 7.0). 
Autoclave. To the cold medium, add 5 mL 2 M MgCl2 (auto-
claved). Make small aliquots and store them frozen (-20 °C) 
until use. 
3. The speciﬁc antibiotics will depend on the bacterial strain and 
the plasmid used for transformation. Usually, two antibiotics

Agroinoculation
69
are used, one to maintain A. tumefaciens helper (Ti) vector, for 
example, 100 μg/mL gentamicin, and another speciﬁc to the 
binary vector, for example, 50 μg/mL spectinomycin or kana-
mycin. Popular A. tumefaciens strains, such as GV3101 and 
LBA4404, are resistant to rifampicin. Antibiotics should be 
added to a ready-to-use medium. 
4. Add antibiotics and acetosyringone after autoclaving and use 
the medium immediately. 
5. The resuspension solution must be autoclaved before adding 
acetosyringone. Tween-80 or Tween-20 (up to 0.05% ﬁnal 
concentration) can be used to facilitate agroinﬁltration into 
leaves. 
6. This takes approximately 4–5 h. You may calculate the dou-
bling time as 2 h in the described condition. 
7. These individually transformed A. tumefaciens clones will be 
used for leaf inoculation. 
8. The overnight growth step can be skipped if sufﬁcient bacteria 
are available. 
9. The OD600 should be within the range of 0.6–1.0 for optimal 
inﬁltration. Dilute the bacterial solution if OD600 > 1.0. 
Higher bacterial concentration may induce undesired “pat-
tern-triggered immunity” in plants. Resuspension of the pellet 
in sterile water may also be used [3]. 
10. For a bipartite begomovirus inoculation, mix the bacterial 
solution of each component (DNA-A clone and DNA-B 
clone) in the same concentration. 
11. Avoid inﬁltrating the cotyledons of the leaves. Use at least 
0.2 mL for each agroinﬁltration. For cucurbits, cotyledons 
are also target for agroinoculation in many cases.

Abstract 
The use of infectious clones to inoculate plant viruses allows for controlled studies that lead to a better 
understanding of plant–virus interactions. The main methods used for laboratory inoculation of gemini-
viruses are agroinoculation and biolistics. We describe how to successfully inoculate geminiviruses, focusing 
on Arabidopsis as a model plant and cassava as a crop.

Introduction 
Geminiviruses belong to an expanding family of plant viruses that 
create many agricultural problems in tropical and subtropical areas 
of the world. They are non-enveloped viruses with small, circular 
single-stranded DNA genomes that replicate through rolling circle 
replication and recombination-dependent replication in the nuclei 
of infected plant cells [1, 2]. These viruses are transmitted by 
insects, have single or two-component genomes (mono- and bipar-
tite), and are sometimes associated with satellites with different 
characteristics [3]. These viruses can occur in mixed infections, 
which in some cases lead to recombination and increased viral 
diversity [4]. Geminiviruses are divided into multiple genera, of 
which Begomovirus and Mastrevirus are the most diverse within the 
family [5]. The Geminiviridae also includes Becurtovirus, Capula-
virus, Citlodavirus, Curtovirus, Eragrovirus, Grablovirus, Maldo-
virus, Mulcrilevirus, Opunvirus, Topilevirus, Topocuvirus, and 
Turncurtovirus [5]. 
One of the primary needs for virological studies is to be able to 
infect plants under controlled conditions so that the viruses can be

studied independently from other pathogens or stresses. Lately, the 
use of infectious clones has been more prevalent, but it is not the 
only way to inoculate viruses onto plants [6]. The most common 
method is mechanical inoculation, but very few geminiviruses can 
be mechanically transmitted. One can also inoculate plants by 
grafting, which is very efﬁcient for transmission but labor-intensive 
for implementation [7]. Another way is using the insect vector, 
which is also very efﬁcient. However, you need access to the insect, 
which requires special facilities and expertise for rearing and 
containment—both expensive and time-consuming investments. 
Viruses can also be transmitted through soil, nematodes, fungi, 
etc. [8], but these avenues have not been explored for gemini-
viruses. With advances in molecular biology, the use of cloned 
geminivirus genomes to generate infectious clones to infect plants 
has become popular due to its simplicity and efﬁciency. Infectious 
clones for geminiviruses are designed to include two copies of the 
viral origin of replication, which is recognized by the viral Rep 
protein (aka AL1 or C1) that catalyzes nicking and ligation to 
release the geminivirus circular genome.

Two major inoculation methods are commonly used in gemi-
nivirus studies—agroinoculation and biolistic inoculation. For 
agroinoculation, a hemi-dimer or a dimer of the viral genome is 
cloned into an Agrobacterium binary vector. Plants are inoculated 
with an Agrobacterium culture with an infectious clone, which is 
transferred into the plant cells. The viral genome in the T-DNA is 
transcribed to produce Rep, which then catalyzes the release of the 
viral genome to initiate viral infection [9]. Biolistic inoculation 
directly shoots cloned viral genomic DNA into the plant [10]. In 
this case, particle acceleration allows the cloned viral DNA precipi-
tated onto gold or tungsten particles to enter plant cells, where the 
viral genome is released, and the infection process starts. The 
plasmids used for biolistic inoculation have a similar design as 
agroinoculation clones, except that the vector can be propagated 
at high levels in E. coli. It is important to note that not all gemini-
viruses can be inoculated by biolistics, but most can be inoculated 
via agroinoculation. This may reﬂect that phloem-limited gemini-
virus is difﬁcult to inoculate via particle acceleration. 
Another derivation of these molecular biology advances is the 
use of naked DNA to inoculate geminiviruses directly, but this 
method is much lower in efﬁciency. Moreover, not all geminiviruses 
can be inoculated using naked DNA [11]. Rolling circle ampliﬁed 
DNA has also been used to inoculate plants [12]. In some 
instances, total DNA from geminivirus-infected plants can also be 
used for inoculations. This approach can result in the loss of some 
viruses in a mixed infection; e.g., tomato yellow leaf curl virus 
cannot be inoculated in this way. 
This protocol focuses on the inoculation of bipartite begomo-
viruses into Arabidopsis (Agrobacterium and biolistics) and cassava

(biolistics). Inoculation of begomoviruses with bipartite genomes 
requires two infectious clones, one for the A component and one 
for the B component, to achieve full infection. Inoculation of the A 
component clone alone can be used to examine viral replication 
separate from viral movement functions. The agrobacterium pro-
tocol can also be used to inoculate Arabidopsis with beet curly top 
virus or tomato yellow leaf curl virus, which have monopartite 
genomes [13]. Agroinoculation has not yet worked in our hands 
for cassava begomoviruses.

Materials 
2.1 
Agroinoculation 
in Arabidopsis 
thaliana Col-0 
1. Infectious clones in agrobacterium-compatible vectors trans-
formed into Agrobacterium tumefaciens (veriﬁcation of the 
compatibility of the vector with the agrobacterium strain is 
needed prior to transformation). 
2. Sterilized LB or YEB media to grow Agrobacterium, depend-
ing on availability and the needs of the Agrobacterium strain. 
3. Selected antibiotics for the bacterial strain used. (If using 
binary vectors, antibiotics are recommended for both the bac-
terial strain and the plasmids.) 
4. Culture tubes. 
5. Incubator (with shaker) at 28 °C or 30  °C. 
6. Insulin or 3-mL disposable syringes. 
7. Needles, preference for short and thin gauge (27G 1¼). Larger 
syringes and wider needle gauges may hurt the plant and 
decapitate the leaves. 
8. Plants at the proper stage for inoculation (Arabidopsis with 
14–16 true leaves in pots).

another producer) particles. 
2. Balance (capable of 60 mg weighting). 
3. Centrifuge (for microfuge tubes). 
4. Absolute ethanol (200 Proof).

ampliﬁcation products or total DNA from infected plants can 
also be used for this purpose, but not all viruses will be infec-
tious in this way. 
3. Sterilized Swinnex® ﬁlter holder (or equivalent), one per treat-
ment. (Millipore). 
4. Micropipettes and sterile tips. 
5. Sonicator (for instance jewelry sonicator or Fisher Ultrasonic 
Bath, 1.9 L). 
6. Vortex or shaker. 
7. Microdrop sprayer (Ascefran, LLC), low pressure or another 
biolistic device (Bio-Rad Helios Gene Gun System). 
8. Plants at the proper stage for inoculation. Arabidopsis: 
(We have inoculated many ecotypes with this method, and all 
have worked, with very few exceptions [14]). Plants are grown 
at 20 °C with 8 h of light. Arabidopsis can be inoculated from 
six true leaf stages all the way to ﬂowering if the inoculation is 
performed with a low-pressure device (less than 100 psi). For 
high-pressure inoculations (higher than 100 psi and up to 
900 psi), it is better to use older plants closer to the 16–18 
true leaves stage. Cassava: Propagated stem cuttings grown to a 
6–8 leaf stage of a susceptible cultivar or other cultivars/vari-
eties work well with this protocol. The plants can be grown 
between 28 °C and 30 °C with a light regime of a 12-h light/ 
dark cycle (Aimone et al., 2021).

Methods 
Methods 3.1 and 3.2 have been successfully used for beet curly top 
virus (BCTV) and tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) in addi-
tion to CabLCV in Arabidopsis. 
3.1 
Agroinoculation 
in Arabidopsis thaliana 
Plants (See Video S1) 
1. Use Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 with 16–18 true leaves (see 
Note 1), grown at 20 °C with 8 h of light. Trays containing 
18 9 cm2 (3.5 in2 ) pots allow the plant to expand the leaves so 
that symptoms are clear, and the plants grow well. Other con-
ﬁgurations should also work, but this size tray is recommended 
for optimal results. 
2. Grow 3–5 mL LB cultures of Agrobacterium carrying CabLCV 
A and B components at 30 °C overnight (O.D. should be at 
least 1.0 or to saturation). 
3. Mix an equal amount of each culture (1:1).

avoiding the central meristem. Deposit a droplet of culture in
each plant (see Note 2).

4. Keep the inoculated plants under a cover (lid) for at least 1 day; 
take the lid off after that. 
5. Observe the development of responses to the bacterial inocu-
lation. A yellowing will appear ~3 dpi, which is caused by the 
response to Agrobacterium; the plants will recover, and viral 
symptoms should appear later on. 
6. Observe and record the viral symptoms. Viral symptoms could 
start to appear at 9 dpi, and by 12–14 dpi, all plants should have 
full symptomatic tissue (see Note 3). 
3.2 
Other Plants Can 
Be Inoculated with 
This Method (See Note 
4) 
1. Grow the Agrobacterium cultures to saturation and mix 1:1, if 
bipartite. 
2. Using a 25-gauge syringe, inoculate the stem under the ﬂag 
leaf by puncturing it 5–10 times and leaving a droplet of the 
culture on it (see Note 5). 
3.3 
Low-Pressure 
Geminivirus 
Bombardment 
1. Weigh 60 mg of gold particles or tungsten particles. 
2. Add 2 mL of 99.5% ethanol (200 proof) and mix well in a 
vortex or shaker. 
3.3.1 
Stock Particle 
Preparation for Biolistics 
(Fig. 1) 
3. Centrifuge at 10,000 rpm for 2 min. 
4. Decant supernatant and eliminate it, making sure the particle 
pellet stays intact. 
5. Resuspend the gold pellet in 1 mL of deionized water (sterile). 
6. Sonicate for 10 min in a water bath sonicator and mix 
continuously. 
7. Prepare 250 μL aliquots and resuspend in 750 μL of sterile 
deionized water. Store aliquots at -20 °C. 
8. Use 50 μL aliquots for bombarding (see Note 6). 
3.3.2 
Geminivirus 
Bombardment (Low-
Pressure Microdrop 
Sprayer) (Fig. 2 and Video 
S2) 
1. Add 5 μg of DNA from each component (see Note 7) to gold 
particles while vortexing (50 μL of prepared gold particles). 
This will use 10 μg per every 50 μL aliquot of particles, which 
will bombard six plants. 
2. Add 50 μL CaCl2, 2.5 M, while agitating. 
3. Add 20 μL of 0.1 M spermidine, while agitating. 
4. Mix for 3–5 min by vortexing. 
5. Spin tubes at 10,000 rpm for 10 s. Remove and discard the 
supernatant. 
6. Add 250 μL of 200-proof ethanol (100%) and resuspend pel-
lets. Sonication may be required to resuspend; however, do not 
over-sonicate. This could cause breakage of the DNA.

Fig. 1 Preparation of the particle’s stocks. After weighing 60 mg of particles, absolute ethanol is added, 
followed by resuspension and short centrifugation at 10 K rpm. Once centrifuged, the supernatant is 
eliminated, and the pellet resuspended in 1 mL of water and then is placed in a bath sonicator for 10 min. 
After sonication and with the particles fully resuspended, 250 μL is transferred to a new tube, and 750 μL of  
water is added. While maintaining the particles resuspended, transfer 50 μL of the particle resuspension to a 
new microcentrifuge tube, where the particles can be used immediately or stored at -20 °C for long-term 
storage. (Figure created using BioRender.com) 
7. Spin tubes at 10,000 rpm for 10 s. Remove and discard the 
supernatant. 
8. Resuspend DNA pellets in 65 μL of 200-proof ethanol and 
keep the tubes on ice until use. 
9. Use 10 μL to add to the center of the Swinnex® ﬁlter, close it, 
and bombard it. Alternatively, a pipette and tip can be used to 
directly add the volume onto the Swinnex® ﬁlter without 
opening it (see Fig. 3 and Video S3).

Notes 
1. Younger plants can be inoculated, but the virus may kill them 
very quickly. Older plants can also be inoculated, but they are 
slightly more resistant to the infection, although eventually, 
they will be infected.

Begomovirus Inoculation
77
Fig. 2 Coating of the particles to be delivered with the DNA. (1) For 50 μL of particles, 5 μg of each DNA 
component (A and B for bipartite begomoviruses) is added (the volumes of this solution will vary depending on 
the concentration of the puriﬁed DNA). (2) 50 μL of CaCl2 and 20 μL of spermidine are added to the 
continuously moving particles with DNA. (3) The particles can be placed in a shaker or sonicated, but 
sonication must be very brief to avoid breakage of the DNA. (4) A short centrifugation at 10 K rpm is followed 
by eliminating the supernatant, by decanting, or micropipette (5). (6) 250 μL of absolute ethanol is added. 
(7) Another resuspension is required (use a sonicator, shaker, or vortex). Centrifugation at 10 K rpm followed 
by supernatant removal (8 and 9). The last removal must be performed very carefully. The last steps involve 
adding 65 μL of absolute ethanol (10) and resuspending the particles with the DNA (11). The particles are 
ready to be used for delivery. (Figure created using BioRender.com) 
2. The droplet can be deposited prior to poking. 
3. For BCTV, symptom appearance is delayed compared to 
CabLCV and shows only after 21 dpi. For TYLCV, the symp-
toms are really mild and show after 28 dpi. Growth conditions, 
including temperature, light quality, and intensity, signiﬁcantly 
affect symptom development. 
4. For species different than Arabidopsis, agroinoculation can be 
used; however, not all the viruses will infect all the hosts (this is 
known to be effective in Nicotiana benthamiana, Nicotiana 
tabacum, Nicandra physalodes, Datura stramonium, and Lyco-
persicon lycopersicon). Successful inoculation by biolistics has 
been observed with the following viruses: CabLCV, BCTV,

Fig. 3 Delivery of DNA-coated particles onto plants. From a fully resuspended particle suspension, remove 
10 μL of particles and deposit them in the mesh of the Swinnex® ﬁlter or equivalent, by using the oriﬁce at the 
top of the ﬁlter or unscrewing the top of the ﬁlter. Screw back the top if needed, and then screw the ﬁlter onto 
the mouth of the microdrop sprayer. Use your selected pressure for particle delivery; 120 psi is the 
recommended pressure for most applications. (Figure created using BioRender.com) 
TYLCV, ToMoV, TGMV, PepGMV, PHYVV, ACMV, and 
EACMV and even CBSV-Ug (Potyviridae). 
5. The best place to inoculate in this system is the stem, at the base 
of the upper leaf (younger). Other tissue may work; however, it 
will depend on the architecture of the plant and the ability to 
reach the phloem tissue easily. 
6. The ﬁnal concentration of particles will be 15 μg/μL. Store at
-20 °C. This procedure has been modiﬁed from Cabrera-
Ponce et al. 1997. 
7. 5 μg is good, but 2.5 μg of cloned DNA can also work. For 
Arabidopsis, a low amount of 100 ng per component has 
worked. However, for cassava, it is strongly suggested to keep 
it at 10 μg of total DNA (5 μg per component).

Absolute and Relative Quantiﬁcation of Single-Stranded 
Positive-Sense RNA Viruses from Plant Tissue 
Pinky Dutta and Kristiina M€akinen 
Abstract 
Reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) allows sensitive and speciﬁc measurement of mRNA 
transcripts from a given sample in a short period of time. Relative and absolute RT-qPCR are two strategies 
that could be used to quantify mRNA transcripts, based on the goal of the experiment. Here, we describe 
the protocol for the quantiﬁcation of plant viral RNA transcripts from an infected sample using both 
strategies. 
Key words Reverse transcription quantitative PCR, mRNA, Viral RNA, Relative gene expression,

Introduction 
Positive-sense plant RNA viruses play a prominent role in reducing 
crop yield and thus have a massive research interest [1, 2]. Since the 
prevention of viral disease incidence and spread is mainly dependent 
on preventive measures, early detection of infected plant materials is 
of utmost importance. Methods such as enzyme-linked immuno-
sorbent assay (ELISA), reverse transcription polymerase chain reac-
tion (RT-PCR), and reverse transcription quantitative PCR 
(RT-qPCR) are actively used for diagnosis and research purposes 
[3, 4]. With the advent of next-generation sequencing techniques, 
screening of several viruses can be done simultaneously; however, 
RT-qPCR remains a gold standard in the targeted detection of 
viruses [5]. 
RT-qPCR is a kinetic method and is based on the detection and 
quantiﬁcation of a ﬂuorescent reporter [6]. Fluorescent dye (e.g., 
SYBR Green), probes (e.g., TaqMan probe), and labeled oligonu-
cleotide primers are different types of ﬂuorescent reporters that are 
used in RT-qPCR [7]. SYBR green emits a ﬂuorescent signal upon 
intercalating nonspeciﬁcally between double-stranded DNA, which

is quantiﬁed by a quantitative PCR (qPCR) machine. Use of ﬂuo-
rescent probes provides higher speciﬁcity as intercalating dyes can 
bind and generate signal from non-speciﬁc products. RT-qPCR is a 
two-step process in which RNA molecules in a sample are reverse 
transcribed into complementary DNA (cDNA), which is further 
used as a template for qPCR. The assay is highly sensitive and 
speciﬁc, enabling detection and measurement from minute amount 
of nucleic acids allowing detection even from a single cell [8]. Apart 
from scrutinizing virus load and proliferation during pathogen 
infection, the assay is also used to study transcriptional changes in 
plants during different biotic and abiotic stress conditions [9–12].

Quantiﬁcation of viral load can be determined by two strategies 
of RT-qPCR: relative and absolute quantiﬁcation [13]. Relative 
gene expression analysis enables the quantiﬁcation of a gene of 
interest relative to a reference gene. Comparative CT (threshold 
cycle) method, also known as 2-ΔΔC 
T [14], is a widely used method 
to determine changes in expression of the gene of interest relative 
to a reference or a control gene. The 2-ΔΔC 
T method relies on 
similar PCR efﬁciency of the target and reference gene. When 
primers with different PCR efﬁciency are used, Pfafﬂ method 
should be used to calculate relative gene expression [15]. The Pfafﬂ 
method accounts for the differences in PCR efﬁciency of both the 
reference and the target genes while calculating the ratio of devia-
tion in threshold cycle of target gene over reference genes. Absolute 
expression of a gene of interest is quantiﬁed by calculating the copy 
number of a gene after transforming the data (CT value) via a 
standard curve [16]. A standard curve to be used for viral RNA 
quantiﬁcation can be constructed either using a known concentra-
tion of plasmid containing the viral genomic sequence or puriﬁed 
viral particles. 
Implementation of relative or absolute quantiﬁcation in a gene 
expression assay depends on the goal of the experiment. To ensure 
good experimental practice and generation of reliable and repro-
ducible data, the MIQE guidelines for standardization of qPCR 
experiments should be followed [17, 18]. It states the minimum 
requirements required for publication of RT-qPCR data. Appropri-
ate reference genes should be selected and validated for each exper-
iment [14, 17, 18] to ensure their expression remains unaffected 
due to the treatment, and it is recommended that a minimum of 
two reference genes should be used [17, 18]. 
Here, we describe both the relative and absolute quantiﬁcation 
of potato virus A RNA from Nicotiana benthamiana-infected 
plants. A layout of the RT-qPCR experimental design is in Fig. 1.

Methods 
3.1 
Initiation of PVA 
Infection in N. 
benthamiana via 
Agrobacterium-
Mediated Inﬁltration 
1. Revive Agrobacterium strain C58C1 harboring PVA and GUS 
control constructs from glycerol stock by streaking on a 
LB + agar medium and incubate at 28 °C for 2 days. 
2. Inoculate a single colony of each construct to 5 mL LB+ 
MACK and incubate on a shaker with 220 rpm at 28 °C 
overnight. 
3. Inoculate fresh LB+ MACK with the primary starter culture (1: 
100) and incubate at 28 °C for 4 h. 
4. Harvest bacterial cells by centrifuging at 5000g for 5 min at 
20 °C and wash once with MQ water and induction buffer, 
sequentially. 
5. Prepare an inﬁltration mix by adjusting bacterial OD600 to 0.3 
with induction buffer and incubate for 1 h at room temperature 
(see Note 6). 
6. Inject the inﬁltration mix into the abaxial side of two fully 
developed N. benthamiana leaves to initiate infection. Inocu-
late control plants with inﬁltration mix containing Agrobacter-
ium carrying the 35S-GUS construct. At least three biological 
replicates (three plants) are required per treatment (three treat-
ment and three control). 
7. Maintain the infected and control plants in the greenhouse 
(16 h–22 °C light/8 h–18 °C dark cycle). 
3.2 
Total RNA 
Extraction 
1. Collect leaf tissue (~100 mg) from inoculated leaves using a 
cork borer 3 days post-inoculation (dpi) and snap freeze in 
liquid nitrogen (see Note 7). Leaf tissue from an individual 
plant is collected into a single tube. Samples from multiple 
plants should not be pooled. 
2. Pulverize leaf tissues in a cryo-mill with six 2-mm steel beads or 
a pre-cooled mortar pestle with liquid nitrogen (see Note 8).

3. Add 750 μL of TRIzol to each sample, invert the tube to mix, 
and incubate for 5 min at RT. 
4. Add 150 μL of chloroform, mix thoroughly, and incubate for 
3 min at RT. 
5. Centrifuge the sample at 12,000g at 4 °C for 15 min to separate 
the sample into three distinct phases. 
6. Transfer the upper aqueous phase to a separate microcentrifuge 
tube and add 500 μL of 100% isopropanol and incubate for 
10 min at 4 °C. 
7. Centrifuge at 12,000g at 4 °C for 10 min to precipitate 
the RNA. 
8. Remove the supernatant and add 500 μL of cold 70% ethanol. 
9. Centrifuge at 7500g at 4 °C for 5 min and discard the 
supernatant. 
10. Air dry the RNA pellet for 5 min and resuspend in 25 μL of  
nuclease-free water. 
11. Measure RNA concentration using Qubit or NanoDrop. 
3.3 
Removal of 
Contaminating DNA 
1. Perform DNase treatment with RQ1 DNase (Promega) or a 
similar product, on 1 μg of total RNA to get rid of 
contaminating DNA. 
2. Incubate the samples at 37 °C for 30 min. 
3. Heat-inactivate DNase by adding DNase stop solution and 
incubating at 65 °C for 10 min. DNase stop solution comes 
along with RQ1 DNase. 
3.4 
Reverse 
Transcription of Total 
RNA 
To generate a DNA template compatible for a two-step RT-qPCR, 
RNA is reverse-transcribed to cDNA using reverse transcriptase. 
1. Run 300 ng of DNase-treated RNA on an 1% agarose gel in 1× 
TBE buffer to check RNA integrity prior to reverse transcrip-
tion (see Note 9). 
2. For a 20 μL PVA cDNA synthesis mix, add 
0.2 μg/mL of 
random primers (1 μL) to 500 ng of DNase-treated RNA, to 
yield a total volume of 12 μL (see Note 10). 
3. Incubate the samples at 65 °C for 5 min to get rid of RNA 
secondary structures. 
4. Chill on ice and add RT mix containing 4 μL of 5× reaction 
buffer, 1 μL (20 U) of RiboLock RNase inhibitor, 1 μL 
(200 U) of reverse transcriptase, and 2 μL (1 mM) dNTP mix 
(see Note 11). 
5. A negative control to check for genomic DNA contamination is 
included by omitting the reverse transcriptase (RT minus), 
while

contamination of reagents (non-template control). These reac-
tions are done in the same way as the actual test reactions in 
steps 2–4, but to reach a volume of 20 μL, the missing volume 
of omitted RT and template RNA is supplemented with 
nuclease-free water. 
3.5 
Relative 
Quantiﬁcation RT-
qPCR 
Multiple reference genes must be used for normalization of qPCR 
assay, and these genes must be validated for each experiment sepa-
rately [17, 18]. 
1. qPCRs are performed in triplicate per cDNA sample. 
2. Three different master mixes are to be prepared: one each for 
virus-speciﬁc primers and two reference genes. 
3. To make a qPCR master mix of 9 μL, add 5 μL of  2× SYBR 
green qPCR mix, 500 μM (0.5 μL) each of forward and reverse 
primer, and 3 μL of nuclease-free water. 
4. Add the master mix into a 96 or 384-well plate and add 1 μL of  
cDNA into each well (see Note 12). 
5. Cover and seal the plate with a clear optical adhesive ﬁlm. 
6. The qPCR plate is brieﬂy centrifuged (~10 s at 1000 rpm). 
7. Amplify the samples in a real-time PCR machine by subjecting 
it to a single cycle of initial denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s and 
subsequently 39 cycles each of denaturation at 95 °C for 10 s, 
annealing at 59 °C for 30 s, extension at 72 °C for 30 s. 
8. Generate a melt curve by heating from 60 °C to 95  °C i  
increments of 0.5 °C/s programmed together with the 
RT-qPCR run (see Note 13). 
3.6 
Absolute 
Quantiﬁcation 
The general procedure followed for absolute quantiﬁcation is simi-
lar to relative quantiﬁcation. However, to determine the exact copy 
number of a gene in a sample, the inclusion of a linear standard 
curve in the qPCR run is necessary.

2. To prepare a standard of the range 108 –10 molecules/μL, 
make a serial dilution of PVA plasmid. Mix 10 μL of PV  
plasmid with 90 μL of nuclease-free water, vortex, and centri-
fuge it brieﬂy. Repeat the steps until 10 PVA plasmids/μL are 
obtained (see Note 14).

Data Analysis for 
Relative Gene 
Expression 
Different methods of calculating relative gene expression exist. 
When the primer efﬁciency is equal, relative gene expression is 
calculated using the 2–ΔΔC 
T method [14], while the Pfafﬂ method 
[15] should be used when the differences in primer efﬁciencies 
exist. 
1. Calculate the PCR efﬁciency of primer pairs, by generating a 
linear standard curve of the primers. The linear regression 
results in the equation of a line with the general form: 
y = mx + c, where m is the slope of the line and c is the y-
intercept. 
where 
E = 10–1/m . 
The qPCR run information can be exported to Microsoft 
Excel spreadsheet. The data contain CT, values of the samples, 
which can be ﬁt into an equation to determine gene expression 
as fold change. 
2. Comparative CT method 
where 
ΔCT (infected sample) = CT (viral coat protein gene in the 
infected sample) – CT (reference gene in the infected 
sample). 
ΔCT (healthy sample) = CT (viral coat protein gene in the 
healthy sample) – CT (reference gene in the healthy 
sample).

E = PCR efﬁciency. 
3.8 
Data Analysis for 
Absolute 
Quantiﬁcation 
The reliability of the results obtained in absolute quantiﬁcation 
depends on the accuracy of the standard curve. Absolute counts 
of a gene copy are calculated by plotting the CT value of the sample 
to the standard curve and extrapolating a value. 
The qPCR machine calculates and returns the copy number of 
the genes in the infected and healthy samples based on the standard 
curve included in the run. 
Student’s t-test is performed to determine if the difference in 
relative/absolute quantiﬁcation between the infected and the con-
trol samples is statistically signiﬁcant.

Notes 
1. Both the viral and control constructs were transformed into 
Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain C58C1 containing the vir 
gene expression helper plasmid pGV2260. 
2. Prepare Luria–Bertani (LB) medium by dissolving 10 g tryp-
tone, 5 g yeast extract, and 5 g NaCl in 1000 mL of nuclease-
free water and autoclave. Prepare 0.5 M MES by dissolving 
97.62 g MES in 750 mL MQ water, adjust the pH to 6.7 with 
10 N NaOH, and make up the volume to 1000 mL with MQ 
water. Autoclave and store at 4 °C. Prepare 100 mM AS by 
dissolving 490 mg AS in 25 mL dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), 
make 100 μL aliquots, and store at -20 °C. Carbenicillin 
(10 mg/mL) and kanamycin (10 mg/mL) stock solution of 
100 mL is prepared by dissolving 1 g of the required antibiotic 
in 100 mL MQ water and sterile ﬁltered through a 0.2-mm 
ﬁlter and stored at -20 °C. 
3. To prepare LB+ agar plates dissolve 9 g tryptone, 4.5 g yeast 
extract, 13.5 g agar, and 4.5 g NaCl in 900 mL of nuclease-free 
water, boil and autoclave, and store at 4 °C. 
4. Dissolve 203.3 g MgCl2 · 6H2O in 1000 mL MQ water to 
obtain 1 M MgCl2 stock solution, autoclave, and store this 
stock solution at room temperature. 
5. Prepare 10× TBE stock solution by dissolving 121.1 g of Tris 
base, 61.83 g of boric acid, and 7.44 g EDTA in 1000 mL 
nuclease-free water, autoclave, and store at room temperature. 
6. Bacterial OD600 can be adjusted according to experimental

7. Date of sample collection can be determined based on experi-
mental design. 
8. It is essential to retain the integrity of viral RNA, and hence, the 
samples should be kept frozen during pulverization until TRI-
zol is added. Addition of TRIzol stabilizes the RNA, maintain-
ing RNA integrity. 
9. Sharp ribosomal RNA bands indicate that RNA is still intact, 
while any smearing indicates degradation. 
10. Depending on the utility of the synthesized cDNA, the primer 
type is to be chosen. Random hexamers synthesize cDNA by 
binding to random sites on the total RNA population (viral 
RNA, rRNA, and plant mRNA). Usage of oligo-dT primers 
selectively enriches cDNA for poly-A containing viral and plant 
mRNAs, as it binds to the poly-A tail of mRNA, while gene-
speciﬁc primers enrich the cDNA pool for the gene of interest. 
11. These reagents come with the cDNA synthesis kit. 
12. Using a pipetting robot/liquid handler to pipette reagents 
helps to limit pipetting errors and human fatigue. If a pipetting 
robot is not available, the use of a multichannel pipette is 
advisable. 
13. A melt curve analysis enables the determination of the speciﬁc-
ity of qPCR product formed. A single peak indicates ampliﬁca-
tion of a single PCR product, hence highly speciﬁc. 
14. A standard can also be prepared using puriﬁed viral particles.

Quantiﬁcation of Virion-Sense and Complementary-Sense 
DNA Strands of Circular Single-Stranded DNA Viruses 
Edgar A. Rodrı´guez-Negrete and Ana Grande-Pe´rez 
Abstract 
Circular ssDNA viruses are ubiquitous and can be found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. To under-
stand the interaction of ssDNA viruses with their hosts, it is important to characterize the dynamics of viral 
sense (VS) and complementary-sense (CS) viral strands during the infection process. Here, we present a 
simple and rapid protocol that allows sensitive and accurate determination of the VS and CS strands 
generated during viral infection. 
The method consists of a two-step qPCR in which the ﬁrst step uses a strand-speciﬁc (CS or VS) labeled 
primer and T4 DNA polymerase that lacks strand displacement activity and makes a single copy per VS or 
CS strand. Next, the T4 DNA polymerase and unincorporated oligonucleotides are removed by a silica 
membrane spin column. Finally, the puriﬁed VS or CS strands are quantiﬁed by qPCR in a second step in 
which ampliﬁcation uses a tag primer and a speciﬁc primer. Absolute quantiﬁcation of VS and CS strands is 
obtained by extrapolating the Cq data to a standard curve of ssDNA, which can be generated by phagemid 
expression. Quantiﬁcation of VS and CS strands of two geminiviruses in infections of Solanum lycopersicum 
(tomato) and Nicotiana benthamiana plants using this method is shown.

Introduction 
Circular single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) viruses are a very abundant 
and ubiquitous group of viruses [1, 2] that are receiving increasing 
interest in recent years due to the discoveries of metagenomics [3– 
15] and meta-transcriptomics [16, 17]. Bacteria, archaea, and 
eukaryotes can be infected by circular ssDNA viruses [18, 19]. How-
ever, only those transmitted by arthropods that infect plants are 
pathogenic and cause serious losses to agriculture-based economies 
[20]. In addition, circular ssDNA viruses are endowed with high 
mutation and recombination rates, making them an important 
group of emerging viruses with enormous evolutionary potential 
[21–27].

The method consists of a simple and rapid two-step qPCR in
which the ﬁrst step uses a tagged strand-speciﬁc primer and T4
DNA polymerase to copy the CS or the VS strand. T4 DNA
polymerase lacks strand displacement activity, and when it performs
the complete circular DNA copy, it cannot proceed beyond the 5′
end of the extended primer. Therefore, only one copy is generated
per VS or CS strand. Next, the DNA polymerase and unincorpo-
rated oligonucleotides are removed using a silica membrane spin

A growing list of circular ssDNA viruses is classiﬁed into 
21 families. Prokaryotic viruses that infect bacteria are found in 
the Inoviridae, Paulinoviridae, Plectoviridae, Microviridae, and 
Finnlakeviridae 
families 
[28–30], 
whereas 
archaeal 
circular 
ssDNA viruses are classiﬁed in the Pleolipoviridae and Spiraviridae 
families [31, 32]. Eukaryotic circular ssDNA viruses belong to the 
families Bacilladnaviridae, which infect only diatoms; Smacoviri-
dae, found in vertebrates and insect feces [33]; Anelloviridae and 
Circoviridae, which infect higher vertebrates [34, 35]; Genomovir-
idae, which groups fungal viruses and a series of viruses associated 
with vertebrate feces and insects [36]; Redondoviridae, identiﬁed 
from human samples [37]; the three new families, Naryaviridae, 
Nenyaviridae, and Vilyaviridae, of circular ssDNA viruses asso-
ciated with protozoan parasites belonging to the genera Entamoeba 
and Giardia [38]; and ﬁnally, the circular ssDNA plant–virus 
families, which are the recently added Metaxyviridae family, and 
the Geminiviridae and Nanoviridae families, plus their associated 
circular ssDNA satellites, classiﬁed in the Alphasatellitidae and 
Tolecusatellitidae families [39–41]. Most viruses with a circular 
ssDNA genome encode the replication-associated protein Rep 
and replicate by a rolling circle replication (RCR) mechanism 
[42, 43]. All eukaryotic circular ssDNA viruses have been grouped 
into the so-called CRESS DNA viruses, i.e., circular Rep encoding 
single-stranded DNA viruses [44, 45]. They replicate in the nucleus 
after the VS (virion-sense) strand, which is the encapsidated strand, 
is transformed into a dsDNA replicative intermediate, or covalently 
closed replicative form (RF), by host DNA polymerases [42]. Then, 
the Rep protein cleavages the RF to start the RCR that will produce 
VS copies that will be recircularized and encapsidated into progeny 
virions or will enter a new RCR cycle. Expression of ORFs may 
occur from the VS or from the complementary-sense (CS) 
strands [46]. 
To understand the mechanisms involved in virus–host interac-
tion, characterization of viral strand accumulation during the infec-
tion process is essential. Although some qPCR methods exist to 
quantify circular ssDNA viruses [47–54], they do not discern the 
type (VS or CS) of viral molecules. The protocol presented here 
allows sensitive and accurate determination of the VS and CS 
strands generated during viral infection and thus enables detailed 
analysis of the infection process of circular ssDNA viruses.

column. Finally, the puriﬁed VS or CS strands are quantiﬁed by
qPCR in a second step in which ampliﬁcation uses a tag primer and
a speciﬁc primer. Absolute quantiﬁcation of VS and CS strands is
obtained by extrapolating the Cq data to a standard curve consist-
ing of serial dilutions containing between 107 and 103 molecules of
ssDNA (which can be generated by phagemid expression) or circu-
lar dsDNA.
Strand-Speciﬁc Quantiﬁcation of Circular ssDNA Viruses

This protocol has been used to quantify sensitively and accu-
rately the VS and CS strands of two geminiviruses in infections of 
Solanum lycopersicum (tomato) and Nicotiana benthamiana plants. 
It revealed differences in VS/CS ratios between viruses in both 
hosts and determined that the majority of CS molecules were 
found in dsDNA intermediates [55].

Methods 
3.1 
Synthesis of 
Single-Stranded DNA 
Standards 
To obtain single-stranded circular molecules, Escherichia coli F′
strain is ﬁrst transformed with tomato TYLCSV or TYLCV full-
length genome monomeric constructs (pBTSvs and pBTScs for 
TYLCSV, and pBTYMvs and pBTYMcs for TYLCV, inserted in 
pBSK II (-) phagemid, in virion sense (VS) and complementary 
sense (CS) relative to f1 phage origin, respectively, using standard 
chemical or electroporation transformation methods and then 
infected with M13KO7 bacteriophage helper virus according to 
the next protocol. 
1. Inoculate 1.5 mL of TYP media containing 100 μg/mL ampi-
cillin with a fresh colony containing the monomeric viral con-
struct (VS or CS) and 1.5 μL of M13KO7 helper virus 
suspension 1010 pfu/mL (ﬁnal concentration 107 pfu/mL) 
and grow with shaking at 225 rpm and 37 °C in an orbital 
shaker for 60 min. 
2. Then, add 1.5 μL of 70 mg/mL kanamycin stock solution 
(ﬁnal concentration 70 μg/mL) and grow for a further 
14–18 h at 225 rpm and 37 °C in an orbital shaker. 
3. Centrifuge each culture at 13,000 rpm for 10 min, transfer the 
supernatant to a new tube, and add 200 μL of 20% PEG 
solution and mix gently. 
4. Centrifuge the mixture at 13,000 rpm for 10 min, discard the 
supernatant, air dry the pellet, and resuspend in 300 μL of  TE  
buffer. 
5. Add 300 μL of 1:1 phenol:chloroform solution, mix vigorously 
by vortexing, centrifuge the mixture at 13,000 rpm for 10 min, 
and carefully transfer the upper aqueous phase to a new tube. 
Repeat step 5. 
6. Add to the aqueous phase (300 μL) 30 μL of 5 M Na-
CH3COOH and 700 μL of absolute ethanol, mix gently by 
inversion, and centrifuge the mixture at 13,000 rpm for 10 min 
to precipitate the DNA. 
7. Discard the supernatant, wash the pellet with 1 mL of 70% 
ethanol, centrifuge the mixture at 13,000 rpm for 5 min, dis-
card the supernatant, air dry the pellet, and resuspend in 20 μL 
of nuclease-free deionized H2O.

8. Assess the integrity of the single-stranded circular molecules 
containing the VS and the CS strands by 1% agarose gel 
electrophoresis. 
9. In parallel, evaluate the purity and yield of the single-stranded 
circular molecules by spectrophotometric assay according to 
the A260/A280 ratio (see Note 22). 
10. Determine the number of VS or CS molecules from the mass of 
the single-stranded circular viral standards using the following 
formula: 
DNA copy number = moles of ssDNA × Avogadros number 
where 
ss 
moles of ssDNA = mass of ssDNA (g)/molecular weight of 
ssDNA (g/mol). 
molecular weight of ssDNA = number of deoxynucleotide 
monophosphates of ssDNA × average of molecular weight 
of deoxynucleotide monophosphates (308.97 g/mol). 
To determine the number of double-stranded circular viral 
standard molecules, the average molecular weight of a 
base pair = 617.96 g/mol is used to calculate moles of 
dsDNA (see Note 23). 
3.2 
Systemic TYLCSV 
Infections of Nicotiana 
benthamiana and 
Tomato 
For inoculation of TYLCSV or TYLCV in N. benthamiana and 
S. lycopersicum plants, A. tumefaciens GV3101 strain harboring 
viral partial dimeric tandem repeat constructs are used (see Note 
24). As mock inoculation control, A. tumefaciens GV3101 strain 
harboring binary empty vector is used. 
1. A. tumefaciens GV3101 strains containing the viral clones and 
the empty binary vector are refreshed in LB solid medium 
supplemented with 100 μg/mL rifampicin, 5 μg/mL tetracy-
cline, and 50 μg/mL kanamycin (ﬁnal concentration), incubat-
ing the petri dishes for 3 days at 28 °C. 
2. An individual colony of each strain is pricked with a sterile 
toothpick and inoculated into 50 mL of LB liquid medium 
supplemented with 100 μg/mL rifampicin, 5 μg/mL tetracy-
cline, and 50 μg/mL kanamycin (ﬁnal concentration) and 
incubated overnight at 28 °C with vigorous shaking. 
3. A bacterial pellet is obtained by centrifugation at 4500 rpm for 
15 min, the supernatant is discarded, and the pellet resus-
pended in inﬁltration solution (10 mM MES pH 5.6, 10 mM 
MgCl2, 100 μM acetosyringone) to OD600 = 1.0, and the 
suspension incubated at room temperature overnight in 
the dark.

4. For 
N. 
benthamiana 
plants 
(3 
plants), 
1 
mL 
of 
the 
corresponding suspension is inﬁltrated in two totally expanded 
leaves in the abaxial zone using a 1-mL syringe without a 
needle. For S. lycopersicum plants (three plants), the same pro-
cedure is performed on two fully expanded leaves, and in 
addition, 1 mL of suspension is injected directly into the axil-
lary shoot using a 1-mL syringe with a needle. 
5. Plants are maintained for 4 days in a bioclimatic chamber at 
24 °C under long-day conditions (16/8 light/dark) and then 
transferred to the greenhouse. 
6. Uninoculated new apical leaf samples are collected from groups 
of three plants at 7, 14, 28, and 42 days post-inoculation (dpi), 
and tissue is used for total DNA extraction using the CTAB-
based method. Equal amounts of extracted DNA (1 μg) col-
lected at each time point from the three samples are pooled, 
and 200 ng of the mixture is analyzed by standard or two-step 
qPCR protocols. 
3.3 
Absolute 
Quantiﬁcation of VS 
and CS Strands by 
Two-Step qPCR 
We have developed a protocol for sensitive and reliable quantiﬁca-
tion of virion-sense (VS) and complementary-sense (CS) strands 
generated during viral infection, allowing detailed analysis of the 
infection process of circular ssDNA viruses, including the mono-
partite begomoviruses (Family Geminiviridae) TYLCSV and 
TYLCV. The method consists of a simple and rapid two-step 
qPCR in which the ﬁrst step uses a tagged strand-speciﬁc primer 
and T4 DNA polymerase (which lacks strand displacement activity) 
to copy the CS or VS strand. Unincorporated oligonucleotides are 
then removed using a silica membrane spin column. Finally, the 
puriﬁed VS or CS strands are quantiﬁed by qPCR in a second step 
in which ampliﬁcation takes place using a tag primer and a speciﬁc 
primer. In addition, the total amount of viral DNA (VS + CS) is 
quantiﬁed using viral-speciﬁc primers (Fig. 1). Absolute quantiﬁca-
tion of VS, CS, and total viral DNA strands is obtained by sub-
stituting the Cq data into the y-value of the equation of the 
corresponding standard curve regression plot in a dynamic range 
from 107 to 103 viral molecules. 
1. Prepare single-stranded (VS or CS) and double-stranded 
(VS + CS) viral DNA standards by mixing 10 μL of 108 mole-
cules/μL stock with 90 μL of ultrapure H2O to obtain the 
corresponding 107 molecules/μL dilution. Mix by vortex and 
perform a short spin. Repeat the serial dilution procedure until 
103 viral molecules/μL are obtained. 
2. For tagging single-stranded standards in the ﬁrst step, mix 1 μL 
of 1μM TAG-VS or TAG-CS primers (for labeling of VS or CS 
standards, respectively), 1 μL of dNTPs mix at 1.7 mM of each 
nucleotide, 1 μL of T4 DNA Pol 10× buffer, 1 μL of the

corresponding single-stranded standard (concentration from
108 to 104), and 5 μL of ultrapure H2O.

Fig. 1 Outline of the protocol for strand-speciﬁc quantiﬁcation. Two-step quantitative PCR (qPCR) procedure 
for quantiﬁcation of viral sense (VS) and complementary-sense (CS) DNA molecules. In the ﬁrst step, a T4 DNA 
polymerase extension of (a) the VS strand using the OCS-TAG primer or of (b) the CS strand using the OVS-TAG 
primer is performed. Subsequently, qPCR ampliﬁcation is carried out to quantify (a) the VS strand using 
primers TAG and OVS or (b) the CS strand using primers TAG and OCS. In both cases, the primers used for T4 
polymerase extension are removed prior to qPCR using a silica column that allows recovery of DNA molecules 
larger than 100 bp and smaller than 10 kb. (c) Standard qPCR to quantify both the VS and CS strands using the 
OVS and OCS primers. (Created with BioRender.com) 
3. The reaction mixes are denatured at 95 °C for 10 min, cooled 
to room temperature, and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min with 
1 unit T4 DNA polymerase (1 unit/μL). 
4. Unincorporated oligonucleotides are removed using silica 
membrane spin columns (inclusion range 100 bp–10 kb), 
according to manufacturer’s instructions, and the DNA is 
eluted in 50 μL of ultrapure H2O. 
5. For the second step of the qPCR procedure, 2 μL of the single-
stranded tagging reactions or double-stranded standards are 
mixed with 10 μL of SYBR Green or Eva Green Master mix 
2×,  1  μL of the corresponding 10 μM primer set (TAG + CS 
primers, or TAG + VS primers, or CS + VS primers, for quanti-
ﬁcation of VS, CS, or total viral strands, respectively), and 6 μL 
of ultrapure H2O. Each standard dilution is analyzed by three 
technical replicates.

1 × 103 to 1 × 107 copies of tomato yellow leaf curl Sardinia virus (TYLCSV) or tomato yellow leaf curl virus 
(TYLCV) circular single-stranded (VS- or CS-speciﬁc) or double-stranded (total viral DNA) DNA phagemids are 
used as quantiﬁcation standards. Quantiﬁcation is performed according to the methods described in Fig. 1. 
Data represent the average of three independent qPCR replicates. (b) Correlation coefﬁcients, qPCR efﬁciency

6. For qPCR, samples are subjected to one cycle at 95 °C for 30 s, 
40 cycles at 95 °C for 10 s, and 60 °C for 15 s (see Note 25). 
Melting curves are obtained after a ﬁnal step of 60 cycles of 10 s 
per cycle under a ramp rate of 0.5 °C every 10 s from 60 to 90 ° 
C (see Note 26). 
7. Standard curves for absolute quantiﬁcation are obtained by 
linear regression analysis of the quantiﬁcation cycle value (Cq) 
of each of the three technical replicates on the Log10 of DNA 
concentration (Fig. 2a). The linear regression results in the 
equation of a line with the general form: y = mx + c, where m 
is the slope of the line and c is the y-intercept. The efﬁciency (E) 
of qPCR is calculated as follows: E = 10–1/m , and the percent 
efﬁciency % E = (E - 1) × 100 (Fig. 2b) (see Note 27). 
8. For time-course analysis of TYLCSV or TYLCV infections, 
equal amounts of extracted DNA (1 μg) from three samples 
collected at each time point are pooled, and the mixture is 
analyzed by two-step qPCR or standard qPCR to quantify 
strand-speciﬁc or total viral DNA molecules, respectively. 
9. Two μL of DNA extracts (100 ng/μL) from infected 
N. benthamiana and S. lycopersicum plants are used for the 
ﬁrst step, single-strand (VS or CS) tagging, following the pro-
cedure described above (steps 2–4), and the tagged DNA is

For VS quantiﬁcation: VS copy number (Log10) = (Cq -
41.10)/(-3.45).
For TYLCV:

(10 
ng/μL,

10. For ssDNA quantiﬁcation, 2 μL (20 ng) of VS- or CS-tagged 
products is used, whereas for dsDNA quantiﬁcation, 2 μL of  
unlabeled total DNA extracts (10 ng/μL) is used according to 
the qPCR protocol described above (steps 5 and 6). In addi-
tion, as a reference control for data normalization, the 25 S 
rRNA amplicon of each sample is ampliﬁed using 2 μL of the 
corresponding template using the same qPCR protocol. 
11. Cq data obtained from VS, CS, or total viral DNA are normal-
ized by subtracting the ΔCq data of the corresponding 25S 
rRNA ampliﬁcation. 
12. Quantiﬁcation of ssDNA (VS or CS) and dsDNA is obtained 
by 
extrapolation 
of 
the 
normalized 
Cq 
data 
with 
the 
corresponding standard curve. 
For TYLCSV: 
For CS quantiﬁcation: CS copy number (Log10) = (Cq -
41.242)/(-3.3437). 
For total viral DNA quantiﬁcation: total viral DNA copy num-
ber (Log10) = (Cq - 37.30)/(-3.3829). 
For CS quantiﬁcation: CS copy number (Log10) = (Cq -
43.55)/(-3.4021). 
For total viral DNA quantiﬁcation: total viral DNA copy num-
ber (Log10) = (Cq - 37.22)/(-3.333). 
13. The resulting quantiﬁcation data are plotted against the 
corresponding sampling time and expressed as Log10 of the 
copy number of viral DNA strands (Fig. 3).

Notes 
1. In the presence of a phagemid bearing f1 origin, the single-
stranded DNA of the phagemid is packaged preferentially and 
secreted into the culture medium. This allows easy and efﬁcient 
production of single-stranded DNA qPCR standards. For total 
viral DNA quantiﬁcation, the plasmid constructs pBTSvs and 
pBTYMvs, containing double-stranded TYLCSV and TYLCV 
full-length genomes, respectively, are used as standard.

binary vector pGreen 0029 transformed in A. tumefaciens 
strain GV3101. 
13. To prepare LB media, combine 10 gr tryptone, 5 gr yeast 
extract, 10 gr NaCl, adjust pH to 7.0 with 1 N NaOH, and 
add 20 gr agar (for solid media only). Make up to 1 L with 
distilled water, autoclave in a glass storage bottle, and store at 
room temperature. 
14. To prepare stock solutions of rifampicin 100 mg/mL, tetracy-
cline 5 mg/mL, and kanamycin 100 mg/mL, dissolve 1 gr of 
sodium ampicillin, 50 mg of tetracycline hydrochloride, or 1 gr

of kanamycin monosulfate, in sufﬁcient dimethyl sulfoxide 
(DMSO), absolute ethanol, or deionized water, respectively, 
to make a ﬁnal volume of 10 mL in a 15-mL conical centrifuge 
tube. Sterilization is possible only for kanamycin solution by 
using 0.22-μm pore ﬁlters. DMSO and alcohol cause damage 
to ﬁlters, and sterilization of these solutions is not necessary. 
Aliquot and store at -20 °C. 
15. To prepare 100 mL of inﬁltration solution, mix 1 mL of 1 M 
2-(N-Morpholino) ethanesulfonic acid sodium salt (MES), 
pH 5.6, 1 mL of 1 M MgCl2, 100 μL of 1 M 3′, 5′-
-dimethoxy-4′-hydroxyacetophenone (acetosyringone), in suf-
ﬁcient deionized water to make a ﬁnal volume of 100 mL in a 
graduated cylinder. Make the inﬁltration solution just prior 
to use. 
16. To prepare 20 mL of 2× CTAB extraction buffer, mix in a 
15-mL conical centrifuge tube, 0.4 gr of CTAB, 2 mL of 1 M 
Tris–HCl pH 8.0, and 800 μL of 0.5 M EDTA pH 8.0. Make 
CTAB buffer just before extraction. It can be stored at room 
temperature for several days. 
17. For DNA labeling primer design, TAG is a 20-nt sequence 
from the mammalian lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. 
TYLCSV and TYLCV VS and CS primer sequences were 
designed 
against 
conserved 
regions 
of 
old-world 
(OW) begomovirus CP ORFs using the Primer Blast tool 
(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/primer-blast/). 
18. For strand-speciﬁc ampliﬁcation of TYLCSV and TYLCV 
strands, the combination of the primers TAG+VS or TAG 
+CS is required to detect VS and CS strands, respectively, 
using the corresponding labeled strand-speciﬁc template. For 
total viral DNA ampliﬁcation, the combination of VS+CS pri-
mers is necessary, using the unlabeled viral dsDNA as template. 
19. The tomato 25S nuclear ribosomal RNA gene (25S rRNA) 
(Accession Number X13557), highly conserved in the Solana-
ceae family, is used as a reference for qPCR normalization. 
20. T4 DNA polymerase catalyzes DNA synthesis in the 5′–3′
direction in the presence of a template and primer. T4 DNA 
polymerase lacks 5′–3′ exonuclease and strand displacement 
activities, allowing single copying of a full-length circular 
DNA template. 
21. After circular DNA labeling, a clean-up step is necessary to 
completely remove enzymes, salts, and primers. For this, it is 
important to use a silica-based spin column that only allows 
DNA fragments in the range of 100 bp–10 kb to be recovered. 
22. Photometric quantiﬁcation of DNA is based on the intrinsic 
absorption properties of nucleic acids. DNA absorbs at

106

260 nm, whereas contaminants, including phenolic com-
pounds and proteins, absorb at 280 nm. The ratio of the read-
ings at 260 nm and 280 nm (A260/A280) provides an estimate 
of DNA purity (pure DNA has an A260/A280 ratio of 1.7–1.9). 
On the other hand, the DNA concentration is determined by 
measuring the absorbance at 260 nm (A260) according to Beer– 
Lambert’s law (an absorbance of 1 unit at 260 nm corresponds 
to 50 μg DNA per mL). 
23. Alternatively, the number of molecules from the mass of 
ssDNA and dsDNA circular viral standards can be determined 
using the free online program http://cels.uri.edu/gsc/cndna.

24. Infectious clones of geminiviruses require more than one unit 
of the genome to produce a tandem repeat-containing two 
replication origins to achieve high infectivity rates. Partial 
dimeric constructs derived from geminiviruses (i.e., containing 
1.n-mer of the viral genome such that they fulﬁll the necessary 
condition of the presence of two viral replication origins for 
effective Agrobacterium-guided artiﬁcial infection) are cloned 
into binary vectors and introduced into A. tumefaciens strains 
that enable the process of viral infection of the plant host. 
25. For qPCR protocol, since a small amplicon of 188 bp is 
expected, a two-step protocol involving denaturation and 
annealing/synthesis is used. 
26. A single peak produced in the melting curve analysis indicates a 
speciﬁc ampliﬁcation product without PCR artifacts. 
27. Linear regression of qPCR data and efﬁciency determination 
can be obtained from standard qPCR apparatus software or 
calculated manually with Microsoft Excel software.

Replication Assay of Begomovirus in Arabidopsis 
Protoplasts 
Laura Gonc¸alves Costa Martins and Elizabeth P. B. Fontes 
Abstract 
Protoplasts are isolated plant cells from which the cell walls have been removed by treatment with fungal 
cellulase and macerozyme enzymes, which degrade the primary components of the cell wall. The proto-
plasts are totipotent, sensitive, and versatile; thereby, they have been extensively used to study signal 
transduction pathways, cell-autonomous responses, and replication of plant viruses. This system has several 
advantages over the use of whole plants for viral replication, including a high percentage of infected cells 
and uncoupling virus movement from replication assays. Here, we describe a simple and efﬁcient protocol 
for begomovirus transfection and replication in Arabidopsis protoplasts. The method consists of four steps, 
(i) protoplast isolation, (ii) PEG–calcium transfection of begomovirus infectious clones, (iii) elimination of 
input plasmid DNA by DpnI digestion, and (iv) quantiﬁcation of the viral newly synthesized DNA by 
qPCR. The protoplasts can be transformed efﬁciently with begomovirus infectious clones, and virus 
replication can be monitored by the accumulation of nascent viral DNA in the infected protoplasts.

Introduction 
Protoplasts are isolated plant cells that have had their cell walls 
removed enzymatically. The versatility of protoplasts has been 
extensively exploited to study cell signaling and metabolic path-
ways, transcription regulatory mechanisms, gene expression, sub-
cellular localization of proteins, protein––protein interactions, and 
virus replication. Therefore, they represent an efﬁcient platform for 
virus–host interaction molecular studies. Several protoplast isola-
tion protocols have been established for model plants and some 
crops [1]. Nevertheless, protoplasts prepared from leaves are often 
the preferential choice. High-yielding mesophyll protoplasts can be 
easily obtained from Arabidopsis, tobacco, common bean, maize, 
rice, and many other plant species [1–6]. These mesophyll proto-
plasts can be easily adapted to assay virus DNA replication. This

described protocol has been recently used to ensure the lack of 
replication function of the host protein NISP, involved in begomo-
virus intracellular movement [7].

Laura Gonc¸ alves Costa Martins and Elizabeth P. B. Fontes
Begomovirus is the largest and most agronomically relevant 
genus of the Geminiviridae family and contains both monopartite 
and bipartite viruses with a single- or double-genomic conﬁgura-
tion, respectively [8, 9]. The genomic components of bipartite 
begomoviruses are designated DNA-A and DNA-B; the single-
genomic component organization of monopartite begomoviruses 
resembles the DNA-A of bipartite begomoviruses [8, 9]. DNA-A 
contains 
six 
functionally 
characterized 
open 
reading 
frames 
(ORFs), two in the virion sense (the capsid protein, CP or AV1 
and AV2) and four in the complementary sense (replication initia-
tor protein, Rep or AC1; transcription activator protein, Trap or 
AC2; replication enhancer protein, Ren or AC3; and AC4). The 
DNA-B encodes two genes, the virion-sense BV1, which corre-
sponds to NSP (nuclear shuttle protein), and the complementary-
sense BC1 or MP (movement protein). 
Geminiviruses use the rolling circle mechanism of replication to 
replicate the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) genome inside the 
nucleus of infected cells. The unpacked viral ssDNA is ﬁrst con-
verted into double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) by the host DNA 
polymerase α, which synthesizes the complementary strand to gen-
erate the viral dsDNA intermediate [10]. Then, the host DNA 
polymerase δ synthesizes new, nascent copies of the geminivirus 
ssDNA genome. In addition to replicating its genome in infected 
cells, for productive infection in plants, the begomovirus genome 
must move from the nucleus to the cytosol via nuclear pores and 
then to adjacent cells via the plasmodesmata [11, 12]. Therefore, 
the efﬁcient accumulation of begomoviral DNA within plants 
results from the viral genome replication in the nucleus of infected 
cells, like other DNA viruses, and intercellular transport of viral 
DNA to adjacent, uninfected cells, as for any other plant virus 
[13, 14]. 
To understand the mechanisms involved in virus–host interac-
tion and the role of virus and host proteins in mediating virus 
replication uncoupled from virus movement, we describe a proto-
col for assaying begomovirus replication in Arabidopsis protoplasts. 
Although this method can be easily modiﬁed to assay replication of 
any other plant viruses in mesophyll protoplasts of the more per-
missive host Nicotiana benthamiana, some peculiarities for ssDNA 
viruses that replicate in the nuclei of infected plants via dsDNA 
intermediates must be considered. For instance, input DNA of 
infectious clones that naturally persists as contaminants in proto-
plasts can be easily distinguished from newly synthesized viral DNA 
by Dpn I digestion, which recognizes methylated dam sites in 
prokaryotic DNA. By using DpnI site-ﬂanking primers in the viral 
genome, 
the 
amplicon 
to 
be 
quantiﬁed 
will 
result 
from

DpnI-resistant genomes that have been replicated in eukaryotic 
cells. The method involves transfecting Arabidopsis protoplasts 
with infectious clones containing partial tandem repeats of cabbage 
leaf curl virus (CabLCV) DNA-A, extracting and digesting total 
DNA with Dpn1, and quantifying newly replicated vDNA by 
qPCR. 
Begomovirus Replication in Protoplasts
113
Several different methods to prepare protoplasts have been 
described [15, 16]. For instance, for replication assays of gemini-
virus genomes, we used to prepare the protoplasts from suspension 
cells, which involves tissue culture manipulation for obtaining and 
maintenance of viable cell suspension [17, 18]. In contrast, a rapid 
and efﬁcient protocol for mesophyll protoplast preparation from 
mature Arabidopsis leaves has been established [6]. These meso-
phyll protoplasts will probably become more prevalent in virus– 
plant interaction studies as the mesophyll protoplast preparation 
achieves high efﬁciency and sensitivity and does not require com-
plex tissue culture medium and techniques.

Methods 
3.1 
Protoplast 
Isolation from 
Arabidopsis Leaves 
Plant protoplasts without cell walls offer an efﬁcient cell-based 
experimental system for replication assays of plant viruses. Mole-
cules of CabLCV DNA-A (or any other Arabidopsis-infecting 
geminivirus) can be introduced in Arabidopsis protoplasts using 
the method PEG–calcium fusion.

Growth of the Arabidopsis Plants 
1. Grow Arabidopsis plants on soil in a greenhouse or an 
environmental-controlled chamber. Try to maintain a stable 
environment as much as possible, to avoid environmental 
changes and stresses to the planta (see Note 1). 
Preparation of Plasmid DNA 
2. Grow CabLCV DNA-A (infectious clones) and LeNIK2-NS-
pDONR207 (as an internal control) constructs in a 50-mL 
ﬂask containing 10 mL Luria–Bertani (LB) liquid medium, 
supplemented 
with 
speciﬁc 
antibiotic, 
with 
shaking 
at 
160 rpm at 37 °C overnight (see Note 9). 
3. Extract and purify plasmid DNA from E. coli using the QIA-
prep® Spin Miniprep Kit, following the manufacturer’s proce-
dure. Adjust the plasmid DNA concentration to 1–1.5 μg/μL 
of plasmid DNA (see Note 12). 
Protoplast Isolation 
4. Select well-expanded and healthy leaves from 3- to 4-week-old 
plants before ﬂowering (Fig. 1a, red stars) (see Note 13). 
5. From the middle part of a selected leaf, cut 0.5–1.0 mm leaf 
strips on a clean white paper ﬁlter using a fresh sharp razor 
blade (Fig. 1b). Be careful not to crush the tissue at the cutting 
site. The paper ﬁlter facilitates the inspection of crushing at the 
cutting sites (see Note 14). 
6. Quickly and gently transfer the leaf strips into the prepared 
enzyme solution (10 leaves in 5 mL) by completely submerging 
both sides of the strips (Fig. 1c, d) (see Note 15). 
7. Vacuum inﬁltrate the petri dish containing the leaf strips using a 
desiccator for 20–30 min at room temperature (see Note 16). 
8. Incubate the leaf strips in the enzymatic digestion solution 
without shaking in the dark for 2–3 h at room temperature. 
The enzyme solution should turn green, indicating the release 
of the protoplasts (Fig. 1e) (see Note 17). 
9. Check the release of protoplasts in the solution using a light 
microscope. The released protoplasts look spherical, while the 
undigested cells appear more irregular (Fig. 1f) (see Note 18). 
10. To complete the digestion of the leaf, dilute the enzyme/ 
protoplast solution with 5 mL of W5 solution before 
ﬁltration. 
11. Filter the enzyme solution containing protoplasts gently pass-
ing through a clean 70 μm nylon mesh (see Note 19).

4-week-old Arabidopsis plant will be used for the protoplast isolation. Red stars indicate healthy expanded 
leaves. (b) Inspection of cutting edges. Arabidopsis leaves are cut with a razor blade and placed in a clean

(h) Transfected protoplast pellets after centrifugation at room temperature and carefully removing the 
supernatant. (i) Arabidopsis protoplasts were transfected and visualized by light microscopy after 14 h of 
incubation in the dark 
12. Transfer the digested protoplast to a 15-mL round-bottom 
tube using a wide-end tip pipet. Centrifuge the ﬂow-through 
at 100 g to pellet the protoplasts at room temperature for 
2–4 min (see Note 20).

118
Laura Gonc¸ alves Costa Martins and Elizabeth P. B. Fontes
13. Remove slowly as much supernatant as possible without dis-
turbing the protoplast pellet. Then gently resuspend the pro-
toplast pellet at 2 × 105 mL-1 in cold W5 solution. Count cells 
under a microscope using a hemacytometer (Fig. 1g). Incubate 
the resuspended protoplast mixture on ice for 30 min (see 
Note 21). 
14. This 30-min incubation time on ice allows the protoplast to 
settle at the bottom of the tube by gravity. Remove the W5 
solution using a 1-mL pipette without disturbing the proto-
plast pellets. Resuspend the protoplast pellet gently in MMG 
solution (kept at room temperature) at 2 × 105 protoplast mL-
1 . 
3.2 
PEG–Calcium-
Mediated Protoplast 
Transfection 
1. Add 100 μL of protoplasts (2 × 104 protoplasts) into 2-mL 
round-bottom tubes. 
2. Add 10 or 20 μL DNA (10–15 μg of plasmid DNA, infectious 
DNA-A clone), mixing gently into each aliquot of protoplasts 
(see Note 22). 
3. Add 110 μL of freshly prepared PEG-Calcium solution and 
then gently rotate to mix well (handle six to ten samples for 
each transfection) (see Note 23). 
4. Incubate the transfection mixture at room temperature for up 
to 15 min. 
5. Dilute the transfection mixture with 400–440 μL W5 solution 
at room temperature. Mix well by gently rocking or inverting 
the tube to stop the transfection process. 
6. Centrifuge at 100 × g for 2–4 min at room temperature. After 
centrifugation, the supernatant is carefully removed using a 
pipette. 
7. Resuspend protoplasts gently with 1 mL of WI solution. 
3.3 
Protoplast 
Incubation 
1. Coat a 12-well tissue culture plate with 5% (v/v) calf serum for 
a short time (1 min) for each well to prevent sticking of the 
protoplasts to the plastic surface. After 1-min incubation, aspi-
rate the coating solution. 
2. Transfer the protoplasts from each tube to each well of the 
culture plate and cover the plate. 
3. Incubate the protoplasts at room temperature for 12–18 h 
(time 0), 1.5 days, 2.5 days, 3.5 days, and 4.5 days in the dark. 
4. Then, collect the protoplasts by transferring the protoplast 
solution to 2 mL round-bottom tubes and centrifuging at 
100 × g for 2–4 min at room temperature. 
5. Remove the supernatant (Fig. 1h) and freeze samples on dry ice 
(see Note 24).

6. Before freezing the samples on dry ice, transfer 10 μL o  
transfected protoplasts to a glass-bottom dish and cover with 
a glass coverslip to visualize using a light microscope (Fig. 1i) to  
assess the status of the protoplast, monitor the integrity of their 
membrane and their ability to develop over time. 
3.4 
qPCR and PCR-
Based Diagnostic of 
Viral DNA 
1. Resuspend the protoplast pellet in CTAB buffer for DNA 
extraction [19]. 
2. Eliminate RNA contamination in genomic DNA samples by 
incubating the samples with RNase (10 ng/μL) at 37 °C for 
10 min. 
3. Determine DNA concentration by NanoDrop spectrophotom-
eter (Fig. 2a, b) and ensure an equal amount of inoculum at 
time zero in comparative DNA replication assays by qPCR 
(Fig. 2c). 
4. Digest 1 μg of total DNA extracted from protoplasts with 10 U 
of restriction enzyme Dpn I for 1 h at 37 °C. Stop the reaction 
by heat inactivation (20 min at 80 °C). 
5. For PCR-based diagnostic, use approximately 100 ng template 
DNA, 1 μL (10 μM) speciﬁc forward and reverse primers, and 
12.5 μL PCR Master Mix (if 2×) to a ﬁnal volume of 25 μL and 
separate the products by electrophoresis through an agarose gel 
(Fig. 2d, e). 
6. Determine the viral DNA accumulation via quantitative PCR 
(Fig. 2f). Reaction mix: 100 ng of DNA extracts from trans-
fected Arabidopsis protoplasts, 1 μL of the corresponding 
10 μM gene-speciﬁc primer, 10 μL of 2× SYBR Green Master 
Mix (if not 2×, calculate the volume accordingly), and ultra-
pure H2O to 20  μL (see Note 25). 
7. Set up the real-time PCR system to the following thermal 
cycling conditions: an initial step at 95 °C for 10 min, followed 
by 40 cycles at 94 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. 
8. For absolute quantiﬁcation of viral DNA, prepare standard 
curves using serial dilutions of DNA-A of CabLCV (100 to 
109 copies of viral genome per reaction). Reaction mix for 
qPCR: 1 μL of each dilution of viral DNA, 4 μL of forward 
and reverse primers, and 5 μL of SYBR Green (if the master mix 
is 2×). Use three technical replicates of each serial dilution and 
the same thermal cycle described for protoplast DNA. Deter-
mine the linear regression equation of the quantiﬁcation cycle 
value (CT) x copy number of the viral genome (log10). 
9. For normalizing the data against an internal control, prepare 
standard curves of 18S rDNA, which accounts for template 
input variation, using the same qPCR protocol. For the 18S

Quantiﬁcation of the DNA inoculum (CabLCV DNA-A infectious clone). Total DNA extracted zero-time post-
transfection in nisp, and Col-0 protoplasts were quantiﬁed by qPCR and normalized to 18SrDNA. (d) 
Replication of CabLCV DNA-A in Col-0 protoplasts. Plasmids containing tandem copies repeats of CabLCV 
DNA-A were introduced into Col-0 protoplasts. Total DNA was isolated at the indicated days (d) post-
transfection and either used directly as a template in PCR-based diagnostic of viral DNA (top gel, CabLCV 
DNA-A) or digested with DpnI prior to PCR (bottom gel, DpnI). In the Dpn1 agarose gel, the last lane 
corresponds to the ampliﬁcation of input DNA not treated with DpnI, as a positive control. Newly synthesized 
viral DNA is represented by the DpnI-resistant amplicon. The early saturation of nascent viral DNA accumula-
tion in protoplasts may be due to the low and limited number of transfected protoplasts prepared directly from 
leaves. Viable protoplasts were monitored via the ampliﬁcation of an endogenous Actin gene. E. Negative 
control plasmid for the replication assay. The recombinant pDONR201 plasmid, containing a copy of an 
unrelated gene LeNIK2, was introduced into Col-0 by the polyethylene glycol method. Total DNA was extracted 
at different post-transfection intervals, digested with DpnI, and used as a template for the ampliﬁcation of 
LeNIK2. No DpnI-resistant amplicon was detected. The last lane is a positive control using DpnI-untreated 
input DNA as a template. Actin was ampliﬁed from endogenous genomic DNA. F. Absolute quantiﬁcation of 
newly synthesized viral DNA by qPCR. Total DNA extracted from transfected Col-0 and nisp-1 protoplasts was 
digested with DpnI. The replicated DpnI-resistant amplicon was quantiﬁed by qPCR, using speciﬁc DpnI site-
ﬂanking primers in the viral DNA-A genome. Error bars indicate 95% conﬁdence intervals based on replicated

10. Analyze the resulting quantiﬁcation data using Tukey’s test and 
the 2-ΔCT statistical method. 
11. To calculate the genomic units/ ng 18S rDNA, convert the CT 
values using the standard curves for CabLCV plasmid DNA 
and 18S rDNA (Fig. 3a, b).

Notes 
1. Arabidopsis plants are susceptible to environmental changes. 
Indeed, stress conditions may signiﬁcantly alter the genetic 
proﬁles of plants and ultimately affect the integrity of the 
protoplast preparation. Therefore, maintain plant growth 
under a constant environment to increase the quality and 
transfection efﬁciency of the protoplasts. 
2. Macerozyme R-10 and Cellulase “Onozuka R-10” are often 
used to isolate plant protoplasts. The original mesophyll proto-
plast isolation [6] recommends the enzymes from Yakult Phar-
maceutical Ind. We never tested other providers. 
3. PEG 4000 is critical to achieving high transfection efﬁciency; 
do not use PEG another molecular weight. 
4. The enzyme solution should be prepared fresh; the ﬁnal solu-
tion should be clear and light brown. 
5. 5–10 mL of enzyme solution digest approximately 10–15 
leaves, giving 0.5–1 × 106 protoplasts enough for more than 
25 samples. 
6. Before adding the enzyme powders, the MES solution must be 
preheated at 70 °C for 3–5 min for better dissolution of MES, 
and then, it should be cooled down to prepare the enzyme 
solution. Preheat an approximate volume to be used to prepare 
the fresh enzyme solution. 
7. 55 °C for 10 min will inactivate DNase and proteases and 
increase the enzyme solubilization efﬁciency. 
8. The PEG solution can be stored at RT for replication assays in 
mesophyll protoplasts. However, to increase transfection efﬁ-
ciency, use a freshly prepared PEG solution. The PEG solution 
should be prepared at least 1 h before transfection to be 
completely dissolved. Do not autoclave the PEG solution.

9. As an internal control, one may use any prokaryotic plasmid 
DNA, as it serves to conﬁrm the efﬁciency of DpnI digestion. 
For the infectious DNA-A from begomoviruses, one should 
use a DNA construct containing tandem copy repeats (often 
1.3–1.6 copies) of DNA-A and duplicated replication origins 
(see Chap. 4, Construction of geminivirus infectious clones for 
agroinoculation into plants). These constructs can be gener-
ated from cloned single copies of the virus genome (DNA-A) 
or can be obtained from different laboratories. Several infec-
tious DNA-A from bipartite begomoviruses and infections

Begomovirus Replication in Protoplasts

genome from monopartite begomoviruses and other gemini-
viruses are published and available upon request. 
10. DpnI digests only dam methylated input DNA, not newly 
synthesized CabLCV DNA-A in the Arabidopsis protoplasts. 
11. The primers designed to verify viral DNA accumulation in 
protoplasts by PCR or quantify (by qPCR) newly synthesized 
CabLCV-DNA-A in protoplast must amplify Dpn1 site-
containing fragments of DNA-A. Digestion of the protoplast 
DNA with Dpn1 prior to qPCR will ensure that only Dpn1-
resistant amplicons will be quantiﬁed. Those are derived from 
newly synthesized CabLCV DNA-A in Arabidopsis protoplasts 
and not from input DNA previously propagated in prokaryotic 
E. coli. 
12. High concentrations of puriﬁed plasmid DNA are crucial for 
protoplast transfection. 
13. The selection of healthy leaves at the proper stage of develop-
ment is an essential step for mesophyll protoplast isolation. 
Plant stress responses are critical in steering the development 
of cells, tissues, and organs. Therefore, protoplasts prepared 
from healthy leaves without stress contribute to the high trans-
fection efﬁciency of the protoplast preparation. 
14. 106 protoplasts are enough for the experiment. Cut the leaves 
on a piece of clean white paper on a laboratory bench to 
provide proper support and easy inspection of the cut tissues. 
15. For an enhanced protoplast yield, immediately dip and sub-
merge the leaf strips in the enzyme solution to prevent them 
from drying on the paper during cutting. 
16. Inﬁltration of leaf tissues is critical for mesophyll protoplasts’ 
quick release and yield. 
17. The efﬁciency of protoplast isolation differs signiﬁcantly for 
different plant species, ecotypes, and genotypes, and each one 
requires optimization of the digestion time. However, a good 
time for starting would be 3 h of digestion, when most of the 
Arabidopsis protoplasts are released from the leaf. 
18. Avoid over-digestion and long incubation times. The complete 
release of all the protoplasts from leaf strips is unnecessary. 
19. This ﬁltering process removes undigested leaf tissues and 
debris, while the released protoplasts pass through the mesh. 
20. Set centrifuge acceleration and deceleration rates at the lowest 
setting to minimize protoplast damage during the centrifuga-
tion. Using the round-bottom tube and swinging-bucket 
rotors is highly recommended.

21. During protoplast resuspension, slowly add 1 mL of W5 solu-
tion along the side of the tube before adding the remaining 
9 mL of W5 solution. 
22. The size of the plasmid DNA construct impacts the transfec-
tion efﬁciency. For CabLCV DNA-A constructs with tandem 
repeat copies (1½ copies) of DNA-A, the transfection efﬁ-
ciency has been optimized for 10–15 μg of infectious DNA 
construct. 
23. The concentration of PEG–calcium solution should be opti-
mized empirically. For begomovirus replication assays, we use a 
30% PEG ﬁnal concentration. 
24. If necessary, the samples can be stored at -80 °C until further 
analysis. 
25. Each standard dilution is analyzed by three technical replicates.

Monitoring the Intracellular Trafﬁcking of Virus-Induced 
Structures and Intercellular Spread of Viral Infection 
in Plants Using Endomembrane Trafﬁcking 
Pathway-Speciﬁc Chemical Inhibitor 
and Organelle-Selective Fluorescence Dye 
Yinzi Li and Aiming Wang 
Abstract 
Infection by positive-strand RNA viruses induces extensive remodeling of the host endomembrane system 
in favor of viral replication and movement. The integral membrane protein 6K2 of potyviruses induces the 
formation of membranous virus replication vesicles at the endoplasmic reticulum exit site (ERES). The 
intracellular trafﬁcking of 6K2-induced vesicles along with microﬁlaments requires the vesicular transport 
pathway, actomyosin motility system, and possibly post-Golgi compartments such as endosomes as well. 
Recent studies have shown that endocytosis is essential for the intracellular movement of potyviruses from 
the site of viral genome replication/assembly site to plasmodesmata (PD) to enter neighboring cells. In this 
chapter, we describe a detailed protocol of how to use endomembrane trafﬁcking pathway-speciﬁc chemical 
inhibitors and organelle-selective ﬂuorescence dye to study the trafﬁcking of potyviral proteins and 
potyvirus-induced vesicles and to unravel the role of endocytosis and the endocytic pathway in potyvirus 
infection in Nicotiana benthamiana plants.

Introduction 
Upon infection, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses induce 
extensive remodeling of the host endomembrane system in favor of 
the viral replication process [1]. The biogenesis of virus-induced 
membranous vesicles to anchor the viral replication complex (VRC) 
is a prerequisite for viral genome replication. Depending on the 
type of virus, a speciﬁc cytoplasmic organelle may be targeted for 
the induction of the virus-induced membranous vesicles. Such 
membranous structures provide speciﬁc cytoplasmic safeguarded

microcompartments to protect virus genome replication from anti-
viral RNA silencing and other host defense mechanisms [2]. VRCs 
contain both viral and host components [3].

In plants, the endomembrane system includes the plasma mem-
brane (PM), nuclear envelope, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the 
Golgi apparatus, trans-Golgi network (TGN), endosome, and vac-
uole [4]. The secretory and endocytic pathways are two major 
transport routes of the plant endomembrane system. In particular, 
the early secretory pathway between the ER and Golgi is mediated 
by COPII- and COPI-coated vesicles [5], whereas the transport 
between plasma membrane (PM), TGN, endosome, and vacuole, 
known as the late secretory pathway, is mostly dependent on 
clathrin-coated vesicles [6]. 
In the case of potyviruses, the potyviral integral membrane 
protein 6K2 induces the proliferation of ER membranes for the 
formation of viral vesicles to facilitate the assembly of viral replica-
tion complexes [7]. Previous studies revealed that the biogenesis of 
the potyviral 6K2 vesicles occurs at the COPII-accumulating ER 
exit sites (ERES) on the ER membrane [8]. The 6K2 virus-induced 
vesicles are mobile and align with microﬁlaments [9]. Many of them 
trafﬁc from the ER to the periphery of chloroplasts [10, 11]. The 
early secretory pathway and actomyosin motility system are essen-
tial for these intracellular movements. 
Endocytosis and endosomal trafﬁcking regulate the internali-
zation or uptake of membrane lipids, the proteins targeted to the 
plasma membrane, or extracellular materials into the cell. Endocy-
tosis is mainly comprised of clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) 
and clathrin-independent endocytosis (CIE), based on the involve-
ment of clathrin [12]. Many animal viruses have taken advantage of 
endocytosis to establish infection. The endocytic uptake and endo-
somal trafﬁcking provide vesicular transport across the plasma 
membrane to allow viruses access to intracellular organelles 
[13]. In recent years, emerging evidence suggests that the endocy-
tic pathway and endocytosis machinery have been hijacked by plant 
viruses for their infection [14–16]. The latest reports from our 
laboratory showed that potyviral 6K2-induced vesicles also target 
late endosomes during viral genome replication [17, 18]. 
The mechanism of how virus-induced vesicles trafﬁc between 
endomembrane compartments remains largely unknown. To 
explore the involvement of the endomembrane system in intracel-
lular viral transport, chemical inhibitors speciﬁc for certain endo-
membrane pathways and/or organelle-speciﬁc ﬂuorescence dyes 
may serve as very useful tools. 
Chemical inhibitors may transiently disrupt certain biological 
functions without the generation of genetic mutants. By using 
different inhibitors that target speciﬁc organelle structures and 
pathways, it becomes possible to affect secretory and trafﬁcking 
pathways [19]. The perturbation effect may be optimized by

adjusting treatment time and inhibitor concentration. Indeed, sev-
eral chemical inhibitors, such as brefeldin A (BFA), tyrphostin A23, 
and dynasore have been used extensively in our research to investi-
gate the function of the ER-Golgi transport and the endocytosis 
pathway associated with the trafﬁcking of potyviral proteins and 
virus-induced vesicles (Table 1) [28]. 
Chemical Inhibitor and Fluorescence Dye in Virus Research
129
BFA is an inhibitor that disrupts the ER-Golgi vesicular trans-
port pathway (Robinson et al., 2008). To determine whether poty-
viral virus-induced vesicle is transported through ER-Golgi 
secretory pathway to chloroplasts, we examined the distribution 
of virus-induced 6K2 vesicles tagged with YFP (6K2-YFP) without 
or in the presence of BFA. Clearly, upon treatment of this inhibitor, 
some potyviral 6K2-induced vesicles were redistributed within the 
ER network, and targeting and trafﬁcking of 6K2-induced vesicles 
to chloroplasts were affected [11] (Fig. 1). 
Recently, we have reported that potyviruses recruit endocytosis 
dynamin-like proteins through interacting with several potyviral 
proteins including VPg and CI for viral replication and transport 
[17]. Two chemical inhibitors of endocytosis, dynasore and Tyr 
A23, were used in the study of investigating the role of the endocy-
tosis pathway associated with potyvirus virus-induced vesicles and 
viral protein trafﬁcking (Fig. 2). 
Dynasore speciﬁcally targets dynamin to inhibit its activity and 
endocytosis by interfering with its GTPase activity [22]. Treatment 
with the dynamin-speciﬁc inhibitor dynasore disrupts endocytosis 
and impairs the transport of VPg and CI of the potyvirus turnip 
mosaic virus (TuMV) into endosomes, which results in the accu-
mulation of VPg and CI on the PM. These ﬁndings suggest that the 
trafﬁcking of TuMV VPg and CI is dependent on the endocytic 
pathway and further demonstrate that endocytosis and endosomal 
trafﬁcking play an essential role in potyvirus infection. 
Tyr A23 is also an endocytosis inhibitor that affects the recruit-
ment of endocytic cargo into clathrin-coated vesicles at the plasma 
membrane [24]. Treatment with Tyr A23 did not affect TuMV 
intercellular movement (Fig. 2), indicating potyviruses may recruit 
a 
clathrin-independent 
endocytic 
pathway 
for 
intercellular 
movement. 
In addition to chemical inhibitors, the technical advancement 
in live cell imaging and membrane-selective ﬂuorescence dye is also 
instrumental for visualizing and tracking virus-induced vesicles and 
viral protein transport and intracellular architecture remodeling.

important and versatile staining tool to track the endocytic trafﬁck-
ing network and to monitor the virus-induced vesicle and viral 
protein trafﬁcking in live plant cells [26, 27]. A colocalization 
study of the endocytic tracer FM4-64 with the CI protein of the 
potyvirus soybean mosaic virus (SMV) that was fused to YFP 
revealed that the CI colocalized with the punctate structures 
labeled by the FM4-64, suggesting its association with the endo-
cytic pathway (Fig. 3).

4. Follow standard confocal microscopy procedure. Set the para-
meters for each ﬂuorescent probe, the excitation, and emission 
wavelengths as follows (see Note 7): 
– For FM4-64: 543 nm (excitation) and 600–750 nm 
(emission).

Notes 
1. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is harmful, and personal protec-
tive equipment is needed. 
2. To avoid repeated thawing and freezing cycles, aliquot the 
stock solution to smaller volumes and store at -20 °C. 
3. FM4-64 is light sensitive. Wrap the tube with aluminum foil to 
minimize light exposure to ensure compound stability and 
prevent dye bleaching. 
4. The low OD600 value of 0.001 is used for the agrobacterial 
culture 
expressing 
PCB301TuMV-GFP//mCherry-HDEL 
infectious clone to study viral intercellular movement, which 
allows distinguishing primary and secondary infections in a few 
epidermal cells by expressing two expression cassettes. 
5. Keep the ﬁnal OD600 of each agrobacterial culture as low as 
possible to avoid protein overexpression or overloading of the 
cellular environment that might result in false-positive ﬂuores-
cence signals. 
6. FM4-64 inﬁltration time point is important due to FM4-64 
stability and the time required for transient expression. We 
recommend 48 h post-agroinﬁltration of the expression vector. 
7. Optimize laser power, gain, and offset for each separate ﬂuor-
ophore. 
Always 
use 
the 
sequential 
scanning 
mode 
for 
co-imaging multiple ﬂuorescent signals to avoid crosstalk 
between different ﬂuorophores.

Ribosome Proﬁling of Plants

Abstract 
Translation is a key step in control of gene expression, yet most analyses of global responses to a stimulus 
focus on transcription and the transcriptome. For RNA viruses in particular, which have no DNA-templated 
transcriptional control, control of viral and host translation is crucial. Here, we describe the method of 
ribosome proﬁling (ribo-seq) in plants, applied to virus infection. Ribo-seq is a deep sequencing technique 
that reveals the translatome by presenting a snapshot of the positions and relative amounts of translating 
ribosomes on all mRNAs in the cell. In contrast to RNA-seq, a crude cell extract is ﬁrst digested with 
ribonuclease to degrade all mRNA not protected by a translating 80S ribosome. The resulting ribosome-
protected fragments (RPFs) are deep sequenced. The number of reads mapping to a speciﬁc mRNA 
compared to the standard RNA-seq reads reveals the translational efﬁciency of that mRNA. Moreover, 
the precise positions of ribosome pause sites, previously unknown translatable open reading frames, and 
noncanonical translation events can be characterized quantitatively using ribo-seq. As this technique 
requires meticulous technique, here we present detailed step-by-step instructions for cell lysate preparation 
by ﬂash freezing of samples, nuclease digestion of cell lysate, monosome collection by sucrose cushion 
ultracentrifugation, size-selective RNA extraction and rRNA depletion, library preparation for sequencing 
and ﬁnally quality control of sequenced data. These experimental methods apply to many plant systems, 
with minor nuclease digestion modiﬁcations depending on the plant tissue and species. This protocol 
should be valuable for studies of plant virus gene expression, and the global translational response to virus 
infection, or any other biotic or abiotic stress, by the host plant.

Introduction 
Translation, the key event in all living things in which the genetic 
code is decoded as proteins are synthesized, has been underappre-
ciated as a regulatory stage of gene expression [1, 2]. Historically, 
gene expression monitoring has focused on the levels of mRNA 
(the transcriptome) determined by methods that continue to be 
more informative, such as the widely used high-throughput RNA 
sequencing (RNA-seq) [3]. However, monitoring RNA abundance 
alone is not sufﬁcient to determine protein expression level, 
because, as with transcription, the translation efﬁciencies can

change due to an external stimulus [4] or during development [5], 
and changes in mRNA level do not always correlate with changes in 
protein level [6]. Proteomics addresses this question, but measur-
ing protein levels combined with RNA-seq provides only an indi-
rect measure of translation efﬁciency and is affected by differences 
in protein stability.

Ribosome proﬁling (ribo-seq) has emerged as a powerful 
method that directly measures the translational efﬁciency of 
mRNAs [7, 8]. Ribo-seq reveals the positions and relative amounts 
of ribosomes on every mRNA in the cell at single nucleotide 
resolution. Thus, it can reveal mRNAs that are up- or down-
translated in response to a change in environment or developmental 
cue. It also detects sites of ribosome pausing that occur during 
critical translational control events. Ribo-seq is a modiﬁed RNA-
Seq-based technique, in which, instead of sequencing and counting 
total mRNA, only the mRNA tracts that are occupied by translating 
ribosomes are sequenced. Depending on the research objectives, 
ribo-seq can provide a panorama of the whole translation process 
[9]. In this method, a translation-arrested cell lysate is digested with 
RNase to degrade mRNA not protected by a translating ribosome. 
Then, the resulting ribosome-protected fragments (RPFs) are deep 
sequenced. The number of RPFs that map to each position on an 
mRNA indicates the ribosome density and thus its translational 
efﬁciency (TE) and also reveals ribosome pause sites (Fig. 1). 
1.1 
Application of 
Ribosome Proﬁling in 
Plant–Virus 
Interactions 
In addition to identifying unexpected coding regions and transla-
tional control mechanisms in host mRNAs, ribo-seq is invaluable 
for characterizing the numerous noncanonical translation events 
that are a hallmark of many positive-strand RNA viral genomes. 
For example, many viruses use recoding events such as stop codon 
read-through or ribosomal frameshifting [10]. Ribo-seq is the most 
accurate way of measuring the exact rate of read-through or frame-
shifting because the proportion of RPFs obtained from the ORFs 
before and after the recoding event is proportional to the number 
of ribosomes translating each ORF. This is more accurate than 
measuring ratios of viral or reporter proteins translated via the 
viral read-through/frameshift sequence, because the protein pro-
ducts may differ in stability. Thus, their levels would not be propor-
tional to the efﬁciency of translation of the ORFs that generated 
them. Also, viruses encode many small proteins from small ORFs 
that may not appear signiﬁcant [11]. Ribo-seq reveals all translated 
ORFs, including those that do not initiate with a canonical AUG 
start codon. Application of ribosome proﬁling to virus-infected 
human cells has revealed such highly quantitative details of coding 
capacity and gene expression [12, 13]. 
With regard to plant–pathogen interactions, Ribo-seq has 
revealed an unexpected translational upregulation of many genes 
in the plant immune system in response to bacterial infection

[14]. This later led to the identiﬁcation of a signal transduction 
pathway in which phosphorylation of translation factors released 
speciﬁc innate immune system genes from a translationally inhib-
ited state, upon detection of a bacterial effector [15]. A Ribo-seq 
study of sugarcane mosaic virus-infected maize found that photo-
synthetic and metabolic genes were both transcriptionally and 
translationally downregulated [16]. Given that many plant viral 
RNAs, such as the cap-independent translation elements of tom-
busvirids, and viral proteins, such as the genome-linked proteins 
(VPgs) of potyviruses and solemovirids, are known to bind key 
translation initiation factors [10, 17–19], these interactions might 
out-compete host mRNAs for the factors and alter their transla-
tion. Ribo-seq would be a powerful tool to answer these questions. 
Thus, we provide detailed methods here for plant virologists to 
employ Ribo-seq in the model plant Arabidopsis and the agro-
nomic crop (and also a model organism) maize [20].

This chapter provides details only for preparing and sequencing 
RPFs at the laboratory bench. However, after that process, a sub-
stantial amount of sequence data analysis is necessary to conﬁrm 
that the sequences represent true RPFs and to subsequently identify 
translational efﬁciencies, ribosome pause sites, and global control of 
translation. We provide a brief summary of data processing and 
analysis here. For more information on the processing and bionfor-
matics of Ribo-seq data, we refer the readers to Kiniry et al. [21] 
and Xiao et al. [22]. Initial data treatment is the same for ribo-seq 
and RNA-seq data, starting by assessing the quality of raw data by 
tools such as FastQC [23], followed by processing via quality and 
adapter trimming by tools such as Cutadapt [24]. Bowtie2 [25] is  
used to align the processed reads to the organism’s reference 
sequences for the rRNAs, tRNAs, and snoRNAs. The remaining 
reads are aligned to the reference transcriptome using Bowtie2 or 
to reference genome using splice-aware tools such as STAR 
[26]. There are two general approaches to counting reads: Con-
sider only uniquely mapped reads or estimate the true location of 
multi-mapped reads. We recommend featureCounts [27] for 
counting only uniquely mapped reads and RSEM [28] for counting 
multi-mapped reads. Statistical analysis of counted reads can be 
performed with edgeR [29], DESeq2 [30], xtail [22], or riboVI 
[31]. The latter two are designed speciﬁcally for ribo-seq data. 
RiboVI is the most sensitive, as it identiﬁes more genes as having 
statistically signiﬁcant changes in translation efﬁciency (TE) with a 
lower false discovery rate than the other methods, but tends to give 
a lower change in TE for each gene. We advise working with an

experienced statistician due to the complexity of the analyses. For 
RPF metagene analysis (discussed below), the authors recommend 
riboSeqR [32] if reference transcriptome mapping is used. If the 
RPFs are mapped to the reference genome, then RiboTaper [33] 
and RiboToolkit [34] are excellent tools for metagene analysis. 
Actively translating regions can be identiﬁed with RiboTaper 
[33]. Many of the above-listed programs and packages are used in 
a command-line environment and require some basic skills in 
scripting, R, and/or Python. Some web services perform all (Ribo-
Toolkit [34]) or many (RiboGalaxy [35]) of the above processes. 
Riboviz2 [36] and RiboVIEW [37] are command-line programs 
that perform many, but not all, of the steps above.

1.3 
Hallmarks of 
High-Quality Ribo-seq 
Data 
Ribo-seq data have speciﬁc hallmarks that are not present in RNA-
seq data. However, some RNA secondary structures or ribonucleo-
protein complexes not involved in translation may generate 
RPF-length fragments. Therefore, it is imperative to distinguish 
true RPFs from artifacts. The following features are hallmarks of 
high-quality Ribo-seq data with true RPFs: 
(i) Narrow Length Distribution. Depending on variety of organ-
isms, ribosome-protected fragment length may vary. Still ribo-
somes protect predominantly one speciﬁc size of RNA for a 
given organism (e.g., 28 nt for Arabidopsis [8] and 30 nt for 
maize [20]). In high-quality Ribo-seq data, the length distri-
bution is mostly enriched to a single RPF length (Fig. 2a) 
along with very few other RPF lengths, whereas in RNA-seq 
data there is a broad read length distribution (Fig. 2b). RPFs 
with good triplet periodicity (described below) show a narrow 
length distribution [8]. 
(ii) CDS Enrichment. Almost all reads from ribo-seq data map to 
the coding sequence (CDS) because only the translating 80S 
ribosome protects mRNA from the RNase treatment used to 
obtain the RPFs. In contrast, RNA-seq data will always map to 
both CDS and UTRs (Fig. 2c–d). 
(iii) Triplet Periodicity. As mentioned above, ribosomes generate 
more RPFs at pause sites. Because ribosomes pause brieﬂy at 
each codon, this pausing can be detected in the form of more 
reads mapping to every third base in a CDS (Fig. 2e). This 
triplet periodicity is absent in RNA-seq data because RNA-seq 
is obtained from random fragmentation of total RNA in the 
absence of ribosomes (Fig. 2f). Both the CDS enrichment and 
triplet periodicity in ribo-seq data and lack thereof in RNA-seq 
data can be observed in the same metagene analysis plot that 
maps positions of reads relative to codons in all mRNAs com-
bined (Fig. 2e–h).

1.4 
Translation 
Efﬁciency 
Once the quality of RPFs has been conﬁrmed, the translation 
efﬁciency (TE) can be calculated for each mRNA using software 
such as Xtail [22]. TE is the ratio of RPF abundance to mRNA 
abundance; as the more ribosomes are translating an mRNA, the 
more RPFs will be captured by ribo-seq. Thus, ribo-seq, when 
compared to the RNA-seq that is performed on the same sample, 
allows one to measure precisely how much change in expression of a 
given gene is due to transcription and how much is due to transla-
tion, the ultimate goal of ribosome proﬁling.

Methods 
3.1 
Lysate 
Preparation 
1. Collect the plant leaves in liquid nitrogen-chilled 50-mL falcon 
tubes containing two 4.8-mm beads (see Notes 1 and 2). 
2. Coarsely pulverize the leaves by vigorously shaking the tube 
and transfer them to liquid nitrogen-chilled 1.5-mL microfuge 
tubes containing 8–10 2-mm zirconium oxide beads. 
3. Subsequently, pulverize the tissues into ﬁne powder using a 
TissueLyser (1500 rpm for 30 s, twice), followed by adding 
800 μL of PEB (see Note 3). 
4. Incubate the crude lysate in ice for 20 min on a rocker followed 
by clariﬁcation using two rounds of centrifugation (21,100 × g, 
15 min, 4 °C). 
5. Subsequently, use NanoDrop to adjust the absorbance of the 
lysate with PEB to A254 (Lysate – PEB) ≈ A260 (Lysate – 
PEB) ≈ 6 (see Note 4). 
6. Save a 200 μL aliquot of lysate to be used for total RNA 
extraction (Subheading 3.3). Dispense 400 μL aliquots of 
remaining lysate in 1.5-mL microfuge tubes for RPF puriﬁca-
tion (Subheading 3.2). If necessary, these can be ﬂash-frozen 
and stored at -80 °C for future extraction (see Note 5).

Processing and Quality 
Assessment 
1. Assess the quality of raw sequencing reads using FastQC [20]. 
2. Use Cutadapt [21] to remove the adapters from the raw 
sequencing 
reads 
using 
the 
following 
parameters: 
“-a 
TGGAATTCT 
CGGGTGCCAAGG—discard-untrimmed— 
minimum-length 23.”

four nucleotides from the ends of ribo-seq and RNA-seq reads, 
which were added during library preparation. 
4. Subsequently, retain the 27 to 32 nt ribo-seq reads and 25 to 
40 nt RNA-seq reads and ﬁlter out the rest.

Jahanara Sonia et al.
5. Use RiboToolkit [34] to assess ribo-seq-speciﬁc data character-
istics, such as length distribution, triplet periodicity, frame 
enrichment, the distribution of reads over different mRNA 
features, etc. 
6. Further data processing and analysis would largely depend on 
the experiment objectives and would include mapping the 
reads to ncRNA and using the ncRNA-unmapped reads to 
subsequently map to the organism’s reference genome (see 
Note 26).

Notes 
1. Preparing the lysate as soon as the plant tissue is collected is 
advisable. We recommend purifying RPF RNA from the lysate 
as early as possible. In case of storing at -80 °C, we recom-
mend doing it after snap-freezing the lysate. 
2. The amount of plant material collected would largely depend 
on the plant, the kind of tissues, and the age of the plant. 
Different amounts of tissues can be collected for different 
samples because, after lysate preparation, all the samples 
would be normalized to the same RNA/protein amounts 
using the absorbance at 254 and 260 nm. 
3. The plant tissues should always be chilled in liquid nitrogen 
during tissue pulverization. 
4. A254 and A260 refer to the absorbance measured at 254 and 
260 nm wavelength, respectively, using NanoDrop. The absor-
bance of PEB is subtracted from the absorbance of lysate to 
give A254 (Lysate – PEB) or A260 (Lysate – PEB). If this is less 
than 6, it means more tissue is required. If it is more, it can be 
lowered by dilution with PEB. The absorbance is adjusted to 
6 because RNase 1 digestion is optimized according to these 
values. 
5. The PEB is optimized to preserve ribosome occupancy on an 
mRNA and encourage RNase digestion by RNase 1. Therefore, 
the total RNA integrity is not guaranteed to be maintained in 
this buffer. To overcome this limitation, the total RNA extrac-
tion must be carried out immediately after the adjustment of 
lysate absorbance to ensure the collection of full-length 
mRNAs. An aliquot of lysate can be stored at -80 °C for the 
extraction of RPFs at a later stage. 
6. Sucrose cushion is a dense sucrose pad that allows separation of 
tightly coupled active ribosomes without any mechanical stress. 
During ultracentrifugation with sucrose cushion, ribosome 
footprint complex will travel through the highly dense sucrose 
pad with high sedimentation rate to form a pellet, while other

Ribosome Proﬁling of Plants
157
low molecular weight subunits (proteins/RNA) will remain in 
the supernatant. Though sucrose gradients can be used to 
separate ribosomes from other individual subunits according 
to their density, it may increase the chances of contamination 
with untranslated but protein-bound RNA molecules. Also, if 
the lysate volume is more than 400 μL, then add PEB accord-
ingly to make the volume 750 μL before layering it on a sucrose 
cushion. Care must be taken when layering the lysate on a 
sucrose cushion to create a sharp junction between the two 
solutions with minimal to no mixing between them. Addition-
ally, the time duration from sample layering to ultracentrifuga-
tion should be minimized. Furthermore, the pellet may be hard 
to see, and therefore, circle the area on the tube with a marker 
where the pellet is expected to form. 
7. Rinsing the pellet with nuclease-free water is an optional step. 
Rinsing is done to wash away non-pelleted RNA and other 
contaminants. The risk of this step is that the pellet can be 
lost if it dissolves in the water or if it comes loose off the tube 
wall. Therefore, if rinsing is carried out, ice-cold nuclease-free 
water should be added on to the tube wall and removed by 
pipetting quickly but steadily on the tube wall opposite to the 
pellet side. 
8. The pellet may not be completely dissolved at this stage. There-
fore, care must be taken during transfer to make sure pellet 
pieces are not retained in the tube or in the pipette tip. 
9. Acid–phenol–chloroform extraction must be carried in a fume-
hood. Because phenol–chloroform is heated, the tubes usually 
open and splatter. Therefore, the necessary personal protective 
equipment must be worn, including safety glasses. 
10. At this stage, total RNA can either be subjected to DNase 
treatment, followed by RNA integrity assessment by denatur-
ing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, or stored at -80 °C. 
DNase treatment and gel electrophoresis of total RNA and 
RPFs can be conducted simultaneously. 
11. A greater volume of ethanol is added to RPF RNA samples to 
ensure precipitation of the small ~28 nt RPFs. 
12. Mix 0.5 μL DNase-treated RNA with 4.5 μL water and 5 μL  2x  
RNA loading dye. Similarly, for size markers, (i) mix 1 pmol 
each of 28 nt and 34 nt RNA oligos with water and RNA 
loading dye to 10 ul, and (ii) mix 50 ng 10/60 nt IDT 
ssDNA ladder with water and RNA loading dye to 10 ul. 
Denature the samples at 70 °C for 5 min and immediately 
transfer the samples to ice. Clean the wells of 15% TBE–Urea 
gel with the running buffer by pipetting and immediately load 
the denatured samples. Run the gel as indicated, open the gel 
cassette, and subsequently stain the gel in a square petri dish

with ice-cold SYBR Gold staining solution (3 μL SYBR Gold in 
30 μL 1x TBE buffer) for 2 min on a shaker. Cover the petri 
dish with aluminum foil to protect it from light. Discard the 
staining solution and add 30 mL ice-cold 1x TBE buffer. 
Immediately proceed to image the gel with a gel imager. For 
total RNA samples, the two larger rRNA bands should be 
present with minimal bands present between the RNA oligo 
size markers (Fig. 3a). 
13. Mix 1 μL DNase-treated RNA with 4 μL water and 5 μL 2x  
RNA loading dye. Similarly, for size markers, (i) mix 2 pmol 
each of 28 nt and 34 nt RNA oligos with water and RNA 
loading dye to 10 ul and (ii) mix 50 ng 10/60 nt IDT 
ssDNA ladder with water and RNA loading dye to 10 ul. 
Denature the samples at 70 °C for 5 min and immediately 
transfer the samples to ice. Clean the 15% TBE-Urea gel wells 
with the running buffer (1x TBE) by pipetting and immedi-
ately load the denatured samples. Run the gel as indicated, 
open the gel cassette, and subsequently stain the gel in a square 
petri dish with ice-cold SYBR Gold staining solution (3 μL 
SYBR Gold in 30 μL 1x TBE buffer) for 2 min on a shaker. 
Cover the petri dish with aluminum foil to protect it from light. 
Discard the staining solution and add 30 mL ice-cold 1x TBE 
buffer. Immediately proceed to image the gel with a gel imager. 
One or a few sharp and distinct RPF bands should be observed 
between the RNA oligo size markers. 
14. The sale of Illumina Ribo-Zero as a stand-alone kit has been 
discontinued by the time of writing this chapter. However, the 
components for rRNA depletion are included with the pur-
chase of the Illumina TruSeq Library Preparation Kit. Alterna-
tively, rRNA depletion kits from other vendors, such as the 
RiboMinus Plant Kit for RNA-seq from Thermo Fisher Scien-
tiﬁc, may be used with appropriate modiﬁcations. 
15. Load size markers on the gel after every two samples to ensure 
accurate and precise size selection. 
16. Do not spend time visualizing the gel using a gel imager. As 
soon as the staining solution is added, the RNA starts diffusing 
out of the gel. Therefore, proceed to cut the gel immediately 
after staining. Firstly, cut the region of the samples horizontally 
and then vertically. Use a new baked blade (sterilized) for every 
cut. Then, using a new baked blade and a 10-μL tip, pick up the 
gel slice and transfer it to a pierced 0.5-mL tube in a 2-mL 
microfuge tube. 
17. Using an 18G syringe needle, pierce a hole at the bottom of a 
0.5-mL tube and then place this tube in a 2-mL microfuge 
tube. Upon centrifugation, the gel slice will be crushed into 
smaller pieces when it passes through the hole, getting then 
collected in the 2-mL tube.

excised 
18. The gel in the gel–RNA mix may block the pipette tip. There-
fore, using a sterile blade, cut off the “tip” portion of the 
pipette tip, and use this for pipetting gel–RNA mix. 
19. Optimal RNAse1 digestion conditions may vary for different 
plant tissue, and re-optimization may be needed. For example, 
600 μL of lysate from maize seedling roots was digested with 
1500 U RNase1 at 28 °C for 30 min [20]. To optimize the 
RNase1 digestion condition, titrate lysate volume, units of 
RNase 1, digestion temperature, and duration (as shown in 
Fig. 3) and analyze the sharpness of the band between 28 nt 
and 34 nt. Subsequently, run a small RNA bioanalyzer using 
Agilent bioanalyzer small RNA assay kit to assess the quality of 
the bands (Fig. 3b). 
20. Alkaline hydrolysis and RNase 1 digestion result in RNA frag-
ments with 5′ hydroxyl and 3′ phosphate ends. However, 
adapter ligation for library preparation requires 5′ phosphate 
and 3′ hydroxyl ends. Treat the RNA with T4PNK in the 
absence of ATP dephosphorylates the 3′ end. Subsequently 
incubate with ATP phosphorylates the 5′ end. 
21. For steps A, B, etc., refer to the Steps mentioned in the 
manufacturer’s protocol. 
22. The one-third dilution of adapters was determined empirically 
based on the RNA yield after size selection. Users may need to 
determine the adapter dilution based on their RNA recovery. 
23. Because the input RNA for library preparation was already size-
selected, the bead cleanup after reverse transcription can be

f

conducted with the modiﬁed, more straightforward protocol 
that does not need size selection. The modiﬁed protocol can be 
found on the manufacturer’s website (perkinelmer-
appliedgenomics.com/nextﬂex_small_rna_v3_no_size_selec 
tion_supplement-2/). 
24. The optimal number of PCR cycles needs to be determined 
empirically. Because the reagents in the library preparation kit 
are very limited, we recommend the following approach to 
ensure optimal ampliﬁcation for every library preparation. 
The bead cleanup after reverse transcription yields 18 μL o  
cDNA. 9 μL of this cDNA can be ampliﬁed (Step G) in a 
12.5 μL PCR with 11 cycles, thereby consuming only half the 
volume of PCR reagents and the cDNA. Assessing the PCR 
product can be done by PAGE. If the libraries are overampli-
ﬁed, the remaining 9 μL cDNA can be ampliﬁed with 9 or 
10 cycles. In contrast, if the PCR product is not overampliﬁed 
but after cleanup, the quantity is insufﬁcient for sequencing, 
then the remaining 9 μL cDNA can be ampliﬁed with 12 or 
13 cycles. This approach ensures the libraries are optimally 
ampliﬁed and yield sufﬁcient DNA for sequencing. 
25. The ribo-seq libraries yield fewer reads than RNA-seq libraries, 
for analysis after data processing and ﬁltering steps. Therefore, 
ribo-seq libraries must be sequenced at least twice the depth of 
that of RNA-Seq libraries. We recommend using Illumina 
HiSeq 3000/4000 or NovaSeq 6000 to obtain high sequenc-
ing depth. For example, in ref [38], the libraries were 
sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq platform with S1 ﬂow 
cell (ribo-seq) and SP ﬂow cell (RNA-seq) to obtain ~100 M 
and ~ 50 M raw reads, respectively, per sample. After data 
processing, ncRNA depletion, etc., the yield per sample was 
~20 M reads, each for ribo-seq and RNA-seq data, which 
mapped to the Arabidopsis reference genome. 
26. As of this writing, use Bowtie v.1.2 (parameters: “-v 2”) [25] to  
map the processed data to ncRNA (rRNA, snoRNA, tRNA) 
sequences (TAIR10). Use STAR v.2.5 (parameters: “--outFil-
terMismatchNmax 2 -- outFilterMultimapNmax 1”) to map 
the ncRNA-unaligned reads to the Arabidopsis reference 
genome (TAIR10).

Experimental Transmission of Plant Viruses by Aphids 
or Whiteﬂies 
Irene Ontiveros, Juan Antonio Diaz-Pendo´n, and Juan Jose´ Lo´pez-Moya 
Abstract 
Numerous species of plant viruses are naturally transmitted by insect vectors, mainly homopterans like 
aphids and whiteﬂies. Depending on the vector speciﬁcity and the mode of transmission, different durations 
of the periods for acquisition, retention, and inoculation are required for a successful transmission. 
Therefore, the experimental setup to perform controlled transmission experiments under laboratory con-
ditions involves handling the vector organisms and managing the times for the different steps of the process 
to optimize and standardize the results. This chapter describes some basic procedures that can be applied to 
vector-mediated transmission experiments with selected viruses using aphids or whiteﬂies and different host 
plants. 
Key words Non-persistent transmission, Semipersistent transmission, Circulative transmission, Non-
viruliferous vector, Viruliferous vector, Acquisition, Retention, Inoculation

Introduction 
Plant viruses often rely on vectors as a means of transmission to 
survive in nature. By using vectors, they can reach new susceptible 
hosts where they can continue acting as obligate intracellular para-
sites, making the transmission process one of the most critical steps 
in the viral cycle [1]. Among vectors, phytophagous arthropods 
play an important role in the dissemination of most plant viruses, 
with insect vectors being the most common [2]. Many plant viruses 
are spread from plant to plant by species belonging taxonomically 
to the Homoptera, speciﬁcally the Aphididae (aphids) and Aleyro-
didae (whiteﬂies) families [3–6]. Examples of viruses transmitted by 
aphids are potyviruses, cucumoviruses, caulimoviruses, luteo-
viruses, poleroviruses, alfamoviruses, closteroviruses, and nano-
viruses. In the case of whiteﬂies, examples are begomoviruses, 
criniviruses, ipomoviruses, carlaviruses, and torradoviruses. These 
two insects possess pierce-sucking mouthparts equipped with

stylets that allow them to feed on plant tissues without causing 
signiﬁcant damage, a characteristic that facilitates the establishment 
of new virus infections. The ability of these vectors to form large 
colonies and efﬁciently disperse themselves establishes them collec-
tively as the most signiﬁcant groups of vectors for plant viruses.

Irene Ontiveros et al.
In addition to being an essential step in the cycle of numerous 
viruses, which certainly merits attention from the scientiﬁc commu-
nity [7], there are other compelling reasons to establish protocols 
for conducting controlled vector transmission experiments. Cur-
rently, the rate of discovering new viruses [8] is steadily increasing, 
thanks to the application of powerful genomic tools that often yield 
complete genome sequence data from environmental samples. 
However, it is noteworthy that these sequences frequently lack 
relevant biological information [9]. For numerous newly discov-
ered viruses, there is a lack of knowledge regarding their hosts or 
vector organisms. Consequently, identifying the vector of a new 
virus holds important implications for its precise taxonomical clas-
siﬁcation, as well as for effective management if it will become a 
potential causal agent of new plant diseases threatening crop 
production. 
There are excellent recent reviews that can be consulted for 
details about the relationship between plant viruses and their insect 
vectors [10–13]. Also, in the case of whiteﬂies, basic management 
procedures 
for 
transmission 
have 
been 
described 
recently 
[14]. Mechanistically, the successful transmission of viruses by 
insect vectors requires several steps in the case of insect vectors: 
ﬁrst, the acquisition of virions from an infected plant; second, the 
acquired virions might need to be retained in the vector, either at 
speciﬁc sites through binding to receptor-like elements in the 
digestive tract, or circulating from different anatomical structures, 
mainly from the gut to the salivary glands; and ﬁnally, delivery of 
virions is required, in many cases following salivation, allowing the 
virions to be deposited in a susceptible host plant to start the 
infection. The duration of these steps (acquisition, retention, and 
inoculation) can serve to classify the modes of transmission accord-
ing to the length of the period when the vector keeps the virus 
infectivity. In non-persistent transmission, the insect can transmit 
the virus almost immediately after acquiring it from an infected 
source plant, and the capacity to transmit the virus is lost rapidly, 
often within a few minutes. In contrast, persistent transmission 
requires longer periods of acquisition, often followed by a period 
of retention before the vector ﬁnally becomes viruliferous and can 
transmit the virus. Semipersistent transmission is an additional 
category reserved for viruses with intermediate requirements for 
both acquisition and retention periods. A further reﬁnement of the 
classiﬁcation also considers the route followed by the virus within 
the insect vector, being either non-circulative or circulative trans-
mission. In the non-circulative case, there is only a temporary and

reversible association of the virus with the anterior tract of the 
digestive system (mouthparts or foregut). This type of transmission 
corresponds mainly with non-persistent and semipersistent trans-
mission, in which the virus is not retained for long, and it can be 
immediately released and inoculated, completing the process only 
during short periods of time. Both acquisition and inoculation are 
thought to occur during short feeding probes. Since the non-
persistent transmission occurs within such a narrow timeframe, it 
is indeed difﬁcult to control the spread of these viruses using 
insecticide treatments targeted to kill the vectors. On the other 
hand, circulative transmission requires the passage of virions 
through the insect’s body. They ﬁrst pass through the gut barriers 
to reach the hemolymph and subsequently enter the salivary glands 
to be inoculated during salivation. In this case, the complete pro-
cess might take days and often requires a period of latency since 
immediately after acquisition, the virus cannot be inoculated until 
the completion of its circulation within the vector. Additional 
categories can be established in this case when the virus replication 
only occurs in the plant hosts as non-propagative, being propaga-
tive if the virus is able to replicate as well in the vector. Interestingly, 
propagative viruses are parasites of both plants and insects, alter-
nating between the two types of hosts to complete their cycles of 
dispersion, which could occasionally involve different development 
stages of the insect and even passage to the progenies. 
Experimental Transmission of Plant Viruses by Aphids or Whiteﬂies
167
In this chapter, our focus is on general procedures for testing 
the transmission of plant viruses using the two more common 
vector organisms: aphids and whiteﬂies. Alongside direct plant-to-
plant transmission setups, we describe procedures based on artiﬁcial 
membrane feeding [15, 16], which played a crucial role in identify-
ing auxiliary factor(s) involved in the transmission of certain plant 
viruses [17–19].

Handling of Vectors 
In addition to the biological materials, various devices are necessary 
to conﬁne vectors while feeding during the acquisition and inocu-
lation processes. These devices include the following: 
1. Insect-proof cages (sized appropriately to accommodate plants 
during the acquisition and inoculation periods).

Fig. 1 Devices used for handling insect vectors in virus transmission experiments. The image shows a 
commercial portable insect-proof cage (BugDorm, measuring 47.5 × 47.5 × 47.5 cm) with aphid-infested 
tobacco plants inside (a). The cages are stackable and can be placed in growth chambers (b) for rearing 
different colonies of insects or conducting experiments that require vector conﬁnement. To create small 
membrane feeding chambers, 30-mL tubes (polystyrene containers 25 × 90 mm with polypropylene caps) can 
be employed (c, left) by cutting the bottom and applying black adhesive tape for darkening (c, right). A closer 
look from above shows a cylinder (d) ready to be covered with a stretched paraﬁlm membrane. The same 
tubes can be used to prepare various components for handling whiteﬂies. These include an aspiration device 
(e, left), clip cages that can be attached to tubes (e, center), or other clip cages (e, right, and disassembled in f) 
using two perforated caps glued together in opposing orientations to connect them 
2. Containers and vials for capturing and immobilizing insects 
during fastening. 
3. Paintbrush or aspiration device (see Note 5). 
4. Clip cages (see Note 6). 
5. Membrane feeding chambers prepared using stretched paraﬁlm 
membranes and different feeding solutions (see Note 7). 
Some examples are shown in Fig. 1. 
2.3 
Systems for 
Virus Detection 
To determine the presence of the virus in individual plants follow-
ing transmission, an appropriate diagnostic protocol might be 
needed in advance. The procedure for virus detection can encom-
pass various methods, ranging from simple observations of

symptoms to more advanced molecular techniques such as serolog-
ical methods (ELISA or Western blot), hybridization using speciﬁc 
probes (dot-blot or tissue print), or methods based on PCR ampli-
ﬁcation (for DNA viruses) or RT-PCR (for RNA viruses).

Methods 
All procedures will be conducted using plants and insects relocated 
to the designated area or room where the experiments will take 
place. In general, temperature and illumination should be main-
tained within ranges suitable for plant growth and insect rearing 
unless they need to be intentionally manipulated as variables within 
the experimental design. 
The two primary methods for conducting transmission experi-
ments are plant-to-plant transmission (Fig. 2) and artiﬁcial feeding 
(Fig. 3). These approaches are described in the following 
subsections. 
3.1 
Plant-to-Plant 
Transmission by 
Freely Moving Insect 
Vectors 
This simpliﬁed method involves conﬁning source and destination 
test plants together with potential vectors in a cage. The method 
can be used in studies to determine which insect species are capable 
of transmitting a speciﬁc virus, and it can be complemented by 
additional procedures to conﬁrm unequivocally the identity of the 
vector and gather further information about the duration of the 
various stages of the transmission process. 
1. Enclose infected source plants with test plants within a cage and 
introduce insect vectors at the desired density. The distance 
between the source and destination plants can be regarded as a 
parameter for the assay (see Note 8). 
2. Allow unrestricted movement of vectors between plants, pro-
moting mobility if required, and wait for the completion of the 
different periods for acquisition/inoculation. 
3. Optionally, eliminate vectors through insecticide treatment (see 
Note 9). 
4. Maintain the plants under suitable growing conditions, allow-
ing sufﬁcient time for virus infections to manifest. 
5. Quantify the transmission (rate number of infected plants/ 
total number of test plants) by directly observing symptoms 
or employing a detection system (see Note 10). 
3.2 
Plant-to-Plant 
Transmission Under 
Restricted Mobility 
Conditions of the 
Insect Vectors 
1. Collect insects (see Note 11) in adequate containers and fasten 
them 
during 
a 
period 
determined 
experimentally 
(see 
Note 12). 
2. Allow insects to access the infected plant (either complete or 
detached leaves) for the desired acquisition period (see Note 
13). Alternatively, insects could be reared directly on virus-

Fig. 2 Procedure for conducting plant-to-plant aphid transmission experiments. Apterous adult aphids reared 
on infested plants (a) are carefully collected using a paintbrush (b) and placed in glass vials for a fasting period 
(c). The experimental arena for acquisition consists of a plate covered with wet ﬁlter paper and positioned 
inside a larger plate ﬁlled with soapy water (c). Small susceptible plants (d) are prepared in a tray to receive 
the virus, acquired from a leaf collected from an infected source plant (e). The aphids after fasting are grouped 
by tapping the vials, deposited on the detached infected leaf, and evenly distributed (f, g), with the acquisition 
time measured using a stopwatch (h). To prevent unwanted aphid visits, control plants (negative and positive: 
mock and mechanically inoculated, respectively) are covered with inverted sample tubes (h). Once the 
acquisition period is completed, the aphids are individually transferred to each test plant until the desired 
number of vectors per plant is reached and then covered (i). This process is repeated for all the test plants (j). 
After distributing the aphids, the controls are uncovered, dusted with carborundum (l), and either mock-
inoculated or manually inoculated with a fresh extract of infected tissue (m, n), to be later rinsed and covered 
(o). Upon completion of the inoculation period, the plants are uncovered (p) and sprayed with insecticide (q)  to  
eliminate the vectors. The percentage of transmission is calculated based on the number of infected plants, 
which are diagnosed once the positive control exhibits symptoms or tests positive

Fig. 3 Procedure for conducting membrane feeding transmission experiments. Apterous adult aphids are 
collected and placed for a fasting period, as shown in Fig. 2. In this case, chambers with artiﬁcial membranes 
are prepared using cylindrical section of rigid plastic tubes (polystyrene, diameter 2 cm, height 2.5 cm), and 
the exterior is darkened using black tape. Paraﬁlm is then stretched in two dimensions and tightly wrapped 
around the top of the cylinder to form a membrane (a–c). A 15% sucrose solution is carefully placed on top of 
the membrane (d) and covered with an additional layer of stretched paraﬁlm to create a sachet (e, f). The 
fasting aphids are introduced into the cylinder (g) and allowed to crawl until they reach the membrane 
attracted by the light. To cover the bottom of the chamber, a dark slide is used (h). The aphids can pierce the 
membrane with their stylets to access the sucrose solution, and the acquisition time is measured using a 
stopwatch (i). Once the acquisition period is completed, the cylinder is lifted, and the aphids are individually 
collected using a paintbrush (j). For the inoculation, the aphids are individually transferred to the test plants, as 
shown in Fig. 2 
infected plants, therefore being already viruliferous at the time 
of collection, and consequently, this second step could be 
skipped. 
3. Transfer insects to the test plants (see Note 14) and allow them 
to feed during the required inoculation period. For small 
plants, they can be individually covered with a containment 
cage such as an inverted beaker, while for larger plants, the 
restriction of mobility can be achieved using clip cages or by 
bagging the leaf or branch where the inoculation feeding will 
take place. 
4. Uncover plants (or remove clip cages or bags) and eliminate 
vectors with insecticide treatment (optional). 
5. Maintain the plants under suitable growing conditions, allow-
ing sufﬁcient time for virus infections to manifest. 
6. Quantify the transmission (rate number of infected plants/ 
total number of test plants) by directly observing symptoms 
or employing a detection system.

3.3 
Transmission 
After Virus Acquisition 
Through Artiﬁcial 
Feeding 
1. Collect non-viruliferous insects in adequate containers and 
fasten them during a period determined experimentally. 
2. Prepare artiﬁcial membranes with stretched paraﬁlm (see Note 
15) and the solutions to be tested (see Note 16). 
3. Transfer the insects to the feeding chambers and allow them to 
feed through the paraﬁlm on the solution containing the tested 
components. This can be done either in a single feeding, using 
individual components or mixes of different elements to be 
tested, or in sequential steps to provide each component in 
the desired order (see Subheading 3.4). The insects should 
have access to the virus preparation during the acquisition 
period as determined for the assay. 
4. Transfer insects to the test plants and allow them to feed during 
the required inoculation period. 
5. Uncover plants (or remove clip cages or bags, in case these were 
used) 
and 
eliminate 
vectors 
with 
insecticide 
treatment 
(optional). 
6. Maintain the plants under suitable growing conditions, allow-
ing sufﬁcient time for virus infections to manifest. 
7. Quantify the transmission (rate number of infected plants/ 
total number of test plants) by directly observing symptoms 
or employing a detection system. 
3.4 
Sequential 
Feeding Experiments 
The processes of acquisition and inoculation can be divided into 
distinct sub-periods to carry out sequential feeding on various plant 
tissues and/or artiﬁcial membranes. This approach allows for 
reﬁnement in the design of targeted experiments (see Note 17).

Notes 
1. Before most types of transmission experiments, the virus infec-
tion might need to be initiated in hosts that will be used as a 
transmission source. This usually involves mechanical inocula-
tion for certain viruses, rubbing manually an extract on leaves 
dusted with an abrasive (such as carborundum). Buffers to 
prepare crude extracts should be consulted in the relevant 
literature for each speciﬁc virus, but also examples for many 
viruses can be found in the dedicated database of “Description 
of plant viruses” available online at https://www.dpvweb.net/ 
[20]. For other viruses, live inocula might be needed and 
preserved through vegetative propagation or even through 
vector transmission. Finally, puriﬁed virions could be used in 
artiﬁcial membrane feeding for virus acquisition, either alone 
or assisted by auxiliary factors.

Experimental Transmission of Plant Viruses by Aphids or Whiteﬂies

2. Virus-free seed stocks or other uninfected sources of propa-
gules are a good system to initiate the growth of experimental 
plants. To exclude undesired visits of potential vectors, con-
ﬁnement in growth chambers or greenhouses will be desirable, 
or alternatively, the use of insect-proof cages (see Fig. 1) might 
be required during the whole cultivation cycle. Updated and 
valuable resources about handling plants for experiments with 
pathogens and pests can be found in the relevant literature and 
dedicated collections and databases, for instance at the 
European and Mediterranean Plant Pathology Organization 
(EPPO) website https://gd.eppo.int/ (Guidelines for the pro-
duction of biological reference material. EPPO Bull, 51: 
499–506. https://doi.org/10.1111/epp.12781). 
3. Laboratory-established colonies (such as clonal parthenoge-
netic aphids and progenies populations of individually selected 
male and female whiteﬂies) are generally better than heteroge-
neous colonies or wild-captured individuals, which can carry 
other pathogens and might require to perform quarantine/ 
acclimation periods before their use as vectors. Depending on 
the virus under study and the host range, a cautionary principle 
to avoid contaminations will be to rear insects in a non-host 
plant for the virus, although such a possibility might not always 
be available. As a general principle, different rooms or chamber 
facilities would serve to keep the insects separated from the 
experimental plants until the setting up of the transmission 
experiments. As in the case of biological materials, information 
on insect vectors can be found at EPPO, for instance, about 
whiteﬂies (Bemisia tabaci. EPPO Bulletin, 34: 281–288. 
https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2338.2004.00729.x), 
and 
at a dedicated website of the French Institute of Agricultural 
Research INRAE (https://www6.inrae.fr/encyclopedie-
pucerons_eng/). 
4. Proper management of plant host and insect vectors is essential 
for successful transmission experiments. Both plants and insects 
are living organisms, and their susceptibility and performance 
can be inﬂuenced by environmental conditions and even circa-
dian rhythms. Also, the inﬂuence of insect behavior needs to be 
considered [21]. As a rule, repetitions of the experiments must 
be performed at similar times of the day and in a comparable 
environment. If possible, controlled light and temperature 
conditions could be preferred to standardize the repetitions. 
In practical terms, a record of the conditions during each 
repetition should be kept for future reference and statistical 
treatment of the data. 
5. To preserve their behavioral capacities, insect individuals must 
be handled carefully, keeping tools clean and minimizing the 
force required to remove them from the rearing plant. This 
involves gently collecting them using a ﬁne paintbrush or

174
Irene Ontiveros et al.
aspiration devices. An example of a home-made design for a 
collection device is shown in Fig. 1c, which uses a commercial 
sample tube (30 mL, cylindrical with conical bottom and screw 
cap) prepared using two silicon ﬂexible thin hoses that pass 
through perforated holes in the cap of a tube and, therefore, 
can be screwed into different collecting tubes. One of the hoses 
is open and can be attached to a pipette tip to concentrate 
the aspiration, while the second hose should be connected to 
the vacuum source outside and covered with a ﬁne mesh inside 
the device to avoid losing insects when the vacuum is applied. 
Holes for passing the two hoses through the container cap 
must be sealed to avoid leaks and consequently create a nega-
tive pressure in the tube for the suction of the insects. 
6. Clip cages should be constructed using an openable hatch that 
could be clamped onto a leaf while maintaining moderate 
pressure to prevent insects from escaping, for example, using 
soft ring pads to avoid pressure damage on the leaf surface. To 
facilitate the transfer of insects, tubes of the same model as the 
ones used for the collection of vectors can be transformed. The 
construction involves ﬁrst cutting the base of the tube to allow 
gluing and securing the hatch clamp, leaving the original 
screw-on cap on the other side of the cage to conﬁne the 
insects, allowing ventilation through a mesh-covered opening. 
Additionally, this design can serve to transfer insects from the 
collection tube using a connector formed by two opposite caps, 
glued and perforated, to communicate two compatible tubes 
(Fig. 1f). 
7. Under certain circumstances, puriﬁed virus particles and auxil-
iary factors can be supplied to the vectors using artiﬁcial feed-
ing (see Fig. 3). For pierce-sucking insects, membranes can be 
prepared using stretched paraﬁlm membranes placed above a 
darkened cylinder where the insects have been previously 
placed. The solution for feeding consists of an artiﬁcial diet 
placed either in a sandwich of two membranes forming a sachet 
(Fig. 3a–f), or above a single membrane with a spacer and a 
cover. 
8. For the most straightforward transmission experiment conﬁn-
ing together infected and test plants with the vector, negative 
control of a similar cage without including insects must be 
considered to rule out the possibility of other vector organisms 
acting regardless of the presence of the presumed vector. This is 
particularly important when testing viruses collected directly 
from ﬁeld samples that might carry unidentiﬁed pests. Quaran-
tine periods followed by detailed inspection and a few passages 
(if possible) under controlled laboratory conditions should be 
considered. While caging together source and test plants, it is 
advisable to avoid direct contact to preclude other types of

Experimental Transmission of Plant Viruses by Aphids or Whiteﬂies
175
contact-driven transmission. The distances between plants 
must be adjusted previously to account for the ﬂying capac-
ity/other mobility conditions of the insects. 
9. Insecticide treatment are performed once the period of inocu-
lation is ﬁnalized, directly spraying on the plants (Fig. 2q) with 
a commercial product previously tested as effective on the same 
colony of insects. The treatment must be repeated, if necessary, 
especially in the case of whiteﬂies, to avoid the future risk of a 
new generation of vectors coming from eggs laid by females 
during the inoculation period. When the inoculation has been 
restricted to conﬁned areas of leaves, one possibility to avoid 
infestation by next-generation whiteﬂies is to remove the leaves 
used for inoculation once the virus has been able to move to 
other parts of the plant through cell-to-cell and systemic 
movement. 
10. Sampling at different intervals might be required to properly 
detect the presence of the virus after transmission. In case a 
mechanical inoculated control was included during the experi-
ment (Fig. 2l, n), a good indication of the timing of appraisal 
for transmission rates can be deduced. 
11. The stylets of sucking insects, when inserted into plant tissues, 
can be fragile and easily torn inadvertently during collection. In 
the case of actively feeding aphids, gently touching their abdo-
men with the paintbrush (Fig. 2a) activates a reﬂex response 
that rapidly retracts the stylet. This reﬂex can be observed 
through changes in the relative position of the antennae, 
which move from being parallel to the body to going forward 
and touching the surroundings in preparation for walking 
away. Once the antennae move and the aphid begins to ambu-
late, it becomes a safe moment to collect them without causing 
anatomical damage. Similarly, a convenient way to collect 
whiteﬂies is by attracting them to light sources, which can be 
achieved by shading a portion of the rearing boxes and leaving 
only the front part illuminated, or using yellow cards near the 
rearing plant. Both systems can stimulate their ﬂight and facili-
tate their aspiration away from feeding areas on the plant. Once 
collected, whiteﬂies can be transferred between the different 
devices, connecting containers, and even the feeding clip cages 
or artiﬁcial membranes using gentle shaking, tapping, and swift 
movements of the sample tubes by a trained experimenter. 
Alternatively, connecting the different components prepared 
with compatible tube caps can be adopted using glued double 
connectors made with two perforated caps. Small clip cages 
with different designs that can be secured to leaves are good 
systems to allow the feeding of insects only in the selected part 
of the plant where they are conﬁned. In the cases of whiteﬂies 
feeding for sufﬁciently long periods, eggs can be laid by females

176
Irene Ontiveros et al.
on the leaves, and labeling of the temporarily infested leaves 
might be required to facilitate their later removal before the 
hatching without affecting the results. 
12. Keeping the insects isolated from plants for a fasting period 
(around 1 h is often sufﬁcient) might increase their focus on 
feeding when released and might have other positive effects like 
clearance of blocking stuff from hypothetical virus-speciﬁc 
receptors to favor acquisition. The containers used for fasting 
must be dry and with an adequate volume for the number of 
individuals or alternatively sufﬁciently ventilated to avoid suf-
focation in case of too crowded groups; for instance, glass vials 
of about 2–4 mL with tight caps can be used for groups of up 
to 50–100 aphids, which can be collected individually using a 
ﬁne paintbrush (Fig. 2b, c). In the case of whiteﬂies, since they 
are attracted to light sources, covering the cage with an opaque 
fabric material would help move them to a section of the cage 
and facilitate their collection using a device with gentle aspira-
tion. Once collected inside the tubes, the insects can be moved 
to the bottom by gently tapping the vials on the bench or table 
surface. For whiteﬂies, placing the tubes in cold conditions 
(such as on ice) for a few seconds before opening them helps 
to avoid the risk of escape. 
13. Rearing viruliferous vectors (on virus-infected plants) could 
simplify the experimental procedures to proceed directly to 
the inoculation step. In other cases, the acquisition requires 
placing the insect on the virus source. This can be done by 
providing access of insects to the infected plant tissue: In the 
case of wingless aphids, this can be done on detached leaves on 
a petri dish over a wet ﬁlter paper. The petri dish can be placed 
inside a larger plate or tray surrounded with soapy water to 
better conﬁne them and avoid escapes (see Fig. 2h). Aphids can 
also be placed directly on whole infected plants and recovered 
manually later. Since whiteﬂies ﬂy actively, the acquisition can 
be forced on small, clipped cages on infected leaves or released 
inside cages containing the acquisition source. Another system 
adequate for whiteﬂies could be to connect the clip cage used 
for acquisition with a second clip cage for inoculation, creating 
a tunneled bridge that the whiteﬂies can use to move from 
infected to test plants and trimming the leaf section can make it 
easier to dry out and favor the migration of insects. In either 
case, it is important to allow individuals to feed on the infected 
plants for the duration of the acquisition access period. In the 
case of non-persistent viruses and aphid vectors, a stopwatch 
can be used to measure the time (Fig. 1j). Direct observation 
with a magnifying glass or a binocular microscope could reveal 
their behavior during feeding (see comments on Note 10). To 
further investigate feeding behavior, entomological equipment

such as Y-tube olfactometers and colored sticky cards can be 
used to monitor vectors [22]. Additionally, the implementa-
tion of techniques such as wiring individual insects and record-
ing their feeding patterns using an electrical penetration graph 
(EPG) system could provide valuable insights [21]. 
14. Control of temperature can be used to reduce the mobility of 
insects for a while, but with certain time limits to avoid unde-
sired mortality. The collection tubes containing insects can be 
placed momentarily on an ice bucket or left in a cold room for a 
few minutes, right before transferring them to other tubes, clip 
cages, or the membrane feeding chambers. 
15. Artiﬁcial diets containing sugar are more attractive to insects. 
The percentage of sucrose (usually from 10% to 20%) can be 
experimentally optimized to maximize transmission rates in 
preliminary experiments. The diet can be contained in between 
two stretched layers of paraﬁlm forming a sachet and placed at 
one end of a cylindrical chamber made with a short tube 
section (Fig. 3a–f), or for short feeding periods, the solution 
on the paraﬁlm membrane can be covered with a glass cover-
slip, using a plastic ﬂat washer as a spacer. In the case of 
collected whiteﬂies, they can be released through the other 
end of the tube, which would be covered by a ventilated lid 
(such as a perforated cap covered with a ﬁne mesh). In all cases, 
zenithal illumination helps the movement of the insects toward 
the membrane. 
16. The puriﬁcation of virions and auxiliary factors allows combin-
ing them into artiﬁcial diets. The concentrations of the differ-
ent components would need to be established experimentally, 
with expected linearity for a range of the concentrations cho-
sen. Under certain conditions, the transmission percentages of 
serial dilutions can be used to titer the activity of a component 
better than using a concentration measurement. 
17. Sequential feeding serves to identify the requirements of auxil-
iary factors for transmission [18]. The versatile system could 
even combine steps for the acquisition of components tran-
siently expressed in plant tissues and later supplemented with 
membrane feeding on puriﬁed virions [23].

Quantiﬁcation of Plant Virus Seed Transmission Rate 
in Arabidopsis thaliana 
Miriam Gil-Valle, Cristina Sa´ez, Nuria Montes, and Israel Paga´n 
Abstract 
More than 25% of all known plant viruses are transmitted through seeds, which makes this mode of dispersal 
of great importance for plant virus epidemics. Virus detection in seed stocks remains the most frequent 
approach for seed health testing, but current methods are not always standardized and/or do not allow 
analyzing large numbers of seeds. Here, we describe a high-throughput method to quantify plant virus seed 
transmission rate based on classical grow-out tests, which can be applied to widely different viruses and host 
species.

Introduction 
More than 25% of all known plant viruses are vertically transmitted 
from parents to offspring through seeds [1]. This transmission 
mode has a great impact on the epidemiology of these pathogens 
as it allows long-term survival and long-distance dispersal of viruses 
favored by the global trade of seeds. It is also a concern for germ-
plasm banks, as virus infection may compromise seed viability 
[2]. In the laboratory, virus vertical transmission can be of great 
relevance, as it has been recently shown by [3] that seed-
transmitted viruses are widespread in laboratory seed stocks of 
Arabidopsis thaliana (from now on, Arabidopsis), with unpredict-
able consequences in experimental settings. Consequently, the 
methods to detect viral presence in seeds and seedlings, the evalua-
tion of vertical transmission through gametes and embryos and the 
strategies to obtain plant material certiﬁcation are gaining increas-
ing importance [4–6]. 
Conventional techniques have been focused on testing viral 
presence in the whole seed or in seedling batches through

bioassays: Seed and seedling extracts have been used to inoculate 
indicator hosts, and grow-out tests after germination of contami-
nated seeds have been performed to check the development of viral 
symptoms in the seedlings [7]. These approaches present low spec-
iﬁcity, are time- and space-consuming, and require trained specia-
lists to perform inoculation and phenotyping. Imaging techniques 
(for instance, electron, ﬂuorescence, or confocal laser scanning 
microscopy) also allow virus detection in infecting male or female 
gametes, pollen grains, embryos, seeds, and leaf tissues of the 
offspring [8]. Although these methods provide a very detailed 
image of the virus, the high cost of the specialized equipment 
required limits the use of these strategies. In addition, viral titer in 
seeds and seedlings is usually lower than that of parental plant 
tissues 
[9], 
increasing 
the 
difﬁculty 
of 
virus 
visualization. 
Serological-based strategies, such as the enzyme-linked immuno-
sorbent assay (ELISA), have also been commonly used for virus 
detection in seeds/seedlings. ELISA test has high sensitivity and 
can be easily performed in large-scale tests with economical materi-
als, which makes it a versatile technology [1]. However, it requires 
expensive speciﬁc antibodies for each viral species or isolate that 
must avoid cross-reaction with similar proteins of other pathogens 
or of the host plant. Due to the limitations of other methods, 
molecular techniques based on the detection of viral nucleic acids 
have become the most generalized method to assess vertical trans-
mission of plant viruses since they provide the highest detection 
sensitivity and speciﬁcity combined with a relatively fast, cheap and 
easy procedure [10].
182
Miriam Gil-Valle et al.
Although molecular techniques based on the hybridization of 
nucleic acid probes have been used to detect viruses in seeds and 
seedlings, the high detection potential of polymerase chain reaction 
(PCR)-based molecular methodologies is prevailing in studies eval-
uating seed transmission of plant viruses. (RT)-PCR allows the 
ampliﬁcation of low levels of viral RNA/DNA, typical of seeds 
and seedlings, and usually involves simple and fast protocols 
[11]. Moreover, different variants and modiﬁcations of conven-
tional PCR have been developed to detect several viruses at the 
same time in a single reaction (multiplex-PCR) or quantitatively 
determine the viral presence/absence in seeds or seedlings (quanti-
tative PCR, qPCR) [12]. These methods require previous knowl-
edge of the viruses to be detected in order to design speciﬁc 
primers. Although other, more recent, technologies, such as next-
generation sequencing (NGS), offer massive identiﬁcation of 
known and novel viral genomes, they are still highly expensive, 
specialized computational analysis of sequences is required, and 
validation methods need to be improved [13]. Thus, PCR-based 
methods are currently the preferred choice. 
Detection techniques for test seed-transmitted viruses must 
combine effectiveness, accuracy, sensitivity, and reliability along

with the simplicity, rapidity, inexpensive cost, and reproducibility to 
be routinely used [4, 14]. Although PCR-based methods generally 
combine these characteristics, standardized procedures to regulate 
seed trade and screening seed-transmitted viruses are not abundant. 
The International Seed Testing Association has released a few pro-
tocols concerning seed-transmitted virus detection [15], but not all 
of them are intended to be used with seedlings (virus detection in 
seeds does not necessarily entail transmission to the progeny) 
and/or are based on molecular methods. Here, we describe a 
rapid and affordable protocol based on RT-qPCR for the accurate 
detection of seed-transmitted plant viruses in seedlings. This 
method has been developed to detect plant virus transmission in 
Arabidopsis seeds but can be easily adapted to assess a wide range of 
plant species (indeed, we have successfully used it in tomato seeds) 
and virus species.

Methods 
3.1 
Seed 
Germination and 
Seedling Growth 
1. Put the desired number of seeds to be sterilized in a 1.5-mL 
tube with the lid opened (see Note 2). Then, place the tube 
within a vacuum desiccator. We use a borosilicate glass desicca-
tor with a diameter of 26 cm. Next to the seeds, place an open 
bottle with the bleach. Add the HCl and immediately close the 
lid of the desiccator. Put Vaseline in the border of the lid to help 
maintain the vacuum. Allow the sterilization to proceed for 
3.5 h. Afterward, use the vacuum to extract the gasses. Open 
the desiccator lid and close the tubes (Fig. 1a). 
2. In a horizontal laminar ﬂow cabinet, place seeds in a piece of 
sterilized paper, such that they can be easily transferred to the 
MS medium (Fig. 1b). Then, move them to Petri dishes con-
taining MS seed germination medium. Handle seeds with a 
sterilized wooden toothpick to place them in the desired posi-
tion. To do so, wet the tip of the toothpick in the MS medium 
to help the seed attach to the toothpick (Fig. 1c). Placing 
around 50–100 seeds per dish allows enough separation 
between seedlings after germination to facilitate collection. 
Then, close the plates with 3M Micropore® tape (Fig. 1d). 
3. Cover the plates with an aluminum foil to maintain seeds in 
darkness (Fig. 1e) and place them at 4 °C for 4–7 days to allow 
seed stratiﬁcation (see Note 3).

4. Remove the aluminum foil and move the Petri dishes to a plant 
growth chamber at 22 °C and 70% relative humidity under 16 h 
of light (intensity: 120–150 mol · m-2 · s). 
5. After 7–10 days, the plateau of seed germination is reached in 
most Arabidopsis ecotypes (Fig. 1f)  (see also Note 4). Collect 
seedlings at this point with dissecting forceps and place them in 
1.5-mL tubes (Fig. 1g). Seedlings can be collected in pools that 
are further analyzed as a single sample to save time and 
resources. Place all seedlings of the same pool in the same 
tube (see Note 5 for indications about pool size) and freeze 
samples in liquid nitrogen (Fig. 1h). Other, more complex 
pooling strategies can also be utilized in some circumstances 
(see Note 6 for the description of alternative strategies). The 
process can be stopped at this point if necessary. When doing 
so, samples can be kept at -80 °C with no loss in total plant 
RNA yield. Otherwise, move to Subheading 3.2.

3.2 
Plant Total RNA 
Extraction 
1. Grind plant tissue to a powder using a plastic micropestle or 
glass beads and a shaker (Fig. 1i). Then, add 600 μL of phenol-
based reagent (e.g., NZYol® , TRIzol® ) and shake for 15 s. This 
volume of phenol-based reagent ensures extracting enough 
total plant RNA for virus detection regardless of the number 
of plants in the pool. Leave for 5 min at room temperature. 
2. Add 200 μL of chloroform and shake for 15 s. Leave for 5 min 
at room temperature. After this point, samples must be kept in 
ice as much as possible to prevent RNA degradation. 
3. Centrifuge the samples for 15 min at 12,000 g and 4 °C. Move 
the supernatant to a clean tube. 
4. Add 2.5 volumes (here, 500 μL) of 2-propanol to the superna-
tant and keep 20–30 min at -20 °C. Then, centrifuge 10 min 
at 12,000 g and 4 °C. 
5. Discard the supernatant and add 600 μL of 70% ethanol. Then, 
centrifuge 5 min at 7,500 g and 4 °C, and discard the superna-
tant. Let the pellet dry for 5 min and then resuspend in 30 μL 
of deionized water. 
6. Use 1 μL to quantify RNA concentration in a spectrophotom-
eter. Usual yield is about 200 ng/μL. Run 200 ng of RNA 
(typically, 1 μL) in a 1.2% agarose gel to check RNA integrity 
(see Fig. 2 for an example of RNA extracts obtained with this 
protocol). 
3.3 
Virus Detection 
in RNA Extracts 
1. Use 50 ng of total plant RNA for virus detection. To do so, 
dilute samples to a concentration of 25 ng/μL and use 2 μL. 
Prepare sample duplicates (see Note 7). 
2. Together with 2 μL of total plant RNA, add (per sample): 
– 5 μL of q-PCR kit AGILENT Brilliant III Ultra-Fast SYBR 
Green QRT-PCR Master Mix to perform the RT and the 
qPCR in one step. The protocol also works with Takara One 
Step TB Green™ PrimeScript™ RT-PCR Kit II master mix 
(Takara Bio Inc.) and can be easily adapted to similar kits 
from other brands. 
– 0.1 μL of DTT (100 mM). 
– 20 U of the ribonuclease inhibitor. 
– Speciﬁc primers at a ﬁnal concentration of 0.2 mM (see Note 
8 on primers design). 
3. Perform the ampliﬁcation in a thermocycler. We typically use a 
LightCycler 480 II real-time PCR system (Roche) (see Note 9). 
4. To attain virus RNA quantiﬁcation, add internal standards (see 
Note 10).

different pool sizes (n = 1, 2, 5, and 10) obtained with the protocol described 
here. In all cases, 200 ng of total plant RNA was loaded into the gel (stained with 
RedsafeTM ) 
5. Run RT-qPCR products in a 2% agarose gel at 90–100 V using 
2 μL of the ampliﬁcation product of puriﬁed viral RNA to check 
that an amplicon of the expected size is obtained.

Notes 
1. If components of the medium are correctly weighted, pH will 
be between 5 and 5.2, so minor adjustments will be needed. If 
seeds are expected to be difﬁcult to germinate (because of 
genotype-speciﬁc 
characteristics 
or 
age), 
gibberellic 
acid 
(GA4 + 7) at a ﬁnal concentration of 5 μM can be added to 
the MS medium. 
2. To successfully sterilize the total amount of seeds, the tube 
volume ﬁlled by seeds must not exceed one-tenth of the total 
tube volume. 
3. Best results are obtained using 3- to 6-month-old seeds. Youn-
ger seeds may still retain some primary dormancy that prevents 
germination. This problem rarely occurs with typical “labora-
tory” genotypes such as Col-0 or Ler, but is much more 
common in other Arabidopsis genotypes, particularly in those 
collected in the ﬁeld or derived from ﬁeld-collected plants (e.g., 
NASC Iberian collection). Stratiﬁcation helps to break dor-
mancy and synchronize germination. If fresh seeds are used 
and the germination rate is low, increasing the stratiﬁcation 
time may increase the germination rate.

188
Miriam Gil-Valle et al.
4. In short-lived Arabidopsis genotypes, the maximum germina-
tion rate is reached after 5–6 days. However, some accessions, 
particularly long-lived ones, may need up to 10 days to reach 
the germination plateau. In Fig. 3, a time course of germina-
tion rates between 1 and 10 days post-stratiﬁcation is repre-
sented for seeds of 10 different Arabidopsis genotypes, which 
include short-lived ones such as An-1, Cen-1, Fei-0, Ler and 
Ver-5 and long-lived ones such as Cad-0, Cdm-0, Cum-0, 
Kas-0, and Ll-0. Data on the life span of these plant genotypes 
can be found in [16, 17]. 
5. When samples are pooled, detection results reﬂect the number 
of positive pools rather than the number of seedlings testing 
positive. Therefore, pooling does not allow a direct quantiﬁca-
tion of virus seed transmission rate, and a likelihood function 
must be applied to estimate the number of positive seedlings 
per pool. As seed transmission is a binomial event, and in most 
Arabidopsis genotypes it happens at a low frequency [18], the 
likelihood of more than one seedling of the same pool being 
infected 
can 
be 
inferred 
using 
a 
Poisson 
distribution 
[19]. Hence, the seed transmission rate can be estimated fol-
lowing the equation: p = 1 – (1 – Y/N)1/k , where p is the 
probability of virus transmission by a single seed, y is the 
number of positive samples (positive pools), n is the total 
number of samples assayed (number of pools), and k is the 
number of seedlings per sample (pool). It is important to 
note that the accuracy of the estimate, particularly at higher 
seed transmission rates, depends on the following: (i) the num-
ber of analyzed seedlings, (ii) the number of seedlings per pool, 
and (iii) the seed transmission rate of the virus. Figure 4 shows 
simulations of seed transmission rates estimated using the 
equation deﬁned above as a function of the pool size and the 
observed seed transmission rate (that is, the seed transmission 
rate calculated by analyzing each seedling independently: pool 
size = 1). In the simulations, the total number of analyzed 
seedlings (n = 100) was maintained constant as this is enough 
for a meaningful estimate. Simulations show that seed trans-
mission estimates are accurate regardless of the pool size as far 
as seed transmission remains low (below 20%), and reducing 
pool size to increase accuracy is only advisable if higher seed 
transmission rates are expected. At high transmission rates, 
accuracy is highly reduced. For instance, for a pool size of 
5, seed transmission rates between 60% and 100% cannot be 
distinguished. In this case, reducing pool size is mandatory. 
6. When a large number of seedlings needs to be analyzed, a 
two-dimensional pooling strategy can be applied to reduce 
the time and cost of the process [20]. Brieﬂy, RNA extracts 
are arranged into 12 by 12 matrices and then pooled by row

Quantiﬁcation of Plant Virus Seed Transmission Rate

Fig. 3 Percent germination between 1 and 10 days post-stratiﬁcation of seeds from 10 Arabidopsis genotypes. 
Genotypes are An-1 (Antwerp, Belgium), Cen-1 (Centenera, Spain), Fei-0 (Santa Maria da Feira, Portugal), Ler 
(Landsberg, Poland), and Ver-5 (Verı´n, Spain), which are short-lived; and Cad-0 (Candelario, Spain), Cdm-0 
(Caldas de Miravete, Spain), Cum-0 (Cumbres Mayores, Spain), Kas-0 (Kashmir, India), and Ll-0 (Llagostera, 
Spain), which are long-lived. Data are mean ± standard error of three replicates 
and by column. The pooling of RNA extracts is carried out in a 
two-dimensional fashion, such that each RNA extract is present 
in exactly one row pool and exactly one column pool. Then, 
virus detection is performed as described in Subheading 3.3. 
This strategy works optimally when the analyzed trait occurs at 
low frequency, as is the case of Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) 
seed transmission in Arabidopsis for most plant genotypes 
[21]. Nevertheless, there is always a certain percentage of 
indetermination. In that case, the RNA extracts in the prob-
lematic rows/columns are analyzed individually. 
7. Although including duplicates increases the time and resources 
devoted to the detection, it also increases the accuracy of the 
detection as it allows the validation of positive and negative 
samples. It also allows the detection of doubtful samples where 
only one of the two replicates is positive and the other is not. 
This may be due to the following: (i) Ampliﬁcation does not 
always happen because the amount of viral RNA in the sample 
is near the detection limit, or (ii) the positive duplicate is 
contaminated during the ampliﬁcation process. To resolve 
this indetermination, detection in these samples can be 
repeated with twice more total plant RNA than in the initial 
detection. 
8. For RT-qPCRs, speciﬁc primers should be designed to amplify 
short fragments (50–200 nt). As an example, primers to detect

Fig. 4 Comparison of observed virus seed transmission rate with estimations 
derived using the equation p = 1 – (1 – Y/N)1/k , where p is the probability of virus 
transmission by a single seed, y is the number of positive samples (positive 
pools), n is the total number of samples assayed (number of pools), and k is the 
number of seedlings per sample (pool). Estimations were done for three different 
pool sizes: k = 2 (blue), k = 5 (yellow), and k = 10 (red). Estimations were done 
for observed transmission rates ranging between 0% and 100%, with 10 pooling 
replicates per observed seed transmission rate value. Each dot represents one of 
these replicates 
Turnip mosaic virus (TuMV) in seedlings consisted of an 18 nt 
forward primer (5′-TGTTCGGCTTGGATGGAA-3′) and a 
21 nt reverse primer (5′- TTAACGTCCTCGGTCGTATGC-
3′) (nucleotide positions 9515–9586 as in Acc. N. AB194802) 
that amplify a 70 nt fragment of the virus coat protein gene. On 
the other hand, primers to detect CMV in seedlings consisted 
of
a
20
nt
forward
primer
(5′-
-GAACAGTTTCCACTGATGCT-3′) and a 20 nt reverse 
primer (5′- ATAGGACAATCATACGTCGG-3′) (nucleotide 
positions 409–563 as in Acc. N. D10538) that amplify a 
154 nt fragment of the movement protein gene. 
9. Reverse transcription is typically carried at 50 °C for 10′, fol-
lowed by 5″ of denaturation at 95 °C. For the qPCR, 40 cycles

of ampliﬁcation are run, consisting of 10″ of denaturation at 
95 °C and 10″ (for TuMV) or 20″ (for CMV) of ampliﬁcation 
at 60 °C for each cycle. Fluorescence quantiﬁcation is done at 
this point. The products are denatured again at 95 °C for 30″ 
and cooled down to 60 °C for 1′. Melting curves are calculated 
by gradually increasing the temperature until reaching 95 °C. 
Extending the qPCR to 40 cycles ensures a maximum detec-
tion rate, as one should bear in mind that the virus load in 
germinated seedlings is very low. For the same reason, it is not 
infrequent that a certain proportion of positive samples amplify 
late during the qPCR (cycles 30–35). We have validated these 
late positives by detecting the virus in the same samples via 
standard PCR with the same primers and further Sanger 
sequencing, such that these late amplicons are not false 
positives. 
10. Absolute viral RNA accumulation (measured as nanograms of 
viral RNA per microgram of total plant RNA) can be quantiﬁed 
by utilizing internal standards. Internal standards consist of 
two-fold dilution series of genomic puriﬁed viral RNA, ranging 
from 50 ng to 0.003 ng. Plasmids in which the fragment to be 
ampliﬁed is cloned can also be used to build internal standards. 
Keep in mind that the dilution series must be done using RNA 
extracts from no-infected seedlings rather than water to 
homogenize the background. Because virus load in seedlings 
is low, if desired the internal standard series can be shortened 
by starting the dilutions at 12.5 ng. Ct values obtained for each 
sample can be interpolated in the Ct to RNA quantity regres-
sion constructed with the internal standards.

Protein–Protein Interaction via Two-Hybrid Assay in Yeast 
Christiane Eliza Motta Duarte and Nivea Costa Euclydes 
Abstract 
The yeast two-hybrid assay enables detecting interactions between proteins, which makes this tool of 
particular interest for plant–virus interaction studies. Basically, the reporter gene expression (HIS3) is  
activated by the binding of a transcription factor GAL4, which, like eukaryotic transcription factors, is 
modular in nature and consists of two structurally independent domains: DNA-binding (DB) and activa-
tion (AD) domains. The two proteins under investigation are expressed separately, one fused to the BD 
domain and the other to the AD domain. In the yeast strain AH109, activation of the reporter gene occurs 
only in cells that contain interacting proteins, reconstituting the transcription factor GAL4 which then 
binds to the responsive promoter and results in yeast colony growth.

Introduction 
The yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) system is a widespread technique due 
to the relative ease and speed of detecting interactions between two 
proteins. Additionally, it offers numerous advantages compared to 
traditional biochemical methods. Y2H avoids costly protein puriﬁ-
cation or antibody development, leading to a substantial time 
reduction required to identify new protein partners [1]. This tech-
nique was developed by Fields and Song (1989) to identify binary 
protein–protein interactions [2] and has been considered the most 
widely utilized approach to identify protein–protein interactions 
[3]. Y2H is based on the modular nature of eukaryotic transcription 
factors, which are made up of two distinct domains: the 
DNA-binding domain (BD) that interacts with DNA and the acti-
vation domain (AD), which recruits the transcriptional machinery 
to initiate transcription on target promoters [2]. The system is 
composed of a plasmid encoding a fusion protein to the BD 
domain, a second plasmid containing another fusion protein to 
the AD domain, and a genetically modiﬁed yeast containing a

reporter gene activated by the GAL4 transaction factor [4]. The 
separated BD and AD domains are not fully functional but can 
reconstitute the transcription factor activity through noncovalent 
interactions between two fusion proteins coexpressed in yeast cells. 
The expression of a reporter gene is activated if the domains are 
kept in proximity, allowing the yeast cell to grow on a speciﬁc 
selective medium [5] (See Fig. 1a, b). For the AH109 strain, the 
reporter gene is HIS3. This strain, a derivative of PJ69-2A, also has 
the ADE2 and MEL1 reporter genes. The three reporter genes are 
under the control of distinct GAL4 upstream activating sequences 
(UASs) and TATA boxes, thereby minimizing the occurrence of 
false positives [6].

The yeast two-hybrid technology can identify new protein 
interactions, conﬁrm suspected interactions, and deﬁne interaction 
domains [7]. The most extensively used experimental approaches 
for 
identifying 
virus–host 
protein 
interactions 
include 
yeast 
two-hybrid and afﬁnity puriﬁcation–mass spectrometry, which 
together account for more than 90% of the information accessible 
in public databases [8]. 
Y2H has also been applied to identify plant–virus protein inter-
actions [9]. Several studies have used Y2H to detect interactions 
between viral and host proteins. Here are few examples: The coat 
protein (CP) of the turnip crinkle virus interacts with a member of 
the NAC family of proteins that participate in plant development 
and defense processes [10]. The silencing suppressor protein 
HcPro 
interacts 
with 
the 
calmodulin-like 
protein 
rgs-CaM 
[11]. Y2H screening of the tobacco mosaic virus replicase protein 
identiﬁed interaction with an ATPase protein and a subunit of the 
photosystem II complex [12]. The interaction between the AL2 
protein of tomato golden mosaic virus, also called transcriptional 
activator protein (TrAP), with SNF1-kinase [13], and the interac-
tion between a tomato NAC protein and the viral protein replica-
tion enhancer protein (Ren) from the tomato leaf curl virus [14] 
were also detected by Y2H. A novel receptor-like protein kinase 
NSP-interacting kinase (NIK) that interacts with a geminivirus 
nuclear shuttle protein (NSP) was discovered by yeast two-hybrid 
screening [15, 16]. Y2H has also found the following cellular 
partners 
of 
NSP: 
NSP-associated 
kinase 
(NsAK) 
[17], 
NSP-interacting GTPase (NIG) [18], and NSP-interacting syn-
taxin domain-containing protein (NISP) [19]. The movement pro-
tein (MP) from the cabbage leaf curl virus (CabLCV) and squash 
leaf curl virus has been shown to interact with synaptotagmin A 
(SYTA), an endosomal plant protein [20], and MP from the abuti-
lon mosaic virus has been discovered as a possible binding partner 
for Arabidopsis thaliana’s chaperone heat shock cognate 70 kDa 
protein (cpHSC70-1) [21]. 
In addition to detecting new interactions by two-hybrid library 
screenings, the two-hybrid protein–protein interaction (PPI) assay

has often been used to conﬁrm interactions identiﬁed via other 
in vitro PPI assays. A PPI network between the MP and NSP 
from the begomoviral CabLCV and Arabidopsis host proteins has 
been revealed using an in situ synthesized nucleic acid programma-
ble protein array (NAPPA) [19]. The Y2H was used to conﬁrm that 
NSP, but not MP, interacts speciﬁcally with NISP. We also show 
here by two-hybrid that the host protein At4G14560, a key regu-
lator of auxin-modulated gene expression, interacts with both MP

Fig. 1 One fragment of the GAL4 transfactor, which is modular, is fused to a protein X, and the other fragment 
is fused to a protein Y. If fusion proteins X and Y do not interact when co-expressed in yeast, there is no 
reconstitution of the transfactor, and the yeast that is auxotroph for histidine does not grow on triple-dropout 
selective medium. On the other hand, if the interaction occurs, the transfactor is reconstituted, recovering its 
activity, which activates the expression of the HIS3 reporter gene resulting in yeast colony growth (a). 
Illustrative scheme of combinations: the X and Y proteins must be fused to the BD and AD domains. If X is 
BD-fused, it must be combined with the empty AD vector and AD-fused Y protein. The reverse combination will 
have protein X AD-fusion, Y fused to BD, and negative controls. Negative control strains must contain the 
empty vector for the BD domain and the target vector expressing a protein fused to AD and vice versa, in 
addition to the combination of both the empty AD and BD vectors. A positive control can be a combination of 
proteins whose interaction has already been documented. In all combinations, the ﬁrst drop from left to right 
has OD600 = 1, and the subsequent two drops are culture dilutions at 10 and 100X. This same scheme should 
be reproduced on SD-Leu-Trp-His plates with and without 3-AT and in one SD-Leu-Trp plate that will be a 
positive control for the presence of both plasmids. These negative combinations should be done on the same 
day as the transactivation assay (b). The ﬁgure was created with BioRender.com

and NSP (Fig. 2), conﬁrming another relevant result from the 
protein microarray.

Fig. 2 Yeast cells co-transformed with the indicated constructs were evaluated 
for their histidine prototrophy by being plated on a selective medium deﬁcient in 
leucine, tryptophan, and histidine, supplemented with 2.5 mM 3 AT. At4G14560, 
a key regulator of auxin-modulated gene expression, interacts with the viral 
proteins MP and NSP. Co-expression of AD-At4G14560 + BD-NSP and 
AD-MP + BD-At4G14560 promoted histidine prototrophy on a medium lacking 
histidine and supplemented with 3AT 
Moreover, Y2H has uncovered other signiﬁcant interactions, 
such as protein–protein interactions that occur between host pro-
teins and are relevant to the viral infection process: (i) LIMYB 
(L10-interacting Myb domain-containing protein) and ribosomal 
protein L10 (RPL10) [16]; (ii) WW domain-containing protein 
(AtWWP1) and NIG [22]; and (iii) NIK1 with brassinosteroid 
insensitive 1-associated kinase 1 (BAK1) and ﬂagellin sensing 
2 (FLS2) [23]. The receptor NIK1 inversely modulates antiviral 
and antibacterial immunity in plants [23]. Upon viral infection, the 
NIK1-mediated antiviral signaling pathway mediates phosphoryla-
tion of the ribosomal protein RPL10, which then translocates into 
the nucleus and interacts with LIMYB to suppress the expression of 
genes involved in translation, which culminates with global transla-
tional suppression [16]. Without pathogen invasion, autoimmunity

is prevented by NIK1 interaction with BAK1 or FLS2 [23]. Another 
defense mechanism against viral infection is mediated by WWP1, 
which confers resistance to begomoviruses by sequestering NIG 
into nuclear bodies. NIG facilitates the nuclear export of the 
NSP-DNA complex. AtWWP1 interacts with NIG and conﬁnes it 
within nucleus, preventing its association with NSP [22]. The asso-
ciation of LIMYB and RPL10, WWP1 and NIG, and NIK1 with 
BAK1 or FLS2 was identiﬁed by two-hybrid assay. These examples 
reinforce the applicability of Y2H in screening protein–protein 
interactions, including the detection of host proteins that play an 
important role throughout viral infection.

The chapter presented here describes the main procedures for 
using the GAL4-based Y2H system and is subdivided into 4 sec-
tions: ﬁrst and second transformations (which alternatively can be 
performed 
simultaneously), 
transactivation 
assay, 
and 
self-
activation testing, besides a protocol for yeast protein extraction 
for fusion protein expression conﬁrmation. 
Another illustrative example of the Y2H assay is shown in 
Fig. 
3. 
Methyl-CpG-binding 
domain-containing 
protein 
2 (MBD2) from Arabidopsis was fused to the AD domain, and 
the viral coat protein AV1, from the CabLCV, was fused to the BD 
domain. The HIS3 reporter gene was neither activated in yeast cells 
co-transformed with these constructions nor with the reciprocal 
empty vector combinations. The interaction between the host pro-
teins AtWWP1 and the Pro-rich domain of NSP-interacting gua-
nosine triphosphatase (PRNIG) was also evaluated by Y2H 
[22]. AH109 is unable to synthesize histidine; however, if there is 
an interaction between the tested proteins, histidine prototrophy is 
restored and the cells grow in selective medium deﬁcient in histi-
dine. Co-expression of BD-PRNIG fusion and AD-WWP1 fusion 
promoted histidine prototrophy in the presence of 3-amino-1,2,4-
triazole (3AT), a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme HIS3 
(imidazoleglycerol-phosphate dehydratase), which acts by reducing 
background growth, allowing a more straightforward distinction 
between background and positive colonies [7] (Fig. 3a). The inter-
action between NIG and WWP1, initially identiﬁed via yeast 
two-hybrid screen with a cDNA library from Arabidopsis thaliana 
aerial tissues, was conﬁrmed through Y2H analysis. This interaction 
may interfere with the NIG pro-viral function, as WWP1 is able to 
reallocate NIG to nuclear bodies [22]. 
Accumulation of AD-AtWWP1, AD-MBD2, BD-PRNIG, and 
BD-AV1 proteins in yeast was evaluated by Western blot, using 
speciﬁc antibodies for the BD and AD domains (Fig. 3b). Western 
blots are especially important when positive interactions are not 
detected, such as AD-AtMBD2 + BD-AV1. Western blot validation 
demonstrates that the fusion proteins are stably expressed in yeast 
and conﬁrms that the failure to display His prototrophy is due to 
the lack of protein interactions.

Methods 
3.1 
First 
Transformation 
1. Scrape frozen glycerol stock the AH109 yeast with a sterile 
toothpick or bacteriological needle, and incubate in 3–5 mL  
YPDA medium. To disperse cell clumps, vigorously vortex the 
cultures for 0.5–1 min. From this pre-inoculum, obtain fresh 
cultures as they result in better transformation efﬁciency. 
2. Centrifuge the conic tubes at 3000 g for 5 min at room 
temperature. 
3. Remove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 1 mL of 
sterile distilled water. Transfer to 1.5-mL microtubes. 
4. Centrifuge again at 3000 g for 5 min at room temperature. 
5. Discard the supernatant (by gently inverting the tube) and 
resuspend the pellet in 500 μL of 100 mM lithium acetate 
(freshly made from the 1 M stock solution). 
6. Centrifuge at 13,000 g for 1 min at room temperature. Discard 
the supernatant, eliminating as much liquid as possible using a 
micropipette. Cells are now ready for the transformation step. 
7. Add the following components to the yeast pellet in that order: 
240 μL PEG 3350 50% (viscous solution, aspirate slowly with 
the micropipette) 
36 μL of 1 M lithium acetate 
25 μL of salmon sperm (2 mg/mL), previously boiled for 
5 min and immediately cooled on ice. 
500–1000 ng of plasmid DNA with the construct of interest 
cloned into pDEST 32 or pDEST22 (only one plasmid 
type per transformation). 
(See Note 6). 
8. Use a micropipette to resuspend the cells thoroughly and then 
vortex the tubes. Incubate the tubes for 30 min at 30 °C in  
water or dry bath. 
9. Incubate tubes for an additional 25 min at 42 °C in a water 
bath or dry bath. 
10. Centrifuge the tubes at 13000 g for 1 min at room tempera-
ture. Remove the supernatant using a micropipette. 
11. Resuspend the pellet in 1 mL of distilled water and centrifuge 
again at 13000 g for 1 min at room temperature. 
12. Remove the supernatant, leaving about 100 μL of liquid this 
time. Resuspend the pellet in this volume of remaining liquid 
with a micropipette. 
13. Spread the cell suspension over the appropriate selective 
medium with the aid of a glass spreader (remember to ﬂame

Two-Hybrid Assay in Yeast
203
the glass spreader and cool it by touching it to the agar along 
the edge near the rim before plating the cells). (See Note 7). 
14. Incubate at 30 °C for 3–5 days. Wait until colonies reach 
1–2 mm in diameter. (See Notes 8 and 9). 
3.2 
Second 
Transformation 
1. The transformation protocol will be the same, except that the 
yeast must now be inoculated into selective media and not 
YPDA. Collect several colonies from the plate obtained in 
step 14 (approximately 10), and incubate them in a liquid 
selective medium corresponding to the vector used in the ﬁrst 
transformation (if pDEST32, SD-Leu medium; if pDEST22, 
SD-Trp medium). To disperse cell clumps, vigorously vortex 
the cultures for 0.5–1 min. Incubate for 16 to 24 h at 30 °C 
with a 220 rpm rotation. 
2. Follow steps 2–12 from Subheading 3.1, but remember that 
the cell must now be transformed with the construct in the 
vector opposite to that of the ﬁrst transformation (e.g., if a 
cloned protein in pDEST32 was used in the ﬁrst transforma-
tion, the second transformation must be with the other protein 
under analysis cloned in pDEST22, and vice versa). Include 
negative and positive controls. Including many controls can 
add conﬁdence to the detected interactions. (See schemes of 
all combinations in Fig. 1b). 
3. After the transformation, spread the cell suspension with a glass 
spreader over the SD-Leu-Trp selective medium since the 
selection 
will 
be 
for 
the 
presence 
of 
both 
vectors 
simultaneously. 
4. Incubate at 30 °C for 3–5 days. Wait until colonies reach 
1–2 mm in diameter. (See Note 10). 
3.3 
Transactivation 
Assay and Self-
Activation Testing 
1. Collect several colonies from step 4, Subheading 3.2 (approxi-
mately 10–15), and incubate them in liquid selective SD-Leu-
Trp medium overnight at 30 °C with 220 rpm rotation. 
2. In the ﬂow hood, remove an aliquot of the culture and read the 
absorbance at 600 nm in a spectrophotometer. To prepare the 
drops, the culture must have reached an OD600 = 1.0. An 
OD600 = 1 equals 1–2 × 107 cells per mL. 
3. Adjust the concentrations of all inoculums to the same absor-
bance reading. If necessary, make dilutions in water or culture 
medium until all are with OD600 = 1.0. 
4. After adjustment to OD600 = 1, make serial dilutions of 
10 and 100X in sterile distilled water for each combination 
(positive control, interaction, negative controls). (See interac-
tion scheme: hypothetical proteins X and Y in Fig. 1b). 
Remember that this entire process needs to be done in the 
laminar ﬂow hood.

5. Drops 
are 
made 
on 
triple-dropout 
selective 
medium 
(SD-Leu-Trp-His) supplemented with different concentrations 
of 3-AT (suggested: 0, 2.5, 5, and 10 mM). The required 
concentration of 3-AT will depend on the auto-activation test 
(see steps 7 and 8). (See Notes 11 and 12). 
6. Leave the plates open in the stream until the water evaporates. 
Seal with plastic wrap and incubate for 3–5 days at 30 °C. 
Photograph the plates, and prepare the ﬁgure with the results. 
(See Note 13). 
7. For self-activation testing, use transformants with an empty 
vector plus a target protein fused to the complementary vector, 
e.g., target protein fused to the BD domain, combined with an 
empty vector containing an AD domain. To measure basal 
HIS3 reporter gene activity, use SD-Leu-Trp-His supplemen-
ted with different concentrations of 3-AT: 0, 1, 2.5, 5, and 
10 mM. 
8. Make the drops in the same as in steps 4–6. Check for the 
lowest concentration of 3-AT at which background colony 
growth is completely blocked. (See Notes 14–16). 
3.4 
Veriﬁcation of 
Protein Expression 
[24]. (See Note 17) 
1. Cultivate yeast cells in 5 mL of appropriate selective medium 
until they reach an OD600 ~ 3 (takes about 3 to 4 days of 
incubation). 
2. Transfer the culture to 2-mL microtubes and pellet the cells by 
centrifuging for 1 min at 14000 g at room temperature. Dis-
card the supernatant. Continue centrifuging the culture in the 
same tube until the entire volume has been centrifuged. 
3. Wash the pellet with 900 μL of water, vortex, and centrifuge 
again 1 min at 14000 g at room temperature, and then discard 
the supernatant. 
4. Suspend the pellet in 400 μL of 12.5% TCA. Freeze samples for 
at least 30 min at -80 °C (we usually leave them overnight). 
Extraction can be stopped at this point, and samples can be 
stored at -80 °C for later use. 
5. Thaw the sample and sediment the cells by centrifuging them 
for 5 min at 14000 g at room temperature. Discard the 
supernatant. 
6. Wash the pellet twice with 500 μL of ice-cold 80% acetone by 
centrifuge or 5 min at 14000 g at room temperature. 
7. Carefully remove the supernatant and let the acetone evaporate 
completely until the pellet is dry. 
8. Solubilize the pellet in 75 μL of 1% SDS/0.1 M NaOH (at this 
stage, the pellet will have a whitish and crumbly appearance).

Two-Hybrid Assay in Yeast
205
9. Add 17 μL of 6X sample buffer (Laemmli buffer). Boil the 
samples for 5 min at 100 °C. 
10. Proceed with the separation of proteins by loading them on a 
standard SDS polyacrylamide gel and transfer the separated 
proteins to a blotting membrane. Use speciﬁc antibodies 
against BD and AD domains for probing.

Notes 
1. Other commercial vectors are also available, such as pGBKT7g 
and pGADT7g, which produce amino-terminal BD and AD 
fusions, respectively. pGBKCg and pGADCg, on the other 
hand, fuse the BD or AD at the carboxyl terminus of the target 
protein. pDEST, pGBKT7g, and pGADT7g vectors are Gate-
way compatible. 
2. The genes of interest must ﬁrst be ampliﬁed using PCR and 
then cloned into yeast expression vectors using either classic 
cloning or recombination methods (e.g., the Gateway system). 
3. The amount of water that must be added to make the glucose 
solution is quite minimal. Slowly pour in the water, being 
careful not to exceed the ﬁnal capacity of 50 mL. It might 
take some time for glucose to dissolve. Continue to stir with 
the magnetic bar until the solubilization is complete. Because it 
causes caramelization of the media when autoclaved combined 
with the other components, the glucose is frequently prepared 
separately (however, it is not essential to do so) and added to 
the other components after autoclaving. 
4. PEG is particularly tough to dissolve. Continue stirring with 
the magnetic bar until the solubilization is complete. Store at 
room temperature with the vial sealed with paraﬁlm to prevent 
evaporation. 
5. Avoid freeze and thaw cycles. It is best to make small aliquots 
from stock and thaw just enough for use. 
6. Because acetate is toxic to cells at high concentrations, adding 
PEG before 1 M lithium acetate is crucial. The PEG will form a 
kind of shield around the cells. 
7. The selective medium will be SD-Trp if the ﬁrst transformation 
is with the pDEST22 vector and SD-Leu if the initial transfor-
mation is with the pDEST32 vector. The TRP1 gene is carried 
via the pDEST22 vector, which allows cells to be selected for 
transformation by growing them on tryptophan-free media. 
The LEU2 gene in pDEST32 permits yeast growth in media 
without leucine to select it.

8. Transformation timing: step 1 takes 12–16 h; steps 2–13 take 
1 h to 1 h 30 min, depending on the number of transforma-
tions performed; and Step 14 takes 3–5 days. It takes at least 
3 days for the transformed yeast to develop colonies appropri-
ate for isolation. 
9. Yeast, transformed or untransformed, can be kept on a solid 
medium at 4 °C for 2–4 weeks before being restreaked. Alter-
natively, yeast strains can be stored indeﬁnitely at -70 °C in  
YPD medium with 25% glycerol. If it is necessary to store for a 
period longer than 1 year, the temperature must be kept below
-55 °C. To keep the plasmid under selection pressure, trans-
formed yeast strains should be kept in the proper selective 
medium. Remove a tiny frozen aliquot from the stock and 
streak on a suitable SD plate for 2–3 days at 30 °C to recover 
strains. 
10. Instead of performing two separate transformations, it is possi-
ble to carry out a single transformation of the yeast AH109 
with the two plasmids (pDEST32 and pDEST22 simulta-
neously or co-transformation). In this case, the selective 
growth medium after the transformation will be SD-Leu-Trp. 
Still, the transformation methodology will be the same as in 
steps 2–12, Subheading 3.1, except that 500 ng of each vector 
will be employed in co-transformation. However, the efﬁciency 
of this type of transformation is around 40% compared to the 
sequential transformation of each plasmid individually due to 
the lower probability that a given yeast cell will take up both 
plasmids. Nevertheless, this can be a viable alternative when 
one of the proteins is toxic to the yeast and ends up interfering 
with growth, thereby making sequential transformation more 
difﬁcult. 
11. Test the interaction in media containing different concentra-
tions of 3-AT that can vary from 1 mM to 50 mM depending 
on the strength of the interaction between the proteins eval-
uated. Higher concentrations of 3-AT are not advised as they 
will stop all growth. 3-AT is a competitive inhibitor of the 
enzyme 
HIS3 
(imidazoleglycerol-phosphate 
dehydratase), 
which acts by reducing background growth, allowing a more 
straightforward distinction between background and positive 
colonies. The optimal concentration of this reagent should be 
empirically determined for each assay. Remember: 3-AT is 
thermolabile and will be destroyed if added to a medium hotter 
than 55 °C. 
12. To facilitate the pipetting process, the bottom of the plate 
where the drops will be made can be marked with a microtube 
pen with dots at ~1 to 1.5 cm between them. Start pipetting on 
the plates from right to left, from the lowest to the highest

Two-Hybrid Assay in Yeast
207
culture concentration (this way, it is possible to use the same tip 
for the same combination). Make the drops with the aid of a 
micropipette and a maximum of 10 μL of each cell suspension. 
Be very careful when pipetting not to contaminate the plates or 
make sudden movements so that the drops are not scattered in 
the medium. 
13. Different concentrations of 3-AT are used in the two-hybrid 
test, but only the lowest concentration that inhibits back-
ground growth is shown in the ﬁgure with the ﬁnal results. 
Photograph the plates after the lowest dilution of the positive 
control to indicate growth. If you wait too long, the difference 
in growth between the dilutions will become insigniﬁcant. The 
ﬁnal ﬁgure should also include a plate with the drops made in 
SD-Leu-Trp medium. This part of the assay will act as a positive 
control for the presence of both plasmids in the cells. 
14. Autoactivation: Growth of negative controls when the protein 
fused to the BD domain is transformed together with the 
empty AD plasmid. This ﬁnding can be explained if the tested 
protein has a transcriptional activation domain, which is espe-
cially likely if it is a transcription factor [5, 25, 26]. In such 
cases, the two-hybrid assay can only be performed with that 
protein fused to the AD domain or with truncated versions of 
the protein in which the intrinsic AD domain is inactivated. It is 
also possible to test cloning in a different vector. For example, 
suppose autoactivation occurs in a vector with the tag at the 
N-terminus. In that case, the protein under analysis may show 
no self-activation at all when expressed as carboxy-terminal 
fusions. 
15. It is worth mentioning that some types of interactions are not 
detectable by the double-hybrid system. If one of the following 
occurs, it can interfere with the proteins’ ability to interact: 
(i) Fusion proteins are not stably expressed in the host cell 
because protein fusions that are either toxic or unstable in 
yeast; (ii) fusion to GAL4 domains obstructs the site of inter-
action; (iii) the fusion protein is incorrectly folded; (iv) the 
fusion protein cannot be localized to the yeast nucleus; or 
(v) posttranslational event-dependent interactions do not 
occur in yeast. For problem 1, checking fusion protein expres-
sion levels by western blot is essential. For 2, other combina-
tions of carboxy-terminal and amino-terminal fusion vectors 
can be tested and, for 3, alternatively, can be used partitioned 
domains of the protein, which do not contain a membrane 
localization signal. 
16. In addition to failure to detect interactions, the two-hybrid 
technique can produce false positives. False positives can 
occur, for example, when the interactions are detected in

208

yeast but have no biological relevance. A typical example is as 
follows: In vivo proteins are not located in the same cell com-
partment or are expressed in different tissues and stages of 
development [27]. Additionally, false positives may also result 
from the self-activation of the reporter gene (See Note 14). It is 
essential to validate the interactions detected by Y2H with 
alternative techniques such as co-immunoprecipitation, pull-
down, and bimolecular ﬂuorescence complementation (BiFC). 
17. The veriﬁcation of the fusion protein expression by Western 
blotting is strongly recommended, especially when no interac-
tion between the proteins is detected. For this, total yeast 
protein extracts are prepared from yeast liquid culture. Glass 
beads are not required for the methodology provided here. 
Use antibodies against the BD and AD domains (these are 
commercially available from several companies: Takara, Santa 
Cruz Biotechnology, and Invitrogen, for example). Electro-
phoretic separation, transfer, and membrane blocking can be 
performed according to standard laboratory protocols.

Bimolecular Fluorescence Complementation (BiFC) in Host– 
Virus Interactions 
Fredy Davi Albuquerque Silva, Joa˜o Paulo Batista Machado, 
and Pedro Augusto Braga dos Reis 
Abstract 
Bimolecular ﬂuorescence complementation (BiFC) is an assay widely used for studying protein–protein 
interactions and determining the subcellular localization of proteins. This technique involves fusing the 
proteins of interest to separate structural domains of a ﬂuorescent protein, followed by transient expression 
in cells. The interaction between the proteins of interest in vivo allows the reconstitution of the ﬂuorescence 
that can be visualized by ﬂuorescence microscopy. BiFC has been particularly useful in investigating the 
interactions between viral and host proteins. Here, we describe the steps involved in preparing expression 
cassettes that allow the expression of proteins of interest fused to nonﬂuorescent fragments of yellow 
ﬂuorescent protein (YFP), Agrobacterium transformations, and agroinﬁltration of Nicotiana benthamiana 
leaves to facilitate virus protein–host protein interactions. Finally, high-resolution images can be obtained 
by analyzing the leaves under a confocal microscope.

Introduction 
Protein–protein interaction assays are essential for uncovering the 
dynamics of protein function and network in the cellular machinery. 
Hence, they are extensively used to identify and characterize pro-
teins 
in 
their 
biological 
context 
in 
high-throughput 
or 
low-throughput assays. Yeast two-hybrid (Y2H), co-immunopreci-
pitation (CoIP), and bimolecular ﬂuorescence complementation 
(BiFC) are among the most used in the molecular biology ﬁeld. 
BiFC involves the expression of the proteins of interest fused to 
separate structural domains without the ﬂuorescence activity of a 
ﬂuorescent protein, such as a yellow ﬂuorescent protein (YFP) 
(Fig. 1), in living cells. Once the interaction occurs between the

two target proteins, the two molecular fragments of the ﬂuorescent 
protein (carboxy- and amino-terminal) independently fused to the 
interest proteins can reconstitute the ﬂuorescence signal. BiFC has 
been used in a variety of biological systems, which have allowed the 
identiﬁcation of several protein–protein interactions [1]. Moreover, 
it has been used to investigate direct viral protein–host protein 
interactions and their subcellular localization [2].

Fig. 1 Schematic representation of the BiFC assay. Two nonﬂuorescent fragments (N and C) of the yellow 
ﬂuorescent protein (YFP) are fused to putative interaction partners (A and B). The association of the interaction 
partners allows the formation of a bimolecular ﬂuorescent complex 
Viruses are obligate intracellular parasites that rely entirely on 
the host cells’ machinery to synthesize viral components such as 
nucleic acids, membranes, and proteins [3]. A movement protein 
(MP) is a speciﬁc virus-encoded protein that can recruit plant host 
factors to assist local and systemic viral spread throughout plant 
cells [4]. Therefore, identifying virus–host protein interaction 
allows a better understanding of virus infection in the plant. The 
BiFC approach has been utilized to study several protein–protein 
interactions in plants, such as interactions between: (1) intracellular 
MP, viral nuclear shuttle protein (NSP) from cabbage leaf curl virus 
(CabLCV), and NSP-interacting kinase 1 of Arabidopsis thaliana 
[5]; (2) the A. thaliana NSP-interacting syntaxin domain-
containing protein (NISP) and NSP from CabLCV in vesicle-like 
compartments [6]; (3) plant partners related to viral interactions 
such as A. thaliana WWP1 protein and NSP-interacting GTPase 
(NIG) [7]; and (4) signaling processes like co-receptor interaction 
complex NIK1 and ﬂagellin sensing 2/brassinosteroid insensitive 
1-associated kinase 1 (FLS2/BAK1) [8]. The BiFC method allows 
visualization of viral protein–host protein interactions and its sub-
cellular localization analysis without the proteins changing their 
chemical traits [9]. Here, we describe the BiFC approach for asses-
sing viral protein–host protein interactions and visualization and 
how to perform this method while avoiding false positives during 
the analysis. Moreover, we described the BiFC assay performed to

evaluate 
the 
interaction 
between 
two 
Arabidopsis 
proteins 
AtWWP1 and NIG, which are involved in virus infection responses. 
AtWWP1 relocates NIG from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, where 
it is conﬁned to AtWWP1-formed nuclear bodies, suggesting that 
the NIG-AtWWP1 interaction may interfere with the NIG proviral 
function associated with its cytosolic localization [7].

Cloning into BiFC 
Vectors 
1. The coding region of interest genes properly isolated and 
inserted into donor plasmids. The coding region of the NIG 
and AtWWP1 genes used in the BiFC assay shown in Fig. 2 was 
isolated by PCR (polymerase chain reaction) using gene-
speciﬁc 
primers 
and 
subsequently 
inserted 
into 
the 
pDONR™207 Gateway® entry vector (Thermo Scientiﬁc) 
via a BP recombination reaction, resulting in NIG-NS-
pDONR207 and AtWWP1-NS-pDONR207 clones. 
2. Plant BiFC vectors: sets of plant-compatible BiFC vectors, 
which allow the evaluation of protein–protein interactions 
using either the N- or C-terminal fusion of nonﬂuorescent 
fragments of YFP (see Note 1). In the BiFC assay illustrated 
in Fig. 2, we used the vectors SPYNE and SPYCE [10], which

Fig. 2 Confocal microscopy image of a BiFC experiment. The confocal microscopy images of the interaction 
between NIG and AtWWP1 proteins from Arabidopsis were obtained after 3 days of agroinﬁltration. The ﬁgure 
shows the different combinations of NIG and AtWWP1 proteins fused to C-terminal (cYFP) or N-terminal (nYFP) 
portions of YFP. Through the image resolution is possible to visualize the formation of nuclear speckles in the 
interaction of either NIG-nYFP + AtWPP1-cYFP or AtWPP1-nYFP + NIG-cYFP. The combination of NIG-nYFP, 
NIG-cYFP, AtWWP1-nYFP, and AtWWP1-cYFP with the empty vectors nYFP and cYFP showed no ﬂuorescence 
signal. Scale bars, 20 μm 
contain the N-terminus (nYFP) and C-terminal (cYFP) region 
of YFP, respectively, fused in frame at the C-terminal position 
of the proteins of interest. Thus, the genes of interest should be 
cloned into SPYNE and SPYCE without the stop codon.

Methods 
3.1 
Cloning into BiFC 
Vectors 
Depending on the cloning strategy to be used, the coding region of 
the genes of interest can be transferred to the BiFC vectors through 
cleavage and ligation or performing an LR recombination reaction 
between an attL-containing entry clone and an attR-containing 
destination vector to generate an expression clone (Gateway). The 
SPYNE and SPYCE vectors used in the BiFC assay, shown in Fig. 2, 
contain cloning sites compatible with the Gateway system. There-
fore, we performed an LR recombination reaction to transfer the 
coding region of NIG and AtWWP1 without the stop codon from 
entry 
clones 
(NIG-NS-pDONR207 
and 
AtWWP1-NS-
pDONR207) to the vectors SPYNE and SPYCE, resulting in 
NIG-nYFP, 
AtWWP1-nYFP, 
NIG-cYFP, 
and 
AtWWP1-cYFP 
expressing clones. 
1. Transform Escherichia coli (e.g., DH5α strain) with recombi-
nant expression plasmids following your preferred protocol. 
2. Spread E. coli cells on LB agar plates supplemented with appro-
priate antibiotics and incubate them at 37 °C overnight. The 
SPYNE and SPYCE vectors contain the kanamycin resistance 
gene. Therefore, NIG-nYFP, AtWWP1-nYFP, NIG-cYFP, and 
AtWWP1-cYFP 
expression 
vectors 
were 
selected 
in 
LB 
medium containing kanamycin 100 mg/L. 
3. Conﬁrm the colonies obtained by PCR using speciﬁc primers. 
4. Grow the individual colonies in 5 mL of LB liquid medium 
supplemented with the appropriate antibiotics at 37 °C under 
rotation of 200 rpm on a horizontal shaker. 
5. Extract the plasmid DNA using a miniprep kit following the 
manufacturers’ information. 
6. Sequence the recombinant plasmids to conﬁrm their correct 
sequence.

Transformation 
of Agrobacterium Cells 
by Electroporation 
1. Inoculate a single colony of Agrobacterium tumefaciens 
GV3101 from a fresh agar plate into a ﬂask containing 50 mL

and transfer to a - 80 °C freezer until required. 
3.2.2 
Electroporation
1. Remove an appropriate number of aliquots of Agrobacterium 
cells from the -80 °C freezer. Thaw the frozen cells on ice and 
add 0.5–1 μL (1–10 ng/μL) of plasmid DNA to 40 μL o  
recipient cells (see Note 8). 
2. Pipette the DNA/cell mixture into a cold electroporation 
cuvette (see Note 9). 
3. Carry out the electroporation by applying a single pulse of 
25 μF capacitance, 2.4 kV, and 200 Ω resistance (e.g., 
Bio-Rad Gene Pulser) (see Note 10). 
4. After applying the pulse, remove the electroporation cuvette 
and add 1 mL of LB medium at room temperature. 
5. Transfer the cells to a 1,5-mL microtube and incubate the 
cultures with gentle rotation for 2 h at 28 °C. 
6. Recover the cells by short centrifugation, resuspend them in 
0.1 mL LB medium, and spread on LB agar medium contain-
ing the appropriate antibiotic. A. tumefaciens GV3101 carry-
ing 
the 
NIG-nYFP, 
AtWWP1-nYFP, 
NIG-cYFP, 
and 
AtWWP1-cYFP 
expression 
vectors 
were 
selected 
in 
LB 
medium containing gentamycin 50 mg/L and kanamycin 
100 mg/L. 
7. Invert the plates and incubate them at 28 °C. Let colonies grow 
for 2–3 days. 
3.3 
Agroinﬁltration 
of Nicotiana 
benthamiana or 
Nicotiana tabacum 
1. Grow the previously transformed Agrobacterium cultures for 
16 h at 28 °C under 200 rpm shaking in 5 mL of LB medium 
plus appropriate antibiotics (see Note 11). 
2. Prepare the inﬁltration buffer (10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM MES, 
pH 5.6 adjusted with KOH) by mixture 1% (v/v) magnesium 
chloride (100×) and 1% (v/v) MES (100×) in deionized water 
(see Note 12). 
3. Centrifuge the Agrobacterium cultures containing the vectors 
of interest at 3000 × g for 5 min at room temperature and 
discard the supernatant. 
4. Resuspend the cell pellet in 3 mL inﬁltration buffer (see 
Note 13).

6. Add 200 μM acetosyringone and keep the cultures at room 
temperature for a minimum of 2 h and a maximum of 4 h in the 
dark (see Note 15). 
7. Measure the OD600 of each agrobacterial culture transformed 
with interested constructs using 100 μL of the cell suspension 
diluted in 900 μL of water. 
8. Dilute each agrobacterial suspension to OD600 of 1.0 in inﬁl-
tration buffer supplemented with 200 μM acetosyringone. 
9. Prepare working suspension by mixing different combinations 
of the A. tumefaciens carrying the appropriated BiFC con-
structs (Fig. 3) and the A. tumefaciens encoding a viral protein 
suppressor of RNA silencing (e.g., HC-Pro and P19) at a 1:1:1 
ratio. Prepare also negative controls by combining each protein 
partner fused to nYFP or cYFP with the cognate empty vector. 
10. Inﬁltrate agrobacterial suspensions on the abaxial side of the 
leaves of N. benthamiana or N. tabacum using a sterile 1 mL 
insulin syringe without the needle using gentle pressure 
(Fig. 4b) (see Notes 16 and 17). 
11. Keep the plants incubated in a growth chamber under long-day 
conditions (16 h light/8 h dark) (see Note 18).

Fluorescence 
Detection by a 
Confocal Microscope 
and Image Acquisition 
Observe the ﬂuorescence in the epidermal cell layer of the abaxial 
side expressing the fusion proteins 2–3 days post-inﬁltration (see 
Note 19) under confocal microscopy (Fig. 2) (see Note 20). YFP is 
a ﬂuorescent protein with an optimal excitation wavelength in the 
range of 490–515 nm (excitation peak at 513 nm) and maximal 
emission intensity in the range of 520–560 nm (emission peak at 
530 nm). Therefore, the YFP ﬂuorescence might be visualized 
using an appropriate laser and ﬁlter set. In this protocol, the images 
shown in Fig. 2 were obtained using a Zeiss inverted LSM 
510 META laser scanning microscope equipped with an argon 
laser as an excitation source and a 40× or 63× oil immersion lens. 
The ﬂuorescence detection and image acquisition procedures are 
described below: 
1. With a scalpel, make a 0.5–1.0 cm2 cut in the inﬁltrated 
area leaf. 
2. Transfer the specimen to a glass slide, add a drop of distilled 
water (mounting medium) onto it (see Note 21) and cover it 
with the coverslip (see Note 22). 
3. Turn on only the laser(s) needed to excite the ﬂuorophores in 
your sample. In the case of YFP, we use an argon laser (see Note 
23). Set the output intensity to an appropriate level (40% is a 
good starting point). 
4. Select single-track mode and choose a ﬁlter conﬁguration for 
the particular ﬂuorophores you are using. To obtain the images 
shown in Fig. 2, YFP was excited with a 514 nm wavelength of 
an argon laser (utilizable laser intensity to 20%). The emission 
was collected using a 521–553 nm ﬁlter.

5. Select the appropriate scan average from the available values 
2, 4, 8, and 16 to obtain the ﬁnal image (see Note 24). The 
images in Fig. 2 were obtained from 8 scans in average 
line mode. 
6. Set the pinhole diameter (see Note 25). 
7. Start scanning the sample. The preliminary image, whether too 
dim or too bright, usually needs to be optimized. 
8. To optimize the image, go to the image window, and then 
select ‘Palette’ from the toolbar. Choose “ranger indicator” 
from the color palette list. The range indicator palette is used 
to optimize the gain and offset setting of images before scan-
ning. Restart scanning the sample and set the Detector Gain up 
to no more than a small percentage of your stained areas have 
red pixels. Adjust the Ampliﬁer Offset until the background is a 
mixture of blue and black pixels. 
9. If necessary, the zoom and scan ﬁeld rotation can be set. The 
images in Fig. 2 were captured with an objective of 40×. Those 
images showing protein–protein interaction were obtained 
with a scan zoom of 2.5. 
10. Acquire and save the image. 
11. Perform image processing using Zeiss LSM 510 software and 
Adobe Photoshop.

Notes 
1. Different sets of vectors are available for N-terminal or 
C-terminal YFP fusions. They contain the N-terminal and 
C-terminal portion of YFP fused in frame at the N- or 
C-terminal position of the proteins under study. Because fusion 
can interfere with the interaction domains of proteins of inter-
est, deciding whether the N-terminal or C-terminal YFP fusion 
is more suitable for the study is essential. 
2. Antibiotics dissolved in ethanol do not need to be sterilized. 
Store solutions in containers protected from light. 
3. Sterilize the solution by ﬁltration through a disposable ﬁlter 
(0.22 μm pore size). Divide into 10 mL aliquots and store at 4 ° 
C. 
4. Acetosyringone 
is 
diluted 
in 
99,5% 
dimethyl 
sulfoxide 
(DMSO), ethanol, or dimethyl formamide (DMF). 
5. Prepare acetosyringone stocks in small batches, store them at -
20 °C, and discard them after a month. 
6. Carefully decant the supernatant and use an automatic pipette 
to remove any remaining drops of water.

BiFC in Plant-Virus Interactions
221
7. This is best done by gentle swirling rather than pipetting or 
vortexing. 
8. Ideally, the DNA to be electroporated should be resuspended 
in water or TE buffer (Tris–HCl pH 8.0, 10 mM EDTA 
pH 8.0) at a concentration of 1–10 ng/μL. The presence of 
ions in the electroporation cuvette increases the conductivity of 
the solution and causes the electrical current to arc or skip 
through the solution of cells and DNA. If arcing occurs in 
the presence of DNA but not in its absence, remove ions 
from the DNA preparation through dilution or puriﬁcation 
by spin-column chromatography. 
9. Tap the solution to ensure that the suspension of bacteria and 
DNA sits at the bottom of the cuvette. 
10. Before placing the cuvette in the electroporation device, dry 
the condensation and moisture from outside the cuvette. 
11. Always use fresh Agrobacterium cultures for all inﬁltrations. 
12. To 100 mL of buffer, add 1 mL of 1 M magnesium chloride 
(100×) and 1 mL of 1 M MES (100×) in 98 mL of deionized 
water. 
13. Inﬁltration buffer must be prepared fresh on the day of assay. 
14. The cells can be resuspended in a smaller volume if they do not 
recover large quantities of cells. 
15. It is recommended to keep the cells in the agroinﬁltration 
buffer for 2–4 h to activate virulence gene expression. 
16. Select individual leaves of N. benthamiana or N. tabacum with 
4- to 6-week-old. Do not pick too old or very young leaves to 
inﬁltrate (Fig. 4a). Be careful not to damage the leaf. Dry any 
amount of suspension leaked during inﬁltration and mark the 
inﬁltrated area with a pen because the inﬁltrated area will not be 
distinguishable from the non-inﬁltrated area. 
17. Perform a mock inﬁltration with inﬁltration buffer to assess 
background ﬂuorescence or protein level. 
18. It is recommended to keep the plants in a high-light environ-
ment after inﬁltration. This will optimize the expression of the 
constructs. 
19. The transient expression tends to peak around 60–72 h post-
inﬁltration and rapidly declines after that. 
20. To complement the interpretation of the images obtained, it is 
suggested to analyze the expression level of the fusion proteins 
in the inﬁltrated leaf area employing western blotting to make 
sure that all the proteins were expressed in the experiment, 
even the control conditions.

21. If a large amount of water has been added and the coverslip has 
ﬂoated, or if the water has bled out to the edges of the slide, 
you can use the edge of the paper towel and place it next to the 
edge of the coverslip and just let the paper towel extract some 
of the excess water. 
22. Avoid the formation of air bubbles because they will make the 
visualization of the specimen more difﬁcult. Air bubbles have a 
different refractive index than water, making the bubble appear 
darker and thicker under the microscope lens. To minimize the 
formation of air bubbles, try placing the coverslip on edge and 
slowly lowering it onto the slide. Another alternative is to place 
the specimen in a vacuum chamber and pump it. However, the 
presence of air bubbles does not mean that you cannot fully 
observe the sample. If air bubbles do not obstruct or impair the 
observation of the sample, just work around the existing air 
bubbles. 
23. To turn on the argon laser, click standby to warm it up. After 
the initial warm-up period, the on button will appear, allowing 
the laser to be fully activated. 
24. Higher the number of scan averages selected in the mean 
average method, the better will be the image quality; however, 
the scanning time will be longer. When using the mean 
method, the image information is generated by adding up all 
scans, pixel by pixel, and then calculating the mean value. The 
averaging scan number necessary to obtain a good image 
depends on the signal-to-noise ratio of your sample image. 
Low-contrast images require a higher averaging scan number, 
but be aware that this could cause photobleaching. Most sam-
ples will require an average scan number of 4 or 8. 
25. The smaller the pinhole, the thinner the optical slice will be, 
and the less light will be collected. A pinhole set to 1 Airy unit 
will provide optimal resolution. However, the pinhole must be 
adjusted according to the sample’s ﬂuorescence, using higher 
Airy values for darker samples.

Co-immunoprecipitation Assays to Detect Protein–Protein 
Interactions 
Mengling Huang, Xiao Yu, and Bo Li 
Abstract 
Proteins usually do not function as monomers but rather perform their functions by interacting with 
themselves or other proteins. Co-immunoprecipitation is an essential assay for detecting protein interac-
tions in vivo. In this chapter, we describe how to use co-immunoprecipitation to detect protein interactions 
in 
Arabidopsis 
protoplasts, 
seedlings, 
and 
Nicotiana 
benthamiana 
leaves. 
When 
using 
co-immunoprecipitation assays to detect protein interactions, it is necessary to pay attention to the design 
of the experimental and control groups. 
Key words Protein–protein interaction in vivo, Co-immunoprecipitation, Arabidopsis protoplasts,

Introduction 
Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) is a classical method to study 
protein–protein interaction based on the speciﬁcity of the interac-
tion between antibodies and antigens [1]. It is an effective method 
for determining the interactions of multiple proteins in vivo. Here, 
we will mainly describe the speciﬁc experimental steps of Co-IP and 
considerations. In brief, Co-IP consists of the following steps, 
including sample preparation, sample lysis, target protein capture, 
protein complex puriﬁcation, and result analysis by Western blot 
(Fig. 1). To explore protein interactions in plant cells, samples 
could be obtained from various materials, including Arabidopsis 
protoplasts 
[2], 
Arabidopsis 
seedlings 
[3], 
and 
Nicotiana 
benthamiana leaves [4]. 
Co-IP has been successfully and widely applied to detect pro-
tein interactions in various aspects of plant research. The speciﬁc 
interaction between the secreted peptides SMALL PHYTOCYTO-

PLANT SCREW UNRESPONSIVE RECEPTOR (NUT) was 
demonstrated by Co-IP [5]. The dynamic interaction among the 
components in the receptor complex was shown, such as the 
leucine-rich repeat receptor kinases ﬂagellin-sensitive 2 (FLS2)/ 
BRI1-associated receptor kinase 1 (BAK1)/Botrytis-induced kinase 
1 (BIK1) interaction in a stimulus-dependent manner [6, 7]. The 
Ralstonia solanacearum type III effector (T3E) PopP2 and Pseudo-
monas syringae pv. tomato T3E AvrRps4 interact with the 
nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NB-LRR) receptor resis-
tance (R) protein RRS1 (resistance to Ralstonia solanacearum 1) 
[8]. A recent study has shown that the R. solanacearum type III 
effector RipAB disrupts salicylate signaling by targeting Arabidop-

PROTEIN 
(TGA) transcription factors, and the interaction between RipAB 
and TGA transcription factors was demonstrated by Co-IP 
[2]. Co-IP has also been used to demonstrate interactions between 
other virulence factors and targets; for example, the C4 protein 
from the geminivirus tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV)

interacts with calcium-sensing receptor (CAS) in chloroplasts to 
suppress downstream defense responses [9]. Several independently 
evolved virulence factors from unrelated plant RNA viruses hijack 
and repress the jasmonic acid (JA) pathway by disturbing the medi-
ator subunit (OsMED25) and basic helix–loop–helix (bHLH) 
transcription factors (OsMYC3) complex and cooperating with 
Jasmonate ZIM domain (JAZ) to synergistically attenuate JA sig-
naling. Co-IP was used to analyze the interaction between viral 
proteins and host proteins [10]. Therefore, Co-IP is a commonly 
used and effective assay for detecting protein interactions.

Methods 
3.1 
Preparing 
Sample 
Co-IP assays are generally performed using plant materials from the 
following sources. 
1. Arabidopsis protoplasts 
Isolate Arabidopsis protoplasts (see Plant Signal Transduction: 
Methods and Protocols, Methods in Molecular Biology Chapter 8 
for isolation protocol) [13]; transfect 500 μL protoplasts with 
25 μL bait gene vector (1.6 μg/μL) and 25 μL prey gene vector

(1.6 μg/μL) or control vector (1.6 μg/μL); incubate the trans-
fected protoplasts in the 6-well culture plates under low light for 
8–12 h, you can set different treatments if you need; harvest the 
protoplasts in a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube and freeze them in -80 °C. 
Co-IP for Protein-Protein Complex Detection
229
Fig. 2 Co-IP assays to examine the interactions between RipAB and TGA4 in vivo. 
RipAB-GFP was co-expressed with TGA4-HA in Arabidopsis protoplasts. Total 
protein extracts were immunoprecipitated with GFP-trap beads and immuno-
blotted using an anti-HA or anti-GFP antibody 
For example, to detect the interaction between RipAB and 
TGA4, a vector can be constructed with the TGA4 gene fused 
with an HA tag as the prey and the RipAB gene with an GFP tag 
as the bait, the experimental setup is as follows: negative control 
group: ASR3-HA (unrelated protein-HA) + empty vector-GFP, 
ASR3-HA + RipAB-GFP or TGA4-HA + empty vector-GFP; 
experimental group: TGA4-HA + RipAB-GFP (Fig. 2). 
2. Arabidopsis seedlings 
Seedlings are grown on ½ MS plates for 10 ~ 12 days and 
transferred to ddH2O for overnight recovery (perform the proper 
treatment if you need); collect ﬁve seedlings in a 1.5-mL centrifuge 
tube, and twenty seedlings are harvested per sample. 
Considering that the antibodies for endogenous proteins 
sometimes do not work efﬁciently, complementary transgenic 
plants carrying target proteins fused with proper tags can be con-
structed. 
For 
example, 
to 
verify 
the 
interaction 
between 
ENHANCED DISEASE SUSCEPTIBILITY (EDS1) and PBS1-
LIKE 19 (PBL19) in planta, transgenic plants expressing pEDS1: 
EDS1-FLAG/pPBL19:PBL19C3A-GFP-HA in the eds1 pbl19 back-
ground was generated, and pPBL19:PBL19C3A-GFP-HA/pbl19 
transgenic plants were used as a control [11]. Here, EDS1-FLAG 
was the prey protein, and PBL19-GFP-HA was the bait protein.

3. N. benthamiana leaves 
Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101 contains the binary 
vector for the bait gene and prey gene, respectively; before inﬁltra-
tion, the bacterial suspension is adjusted to OD600 of 1.5; mix the 
bacterial cultures containing the bait gene vector and the prey gene 
vector at a 1:1 ratio and inﬁltrate into the leaves of three-week-old 
soil-grown N. benthamiana; after inﬁltration for 1 ~ 3 days, collect 
ﬁve leaf disks (5 mm in diameter) in a 1.5-mL centrifuge tube and 
around 25 leaf disks are harvested per sample. 
The 
experimental 
setup 
refers 
to 
that 
in 
Arabidopsis 
protoplasts. 
3.2 
Cell Lysate and 
Input Sample 
Preparation 
1. Add 200 μL Co-IP buffer in the samples and vortex to resus-
pend the protoplasts. 
2. Take 20 μL supernatant into a new 1.5-mL centrifuge tube 
with 20 μL 2  × SDS protein loading buffer. Heat the samples in 
a metal bath at 95 °C for 5 min. These samples will be used for 
the input (see Note 2). 
3.2.1 
Samples from 
Arabidopsis Protoplasts 
3. Add another 300 μL Co-IP buffer into the tubes prepared from 
step “1.” Vortex vigorously and incubate on ice for 10 ~ 15 min 
(see Note 3). You can precool the centrifuge to 4 °C i  
this step. 
4. Centrifuge at 4 °C at 12,000 rpm for 10 ~ 15 min (the pellet 
should be white), and collect the supernatant into a new 
centrifuge tube. 
3.2.2 
Samples from 
Arabidopsis Seedlings and 
N. benthamiana Leaves 
1. Ground the seedlings or leaves with the motor driven homo-
genizing pestle in liquid nitrogen. Add 150 μL Co-IP buffer 
per centrifuge tube and keep on ice for 10 ~ 15 min (see 
Note 4). 
2. Centrifuge the samples at 4 °C at 12,000 rpm for 10 ~ 15 min. 
3. Combine the supernatant from the same sample into one tube 
and centrifuge again to remove the residue. Transfer the super-
natant to a new tube. 
4. Take 20 μL supernatant into a new 1.5-mL microfuge tube 
with 20 μL 2  × SDS protein loading buffer. Heat the samples in 
a metal bath at 95 °C for 5 min. These samples will be used for 
the input. 
3.3 
Incubation with 
Suitable Beads and 
Antibody Capture 
1. Preclean can remove the host proteins that bind nonspeciﬁcally 
to the protein A/G agarose from the lysate and help reduce the 
background signal. To preclean, add 5 μL protein A/G agarose 
into the supernatant from steps “4” in 3.2.1 or steps “3” in 
3.2.2, incubate at 4 °C with gentle shaking for 30 min, spin 
with the swing bucket centrifuge at 1000 rpm for 1 min, and 
take the supernatant to a new tube for subsequent steps.

Co-IP for Protein-Protein Complex Detection
231
If the Beads Are Coupled with Antibodies 
2. Wash the beads twice with Co-IP washing buffer. Use 
5 ~ 10  μL beads for each sample. Resuspend the beads after 
washing with 20 μL Co-IP buffer for each sample. Make sure 
beads are mixed evenly before being added to different tubes 
(see Note 5). 
3. Add the beads to the supernatant from step “1” in 3.3, making 
sure to allocate an equal volume of beads to each sample. 
4. Incubate at 4 °C with gentle shaking for 2 ~ 3 h (see Note 6). 
If the Beads Are Not Coupled with Antibodies 
5. Transfer the supernatant from step “1” in 3.3 into a new tube 
with proper antibody (usually 1 μL) and incubate at 4 °C with 
gentle shaking for 1 ~ 2 h. 
6. Wash protein A/G agarose beads twice with Co-IP buffer, and 
use 5 μL beads per sample. 
7. Add the beads into the tubes prepared from step “5” and 
incubate at 4 °C with gentle shaking for 1 ~ 2 h (see Note 6). 
3.4 
Washing
1. After step “4” or step “7” in 3.3, spin with the swing bucket 
centrifuge at 1000 rpm for 1 min (see Note 7). Discard super-
natant with vacuum (see Note 8). 
2. Wash the beads 3 ~ 5  times with Co-IP washing buffer (see 
Note 9). Try to eliminate the supernatant completely without 
touching the beads (see Note 10). 
3.5 
Elution
1. Add 30 μL 2  × SDS protein loading buffer, heat for 10 min at 
95 °C, and then spin for 2 min. These will be the Co-IP 
samples. 
3.6 
Sample Analysis 
by Western Blot 
1. Run input and Co-IP samples including all controls in 
SDS-PAGE gels for Western blot. 10 μL of input samples are 
used to detect the prey and bait proteins, respectively. A 5 μL 
Co-IP sample is used to detect the prey proteins, and a 15 μL 
Co-IP sample is used to detect the bait proteins. 
2. Use appropriate antibodies to detect the prey and bait proteins 
to determine whether they interact with each other or to 
evaluate the strength of their interaction. 
3. The band intensity can be calculated using Image J if you need 
to quantify the band intensities and compare the afﬁnity among 
different conditions.

Notes 
1. The comparison of the properties of agarose resin and magnetic 
beads: agarose resin—porous structure, strong binding ability, 
high background signal, and relatively inexpensive. 
Magnetic beads: solids, relatively weak binding ability, low 
background signal, and relatively expensive. 
2. The input sample preparation is important because these sam-
ples are used to prove the presence of the target proteins that 
you want to test for interaction. 
3. Ensure that the samples are sufﬁciently lysed so that the pro-
teins are completely released in the buffer. 
4. Arabidopsis seedlings and N. benthamiana leaves should be 
well grounded, and the supernatant should be free of plant 
tissues; if not, centrifuge again and carefully transfer the super-
natant to a new tube. 
5. Assign same amount of beads to each sample to ensure the 
homogeneity of the experiment. 
6. Incubating the beads and proteins for too long at 4 °C will not 
enhance the binding; instead, you will get a much higher 
background or nonspeciﬁc precipitation. 
7. If you use magnetic beads, you can use a magnetic stand to 
separate the beads from the liquid. 
8. With the help of a vacuum, the supernatant is sucked out 
quickly and thoroughly. 
9. The washing buffer should be kept on ice to ensure that the 
buffer is used in an ice-cold state. 
10. Try to remove the supernatant completely to avoid the non-
speciﬁc binding of proteins.

Split-Luciferase Complementation Imaging Assay in Virus– 
Plant Interactions 
Huang Tan, Xi Zhang, and Rosa Lozano-Duran 
Abstract 
Protein-protein interactions constitute the interface between a virus and the cell it infects and are crucial 
determinants of the outcome of the viral infection. Multiple techniques have been developed to study how 
viral and host proteins interact in plants; among them, the split-luciferase complementation imaging assay 
stands out due to its capacity to detect protein-protein interactions in vivo, in the context of the infection, 
if desired, in an easy, fast, quantitative, and inexpensive manner. In this chapter, we use the interaction 
between the V2 protein from the geminivirus tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) and Nicotiana 
benthamiana Argonaute 4 (AGO4) as an example to present how to perform this simple yet powerful 
assay using transient Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation of N. benthamiana leaves to test 
the protein-protein interactions of choice.

Introduction 
Viruses are intracellular parasites that require the host molecular 
machinery to accomplish their own vital functions. The interaction 
between virus-encoded and cellular proteins constitutes the inter-
face between the pathogen and host. Therefore, their detection and 
analysis are essential to fully understand how the infection takes 
place. 
In plants, multiple techniques have been used to test virus-
host protein-protein interactions; among them, the split-luciferase 
complementation assay [1] stands out since it offers several advan-
tages over other alternatives. To begin with, this approach can use 
transient Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation of 
Nicotiana benthamiana, a popular model species in plant virology, 
and is fast, simple, and inexpensive. In addition, it is quick, sensi-
tive, and quantitative and likely detects direct interactions. Finally,

this technique is applied in the cellular context, where the proteins 
of interest are in their natural subcellular localization, and the 
experiments can be performed both in infected and uninfected 
cells.

Huang Tan et al.
In this assay, the proteins of interest are fused to one half of the 
luciferase enzyme each (N- or C-terminal fragments, NLuc or 
CLuc) and co-expressed in plant cells—in the proposed protocol 
here, following the transient transformation of N. benthamiana 
leaves mediated by A. tumefaciens. The luciferase protein is only 
reconstituted when the two fusion proteins interact, driven by the 
proteins of interest, bringing the NLuc and CLuc fragments into 
close spatial proximity and hence restoring enzymatic activity. 
When the substrate luciferin is provided, this activity results in 
light emission, which is detectable by a luminometer or a charge-
coupled 
device 
(CCD) 
imaging 
system 
dynamically 
and 
quantitatively. 
In the ﬁrst description of the split-luciferase complementation 
imaging protocol, the translational fusion of the proteins of interest 
to NLuc or CLuc was accomplished through traditional molecular 
cloning following restriction and ligation [1]; in order to simplify 
the cloning step, Gateway-compatible versions of the vectors were 
later generated [2, 3]. This approach has been successfully used to 
identify interactions between plant and viral proteins or among viral 
proteins in plant cells [e.g., 4–6]. 
In this chapter, we use the interaction between the V2 protein 
from the geminivirus tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) and 
the Argonaute 4 (AGO4) protein from its experimental host 
N. benthamiana [4] as a case example of how to perform this 
simple yet powerful assay to uncover protein-protein interactions 
in plant virology.

Methods 
3.1 
Plant Cultivation
1. Sow N. benthamiana seeds in a 3:1 mixture of potting sub-
strate and vermiculite. Cover the pots with plastic ﬁlm, and 
then put them in a controlled growth room or growth chamber 
in long-day conditions (16 h light and 8 h dark). 
2. Check regularly and water the plants if needed to keep the soil 
humid. 
3. 10–14 days after sowing, transfer seedlings into individual 
plastic pots and cover them again with transparent plastic lids 
or plastic ﬁlm for 2–3 days to minimize stress caused by trans-
planting (see Note 8). 
4. Water plants regularly and add fertilizer if needed. Four-week-
old plants are used for the split-luciferase complementation 
assay (see Note 9). 
3.2 
Molecular 
Cloning 
In this protocol, the Gateway-compatible binary vectors (pGWB-
NLuc and pGWB-CLuc, [2, 3]) are used (see Notes 1 and 2). The 
Gateway cloning procedure is outlined below. 
1. PCR-amplify the coding sequence of genes of interest (GOI) 
using gene-speciﬁc primers (see Subheading 2.3). 
2. Run the PCR products in a 1% agarose gel by electrophoresis, 
cut the bands with the expected size, and purify them using a 
gel extraction kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 
3. Clone the puriﬁed gene fragments into a Gateway entry vector 
(e.g., pDONR™ 207, Thermo Scientiﬁc) via a BP reaction 
following the manufacturer’s instructions. 
4. Transform each BP reaction into E. coli (e.g., DH5α strain) 
competent cells by transformation following your preferred 
protocol. Plate them on selective LB plates supplemented 
with appropriate antibiotics and incubate them in a 37 °C 
oven overnight. 
5. Check individual colonies by PCR using speciﬁc primers. Grow 
a conﬁrmed colony in 5 mL LB liquid medium containing 
appropriate antibiotics and incubate the culture in a 37 °C 
shaker (200 rpm) overnight. 
6. Purify plasmid DNA using a miniprep kit following the manu-
facturer’s instructions or the classic homemade alkaline lysis 
protocol 
[8]. 
Conﬁrm 
the 
cloned 
sequence 
by 
DNA 
sequencing. 
7. Perform an LR reaction to subclone the GOI into the split-
luciferase Gateway-compatible binary vectors (Fig. 1a, b, see 
Note 2).

used in split-luciferase complementation assay. (a) Cassettes to express the 
fusion proteins of interest (POI) in Gateway-compatible vectors: pGWB-NLuc and 
pGWB-CLuc. NLuc: N-terminal part of luciferase; CLuc: C-terminal part of 
luciferase; 35S pro: 35S promoter, which is a constitutive promoter derived 
from cauliﬂower mosaic virus (CaMV); E9-Ter: E9-terminator, containing termi-
nator and polyadenylation signal from the pea rbcS-E9 gene; LB: left border; RB: 
right border. (b) Two fragments of luciferase (NLuc and CLuc) can be fused to 
either the N- or C-terminus of the POI. Therefore, eight pairwise combinations 
can be tested for each potential protein-protein interaction. (c) A negative 
control must be included in the assay. Four types of negative controls are 
listed here: replacing one POI (e.g., protein B) by (I) an empty vector expressing 
luciferase fragment only (CLuc); (II) a mutated version of the protein B (mB); (III) a 
protein that is known not to interact (protein C); and (IV) an unrelated protein with 
similar subcellular localization (protein D) 
8. Proceed as indicated in steps 4, 5, and 6. After this, constructs 
to express the fusion proteins for split-luciferase complementa-
tion imaging analysis are successfully generated. 
3.3 
Agrobacterium-
Mediated Transient 
Transformation 
1. Transform the plasmids generated in Subheading 3.2 into 
A. tumefaciens (e.g., GV3101 strain) competent cells by trans-
formation following your preferred protocol. Select the colo-
nies containing the corresponding binary vectors by colony 
PCR using speciﬁc primers. 
2. Grow a single positive colony in 5 mL LB liquid medium 
containing appropriate antibiotics and incubate the culture at 
a
 28
 °C 
shaker 
(200 
rpm) 
for 
16–24 
h 
until 
the 
OD600 = 0.5–1.5 (see Note 10). We recommend making a 
glycerol stock (in 25% glycerol) for each A. tumefaciens clone 
and storing it at -80 °C. Before using, streak out A. tumefa-
ciens clones harboring the desired binary vectors on LB solid 
plates supplemented with appropriate antibiotics and incubate 
them in a 28 °C oven for 2 days.

Fig. 2 Detection of a host-virus protein-protein interaction by split-luciferase imaging assay. A case study: 
the V2 protein encoded by tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) interacts with the Argonaute 4 (AGO4) protein 
from N. benthamiana. (a) The third or fourth youngest leaves from 4-week-old N. benthamiana plants, 
indicated by white arrows, are selected for Agrobacterium-mediated transient transformation. “1,” as a 
negative control, refers to the co-expression of V2-NLuc and SlWRKY75-CLuc. “2,” as an experimental 
sample, refers to the co-expression of V2-NLuc and NbAGO4-CLuc. Experimental samples and negative 
controls should be inﬁltrated in the same leaf. (b) Inﬁltrate luciferin into the Agrobacterium-inoculated zone at 
36–48 hours post-inﬁltration (hpi). Following a 5-min dark treatment, capture the luminescence signal in a 
CCD imaging apparatus (e.g., NightShade LB985). (c) Representative images of the luminescence signal. The 
color bar indicates the detected counts per second (cps) of luminescence emission in leaves. (d) Deﬁne the 
regions of interest (ROIs) and export the overall cps and the number of pixels from the NightShade LB985 
controlling software Indigo™. The average value (cps) of the relative luciferase activity = overall cps/number 
of pixels. (e) Representative graph showing the average values (cps) of relative luciferase activity of ROIs in 
1 and 2 (see (a)). Error bars represent the standard deviation from four biological replicates. Asterisks indicate 
a statistically signiﬁcant difference between the experiment sample and the negative control according to a 
two-tailed t-test. **: p < 0.01 
3. Harvest the A. tumefaciens cells by centrifugation at 4000 × g 
for 10 min and discard the supernatant completely. 
4. Resuspend the pellets in the inﬁltration buffer (see Subsection 
2.4) and measure the optical density (OD600) using a 
spectrophotometer. 
5. Adjust the ﬁnal concentration of bacteria to OD600 = 0.1–0.5 
(see Note 11). 
6. Incubate the inﬁltration solution in the dark and at room 
temperature for 2–4 h  (see Note 12). 
7. Before co-inﬁltration, mix equal volumes (1:1) of two 
A. tumefaciens clones carrying binary vectors to express the 
NLuc- and CLuc-fused protein, respectively. Both positive and 
negative controls are required (Fig. 1c, see Notes 13–15).

242
Huang Tan et al.
8. Inﬁltrate fully expanded leaves (usually the third or fourth 
youngest) from 4-week-old N. benthamiana plants with a 
1-mL needleless syringe (see Notes 16 and 17). Inﬁltration is 
performed by pressing the syringe on the abaxial side of the leaf 
and applying pressure with a ﬁngertip on the other side. Inﬁl-
trate the experimental groups and negative controls side by side 
in the same leaf to avoid leaf-to-leaf variation (Fig. 2a, see 
Note 18). 
9. Remove the excess inﬁltration solution from the leaf surface 
using tissue paper. Label the inﬁltration area using a permanent 
marker pen. 
10. Put the plants back into the growth room or growth chamber. 
The luciferase activity will be measured at 36–48 h post-
inoculation (hpi) (see Note 19). 
3.4 
Luminescence 
Detection by a CCD 
Imaging System and 
Data Analysis 
1. At 36–48 hpi, inﬁltrate 1 mM D-luciferin solution (diluted in 
H2O) into the marked inﬁltration zone. 
2. Cut off the inﬁltrated leaves and place them in the dark for 
5–10 min before imaging to remove the background caused by 
the chlorophyll luminescence. 
3. Put the leaves upside down inside the CCD imaging apparatus 
(e.g., NightShade LB985). Use the NightShade LB985 
controlling software Indigo™ to set the acquisition parameters 
(e.g., exposure time) and to capture the luminescence signal 
(Fig. 2b, c, See Note 20). 
4. Deﬁne the regions of interest (ROI) for all samples and con-
trols. Export the values of the relative luciferase activity (counts 
per second (cps)) and the size of ROIs (number of pixels). 
Calculate the average value (cps) of the relative luciferase activ-
ity (total luminescence value/the number of pixels) in the ROI 
(see Note 7). 
5. Use the average values (cps) from different leaves for data 
representation and statistical analyses (Fig. 2d, e).

Notes 
1. Alternatively, the original vectors pCAMBIA1300-NLuc/ 
CLuc [1] can be used to generate constructs that express the 
fusion proteins of interest (POIs) via traditional cloning. In 
addition, if Golden Gate or Green Gate cloning is preferred, 
the modules containing NLuc or CLuc can be generated. 
2. In pGWB-NLuc, the NLuc is fused to the C-terminal part of 
the POI, while in pGWB-CLuc, the CLuc is fused to the 
N-terminal of the POI. Fusion orientation might have a signif-
icant impact on the results of the split-luciferase assay. Ideally,

Split Luciferase Assay in Virus–Plant Interactions
243
without prior knowledge, we recommend that both constructs 
be generated for each POI so that all possible pairwise combi-
nations can be tested (Fig. 1b). 
3. The genes of interest should be cloned into pGWB-NLuc and 
pGWB-CLuc with and without stop codon, respectively. 
4. Autoclaving is not recommended for MES buffer. 
5. Acetosyringone is a natural phenolic product and induces the 
expression of virulence genes of Agrobacterium, which are 
required for T-DNA transfer. It is known to improve transfor-
mation efﬁciency in both dicot and monocot plants. 
6. The sodium or potassium salt of D-Luciferin is more conve-
nient for experiments than the free acid form since it readily 
dissolves in water. The D-Luciferin solution should be pro-
tected from light. To avoid repeated freezing and thawing, we 
recommend aliquoting the D-Luciferin solution in small 
volumes. In our hands, 10 mM D-Luciferin stocks are still 
suitable for use after 6 months of storage at -20 °C. 
7. The luciferase activity can also be quantitatively analyzed using 
a luminometer. 
8. We use 7 × 5 cm round pots, placing 1 N. benthamiana plant 
per pot. 
9. To ensure reliable and reproducible results, only healthy 
N. benthamiana plants, which are critical for the efﬁcient tran-
sient expression of the POIs, should be used. Five-week-old 
plants can also be used for transient expression assays. Using 
plants older than 5-week-old should be avoided. 
10. Typically, 5 mL of overnight cultured A. tumefaciens cells 
should be enough to inﬁltrate at least three fully expanded 
leaves. Freshly prepared Agrobacterium culture/plates should 
be used each time. 
11. We use a ﬁnal OD600 = 0.5 in most cases. However, we 
recommend optimizing the ﬁnal OD600 experimentally to 
ensure that accumulation of the POI is appropriate, but there 
is no tissue damage caused by high bacterial load. 
12. Prior to inﬁltration, incubation of the Agrobacterium suspen-
sions in the dark is needed to fully induce the Agrobacterium 
vir genes by acetosyringone, which is essential for efﬁcient 
transformation. 
13. To indicate that the assay works, inﬁltrating a positive control is 
essential. We usually inﬁltrate the negative controls and the 
samples to be tested in one leaf and the positive control in 
another leaf.

244
Huang Tan et al.
14. To exclude non-speciﬁc and artifactual signals, appropriate 
negative controls should be incorporated into the split-
luciferase assay. In many examples available in the literature, 
empty vectors (either expressing NLuc or CLuc only) serve as 
negative interaction control. However, for examining the inter-
action between protein A and B, the ideal negative control 
would entail replacing protein B with a mutated version 
known not to interact with protein A or an unrelated protein 
with the same subcellular localization as protein A. 
15. The interaction between plant and viral proteins can also be 
examined in the context of the viral infection. To this end, an 
infectious viral clone of interest should be co-inﬁltrated with 
clones harboring binary vectors expressing both NLuc- and 
CLuc-fused proteins. 
16. Choose healthy leaves of similar size for inﬁltration. If the 
leaves are difﬁcult to inﬁltrate, pricking gently on the abaxial 
side of the leaf with a needle will help. 
17. To avoid cross-contamination, wipe the wet surface of the 
inﬁltration zone with tissue paper and clean your gloves by 
using 75% ethanol before moving to the next inoculum. 
18. We inﬁltrate at least four independent leaves from different 
plants for each biological replicate. 
19. The POI accumulation normally reaches a high level at 
36–48 h post-inﬁltration (hpi). However, it is advisable to 
optimize the time for your POI experimentally. 
20. We strongly recommend collecting the leaf samples from the 
inﬁltrated area for protein extraction and checking the accu-
mulation of all tested proteins and controls by western blot-
ting. In our laboratory, we use anti-luciferase antibodies (rabbit 
polyclonal anti-luciferase, Sigma), which recognize both NLuc 
and CLuc.

Abstract 
Protein–protein interactions play a critical role in plant viral infection and defense responses against 
pathogens. This protocol provides a detailed and reliable methodology for investigating protein–protein 
interactions using a luciferase-based complementation assay that includes easy luminescence-based normal-
ization within a single plate. The protocol includes step-by-step procedures, reagent lists, and considera-
tions for data interpretation, ensuring robust and reproducible results. By following this protocol, 
researchers can advance on understanding of the crucial role of protein–protein interactions in plant viral 
infection and defense responses to other pathogen attacks.

Introduction 
Protein–protein interactions are crucial in plant viral infection, as 
well as in the plant’s defense response to viral attacks. Plants have 
evolved pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that recognize 
pathogen-associated 
molecular 
patterns 
(PAMPs), 
triggering 
defense responses. Plant immunity can also be inhibited by viral 
proteins. For example, the Begomovirus nuclear shuttle protein 
(NSP) interacts with the Arabidopsis receptor-like kinase (RLK) 
NSP-interacting kinase 1 (NIK1) to suppress the activation of 
antiviral responses [1, 2]. 
Various methodologies are used to detect and measure interac-
tions between two or more proteins. Co-immunoprecipitation 
(Co-IP), yeast two-hybrid (Y2H), and bimolecular ﬂuorescence 
complementation (BiFC) are examples of methodologies that use 
antibodies [3], domains of interaction with reporter genes [4], and 
reconstitution of ﬂuorescent proteins [5], respectively, to detect 
protein interactions. However, these methods have some limita-
tions in speciﬁc contexts or for certain types of data, such as the

differences in study organisms, microscopy limitations, and the 
inability to quantify interactions. Therefore, the split-luciferase 
assay has emerged as an attractive alternative methodology to over-
come some these limitations.

The split-luciferase assay is a protein-protein interaction assay 
that relies on the reconstitution of a luciferase enzyme. The pro-
teins of interest are fused to the N-terminal (nLUC) and 
C-terminal (cLUC) fragments of a luciferase enzyme. If these 
proteins interact, the nLUC and cLUC fragments are brought 
into proximity, allowing them to reconstitute a functional luciferase 
enzyme that emits light when luciferin, the substrate, is added. For 
studies in yeast, the split-luciferase assay can be performed in either 
the cytoplasm or nucleus of the yeast cell [6]. For studies in mam-
malian cells, the split-luciferase assay can be performed in various 
cell lines, including HEK293, COS-7, and HeLa cells [7]. The 
split-luciferase assay in plants is commonly conducted in Nicotiana 
benthamiana (N. benthamiana) leaves due to their high expression 
capacity and ease of inﬁltration [8–12]. 
In addition to being highly sensitive, the assay is also quantita-
tive and can be conducted in real time using protein quantiﬁcation 
techniques. For example, the HiBiT tag is an 11 amino acid peptide 
sequence that can be fused to a protein of interest, allowing detec-
tion and quantiﬁcation of the protein. In split-luciferase assays 
using ﬂoated leaf disks, the HiBiT tag can be used as an internal 
control to normalize the variability in protein amounts and assay 
performance [13, 14]. However, certain points need to be carefully 
determined prior to the experiment, such as the selection of lucif-
erase fragments and their proper positioning. When working with 
membrane proteins, the effectiveness of the split-luciferase assay 
may be reduced due to the limited accessibility of the split frag-
ments across the membrane barrier. To address this issue, one 
fragment can be fused to the cytoplasmic domain of a membrane 
protein, while the other fragment is fused to a soluble protein 
partner. This design enables the split-luciferase fragments to come 
into proximity within the membrane, minimizing interference from 
membrane lipids. 
Several studies have demonstrated the utility of split-luciferase 
assays in detecting protein–protein interactions in plants. For exam-
ple, the interaction between glycosyltransferases in the Golgi appa-
ratus was conﬁrmed using split-luciferase assays in Nicotiana leaves 
[15]. Wang et al. (2020) used split-luciferase assays in Arabidopsis 
protoplasts to elucidate the heterodimerization of chitin receptor 
homologs [16]. In this protocol (Fig. 1), the strong interaction 
between the Arabidopsis thaliana heterotrimeric G-protein α sub-
unit (AtGPA1) and its regulator, regulator of G signaling 
1 (AtRGS1), as well as the weak-interacting mutant AtRGS1E320K 
(Fig. 2)  [17]. These interactions were already conﬁrmed through

Fig. 1 Split-luciferase assay protocol in N. benthamiana leaf disks. (a) Construct selection. The coding 
sequences of the ﬁreﬂy luciferase (FLUC) N-terminal fragment (nLUC) and luciferase C-terminal fragment 
(cLUC) are ampliﬁed with the HiBiT small tag and cloned into respective plant expression vectors. (b) 
Agrobacterium transformation and co-inﬁltration. Agrobacterium strains are transformed by electroporation 
and clones carrying HiBiT-nLUC- and cLUC-fused constructs are transformed into N. benthamiana leaves via 
vacuum inﬁltration. Co-inﬁltration is performed by mixing equal volumes of Agrobacterium cultures expressing 
both complementary constructs. (c) Incubation and protein expression. Inﬁltrated plants are kept in the dark 
overnight and then cultivated for an additional 48 h under normal growth conditions. During this time, nLUC 
and cLUC proteins are expected to be expressed and interact to reconstitute functional luciferase. (d) Plate 
design and preparation. Leaf disks are excised from inﬁltrated leaves and placed on a 96-well white 
microplate. Proper plate design and preparation, including appropriate wells for HiBiT protein concentration 
control, must be ensured to obtain accurate luciferase activity measurements. (e) Plate reading and HiBiT 
normalization. Luminescence signals from the leaf disks are measured using a luminometer at a wavelength 
of 560 nm. HiBiT normalization is performed by dividing the luciferase activity by the concentration of the 
variable protein. Data are analyzed to determine protein–protein interaction strength based on normalized 
luciferase activity levels

other protein–protein interaction methodologies, such as BiFC and 
microscale thermophoresis (MST) [17–20].

Notes 
1. As exempliﬁed here, Gateway® vectors can be employed for 
split-luciferase assays, as they facilitate efﬁcient cloning and 
expression of fusion proteins and tags, which can aid in protein 
quantiﬁcation [22, 23]. There are a few plant expression vec-
tors available for this assay. Here, we have used cauliﬂower 
mosaic virus 35S-based plasmids [10, 11]. Additionally, 
HCPro [24] may be used as an alternative to the p19 silencing 
suppressor [21]. 
2. Agrobacterium clones must be transformed with a minimum 
interval from transfection once it directly inﬂuences on the 
plant expression of exogenous constructs; culture volume will 
depend on the number of leaves to inﬁltrate. 
3. N. benthamiana plants grow well at 25 °C in a long-day 
photoperiod (16 h light/8 h dark). 
4. While a syringe needle can be used to make a small cut in the 
underside of a leaf for easier inﬁltration, it is not recommended 
to use it for the actual inﬁltration process. This is because doing 
so can cause more damage to the leaf and affect the accuracy of 
measurements. 
5. Do not inﬁltrate more than two leaves per plant; different 
constructs may be compared in the same plant for better ran-
domization. Leaves from the same age must be used for 
comparison.

254
Eduardo Bassi Simoni and Ce´ lio Cabral Oliveira
6. Protein expression time may vary depending on the intrinsic 
characteristics of the protein or the conditions, but constant 
parameters are recommended during the experiment and 
repetitions. 
7. Leaf disk strikers must be cleaned and constantly sharpened 
with the appropriate tools, and leaf disks must be carefully 
placed into the well with tweezers to avoid leaf damage. 
8. It is recommended to add the positive control (RGS1-nLUC 
here) to all the plates if more than one comparison is being 
made. This will avoid plate or equipment-related errors. 
9. In a split-luciferase assay, luminescence can be measured at a 
speciﬁc time point after initiating the assay or at the point of 
maximum luminescence. The decision on when to measure 
luminescence depends on the experimental design and study 
objectives. While speciﬁc time point measurement can be more 
efﬁcient, as it may not require waiting for maximum lumines-
cence. It may not capture the full extent of the protein–protein 
interaction and may require optimization to determine the 
optimal time point. On the other hand, measuring maximum 
luminescence can capture the full extent of the interaction but 
may be more time-consuming. 
10. Another approach to quantify luciferase protein levels is 
through western blotting using a speciﬁc antibody against the 
protein. Commercial nLUC and cLUC antibodies may be 
optimized once. 
11. The choice of measurement protocol generally depends on the 
experimental design, study objectives, and practical considera-
tions such as time and resources available.

TurboID-Based Proximity Labeling: A Method to Decipher 
Protein–Protein Interactions in Plants 
Yuanyuan Li, Yongliang Zhang, and Savithramma P. Dinesh-Kumar 
Abstract 
Proteins form complex networks through interaction to drive biological processes. Thus, dissecting 
protein–protein interactions (PPIs) is essential for interpreting cellular processes. To overcome the draw-
backs of traditional approaches for analyzing PPIs, enzyme-catalyzed proximity labeling (PL) techniques 
based on peroxidases or biotin ligases have been developed and successfully utilized in mammalian systems. 
However, the use of toxic H2O2 in peroxidase-based PL, the requirement of long incubation time 
(16–24 h), and higher incubation temperature (37 °C) with biotin in BioID-based PL signiﬁcantly 
restricted their applications in plants. TurboID-based PL, a recently developed approach, circumvents the 
limitations of these methods by providing rapid PL of proteins under room temperature. We recently 
optimized the use of TurboID-based PL in plants and demonstrated that it performs better than BioID in 
labeling endogenous proteins. Here, we describe a step-by-step protocol for TurboID-based PL in studying 
PPIs in planta, including Agrobacterium-based transient expression of proteins, biotin treatment, protein 
extraction, removal of free biotin, quantiﬁcation, and enrichment of the biotinylated proteins by afﬁnity 
puriﬁcation. We describe the PL using plant viral immune receptor N, which belongs to the nucleotide-
binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) class of immune receptors, as a model. The method described could be 
easily adapted to study PPI networks of other proteins in Nicotiana benthamiana and provides valuable 
information for future application of TurboID-based PL in other plant species.

Introduction 
Plant viruses are simple, obligate, and intracellular parasites. Due to 
their small genome size, plant viruses usually encode limited num-
bers of proteins. To successfully establish a viral infection cycle in 
host plants, plant viruses rely on various host machineries consisting 
of proteins, nucleic acids, membranes, and metabolites [1]. There-
fore, dissecting molecular networks of plant–virus interactions is 
important for understanding the mechanism of viral infection and 
the defense responses against viruses by the host plant. Among

them, protein–protein interactions (PPIs) have attracted the most 
interest because PPIs are intrinsically involved in almost all cellular 
functions and biological processes.
258
Yuanyuan Li et al.
Traditional approaches, including yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) 
screening and antibody-based afﬁnity puriﬁcation coupled with 
mass spectrometry (AP-MS), have been widely applied to identify 
PPIs 
during 
plant–virus 
interactions 
[2]. 
However, 
both 
approaches suffer from some disadvantages. For example, although 
Y2H screening is a high throughput method, it is a heterologous 
system and may have false positives due to overexpression of pro-
teins. Those PPIs with cell and organelle type restrictions may not 
take place in the heterologous yeast system [3]. Furthermore, Y2H 
screening requires available high-quality libraries of the target plant 
species, constructions of which are labor-intensive and costly. The 
afﬁnity puriﬁcation approach allows the enrichment of stable inter-
actions between the protein of interest and its partners in plant 
cells, but it suffers from capturing the transient or weak PPIs due to 
stringent cell lysis conditions and the subsequent washing steps 
typically used in AP [4]. Afﬁnity puriﬁcation is also unsuitable for 
insoluble proteins or targets with low abundance. These limita-
tions, therefore, greatly hamper our understanding of the protein 
interaction networks in plant–virus interactions. 
Enzyme-catalyzed proximity labeling (PL) is an approach 
developed for mapping molecular interaction networks [5]. Gener-
ally, an engineered enzyme fused to the protein of interest can 
produce short-lived reactive biotin species, such as radical and 
activated ester, to preferentially label proximal proteins within a 
certain radius (<20 nm) [6]  (see Fig. 1). Because the proximate 
proteins are covalently tagged with biotin, the cells/tissue expres-
sing the fusion protein can be lysed under harsh conditions, result-
ing in efﬁcient disruption and solubilization of membranes and 
protein complexes. Subsequently, labeled proteins are enriched by 
streptavidin-based afﬁnity puriﬁcation and analyzed by mass spec-
trometry (MS) (see Fig. 2). The high afﬁnity of streptavidin–biotin 
interaction also allows stringent washing steps to remove false 
positives. PL compensates for the drawbacks of the traditional 
approaches for identifying PPIs as it enables the capture of weak 
and transient interactions and insoluble protein complexes in their 
native cellular environment. Two major groups of enzymes com-
monly utilized for proximity-dependent biotinylation are peroxi-
dases and biotin ligases. Peroxidases [such as ascorbate peroxidase 
2 (APEX2), horseradish peroxidase (HRP)] generate biotin-
phenoxyl radicals in the presence of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) 
[7, 8]  (see Fig. 1a). Wild-type biotin ligases convert biotin to the 
reactive biotin-adenosine-5′-monophosphoester (biotinoyl-AMP) 
intermediate and catalyze the direct transfer of activated biotin to a 
speciﬁc lysine residues of the target protein. Promiscuous biotin 
ligases (BioID, BioID2, BASU, TurboID, miniTurboID, and

UltraID) modiﬁed from the wild-type enzymes have low afﬁnity for 
the intermediate, allowing the generated intermediates diffuse out 
of the enzyme active site, and covalently biotinylate proximal pro-
teins [9–12] (see Fig. 1b). 
TurboID-Based Proximity Labeling to Identify PPI in Planta

Fig. 1 Schematic of peroxidase- and biotin ligase-based proximity labeling. (a) Peroxidases, such as APEX or 
HRP, oxidize biotin–phenol into reactive radicals in the presence of H2O2, which labels proximal endogenous 
proteins. (b) Biotin ligases, such as BioID or TurboID, catalyze the formation of reactive biotin-AMP from biotin, 
which diffuses and labels proximal endogenous proteins 
Although APEX offers rapid labeling kinetics (within minutes), 
the requirement of toxic H2O2 during labeling and high endoge-
nous plant peroxidase activity make it unsuitable for PL studies in 
plants [7, 8]. In contrast, the biotin ligases provide simple and 
nontoxic labeling. BioID, a mutant of Escherichia coli biotin ligase 
BirA, represents the ﬁrst generation of biotin ligase developed for 
PL. Compared to peroxidase-based PL, BioID requires 18–24 h for 
efﬁcient labeling, making it difﬁcult to capture transient PPIs. 
Moreover, the higher incubation temperature (37 °C) required by

BioID is not optimal for in vivo PL in plants [11]. To reduce the 
interference with trafﬁcking and function of the fusion protein, 
BioID2, a smaller biotin ligase derived from the Aquifex aeolicus 
was developed [10]. However, BioID2 requires the same labeling 
conditions as BioID, resulting in limited utilities of BioID/ 
BioID2-based PL in plants [13–17]. Recently, new promiscuous 
biotin ligase variants of E. coli BirA, TurboID, and miniTurboID 
have been generated using yeast display-based directed evolution 
[9]. TurboID and miniTurboID have much higher catalytic activity 
than BioID or BioID2, allowing rapid nontoxic PL within 10 min 
under room temperature.

Fig. 2 Example workﬂow for mapping PPIs using TurboID-based proximity labeling method in N. benthamiana. 
TurboID fused to the protein of interest and a reference control are expressed in separate plants by 
agroinﬁltration. 36 h post-inﬁltration, 200 μM biotin is inﬁltrated into the same leaves to initiate the proximity 
labeling of endogenous proteins. The inﬁltrated leaves were harvested after 1–12 h of incubation at RT and 
followed by grinding in liquid nitrogen. Proteins were extracted using a lysis buffer, such as RIPA lysis buffer, 
and a desalting column was employed to remove the free biotin in the extract. The biotinylated proteins were 
then afﬁnity-puriﬁed with streptavidin-conjugated beads and identiﬁed via quantitative mass spectrometry. 
LC-MS/MS, liquid chromatography, and tandem mass spectrometry. (Reproduced from ref. [28] with permis-

TurboID-based PL has been successfully conducted in a variety 
of cell types and organisms [18–25]. We and others recently opti-
mized the utility of TurboID-based PL for PPIs studies in different 
plant systems such as N. benthamiana, Arabidopsis, and tomato 
[26–28]. TurboID showed a better PL performance than BioID in 
plants under room temperature [27, 28]. We used this method to 
identify interactors of plant viral immune receptor N that belong to 
the nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) class of immune

receptors [28]. N contains toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) 
homology domain at the N-terminus [29]. In this chapter, the 
detailed procedures for TurboID-based investigation of PPIs in 
planta are described, using the interactome analysis of the TIR 
domain of N NLR immune receptor in N. benthamiana as an 
example [28, 30]. With some recently published studies [26, 27, 
31, 32], it is expected that the application of this approach can be 
extended to other plant species and will serve as a powerful tool for 
PPIs studies in planta.

Methods 
3.1 
Growth of Plant
1. Sow N. benthamiana seeds at high density (about 40 seeds) 
into a pot ﬁlled with wet soil and place it in a plastic growing 
tray covered with a transparent humidity dome. Maintain them 
in a growth chamber with a photoperiod of 16 h light/8 h dark 
(75 μmol/m2 /s) at 23–25 °C and 40–60% humidity. 
2. After 1 week, carefully transfer each germinated seedling to a 
3.5′ × 3.5′ pot ﬁlled with wet soil and maintain plants in the 
same growth chamber for 3–4 weeks. 
3.2 
Plasmid 
Construction 
1. Use a standard molecular cloning method to fuse the gene of 
interest in-frame with TurboID vectors (Addgene plasmids 
#199243; #199244). Here, we made a construct expressing 
TurboID-fused to TIR domain of N NLR immune receptor 
driven by cauliﬂower mosaic virus 35S promoter (p35S::TIR-
TurboID-3xHA) [28] (see Note 4). 
2. Generate a construct expressing TurboID-fused to citrine 
driven by the same promoter (p35S::Citrine-TurboID-3xHA) 
to serve as the control for subsequent quantitative analysis (see 
Note 5).

3. Conﬁrm the sequence of all the constructs by Sanger 
sequencing. 
3.3 
Agroinﬁltration 
and Biotin Treatment 
1. Transform 
the 
plasmids 
from 
Subheading 
3.2 
into 
A. tumefaciens strains GV3101 separately [33] (see Note 1). 
3.3.1 
Agroinﬁltration
2. Pick and streak Agrobacterium colony harboring the construct 
onto a fresh LB agar plate supplemented with appropriate 
antibiotics to select the plasmid, as well as for the Agrobacter-
ium (for GV3101: 50 mg/L gentamicin and 50 mg/L rifam-
picin) and grow at 28 °C overnight (see Note 6). 
3. Inoculate Agrobacterium harboring the construct into 3 mL of 
LB medium with appropriate antibiotics (see step 2) and incu-
bate by shaking at 28 °C in a shaker overnight until the OD600 
reaches approximately 2.0. 
4. Collect Agrobacterium cells by centrifugation at 3000×g, 
10 min, and resuspend the pellet in agroinﬁltration media to 
OD600 = 1.0 (see Note 7). 
5. Use a 1 mL needleless syringe to inﬁltrate the suspensions into 
the fully mature leaves of 3- to 4-week-old N. benthamiana 
through the (abaxial) epidermis (see Note 8). 
6. Maintain plants in the growth chamber (see Subheading 3.1, 
step 1). 
3.3.2 
Biotin Treatment
1. At 36 h post-inﬁltration (hpi) (see Note 9), inﬁltrate 200 μM 
biotin 
(in 
10 
mM 
MgCl2 
solution) 
into 
the 
leaves 
pre-inﬁltrated with TurboID constructs (see Note 10). 
2. Maintain the plant for an additional 1–12 h in the growth 
chamber (see Subheading 3.1, step 1) before sample collection 
(see Note 11). 
3.4 
Protein 
Extraction 
To minimize keratin contamination, the subsequent procedure 
should be processed in keratin-free condition, wear powder-free 
sterile gloves, and keep all reagents keratin-free when possible. 
1. Cut off the inﬁltrated leaves from the base of the petiole, 
remove the leaf vein, and then ﬂash-freeze the tissue in liquid 
nitrogen (see Note 12). 
2. Grind the collected tissue in liquid nitrogen with a pestle and 
mortar into a ﬁne powder, and store in 15-mL or 50-mL 
Falcon tubes at -80 °C for subsequent use. Verify expression 
and biotinylation of proteins by western blot (see Note 13). 
Typical western blot results are shown in Fig. 3. 
3. Transfer 0.35 g of tissue powder into a 2.0-mL Eppendorf 
tube. Prepare two tubes for each sample (0.7 g/sample in 
total).

4. Add 700 μL of RIPA lysis buffer to each tube containing 0.35 g 
tissue powder. 
5. Vortex for 10 min to mix thoroughly. 
6. Leave the mixture on ice for 30 min. Mix the contents every 
4–5 min by turning the tubes upside down several times. 
7. Centrifuge at 16,500×g for 10 min at 4 °C. 
8. Combine the supernatant from two tubes of the same sample 
and transfer it into a new 2.0-mL Eppendorf tube. 
9. Take out 50 μL aliquot and store at -80 °C for subsequent 
immunoblot analysis of target proteins in the leaf extracts. Keep 
the rest samples on ice temporarily. 
3.5 
Removal of Free 
Biotin Using a 
Desalting Column 
This usually takes 30–50 min. To save time, column equilibration 
can be done during the protein extraction (Subheading 3.4, steps 
6–9). The protocol given here is for Zeba™ Spin Desalting 
Columns. 
3.5.1 
Equilibrate the 
Desalting Column
1. Remove the desalting column’s bottom sealing material, 
loosen cap (do not remove cap). 
2. Place the column into a collection tube (50-mL Falcon tube) 
and centrifuge at 1000×g for 2 min at 4 °C to remove the 
storage solution (see Note 14). 
3. Discard ﬂowthrough and replace the column back into the 
collection tube. Add 5 mL of RIPA lysis buffer on top of the

266
Yuanyuan Li et al.
resin. Centrifuge at 1000×g for 2 min at 4 °C and discard the 
ﬂowthrough. 
4. Repeat step 3 two additional times. 
5. Blot the bottom of the column or plate to remove excess liquid. 
Transfer the column to a new collection 50-mL Falcon tube. 
6. Store temporarily at 4 °C. 
3.5.2 
Desalting the 
Protein Extracts 
1. Apply 1400–1500 μL of protein extract on top of the resin of 
the equilibrated desalting column (from Subheading 3.4, step 
9) (see Note 15). 
2. Add a stacker (another 100 μL of RIPA lysis buffer) on top of 
the resin as soon as the added sample has completely entered 
the resin (see Note 16). 
3. Centrifuge at 1000×g for 2 min at 4 °C. 
4. Keep the ﬂowthrough (desalted protein extracts) on ice tem-
porarily. Discard the column. 
3.6 
Quantiﬁcation of 
the Desalted Protein 
Extracts Using a 
Bradford Assay (See 
Note 17) 
1. Prepare a set of diluted BSA standards (50 μL each): 0 mg/mL, 
0.2 mg/mL, 0.4 mg/mL, 0.6 mg/mL, 0.8 mg/mL, and 
1 mg/mL. 
2. Dilute the desalted protein extract by mixing 5 μL of the 
sample with 45 μL of ddH2O. 
3. Prepare 1 × Bradford regent by diluting the 5 × Bradford 
regent with ddH2O. 
4. Pipette 50 μL of each BSA standard and diluted protein extract 
into an appropriately labeled test tube. 
5. Add 2.5 mL of 1 × Bradford regent into each tube and 
mix well. 
6. Incubate at RT for 10 min. 
7. Add 200 μL of solution from each tube to a well of the ELISA 
plate (three technical replicates per sample). 
8. Measure the 562 nm absorbance using a microplate reader (see 
Note 18). 
9. Prepare the standard curve by plotting the average Blank-
corrected 562 nm measurement for each BSA standard vs. its 
concentration in μg/mL. Use the standard curve to calculate 
the concentration of each desalted protein sample (see Note 
19). 
10. Use 6–8 mg of desalted protein extract for subsequent bioti-
nylated protein enrichment.

Fig. 4 Immunoblot analysis of the biotinylated proteins captured on Streptavidin 
beads in Subheading 3.7.2, step 13 to conﬁrm the enrichment of the biotinylated 
proteins. There are three independent replicates for each protein (reproduced 
from ref. [28] with permission from Nature Springer). Generally, citrine 
expresses at higher level, and hence, there is more cis-biotinylation in Citrine-
TurboID samples 
13. Take out 100 μL of beads for immunoblot analysis to conﬁrm 
the enrichment of biotinylated proteins. A typical western blot 
is shown in Fig. 4. 
14. Flash-freeze the rest of the protein samples and store them at -
80 °C or send them immediately for liquid chromatography– 
tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis on dry ice 
(see Note 21).

Notes 
1. Other Agrobacterium strains, such as EHA105, GV2260, and 
C58CI, can also be used. 
2. Biotin is a carboxylic acid, and as such it is less soluble under 
acidic conditions, but more soluble in DMSO and dilutes 
alkali. Biotin stock can also be prepared in DMSO. 
3. PD-10 columns (GE Healthcare) can also be used for free 
biotin removal (see ref. [26]). It will be better to compare the 
efﬁciency of these columns. 
4. The TurboID fusion should not interfere with the function or 
localization of the protein. Previously characterized functional 
fusion with ﬂuorescent protein or epitope tag can be a 
promising indicator of whether TurboID should be fused to

TurboID-Based Proximity Labeling to Identify PPI in Planta

the C- and N-terminus of protein. Usually, for cytoplasmic 
proteins, both termini should be acceptable. However, for 
membrane-localized proteins, the protein topology needs to 
be characterized in advance. If unsure, make and test both 
versions. 
5. It is important to include a TurboID fusion control for validat-
ing the proximal proteins to the protein of interest. The control 
should be expressed at a level similar to that of the TurboID-
fused target protein. This can be empirically determined by 
adjusting the Agrobacterium concentration during agroinﬁltra-
tion. In addition, it is important that the control protein and 
the target protein of interest share a similar subcellular localiza-
tion pattern or at least the control protein’s subcellular distri-
bution covers or encompasses the space that the TurboID 
fusion touches. 
6. It is more optimal to conﬁrm the presence of the speciﬁc binary 
construct in the Agrobacterium by colony PCR. 
7. Although it is optimal to incubate the inoculum in the inﬁltra-
tion media for 2–3 h prior to agroinﬁltration at RT, based on 
our experience with GV3101, there is no difference between 
the protein expression with and without preincubation. The 
preincubation requirement for other Agrobacterium strains 
needs to be veriﬁed. 
8. To prepare enough leaf materials for three biological replicates, 
we suggest inﬁltrating three to four plants per construct. Each 
plant has three entire leaves inﬁltrated. For each leaf, 
1.5–2.0 
mL 
of 
resuspended 
Agrobacterium 
should 
be 
sufﬁcient. 
9. The reason for picking 36 hpi for biotin inﬁltration is that, 
according to our previous studies [28], the protein of interest 
reaches its peak expression at this time point. It is recom-
mended to determine the time required for optimal expression 
of the protein of interest. 
10. A comparable biotinylation level of TurboID-fused bait pro-
tein and its proximate proteins should be achieved with the 
addition of 50–200 μM biotin. It is reported that increasing 
the biotin concentration from 50 μM to 2 mM adversely 
affected the capture of proximate proteins, as only the bait 
itself could be identiﬁed. This is probably due to high residual 
free biotin accumulated in the protein extract even after desalt-
ing, thus occupying the streptavidin binding sites on the beads 
(see ref. [26]). 
11. The incubation time post-biotin inﬁltration depends on the 
features of the bait protein and the experimental design. Usu-
ally, longer biotin incubation time clearly increases the robust-
ness of PL, but 1–12 h of biotin treatment should be sufﬁcient

270
Yuanyuan Li et al.
for the labeling of most proteins proximal to the bait protein by 
the TurboID fusions. 
12. Harvest three to four pieces of leaves for each biological repli-
cate from different plants. Wear gloves when handling liquid 
nitrogen or operating any object cooled by liquid nitrogen. 
13. The protocol can be paused here. Prior to subsequent steps, it 
is recommended to verify protein expression and biotinylation 
of the target protein by immunoblot analyses. 
14. After each spin, the resin should appear white and free of 
liquid. If a liquid is present, make sure you are using the correct 
centrifugation speed and time. Some models of centrifuge will 
time down right after pushing the “Start” button, but here 
requires timed runs at speed. Incomplete centrifugation may 
result in poor sample recovery or sample dilution. 
15. A combination of the samples from each group, as described in 
Subheading 3.4 can result in at least 1500 μL of protein extract 
per sample, as the total volume after protein extraction was 
invariably increased to some extent relative to the original 
volume of added RIPA lysis buffer. 
16. Adding a stacker is optional but recommended for dilute pro-
tein solutions or small sample volumes to ensure maximum 
sample recovery. 
17. Other protein quantiﬁcation methods, such as BCA, can also 
be used. 
18. A spectrometer with an appropriate wavelength range com-
bined with the use of cuvettes can be an alternative for measur-
ing 562 nm absorbance. 
19. Usually, the total protein concentration obtained from 0.7 g of 
leaves ranges from 3 to 6 mg/mL. 
20. Collect beads from the lid of the tubes by brief centrifugation 
each time before placing them on the magnetic separation rack. 
21. Typical MS results can be found in our previous publication (see 
ref. [28] Fig. 2, Supplementary Data 1, and Supplementary

Virus-Induced Heritable Gene Editing in Plants 
Ugrappa Nagalakshmi, Nathan Meier, and Savithramma P. Dinesh-Kumar 
Abstract 
Gene editing using clustered, regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-
associated (Cas) nuclease is an excellent tool for assessing gene function in plants. However, delivery of 
CRISPR/Cas-editing components into plant cells is still a major bottleneck and requires tissue culture-
based approaches and regeneration of plants. To overcome this limitation, several plant viral vectors have 
recently been engineered to deliver single-guide RNA (sgRNA) targets into SpCas9-expressing plants. 
Here, we describe an optimized, step-by-step protocol based on the tobacco rattle virus (TRV)-based 
vector system to deliver sgRNAs fused to mobile tRNA sequences for efﬁcient heritable editing in Nicoti-
ana benthamiana and Arabidopsis thaliana model systems. The protocol described here could be adopted 
to study the function of any gene of interest.

Introduction 
The discovery and development of clustered, regularly interspaced 
short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated (Cas) 
nucleases for targeted genome editing over the last decade, have 
revolutionized gene function studies in many organisms, including 
plants [1, 2]. In plants, delivery of Cas nucleases and single-guide 
RNA (sgRNA) targeted to edit genes is generally accomplished 
through Agrobacterium-mediated plant transformation or direct 
delivery to protoplasts followed by plant regeneration. These 
approaches, which depend on tissue culture, are time-consuming 
and labor-intensive. In addition, many plants are recalcitrant to 
transformation or regeneration. 
One approach to delivering CRISPR/Cas-editing components 
without transgenics is through viral vectors. Over the last four 
decades, engineered plant viral vectors have been a great tool in 
various fundamental and translational studies in plant biology 
[3]. Various plant viral vectors have been engineered and used to

knock down the expression of genes through virus-induced gene 
silencing (VIGS) and to express proteins, including those for bio-
technological purposes [3–10]. Many plant viral vectors have 
recently 
been 
engineered 
to 
deliver

editing 
reagents 
[11, 12]. Many vectors can efﬁciently deliver sgRNAs into 
SpCas9-expressing plants for gene editing without requiring tissue 
culture. In most cases, viral vector-mediated delivery of sgRNAs has 
either not been shown to induce heritable gene editing or shown to 
induce low-efﬁciency heritable editing.

Ugrappa Nagalakshmi et al.
An RNA virus, tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), has been used to 
deliver SpCas9 and sgRNA to induce gene editing transiently in the 
inﬁltrated leaves of N. benthamiana [13]. However, TMV with 
SpCas9 or sgRNA is unable to move from initial inﬁltrated leaves 
into systemic tissue [13]. Another RNA virus, potato virus X 
(PVX), has been used to deliver SpCas9 and sgRNA into 
N. benthamiana leaves [14] and one or more sgRNAs into 
N. benthamiana expressing SpCas9 [15] to induce high-efﬁciency 
somatic editing. However, in both cases, tissue culture was used to 
regenerate edited plants from PVX-infected tissues [14, 15]. 
We recently used an RNA virus, tobacco rattle virus (TRV), to 
develop 
a 
TRV-based 
vector 
to 
deliver 
sgRNAs 
into 
N. benthamiana plants expressing SpCas9. This induced efﬁcient 
somatic editing; however, editing was very low [16]. Another virus 
related to TRV, pea early browning virus (PEBV), has been used to 
express sgRNAs in transgenic N. benthamiana and Arabidopsis 
thaliana Col-0 plants expressing SpCas9 [17]. However, the heri-
table transmission of PEBV-mediated gene editing was not 
reported in this study. 
In collaboration with the Voytas group at University of Min-
nesota, our group recently showed that adding phloem mobile 
RNA sequences that are known to move to the shoot apical meri-
stem into the sgRNAs can greatly enhance heritable editing efﬁ-
ciency [18]. TRV vector-based expression of sgRNAs augmented 
with mobile RNA sequences such as Arabidopsis Flowering Locus T 
(AtFT), tRNA methionine (tRNAMet ), and tRNA isoleucine 
(tRNAIle ) induced high-efﬁciency somatic editing in the SpCas9-
expressing N. benthamiana plants and 65–100% heritable biallelic 
editing in the next generation [18]. These ﬁndings demonstrated 
that expression of sgRNAs augmented with mobile RNA sequences 
using TRV vector; one could obtain biallelic heritable mutations in 
a single generation with high efﬁciency. 
Recently, we showed that TRV augmented with tRNAIleu also 
induces high-efﬁciency somatic and heritable editing in Arabidopsis 
[19]. Furthermore, the TRV with tRNAIleu can induce high-
efﬁciency heritable base-edits in Arabidopsis [20], and TRV with 
sgRNA ﬂanked by self-splicing tRNA can induce epigene editing in 
Arabidopsis [21]. Expression of sgRNAs fused to AtFT using PVX 
has also been shown to induce heritable editing with 22% efﬁciency

in N. benthamiana [15]. In N. attenuata, TRV-based delivery of 
sgRNA induced heritable editing only in plants that expressed Cas9 
under Ribosomal protein S5 A (RPS5A) promoter that is known to 
be active in meristematic cells but not in plants that expressed 
SpCas9 under cauliﬂower mosaic virus 35S promoter [22]. 
Heritable Gene Editing in Plants Using Viruses
275
Among DNA viruses, geminiviral non-infectious DNA repli-
cons have been used to enhance gene editing frequency when 
expressed in the transgenic Nicotiana sp, wheat, potato, and 
tomato plants [23–29]. In addition, a modiﬁed cabbage leaf curl 
geminivirus (CabLCV) vector has been used to deliver sgRNA into 
transgenic 
N. 
benthamiana 
plants 
expressing 
SpCas9 
[30]. Although this vector can induce editing of target genes in 
the newly emerging leaves, the heritable transmission of mutations 
is not possible with this system [30]. The geminivirus cotton leaf 
crumple virus (CLCrV) expressing a sgRNA fused to N terminus 
102 bp of AtFT has been shown to induce low-efﬁciency heritable 
editing in Arabidopsis, but only in the second generation 
(M2) [31]. 
Currently, few engineered viruses have been shown to deliver 
sgRNAs into Cas9-expressing monocot plants. Among these, only 
the barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV) has been shown to induce 
heritable editing in wheat [32–34]. BSMV and foxtail mosaic virus 
(FoMV) have been shown to induce somatic editing in SpCas9-
expressing maize, but no heritable editing was observed [35–37]. 
The RNA and DNA viruses discussed above can deliver 
sgRNAs but not Cas nucleases because of the limited cargo capacity 
of these viruses. Recently, a plant-negative strand virus, sonchus 
yellow net nucleorhabdovirus (SYNV)-based vector, has been engi-
neered to deliver both SpCas9 nuclease and sgRNAs into 
N. benthamiana plants [38]. Although the SYNV-based approach 
can induce efﬁcient somatic editing, the heritable edits could be 
recovered only through the regeneration of plants from SYNV-
infected somatic tissue [38]. 
Here, we describe a detailed protocol for heritable gene editing 
using a TRV-based vector in SpCas9 expressing N. benthamiana 
(hereafter referred to as N. benthamiana::SpCas9) and Arabidopsis 
thaliana (hereafter referred to as Arabidopsis::SpCas9) plants based 
on our recent reports [18, 19]. The method we describe here can 
easily be adapted to study gene function in these plants.

Introducing TRV 
Constructs into 
Agrobacterium 
1. For Editing in N. benthamiana::SpCas9 Plants: Transform 
pTRV1, SPDK3860 (positive control), SPDK3888 (negative 
control), and SPDK3888 + sgRNA target generated in Sub-
heading 3.2 separately into A. tumefaciens strain GV2260 
using the freeze–thaw method of transformation. Brieﬂy, add 
500 ng of plasmid DNA into 50 μL GV2260 competent cells 
and incubate on ice for 30 min. Put the tubes in a ﬂoater into 
liquid nitrogen. After 1 min, move the tubes to 37 °C water 
bath for 5 min. Add 250 μL LB liquid media and incubate in a 
28 °C shaker for 2–2.5 h. Plate 100–150 μL onto a fresh LB 
agar plate with KSRC antibiotics (50 mg/L kanamycin,

280
Ugrappa Nagalakshmi et al.
50 mg/L streptomycin, 25 mg/L rifampicin, and 50 mg/L 
carbenicillin) and grow at 28 °C for 2–3 days. Pick and streak 
two colonies onto a fresh KSRC containing LB agar plate and 
grow at 28 °C overnight. Inoculate 2 mL LB liquid culture 
with KSRC, grow overnight at 28 °C, make glycerol stocks, 
and store at -80 °C (see Note 8). 
2. For Editing in Arabidopsis::SpCas9 Plants: Transform pTRV1, 
SPDK3959 (positive control), SPDK3888 (negative control), 
and SPDK3888 + sgRNA target generated in Subheading 3.2 
separately into 50 μL of  A. tumefaciens GV3101 competent 
cells using heat-shock method similar to the one used for 
transformation of E. coli. Add 250 μL LB liquid media and 
incubate in a shaker at 28 °C for 1 h. Plate 100–150 μL cells 
onto LB agar plate with KRG antibiotics (50 mg/L kanamycin, 
25 mg/L rifampicin, and 50 mg/L gentamicin) and grow at 
28 °C for 2 days. Pick and streak two colonies onto a fresh LB 
plate with KRG antibiotics and incubate overnight at 28 °C. 
Make glycerol stock and store at -80 °C.

Editing Target 
Gene of Interest in N. 
benthamiana::SpCas9 
Plants 
The steps involved in generating heritable editing in the target gene 
of interest using N. benthamiana::SpCas9 plants and TRV system 
are summarized in Fig. 3. 
3.4.1 
Inﬁltration of 
Agrobacterium Harboring 
TRV Constructs into N. 
benthamiana::SpCas9 
Plants 
1. Streak 
out 
Agrobacterium 
GV2260 
containing 
pTRV1, 
SPDK3860, and SPDK3888 with sgRNA targets from Sub-
heading 3.3 step 1 onto a fresh LB plate with KSRC antibio-
tics. Incubate overnight at 28 °C. 
2. Inoculate 6 mL LB liquid media with KSRC antibiotics and 
incubate in a shaker at 28 °C for 14–16 h (see Note 9). 
3. Collect Agrobacterium cells by centrifugation at 3500×g for 
20 min. Resuspend the pellet in agroinﬁltration media to 
OD600 = 1.0. 
4. Incubate the Agrobacterium cultures on a ﬂat shaker at 
50–60 rpm for a minimum of 3 h at room temperature (see 
Note 10). 
5. Mix pTRV1 with TRV2 derivatives (SPDK3860 or SPDK3888 
or SPDK3888 + sgRNA target) in a 1:1 ratio. 
6. Using a 25-G needle, prick the abaxial side of the three leaves 
to be inﬁltrated on each plant. Use plants 2 weeks old after 
transplanting for inﬁltration (see Notes 11 and 12). 
7. Use a 1-mL needleless syringe to inﬁltrate mixed Agrobacter-
ium solution from step 5 into three leaves with a needle prick 
from step 6 (Fig. 3a). Repeat inﬁltration until the entire leaf is

inﬁltrated with the Agrobacterium solution. Inﬁltrate three 
plants per sgRNA target (see Note 13). 
8. Keep the inﬁltrated plants in the lab overnight. Transfer plants 
to the growth chamber set at 24 °C with a 14-h light and 10-h 
dark condition with a light intensity of 100 μE m-2 s-1 or light 
cart with a day/night cycle timer at room temperature. 
3.4.2 
Assessment of 
Somatic Editing in the TRV 
Inﬁltrated and Systemic 
Leaves of N. benthamiana:: 
SpCas9 Plants 
1. Five days post-agrobacterium inﬁltration with TRV vectors, 
take a 0.5-mm-diameter leaf sample from the inﬁltrated leaves 
and use Phire Plant Direct PCR Kit to PCR the DNA fragment 
ﬂanking the sgRNA target site. Aim for 200–400 bp fragments 
(Fig. 3a) (see Note 14). 
2. Purify the PCR fragment using a Zymo PCR Puriﬁcation Kit 
and sequence it with Sanger sequencing, using the forward and 
reverse primers used for amplifying the PCR fragment. Typical 
trace ﬁles from Sanger sequencing showing editing in NbPDS is 
shown in Fig. 3a. 
3. Analyze the Sanger sequence data using ICE analysis (https:// 
ice.synthego.com/#/) (REF) to determine the efﬁciency of 
editing in the inﬁltrated leaves (see Note 15). 
4. About 2–3 weeks post-inﬁltration of TRV vectors, assess the 
somatic editing in the systemic leaves by following steps 1–3 
described in Subheading 3.4.2 (see Note 16). 
3.4.3 
Assessment of 
Heritable Editing in Progeny 
from Seeds Collected from 
TRV-Inﬁltrated N. 
benthamiana::SpCas9 
Plants 
1. Collect seeds from the top 1/3rd of TRV-inﬁltrated plants that 
show high somatic editing efﬁciency, as described in [18]. 
2. Sow individual seeds into moistened soil in a 2.5″ × 2.5″ pot, 
place it in an 11″ W × 22″ L × 2.5″ D planting tray, and cover 
the tray with a transparent humidity dome. Set up 32 pots that 
ﬁt into a single tray. Keep the tray in a growth chamber with a 
photoperiod of 14 h light/10 h dark (100 μmol/m2 /s) at 24 ° 
C and 40–60% humidity (see Note 17). 
3. Ten to fourteen days post-sowing the seed, assess the editing in 
individual progeny plants by following steps 1–3 described in 
Subheading 3.4.2 (see Note 18). 
4. To determine the type of mutation and percentage of mutation 
type in each progeny plant, sequence the PCR product ﬂanking 
the target site using Amplicon-EZ next-generation sequencing 
(NGS) from Azenta Life Sciences (Formerly Genewiz) or from 
another similar amplicon NGS sequencing servicing company.

3.4.4 
Analysis of NGS 
Sequencing and 
Determination of Editing 
Efﬁciency and Type of 
Editing 
1. For demultiplexing, we use fastq-multx (https://github.com/ 
brwnj/fastq-multx). 
2. Create separate .txt ﬁles that correspond to your forward and 
reverse barcodes, respectively. They should contain three col-
umns: Id, Sequence, and group (Fig. 3b). 
(a) 
Id = Unique sample identiﬁer. 
(b) 
Sequence = Sequence that is unique to the sample, e.g., 
barcode. 
(c) 
Group = Leave as 1. 
3. Use the command fastq-multx -l fwd_barcode.txt Forward-
Reads.fq ReverseReads.fq -o %R1%R2. 
4. Each Id in the barcode ﬁle will be given two separate ﬁles, R1 
and R2, containing all reads which contain the barcode 
sequence. 
5. Use the command fastq-multx -l rev_barcode.txt Sample1_R1. 
fq Sample1_R2.fq -o %R1%R2 (see Note 19). 
6. Upload both the R1 and R2 ﬁles for each sample to (http:// 
www.rgenome.net/cas-analyzer/#!). 
7. Add your reference sequence to the template (i.e., the 
sequenced amplicon). 
8. Add the target sequence (i.e., gRNA target). 
9. Adjust the comparison range to an appropriate length; for our 
analyses, we use a 40 bp comparison range (see Note 20). 
10. Submit the program and record the editing efﬁciency and type 
of editing.

The steps involved in generating heritable editing in a target gene 
of interest using A. thaliana::SpCas9 plants and the TRV system are 
summarized in Fig. 4. 
3.5.1

pTRV1, 
SPDK3959, SPDK3888, and SPDK3888+sgRNA target gen-
erated in Subheading 3.2 onto a fresh LB plate with KRG 
antibiotics. Incubate overnight at 28 °C. 
2. Inoculate Agrobacterium GV3101 containing various con-
structs into 5 mL LB liquid media with KRG antibiotics and 
incubate in a shaker at 28 °C for 14–16 h. For each TRV2 
derivative, inoculate 5 mL pTRV1. 
3. Collect Agrobacterium cells by centrifugation at 3500×g for 
20 min. Resuspend the pellet in 5 mL sterile water by pipetting 
up and down (no vortexing).

heritable editing in a target gene of interest are depicted. In the target region schematic, green and red 
represent target guide sequence (N20) and PAM (NGG), respectively; FP forward primer, RP, reverse primer. A 
Sanger sequence trace ﬁle example includes samples from negative control SPDK3888 with no editing (top) 
and positive control SPDK3959 with editing in AtPDS3 (bottom); sequences below the green and red line 
represent target and PAM sequences 
4. Centrifuge at 3500×g for 10 min. Resuspend the pellet in 
agroinﬁltration media to OD600 = 1.5. Prepare 5 mL culture 
for each construct. 
5. Incubate the cultures on a ﬂat shaker at 50–60 rpm for 3 h at 
room temperature. 
6. Mix pTRV1 with TRV2 derivatives (SPDK3959 or SPDK3888 
or SPDK3888 + sgRNA target) in a 1:1 ratio. 
7. Use a 1-mL pipette to dispense the mixed TRV culture onto an 
MS plate containing 10-day-old Arabidopsis::SpCas9 seedlings 
(see Subheading 3.1.2) (Fig. 4). Add enough culture so that all 
the seedlings are completely submerged in the TRV culture. 
8. Seal the plates with micropore tape and incubate them in a 
growth chamber set at 24 °C with a 12-h light/12-h dark 
condition with a light intensity of 100 μE  m-2 s-1 for 4 days.

9. Transplant at least 20–30 seedlings from the plate onto 
2.5″ × 2.5″ pots containing moistened soil and keep the pots 
in 11″ W × 22″ L × 2.5″ D trays. Cover the tray with a 
transparent humidity dome. Keep the tray in a growth chamber 
with a photoperiod of 14 h light/10 h dark (100 μmol/m2 /s) 
at 24 °C and 40–60% humidity. Remove the humidity dome 
after 3–4 days (see Note 21). 
3.5.2 
Assessment of 
Somatic Editing in the TRV-
Flooded Arabidopsis:: 
SpCas9 Plants 
Two weeks post-transplanting of TRV Agro-ﬂooded plants, assess 
somatic editing by following steps 1–3 described in Subheading 
3.4.2. Typical trace ﬁles from Sanger sequencing showing editing in 
AtPDS3 are shown in Fig. 4 (see Note 22). 
3.5.3 
Assessment of 
Heritable Editing in Progeny 
from Seeds Collected from 
TRV-Flooded Arabidopsis:: 
SpCas9 Plants 
1. Collect seeds in three batches—early, middle, and late-stage 
developed seeds as described in [19]. 
2. Soak 40–50 seeds from the middle batch in 1.5-mL Eppendorf 
tube containing 1 mL water. Keep it in the cold room or 
refrigerator for 3 days. 
3. Place individual seeds in 2.5″ × 2.5″ pot with moistened soil 
and place the pots in an 11″ W × 22″ L × 2.5″ D tray, and cover 
the tray with a transparent humidity dome. Set up 32 pots that 
ﬁt into a single tray. Keep the tray in a growth chamber with a 
photoperiod of 14 h light/10 h dark (100 μmol/m2 /s) at 24 ° 
C and 40–60% humidity. Take out the humidity dome once the 
seeds germinate and reach 2–3 leaf stage. 
4. About 2–3 weeks post-sowing, assess the editing in individual 
progeny plants by following steps 1–3 in Subheading 3.4.2, 
step 4 in Subheading 3.4.3, and steps 1–10 in Subheading 
3.4.4. 
4 
Notes 
1. Use ethanol-resistant marker to label the tubes. Mixing can be 
performed using any rotating shaker. 
2. A 200- or 1000-μL pipet could also be used to remove the 
liquid. 
3. Longer incubation will bleach the seeds. 
4. Cold treatment, also called stratiﬁcation, will help to break 
dormancy and synchronize germination. 
5. It is better to design 3–4 guides and test the efﬁciency of 
editing in the inﬁltrated leaves. If possible, target the beginning 
of the coding region of the gene for editing. Follow up only 
with those guides that show the high efﬁciency of somatic 
editing in the inﬁltrated leaves.

286
Ugrappa Nagalakshmi et al.
6. To target two or three genes, generate sgRNA targets for each 
gene with a 23-bp spacer in between the targets. See the design 
example as described in [19]. 
7. Other cloning methods, such as in-fusion or Golden Gate, can 
also be used to clone, guide, and scaffold into SPDK3888. 
8. A. 
tumefaciens 
strain 
GV3101 
can 
also 
be 
used 
for 
N. benthamiana. However, we sometimes see necrosis of inﬁl-
trated leaves with GV3101. 
9. For each TRV2 derivative construct to be inﬁltrated, inoculate 
6 mL of pTRV1. 
10. A minimum of 3-h incubation is required for optimal induction 
of vir genes. 
11. A 200-ul pipette tip or razor blade could also be used to make a 
small prick or slit. 
12. Younger plants are better at obtaining better infection and 
editing efﬁciency. Infectivity is lower when older plants 
are used. 
13. To prevent cross-contamination, for each sgRNA target in 
TRV use a new needless syringe and fresh pair of gloves. 
14. CTAB or any other alternative methods could be used to get 
the template DNA for PCR. 
15. Use Sequences from plants inﬁltrated with negative control 
SPDK3888 to assess the editing efﬁciency. The efﬁciency of 
editing varies between 60% to 95%. It is better to follow up 
with plants that show more than 75% editing efﬁciency. 
16. Two weeks after inﬁltration of pTRV1 plus SPDK3860, photo-
bleaching due to editing of NbPDS will be visible in the sys-
temic leaves. 
17. When screening for PDS phenotype, cover the top of the pot 
with dark soil before sowing the seeds so that the white seed-
lings phenotype will be visible better. 
18. If the editing efﬁciency is more than 90%, it generally means 
the plant contains biallelic homozygous mutation in the target 
gene of interest. 
19. Completing this second demultiplexing step is not required for 
the analysis. However, it does ensure that all analyzed reads 
contain the proper barcode on both ends of the sequence. 
20. The comparison range can be set to any value; however, a 
smaller comparison range will minimize the quantiﬁcation of 
low-abundance SNPs not caused by Cas9-mediated editing. It 
is likely that these erroneous SNPs are caused by PCR or 
sequencing errors.

Heritable Gene Editing in Plants Using Viruses
287
21. Editing 
efﬁciency 
in 
Arabidopsis 
is 
lower 
than 
in 
N. benthamiana. Therefore, at least 25–30 seedlings after 
treatment with TRV should be genotyped to ﬁnd some plants 
that will have high somatic editing. 
22. After 2 weeks of ﬂooding Agrobacterium harboring pTRV1 
plus SPDK3959, photobleaching due to editing of AtPDS3 
will be visible in the leaves.

Immunoprecipitation Followed by Mass Spectrometry: 
An Approach for Identifying Host–Viral Protein–Protein 
Interactions 
Laura Medina-Puche and Rosa Lozano-Dura´n 
Abstract 
As obligate intracellular parasites, viruses rely on the efﬁcient manipulation of the cell they invade in order to 
multiply and spread. Protein–protein interactions between viral proteins (or their complexes) and cellular 
proteins are at the interface between virus and host and hence crucial for the outcome of the infection. 
Multiple techniques can be used to study protein–protein interactions in vivo in the context of the infected 
cell; among them, immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry (IP-MS) has proven an efﬁcient 
approach for the unbiased identiﬁcation of protein complexes containing a viral protein of interest. In this 
chapter, we discuss how to employ IP-MS to deﬁne the interactome of plant virus proteins by using 
transient expression in the experimental host Nicotiana benthamiana, using the geminivirus tomato yellow 
leaf curl virus (TYLCV) as an example. 
Key words Immunoprecipitation, Mass spectrometry, IP-MS, Protein complexes, Protein–protein

Introduction 
Since viruses are strict intracellular parasites, they have evolved 
strategies to efﬁciently manipulate the cells they infect, on which 
they fully rely. Such strategies commonly depend on the physical 
association between viral and cellular proteins and ultimately deter-
mine the outcome of the virus–host interaction. It clearly tran-
spires, therefore, that the study of protein–protein interactions is 
crucial for the understanding of the viral infection as well as the 
host anti-viral responses. These interactions, whenever possible, 
must be studied in the context of the infection, which changes 
the cellular environment, potentially enabling associations that are 
simply not possible in uninfected cells due, for example, to the 
absence of a partner or a given post-translational modiﬁcation.

In the absence of widely used, well-established plant cell lines 
amenable to easy transformation protocols to study viral infection, 
the plant virology ﬁeld has massively proﬁted from the use of the 
experimental species Nicotiana benthamiana, which allows Agro-
bacterium tumefaciens-mediated transient transformation of virtu-
ally all cells in a leaf patch, therefore enabling a concomitant viral 
infection and expression of a tagged protein of interest, if required, 
in a local, temporally controlled manner. 
Multiple techniques have been developed to detect protein– 
protein interactions, both in vivo, in vitro, and in surrogate systems. 
Immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry (IP-MS) 
approaches has recently experienced a surge in virology studies 
due to technological advances in mass spectrometry-based proteo-
mics and experimental pipelines for immunopuriﬁcation of protein 
complexes, as well as the intrinsic advantages that this technique 
offers [1]. Among these, the in vivo detection of the interactions, 
the possibility to infer the interactomes of viral proteins in isolation, 
in combination, or in the context of the infection, as well as the 
chance to detect post-translational modiﬁcations of the proteins of 
interest and both direct and indirect interactions, including higher-
order protein complexes, make it particularly suitable for unbiased 
screens for interacting partners in plant cells. 
A conventional IP-MS workﬂow starts with the expression of 
the viral protein of interest in N. benthamiana, be it from the 
infectious clone directly or from a binary vector if the protein 
needs to be fused to a tag to enable immunopuriﬁcation. Following 
the accumulation of the transgenically expressed protein, the cells 
are disrupted, total protein is isolated, and immunopuriﬁcation 
(with antibodies against the protein of interest or against the 
fused tag) ensues. The puriﬁed protein complexes are then digested 
and can be separated by liquid chromatography (LC) and analyzed 
by tandem MS (MS/MS) (Fig. 1). Bioinformatic analysis and data 
processing will provide a list of putative interactors, which must be 
experimentally conﬁrmed (Fig. 2). 
In this chapter, we describe the use of IP-MS to deﬁne the 
interactome of plant virus proteins by using transient expression in 
N. benthamiana, with the geminivirus tomato yellow leaf curl virus 
(TYLCV) as a model case; experimental details, as well as a simpli-
ﬁed overview of the general workﬂow (Figs. 1 and 2), are provided.

Cloning
If a speciﬁc antibody against the viral protein of interest is available, 
transient expression of the protein in N. benthamiana can be 
carried out directly from the infectious viral clone. If this is not 
the case, the viral gene of interest must be fused to a tag for 
immunopuriﬁcation 
and 
expressed 
from 
the 
viral 
clone 
(if possible) or from a binary vector.

plasmid from the liquid-cultured bacteria and conﬁrm the 
integrity and correctness of the cloned sequence by Sanger 
sequencing. 
8. Next, sub-clone the CDS fragment into a Gateway-compatible 
binary destination vector through a LR reaction (see Subhead-
ing 2.2 and Note 1). 
9. Next, proceed as indicated in steps 5–7. 
10. Transform the destination vector into A. tumefaciens compe-
tent cells, plate them in solid LB medium supplemented with 
the appropriate antibiotics, and allow them to grow in a 28 °C 
oven for 2 days. 
11. Then, proceed as described in step 6.

Agrobacterium-
Mediated Transient 
Gene Expression in N. 
benthamiana 
Transient expression assays are performed as described in [4] with 
minor modiﬁcations. As the viral infection reshapes the cell envi-
ronment where plant and viral proteins coexist, the host–virus 
protein–protein interaction network must be identiﬁed in the pres-
ence of the virus whenever possible. 
1. Three days before the experiment, streak out A. tumefaciens 
harboring 
the 
corresponding 
binary 
vectors 
from 
the

300

corresponding glycerol stocks or freshly transformed colonies 
on LB agar plates supplemented with appropriate antibiotics 
and incubate in a 28 °C oven for 2 days. 
2. Inoculate a liquid culture by picking a single colony with a 
sterile toothpick or pipette tip and dropping it in 5 mL LB 
liquid media supplemented with the appropriate antibiotics. 
Incubate overnight at 28 °C in a shaker (200 rpm). 
3. Centrifuge bacterial cultures at 4000g for 10 min. 
4. Resuspend the pellet in 5 mL of inﬁltration buffer (10 mM 
MgCl2, 10 mM MES pH 5.6, 150 μM acetosyringone) and 
measure the optical density (OD600) in a spectrophotometer. 
5. Adjust the bacterial concentration to a ﬁnal OD600 of 0.2–1 (see 
Note 9) with inﬁltration buffer and incubate at room tempera-
ture in the dark for 2–4 h  (see Note 10). 
6. Inﬁltrate the abaxial side of four-week-old N. benthamiana 
plant leaves with a 1-mL needleless syringe (see Note 11). For 
experiments 
that 
required 
co-inﬁltration, 
mix 
the 
A. tumefaciens suspensions carrying different constructs at 1: 
1 ratio before inﬁltration. 
7. Return the inﬁltrated N. benthamiana plants to the growth 
room to allow transfer and expression of the cassette containing 
the transgene(s) of interest. Samples will be collected between 
36 and 40 h post-inﬁltration.

Visualization of 
Protein Accumulation 
and Subcellular 
Localization 
(Conﬁrmation of 
Protein Accumulation 
by Fluorescence 
Microscopy) 
1. Imaging can start between 36 to 40 h post-inﬁltration (see 
Note 12). Cut small leaf disks from the plants expressing the 
protein of interest with a corkborer (4 mm diameter). 
2. Place the disks on a microscope slide, put a drop of water, and 
cover with a coverslip. 
3. For subcellular localization and/or conﬁrmation of protein 
accumulation, plant tissues expressing ﬂuorescent tag-fused 
proteins can be imaged with a ﬂuorescence microscope or a 
confocal 
laser 
scanning 
microscope 
(CLSM) 
using 
the 
corresponding preset settings. As a reference, in our lab, we 
use CLSM from Leica (Leica TCS SP8 confocal microscope 
provided with LAS-X 2.01 software) or Zeiss (Zeiss LSM 
880 upright confocal microscope provided with ZEN black 
edition software). 
4. For experiments that require co-expression of two (or more) 
ﬂuorescent tag-fused proteins, the preset sequential scan set-
tings are recommended.

Quick Protein 
Extraction and 
Western Blot 
(Conﬁrmation of 
Protein Accumulation 
by Western Blot) 
1. Protein extraction can start 36 to 40 h post-inﬁltration (see 
Note 12). Cut three to six leaf disks from the plants expressing 
the protein of interest with a corkborer (8 mm diameter). 
2. Grind the samples by your preferred method keeping them 
frozen during the entire procedure. 
3. Add 120 μL protein extraction buffer, mix well by vortex, and 
let thaw on ice for 10 min. 
4. Centrifuge at 4 °C for 10 min at 16,000g. 
5. Take 100 μL of the clear supernatant, add 30 μL of 4× Laemmli 
buffer, vortex, and boil for 10 min (see Note 13). 
6. Centrifuge at 4 °C for 1 min at 16,000g. Load the supernatant 
on a 10% 1.5 mm acrylamide gel (see Note 14) and run at 
120 V. 
7. Wash the acrylamide gel in 1× semi-dry transfer buffer supple-
mented with 20% methanol for 15 min. 
8. Proceed to protein transfer to a previously activated PVDF 
membrane via wet or semi-dry transfer methods. For reference, 
we use Bio-Rad Semi-Dry Transfer Cell and PVDF mem-
branes, but other similar systems can be used. 
9. Block the membrane in 5% milk-TBST for at least 1 h. Then, 
wash it with TBST, add the primary antibody in 5% milk-TBST, 
and incubate for 1–3 h at room temperature in gentle continu-
ous shaking (see Note 15). 
10. Remove the primary antibody, rinse, and wash the membrane 
3 times in TBST for 5 min each. Then, add the secondary 
antibody in 5% milk-TBST and incubate for 1 h at room 
temperature in gentle continuous shaking (see Note 15). 
11. Remove the secondary antibody, rinse, and wash the mem-
brane three times in TBST for 5 min each and one time in 
TBS for 5 min. 
12. ECL develop the membrane and visualize the result in a West-
ern blot imager. Alternatively, expose the ECL-developed 
membrane to an X-ray ﬁlm and visualize the results following 
ﬁlm processing. 
3.7 
Protein 
Extraction and 
Immunoprecipitation– 
Mass Spectrometry 
(IP-MS) Analysis 
1. Inﬁltrate 
fully 
expanded 
young 
leaves 
of 
4-week-old 
N. benthamiana plants with A. tumefaciens carrying constructs 
to express the corresponding viral protein of interest fused to 
an appropriate tag. To analyze plant host–viral protein–protein 
interactions in the context of the viral infection, co-inﬁltrate 
A. 
tumefaciens 
carrying 
the 
infectious 
clone 
of 
the 
corresponding virus in the respective experiments. 
2. Collect samples 36–40 h post-inﬁltration; accumulation of 
tag-fused proteins is conﬁrmed by confocal microscopy (see 
Subheading 3.5, Note 3) or by Western blot (see Subheading

302
Laura Medina-Puche and Rosa Lozano-Dura´ n
3.6, 
Note 
15). 
Collect 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
inﬁltrated 
N. benthamiana leaves, freeze them immediately in liquid 
nitrogen, and keep them at -80 °C until further use (see 
Notes 12 and 16). 
3. Perform protein extraction and IP-MS analysis as previously 
described in [4] and as detailed in the following steps. 
4. Grind the samples in liquid nitrogen using your preferred 
method, keeping them frozen during the entire procedure. 
5. Extract total proteins in protein extraction buffer (2 mL per 1 g 
of tissue). 
6. Clean the extracts by ﬁltration using Miracloth or chromatog-
raphy columns. 
7. Incubate the cleared extracts with immunoconjugate agarose 
beads for 1 h at 4 °C under continuous and gentle rotation. For 
GFP-fused proteins, we recommend using GFP-Trap beads 
(Chromotek, Germany) (see Note 4). 
8. Wash the beads using wash buffer with detergent (0–2% 
NP-40) 3 times and wash buffer without detergent twice. 
9. Run the immunoprecipitated proteins in an acrylamide gel. 
Stain the gel with Coomassie blue, excise bands covering each 
lane with a scalpel, and subject to mass spectrometry analysis. 
During this process, take extreme precautions to avoid con-
tamination with keratin from inappropriate sample handling 
(see Note 17). Alternatively, the beads loaded with the precipi-
tated proteins can be sent directly to MS analysis. 
3.8 
Bioinformatic 
Peptide Identiﬁcation 
Process 
Matching raw MS data to peptide sequences is performed using 
Mascot 
software 
with 
the 
annotated 
proteins 
from 
the 
N. benthamiana draft genome sequence v. 0.4.4, which can be 
obtained from the International Solanaceae Genomics Project 
(SOL) (https://solgenomics.net/). A decoy database can be con-
structed with those protein sequences originated from randomized 
and reversed raw N. benthamiana protein sequences. The decoy 
hits are used to estimate the false-positive rate in the peptide 
identiﬁcation process. Because frequently a large number of poten-
tial protein–protein interactions are identiﬁed from the IP-MS data, 
the MiST software (Mass spectrometry interaction STatistics) [5] 
can be used to restrict the putative protein–protein interactions to 
those which are high conﬁdence; since it has been demonstrated 
that viral proteins can convergently target host targets, we recom-
mend removing the speciﬁcity criterion. 
We recommend ﬁltering high-quality MS data based on four 
criteria: (1) protein threshold—larger than 99%; (2) minimum 
number of peptides—1; (3) peptide threshold—>95%; and 
(4) DECOY FDR—lower than 1%; (5) functional information 
available. Data were analyzed by Scaffold 4.9.

3.9 
Conﬁrmation of 
Protein–Protein 
Interactions 
Usually, a combination of techniques is necessary to conﬁrm and 
characterize protein–protein interactions identiﬁed by IP-MS. To 
conﬁrm intraviral or plant host–viral protein–protein interactions, 
proteins of interest must be co-expressed alone or in the presence of 
the virus. While methods to study protein–protein interactions are 
numerous, using at least two different approaches, at least one 
being in vivo, is recommended (see Note 18). 
4 
Notes 
1. Following the procedures described in [6]. We mostly use the 
Gateway cloning system; however, any other cloning method 
would be equally applicable. 
2. The Solanaceae species N. benthamiana is the most widely used 
experimental host in plant virology due at least in part to the 
large number of diverse plant viruses that can successfully infect 
it. Another aspect to consider is its amenability to genetic 
manipulation and to be a platform for Agrobacterium-
mediated transient assays such as virus-induced gene silencing 
(VIGS) or transient protein expression. For these reasons, its 
use as a plant model has expanded considerably in recent years, 
rapidly gaining in popularity, particularly in studies requiring 
protein localization or interaction, or plant-based systems for 
protein expression and puriﬁcation. 
3. If the emission spectra of ﬂuorescent proteins/dyes overlap, 
bleed-through will occur when imaging. We recommend using 
sequencing scanning to avoid this crosstalk. The Spectra-
Viewer (https://www.thermoﬁsher.com/order/spectra-
viewer) can be consulted for choosing the ﬂuorescent pro-
teins/dyes to use. Choosing a practical combination of ﬂuores-
cent proteins/dyes is crucial for the success of the experiment. 
4. Agarose beads for very low background and high binding 
capacity IP, or magnetic agarose beads for magnetic separation 
and high binding capacity IP. 
5. Western blot analysis can be an alternative to the imaging step 
when microscopy facilities are unavailable, ﬂuorescent tags are 
not used, or when working with untagged proteins. We 
strongly recommend conﬁrming the appropriate accumulation 
of the protein of interest by one of the two methods before 
proceeding to the immunoprecipitation step. 
6. During protein transfer, proteins previously separated in a gel 
by electrophoresis are transferred to a membrane sheet. There 
are a variety of methods where electroblotting (wet, semi-dry, 
and dry electroblotting) has emerged as the most used due to 
its higher speed and efﬁciency compared to other methods.

7. Standardized transient protein expression experiments require 
four-week-old N. benthamiana plants. Therefore, to timely 
perform this protocol, researchers must sow seeds 5 weeks in 
advance. To ensure a continuous supply of plants, we recom-
mend sowing new batches of seeds every week. Second, to 
successfully implement this protocol, researchers must grow 
healthy 
N. 
benthamiana 
plants. 
Since 
the 
growth 
of 
N. benthamiana plants and Agrobacterium-mediated T-DNA 
transformation requires optimal environmental conditions 
such as light, humidity, and temperature, we highly recom-
mend the use of environmentally controlled cultivation 
facilities. 
8. It is recommended to use pots of a size not smaller than 
7 × 7 cm and to supplement the watering solution with fertil-
izer once every 2 weeks. The use of plants older than 4 weeks is 
not recommended. 
9. We recommend optimizing in advance the optical density 
required for each case. Use the lowest concentration of Agro-
bacterium that does not compromise transformation efﬁciency 
whenever possible. 
10. Incubation is required to allow the phenolic compound acet-
osyringone to induce the expression of the Agrobacterium vir 
genes, required for the plant cell transformation through 
T-DNA transfer with higher efﬁciency. 
11. We suggest inﬁltrating two leaves per plant corresponding to 
the (already fully expanded) third and fourth youngest leaves. 
In order to reduce plant-to-plant variation, we recommend 
inﬁltrating at least six individual leaves from three different 
plants per sample for each biological replicate. After the inﬁl-
tration, gently dry the excess bacterial suspension with a paper 
towel. 
12. We 
recommend 
to 
experimentally 
optimize 
the 
post-
agroinﬁltration sample harvest time in order to ensure the 
highest protein accumulation. 
13. Optimize boiling time and temperature so as not to lead to 
precipitation of the protein of interest. 
14. The percentage of the acrylamide gel will vary depending on 
the molecular weight of the protein of interest. For more 
information, please visit the following websites: https://www.

15. Antibody concentration and incubation time have to be opti-
mized for each individual case. Overnight incubations should 
be done at 4 °C. For the detection of GFP-tagged proteins, we 
usually use the following primary and secondary antibodies at 
the indicated dilutions: mouse anti-green ﬂuorescent protein 
(GFP) (M0802-3a, Abiocode, Agoura Hills, CA, USA) (1: 
10,000), and goat polyclonal anti-mouse coupled to horserad-
ish peroxidase (A2554, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) (1: 
15,000) [6]. 
16. For low-abundance proteins, scale up the amount of tissue. 
17. A common problem in mass spectrometry analyses is keratin 
contamination from the skin, hair, dust, clothing, and latex 
gloves. If keratins are present in high concentrations, they can 
interfere with mass spectrometry analyses, causing a loss in 
signal and masking proteins/peptides of interest, reducing 
the total number of proteins/peptides identiﬁed. Please check 
common tips on how to avoid keratin contamination. 
18. To conﬁrm speciﬁc protein–protein interactions, we recom-
mend 
a 
number 
of 
techniques: 
co-immunoprecipitation 
(co-IP), 
bimolecular 
ﬂuorescence 
complementation 
assay 
(BiFC), split-luciferase assay (Split-luc) (see Chap. 17 in this 
volume), and yeast-two hybrid (Y2H) are among our most 
frequently used ones [6].

In Situ Protein Microarray for Identifying the Geminivirus– 
Arabidopsis Interactome

Abstract 
The protein–protein interactions (PPI) by protein array technology complement other PPI assay technol-
ogies such as AP-MS and Y2H. The in situ protein array technology (NAPPA) enables low-cost, rapid, and 
comprehensive protein detection. It allows standardized and simultaneous assay of a wide range of proteins 
with a broad range of expression in cells. This technology facilitates the detection of protein–protein 
interactions within species and between heterologous species such as host–microbe. Here, we described 
the technique that identiﬁed a syntaxin-6 protein-mediated begomovirus infection using an array contain-
ing 4600 Arabidopsis genes. The protein microarray assay also identiﬁed several other viral protein–host 
protein interactions.

Introduction 
Proteins are the central system for the function of all biological 
processes and are critical for understanding biological systems. One 
of the most pressing challenges in understanding biological systems 
is providing detailed functional assignments to many proteins 
whose functions remain unknown. Even though protein–protein 
interactions are of fundamental importance, their complexity 
makes the development of this ﬁeld slow [1]. 
Protein arrays are advantageous for assessing the diversity of 
interactions. For example, this technology can be used in antigen– 
antibody screening [2], protein–protein interactions [3], post-
translational modiﬁcation target identiﬁcation [4], and protein-
nucleic acid-binding identiﬁcation [5]. 
We previously constructed an in situ protein array (nucleic acid 
programmable protein array: NAPPA) that enables screening for 
normalized protein abundances and can effectively detect protein–

protein interactions, even in small numbers of proteins in the cell, 
such as transcription factors [6, 7]. Since this technique uses 
on-demand synthetic proteins from ORF clones, the cost is low, 
and more than several thousand proteins can be screened quickly 
with little effort. In Arabidopsis, ORF clones are well established, 
and NAPPA can be created immediately with HaloTag ORF clones 
(https://www.arabidopsis.org/abrc/halo_tagged_orf_clones.jsp).

NAPPA can identify molecular interactions within the same 
species and analyze interactions between species, e.g., host–virus 
interactions [8]. Host–pathogenic virus interactions are important 
determinants of health and disease [9]. The NAPPA technology can 
identify host proteins that interact with viral proteins involved in 
infection, which will signiﬁcantly help scientists understand how 
the virus suppresses the plant antiviral mechanism. 
This chapter reports the procedure to detect plant–virus inter-
actions during Arabidopsis infection by a begomovirus. We used the 
movement protein (MP) and the nuclear shuttle protein (NSP) 
ORF clones from cabbage leaf curl virus (CabLCV) as queries to 
screen against 4600 ORF-NAPPAs. Among the candidate targets, 
we found a plant-speciﬁc syntaxin-6 protein displaying a proviral 
function 
and 
conﬁrmed 
previously 
identiﬁed 
MP-NSP-Host 
PPI [8].

Methods 
3.1 
Development of 
In Situ Protein Arrays 
1. Prepare the Qiagen 96-deep well block plate with 1200 μL TB  
media in each well. Sterilize the 48-pin stamp in 95% ethanol 
and expose it to ﬂames at a Bunsen burner. After cooling, stamp 
the E. coli sample into a 96-deep well block plate. Incubate 
overnight at 37 °C in a shaker. Harvest the E. coli cells by 
centrifugation for 20 min at 275 g at RT. Discard the superna-
tant and dry the plate. 
2. Prepare plasmid DNA with QIAprep 96 Turbo Miniprep Kit. 
Resuspend pelleted E. coli cells in 300 μL P1 resuspend buffer. 
Vortex to dissolve the pellet and add 300 μL P2 lysate buffer 
and seal. Vortex gently and incubate at RT for 5 min. Add 
400 μL neutralization buffer N3 and vortex. 
3. Remove cell lysate with the Turbo Filter plate and bind the 
plasmid DNA to the QIAprep plate. After washing 2 times with 
1 mL washing buffer PE, dry the QIAprep plate, elute the 
DNA by adding 200 μL elution buffer PE, and incubate for 
10 min. Centrifuge 10 min at 2750×g at RT to yield the 
plasmid DNA. 
4. Combine 20–30 μg of plasmid DNA from one to three prepa-
ration plates in collection tubes from the kit. Add 10% total 
volume of sodium acetate to tubes (i.e., 45 μL sodium acetate 
in a total volume of 450 μL). Add 100% total volume of 
isopropanol to tubes to precipitate plasmid DNA (i.e., 
450 μL isopropanol in a total volume of 450 μL). Centrifuge 
at 2750×g at 4 °C for 1 h. Change plate direction and centri-
fuge at 2750×g at 4 °C for 1 h. Discard the isopropanol. Add 
500 μL of 75% ethanol and centrifuge at 2750×g at 4 °C for 
20 min. Decant the 75% ethanol and dry. Resuspend the DNA 
pellet in 20 μL RNase-free water. 
5. Spot the plasmid DNA with the master mix to an aminosilane-
coated glass slide using microarray spotter or similar device 
[10, 11]. Plasmid DNA should be combined with the master 
mix at a 1 to 1 volume mixing ratio.

1. Prepare query plasmid DNA from E. coli cells with QIAprep 
Spin Miniprep. Express the 3xHA tagged virus query proteins 
individually using the TNT T7 coupled wheat germ extract kit 
for 2 h at 30 °C (see Fig. 1). Expression mix for query protein 
(TNT kit) is below. 
50 μL wheat germ (-80 °C). 
4 μL TNT buffer. 
6 μL minus Met amino acid mix. 
6 μL minus Leu/Cys amino acid mix. 
2 μL RNase inhibitor. 
2 μL T7 polymerase. 
2 μL 3  × HA-query DNA (1 μg/μL). 
Diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC) water to ﬁnal volume of 
100 μL. 
Incubate at 30 °C for 2 h. Prepare immediately before use. 
2. Combine two tubes of query proteins, and then, add 1.5 mL 
milk-PBST for each query protein. Transfer the glass slides 
from Subheading 3.2, step 3 to new divider dishes and add 
1.5 mL of query proteins with milk-PBST. For the interaction 
reaction, rock for 2 h at 4 °C. Retrieve the slides, immerse in 
milk-PBST in new dishes, and wash 3 times with milk-PBST. 
Block in milk-PBST and rock overnight at 4 °C. 
3. Transfer the glass slides to fresh divider dishes and add 1.5 mL 
of 1:500 dilution primary antibody (anti-HA mouse monoclo-
nal antibody), rock for 1 h at RT (see Note 1). Transfer the glass 
slides to fresh dishes, block in milk-PBST again for 5 min, and 
repeat 3 times. Transfer the glass slides to fresh divider dishes 
and add 1.5 mL of 1:200 dilution of anti-mouse HRP-coupled 
secondary antibody and rock for 1 h at RT (see Note 2).

Fig. 1 Query protein expression. In vitro synthesized 3xHA-NSP (nuclear shuttle 
protein) and 3xHA-MP (virus movement protein) were separated by SDS–PAGE 
and then screened by Western blot analysis using an anti-HA antibody to validate 
the query protein expression. (Reproduced from Gouveia-Mageste et al. [8] with 
the permission of Oxford University Press, license number 5503290696299) 
Transfer the glass slides to fresh divider dishes, block with 
PBST for 2 min, and repeat at 5 min, 10 min, 15 min, and 15 
min. Rinse the glass slide three times in MilliQ water. 
4. Transfer the glass slides to fresh dishes and add 1.5 mL TSA 
mix to each glass slide (see Note 3). Rock at RT for 10 min. 
Transfer the glass slides to fresh dishes and rinse the glass slides 
with MilliQ water three times to keep the slides wet, followed 
by drying the glass slides using a ball valve hose. Scan using 
Tecan scanner and Array-Pro software (see Fig. 2). To extract 
the data for spot identiﬁcation, use an array-pro analyzer scan-
ner and Tecan image analysis software or similar. Determine the 
position and boundaries of each spot on the NAPPA array and 
measure the signal intensity.

Fig. 2 Protein interaction detection with high-density HaloTag-NAPPA arrays. (a) 
The array showing protein interactors of 3xHA-tagged MP probe. (b) The array 
showing protein interactors of NSP probe. Each protein array contains ~4600 
unique ORFs spotted in duplicate (9200 spots), and protein synthesis, capture, 
and interaction detection were conducted (see Subheading 3.2 and 3.3). 
Candidate interactors were detected using anti-HA antibodies and can be 
found as white spots in the arrays. The signal intensity from each candidate 
interactor is calculated by the image analysis software. (Reproduced from 
Gouveia-Mageste et al. [8] with the permission of Oxford University Press, 
license number 5503290696299) 
3. Substrate application: 1:500 dilution of Cy3-conjugated TSA 
substrate. For eight glass slides, add 24 μL TSA into 9 ml PBS 
plus 3 mL diluent provided in the kit (25% total volume of the 
diluent) in a 15-mL conical tube (for one glass slide: 3 μL 
TSA/1.5 mL buffer). Mix well.
