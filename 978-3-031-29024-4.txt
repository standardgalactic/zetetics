This book is dedicated to Masanori Ohya
with whom I cooperated on quantum-like
modeling in cognition and molecular biology
for 25 years. He passed away too early and
not all his ideas were realized. I shall always
remember his hospitality at Noda-city (near
Tokyo) and our daylong discussions.

Preface
This book is about quantum-like modeling and its applications. Such modeling is
built on the methodology and the mathematical apparatus of quantum theory and it is
directed to applications outside of physics, namely to biology, cognition, psychology,
decision-making, economics, ﬁnances, social and political sciences, and artiﬁcial
intelligence. It is of essential importance to signify that this approach can be explored
for macroscopic systems and the system’s size is not signiﬁcant. The quantum-like
frameworkisapplicableonallscales,thatistosayfromproteinsandgenestoanimals,
humans, and ecological and social systems. The crucial role is played by the character
of information processing by a system and matching with the laws of quantum
information theory. Systems are treated as information processors. Metaphorically
one may say that system’s “hardware”, its physical and biological structures, are not
so signiﬁcant, but the system’s “software” plays the central role. We can speak about
quantum bioinformatics [25] which should not be mixed with quantum biophysics
[16]. The latter studies the genuine quantum physical processes in biosystems, e.g.,
in cells.
It is important to point out the immense inﬂuence of mathematics in physics,
emphasized by many scientists, and in particular, by E. Wigner [464]. However,
mathematical tools commonly used in theoretical and mathematical biology, cogni-
tion, and psychology are not as efﬁcient as in theoretical and mathematical physics. In
his usual provocative manner, I. Gelfand, one of the famous Soviet mathematicians,
contrasted Wigner’s thesis by pointing to “ineffectiveness of mathematics in biol-
ogy”—this remark was mentioned by Arnold [17] with reference to Gelfand. From
my point of view, Gelfand’s statement has to be reformulated and one would speak
about ineffectiveness of mathematics that is commonly used in biology, cognition,
and psychology. I presume someone has the intention to model the microsystems
behavior, say electrons, atoms, photons, within the classical analysis of functions
deﬁned on phase space, A = A(q, p). In this case, one would confront difﬁcul-
ties and soon would notice either the impossibility of such description of quantum

phenomena or at least its ineffectiveness.1 Physicists explored a new branch of math-
ematics, the theory of operators in complex Hilbert space in order to describe the
quantum phenomena in an effective way. And in quantum physics, the noncom-
mutative operator calculus works very well. Similarly, one should search for novel
mathematics which is proper for biological and mental phenomena. This book adver-
tises the same mathematics that was employed in quantum physics, noncommutative
operator calculus in complex Hilbert space. Why is it so attractive for discussed
applications? Personally, I was mainly driven by specialties of Quantum Probability
(QP) calculus which matches mental phenomena very well [230, 231, 254]. This
point will be discussed later in very detail. But one can look even at the deeper
level. It is useful to extract the basic problems in mathematical modeling of mental
phenomena highlighted by the experts in the ﬁeld.
I can recommend two handbooks [29, 195], and especially article [273] in the ﬁrst
one and the preface of the second one. Article [273] can be considered as the seed of
this book. In it, I argue that living systems should be modeled within open quantum
systems theory (see also [268]). The preface [29] is started with a brilliant citation
from a story written by Edgar Allan Poe (1845) entitled “The Purloined Letter”. In
this story, a protagonist, Mr. C. Auguste Dupin discussed the limits of mathematics
applicability:
“Mathematical axioms are not axioms of general truth. What is true of relation—
of form and quantity—is often grossly false in regard to morals, for example. In this
latter science it is very usually untrue that the aggregated parts are equal to the
whole. [...] two motives, each of a given value, have not, necessarily, a value when
united, equal to the sum of their values apart.”
One can be surprised by Poe’s doubts about the applicability of mathematics (of
19s) century to moral phenomena (cf. with attempts of say Freud to proceed with
“classical mathematics”). He also expressed doubts about the validity of the value-
additivity law. This is a very deep statement, and in quantum mathematics, it is
formulated as “eigenvalues of the sum of operators C = A + B are not equal to the
sums of the eigenvalues of the summands”, i.e., generally
ci ̸= ai + bi.
In fact, the violation of the value-additivity law is the key point of von Neumann’s
no-go theorem [451]; the ﬁrst statement on the impossibility of classical reduction
of quantum theory. Then, the authors of [29] also pointed out the noncommutativity
effect in conjunctions,
A&B ̸= B&A.
This order effect is also naturally formalized in the quantum framework. In fact,
these two effects, the value-nonadditivity and the order ones, are closely connected.
In probabilistic terms, they jointly expressed the violation of the formula of total
probability and interference of probabilities (Sects. 1.3 and 1.4).
1 I stress effectiveness of the quantum description and do not highlight various no-go statements
concerning the impossibility of the classical description (cf. [88, 89]).

Preface
ix
The essential part of the book is devoted to the order effect. This is a good place
to mention that its QP-realization in decision-making has been done in the article
[452].
We remark that in [29] the discussion is not coupled to quantum-like modeling: the
authors searched for novel mathematical tools for psychology, but their considera-
tions really cry for the appeal to quantum formalism. The main message [29] was that
avarietyofmathematicalmethodscouldbeexploredtosolvetheproblemsmentioned
by Edgar Allan Poe which I completely agree with. Quantum formalism should not
be treated as pretending to be the unique mathematical tool for modeling mental
phenomena. A while ago, in response to the developments of using the quantum
formalism outside of quantum mechanics, the eminent quantum physicist (the Nobel
Prize 2023) Anton Zeilinger told me, “Why should it be precisely the quantum
mechanics’ formalism? Maybe its generalization would be more adequate…” And
he is right, for the moment, despite its tremendous success, quantum-like modeling is
still at the testing stage. May be one day new, more advanced mathematical formalism
will be suggested for modeling in cognition, psychology, and decision-making.
However, from my viewpoint, quantum formalism is the most successful due to
its simplicity. The reader may be surprised: “Simplicity? But the quantum theory
is mysterious and very complicated!” One would immediately recall the famous
statement commonly assigned to Richard Feynman “I think I can safely say that
nobody understands quantum mechanics.” But here “understanding” is related to
the interpretation problem of quantum mechanics; its formalism is very simple; it
is linear algebra. And in quantum information theory, which is the most useful for
applications, including quantum engineering, linear state spaces are ﬁnite dimen-
sional. So, this is the matrix calculus in H = Cn . Linear evolution is very rapid and
this is the advantage of the quantum-like like representation of mental states and the
corresponding linear processing of them.
Although I put so much effort into justiﬁcation of quantum-like modeling through
QP analysis and especially its contextual nature, slowly I started to understand that
the seed of cognition quantumness (not only of humans, but also other biosystems),
is in the logic structure of information processing. Quantum logic corresponds to the
linear representation of information. The basic law distinguishing classical (Boolean)
and quantum logic is the distributivity law, it is violated in quantum logic (see article
[371] for the details). In this book, the logical aspects of quantum-like information
processing are only brieﬂy mentioned.
After this motivational block (see also Sect. 1.1), we continue to discuss the book’s
content in more detail.
We emphasize that quantum-like modeling of cognition should be sharply distin-
guished from the quantum brain studies (see, e.g., [66, 67, 182, 208, 376, 443, 447,
448]) attempting to reduce information processing by cognitive systems including
“generation of consciousness” to the quantum physical effects in the brain. However,
we do not criticize the quantum brain project, although its difﬁculties are well known:
e.g., the brain is too hot and big, and the scales of neurons operating are too rough
to be compared with the quantum physical scales.

Preface
In quantum-like modeling, it is simply not important whether the genuine quantum
physical processes in the brain’s cells contribute to cognition or not. Generally,
quantum-like modeling is performed on the meta-level of cognition; it does not
concern the biophysical processes in neurons (however, cf. Chap. 6). In this frame-
work, a biosystem, in particular, the brain is treated as a black box in which infor-
mation processing cannot be described by the Classical Probability [318] (CP), and
hence, the classical information theory. Non-classical probability and information
theories are in demand. In particular, in decision-making, exploring CP leads to
various paradoxes which are typically coupled to the irrational behavior of humans.
My suggestion [230] was to employ Quantum Probability (QP) and quantum infor-
mation theories, instead of the classical ones. Why should especially quantum theory
be involved? This is a complex problem.
There exist plenty of other models different from CP and QP. For example, the use
of QP in decision-making was not derived from some basic principles for cognition
and psychology. Commonly, QP is used pragmatically—to resolve paradoxes and to
have a general probabilistic framework applicable to decision-making, in all areas
of humanities and economics, as well as in biology. There is no priory reason to
hope that QP would cover all problems which arise in decision-making. One might
ﬁnd paradoxes even in QP-based decision theory. May be other probabilistic models
different both from CP and QP should be employed.
Surprisingly, physicists have the same problem. In contrast to relativity theory,
QM was not derived from natural physical principles (see Zeilinger [438] for the
discussion on this problem). There is no reason to expect that all experiments in
micro-world would match QP constraints.
In physics, one typically debates CP versus QP, and classical versus quantum
physics. However, one can even test whether physics of microsystems can violate
the QP laws, i.e., whether electrons and photons can behave exotically even from
the QP viewpoint. The corresponding test is given by the Sorkin equality [417] for
the three slit experiment (see Chap. 15). This is really surprising that two- and three-
slit experiments have so different probabilistic structures. The three-slit experiment
was done by the Weihs group (Austria). They did not ﬁnd deviations from QP, the
Sorkin inequality was not violated [413, 414]. Similar experiments can be done for
decision-making by humans (Chap. 15).
So, my recommendation to the reader: “Apply the quantum-like models, but be
cautious!”
The essence of this book is the application of the special part of quantum theory—
the open quantum systems theory. Any live biosystem is an open system. To analyze
its behavior, it is natural to apply this theory [273] as the most general (known for
the moment) theory describing the interaction of a system S and the surrounding
environment E. As was already emphasized, biosystems are considered as informa-
tion processors, and open quantum systems theory is treated as a part of the quantum
information theory. The interaction between S and E is not classical force-like, but
based on the information exchange. Generally, the open quantum systems theory is
used as a theory of open information systems.

Preface
xi
In particular, the treatment of biosystems as open information systems can
explain order stability in them, i.e., to present the quantum-like formalization of
Schrödinger’s speculations in his famous book “What is life?" [406]. Quantum
entropy (say von Neumann or linear entropy) is employed as a quantitative measure
of order. Its dynamics in the process of information exchange between S and E
crucially differs for the dynamics of classical entropy (Chaps. 4 and 5). In this book,
the basic quantum master equation is the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad
(GKSL) equation. This equation describes Markovian evolution. The latter posseses
a strong constraint on the class of the mental state dynamics.
By portraying cognition in the open quantum system framework, we suggest
a quantum-like model of the brain’s functioning (Chap. 6). Now the brain is not
treated as simply a black box. The starting point is consideration of the electrochem-
ical states of neurons encoded in action potentials. Such states generate the brain’s
mental states which are mathematically formalized as quantum states processed
with the open quantum systems dynamics. This approach leads to the theory known
as quantum dynamical decision-making or decoherence decision-making [18, 28].
Mathematically the decoherence process is modeled with the GKSL-equation [18]
or more generally with the state-differentiation dynamics which was suggested in
articles [26, 28]. We remark that in such a framework, the mental state collapse can
be excluded from consideration.
Decoherence is a deep foundational notion. Heuristically, it can be interpreted as
the loss of quantumness, transition from QP to CP, and washing out of interference
of probabilities (see also [442]). It is quantiﬁed with linear entropy, the measure of
state’s purity. In quantum information theory, typically, decoherence is considered as
a negative factor disturbing information processing. In quantum dynamical decision-
making, decoherence plays the constructive role as decisions’ generator.
The open quantum systems theory is also used for the mathematical formaliza-
tion of the consciousness–unconsciousness interaction, the information exchange
between them (Chap. 7). Consciousness plays the role of a measurement device, it
performs observations over the states of unconsciousness. These observations can be
interpreted as the brain’s self-observations. So, human’s thoughts and decisions are
generated in the complex process of interaction between unconscious and conscious
states. From the viewpoint of quantum foundations, we use Bohr’s interpretation
of the outcomes of quantum measurements as generated in the complex process of
interaction between a system and measurement apparatus (Sect. 17.3). In particular,
these outcomes are not objective properties of a system that could be associated with
it before measurement. In the same way, the mind is not objective. Bohr’s ideology
structured within open quantum systems theory matches the Higher Order Theory of
Consciousness [326, 328]. In this framework, we model the emotional coloring of
conscious experiences. Such coloring is framed as contextualization. So, the theory
of emotions is coupled to such a hot topic of quantum foundations as contextuality
and the Bell inequalities.
One of the specialties of this book is exploring of quantum instruments in appli-
cations to psychology and decision-making. Quantum instruments are the basic tools
of the modern theory of quantum measurements. They describe the quantum state

xii
Preface
transformations generated by measurements’ feedback. Such transformations are not
reduced to ones based on the projections. More general state space transformations
are also needed. They cause a representation of quantum observable by Positive
Operator Valued Measures (POVMs), generalized observables. Typically, the latter
is considered as the basic entities of the modern theory of quantum measurements,
especially in quantum information theory. However, POVMs are just byproducts of
quantum instruments. POVM does not determine uniquely a state transformation
coupled to measurement’s feedback on the system’s state.
In physics, quantum instruments, and in particular, POVMs associated with them
were introduced at the advanced stage of quantum theory’s development. However,
modeling of cognition and decision-making should be based on quantum instru-
ments even for the basic psychological effects; for example, the combination of
the question order and response replicability effects [369, 370]. The von Neumann
measurement theory has a restricted domain of applications (see Chap. 14 on the
impossibility statement). The quantum instrument formalism is derived from open
quantum systems theory through the indirect measurement scheme employing the
unitary operator realization of the interaction between a system and a measurement
apparatus.
We hope that this book would serve as an introduction to quantum instrument
theory for scientists working in mathematical modeling in cognition, psychology,
and decision-making. Generally, we advertise exploring open quantum systems
in modeling behavior of biosystems, from genes, proteins, and cells, to animals,
humans, and ecological and social systems, from simple interference effects as
lactose–glucose metabolism in cells to cognition, unconscious–conscious interac-
tion, and collective social behavior.
Globally, the book content is divided into six parts devoted to different areas of
quantum-like modeling. Part I is introductory and it motivates the use of quantum
theory. Part II is on applications of open quantum systems theory to general biological
phenomena with an emphasis on the problem of stability in biosystems, here the
main mathematical tool is the quantum master equation generating decoherence;
the latter is treated positively as the source of state’s stabilization. Part III is an
introduction to the quantum instruments theory with applications to psychology and
decision-making. In Part IV, we move to the social systems and modeling of their
behavior with open quantum systems and ﬁeld theory, social laser and social Fröhlich
condensation. Part V contains a discussion on the possible generalizations of the
quantum-like modeling, by employing more exotic theories; in particular, it contains
a no-go theorem for proceeding solely with von Neumann measurements. Detailed
presentation of the mathematical formalism and quantum foundations is postponed
to Part VI (the last part of the book), with an emphasis on the role of incompatibility
and contextuality and the differences in the views of Bohr and Bell; the appendix
contains mathematical technicalities related to some statements in the book.

Part I
Quantum-Like Modeling
The central objective of this part is to illuminate the major directions of quantum-like
modeling, especially in cognitive psychology, decision-making, and social science
(see Part II for general quantum-like modeling for biosystems). First, we introduce
the motivation for operating with quantum probability outside of physics. Then we
recount the basics of classical and quantum probability (CP and QP) theories and
set forth the principles of quantum-like modeling of decision-making. In particular,
consideration of a special quantum-like model, “decision-making via decoherence”,
leads to coupling with the theory of open quantum systems. The Savage Sure Thing
principle is the starting point of the discussion on CP vs. QP-based notions of ratio-
nality. The violation of the total probability formula is widely used in the description
of the classical rationality violation. The classical total probability formula is modi-
ﬁed by adding the interference term, the magnitude of which can be treated as the
degree of deviation from classical rationality. The problem of rationality is coupled
with the disjunction and question order effects. Attempts to combine the latter with
another psychological effect, the response replicability effect, conduct us to inquire
about the possibility to proceed using the standard quantum measurement theory
(with the representation of observables by Hermitian operators and the quantum
state update via the projection postulate). We demonstrate that this psychological
effects combination can be modeled with quantum instruments. The social laser
theory brieﬂy mentioned in this part contains a comprehensive description of the
classical rationality violation by humans overloaded with information. This theory
describes, in particular, Stimulated Ampliﬁcation of Social Actions (SASA), e.g., in
the form of color revolutions and other social tsunamis.
This part is written schematically with the minimal introduction into the quantum
methodology and mathematical apparatus. The detailed presentation of quantum
axiomatics and the mathematical structure of quantum mechanics is postponed to
Part VI. We expect that the majority of the readers have some quantum experience;
Sect. 2.1 serves as a short recollection. Readers who have no idea about the quantum
theory may try to proceed by just reading Sect. 2.1. If it would not work, they can
jump to Part VI and follow Chap. 16; Chap. 17 is devoted to the deep foundational
problems, contextuality, complementarity, and Bell inequalities.

Chapter 1
Interplay Between Classical
and Quantum Probability
1.1
Quantum-Like Models: Motivation
In quantum-like modeling, a biosystem is a black box which information processing
can’t be described by the classical probability [318] (CP) and, hence, the classical
information theory. Biosystem’s size is not critical. The key point is that information
processing in such a system follows the laws of quantum probability [271] (QP) and
information.
How and why do biosystems use the quantum-like representation of information?
This question is rather perplexing and the answers are presented in the following
chapters (see, especially Chap. 6).
It is important to denote that it can be found plenty of probabilistic data which
doesn’t match CP, for example, in biology on all scales, from molecular biology
to ecology, cognitive psychology, and decision-making. In decision-making, such
data is typically coupled to probability fallacies and irrational behavior of agents
(see Chap. 19 for paradoxes). The existence of this data is the primary reason for
appealing to QP instead of CP [87, 386, 387]. The situation is similar to quantum
physics derived not from natural physical principles, as say special relativity, but
created “by hands” to describe the statistics of outputs of experiments in atomic
physics, cf. Zeilinger [438].
One may say that the appeal to QP and, consequently, to quantum information
theory to model, e.g., humans’ behavior and decision-making is too exotic. The
following natural question arises:
Why do we apply QP to humans, or, generally, biosystems?
Now we discuss the motivation for quantum-like modeling of decision-making
in more detail. We recall that as early as the 1970s, Tversky, one of the most cited
psychologists of all time, and Kahneman, who took the Nobel prize in economics in
2002, for prospect theory, which he co-developed with Tversky, have been demon-
strating cases where classical probability prescription and human behavior persis-

tently diverge [221–225]. Kahneman points out that, today, we are at the theoretical
cross-roads, with huge divisions across conﬂicting, entrenched theoretical positions:
Should we continue relying on CP as the basis for descriptive and normative pre-
dictions in decision-making (and perhaps ascribe inconsistencies to methodological
idiosyncrasies)?
Should we abandon probability theory completely and instead pursue explana-
tions based on heuristics, as Tversky and Kahneman proposed?
However, the use of probabilistic and statistical methods is really the cornerstone
of the modern scientiﬁc methodology, both in natural and social sciences. Thus,
although the heuristic approach to decision-making can’t be discarded completely,
it seems more natural not to reject the probabilistic approach to decision-making,
but to search for novel probabilistic models. And QP [26] is a good candidate for an
alternative to CP. We continue the discussion on basics of quantum-like modeling
in Chap. 4 by concentrating on its quantum information aspects and coupling with
theory of open quantum systems.
Generally, the quantum-like modeling project is very successful. It is shown that
such models can be applied to modeling the behavior of biosystems on all spatial
scales. Genes, proteins, cells, animals, humans, and social systems can be treated as
information processors and decision makers within the same mathematical model
[25]. From the information perspective, we can speak about the creation of a new
theory—quantum bioinformatics—which is a part of quantum information theory,
but not of quantum biophysics. One of the advantages of this theory is its generality,
its framework covers all possible biological systems.
Another advantage of the quantum-like representation is its linearity. The quan-
tum state space is a complex Hilbert space and dynamical equations are linear differ-
ential equations. The classical biophysical dynamics beyond quantum information
representation are typically nonlinear and very complicated. The use of linear space
representation simpliﬁes the processing structure. The quantum information rep-
resentation means that generally large clusters of classical biophysical states are
encoded by a few quantum states: the quantum structure arises as the result of coarse
graining (Chap. 6). It leads to essential information compressing. It also implies an
increase of stability in state processing (Chap. 4). This is a rather unusual viewpoint
on the use of the quantum information representation as lowering the complexity and
instability of information encoding and processing.
Since the essential part of this book is devoted to psychology and decision-making,
it is important to highlight the contribution of the quantum-like approach to math-
ematical modeling of psychological effects, e.g., the order effect, conjunction and
disjunction effects, and response replicability effect (see, e.g., [87, 89, 90, 190, 191,
254, 369, 370, 386–388, 452, 453]).

1.2 Brieﬂy About Classical and Quantum Probabilities

1.2
Brieﬂy About Classical and Quantum Probabilities
In this section, we do not concern the complex problem of the interpretation of
probability. We brieﬂy discuss this problem in Chap. 20.
CP was mathematically formalized by Kolmogorov [318] (1933). This is the cal-
culus of probability measures, nonnegative weight P(A) is assigned to any event A.
Events are represented by a family of sets forming a special set-theoretical structure
(Chap. 16). The main property of classical probability P is its additivity: if two events
A1, A2 are disjoint, i.e., in the set-representation, A1 ∩A2 = ∅, then the probability
of disjunction of these events equals the sum of probabilities
P(A1 ∪A2) = P(A1) + P(A2).
In the mathematical theory, the condition of additivity is extended to countable-
additivity, i.e., for a sequence of pairwise disjoint events A1, . . . , An, . . . ,
P(A1 ∪A2 ∪· · · ∪An ∪. . .) = P(A1) + P(A2) + · · · + P(An) + . . . .
However, as was emphasized by Kolmogorov [318], countable-additivity can’t be
checked experimentally, so this is the pure mathematical condition which is needed
for establishing the theory of Lebesque integration.
QP [26] is the calculus of complex probability amplitudes (wave functions) or in
the abstract formalism complex vectors—quantum states. Thus, instead of the oper-
ations with probability measures, one operates with vectors belonging to a complex
Hilbert space.
In the L2-space, each complex amplitude ψ = ψ(x), x ∈R3 is normalized by
one, i.e.,

R3 |ψ(x)|2dx = 1,
generates the probability by the Born rule:
Probability to ﬁnd a quantum system at the point x is given by
P(x|ψ) = |ψ(x)|2.
(1.1)
Then, for any (Borel) subset A of R3,
P(x ∈A|ψ) =

A
P(x|ψ)dx.
If we consider just one observable, then the possibility to represent its probability
distribution with the complex amplitude does not imply foundational consequences.
The essence of QP is that the same amplitude (quantum state) can be used to generate
the probability distributions for all possible quantum observables; some of them are
incompatible, i.e., they can’t be represented as random variables on the same prob-

ability space. A probability measure P which can be used for all these observables
does not exist, but a common complex amplitude ψ (quantum state) does exist.
What is its meaning? This is the most complicated foundational problem of QM,
the problem of the interpretation of a quantum state. This problem is discussed by
many authors, see also my books [231, 250, 251], and it is characterized by the
diversity of viewpoints. For example, I suggested the Växjö interpretation [251, 256]
(Chaps. 17 and 20). By this interpretation, a quantum state represents the complete
experimental context, in other words, the combination of the preparation and mea-
surement procedures. In cognitive applications, we can interpret ψ as a mental state
or a belief state—we will use both terms equivalently. Of course, one can interpret
a mental state. In Chap. 20, we discuss the problem of interpretations in connection
with decision theory.
1.3
Interference of Probabilities
By operating with complex probability amplitudes, instead of the direct operation
with probabilities, one can violate the basic laws of CP, in particular, additivity of
probability. One can get that, for disjoint events, the probability of disjunction is
strictly smaller or larger than the sum of probabilities
P(A1 ∪A2) < P(A1) + P(A2)
or
P(A1 ∪A2) > P(A1) + P(A2),
since QP calculus leads to the formula [231–233, 250, 251]
P(A1 ∪A2) = P(A1) + P(A2) + 2 cos θ

P(A1)P(A2).
(1.2)
The additional term is known as the interference term.
To derive this formula, we represent probabilities with the Born rule
P(Ai) = |ψi|2, i = 1, 2, P(A1 ∪A2) = |ψ1 + ψ2|2.
(1.3)
Then algebra of complex numbers implies that
|ψ1 + ψ2|2 = |ψ1|2 + |ψ2|2 + 2 cos θ|ψ1||ψ2|,
(1.4)
where θ is formed of arguments of complex numbers ψi = |ψi|eiθi as θ = θ1 −θ2.
Thus,interferenceofprobabilitieshasasimpleorigin:Born’srule+complexalgebra.
We recall that interference is the basic feature of waves, so often one speaks
about the probability waves. These are not usual waves in physical space, these are

ﬂuctuations of probability that can lead to its ampliﬁcation, namely, constructive
interference for cos θ > 0) or diminishing (destructive interference for cos θ < 0).
Surprisingly, physicist Richard Feynman (and not a mathematician) was the ﬁrst
who derived the formula for interference of probabilities (1.2) by analyzing the
probabilistic structure of the two slit experiment [149]. This is the good place to
present Feynman’s views on the role of probability in quantum physics [148] (italic
was added by me):
From about the beginning of the twentieth century experimental physics amassed an impres-
sive array of strange phenomena which demonstrated the inadequacy of classical physics.
The attempts to discover a theoretical structure for the new phenomena led at ﬁrst to a
confusion in which it appeared that light,and electrons, sometimes behaved like waves and
sometimes like particles. This apparent inconsistency was completely resolved in 1926 and
1927 in the theory called quantum mechanics. The new theory asserts that there are experi-
ments for which the exact outcome is fundamentally unpredictable, and that in these cases
one has to be satisﬁed with computing probabilities of various outcomes. But far more
fundamental was the discovery that in nature the laws of combining probabilities were not
those of the classical probability theory of Laplace.
I also worked a lot on the interference of probabilities (see monographs [251, 254]
for the complete account of my studies in this direction). Although both Feynman
and I couple the appearance of the interference term to the contextuality of quantum
theory,1 My approach differs from Feynman’s one. The right probabilistic meaning
to the interference of probabilities can be assigned not via the violation of additiv-
ity of probability (this was Feynman’s interpretation), but via perturbation of the
classical formula of total probability (Sect. 1.11). The latter assumes the conditional
interpretation of QP (see also Ballentine [42–44]).
1.4
Bayesian Versus Non-Bayesian Inference
We recall the Bayes formula for conditional probability in the CP-framework
P(B|A) = P(B ∩A)
P(A)
, P(A) > 0.
(1.5)
This deﬁnition of conditional probability implies that the probability of joint occur-
rence of events A and B can be expressed via the conditional probability as
P(A ∩B) = P(A)P(B|A),
(1.6)
or
1 In the example of the two slit experiment considered by Feynman [149], there are involved three
different contexts: C12 = both slits are open, C1 = only slit 1 is open, and C2 = only slit 2 is open
[251].

Interplay Between Classical and Quantum Probability
P(A ∩B) = P(B)P(A|B).
(1.7)
In CP, the LHSs of these two formulas give the same answer. However, in QP this is
not the case.
The formula of total probability (FTP) is a simple consequence of the Bayes for-
mula. Consider a pair a and b of discrete random variables CP-representing observ-
ables. Then
P(b = β) =

α
P(a = α)P(b = β|a = α).
(1.8)
Bayesian inference within CP is used to determine the posterior probability from
two given probabilities:
1. prior probability,
2. likelihood function.
By using Bayesian inference, one can ﬁnd the posterior probability with the aid
of the Bayes theorem (a trivial consequence of the Bayes formula for conditional
probability):
P(H | E) = P(E | H) · P(H)
P(E)
(1.9)
where H stands for a hypothesis whose validity is checked. Typically, decision maker
considers a few competing hypotheses (Hi), and the task is to determine which is the
most probable; P(H) is the prior probability, it gives the estimate of the hypothesis’
probability before the observational data E is obtained.
TheoutputofinferenceistheposteriorprobabilityP(H | E);thisistheprobability
after data E is observed.
P(E | H) is the probability of observing E under the assumption of that the
hypothesis H is true. This quantity is called the likelihood. As a function of E with
H ﬁxed, it indicates the compatibility of the evidence with the given hypothesis.
The quantity P(E) is known as model evidence for the realization of data E. This
factor is the same for all possible hypotheses being considered within this model. It
is determined by FTP
P(E) =

P(Hj)P(E|Hj),
where (Hj) is a complete set of hypothesis under consideration.
Hence
P(Hi | E) = P(E | Hi) · P(Hi)

j P(Hj)P(E|Hj)
(1.10)
To make a decision, one compares posterior probabilities (P(Hi | E)) and ﬁnds
the maximal of them.

1.5 Quantum-Like Paradigm: Contextual Information Processing
9
We remark that the Bayesian approach to conditional probability plays a cru-
cial role in CP modeling of cognition, machine learning, and artiﬁcial intelligence,
especially applications of Bayesian networks.
QP provides the possibility to relax some constraints on statistical data posed by
CP. One such constraint is classical FTP which is a consequence of additivity of CP
and the Bayes formula in the deﬁnition of conditional probability. More generally, QP
extends the calculus of conditional probabilities and the operation of the probability
update is generalized via the quantum operation of the state update. The latter is
based on the projection postulate (Chap. 16) or quantum instrument theory (Chap. 8).
Thus, the QP decision-making project can be considered as extension of boundaries
of Bayesian probability inference.
In particular, classical FTP (1.8) is modiﬁed; the quantum analog of FTP has the
additional term representing interference between the complex probability ampli-
tudes representing probabilities via the Born rule. For dichotomous observable a, it
has the form
P(b = β|ψ) = P(a = α1|ψ)P(b = β|a = α1, ψ) + P(a = α2|ψ)P(b = β|a = α2, ψ)+
(1.11)
2 cos θ

P(a = α1|ψ)P(b = β|a = α1, ψ)P(a = α2|ψ)P(b = β|a = α2, ψ).
This FTP modiﬁes the probability-interference formula (1.2) (see also Sect. 16.6);
the QP-conditional probabilities are deﬁned in Sect. 16.5. FTP with interference
term was derived in my works [231–233, 250, 251]. I was inspired by Feynman’s
analysis of the probabilistic structure of the two slit experiment [149] that led him
to the conclusion on non-additivity of QP and violation of the CP-additivity axiom.
Since quantum probabilities are conditional (or better to say contextual) probabilities,
it is more natural to express Feynman’s conclusion as the FTP violation.
QP inference is framed within the complex Hilbert space formalism via state
update generated by measurement feedback on a quantum state. In the simplest case,
this state update is mathematically described by the projection postulate and more
generally by quantum instruments (Chap. 8). By using quantum conditional probabil-
ities and FTP with the interference term, this quantum scheme can be mathematically
formed similarly to the Bayes theorem. In this book, we don’t describe this CP-like
representation of the probability update via state update (see articles [192, 193]).
1.5
Quantum-Like Paradigm: Contextual Information
Processing
The following paradigm can be used to motivate the applications of QP outside of
physics.

10
1
Interplay Between Classical and Quantum Probability
Quantum-like paradigm (Khrennikov 1999): The mathematical formalism of
quantum information and probability theories can be used to model behavior not
only of genuine quantum physical systems, but all context-sensitive systems, e.g.,
humans, ecological, social, political, and spiritual systems.
Contextual information processing can’t be based on the complete resolution of
ambiguity. It is meaningless to do this for the concrete context, if tomorrow, or
in a few seconds or even milliseconds, the context will be totally different. There-
fore, such systems process ambiguities represented by superpositions of alternatives.
Mathematically, ambiguity-superpositions are described as linear combinations of
quantum states. For cognitive systems, they are interpreted as the belief states.
We illustrate such information processing with the following toy example. Ivan
has a girl friend named Sara; he is not sure whether he loves her or not. His belief
state can be mathematically expressed as a superposition
ψ(t) = c0(t)|not love⟩+ c1(t)|love⟩,
(1.12)
where |c0(t)|2 + |c1(t)|2 = 1. These complex amplitudes determine intensities of his
feeling. They ﬂuctuate in the process of his belief-state evolution.
He can process information in two ways:
• classically: at each instant of time t, Ivan resolves uncertainty and determines
whether he loves Sara and then he updates his behavior on the basis of this infor-
mation;
• quantum-likely: Ivan does not try to resolve uncertainty and proceeds with super-
position |ψ⟩(t).
The latter processing saves a lot of computational and psychic resources. Ivan being
in love superposition can use these resources to solve other life problems. Even
“quantum-like Ivan” may soon or later resolve this ambiguity—to perform the self
measurement. But he may as well proceed with this love superposition for years and
even for his whole life. Self measurement can happen as the result of some external
circumstances since Ivan is an open quantum information system.

Quantum Formalism for
Decision-Making
2.1
Elementary Quantum Vocabulary
Denote by the symbol H a complex Hilbert space, the scalar product of two vectors
ψ and φ is denoted as ⟨ψ|φ⟩. We consider only ﬁnite dimensional state spaces, as
typically one does in quantum information theory. Real physics is based on inﬁnite
dimensional Hilbert spaces, such as the space L2 of square integrable functions.
Pure States
A pure quantum state is mathematically represented by a normalized vector in
H, ||ψ||2 = ⟨ψ|ψ⟩= 1. Two vectors ψ1 and ψ2 such that ψ2 = eiθψ1 correspond
to the same pure quantum state. To be rigorous, a pure state is a class of normalized
vectors which differ by phase factors. Thus, one should be careful with geometric
illustration for operations on pure states (cf. [89]).
Since H is a linear space, it is possible to form linear combinations of its vectors;
in the quantum formalism linear combinations (with normalization) are known as
state superpositions.
By choosing in H some orthonormal basis, it can be represented as the space of
vectors with complex coordinates, ψ = (z1, z2, . . . , zn), z j ∈C, where C is the set
of complex numbers. The scalar product is deﬁned as
⟨u|v⟩=

i
¯uivi, u = (u1, . . . , un), v = (v1, . . . , vn),
(2.1)
where, for a complex number z = x + iy, x, y ∈R, its conjugate is denoted by ¯z,
here ¯z = x −iy. The absolute value of z is given by |z|2 = z¯z = x2 + y2.
Von Neumann Observables - Hermitian Operators
In the standard quantum measurement theory (due to von Neumann [451]), an observ-
able a is mathematically represented by a Hermitian operator A (thus, A = A⋆). Its

Quantum Formalism for Decision-Making
eigenvalues (spectrum)1 encode the possible outcomes, α = α1, . . . , αk. This is the
spectral postulate of quantum mechanics.
By choosing an orthonormal basis H can be represented as H = Cn and an
observable as a Hermitian matrix, i.e., A = (ai j), where
ai j = ¯a ji.
Matrix’s eigenvalues encode the outputs of observations. Thus, the quantum mea-
surement model is mathematically formalized as the linear algebraic calculus. Due
to linearity quantum theory is mathematically very simple. Simplicity is one of the
attractive sides of this theory.
Consider an observable a with Hermitian operator A. Let E(α) be projection on
the eigenspace of vectors corresponding to the eigenvalue α. So, E(α) is projection on
the subspace of H consisting of all vectors satisfying the linear equation Aψ = αψ.
Denote this subspace Hα. The operator A can be represented as the weighted some
of its eigen-projections (the spectral decomposition):
A =

α
αE(α).
(2.2)
If, for some eigenvalue α, the subspace Hα is one dimensional, then it is generated
by one eigenvector. Such eigenvalue is called nondegenerate. If all eigenvalues of A
are nondegenerate, then A has nondegenerate spectrum.
In Dirac’s notation (Sect. 16.10), the eigenstate for nondegenerate eigenvalue is
denoted by the symbol |α⟩, i.e., A|α⟩= α|α⟩. To represent quantum states, eigen-
vectors are normalized, i.e., ⟨α|α⟩= 1. Often Dirac notations are extended to all
vectors, i.e., ψ ∈H, is denoted by the symbol |ψ⟩. Projection E on the vector |ψ⟩
is denoted as |ψ⟩⟨ψ|. Such notations generate a kind of algebra, e.g., E acts on the
vector |φ⟩as the formal multiplication
E|φ⟩= |ψ⟩⟨ψ||φ⟩= ⟨ψ|φ⟩|ψ⟩.
(2.3)
In Dirac’s notation the spectral decomposition of a Hermitian operator with nonde-
generate spectrum can be written as
A =

α
α|α⟩⟨α|.
(2.4)
We don’t not use Dirac’s notation consistently, but operate with both symbols ψ and
|ψ⟩.
For the state ψ, the probability of the outcome α is given by the Born rule:
P(a = α|ψ) = ⟨E(α)ψ|ψ⟩= ∥E(α)ψ∥2.
(2.5)
1 Since H is ﬁnite dimensional spectrum is reduced to the set of operator’s eigenvalues.

2.1 Elementary Quantum Vocabulary
13
If eigenvalue α is nondegenerate, then since E(α)|ψ⟩= ⟨α|ψ⟩|α⟩, the Born rule can
be written as
P(a = α|ψ) = |⟨α|ψ⟩⟩|2,
(2.6)
cf. (1.1).
For an observable a represented by Hermitian operator A, a measurement with
the outcome a = α generates back-action onto system’s state:
ψ →ψα = E(α)ψ/∥E A(α)ψ∥.
(2.7)
This is the projection postulate in the Lüders form [341] (see Sect. 16.3). If the
eigenvalue α is nondegenerate, then ψ is projected on the eigenvector |α⟩(with the
corresponding normalization):
ψ →ψα = |α⟩.
(2.8)
Representation of Mixed States by Density Operators
Án operator B is positively deﬁned, B ≥0, if the corresponding quadratic form is
non-negative: for any vector ψ ∈H, ⟨Aψ|ψ⟩≥0.
Generally quantum theory works with the quantum states given by density oper-
ators. Typically, such quantum state is interpreted as describing a statistical mixture
of pure states.2 A density operator ρ is determined by the conditions:
• ρ = ρ⋆(so, it is a Hermitian operator)
• ρ ≥0,
• Trρ = 1.
The space of density operators is denoted by the symbol D ≡D(H). We remark
that each pure state can be represented by a density operator, projection on the state
vector, see (2.3).
If a quantum state is mathematically described as a density operator ρ, then the
Born’s rule has the form:
P(a = α|ρ) = TrρE(α).
(2.9)
(see Chap. 16 for detail). The state update is given by the formula
ρ →ρα = E(α)ρE(α)/TrE(α)ρE(α).
(2.10)
In Sect. 2.3 we will discuss the comparative interpretation of the states represented
by normalized vectors and density operators.
Compatible Versus Incompatible Observables
In contrast to classical physics, in quantum physics some observables can’t be jointly
measured.Theyarecalledincompatible.Inthemathematicalformalismincompatible
2 Although this interpretation is widely used in physics and it will be also often used in this book,
it is ambiguous, since the same density operator ρ can represent different statistical mixtures.

14

Quantum Formalism for Decision-Making
observables a and b are represented by noncommutative operators (matrices) A and
B, i.e.,
[A, B] ̸= 0.
Compatible observables a and b can be jointly measurable and, hence, their joint
probability distribution (JPD) is well deﬁned. They are represented by commuting
Hermitian operators A and B. Commutativity of operators implies commutativity of
their projections onto eigensubspaces,
[Ea(α), Eb(β)] = 0,
for all eigenvalues α and β. In quantum formalism JPD for compatible observables
(for joint measurements on systems in state ψ) is deﬁned by the equality:
P(a = α, b = β|ψ) = ∥Eb(β)Ea(α)ψ∥2 = ∥Ea(α)Eb(β)ψ∥2,
(2.11)
How can JPD be deﬁned in the case of incompatible observables?
They are not jointly measurable and formally JPD, as the probability of the pair-
wise outcomes (a = α, b = β) is not deﬁned. However, conditional probability is
well deﬁned even for incompatible quantum observables (Sect. 16.5). Hence, one
can use the quantum analog of the CP-formula (1.6) connecting JPD and conditional
probability. Of course, for incompatible observables this is not JPD in the usual sense,
but so to say sequential JPD:
P(a = α, b = β|ψ) ≡P(a = α; ψ)P(b = β|a = α; ψ) == ∥Eb(β)Ea(α)ψ∥2.
(2.12)
In CP the same JPD can be deﬁned either via formula (1.6) or formula (1.7). The
QP analogs of these formulas lead to the different answers that is not surprising:
formula (2.12) determines the sequential a →b JPD, but the the sequential b →a
JPD is given by
P(b = β, a = α|ψ) ≡P(b = β; ψ)P(a = α|b = β; ψ) == ∥Ea(α)Eb(β)ψ∥2.
(2.13)
and if [A, B] ̸= 0, then the right hand sides of (2.12) and (2.13) do not need coincide.
Projection Valued Measures - PVMs
In physics, the values of observables are real numbers, the eigenvalues of Hermitian
operators. We point out that the right hand side of the Born rule contains only orthog-
onal projectors and association of them with real numbers is not crucial. Instead of
eigenvalues, we can consider just some index labeling orthogonal projections. This
label can belong to any set X and then the probability distribution given by the Born
rule is deﬁned on the set X. For example, X can be the set of all possible words
in Russian or Chinese language, set of possible conscious experiences, decisions,
questions, emotions. This possibility to operate with an arbitrary set of symbols X is

2.2 Quantum-Like Model for Decision-Making
15
very important for applications outside of physics. For simplicity, we consider ﬁnite
set of outcomes
X = {x1, . . . , xm}.
(2.14)
We recall that the spectral family of orthogonal projections for a Hermitian oper-
ator A satisﬁes the normalization condition

x
E(x) = I.
(2.15)
where I is the unit operator, and the mutual orthogonality condition
E(x) ⊥E(y), x ̸= y.
(2.16)
Now, let us represent an observable a with the range of values X by the family
of orthogonal projectors, E = (E(x))x∈X satisfying two constraints (2.15), (2.16).
They guarantee that, for any state ψ, the quantity determined by the Born rule can
be interpreted as probability, i.e., it is normalized by one

x∈X
P(a = x|ψ) = 1.
(2.17)
Such family of projectors (E(x))x∈X determines a projector-valued measure (PVM),
μ(G) =

x∈G
E(x),
(2.18)
where G is a subset of X.
Sometimes (especially in Chap. 6), we use PVMs for mathematical representation
of observables. This is very natural generalization of the Hermitian operator repre-
sentation. Later (Chap. 8) we invent a larger class of observables given by positive
operator valued measures (POVMs). Observables given by PVM will be called von
Neumann observables. (We remark that typically von Neumann observables are
identiﬁed with Hermitian operators.)
2.2
Quantum-Like Model for Decision-Making
The belief (mental) state of a decision maker, say Alice, is represented as a quantum
state, typically by a pure state ψ belonging to H (space of belief states). Generally
belief states are represented by density operators.3
3 The idea to represent mental states as quantum states was elaborated by a few authors, see, e.g.,
my works [230, 231, 241–243], see also [87, 89, 90, 386–388].

16
2
Quantum Formalism for Decision-Making
The problem of the belief state’s interpretation is the cognitive counterpart of the
problem of the quantum state interpretation - the “wave function interpretation prob-
lem”. The latter is one the main foundational problems of QM and it is characterized
by the diversity of the viewpoints (Chap. 20).
A decision problem is a question a which is asked to Alice or a task which she must
perform (to select some output). In the quantum-like framework a is mathematically
described by a quantum observable. General mathematical formalization of quan-
tum observables is given within the theory of quantum instruments (Chap. 8). For
the beginning, we start with the simplest quantum observables given by Hermitian
operators.
So, say a question (or task) a is represented by a Hermitian operator A, its eigen-
values encode possible answers to this question, (task). For Alice in the belief state
ψ, the probability P(a = α j|ψ) of decision α is given by the Born rule (2.5); if the
belief state is given by density operator ρ, then probability is calculated with formula
(2.9).
In decision modeling, it is important to determine not only the probabilities of
various decisions, but also the transformation of belief states resulting from decision-
making. In the simplest model, the decision with the outcome a = α induces pro-
jection of the belief state ψ onto the α-eigenspace Hα of the Hermitian operator A,
see (2.7); if state is mixed then the state update is given by (2.10).
We remark that in the case of nondegenerate eigenvalue α the formulas for calcula-
tion of probability and the state update are simpliﬁed (at least for the pure initial state
ψ), see (2.6), (2.8). And a newcomer in the ﬁeld of quantum-like modeling might
be attracted by this simplicity and the illustrative power of drawing vectors and their
projections. However, by some reason mental observables can’t be represented by
Hermitian operators with nondegenerate spectra (Sect. 16.5).
In fact, the situation is even more complex. In contrast to physics, where one can
proceed rather far with Hermitian operators and the state update of the projection
type, in psychology and cognition even the simplest psychological effects can’t be
modeled in this way, more general belief state updates have to be used, updates
described by quantum instruments (Chap. 8).
2.3
Decision-Making via Decoherence
In Sect. 4.5, we consider another quantum-like framework which is known as quan-
tum dynamical decision-making or decoherence decision-making. Here the decision
states are steady states of the open quantum system dynamics describing the belief
(mental) state’s evolution in the process of decision-making. Such modeling of deci-
sion state generation found many applications, from genetics and molecular biology
to psychology and cognition, ecology and sociology [18–21, 24, 25].4
4 In Chap. 4 the decoherence framework is used to model approaching of stability in biosystems,
from proteins and cells to ecological systems.

2.3 Decision-Making via Decoherence
17
The belief state is mathematically described by a density operator. Its evolution
t →ρ(t) in the process of decision-making is modeled by the open quantum system
dynamics (Sect. 4.4). Its Markovean (i.e., memoryless) approximation is given by
Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) equation; in this book we mainly
operate with this approximate dynamical equation, the simplest quantum master
equation.
One of the distinguishing features of the open quantum system dynamics is that
it immediately transfers a pure state given by a vector |ψ⟩into a mixture of pure
states described by a density operator ρ. In the quantum-like modeling of decision-
making, this mathematical property is interpreted as destruction of the purity of
Alice’s belief state resulting from interaction with surrounding psycho-physical envi-
ronment. Thus, if Alice initially was in the state ρt0 = |ψ⟩⟨ψ|, then typically at any
t > t0 her state is a statistical mixture of pure states which is mathematically repre-
sented by a density operator ρ(t). This transformation of a pure state into statistical
mixture is known as decoherence.
Decoherence is a complex foundational notion of quantum mechanics [442]. We
proceed with the operational deﬁnition, “pure state →statistical mixture”. A pure
state |ψ⟩can be represented as superposition of eigenstates of the Hermitian operator
A representing the question a asked to Alice:
|ψ⟩=

α
cα|α⟩,
(2.19)
where 
α p(a = α|ψ) = 
α |cα|2 = 1.
The open quantum system dynamics destroys this superposition; so decoherence
can be treated as destruction of superpositions. In probabilistic terms, superposi-
tion corresponds to interference of probabilities and “quantumness of probability”
(Sect. 16.6). Hence decoherence destroys interference and transfer QPs into CPs;
so to say quantumness is destroyed by decoherence. Quantitatively the degree of
quantumness can be expressed through state’s purity (Sect. 4.8). Here we are not
able to go deeper into the discussion on the decoherence interpretation.
Thus, before starting the process of decision-making, e.g., preparing an answer to
the question a, Alice forms superposition (2.19) of belief states (|α⟩) corresponding
possible answers. This is the state of deep quantum uncertainty. For example, Alice
can assign the equal weights to all possible answers, p(a = α|ψ) = 1/N, where N
is the number of possible answers. However, even such superposition is probabilis-
tically different from the classical uniform probability distribution. This difference
is not visible in operating with just a single question a. But consideration of another
question b would demonstrate this difference via the interference of probabilities,
given by FTP with the interference term (1.11). To see interference, question b should
be incompatible with question a, i.e., their operators do not commute, [A, B] ̸= 0.
Quantumness of superposition is encoded in phases of the complex coefﬁcients
cα = ⟨α|ψ⟩= |cα|eiθα.

18

Quantum Formalism for Decision-Making
Even for equal amplitudes |cα|, the pure states with different phases react to mea-
surements in different way. And these states differ crucially from the state given by
the density operator
ρ =

α
|cα|2|α⟩⟨α|.
So, initially Alice is in the state of deep uncertainty (2.19); her aim is to resolve
this uncertainty. We describe her process of decision-making by the open quantum
system dynamics. It transfers superposition into the classical statistical mixture ρ(t).
In our model of decision-making via decoherence, a decision state is given by a steady
state of this dynamics.
ρdecision = lim
t→∞ρ(t)
(2.20)
(if this limit exists). Of course, this limit procedure is just the mathematical idealiza-
tion, it encodes damping of state’s ﬂuctuations, and damping is due to the interaction
with system’s environment. Hence,
ρdecision ≈ρ(τ),
(2.21)
for sufﬁciently large τ (w.r.t. decision maker’s temporal scale).
How does Alice extract the concrete answer from the classical probability distri-
bution given by the density operator (2.20)? One of the solutions is that at the ﬁnal
stage of the decision process, i.e., after approaching the steady state, Alice uses the
classical random generator to select the answer a = α; probabilities are encoded in
ρdecision. We discuss this complex problem in more detail in Sect. 6.5.
2.4
Decision Paradoxes
The use of the quantum-like models can resolve some paradoxes of classical the-
ory of decision-making. Such paradoxes started to be suggested immediately after
publication of the book of von Neumann and Morgenstern [450] on expected utility
theory, e.g., the Allais [7] (1953), Ellsberg [144] (1961), and Machina [342] (1987)
paradoxes. See Chap. 19 for brief presentation of the Allais and Ellsberg paradoxes.
The ﬁrst one is the paradox of expected utility theory which basics were set von
Neumann and Morgenstern [450] and the second one is the paradox of subjective
expected utility theory which basics were set by Savage [400].
Typically a paradox (as a sign of irrational behavior) is probabilistically expressed
as the violation of the law of additivity of probability (or FTP), i.e., that
P(A1 ∪A2) ̸= P(A1) + P(A2), for A1 ∩A2 = ∅.

2.4 Decision Paradoxes
19
In turn the latter can be explained by contextuality of probability: one cannot pro-
ceed with a single probability measure P, decision contexts are portrayed with
context-dependent probability spaces and random variables representing decision-
observables (e.g., questions). The paradoxes of decision theories can be mathe-
matically described by the Växjö model for contextual probability theory [251]
(Sect. 17.2) or by Contextuality by Default theory (see, e.g., [131] and Sect. 17.8).
The quantum-like approach provides the general and consistent mathematical repre-
sentation of contextual probabilistic theories (see, e.g., [282] for subjective expected
utility).
The number of paradoxes generated by the classical decision-making theory is
really amazing. The authors of the review [145] counted 35 basic paradoxes. During
many years DM-theory was developed through creation of paradoxes and resolving
them through modiﬁcations of the theory, e.g., from expected utility theory to the
prospect theory. But any modiﬁed theory suffered of new paradoxes. The use of QP
can resolve all such paradoxes, at least this is claimed in papers [27, 282].

Chapter 3
Classical Versus Quantum Rationality
3.1
Savage Sure Thing Principle and Interference
of Probabilities
In classical theory of decision-making, the rational behavior of agents is formalized
with the Savage Sure Thing Principle (STP) [400]:
If you prefer prospect b+ to prospect b−if a possible future event A happens
(a = +1); and you prefer prospect b+ still if future event A does not happen
(a = −1); then you should prefer prospect b+, despite having no knowledge of
whether or not event A will happen.
Savage’s illustration refers to a person deciding whether or not to buy a certain
property shortly before a presidential election, the outcome of which could radically
affect the property market [400]:
“A businessman contemplates buying a certain piece of property. He considers
the outcome of the next presidential election relevant. So, to clarify the matter to
himself, he asks whether he would buy if he knew that the Democratic candidate was
going to win, and decides that he would. Similarly, he considers whether he would
buy if he knew that the Republican candidate was going to win, and again ﬁnds
that he would. Seeing that he would buy in either event, he decides that he should
buy, even though he does not know which event obtains, or will obtain, as we would
ordinarily say. It is all too seldom that a decision can be arrived at on the basis of
this principle, but except possibly for the assumption of simple ordering, I know of no
other extralogical principle governing decisions that ﬁnd such ready acceptance.”
STP is considered as the axiom of rationality of decision makers [400]. It plays the
important role in decision-making and economics in the framework of Savage’s sub-
jective utility theory. In the latter, the probability is formalized in the CP-framework
[318] and it is endowed with the subjective interpretation.
Generally, subjective expected utility theory was challenged by the Ellsberg para-
dox (see Chap. 19). The quantum-like models of subjective expected utility resolving
this paradox were developed in articles [27, 282].

Classical Versus Quantum Rationality
One of the ﬁrst violations of the Savage Sure Thing Principle was found by
Tversky and Shaﬁr [401, 434]. This study was motivated by the behavior of their
own students in San Francisco who had the custom to take their after-exam vacation
in Hawaii. Tversky and Shaﬁr showed that signiﬁcantly more students report that
they would purchase a nonrefundable Hawaii vacation if they knew that they had
passed or failed an important exam as opposed to the case when they did not know
the outcome of the exam. (See articles [248, 282] for quantum-like modeling.)
We stress that STP is a simple consequence of FTP
P(b = β) =

α
P(a = α)P(b = β|a = α).
(3.1)
Here the b-variable determine the decision variable, say b = +1, “buy house”,
b = −1, “not buy house”, and the a-variable represents conditions, say outcomes of
elections. Violation of FTP implies violation of STP. Thus, the degree of satisfaction
of FTP can be used as a statistical test of classical (STP-type) rationality.
Incognitivepsychology,violationofSTPisknownasthedisjunctioneffect. Plenty
ofstatisticaldatawascollectedincognitivepsychologyinexperimentsdemonstrating
disjunction effect. For example, in experiments of the Prisoners’ Dilemma type [221–
225]. Such data violate FTP. The latter implies irrationality (from classical viewpoint)
of agents participating in experiments (mainly students).
We recall that FTP is derived from two assumptions that are ﬁrmly incorporated
into the Kolmogorov axiomatics:
1. Additive law for probability.
2. Baeys formula for conditional probability.
Therefore, violation of FTP and, hence, of STP (and classical rationality) is generated
either by violation of additivity of probability or the Bayes law for conditional proba-
bility or by the combination of these factors. Generally, this leads to the impossibility
to use in decision-making Bayesian inference. Quantum(-like) agents proceed with
more general inference machinery based on the quantum state update.
Hence, classical rationality is Bayesian inference rationality and quantum ratio-
nality is non-Bayesian inference rationality.1
3.2
Quantum-Like Rationality
In the light of above considerations, one can ask
Are quantum agents irrational?
1 Of course, non-Bayesian probability updates are not reduced to quantum ones, given by state
transformations in the complex Hilbert space. One may expect that human decision-making violates
not only classical, but even quantum rationality.

3.2 Quantum-Like Rationality
23
As was discussed, by using QP, it is possible to violate FTP and hence STP.
Therefore, generally quantum-like agents are (classically) irrational. However, we
can question the CP approach to the mathematical formalization of decision-making
and, consequently, the corresponding notion of rationality. We deﬁne quantum(-
like) rationality as respecting the quantum calculus of probabilities and the quantum
formula for interference of probabilities, FTP with the interference term.
In the framework of quantum-like modeling, violation of the CP laws including
the Bayes formula for conditional probability or even additivity of probability are
not exotic at all. Moreover, the situation in which the probabilistic data satisﬁes FTP
seems to be rather an exception than the norm. We can speculate that QP processing of
information was resulted from evolution of biological systems, not only humans, but
even animals and simple bio-organisms. The question whether the “genuine human
behavior” should be characterized by classical rationality taken as the normative
theory for the rational decision-making is very complicated.
Violation of FTP implies violation of STP. Thus, satisfaction of FTP can be used
as a statistical test of rationality.
Plenty of statistical data was collected in cognitive psychology in experiments
demonstrating disjunction effect (works of Shaﬁr, Tversky, Kahneman [401, 434],
[221–225]). Such data violate FTP. The latter implies irrationality of agents partici-
pating in experiments (mainly students). For comparison of classical and quantum-
like rationalities, see also [386, 428].
Generally, the violation of classical rationality is the violation of Bayesian infer-
ence employed for the probability update. The quantum probability update based
on the state update as observation’s feedback is more general and it can lead to the
probability transformations that are impossible within CP and its Bayesian infer-
ence counterpart. This question was highlighted in the article [261] on violation of
Aumann’s theorem by quantum agents.
Logic of Mind
CP is based on classical Boolean logic and QP is based on quantum non-Boolean
logic (Chap. 16). The latter leads to the relaxation of the basic rules of classical
logic, in particular, the distributivity law for conjunction and disjunction. Roughly
speaking, information processing based on the laws of quantum logic is simpler and
needs less computational resources: one can operate in partial Boolean subalgebra
of quantum logic, and one does not need to construct conjunctions, disjunctions,
and negations for all possible events. Such information processing is superior in the
situation of information overload. It saves a lot of information resources.
However, this kind of information processing can lead to inconsistencies between
conclusions which can be derived on the basis of different subalgebras. These incon-
sistencies are behavioral irrationalities (from the viewpoint of Boolean logic) and
probability fallacies—the signs that people can’t adequately operate with proba-
bilities. We claim that people operate very well with probabilities, but they use
non-classical probability calculus, e.g., QP. In fact, QP is the calculus of probabil-
ity amplitudes or complex vector state calculus. Thus, by making decisions in the
state of uncertainty, humans operate with such amplitudes (states) by using the linear

24
3
Classical Versus Quantum Rationality
algebra calculus in complex linear space. Finally, to assign probabilities for possible
outcomes of decision, they transfer amplitudes into probabilities by using the Born
rule.
Finally, we point to article [371] on the quantum logic of human mind. It con-
tains new and interesting approaches to analyze the human mind logical structure,
especially nondistributivity role.
3.3
Coupling of Social Lasing to Deprivation of Classical
Rationality
One of the consequences of information overload is that information loses its con-
tent. A human has no possibility to analyze deeply the content of communications
delivered by mass media and social networks. People process information without
even attempting to construct an extended Boolean algebra of events. They oper-
ate with labels such as Covid-19, vaccination, pandemic, etc., without trying to go
deeper beyond these labels. Contentless information behaves as a bosonic quantum
ﬁeld which is similar to the quantum electromagnetic ﬁeld. Interaction of humans
with such quantum information ﬁelds can generate a variety of quantum-like behav-
ioral effects. One of them is social lasing, stimulated ampliﬁcation of social actions
(SASA) [12, 269, 276, 277, 287, 289, 290] (Chap. 11). In social laser theory,
humans play the role of atoms, social atoms (s-atoms). Interaction of the infor-
mation ﬁeld composed of indistinguishable—up to some parameters, as say social
energy—excitations with a gain medium composed of s-atoms generate the cas-
cade type process of emission of social actions. SASA describes well, e.g., color
revolutions and other types of mass protests.
Over the past years, our society has been constantly shaken by high-amplitude
information waves. These are waves of enormous social energy. They are often
destructive and are a kind of information tsunami. The main distinguishing features
of these waves are their high amplitude, coherence—the homogeneous nature of the
social actions they generate—and the short time required for their generation and
relaxation. These are huge singular spikes.
As shown in the mentioned works, such waves can be modeled by using the social
laser, which describes SASA. “Actions” are interpreted very broadly, from mass
protests, in particular, leading to color revolutions such as the Orange or Maidan
revolutions in Ukraine or the recent mass protests in USA, for example, anti-Baiden
protests for fair votes, Belarus -anti-Lukashenko protests for fair votes, anti-Putin
protests for the liberation of Naval’nii in Russia, Germany, UK, Australia, Canada,
and Sweden, for instance, protests against corona-fascism and violation of the basic
human rights with pandemic-justiﬁcation as well as generating of “right voting” and
other collective decisions such as acceptance of lockdown and support of the total
vaccination against Covid-19 by the majority of population.

3.4 Question Order and Response Replicability Effects

3.4
Question Order and Response Replicability Effects
This section serves as a brief introduction to Chaps. 9, 10, and 14.
The question order effect (QOE) is dependence of the (sequential) joint probability
distribution on questions’ order. In cognitive and social science, the following opinion
pool is known as the basic example of the order effect. This is the Clinton–Gore
opinion pool. In this experiment, American citizens were asked one question at a
time, e.g.
• a = “Is Bill Clinton honest and trustworthy?”
• b = “Is Al Gore honest and trustworthy?”
Two sequential probability distributions were calculated on the basis of the experi-
mental statistical data, Pab and Pba—ﬁrst question a and then question b and vice
verse). And it was found that
Pab ̸= Pba
This is surprising from the CP viewpoint, where aandb are represented as random
variables taking values ±1. In CP, for any pair of values α, β = ±1,
Pab(α, β) = P((a = α) ∧(b = β)) = P((b = β) ∧(a = α)) = Pba(β, α).
Here the key-point is commutativity of the operation of Boolean conjunction which
is CP realized as the set-intersection operation.
We stress that QOE was one of the basic motivations for applying QM-formalism
to psychological phenomena, see article of Wang and Busemeyer [452].
Wang and Busemeyer [452] reasoned that QOE can be modeled by appealing to
incompatible observables which are mathematically represented by noncommutative
Hermitian operators A, B. One observable is the question about Clinton and another
about Gore. From this viewpoint. QOE is a consequence of the existence of incompat-
ible observables. So, in this framework, Pab ̸= Pba is equivalent to noncommutativity
of Hermitian operators A and B representing the questions a, b, i.e.,
[A, B] ̸= 0.
However, the life is not so simple.
For incompatible observables, one operates with sequential JPD given by (2.12).
So,
Pab(α, β|ψ) ≡P(a = α; ψ)P(b = β|a = α; ψ) == ∥Eb(β)Ea(α)ψ∥2,
where Ea(α) and Eb(β) are projection of the Hermitian operators A and B corre-
sponding to eigenvalues α and β. In the same way
Pba(β, α|ψ) ≡P(b = β|ψ)P(a = α|b = β; ψ) = ∥Ea(α)Eb(β)ψ∥2.

26
3
Classical Versus Quantum Rationality
If [A, B] ̸= 0, then, for some α, β, [Ea(α), Eb(β)] ̸= 0, and sequential JPDs do not
need to coincide, i.e., generally
∥Eb(β)Ea(α)ψ∥2 ̸= ∥Ea(α)Eb(β)ψ∥2.
(3.2)
A strong objection to the Wang-Busemeyer strategy w.r.t. QOE, i.e., using Her-
mitian operators to represent mental observables, e.g., questions asked to people,
was presented in paper [262] (see Chap. 14). This objection is based on the response
replicability effect (RRE) which also plays the important role in QM.
Suppose that Alice is asked some question a and she replies, e.g., “yes”. If imme-
diately after answering she is asked this question again, then she replies “yes” with
probability one. We call this property a −a response replicability.
All quantum measurements represented by Hermitian operators and the resulting
state update given by the projection postulate satisfy a −a response replicability,
because any projection is idempotent, E2 = E.
The Clinton–Gore opinion poll as well as any decision-making experiment satis-
ﬁes a −a response replicability. If Alice has answered “yes” to question a, then she
will repeat this answer (with probability 1), if this question will be repeated. Human
decision-making has another distinguishing feature which can be called a −b −a
response replicability. Suppose that after answering the a-question with say the “yes”
answer, Alice is asked another question b. She replied to it with some answer. And
then she is asked the question a again. In the social opinion pools and other natu-
ral decision-making experiments, Alice deﬁnitely repeats her original answer to a,
“yes”. This is a −b −a response replicability. Combination of a −a with a −b −a
and b −a −b response replicability is called the response replicability effect.
Is it possible to combine the order and response replicability effects by using the
quantum formalism?
As was pointed out in paper [262] (see Chap. 14), by using the calculus of Hermi-
tian observables and the projection postulate it is impossible to combine RRE with
QOE. In short, to generate QOE Hermitian operators A, B should be noncommuta-
tive, but the latter destroys a −b −a response replicability of A. This was the very
strong objection to the use of the quantum formalism in psychology. The impossibil-
ity of QP-modeling RRE+QOE was considered as the ﬁrst paradox of QP decision
theory. After publication of article [262], even the main actors of the quantum-like
modeling, including the book author, were in doubts whether the quantum formalism
is adequate to human behavior.
However, recently the problem of combination of RRE and QOE has been
solved withing the quantum formalism, but by using a more advanced mathemati-
cal formalism—quantum instrument theory describing generalized quantum observ-
ables. Psychological data can be described by quantum theory, but by its modern and
advanced formalism, the instrument theory [369, 370] (Chaps. 8, 9, and 10).
We remark that representation of quantum observables by Hermitian operators
and realization of the state update with orthogonal projectors is too restrictive even
in quantum physics, especially in quantum information theory. Generally, quantum

3.5 State-Dependent Incompatibility
27
observables are represented by positive operator valued measures (POVMs) and
the process of measurement by quantum instruments. However, the basic quantum
observables, position, momentum, spin, energy, can be mathematically described by
Hermitian operators and the state update by the projection postulate. For cognitive
systems, the situation is worse, even such simple cognitive effects as QOE and RRE
can’t be modeled without appealing to generalized observables.
Theory of quantum instruments is mathematically quite complicated and we post-
pone its presentation and application to modeling combinations of psychological
effects to Chaps. 8, 9, and 10. The readers who are interested merely in psychology
and cognition can jump directly to these chapters. In fact, I am surprized that even the
basic mental observables, in contrast to the physical observables such as say position,
momentum, and energy, can’t be mathematically described by Hermitian operators
and from the very beginning one has to use the generalized quantum observables.
3.5
State-Dependent Incompatibility
In connection with QOE, it is natural to point to the notion of state-dependent incom-
patibility. This notion is not so widely used in quantum physics, because there the
basic incompatible physical observables are represented by noncommutative oper-
ators (cf., however, Ozawa [364–367] and especially his article [368]). However, it
seems that in applications to cognition and decision-making belief-state dependence
plays the important role. Let us look at inequality (3.2). To be sure in the presence
of QOE, it is sufﬁcient to ﬁnd such a belief-state ψ that this inequality holds for this
concrete ψ. The necessary condition for this is the ψ-state noncommutativity, i.e.,
that
[Ea(α), Eb(β)]ψ ̸= 0.
(3.3)
This notion has not been yet widely used in quantum-like modeling (see only article
[370]).
We also remark that noncommutativity of two operators, [A, B] ̸= 0, does not
imply state noncommutativity for an arbitrary state ψ. For some pairs of noncom-
mutative operators, there can exist the states such that [A, B]ψ = 0. For such states,
QOE is impossible, in spite of noncommutativity of the operators representing
observables. Thus, it is more useful to operate with state-based compatibility and
incompatibility of observables.

Part II
Biosystems as Open Quantum-Like
Systems
Any alive biosystem is an open system and to analyze its behavior is reasonable
to take advantage of the open quantum systems theory, whether the biosystems are
acknowledged as information processors and the open quantum systems theory is
treated as a part of the quantum information theory. The latter is the most general
information theory comprising the classical information theory as a particular case,
thus this part of the book concerns information processing in complex biosystems.
From the information viewpoint, even a cell or a protein are very complex systems.
We emphasize again that this book is not on the genuine quantum physical processes
in biosystems and we apply the quantum-like theory of open systems. In particular,
its application is not constrained by the system’s size, but is applicable on all scales of
space, time, and complexity, from genomes, proteins, and cells, to animals, humans,
and ecological and social systems.
Treating of biosystems as quantum-like information processors can expound order
stability in them, i.e., present the quantum-like formalization of Schrödinger’s spec-
ulations in his notorious book “What is life?”. The process of biosystem’s adaptation
to the surrounding environment is described by the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-
Lindblad Equation, where the Von Neumann and linear quantum entropies are
employed as measures of the disorder degree. We highlight the role of quantum
dynamics class in generating the camel-like shape for quantum entropies. Camel’s
hump represents: (a) the entropy increase in the process of the initial adaptation to the
environment; (b) the entropy decrease at the post-adaptation stage of the dynamics.
Ouranalysisisbasedonnumericalsimulation,andtodescribesuchaclassofquantum
dynamics analytically is a must-have.
The quantum information treatment of order stability in compound biosystems
leads to an interesting result. Global stability can be preserved in spite of an increase
of disorder in subsystems. Such behavior is impossible in the classical information
framework.
As an application of the open quantum systems theory to cognition, we suggest a
quantum-like model of the brain’s functioning. In this model, the general approach of
this book—to start directly with the quantum information representation of byosys-
tems’ states—is broken. We start with the consideration of electrochemical states of

30
Part II: Biosystems as Open Quantum-Like Systems
neurons encoded in action potentials. Such states generate the brain’s mental states
which are processed with the open quantum systems dynamics.
The complex problem of mathematical formalization of consciousness and uncon-
sciousness and their interaction can also be handled within the open quantum systems
theory. Consciousness plays the role of an apparatus performing measurements over
unconsciousness. This formalism matches well with the Higher Order Theory of
Consciousness. It is applied to model mathematically the emotional coloring of
conscious experiences. Such coloring is framed as contextualization. So, the theory
of emotions is coupled to such a hot topic in quantum foundations as contextuality.
Finally, we discuss the Bell type experiments for emotional coloring.

Chapter 4
What is Life? Open Quantum Systems

4.1
Schrödinger About Life
Schrödinger pointed out to order stability as one of the main distinguishing features
of biosystems. Entropy is the basic quantitative measure of order. In physical sys-
tems, entropy has the tendency to increase (Second Law of Thermodynamics for
isolated classical systems and dissipation in open classical and quantum systems).
Schrödinger emphasized the ability of biosystems to beat this tendency. As was
shown in article [19], a biosystem S which processes information in the quantum-
like way can preserve or even improve its order structure in the process of information
exchange with environment E. This order stability is of the dynamical nature, i.e., not
simply constancy of entropy, but its stabilization generally to the level not exceeding
entropy of the initial state. We emphasize the role of the special class of quantum
dynamics and initial states generating the camel-like shape for entropy-evolution in
the process of interaction with a new environment1 E:
• (1) entropy (disorder) increasing in the process of adaptation to the speciﬁc features
of surrounding environment E;
• (2) entropy decreasing (order increasing) resulting from adaptation;
• (3) the restoration of order or even its increase for limiting steady state. In the
latter case the entropy of the steady state can become even lower than the entropy
of the initial state.
The results of this chapter on the camel-like behavior of entropy are based merely
on numerical simulation and creation of the corresponding theory is an interesting
and important problem.
We recall that Schrödinger’s book [406] (1944) had the big inﬂuence on the future
interplay between physics and biology and development of biophysics. The book’s
title poses one of the most fundamental questions of the modern science “What

What is Life? Open Quantum Systems Approach
is life?”. We are still far from obtaining an answer to it, may be no closer than
Schrödinger was in 1944. The main distinguishing feature of biosystems (from a
physicist’s viewpoint) was presented by Schrödinger [406] as follows:
“What is the characteristic feature of life? When is a piece of matter said to be
alive? When it goes on ‘doing something’, moving, exchanging material with its
environment, and so forth, and that for a much longer period than we would expect
of an inanimate piece of matter to ‘keep going’ under similar circumstances.”
In his book [406], Schrödinger compared order stability in biosystems with the
state evolution for non-living system:
“When a system that is not alive is isolated or placed in a uniform environment, all
motion usually comes to a standstill very soon as a result of various kinds of friction;
differences of electric or chemical potential are equalized, substances which tend to
form a chemical compound do so, temperature becomes uniform by heat conduction.
After that the whole system fades away into a dead, inert lump of matter. A permanent
state is reached, in which no observable events occur. The physicist calls this the state
of thermodynamical equilibrium, or of maximum entropy’. Practically, a state of this
kind is usually reached very rapidly. Theoretically, it is very often not yet an absolute
equilibrium, not yet the true maximum of entropy. But then the ﬁnal approach to‘
equilibrium is very slow.”
See also widely cited paper of Gatenby and Frieden [172]:
“Living systems are distinguished in nature by their ability to maintain stable,
ordered states far from equilibrium. This is despite constant buffeting by thermody-
namic forces that, if unopposed, will inevitably increase disorder.”
Schrödinger pointed out that biosystems do not follow the laws of classical
physics. Their behavior looks strange especially from the thermodynamical view-
point. They are able (in an unclear way) to violate the Second Law of Thermodynam-
ics. In principle, this is not surprising, since biosystems are fundamentally open sys-
tems. Schrödinger emphasized that a completely isolated biosystem is simply dead.
And he pointed out that a biosystem is able to escape following the Second Law of
Thermodynamics only via exchange with its environment. But, then he pointed to
the main question related to this process:
What kind of exchange characterizes stability of a living system? Matter? Energy?
Of course, biosystems are continuously performing such exchanges and, in this
way, they preserve their material and energy order. But, Schrödinger remarks that
the same is done by non-alive systems. So, neither matter nor energy exchange can
lead to bio-violation of Second Law of Thermodynamics and guarantee stability of
biosystems.
Schrödinger tried to resolve the mystery of life by using the approach that nowa-
days is known as quantum biophysics (so, he was one of its fathers). He compared
quantum physical processes with biological ones; in particular, he compared the role
of a physical molecular with gene, as carriers of information. However, he did not
succeed in resolution of life’s mystery. Then, in the last part of the book he considered

4.1 Schrödinger About Life
33
the phenomenon of life from the viewpoint of entropy exchange between a biosystem
S and environment E. This was one of the ﬁrst steps toward information treatment of
biological processes.
He noted that formally stability and order’s preservation within a biosystem S can
be modeled by means of negative entropy. So, S consumes negative entropy from
the environment E and, in this way, it compensates its own entropy increase, and
consequently preserve order inside it. But, appealing to such a notion as negative
entropy is really speculative, albeit philosophically attractive. Schrödinger’s specu-
lations on peculiarities of entropy transfer as the basis for preservation of alive-states
can be interpreted as the ﬁrst step toward study of the phenomenon of life from the
positions of information theory.
We stress that by explaining the basis of order preserving in living systems,
Schrödinger did not have in mind explanation of homeostasis: the state of steady
internal, physical, and chemical conditions maintained by living systems. (Home-
ostasis is mathematically described by the feedback loop models with balance equa-
tions. Nowadays, with sensors and computing blocks, it is easy to construct a physical
system in the state of energy, material, and chemical homeostasis.) In [406], biosta-
bility was stability of interconnected regulation mechanisms including processing of
mental information by the brain.
Finally, he concluded that it would be impossible to explain bio-behavior within
the known laws of physics, neither classical nor quantum. May be new physical laws
will be formulated to explain the phenomenon of life. Although quantum information
theory is the result of the natural evolution of quantum theory, its creation is often
called the second quantum revolution - to highlight the novelty of the applications of
the quantum concepts, methodology, and mathematical formalism, to foundations,
theory, experiment, and engineering.
The main message of Schrödinger’s book [406] was that biosystems are subject
not only to material or energy constraints imposed by the physical environment, but
also to the information constraints imposed by the information environment. Biosys-
tems are considered as open systems interacting with their physico-informational
environments. Nowadays, this viewpoint is well accommodated in biology, see, e.g.,
Gatenby and Frieden [172]:
“Ina1970review[217],Johnsoncharacterizedinformationtheory(IT)asa“gen-
eral calculus for biology. It is clear that life without matter and energy is impossible.
Johnson’s manuscript emphasized that life without information is likewise impossi-
ble. Since the article, remarkable progress has been made toward understanding the
informational basis for life...”
However, after a few years of successful applications of classical information
theory to biology, the bio-community started to recognize its limitations [172]: “it
seems clear that, in the 35 years since Johnson’s original article, IT using tra-
ditional Shannon methods has not become, as predicted, the “general calculus”
of biology. Although the lack of wide spread application is probably the result of
multiple limitations...” In [172], Gatenby and Frieden stressed that in further appli-
cations of information theory in biology, “the focus will be on new methods... .” In
particular, researchers “address limitations of the IT methodology by applying new

including
bio-informatics, dynamical systems, game theory, graph theory, and measurement
theory.”
We remark that the process of IT-reconsideration of biology was closely connected
with the similar process in physics. Modern physics differs essentially from physics
of the middle of the last century. Highlighting the role of information is one of the
main outputs of development of physical theory, starting with Wheeler’s “It from bit”
[463] to the recent quantum information revolution (known as the second quantum
revolution in physics).
4.2
Theory of Open Quantum Systems and Order
in Biosystems
We present a quantum information reformulation of Schrödinger’s discussion on
biostability as based on entropy exchange with biosystem’s environment. Our sug-
gestion is to treat entropy on the basis of quantum information theory (as the von
Neumann entropy [451] or linear entropy). By using this theory, we follow the afore-
mentioned recommendation of Gatenby and Frieden to focus on new methods in
the information approach in biology. The quantum entropy represents uncertainty in
distribution of quantum information states. And the open quantum systems theory
provides such new methods.
For open quantum systems, the problem of escaping transition to disorder can be
formalized with quantum Markov dynamics. Within this theory, we demonstrated
(with the concrete quantum master equations) that a biosystem S with quantum-
like information processing can preserve or even improve its order structure in the
process of information exchange with its environment E. This order stability is of
the dynamical nature, i.e., not simply constancy of entropy, but its stabilization to
the level not exceeding the entropy of the initial state.
In introduction to this chapter we highlighted the role of the camel-like behavior
of the quantum entropy (Sect. 4.6) in the process of interaction of the system with
the surrounding environment and proposed a bio-information interpretation of such
behavior, as three stage dynamics. In the framework of quantum Markov dynamics,
we present an illustrative example of such behavior, see (4.21), (4.22) and Figs. 4.1
and 4.3; in Sect. 4.7 we describe the class of quantum Markov dynamics for which
the camel-like behavior is impossible; they are well known in physics - the unital
dynamics. Such dynamics were highlighted in studies on the quantum version of the
Second Law of Thermodynamics [334] (see also [203]).
Apart from the basic quantum entropy, the von Neumann entropy [451], we ana-
lyze behavior of the linear entropy reﬂecting decoherence of the system’s quan-
tum state (Sect. 4.8). As we see (Fig. 4.3), quantum Markov dynamics can prevent
decoherence and even increase the state’s coherence. This feature of quantum state
dynamics is very important for modeling information processes in (open) biosystems.

4.3 Supplement to Elementary Quantum Vocabulary
35
We conclude by highlighting the problem of the mathematical description of the
possible states of a living system S and speculate that such states should generate the
camel-like dynamics of the quantum entropies for all possible surrounding (physico-
informational) environments (Sect. 4.10).
The essence of this chapter is the biological interpretation of the well known math-
ematical results and highlighting the special class of quantum master equations which
phenomenologically describe biologically-natural adaptive behavior. The question
“What is life?” is very complex and this book does not pretend to give the ﬁnal answer.
This is just a step toward quantum information formalization of Schrödinger’s ideas.
4.3
Supplement to Elementary Quantum Vocabulary
Here we deliver a new portion of the quantum formalism (see also Sect. 2.1 and
Chap. 16). As always we work with ﬁnite dimensional state space, Hilbert space H
with the scalar product ⟨ψ1|ψ2⟩. Denote the space of linear operators in H by the
symbol L(H). We recall again that we work in ﬁnite dimensional linear space. In the
inﬁnite-dimensional case one should use the space of bounded (continuous) linear
operators.
An operator U ∈L(H) is called unitary if it preserves the scalar product on H,
i.e., ⟨Uψ|Uψ⟩= ⟨ψ|ψ⟩. One important consequence of unitarity is that
U −1 = U ⋆,
(4.1)
the inverse operator coincides with the adjoint operator.
An operator Q ∈L(H) is called positive, Q ≥0, if its quadratic form is positively
semi-deﬁnite, i.e., ⟨ψ|Q|ψ⟩≥0 for any vector ψ ∈H.
4.3.1
Superoperators and Quantum Channels
We remark that the space of linear operators L(H) is by itself a complex linear space.
It is equipped with the scalar product
⟨A|B⟩= TrA⋆B, A, B, ∈L(H).
(4.2)
Thus, L(H) has the Hilbert space structure.
We consider linear operators acting in this Hilbert space, T : L(H) →L(H).
Such operators are called superoperators.
A superoperator T : L(H) →L(H) is called positive, T ≥0, if it maps the set
of positive operators into itself, i.e., T Q ≥0, for any Q ≥0; in particular, for a
density operator ρ, T ρ ≥0.

36

What is Life? Open Quantum Systems Approach
We remark that the space of density operators D ≡D(H) is a convex subset of
L(H). In future studies we will be interested in superoperators for which D is an
invariant subset, i.e., T (D) ⊂D.
To deﬁne a quantum channel, we have to introduce the notion of completely posi-
tivity for a superoperator. The heuristic meaning of this notion is not straightforward.
In Chap. 8 (Sect. 8.2) it will be discussed in very detail. For the moment, one can
treat completely positivity just as some generalization of the notion of positivity.
A superoperator T : L(H) →L(H) is called completely positive if its natural
extension T ⊗I to the tensor product L(H) ⊗L(M) = L(H ⊗M), where M is an
arbitrary ﬁnite dimensional complex Hilbert space, is again a positive superoperator
on L(H) ⊗L(M).
Let S be a physical system with state space H. The extension T ⊗I means that
one takes into account the presence of another system S′ (with state space M) which
does not interact with S. But I does not disturb the state of S′. So, it is natural to
expect that T ⊗I should map the states of the compound system (S, S′) into its
states.
Deﬁnition A quantum channel is any trace-preserving completely positive
superoperator
T : L(H) →L(H).
In particular, for any ρ ∈D, T ρ ∈D.
4.3.2
Von Neumann Entropy
The von Neumann entropy is deﬁned as
S(ρ) = −Trρ ln ρ,
(4.3)
where ρ is a density operator.
There exists an orthonormal basis | j⟩consisting of eigenvectors of ρ, i.e.,
ρ| j⟩= p j| j⟩
(where p j ≥0 and 
j p j = 1). In this basis, the matrix of the operator ρ ln ρ has
the form diag(pj ln pj; ) hence
S(ρ) = −

j
p j ln p j.
(4.4)
This is the classical Shannon entropy for the probability distribution (p j). However,
the von Neumann entropy has the classical form, but only w.r.t. this to special basis.
We present three basic properties of the von Neumann entropy.

4.3 Supplement to Elementary Quantum Vocabulary
37
1. S(ρ) = 0 if and only if ρ is a pure quantum state, i.e., ρ = |ψ⟩⟨ψ|.
2. For a unitary operator U, S(UρU ⋆) = S(ρ).
3. The maximum of entropy is approached on the state ρdisorder = I/N and
S(ρdisorder) = ln N, where N is the dimension of the state space.
It is natural to call ρdisorder = I/N the state of maximal disorder.
4.3.3
Isolated System: Schrödinger and Von Neumann
Equations
For an isolated quantum system, the evolution of its pure state is described by the
Schrödinger equation:
i d
dt ψ(t) = Hψ(t), ψ(0) = ψ.
(4.5)
This equation implies that the pure state ψ(t) evolves unitarily:
ψ(t) = U(t)ψ0,
(4.6)
where
U(t) = e−it H.
(4.7)
The map t →U(t) is one parametric group of unitary operators.
• U(t + s) = U(t)U(s),
• U(−t) = U −1(t),
• U(0) = I.
Since we work with the ﬁnite dimensional Hilbert spaces, the exponent of any linear
operator is determined as the power series eV = ∞
n=0 V n/n! converging in the
operator norm.
In quantum physics, Hamiltonian H is associated with the energy-observable.
However, in quantum-like modeling describing information processing in bio or AI
systems, the operator H has no direct coupling with physical energy. This is the
evolution-generator describing information interactions inside a system. In some
applications H is associated with mental (psychic) energy (Chap. 11).
Schrödinger’s dynamics for a pure state implies that the dynamics of a mixed state
(represented by a density operator) is described by the von Neumann equation:
dρ
dt (t) = −i[H, ρ(t)], ρ(0) = ρ0.
(4.8)

38

What is Life? Open Quantum Systems Approach
Here
ρ(t) = U(t)ρ0U(t)⋆.
(4.9)
This formula implies that, for an isolated system, the von Neumann entropy is pre-
served.
4.4
Open Quantum Systems
An isolated system is an idealization of the real situation; generally all systems
are open, i.e., their interact with surrounding environment. For an open system S,
the dynamics of its state has to be modeled via the interaction with surrounding
environment E. The states of S and E are represented in the Hilbert spaces H and
K. The compound system S + E is represented in the tensor product H ⊗K (for
the notion of tensor product see Sect. 16.9).
This system is treated as an isolated system and in accordance with quantum
theory,the dynamics of its pure state can be described by the Schrödinger equation:
i d
dt (t) = H(t)(t), (0) = 0,
(4.10)
where (t) is the pure state of the system S + E and H is its Hamiltonian.
This equation implies that the pure state (t) evolves unitary : (t) = U(t)0,
where U(t) = e−it H. Here Hamiltonian, the evolution-generator, describing infor-
mation interactions has the form
H = HS + HE + HS,E,
where HS, HE are Hamiltonians of the systems and HS,E is the interaction Hamilto-
nian.
This equation implies that evolution of the density operator R(t) of the system
S + E is described by von Neumann equation (Chap. 4, Sect. 4.3.3):
d R
dt (t) = −i[H, R(t)], R(0) = R0,
(4.11)
However, the state R(t) is too complex: the environment includes too many
degrees of freedom. Therefore, we are interested only the state of S; its dynam-
ics is obtained via tracing of the state of S + E w.r.t. the degrees of freedom of E :
ρ(t) = TrKR(t),
(4.12)
where TrK denotes the partial trace w.r.t. Hilbert space K.

4.5 Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad Equation
39
4.5
Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad Equation
As a rule, the open quantum system dynamics (4.12) is very complex and its math-
ematical analysis is difﬁcult. Its simplest approximation is the quantum Markovian
dynamics given by the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) equation
[209]. This is one of the quantum master equations. (In physics, it is often called the
Lindblad equation.)
dρ
dt (t) = −i[H, ρ(t)] + L[ρ(t)], ρ(0) = ρ0.
(4.13)
Here Hermitian operator (Hamiltonian) H ∈L(H) typically describes the internal
dynamics of system S. In some situations H can also contain counterparts related to
E. But in this book such situations will not be considered. Hence, here Hamiltonian H
generates the internal dynamics of the system S. Superoperator L : L(H) →L(H)
transferringthesetofdensityoperators D(H)intoitselfdescribestheinteractionwith
environment E. In physics L is known as the dissipation operator. This terminology
is justiﬁed by the fact that typically the interaction with the environment leads to
entropy increasing (Sect. 4.7). In other words the order in S decreases. However,
in biological and cognitive applications we are interested in the GKSL-dynamics
which should generate entropy decreasing and order increasing (Chap. 4). Therefore
we shall not use the terminology “dissipation operator” which is common in physics
and call L the interaction operator. If L = 0, no interaction, then GKSL equation
(4.13) is reduced von Neumann equation (4.8) and, for pure states, to Schrödinger
equation (4.5).
The superoperator L can be represented in the form:
Lρ =


γ j

C jρC⋆
j −1
2{C⋆

(4.14)
where operators C j ∈L(H) and, for a pair of operators F1, F2,
{F1, F2} = F1F2 + F2F1,
istheiranticommutator.TheoperatorsC j arecalled“collapseoperators”or“quantum
jump operators” (or Lindblad operators).
Notethatthesolutionρ(t)remainsapositivematrixwithtrace1ifstartedwithsuch
ρ0 (so this general form of dynamics preserves trace in the same way as Schrödinger
dynamics does). The coupling constants γ j ≥0 describe the strength of interaction
between the system S and its environment E. They can be interpreted as inverse
relaxation time (the higher the value of this constant, the faster the extinction of
oscillatory behavior). Generally each jump operator C j describes the special type of
interaction of the system S with the environment E and it is characterized by its own
relaxation time τ j and interaction constant γ j = 1/τ j.

4.5.1
Stabilization to Steady State
Here we continue consideration started in Sect. 2.3. Under some conditions on the
initial state ρ0 = ρ(0) and the interaction between a system S and the environment
E, state evolution t →ρ(t) can lead to a steady state:
lim
t→∞ρ(t) = ρsteady.
(4.15)
In this book, we restrict considerations to the evolution driven by the GKSL equation.
We note that in this case a steady state satisﬁes the stationary GKSL equation:
i[H, ρsteady] = L[ρsteady].
(4.16)
It is also important to point out that generally a steady state of the quantum master
equation is not unique, it depends on the class of initial conditions.
Limiting state ρsteady expresses the stability with respect to the inﬂuence of con-
crete environment E. Of course, in the real world the limit-state would be never
approached. The mathematical formula (4.15) describes the process of stabilization
and damping of ﬂuctuations. But, they would be never disappear completely with
time.
The key aspect of the GKSL equation is that, whereas the standard Schrödinger
equation produces incessant periodic oscillations in all probabilities for all observ-
ables (unless the state is an eigenvector of Hamiltonian H), the GKSL equation
eventually produces stabilization of its solution to a steady state [64]. This state
represents approaching of the stationary regime of reacting to the inﬂuence of the
environment.2 General conditions of existence and uniqueness of steady state are
complicated. Later we shall point to a sufﬁcient conditions.
In this chapter approaching a steady state by a biosystem interacting with the sur-
rounding environment expresses establishing equilibrium in information exchange
between them. In the model of decision-making via decoherence (Sect. 2.3), a steady
state has the meaning of the decision state. In the present chapter, we consider a
more general problem of biosystem’s adaptation to the surrounding environment.
Decision-making via decoherence will be again considered in Sect. 6.7 as a part of
modeling brain’s functioning.

Quantum Markov Dynamics

the Markov property, consider the evolution superoperator Tt : L(H) →L(H),

even Schrödinger dynamics can lead to stabilization [38].

ρ(t) = Ttρ0.
(4.17)
It has the form
Tt = et, where ρ = −i[H, ρ] + L[ρ].
(4.18)
This representation implies that the map t →Tt, [0, +∞) →L(H), is the one
parametric (super)operator semigroup, i.e.,
T0 = I,
Tt1+t2 = Tt2 ◦Tt1, t1, t2 ≥0.
(4.19)
The latter equality represents Markov property:
ρ(t + s) = Tt+sρ0 = Tsρt, for any s ≥0,
(4.20)
to determine system’s state at any instant of time t′ ≥t, it is sufﬁcient to know its
state at time t.
4.6
Camel-Like Dynamics of Quantum Entropy
We stress that the GKSL equation (Sect. 4.5) has been widely applied outside of
quantum physics to a variety of problems in cognition, psychology, decision-making,
and economics [18–21, 24, 25].
We consider the following simple GKSL equation illustrating the basic features
of interaction of a biosystem S with its environment E:
ρ′(t) = −i[H, ρ(t)] + γ(Cρ(t)C⋆−1
2{C⋆C, ρ(t)}).
(4.21)
Here γ is the coupling constant representing the strength of interaction between S and
its environment E. We want to present the model example of the order-stable dynam-
ics that matches the biological order preserving behavior. We select the Hamiltonian
of S and the interaction operator C as follows:
H = σx =

0 1
1 0
 , C =

(In Sect. 4.7, one can ﬁnd a hint why we selected the operators in this way.)
System’s Hamiltonian is the Pauli matrix σx. We select the initial state as the

Fig. 4.1 Order-stable (camel-like) dynamics of the quantum (von Neumann) entropy
The curves in Fig. 4.1 correspond to the values of the coupling constant γ =
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. For γ = 0, the system is isolated and it preserves its entropy (straight
line). The environment E that is described by the interaction operator (Lindbladian
L determined by one operator C) has the strong ordering effect on the system. The
increase of the coupling constant γ implies quicker stabilization and lower entropy
of the steady state.
As we can see from Fig. 4.1, entropy’s dynamics has four stages (so the dynamics
is more complicated than was presented in the introduction to this chapter):
• 1. Increasing and approaching the maximum value: the interaction with a new
environment E and learning its features increases disorder in the system S.
• 2. Decreasing and approaching the minimum value: by using the results of learning
during the ﬁrst stage, S recovers order.
• 3. Slight increasing: the process of further interaction with E can bring a new
portion of disorder into S.
• 4. Stabilizing: S approaches the steady state ρsteady = limt→∞ρ(t).
We call graphs of such shape, Fig. 4.1, camel-like graphs. For small interaction
constant γ (long relaxation time τ = 1/γ) there are two humps, with the second hump
essentially dumped; increase of γ leads to stronger dumping of the second hump and
then to its disappearance; for say γ = 5, the “camel” becomes one humped. The
presence of the second hump and its dependence on γ is a ﬁner characteristics of
dynamics and we shall concentrate on the presence of the ﬁrst (relatively big) hump.
The entropic camel is characterized by the inequality:
max
t
S(ρ(t)) >> S(ρsteady).
(4.24)

4.6 Camel-Like Dynamics of Quantum Entropy
43
For large γ, we have even the inequality:
S(ρ0) > S(ρsteady).
(4.25)
The main distinguishing feature of such dynamics is that its steady state is not charac-
terized by entropy’s maximum value corresponding to the ﬁrst hump of the camel-like
graph (cf., with the typical behavior of a physical system, Sect. 4.7). The entropy of
the steady state can be essentially lower than the entropy approached at the ﬁrst stage
of dynamics - adaptation to the features of the environment E and search for adequate
reaction to it. After this stage, S begins to improve its functioning and to increase
the degree of internal order, consequently the entropy decreases. In Schrödinger’s
terms [406], after the stage of adaptation to the environment’s features the system S
starts to “absorb order” from E (to absorb negative entropy, in Schrödinger’s words).
Illustrative biological examples are presented in Sect. 4.10.
Of course, not any environment would deliver order. A typical quantum physi-
cal environment delivers disorder and generates the dissipation process leading to
entropy’s increase. In such situation, the steady state is characterized by the maxi-
mum of entropy (Sect. 4.7, Fig. 4.2). To be more precise, we have to speak not about
order-stable or disorder-generating environments, but about interactions which gen-
erate order or disorder.
We emphasize that, for the camel-like dynamics, the entropy of the steady state
ρsteady can be essentially lower than the entropy of the initial state ρ0. For very strong
coupling with the environment (graph for γ = 5), the ﬁnal entropy is practically zero.
Hence, adaptation via interaction with E can improve the level of order in S. The
system absorbs from the environment the information useful for internal ordering.
Thus, a special class of open quantum systems exempliﬁed by dynamics (4.21), (4.22)
is a very good candidate for mathematical modeling of order stability in biosystems.
Schrödinger described the aforementioned dynamics with the notion of negative
entropy [406]:
“Every process, event, happening -call it what you will; in a word, everything
that is going on in Nature means an increase of the entropy of the part of the world
where it is going on. Thus a living organism continually increases its entropy - or, as
you may say, produces positive entropy -and thus tends to approach the dangerous
state of maximum entropy, which is of death. It can only keep aloof from it, i.e. alive,
by continually drawing from its environment negative entropy - which is something
very positive as we shall immediately see. What an organism feeds upon is negative
entropy. Or, to put it less paradoxically, the essential thing in metabolism is that
the organism succeeds in freeing itself from all the entropy it cannot help producing
while alive.”
We now discuss applicability of the Markov approximation given by the GKSL
equation to modeling of interaction of a biosystem S with its environment E (see
also article [310]). The basic condition for derivation of the GKSL equation is weak
coupling of S with E (see, e.g., [64, 209]). This condition is very natural in the
biological framework. While any biosystem S is fundamentally open, its coupling

44
4
What is Life? Open Quantum Systems Approach
to the surrounding environment should be weak; otherwise functioning of S can be
destroyed by E. For example, strong interaction with electromagnetic radiation may
cause immediate death. In the same way, intensive absorption of information coming,
e.g., from mass-media and other sources can lead to information overload, to a state
of stress, and even to death. Schrödinger pointed out that isolation mechanisms play
the crucial role in survivability of a biosystem [406]).
4.7
Open Systems Generating Disorder
In this section we describe a typical behavior of quantum physical systems. The
results presented here illustrate how biosystems should not behave, to stay alive. The
unitality of quantum dynamics is discussed as a condition for non-camel graphic
behavior. A quantum channel is called unital if T (I) = I, where I denotes the unit
operator. The dynamics of a typical physical system is characterized by unitality. We
formulate the following simple theorem which is important for our further reasoning.
Thistheoremiswellknown(see,e.g.,[64, 334]);forreader’sconvenience,wepresent
its proof in Appendix A (Sect. A.1).

for all quantum states if and only if T is unital.
□
Consider open quantum systems dynamics and master equation (4.13) for the

where
Tt = et, where ρ = −i[H, ρ] + L[ρ].
(4.27)
Suppose that, for any t ≥0, the dynamical quantum channel Tt is unital, i.e.,
Tt I = I, t ≥0.
(4.28)

S(Tsρ(t)) ≥S(ρ(t)), for any s ≥0.
(4.30)

4.7 Open Systems Generating Disorder
45
Thus, entropy does not decrease at any instant of time t. We recall that we con-
sider ﬁnite dimensional state spaces; in the inﬁnite-dimensional case, the situation is
essentially more complicated [203, 334]. We obtained a kind of the Second Law of
Thermodynamics, but for open (quantum) systems (see paper [334] for more precise
formulation of this law):
If the system’s evolution can be described by unital dynamics, then the von Neu-
mann entropy gain during evolution is nonnegative.
If a quantum dynamics is non-unital, then quantum entropy can decrease and
ﬂuctuate (Sect. 4.6, Fig. 4.1).
Theorem 4.7.2 Dynamical channel Tt is unital, for some time-interval [0, δ], δ >
0, if and only if the unit operator satisﬁes the equation:
LI = 0
(4.31)
Proof (1). Since Tt(I) = I, we have d
dt Tt(I) = 0, and, hence, Tt(I)I = 0. The
dynamical channel is invertible, since Tt = et, where  : L(H) →L(H) is a
bounded linear (super)operator (we consider a ﬁnite dimensional case). Hence,
I = i[H, I] + LI = 0 and (4.31) holds. (2). Now, let (4.31) hold, then I = 0
and Tt I = etI = I.
In fact, we found that unitality on any (in principle, an arbitrary small time-
interval) implies global unitality, on [0, +∞), because condition (4.31) implies the
global unitality.
Proposition 4.7.3 If, for each state, the entropy gain is nonnegative on an arbitrary
small time-interval, then the dynamical channel Tt is unital for all t ∈[0, +∞),
and, hence, the entropy gain is nonnegative on [0, +∞).

Theorem 4.7.2 and Proposition 4.7.3 imply the following form of the the Second

[C, C⋆] = 0.

Thus normality of all operators C j is sufﬁcient for unitality of dynamics and, hence,
the entropy gain is nonnegative (globally). In the simplest case (see Eq. (4.21)), the

sum is reduced to one term, and the condition (4.32) is necessary and sufﬁcient for
unitality and entropy increase. (One can easily check that the operator C in (4.21))
given by (4.22) is not normal.) For example, consider Eq. (4.21) with some Hermitain
interaction operator C, say C = σz (Pauli z-matrix) with the same Hamiltonian and

4.8
Dynamics of Linear Entropy (Decoherence)
As we know, the von Neumann entropy approaches its minimal value, S = 0, for
pure states. This points to a connection between the degrees of purity and order in a
system. How can one deﬁne purity of a quantum state? Pure states are represented
by density operators of the form ρ = |ψ⟩⟨ψ|. As any projector, such a state is an
idempotent operator, i .e., ρ2 = ρ.
Since this projector is one dimensional, Tr ρ = 1. Hence, if a quantum state is
pure, then
P(ρ) ≡Tr ρ2 = 1,
(4.33)
and vice verse. The quantity P(ρ) is called purity of ρ. Purity equals one iff the state
is pure.

4.8 Dynamics of Linear Entropy (Decoherence)
47
Fig. 4.3 Order-stable (camel-like) behavior of the linear entropy (decoherence)
On the basis of purity, one introduces a new sort of entropy, linear entropy (see,
e.g., [468]) given by
SL(ρ) = 1 −P(ρ).
(4.34)
This entropy behaves similarly to the von Neumann entropy:
• 1. SL(ρ) = 0 if and only if ρ is a pure quantum state.
• 2. For a unitary operator U, SL(UρU ⋆) = SL(ρ).
• 3. The maximum of entropy is approached on the state ρdisorder = I/N and
S(ρdisorder) = 1 −1/N, where N is the dimension of the state space.
In particular, the linear entropy of an isolated quantum system is constant.
Open quantum system dynamics can generate camel-like shapes of the linear
entropy, cf. Figs. 4.3 and 4.1 (a camel-like shape) as well Figs. 4.4 and 4.2 (monotonic
increase).
One of its advantages is that it is easier to calculate than the von Neumann entropy
(To calculate the von Neumann entropy, one has to ﬁnd the eigenbasis of ρ and this can
be computationally difﬁcult.) The main distinguishing feature of the linear entropy
is straightforward coupling with purity of the quantum state. This sort of entropy
is also used as a measure of decoherence (see, e.g., [47, 48] for applications for
analysis of experimental data). The latter can be treated as the loss of purity.
For a quantum physical system, typically open system dynamics leads to decoher-
ence, loss of purity; linear entropy approaches one. The basic feature of biosystems is
their ability to beat decoherence and increase states’ purity - the camel-like behavior
of the linear entropy.
For linear entropy we can formulate the analog of Theorem 4.7.4:

Theorem 4.8.1 For GKSL-dynamics, the linear entropy gain during evolution is
nonnegative, iff (equivalent) conditions (4.28), (4.31) hold.
□
For example, consider curves of unital dynamics in Fig. 4.2. Its evolution of the
linear entropy is presented in Fig. 4.4.
4.9
Specialty of Biosystem’s States and Dynamics
It is useful to try to assign some biological meaning to unitality, Tt I = I. In the
N-dimensional case, we can consider the state ρdisorder = I/N. This is the state
of maximal disorder (with respect to the von Neumann and linear entropies),
S(ρdisorder) = ln N and SL(ρdisorder) = 1 −1/N. The unital dynamics is charac-
terized by transformation of the maximal disorder state into itself, i.e., Tt cannot
decrease disorder and generate order of some degree. However, it is not clear whether
a biosystem can be alive in the state of total disorder, ρdisorder. Generally, we consider
the unitality as a condition excluding the possibility of the camel-like dynamics for
all possible states.
The camel-like dynamics of a quantum system represented by the curves in Figs.
4.1 and 4.3 is a good candidate for modeling of living systems. The main problem is
the absence of mathematical formalization of the camel-like behavior. Violation of
the unitality condition implies only that, for some states, entropy has the camel-like
form. But, generally non-unitality does not imply the camel-like dynamics for all
states, as one would like to have for biological systems.

4.9 Specialty of Biosystem’s States and Dynamics
49
This interplay between the form of dynamics and states’ features is a complex
issue, since not only the description of possible interactions with environments
(encoded in the coefﬁcients of the Lindbladian), but even the description of the
class of possible states DS(H) of a biosystem S is a difﬁcult problem. It is natural to
assume that DS(H) is a proper subspace of the space of all density operators D(H).
A similar problem is well known even in quantum physics. Textbooks may claim
that all density operators correspond to physically realizable states, but experts know
that only special quantum states can be prepared experimentally.
The states of our interest are limited to those compatible with life. Denote the
space of such states by the symbol Dlife(H). Subclasses of the states correspond to
thehealth(includingaging)conditionsofthelife.Thedescriptionofthemathematical
structure of the space Dlife is a complex problem. We mention one concrete question:
Is Dlife(H) a convex set? We recall that the set D(H) is convex and this fact has very
importantconsequenceforthebasicprobabilisticfeaturesofthequantuminformation
processing [115, 364]. The environmental states describe the conditions of system’s
environment, but they are manifested only in the L-operator.
In view of the above consideration, maybe attempting to describe a class of dynam-
ics that generate, for all states belonging to D(H), the camel-like behavior of the von
Neumann entropy is not at all a fruitful research strategy. Instead, we can deﬁne for
each GKSL-dynamics the class of states D(H|E) generating the camel-like behav-
ior; so D(H|E) is the union of the all such trajectories of the entropy of S for the
environment E. Then it is natural to suppose that
Dlife(H) ⊂∪ED(H|E),
with union w.r.t. all possible environments supporting alive-states. We remark that
for the unital dynamical systems the set of states Dlife(H) is empty.
We have the following picture of the life-state evolution. Let ρ0 be the initial
state at the moment when S meets new environment E and let ρ0 ∈D(H|E). Then a
camel-like trajectory of the system’s entropy is generated and the steady state ρstead is
approached. If E stable, then S is comfortable in it and the entropy is constant (with
small ﬂuctuations). Let now S meet a new environment E′ (that can be generated, e.g.,
by change of some parameters describing the state of E). Then if ρstead ∈D(H|E′),
then a new camel-like trajectory is generated and so on.
In principle, we can consider a life-evolution trajectory, starting with ρ0 = ρbirth ∈
D(H|Ebirth). A life-trajectory consists of camel-like blocks, and the last block vio-
lates the camel-like structure of entropy: here entropy behaves in accordance with
behavior of physical dissipating systems and entropy grows to the maximal value.

Adaptation to the Environment: Illustrative Examples
Human Adaptation to Surrounding Environment
Suppose that somebody, say, Ivan suddenly ﬁnds himself in an unknown forest; he
shall ﬁnd a possibility to feed himself, adapt to weather conditions, secure his life
from animals and so on. At the ﬁrst stage, he investigates features of the forest-
environment and adapts his behavior to these features: disorder in his information
representation of this context increases. Then he starts to explore the results of adap-
tation and his life becomes more ordered, up to stabilization to a steady state corre-
sponding to this forest-environment (see [19]).
This is an example for discussion of the meaning of the second hump of our
entropy camel. From the curves in Fig. 4.1, we see that with the increase of the
coupling constant the second hump disappears. It seems that it corresponds to the
following situation: a biosystem S has adapted to the environment E and started to
explore the features of E. However, if γ is relatively small, S was not able to adapt to
all basic features of the environment and in the process of exploration, S meets some
new features of E. So, the process of adaptation continues, but on a smaller scale.
This generates the second hump and only then the state’s stabilization. Of course,
there can be many humps with decreasing amplitude.
Cell’s Adaptation to Lactose-Glucose Environment
Another example is the lactose-glucose metabolism in a cell [20]. If the proportion of
glucose-lactose in cell’s environment is changed, e.g., the concentration of glucose
goes down and the concentration of lactose goes up, a cell S should change the
regimeofglucose-lactoseconsumption:atthisstageentropyincreases,since S cannot
immediately update the information on the concentrations. Then when S “becomes
sure” that the glucose concentration became low, it starts to consume lactose and
entropy goes to its minimum value. Then S approaches the steady state corresponding
to lactose consumption.
Epimutations
In contrast to the previous examples, epimutation changes not only bio-information
processing (change in gene expression), but even the physical structure of the cell as,
e.g., promoter methylation and histone modiﬁcations. At the stage of, e.g., promoter
methylation (as the reaction to a new environment) entropy increases, then it goes
down and ﬁnally stabilizes [21].
Neuron Interacting with Electrochemical Environment
This example [284] will be presented in very detail in Chap. 6 starting with quantum
information representation of a single neuron’s state. Of course, a neuron s is a not
an isolated biosystem; it interacts with other neurons via electric signals as well as
with the surrounding chemical environment, including a variety of hormones; denote
this environment by E. Thus we are again in the framework of the theory of open
quantum systems. In our model, by being involved in some cognitive task the neuron

4.10 Adaptation to the Environment: Illustrative Examples
51
s receives signals from E. The entropy of the quantum information state increases.
The neuron is “in doubts” and it tries to adapt its state to the signals coming from
other neurons as well as to the chemical context. After this period of adaptation, s
starts to ﬁre synchronically with other neurons involved in the same cognitive task.
The quantum entropy decreases to its minimum. The electric state of synchronic
ﬁring corresponds to the steady state in the quantum information representation.
In reality, a cognitive task is performed not by a single neuron, but by a neural net-
work. In particular, synchronicity is achieved inside this network. Hence, a biosystem
S is a neural network, its quantum information states are (generally entangled) states
of neurons inside S. Synchronous ﬁring corresponds to a steady state of S.
The second hump of the entropy curves can be generated according to the general
scheme. If S is too weakly connected with other neural networks that are relevant
to performance of the cognitive task, then, after the ﬁrst stage of interaction and
adaptation with E, S can get signals which do not match the previous adaptation.
They generate a new state update and a new hump that is essentially lower than the
ﬁrst one.
This is the good place to mention articles [116–118] on generation of quantum-like
behavior by neural network modeling.

Chapter 5
Order Stability in Complex Biosystems
5.1
Biosystem: Global Order from Local Disorder
This chapter (essentially based on article [303]) is also motivated by Schrödinger’s
book [406] in that he considered one of the most fundamental and intriguing problems
of modern science: “What is life?” (so we continue the study started in Chap. 4). In
this chapter, we model the order stability inside of a complex biosystem S that is
composed of a few subsystems Si, i = 1, 2 . . . , N. We study the following problem
of big complexity:
Can a composed system S = (Si) preserve the “global order” in itself, in spite of
increase of local disorder (i.e., in its subsystems)?
In the mathematical framework, this question is formulated as follows:
Can S = (Si) preserve its entropy while some of its subsystems Si (or even all)
increase their entropies?
We show that within quantum information theory the answer is positive.
The key point is that in quantum theory the state of a compound system is not
reduced to the states of its subsystems. The entropy balance in S is not based on
summation of the entropies generated by subsystems. Here, the signiﬁcant role is
played by entanglement, nonclassical correlations between the states of subsystems
Si of S. In the absence of entanglement, entropy behaves classically: the entropy of
S equals the sum of entropies of Si.
We explore the following feature of quantum channels (dynamical maps describ-
ing the state evolution): they can transfer non-entangled states into entangled. By
using this feature we present the scheme of the concrete quantum channels construc-
tion preserving the global entropy and increasing all local entropies (see Appendix A,
Sect. A.2). The construction is technically quite complicated. We restrict considera-
tions to the case of two subsystems. We start with qubit state spaces of the subsystems
and then consider the general case of N-dimensional state spaces. Our construction
is explicitly based on representation of channels through orthonormal bases in the
subsystems state spaces.

This construction of desired quantum channels is restricted to the unitary evolution
of the S-state. Generalization to non-unitary channels and complex systems with a
large number of subsystems is also possible.
5.2
Compound Classical System: Local and Global Orders
Micro and Macrostates
Suppose that at some instant of time, a system S can be in one of states labeled
by symbols x j, j = 1, 2, . . . , n. We call them microstates of S; set AS = {x j}. Let
ρ be a probability distribution on AS, that is, ρ = (p(x) : x ∈AS), where p(x) ≥
0, 
x p(x) = 1. We call ρ a macrostate, or simply state.
For state ρ, entropy is deﬁned as
S(ρ) = −

p(x)lnp(x).
(5.1)
In bio applications (see Sect. 5.2), this quantity can be interpreted in the following
way. Suppose that microstates of S can be “scanned” by other biosystems. Thus the
microstate dynamics can be treated as signaling to other biosystems. For simplicity,
we consider the discrete time dynamics; it generates the sequence of symbols
X = x(τ1), . . . , x(τN), . . . ,
(5.2)
where τ is the time parameter of the microstate dynamics. Mathematically, this
dynamic (signaling) is modeled as a random process. Under some conditions, the
probability p(x) can be interpreted as the frequency probability - the limiting fre-
quency of occurrence of the symbol x in the process’s trajectory X:
p(x) = lim
N→∞N(x)/N,
where N(x) is the number of occurrences of x in the sequence (5.2) (see [231, 250]
for the frequency interpretation of probability).
If system S is able to preserve its microstate, say one concrete y ∈AS, then
p(y) = 1 and p(x) = 0, x ̸= y, and entropy S = 0. (The microstate can ﬂuctuate
visiting x-states different from y, but not so often, as 0 = lim N(x)/N). In contrast,
if the microstate of system S ﬂuctuates covering uniformly AS, then p(x) = 1/n and
entropy S = ln n. Thus entropy can be used as the measure of state-stability, order
preservation in S. The increase of entropy implies the decrease of information, the
diminishing of order, and death, or at least decay. On the contrary, the decrease of
entropy means the increase of information, the rise of order, and life or at least the
improvement of self-organization.

5.2 Compound Classical System: Local and Global Orders
55
We are interested in compound systems S = (S1, S2). The (statistical) states
of S are represented by probability distributions ρ = (p(x, y)), where p(x, y) ≥
0, 
xy p(x, y) = 1. The entropy of S is given by
S(ρ) = −

xy
p(x, y) ln p(x, y).
(5.3)
For a compound system, the states of its subsystems are given by the marginal
probability distributions:
ρ1 = (p1(x) =

y
p(x, y), ρ2 = (p2(y) =

x
p(x, y)),
(5.4)
and the corresponding entropies are
S(ρ1) = −

x
p1(x) ln p1(x), S(ρ2) = −

j
p2(y) ln p2(y).
(5.5)
We can consider two biosystems, say two cells, that communicate with each other:
S2 “feels” x-states of S1 and vice verse: cell-signaling. Systems Si can represent as
well neural networks in the brain, social systems, or AI-systems [327].
If ρ = ρ1 ⊗ρ2 (the direct product of probability measures), that is, probability
p(x, y) = p1(x)p2(y), then
S(ρ) = S(ρ1) + S(ρ2).
(5.6)
Generally, additivity is violated and only the subadditivity inequality holds
S(ρ) ≤S(ρ1) + S(ρ2).
(5.7)
In the quantum case, the situation is the same. We now point out the speciﬁc
classical constraint between the entropy of a compound system and subsystems’
entropies:
S(ρ) ≥S(ρi).
(5.8)
Quantum information processing relaxes this constraint; in such processing the
global order in a compound biosystem S can be preserved, in spite generating of
local disorders in its subsystems Si.
Consider a model of signaling between biosystems based on recognition not
of microstates, but macrostates. So, S1 and S2 communicate by recognition of the
macrostates of each other (the probability distributions). There are two time scales,
the ﬁne time scale parameter τ and the rough time scale parameter t corresponding to
the micro and macro state dynamics, respectively. The τ-scale dynamics determines
macrostates evolving with the t-scale dynamics.

56

Order Stability in Complex Biosystems
Suppose that state of S evolves in accordance with some dynamics t →ρ(t). It
generates dynamics of subsystems’ states t →ρi(t). Suppose that initially S had
very low entropy, S(ρ0) = ϵ << 1 and suppose that it does not increase (at least
essentially) with time, that is, S(ρ(t)) << 1. Inequalities (5.7), (5.8) trivially imply
inequality:
S(ρ1(t)) + S(ρ2(t)) ≤2S(ρ(t)).
(5.9)
Hence, stability of entropy S(ρ(t)) is possible only under assumption of stability
of the entropy of each subsystem, S(ρi(t)). In other words, preserving of global order
is possible only under the condition of local orders preserving—in all subsystems.
Classical Information Processing in Biosystem
Now consider a complex biosystem containing a large ensemble of identical “ele-
mentary biological subsystems”, say cells; for example, an organism S with N cells;
each of them can be in one of the microstates. Probability p(x) can be interpreted as
the statistical (ensemble) probability p(x) = limN→∞N(x)/N, where N(x) is the
number of cells in the state x. This leads to the statistical interpretation of entropy.
(The ergodicity assumption gives the possibility of identiﬁcation of the frequency
probabilities with the statistical (ensemble) probabilities.)
Let system S = (S1, S2) be a compound biosystem such that each Sj contains a
large number of “elementary biological subsystems”, say cells. Then, at each instance
of time t, the macrostates of S and Sj; ρ(t), ρ j(t), j = 1, 2, can be determined
statistically. The previous considerations on their entropies are applicable even with
the statistical interpretation of probabilities.
We have presented two different schemes for determination and recognitions
of macrostates which are related to two different types of signaling, information
exchange between biosystems, S1 and S2 :
1. frequency (temporal),
2. statistical (ensemble).
In temporal framework, S1 monitors the microstate of S2 during some interval at
the ﬁne time scale τ and after each such time interval updates information about the
macrostate of S2. At the rough time scale t, this update is treated as the instantaneous
change of the macrostate; or in the language of inﬁnitesimals—the state determina-
tion τ-interval t is inﬁnitesimal w.r.t. to the rough scale and, ρi(t + ) is the result
of the update of the state ρi(t).
In the ensemble framework, S1 updates the microstate of S2 via determination of
intensity of realizations of the microstates of S2. Here the probability distribution
p(x) can be interpreted as a ﬁeld, the probability ﬁeld. Of course, determination of
this ﬁeld of probability can neither be done instantaneously. The previous two scale
scheme should be applied.
Generalization of these two interpretation-schemes to the quantum case is
not straightforward.

5.3 Compound Quantum System: Global and Local Orders
57
5.3
Compound Quantum System: Global and Local Orders
We recall the deﬁnition of the von Neumann entropy (Chap. 4):
S(ρ) = −Trρ ln ρ,
(5.10)
where ρ is a density operator. We also recall that exists an orthonormal basis | j⟩
consistingofeigenvectorsofρ,thatis,ρ| j⟩= p j| j⟩(where p j ≥0and
j p j = 1).
In this basis, the matrix of the operator ρ ln ρ has the form diag(pj ln pj; ) hence
S(ρ) = −

j
p j ln p j.
(5.11)
However, the von Neumann entropy has the classical form, but only w.r.t. this to
special basis.
Starting with Formula (5.11), one can try to proceed along the classical inter-
pretational scheme. To consider vectors x j = |e j⟩as microstates a system S, and
the density operator ρ as the macrostate of S : the operator form of representation
of the probability distribution p j = p(x j). However, another density operator has
different basis and different set of microstates. One can try to overcome this problem
by declaring the microstate space as the unit sphere s(H) of Hilbert space H. Then
each “macrostate” given by a density operator determines the probability distribu-
tion on the set of its basis states. One of the problems of such an approach is that, if
some eigenvalues of ρ are degenerate, then the set of microstates is not not uniquely
deﬁned. As the most striking example, take the state ρ = I/N, where N = dim H.
Then any basis in H can be considered as the set of its microstates and this oper-
ator ρ determines inﬁnitely many different probability distributions on s(H). And
some of them are mutually-singular, from measure-theoretic viewpoint. In fact, the
situation is even more indeﬁnite. For a density operator ρ, we can consider general
decompositions of the form:
ρ = −

j
q j|ψ j⟩⟨ψ j|,
(5.12)
where q j ≥0, 
j q j = 1, and (y j = |ψ j⟩) is any set of pure states (pretending to
be microstates). Then the probability distribution q(y j) = q j on the subset (y j) of
sphere s(H) can also be considered as a macrostate represented by operator ρ.
It seems that the classical picture of microstate–macrostate measure-theoretic
interrelation is not applicable (at least straightforwardly) to the quantum case.
For the moment, we proceed with the formal mathematical model in which biosys-
tems’ states are given by density operators. This approach matches perfectly the
genuine quantum biophysics [16] and our study can be considered as justiﬁcation
of order stability in compound quantum biophysical systems, including stability of
mental processing based on the “quantum brain model” in the spirit of papers [66,

58
5
Order Stability in Complex Biosystems
182, 208, 376, 443, 447, 448]. The same can be said about the genuine quantum
artiﬁcial intelligence based on quantum computers and simulators. However, our
desire is to apply the order stability result to quantum-like macroscopic biosystems.
Some steps in this direction were done in works [255, 263, 303]. In the latter, the
quantum-like information processing in the brain is generated via superposition rep-
resentation of action potentials in neurons. This representation can be considered as
qubit digitization of continuous action potentials and linear quantum(-like) dynamics
as linearization of nonlinear classical electrochemical dynamics in neural networks.
In modeling order stability in the quantum-like AI-devices, we can proceed with
the formal mathematical representation of states by density operators which is real-
ized on classical computing devices.
Quantum Compound System and Its Subsystems
Let S = (S1, S2) be a compound system represented in Hilbert space H1 ⊗H2 and
let ρ ∈D (H1 ⊗H2) . The states of its subsystems are calculated as the partial traces
of ρ:
ρ1 = TrH2 ρ, ρ2 = TrH1 ρ,
(5.13)
ρi ∈D (Hi) .
Consider now a pure state of S that is factorisable w.r.t. the tensor product struc-
ture, that is, |⟩= |ψ1⟩⊗|ψ2⟩. States which are not represented in this form are
called entangled. Entangled states play the crucial role in quantum information the-
ory. In particular, this is the most important resource of quantum computations. They
represent the correlations between subsystems of a quantum system. These correla-
tions are nonclassical, in the sense that they cannot be adequately described by the
classical probability, the Kolmogorov measure-theoretic axiomatics.
If the state ρ is factorisable, that is, ρ = ρ1 ⊗ρ2, then
S(ρ) = S(ρ1) + S(ρ2),
(5.14)
cf. (5.6). Generally, as in the classical case (see (5.7)), we have only subadditivity
S(ρ) ≤S(ρ1) + S(ρ2).
(5.15)
However, in contrast to the classical case, it can happen that
S(ρ) < S(ρi),
(5.16)
cf. (5.8). We shall explore this distinguishing feature of the quantum information
measure of disorder.
Consider now the pure state ρ = |⟩⟨|, where |⟩∈H1 ⊗H2. The states of
the systems Si are pure if and only if |⟩is separable. Thus, for an entangled state
ρ, the states ρi are always mixed states.
This fact is important for our further study. It implies that, for an entangled pure
state, the entropies of subsystem’s states S(ρi) > 0, because ρi is not pure.

5.4 Global Order from Local Disorder
59
Quantum Channels for Compound Systems
Consider evolution of the state of the compound system S = (S1, S2), ρ(t) = tρ0
and the corresponding evolution of the states of Si,
ρ1(t) = TrH2tρ0, ρ2(t) = TrH1tρ0.
(5.17)
In the framework of open quantum systems theory, for each t, a state’s evolution
of S is represented by a quantum channel - trace-preserving completely positive map
(superoperator) acting in the space L (H1 ⊗H2) .
Each subsystem Si of the compound system S can be considered as an open
quantum system. In the case of the isolated system S, system S2 plays the role of the
environment of system S1 and vice verse. If S is not isolated, the environment of S1
includes S2 and the environment of ES of S.
5.4
Global Order from Local Disorder
We are interested in the condition of order stability in the quantum(-like) compound
system S in the situation of disorder-increasing in its subsystems Si. Suppose that
initially all entropies were very small S(ρ0), S(ρ0i) << 1. Suppose now that subsys-
tems’ entropies started to increase and in the process of evolution they can increase
essentially. Can S(ρ0) preserve its value (or increase only slightly)?
In this note, we consider the case of factorisable pure initial state of the compound
system S, that is, ρ0 = ρ01 ⊗ρ02.
The simplest model of such behavior is based on the unitary evolution of S, that is,
one parametric group of unitary operators Ut : H1 ⊗H2 →H1 ⊗H2. In this case,
tρ0 = Utρ0U ⋆
t . Such dynamics transfer pure states into pure states. Hence,
S(tρ0) = S(ρ0) = 0. If ρ0 corresponds to a separable pure state, then S(ρ0i) =
0, i = 1, 2, as well.
If the quantum channel t transfers a separable state into an entangled state,
then ρi(t), i = 1, 2, are mixed states and, hence, they have positive entropy. Thus,
our desire is to construct a unitary evolution operator that can transfer separable
states into entangled states. It is well-known that such operators exist and they are
widely used in quantum computations. For readers convenience (and especially by
taking into account that this issue is directed to experts in cognition, psychology, and
decision-making and not in quantum information theory), we present the well-known
examples of such operators for state spaces of an arbitrary (ﬁnite) dimension. These
operators are explicitly expressed through orthonormal bases in Hilbert spaces Hi
and an entropy increase can be calculated explicitly.

Order Stability in Complex Biosystems
5.5
Complex Biosystems
A biosystem S is typically composed of a large number of subsystems Si, i =
1, 2, . . . , M (say genes, proteins, cells, organs, neural networks). Let subsystem Si be
represented in Hilbert space Hi. The compound system S is represented in the tensor
product H = ⊗i=1Hi. For quantum state ρ ∈D (H) , states of the subsystems are
given by partial traces
ρ j = Tr⊗i̸= jHiρ.
Let t be a quantum channel describing the dynamics of the compound state,
ρ(t) = tρ0; then the states of subsystems evolves as
ρ j(t) = Tr⊗i̸= jHitρ0.
For the ﬁxed subsystem Sj, the system S′
j = (Si)i̸= j plays the role of its envi-
ronment (in the case of isolated S). We are interested in generalization of condition
(5.16) for i = 1, 2, . . . , M. However, even in the case M = 2 calculations are long.
We do not want to overshadow the main idea of compound-stability by even longer
calculations. Although calculations for an arbitrary M are more complicated, but it
is clear that desired quantum channels can be constructed, especially for spaces of
the dimension dim H = 2M (M qubit space).
The construction of desired quantum channels is presented in Appendix A
(Sect. A.2).

Concluding Discussion: Order Stability in Bio and AI
Systems
In this chapter we presented a new approach to the problem of order stability in
biosystems formulated by Schrödinger in 1944 [406]. This approach is based on
the quantum-like paradigm realized in the framework of the open quantum systems
theory. The following particular problem was studied:
Preservation of order stability by a biosystem S as a compound of subsystems
performing some biological functions generating disorder-increasing.
We explored the features of quantum information processing, especially the con-
stancy of the entropy of an isolated quantum system and the possibility to generate
entangled states. The quantum-like model is purely informational, that is, biosys-
tems are considered as information processors; for each subsystem Si, the rest of the
compound system S is treated as the information environment. The order stability
has the meaning of stability of information processing in S.
We considered the simplest situation of an isolated compound biosystem S. The
next step is modeling order stability of a compound open system S interacting with

5.6 Concluding Discussion: Order Stability in Bio and AI Systems
61
the information environment ES. Its state dynamics is non-unitary. In such a model,
disorder in the biosystem S is coming both from outside, namely from the information
environment ES, and from inside, that is to say, the subsystems Si of S.
The phenomenon of life is not reduced to order stability. However, even consis-
tent modeling of information exchange stability in a complex biosystem is a step
toward clariﬁcation of this phenomenon. I hope that the modeling presented in this
chapter matches with Schrödinger vision [406] of information processes in biosys-
tems (within a modern quantum information representation).
The result on order stability in the whole system, while order decreases in its
subsystems, is also applicable to social and AI-systems processing information in
accordance with the quantum theory.
We can distinguish two types of AI-systems:
• Systems equipped with genuine quantum information processing devices, say
quantum computers or simulators.
• Systems equipped with classical information processing devices, say classical
digital or analog computers, realizing quantum(-like) information processing.
Personally I do not share the generally high expectation for successful realization
of genuine quantum physical computing project, especially hopes that such quantum
devices can be useful for AI-systems, say robots. I think that quantum information
processing based on classical computational devices has better perspectives. But,
since in science it is always difﬁcult to make prognoses for future development,
both types of AI-systems, genuine quantum and quantum-like, have to be studied.
In future, the output of this paper may become useful for modeling behavior of
collectives composed of quantum and quantum-like robots and other AI-systems.
The main impact of this chapter is in clariﬁcation of order stability in biosystems
as a consequence of quantum(-like) information processing. We hope that this is a
step (of course, a little step) toward clariﬁcation of phenomenon of life.

Psychic Versus Physical Phenomena
The present sharp separation of physics and psychology (and cognitive science) is
only a peculiarity of the present moment. The 19th and the ﬁrst part of 20th century
were characterized by mutual inﬂuence of physical and psychological theories and
the fruitful exchange of ideas between the brightest representatives from both sides.
One of the best known examples is the impact made by psychology on quantum
mechanics which resulted in borrowing the complementarity principle [74] by Niels
Bohr from William James’ book [216]. It may be less known that, in turn, the idea
of complementarity was elaborated by James under the inﬂuence of the 19th century
studies in thermodynamics which led him (as well as later Sigmund Freud [153,
154]) to the notion of psychic energy. Initially, complementarity in psychology was
about complementarity of different representations of consciousness, known as the
dissociative identity disorder. These are analogs of position and momentum represen-
tations in quantum mechanics, wave-particle duality. In one context a physical system
behaves as a wave and in another context as a particle. In the same way a human with
multiple personality disorder can exhibit a few totally different (“incompatible”) per-
sonalities. Reviewing a variety of deﬁnitions from dictionaries and encyclopedias,
we believe that we can safely state the following:
• Physics is the science that deals with the properties of matter (including radiation).
• Psychology is the science that deals with mental processes and behavior.
In accordance with the views of Rene Descartes, there are two basic types of
substance, material and mental, and one is not reduced to the other. Naturally, physics
and psychology are considered as different ﬁelds of science as they can be, each with
its speciﬁc theoretical and experimental methodologies. It seems that there is nothing
or very little in common between them. Most physics students would probably not
like to spend their time studying psychology courses and most psychology students
dislike physics.

However, recent quantum information revolution gives a new chance for coupling
of physics and psychology. In quantum information theory, the genuine physical
structure of carries of information does not play any role. The main mathematical
structures of this theory are superposition, entanglement, and operator representation
of observables. Such structures do not need be coupled with electrons or photons and
generally micro-systems. They can be associated as well with macroscopic random
systems. Superposition represents uncertainty and entanglement represents coupling
of uncertainties in the subsystems of a compound system. In this way one can apply
the methodology and formalism of quantum theory outside of physics, this is the
essence of quantum-like modeling.
The main problem of quantum-like modeling is its shaky neurophysiological
ground. Although the black box model has found numerous applications (as was
pointed out in the previous chapters), one can be curious in coupling between the
quantum information model of processing of mental information by the brain and
the neurophysiological processes in the brain. The ﬁrst steps in this direction were
done in papers [255, 284, 291]. By the latter paper, uncertainty generated by the
action potential of a neuron is represented as quantum-like superposition of the basic
mental states corresponding to a neural code.
Suppose that a neural code can be (classically) described by the variable α =
0, 1, . . . , m −1. Then, it serves as the basis of the quantum-like model; quan-
tumly this code is described by the orthonormal basis (|α⟩)m−1
i=0 . The single-neuron
state space is complex Hilbert space of dimension m, H = Cm. Through this quan-
tum information elevation, the neural coding is expanded - via operation with
superpositions of the basic states. The state of a neural network G composed
of N neurons is presented in the tensor product of single-neuron state spaces,
HG = H ⊗· · · ⊗H = Cm N .
Brain is Not Quantum Computer
The quantum information representation increases exponentially brain’s informa-
tional capacity. Thus, by this model, brain’s information capacity is based not only
on the huge number of neurons and connections between them, but, ﬁrst of all, on the
use of the quantum information representation. Consider the simplest neural code
with α = 0, 1 (the quiescent/ﬁring neural code). Here the state space of single neu-
ron is qubit space. Then a neural network with 100 neurons processes information
in the state space of dimension 2100. Hence, even a neural network composed of a
few neurons has big quantum information capacity. We remark that this is the basic
feature of quantum computing leading to its supremacy over the digital computer
(cf. [304]).
However, we do not claim at all that brain’s functioning can be modeled as a
kind of quantum computing. It seems that decoherence would prevent realization of
standard quantum algorithms. However, in our model [18, 19, 24, 27], decoherence
(the main disaster of quantum computing) plays the positive role which will be
discussed below (Sects. 6.7.1 and 6.8.2). Moreover, the brain is not computer at
all. It is not feed-forward computing device handling solely stimuli coming from
environment (see Sect. 6.9, about coupling of our model with autopoiesis).

Self-measurements on Mental States within Quantum Dynamical Model
In this chapter, we shall work with the notion of brain’s mental function. In the dic-
tionary of American Psychological Association [13], a mental function is deﬁned as
any cognitive process or activity, such as thinking, sensing, or reasoning. In our pre-
sentation, a mental function is any information processor based on the brain’s neural
networks performing any mental task, thinking, sensing, reasoning, or decision-
making.
In quantum-like modeling of brain’s activity, mental functions perform self-
measurements by extracting from quantum information states the answers to ques-
tions, the solutions of problems, thoughts, senses and so on (Sect. 6.5). Outputs of
mental function’s activity are conscious entities.
This extraction is modeled in the framework of theory of open quantum sys-
tems. In this way, it is possible to proceed without appealing to state’s collapse. The
dynamics of the state of mental function F is described by the open quantum system
dynamics. Its steady (stationary) states represent classical statistical mixtures of the
possible outputs of F – the decisions (see also Chap. 1, Sect. 2.3). Thus, through
interaction with the electrochemical environment, the mental function F (considered
as an open system) resolves uncertainty that was originally encoded in superposition
representing the action potentials of neurons.
In this chapter, we start with the canonical model of quantum measurements based
on mathematical realization of observables by Hermitian operators and state update
by the projection postulate [341, 451] (Sect. 6.6). This model leads to the ambiguous
notion of mental state collapse and our aim is to avoid this. For this purpose, we con-
sider realization of measurement in theory of open quantum systems (Sect. 6.7), with
Markovean and non-Markovean quantum dynamical equations. However, straight-
forward application of the later induces its own problems (Sect. 6.7.2).
To resolve these problems, in Sect. 6.8.2 we appeal to the model of “differentia-
tion” [28] by which the state of the mental function F experiences step by step state
transitions under the inﬂuence of the surrounding electrochemical environmental
factors. The output of differentiation is the “decision state” of F, the classical statis-
tical mixture of mental states associated with F. Finally, in our model the concrete
output of F is produced with the aid of a classical random generator incorporated in
“brain’s hardware”.
Differentiation can be considered as a self-observation process. Generally, the
main difference in applications of the quantum formalism to physics and to cogni-
tive science is in the difference between external and internal (self-)observation. In
quantum physics, Bohr emphasized the role of external observer. In theory of cog-
nitive systems, self-observations plays the crucial role, for example, in relation to
the autopoiesis viewpoint to life and cognition (see Maturana and Varela [347]). We
point especially to the autopoiesis approach to social science (see Luhmann [340]).
The latter is closer to our modeling. However, this interesting topic deserves its own
detailed study (see Sect. 6.9 for related discussion).

Ontic and Epistemic Representations: Electrochemical and Quantum
From the philosophical viewpoint, we couple the electrochemical and information
processes in the brain within the ontic-epistemic methodology, see Atmanspacher
[32]. The quantum information description is epistemic. It represents knowledge
which the brain extracts from neurons’ activity. The latter is described by the ontic
counterpart of theory. The main difference from the ontic-epistemic interpretation of
quantum physics [32] is that the brain acts as a “self-observer”. It extracts knowledge
generated by the electrochemical activity of neural cells.
6.2
From Electrochemical Uncertainty in Action Potentials
to Quantum Superposition
The main idea behind our model [284, 291] connecting the electrochemical processes
in the neural networks of the brain with the quantum-like probabilistic structure of
decision-making by humans is that neuron’s states can be mathematically expressed
by normalized vectors of complex Hilbert space similarly to electron’s or photon’s
states. This mathematical formalization reﬂects the basic feature of quantum-like
information processing by neurons:
A single neuron has to ‘work’ with probabilistic superpositions of states caring
cognitive information.
Another crucial point is that a neural cell cannot be considered as an isolated
bio-physical and bio-informational system. Its superposition state is coupled with
the superposition states of the neurons in a neural network performing some task.
A neuron is treated as an open system, which state is affected by information ﬂows
from the electrochemical environment composed of signals (electrical currents, elec-
tromagnetic ﬁeld, neurotransmitters) generated by other neurons.
We recall that the classical information approach to modeling of the brain func-
tioning explores the discrete states of a neuron corresponding to various neural codes
[85]; e.g., 0/1, the quiescent/ﬁring neural code. We stress the role of the states of
uncertainty in information processing, e.g., neither quiescent nor ﬁring. Such states
can be represented as superpositions. Our aim is quantum-like modeling of process-
ing of the uncertainty states leading to quantum-like statistics of outputs of a mental
function F.

6.2 From Electrochemical Uncertainty in Action Potentials to Quantum Superposition
67
Fig. 6.1 Illustration for quantum-like representation of uncertainty generated by neuron’s action
potential (originally published in [284])
We propose to describe uncertainty in generation of an action potential by a
neuron, say N, by using states’ superposition. Consider two dimensional complex
Hilbert space H (qubit space). Quantum information states are connected to the stan-
dard neural codes, for example, the “excited-quiet” code; see Fig. 6.1 for illustration
of the quantum information representation of uncertainty generated by the neuron’s
action potential. Quantum information representation in the form of superposition
does not mean simultaneous coexistence of excited and quiet neural states realized
by some sort of quantum magic; rather, it accounts for a potential of transferring
to new cognitive eigenstates in the case of some particular change of the cognitive
basis.
Here we make a short remark about terminology. The standard neural code is
based on non-ﬁring/ﬁring states. We make the non-ﬁring state more detailed. The
quiescent state is still encoded by 0 and understood as the state of inactivity, i.e.,
the refractory state. However, besides of ﬁring and quiescent states, a neuron can
be in a state of uncertainty characterized by the range of values of the membrane
potential, V ∈[−70, −55] (see Fig. 6.1). In this state a neuron can generate an action
potential with some probability. Uncertainty in generation of action potentials is a
consequence of stochastic operation of ion channels. We also point to random failure
of generation, conduction, and acceptance of action potentials (by other neurons)
[130, 228].

Brain Functioning
At a concrete instant of time neuron’s state can be mathematically described by a
superposition of two states, quiescent and ﬁring, labeled by |0⟩, |1⟩:
|ψ⟩= c0|0⟩+ c1|1⟩, |c0|2 + |c1|2 = 1.
(6.1)
It is assumed that these states are orthogonal and normalized, i.e., ⟨0|1⟩= 0 and
⟨α|α⟩= 1, α = 0, 1. Here the coordinates c0 and c1 with respect to the quiescent-
ﬁring basis are complex amplitudes representing potentialities for a neuron to be
quiescent or ﬁring. Probabilistically these potentialities are expressed by the Born
rule of quantum theory (Sect. 2.1):
pα = |cα|2 = |⟨ψ|α⟩|2.
(6.2)
These probabilities can be interpreted statistically. Let |ψ⟩be a steady state (with
respect to the dynamics realizing a mental function, see Sect. 6.5). Consider a single
neuron N and a sufﬁciently long time interval
T = M, M >> 1,
and ﬁnd the frequency
νM(1) = nM(1)/M,
where nM(1) is the number of -intervals such that neuron N produces a spike.
(Here  is a parameter of our model.) Then
p1 ≈νM(1).
We repeat that steady states play the exceptional role in our model as decision
states (see Chaps. 1, 4 and Sects. 6.7.1, 6.8.2 of this chapter as well as works [18,
19, 24, 26, 27, 284, 291]). But, typically steady states are not pure, these are mixed
states represented by density operators.
In modeling the process of decision-making by the brain, we proceed with the
frequency approach to probability. (In CP this approach, i.e., coupling probability
with the frequency of occurrences, is based on the law of large numbers.)
We note that observer can count spikes and operate with the frequency probability.
However, immediately the following question arises:
Who is an observer?
In our model the brain (more concretely, each mental function) is a system that
is able to perform self-observations, detection of information states of neurons and
neural networks (but not electrochemical states).
Consider now a group of neurons G (say m neurons) connected into a neural
network. Quantum information state space of G is given by the tensor product of
the state spaces for individual neurons. If the neurons do not interact the G-state is
factorized into the tensor product of the states of individual neurons,

69
|ψ⟩G = |ψ1⟩⊗· · · ⊗|ψm⟩≡|ψ1 . . . ψm⟩.
(6.3)
If the neurons interact and these interactions generate correlations, their state is
given by a non-factorisable vector belonging to HG, an entangled state, e.g., for two
neurons,
|ψ⟩G = (|00⟩+ |11⟩)/
√
2.
(6.4)
This state is generated by a pair of neurons ﬁring synchronically. The coefﬁcient
1/

2 gives the amplitude of probabilities p(00) = p(11) = 1/2 (hence, for a sufﬁ-
ciently long time interval T, the proportion of the periods of synchronized ﬁring and
relaxation). Consider also the state
|ψ⟩G = (|01⟩+ |10⟩)/
√
2.
(6.5)
In this state the neurons ﬁre in anti-phase, if N1 ﬁres, then N2 does not and vice
verse.
Generally,entangledstatesgivethequantuminformationrepresentationofperfect
correlations (see [55]). So, we do not associate any sort of quantum magic with
entangledstates.Sinceentangledstatesplaysoimportantroleinquantuminformation
theory, we can speculate that approaching of the perfect correlations between neurons
or groups of neurons also plays the important role brain’s functioning; if our quantum
information model has some degree of adequacy with real information processing in
the brain. In this model, pure states are typically used as the initial states for mental
functions starting the process of decision-making. Say, an electromagnetic external
signal (e.g., coming from a visual image) generates action potentials of neurons
which are quantum informationally represented as superpositions. The latter are
either correlated or anti-correlated via frequencies of ﬁrings. This state of neurons is
represented as an entangled state.
Consider observables a = ±1 given by the operators A such that Ai|0⟩=
−|0⟩, Ai|1⟩= |1⟩. Consider now observables ai on the state spaces of two neu-
rons given by the operators A1 = A ⊗I and A2 = I ⊗A. Their correlation has the
form
⟨A1 A2⟩ψ ≡⟨A1A2ψ|ψ⟩= ⟨A ⊗Aψ|ψ⟩.
(6.6)
For state (6.4), ⟨A1A2⟩ψ = 1; for state (6.5), ⟨A1A2⟩ψ = −1. So, these states
correspond to the perfect correlations.
Now consider a factorisable state, say
|ψ⟩G = 1
2(|0⟩+ |1⟩) ⊗(|0⟩+ |1⟩) = 1
2(|00⟩+ |01⟩+ |10⟩+ |11⟩).
(6.7)
This state represents functioning of a network of two neurons such that all possible
combinations of ﬁring and relaxation are equally possible. There are no correlations
in the ﬁrings of N1 and N2.

70

Brain Functioning
In quantum information representation, correlations in neuronal networks are
mathematically described by entangled states. For example, for a neural network
composed of m neurons, the synchronized ﬁring can generate an entangled state of
the form:
|ψ⟩G = c0|00 . . . 0⟩+ c1|11 . . . 1⟩,
(6.8)
where |c0|2 + |c1|2 = 1. These coefﬁcients give the complex amplitudes of proba-
bilities p(00 . . . 0) = |c0|2, p(11 . . . 1) = |c1|2 (hence, for a sufﬁciently long time
interval T, the proportion of periods of synchronized ﬁring and relaxation). Syn-
chronized ﬁring of neurons performing realization of some mental function seems
to be the easiest way to generate correlations at the level of quantum information
representation via entangled states of the form (6.8).
We stress that entangled states generated by (anti-)synchronized neuronal ﬁrings
are the important mental computational resource.
We also remark that the states considered above, (6.4), (6.5), are symmetric:
neurons’ permutations do not change them. They belong to the symmetric subspace
Hsym
G
of the state space HG. Neurons in such states are indistinguishable. The latter
seems to play the important role in computational stability. The question whether
the quantum-like model of brains functioning should be based on symmetric state
space Hsym
G
(reﬂecting indistinguishability of neurons) or on the complete quantum
information state space HG is complex. We speculate that some mental functions
use indistinguishability of neurons and they process states belonging to Hsym
G
; others
work in HG (see also [284, 291]).
6.3
Electrochemical and Quantum Information States:
Nonlinear Versus Linear Dynamics
The Hodgkin–Huxley equation [206] is the ordinary differential equation describing
the dynamics of the action potential of a neuron. This dynamics is nonlinear. Non-
linearity is crucial to represent non-periodic (chaotic) pattern of activation appearing
at some physical conditions (see, for example, [4, 5, 207]. (Nonlinearity is a nec-
essary condition of chaos [427].) However, although the chaotic patterns are typical
for electrochemical processes in the brain, they are not characteristic for cognitive
processes. Chaotic behavior is never detected at the cognition level (at least for
psychically healthy people).
Rather, as pointed out in our model, the frequency of activations in a long interval
T seems to be truly important to capture cognition process. The quantity of frequency
is determined regardless of chaotic or periodic behavior at the electrochemical level.
Corresponding to the frequency probability, the superposition state can be assigned
for a neuron. Generally, this is the superposition (6.1). Mathematically such states
can be described by the quantum mechanical formalism based on the complex linear
space representation. Quantum dynamics is linear. Thus, transforming the electro-

chemical states to the quantum information states (superpositions) the brain transfers
the nonlinear dynamics of the Hodgkin–Huxley type into the linear quantum dynam-
ics. The quantum-like representation is free form chaotic patterns characteristic for
underlyning electrochemical representation. Thus, elimination of chaotic patters is
a principal feature of quantum information representation of the electrochemical
dynamics of the action potentials of neurons.
6.4
Quantum Physics of Brain’s Functioning: Impossibility
of Superposition of Neuron’s States
This is the good place to make a few remarks on models reducing cognition and
even consciousness to genuine quantum physical processes in the brain (e.g., [182,
376, 393, 443], see also [66, 67, 208, 397, 447, 448]). These attempts are rooted in
the strong belief that the quantum theory is the ultimate physical theory. Supporters
of the ultimate character of quantum theory assume that all processes in nature
can be reduced to quantum physical processes. In particular, brain’s functioning
and its “products”, cognition and consciousness, are generated by quantum physical
processes in the brain. We point to the three main streams in the quantum brain
project:
1. Quantum Mechanics: consciousness from entanglement in microtubules
(Hameroff [182]).
2. Quantum Field Theory: consciousness as the states of the quantum ﬁeld generated
by the brain (started by Umezawa [443], see also [393], and nowadays this QFT-
brain model is actively developed by Vitiello [397, 447, 448]).
3. Quantum Gravity: consciousness as the chain of collapses of superpositions of
masses in the brain (Penrose [376])
These streams have their own advantages and disadvantages. We are not interested in
the physical problems related to the quantum brain approach. For us it is crucial that
all quantum brain models suffer of the impossibility to couple them to the paradigm
of the neuronal processing of cognitive information. The neurons are not the basic
entities of these models, but just some supplementary physical structures. And this
attitude to diminish the role of neurons in cognition has the clear explanation.
All authors developing the genuine quantum physical models of brain’s function-
ing pointed to the impossibility of considering neurons in a state of superposition.
For example, Ricciardi and Umezawa [393] said:
We do not intend to consider necessarily the neurons as the fundamental units of the brain.
Similar statements can be found in the works of Penrose [376], Hameroff [182],
Vitiello [397, 447, 448], and Bernroider [67]. As a consequence, in such models
neurons are not considered as the basic units of information processing. And this

72

Brain Functioning
viewpoint on neurons’ role diminished the interest of the experts in neurophysiology
and cognitive science to the quantum brain models.
In contrast to quantum physical brain models, we present a natural electrochemical
basis for superposition states of a neuron or a group of neurons - in the latter case,
states are generally non-separable - entangled.
We stress that genuine quantum physical models of brain’s functioning also appeal
to superposition of states. However, in contrast to our quantum-like model, the latter
is the superposition of quantum physical states, not the superposition of information
states. The electrochemical processes in neural networks generating quantum poten-
tials of neurons are macroscopic and globally described by classical physics, but, of
course, at the molecular level the quantum physics also plays the important role.
6.5
Mental Function as Decoherence Machine
This section is based on Sect. 2.3 on decoherence decision-making.
In accordance with the previous consideration, a neural network G generates
quantum-like states, linear superpositions of the basic states (|α⟩) corresponding to
the neural code used by G. Here α = (α1, . . . , αN), α j = 0, . . . , m −1, where N is
the number of neurons in G and m gives the number of symbols in this neural code.
Hence, |α⟩= |α1 . . . αn⟩. Denote this state space by the symbol HG.
Consider a mental function F that is physically based on the neural network G.
We suppose that F has discrete outputs ( f j) (possible “decisions”). Mathematically
a mental function F based on G is represented by some orthonormal basis (|γ ⟩) in
HG. These are basic mental states associated with this mental function.
We emphasize that the basis (|γ ⟩) does not need to coincide with the basis (|α⟩)
corresponding to the neural code used by the mental function F. Various mental
functions can use the same neural code (may be they all use the same code) and a
few mental functions can be physically based on the same neural network, but be
represented by different bases (|γ ⟩≡|γF⟩).
For example, consider the quiescent-ﬁring neural code, i.e., m = 2, and G con-
sisting of a single neuron, the neural basis is written as |0⟩, |1⟩. For example, F can
be determined by the basis
|γ ⟩1 = (|0⟩+ |1⟩)/
√
2, |γ ⟩2 = (|0⟩−|1⟩)/
√
2.
Consider now F which is physically based on G consisting of two neurons; let F
use the dichotomous neural code, i.e., the α-basis has the form:
|00⟩, |10⟩, |01⟩, |11⟩,
For example, F can be determined by the Bell basis
|γ ⟩1 = (|00⟩+ |11⟩)/
√
2, |γ ⟩2 = (|00⟩−|11⟩)/
√

Each basis vector |γ ⟩corresponds to some value f of F. However, generally this
correspondence does not need be one-to-one: a few basis vectors can correspond to
the same value f of mental function F. In the simplest case, F has only two outputs,
f = ±1 (decisions “yes”/“no”). Thus HG = H−;G ⊕H+;G, where the subspaces
are generated by the vectors corresponding to outputs f = ±1. Generally
H = ⊕f H f ;G.
Suppose that, as in the above example, F is determined by the Bell basis and sub-
spaces H±;G are generated by vectors, |γ ⟩1, |γ ⟩2 and |γ ⟩3, |γ ⟩4, respectively. Then,
F generates the outputs F = ±1 for, respectively, correlated and anti-correlated
states. Generally a state contains both correlated and anti-correlated components.
Let |ψ⟩0 be the initial mental state, superposition of the neural code basis states,
|ψ⟩0 =

α
cα |α⟩,

α
|cα|2 = 1.
(6.9)
This representation is of the electrochemical origin, but of the quantum information
nature.
By our mathematical model of decoherence decision-making (Sect. 2.3), the men-
tal function F works to transfer this superposition into a density operator ρF that is
diagonal with respect to the F-basis, i.e.,
ρF =

γ
pγ |γ ⟩⟨γ |,
(6.10)
where pγ ≥0, 
γ pγ = Tr ρF = 1. In quantum physics, this transition is known
as decoherence. So, in our model [18, 19, 24, 27] a mental function generates its
outputs via decoherence of the initial mental state which is typically assumed to
be a pure state. We recall that decoherence process diminish states quantumness.
Quantitatively the latter can be expressed through state’s purity (Sect. 4.8).
In terms of density operators, F generates transformation
ρ0 ≡|ψ⟩0⟨ψ|0 →ρF.
(6.11)
This output state can be considered as a classical state - classical with respect to
mental function F (the basis (|γ ⟩)). The ρF is the classical statistical mixture of
pure states (|γ ⟩) with probabilistic weights pγ . Thus, in our model a mental function
resolves uncertainty presented in the initial mental state |ψ⟩0 by “differentiating”
it (see Sect. 6.8.2) into weighted mixture of states (|γ ⟩) associated with F. The
probabilities of F-outputs are obtained by summation of probabilities

p f =

|γ ⟩∈H f ;G
pγ .
(6.12)
The ﬁnal step of F-functioning, selection of the concrete output f, can be based
on a classical random generator with the probability distribution (p f ). Another
possibility is that F selects the output f corresponding to the maximal probability p f .
A mental function F can be considered as a self-observable. In coming sections
we present a few quantum measurement models for the process of resolution of initial
uncertainty encoded in mental state |ψ⟩0, i.e., for transition (6.11).
Ontic and Epistemic Theories
We remark that the outputs of a mental function F are determined by subspaces
H f ;G : F = f for |ψ⟩∈H f ;G (with probability one). In the operator terms, F is
described by projections (Q f ) on the subspaces (H f ;G). If F-outputs are encoded
by real numbers, then these projections compose the Hermitian operator denoted by
the same symbol F,
F =

f
f Q f ,
(6.13)
The mental function F can be identiﬁed with this operator (Sect. 6.6).1 In this for-
malism decomposition of projections Q f into one dimensional projections corre-
sponding to the basis (|γ ⟩),
Q f =

|γ ⟩∈H f ;G
|γ ⟩⟨γ |,
(6.14)
does not play any role; it is hidden even from F which cannot approach its own
internal structure; a mental function self-observes only the outputs F = f.
The following part of this section is devoted to the discussion on the ontic-
epistemic structure of functioning of a mental function. This discussion is merely of
philosophical and methodological value and the reader who is not interested in such
issues can jump to the next sections.
We point out that, in contrast to the von Neumann based scheme, the special
scheme of decision-making by decoherence, so- called differentiation (Sect. 6.8), is
based on the use of the basis (|γ ⟩). This basis determines the hidden structure of F
which is not visible for F by itself, for F as a self-observer. We can interpret vectors
(|γ ⟩) as hidden variables and the description of functioning of F in terms of these
vectors as ontic. The description of F in terms of projections (or operator (6.13)) can
be interpreted as empistemic, it is about knowledge which F extracts from (quantum
information) states of the neural network G.
1 In principle, there is no need to label the F-outputs by real numbers. They can be symbols of any
origin. Hence, the mental function F can be mathematically viewed as PVM, F = (Q f ).

6.6 Model 1: Collapse of Mental Wave
75
We emphasize that both these descriptions are quantum. This is interesting, since
typically the quantum description is epistemic and the ontic one is classical (see
Atmanspacher [32], Khrennikov [255]).
Moreover, we should not forget about the primary level of onticity given by action
potentials, onticity of the electrochemical processes in the brain (and generally in
human’s body). The γ -basis description is epistemic w.r.t. the electrochemical one.
Thus, our framework has the multilevel ontic-epistemic structure. Each lower level
is treated as ontic w.r.t. the next higher level which in turn is treated as ontic for the
next higher level.
To call the γ -description epistemic, we should point out to some observer who
“sees” the γ -structure of the (quantum information) states of G. Who is it?
A mental function F operates (as an observer) in the conscious domain of brain’s
mental processing. We can speculate that γ -representation corresponds to operation
in the unconscious domain. Transformation of action potentials into the neural code
basis (|α⟩) and then into (|γ ⟩)-basis happens without coupling to consciousness.
And the process of state differentiation (Sect. 6.8) w.r.t. (|γ ⟩)-basis also happens
unconsciously. We can imagine that each F (treated as a self-observer) is based on
an unconscious quantum processing device described as a quantum channel (Chap. 4,
Sect. 4.7). And the latter is determined by the γ -basis.
As is typical in ontic-epistemic structuring of scientiﬁc theories, the same epis-
temic model may have a few different ontic models beyond it. In the above quantum
ontic-epistemic framework, the selections of different bases in subspaces H f ;G corre-
spond to the use of different hidden variables (ontic structures). As we shall see, these
structures correspond to the different signatures of the environments (Sect. 6.8.1) of
the neural network G – the neural basis of F = FG.
6.6
Model 1: Collapse of Mental Wave
We start with the presentation of the canonical quantum model for transition (6.11).
It is convenient to proceed with the initial state given by an arbitrary density operator
ρ0. In this model a mental function F is represented by the Hermitian operator (6.13).
The value f is observed with probability given by the Born rule (Sect. 2.1):
p f = Trρ0Q f
(6.15)
and the post-observation state with speciﬁed value f is given by
ρ f =
Q f ρ0 Q f
TrQ f ρ0 Q f
(6.16)
and without output speciﬁcation by the state

Brain Functioning
ρF =

p f ρ f .
(6.17)
In particular, for pure initial state |ψ⟩0 (the density operator ρ0 = |ψ0⟩⟨ψ0|), the
post-measurement state is again the pure state:
|ψ f ⟩= Q f |ψ0⟩/∥Q f |ψ0⟩∥.
(6.18)
This is the projection postulate [341, 451].
This mathematical model leads to jump-like state transformation, |ψ0⟩→|ψ f ⟩;
this transformation is often called “wave function collapse.” A plenty of quantum
(-like) models of cognition refer to “mental state collapse” [66, 67, 182, 208, 376].
However, even in genuine quantum physics the notion of wave function collapse
(and generally appealing to the projection postulate [341, 451]) is the most doubtful
notion of quantum theory. Its straightforward use in modeling of cognition mystiﬁes
brain’s functioning.
6.7
Model 2: Open Quantum System Dynamics
In modeling of brain’s functioning, our aim is to proceed without mental state col-
lapse, without referring to the projection postulate. Here we appeal to theory of open
quantum systems and corresponding treatment of the measurement process [115,
209, 367]. In this theory, observation (measurement) on a system S is considered as
interaction of S with its environment E. System’s state dynamics generated by this
interaction is described by the quantum dynamical equation (Sects. 2.3 and 4.4).
Here we brieﬂy repeat the basics of quantum Markovean modeling of the state
dynamics of a system interacting with the surrounding environment.
Under the assumption that quantum state dynamics is Markovean, the quantum
dynamical equation is the analog of the classical master equation for probabilities.
This is the GKSL equation,
dρ
dt (t) = −[H, ρ(t)] + Lρ(t), ρ(0) = ρ0,
(6.19)
where H is Hamiltonian of S and L is a super-operator. Commonly operator H repre-
sents the state dynamics in the absence of outer environment; L describes interaction
with the environment (Chap. 4). For “natural” systems, environments, and interac-
tions (encoded in operators H and L) the state ρ(t) asymptotically approaches some
steady state ρF,
ρF = lim
t→∞ρ(t),
(6.20)
this is a solution of the stationary equation

6.7 Model 2: Open Quantum System Dynamics
77
[H, ρF] = LρF.
(6.21)
This state is considered as the post-measurement state, but without determination of
the concrete output.
In our model of quantum dynamical (decoherence) decision-making (Sect. 2.3),
the state ρF should be diagonal with respect to the F-basis (|γ ⟩). Thus, it has the
form (6.10)
ρF =

γ
pγ |γ ⟩⟨γ |.
(6.22)
Probabilities p f are determined via summation, see (6.12). In this scheme which
is based on the quantum master equation, the constraint of diagonalization in the
(|γ ⟩)-basis looks as ad hoc.2 The determining role of (|γ ⟩)-basis becomes clear in
the differentiation scheme (Sect. 6.8).
The role of system S is played by neural network G (that can be reduced even to a
single neuron) and E is its electrochemical environment, including the electrical and
chemical signals from other brain’s networks, working with other mental functions,
as well as from other body’s parts.
6.7.1
General Quantum Dynamics of Mental State
For a mental function F, a system in our case neural network G and environment
E, are uniﬁed in a compound quantum(-like) system, (S, E). Its state space is math-
ematically represented as the tensor product of state spaces of subsystems, i.e., as
H = HG ⊗KE. For a mental function F, the state dynamics of the compound system
is described by the Schrödinger equation,
i d
dt = HF|⟩(t), |⟩(0) = |⟩0,
(6.23)
i.e., |⟩(t) evolves unitary, |⟩(t) = UF(t)|⟩0, where UF(t) is one parametric
group of unitary operators, UF(t) : H →H.
The state of ρ(t) of the neural network G (its quantum information state) is
obtained via averaging the state R(t) = |(t)⟩⟨(t)| of the compound system with
respect to the degrees of freedom of environment E:
ρ(t) = TrKR(t).
(6.24)
2 Coupling of this basis with the coefﬁcients of the equation is not straightforward. In applications,
we typically start with an equation and then by ﬁnding its steady state we associate its eigenbasis
with some mental function F. If ρF depends on ρ0, then the situation is even more complex.

78

Brain Functioning
This is the general quantum dynamical equation; the GKSL equation is derived as its
approximation under some conditions [209]. The mental analogs of these conditions
and analysis of their applicability to cognitive system were presented in article [310].
We remark that the partial trace is again a pure state only for factorisable states
of a compound system, i.e., generally it is a mixed state represented by a density
operator. And this dynamics can be non-Markov with the memory effects. In fact,
the real dynamics is surely non-Markovean, but consideration of non-Markovean
quantum dynamics makes the model essentially more complicated; in particular
w.r.t. the problem of existence of steady states.
As in the Markovean case, the outputs of F (decisions) are generated via approach-
ing of a steady state, see (6.20), that is diagonal in the F-basis (|γ ⟩) : ρF =

γ pγ |γ ⟩⟨γ |. This state, or more precisely, this decomposition of the density oper-
ator, is the classical statistical mixture of the basic mental states determining the
mental function. The probabilities of F-outputs are given by (6.12).
Finally, we make a remark on the limit-procedure (6.20) (see also Chap. 5). Of
course, to approach the decision state ρF, the network works only a ﬁnite period of
time - until state’s ﬂuctuations become small with respect to stabilization parameter
ϵ > 0. This parameter is one of characteristics of the mental function ϵ ≡ϵF; in
principle, the model can be more complicated with ϵ depending on the initial state.
This ϵ determines the degree of ﬂuctuations. The clearer picture corresponds to the
discrete dynamics which can be obtained via time-discretization of the quantum
dynamical equation (6.24). Here the state evolution is given by the sequence of
density operators, ρ(t0) = ρ0, . . . , ρ(tn), . . . where tn+1 = tn + δ and δ > 0 is the
step of discretization. Then the approximate decision state is determined by the
condition
||ρ(tn) −ρ(tn−1)|| ≤ϵ.
(6.25)
We note that in this book we proceed in the ﬁnite dimensional case and the choice
of the concrete norm on the space operators does not play any role. In the inﬁnite
dimensional case, one can use either sup or Tr norm.
In Sect. 6.5 the following difﬁcult question has been brieﬂy discussed:
How does F select the concrete value F = f on the basis of the steady state ρF?
For the moment, one can only speculate on this issue. I speculate in the following
way. The state ρF is the classical statistical mixture of the mental states (|γ ⟩) deter-
mining the quantum information representation of self-observable F. Thus, in the
process of approaching ρF quantumness was washed out from the state. In physical
terms, this is the process of decoherence w.r.t. the concrete basis (|γ ⟩). It seems that
the selection of the concrete value f from this statistical mixture can be described
in purely classical probabilistic terms, as, e.g., a random generator producing the
outputs F = f with probabilities p f given by (6.12). As was mentioned in Sect. 6.5,
one can refer to other models of the decision-making on the basis of a classical
probability measure.

6.7.2
Critical Analysis of Open Quantum System Approach
to Cognition
Appealing to the theory of open quantum systems and the use of the quantum dynam-
ical equation (see (6.24) and its Markovean version (6.19)) provide the possibility to
proceed without “mental state collapse”, as resulting from decision-making. How-
ever, this measurement scheme is too abstract. We do not take into account the internal
structure of the process of “differentiation” of the initial state into mixture of F-basic
states (|γ ⟩).
We also point that stabilization to steady state ρF deforms probabilities encoded
in the initial state ρ0. Generally the output probability pγ = ⟨γ |ρF|γ ⟩is not equal
to the input probability p0γ = ⟨γ |ρ0|γ ⟩. Consequently, even the probabilities for the
outputs of mental function F can be modiﬁed; generally
p0 f =

|γ ⟩∈H f ;G
p0,γ ̸= p f =

|γ ⟩∈H f ;G
pγ .
(6.26)
Tobemoreconcrete,considerapureinitialstateρ0 = |ψ0⟩⟨ψ0|.Thisstateencodes
potentiality of realization of state |γ ⟩with the probability p0γ = |⟨ψ0|γ ⟩|2. These
potentialities correspond to electrochemical uncertainty generated by action poten-
tials of neurons. It would be natural to expect that these potentialities would coincide
with potentialities encoded in the output state ρF that are given by probabilities
pγ . However, generally pγ ̸= |⟨ψ0|γ ⟩|2. Roughly speaking the stabilization scheme
based on the quantum dynamical equation is too general, it generates too wide class
of the output distributions. One can desire a quantum measurement scheme without
the projection postulate and with preservation of the probabilities. Such a scheme
will be presented in the next section.
We remark that the canonical quantum measurement scheme based on the pro-
jection postulate [341, 451] (Sect. 6.6) reproduces the probability distribution of
F-outputs (p f ) encoded in the initial state ρ0, see (6.15):
p f = Trρ0Q f =

|γ ⟩∈H f ;G
p0γ .
(6.27)
However, the projection postulate scheme [341, 451] suffers of the collapse-like
state-transition. We want to open the “collapse back box” and to preserve proba-
bility distribution. We also repeat that the projection scheme does not describe the
internal structure of projectors Q f , coupling to the collection of mental states (|γ ⟩)
determining the mental function.

Model 3: Differentiation of Mental State
In this section we follow the article [28] in which the general quantum dynamical
scheme was concreted based on the interpretation of a density operator as a signature
of the environment surrounding system S.
6.8.1
Signatures of Environments in a Density Operator
A density operator is commonly interpreted as a mixed state: statistical mixture of
pure states. However, this interpretation is really inconsistent: density operator ρ
permits different decompositions into mixtures, statistical ensembles of pure states
(|πi⟩):
ρ =

qi|πi⟩⟨πi|, where qi ≥0,

i
qi = 1.
(6.28)
Theory of open quantum systems matches well with the following interpretation of
states given by density operators.
By the Naimark’s dilation theorem, the density operator ρ representing the state
of system S can be generated as a partial trace of a pure state of the compound sys-
tem (S, E). By this interpretation it is meaningless to interpret ρ intrinsically, i.e.,
without coupling to environment E. Different decompositions of ρ into the statistical
mixtures of pure states correspond to variety of the interactions and environments.
According to D’Ariano [110], only a pure state of system S is informationally com-
plete. A state given by a density operator that does not correspond to a pure state
of S is informationally incomplete: it carries the impact of environment E; different
environments can generate the same ρ-state.
In this book (Sect. 6.8.2), we consider the most simple case of orthogonal states
determining a mental function. And in this case the difference between considering
the operator (the left-hand side of (6.28)) and the decomposition into one dimensional
projections (in the right-hand side of of (6.28))) is essentially washed out’.
In fact, we are interested not in the density operator, but in its concrete decom-
position and the corresponding classical probability distribution (qi)). In [28], the
general differentiation scheme was elaborated for non-orthogonal decompositions.
In this case, different decompositions correspond to the signatures of different envi-
ronments. They all are encoded in the same operator and they are invisible in the
standard operator representation of a quantum state. In the formalism of article [28],
quantum states are given not by operators, but by families of one dimensional pro-
jectors and probabilities (|πi⟩⟨πi| , qi), where generally ⟨πi|π j⟩̸= 0, for i ̸= j.

Mathematical Scheme of Differentiation Process
Wenowpresentthemodelofdifferentiation[28]bywhichasystemSexperiencesstep
by step state transitions under the inﬂuence of environmental factors. This approach
can be used for modeling various natural and mental phenomena: cell’s differenti-
ation, evolution of biological populations, decision-making. In this book, we apply
the state-differentiation scheme to model generation of outputs of mental function F
as differentiation of the initial state |ψ0⟩into a classical mixture of the basic states
(|γ ⟩-states determining F (see also [28]). We recall that the mental state |ψ0⟩is
generated by a neural network G from action potentials.
Let us consider a typical state transition caused by a quantum measurement (in
our model, functioning of a mental function F):
|ψ0⟩→(|γ ⟩, pγ ).
(6.29)
Here, as in the above consideration, |ψ0⟩denotes the initial state of F represented
by density operator ρo ≡|ψ0⟩⟨ψ0| ; (|γ ⟩, pγ ) denotes a classical statistical mixture
of the basis states for F.
The initial state |ψ0⟩can be expanded with respect to the F-basis as
|ψ0⟩=

γ
√pγ |γ ⟩,
where √pγ denotes a complex number satisfying |√pγ |2 = pγ , i.e., it contains the
phase as well. Hence, the density operator corresponding to the initial state can be
expressed as the sum of two terms, diagonal and off-diagonal,
|ψ0⟩⟨ψ0| =

γ
pγ |γ ⟩⟨γ | +

γ ̸=γ ′

(6.30)
The ﬁrst term 
γ pγ |γ ⟩⟨γ | corresponds to the classical probability distribu-
tion {|γ ⟩, pγ }. In physics, the process of vanishing of the second term is known
as “decoherence.” It represents accomplishment of the measurement of observable
with γ -basis. The relation of |ψ0⟩and {γ, pγ } is represented as

γ
Mγ |ψ0⟩⟨ψ0| Mγ =

γ
| ⟨γ |ψ0⟩|2 |γ ⟩⟨γ | =

γ
pγ |γ ⟩⟨γ | ,
(6.31)
with the use of projection operator Mγ = |γ ⟩⟨γ |. The transition probability
| ⟨γ |ψ0⟩|2 is equal to pγ . Thus in this model the initial probability distribution
encoded in |ψ0⟩is not deformed. We want to realize projection transformation (6.31)
as a process, i.e., to exclude the collapse-like state transformation.
We consider such a process - differentiation, the state of mental function F is
differentiated to {γ, pγ } step by step through a large number of state transitions.

Each iteration is represented by a map  in the space of density operators, a quantum
channel. State iterations are given by
ρ(0) = |ψ0⟩⟨ψ0| →ρ(1) = ρ(0) →ρ(2) = ρ(1) →· · · →ρ(n) = ρ(n −1).
This process of iterations is called differentiation [28], if

Theconcreteconstructionofquantumchannelwasdescribedin[28]andnowwe
represent it brieﬂy by coupling with the quantum-like model of brain’s functioning.
The electrochemical environment of neural network G (on that mental function F
is based) has many components. The initial quantum information states of these
components do not depend on the initial state |ψ0⟩.
Let |⟩⟨| be the initial state of one of components of the environment; it belongs
to environment’s state space denoted by K(= CN). The initial state of the compound
system belongs to state space H ⊗K. We assume that it is factorized in the tensor
product of the states of the subsystems:
|ψ0⟩⟨ψ0| ⊗|⟩⟨| ≡|ψ0⟩⟨ψ0| .
In our model, already the ﬁrst iteration through the quantum channel destroys
separability and generates the entangled state. Canonically a quantum channel is
realized with the aid of a unitary transformation of the state space of a compound
system, U : H ⊗K →H ⊗K,
U |ψ0⟩⟨ψ0| ⊗|⟩⟨| U ∗.
The operator U describes the interaction between the state of the mental function
and environment. In [28], the following concrete construction was proposed:
U =

channel. It was also shown that the off-diagonal terms in density operators ρ(n)
approach zero with factors ⟨γ |γ ′⟩n. (We remark that, since operators uγ : K →K
are unitary, vector |γ ⟩has the unit norm, so |⟨γ |γ ′⟩| < 1).
6.9
Autopoiesis: Quantum Information Representation
In fact, the presented model reﬂects only a part of brain’s functioning structure.
The brain is not feed-forward computer handling solely stimuli coming from envi-
ronment, its functioning is characterized by autopoiesis of excitation patterns. (This
is bio-information version of biological [347] and social [340] autopoiesis, see fur-
ther consideration.) Even in the absence of external stimuli the brain is spontaneously
activated by transiting stochastically among various internal states. Each state rep-
resents activation patterns of a large number of neurons. It is a sort of framework
(package) of patterns that is optimized to receive a speciﬁc external stimulus. In other
words, the brain preliminarily prepares various packages in order to react quickly to
various stimuli. Importantly, these packages of activation patterns are expected to be
formed (and memorized) gradually through multiple interactions between neurons.
This memorization is also can be modeled as a differentiation process.
We model autopoiesis by using quantum information theory, so activation patters
are associated with quantum-like states. The same state |ψ1⟩can correspond to a
package of electrochemical activation patterns. Thus, learning to possible stimuli is
performed at the quantum information level. And autopoiesis under consideration is
(quantum) bio-information autopoiesis, as reproduction quantum information states.
However, the situation is even more complicated, as we see below.
There are two stages of differentiation. The ﬁrst differentiation mechanism creates
asetofpackagesfortheneuralnetworkconnectedtooneconcreteneuron.Thesecond
differentiation mechanism leads on/off of activation for this neuron.
The second stage of differentiation can be seen as the feedback of quantum-
like dynamics to the electrochemical dynamics (that in turn generates quantum-like
states). And autopoiesis under consideration also has two levels, electrochemical and

quantum information. This is a complex issue and we shall continue its study in a
future work.

Entanglement: Physics Versus Cognition
We repeat that a pure quantum state belonging to tensor product H of state spaces
Hi of systems Si, i = 1, 2, is called entangled, if it is not separable, i.e., it cannot be
factorized into product of states belonging to spaces Hi, i = 1, 2. Entangled states
play the crucial role in quantum computing. The standard explanation of their role
can be presented in the following way. First consider some separable state
|ψ⟩= |ψ1⟩⊗|ψ2⟩.
(6.35)
Let U1 be some unitary transformation in H1, a local operation. By transforming |ψ⟩
with the aid of this operation, |ψU1⟩= |U1ψ1⟩⊗|ψ2⟩, we do not change the state of
S2. Of course, the state of compound system S = (S1, S2) is changed. However, the
reactions of states |ψ⟩and |ψU1⟩to measurements on S2 are statistically the same.
By performing measurements on S2, an observer would never get to know that the
state of S1 was changed. Now consider an entangled state, say (6.4). Then algebra
of tensor product implies that transformation U1 changes state |ψ⟩in such a way
that (statistically) reactions on measurements on S2 are changed as well. How can it
happen? Theoretically S2 can be far away from S1, say S1 on the Earth and S2 on the
Moon…
In quantum physics, this phenomenon is commonly explained by so-called quan-
tum nonlocality, the mystical action at a distance [62]. This explanation is based on
Bell’s inequality. Its violation is considered as the conﬁrmation of quantum nonlo-
cality. The latter is still actively debated (see, e.g., my recent paper [272, 286, 288,
292]). However, commonly the quantum information community feels it comfort-
ably with instantaneous action at a distance as the computational resource justifying
quantum computational superiority.
In fact, quantum nonlocality is really a mess. One typically mixes possible non-
locality of probable subquantum models, as e.g., Bohmian mechanics, and “genuine
quantum nonlocality” presented in the projection postulate [286, 288, 292]. By this
postulate a measurement on S1 with output x implies state’s projection in H1. This
instantaneously changes the total state of S and this change has a nontrivial impact
even on possible measurements on S2.
Wehavecriticizedtheuseof theprojectionpostulate[252] (that is just amathemat-
ical symbolic encoding of the complex process of the interaction with a measurement
device). Nevertheless, by using the individual interpretation of a quantum state (i.e.,
by associating a quantum state with the concrete quantum system), one confronts the
really terrible problem of explanation of “state change at a distance”. To escape this
problem, a part of the quantum community appeal to the statistical interpretation
of the quantum state (Einstein-Ballentine). By this interpretation a quantum state

represents statistical features of a large ensemble of identically prepared quantum
systems. Thus a measurement on S1 does not change the real physical state of S2.
However, it really changes the statistics of predictions for possible observations on
S2. In probability theory and statistics, such a procedure is well known and it is called
probability inference. The main difference is in the rules for probability update. The
quantum update is mathematically expressed by the projection postulate [341, 451]
or more generally via differentiation process [28].
After this rather long intercourse into quantum foundations, we turn to neurons
and our model. We are not ready to assume that neurons cooperate via the instanta-
neous action at a distance (well, compare with studies on the “really quantum brain”
[66, 67, 182, 208, 376, 393, 397, 443, 447, 448]). One of the problems with opening
the door to the action at a distance for mental states is that by saying “A” one should
also say “B” - to assume inter-brains nonlocality with all anomalous phenomena.
As was already pointed out, the quantum-like brain project does not reject com-
pletely that genuine quantum processes plays a role in the brain functioning (e.g.,
for our quantum information model, they can contribute into generation of action
potentials and transmission of signals between neurons). Following to the Cromwell
principle, I cannot even reject completely the hypothesis on mental nonlocality
(e.g., [243, 430]).
But, let us try to ﬁnd a more simple explanation of the quantum-like state update
in our model of the brain operating with quantum information states. (We recall that
these states correspond to distribution of action potentials and frequency of neurons’
ﬁrings.) We proceed in the framework of theory of open quantum (information) sys-
tems. In a neural network G (serving for accomplishment of some mental function
F), each neuron N plays the role of the environment for other neurons. Any change of
the electrochemical state of N (that is at the quantum information level is expressed
as differentiation [28]3) can be considered as a change of the environment for other
neurons. In the presence of correlations, i.e., for an entangled state, this local envi-
ronmental change induces modiﬁcation of the ﬁring pattern of other neurons. Yes,
neurons can be sufﬁciently far from each other, in different domains of the brain.
But, by taking into account the contribution of electromagnetic ﬁeld as a component
of the electrochemical interactions, we can assume that in the brain (which is very
small comparing with light’s velocity) neuronal electrochemical states can interact
very quickly. In this framework, entanglement is reduced to correlations. (So, there
is nothing mystical in it.) These correlations play the role of the statistical interaction
between neurons, by modifying the rates of their ﬁrings. The crucial point is that
these are correlations at the level of quantum information states. They can be stable
even for chaotic patterns in underlying electrochemical dynamics (described by the
Hodgkin–Huxley equation and its generalizations).
3 We note that differentiation process uniﬁes both unitary state transformation and measurement.
There is no such sharp distinguishing between them as in the projection measurement scheme.

Ontic and Epistemic Portrayals of Mental Processes
This section is devoted to the discussion on the ontic-epistemic structure of func-
tioning of a mental function. This discussion is merely of the philosophical and
methodological value and the reader who is not interested in such issues can jump
to the last section of this chapter.
Physical and Informational Representations
Interrelation of the electrochemical and quantum information states of the brain is
the complex problem. The evolving (via quantum dynamics) state ρ(t) is the quan-
tum information state encoding uncertainty in the action potentials of the neurons
composing the network G. The signals coming from the environment E are electro-
chemical. And they determine the operator coefﬁcients of the GKSL equation or the
unitary operators encoding differentiation. In this way, our model connects physical
and information states.
Discreteness, the Notion of Phenomenon
One of the distinguishing features of this encoding is its discreteness. The classical
action potential, see Fig. 6.1, is continuous. But, the quantum information state is
superposition of the basis states corresponding to the discrete alphabet of a neural
code.
Discreteness (quantization of observable’s outcomes) plays the crucial role in
quantum mechanics. Bohr emphasized this within formalization based on the notion
of phenomenon - a discrete event of observation, say a dot on the registration photo-
emulsion screen in the interference experiments or the click of a detector, see Bohr
[74] (vol. 2, p. 64):
... in actual experiments, all observations are expressed by unambiguous statements referring,
forinstance,totheregistrationofthepointatwhichanelectronarrivesataphotographicplate.
... the appropriate physical interpretation of the symbolic quantum mechanical formalism
amounts only to predictions, of determinate or statistical character, pertaining to individual
phenomena ... .
Thus, although quantum theory produces statistical predictions, its observables
generate individual phenomena. Discreteness of detection events is the fundamental
feature of quantum physics justifying existence of quantum systems, carriers of
quanta. Hence, quantum mechanics provides the discrete representation of nature
which is constructed via discrete events of observations. This issue is not so trivial
and in modern foundational literature it is often completely ignored. Operating with
phenomena, discrete detection events, instead of continuous signals, is in fact one of
the main foundational issues of quantum mechanics.
This theme is important, e.g., in distinguishing “classical” and “genuine quantum”
entanglements [288, 292]. The former is entanglement of the degrees of freedom of
the classical electromagnetic ﬁeld [320, 418, 419], the latter is entanglement of
the degrees of freedom of quantum systems, e.g., atoms or photons.4 Otherwise
4 May be the expression “degrees of freedom” is misleading; may be it is better to speak about
entanglement of observables.

6.11 Ontic and Epistemic Portrayals of Mental Processes
87
to explain this difference one should appeal to the ambiguous notion of quantum
nonlocality (spooky action at a distrance) [418, 419] This issue is closely related to
distinguishing of quantum and quasi-classical theories, see Grangier et al. [180] for
such experiments which are known as the “photon existence experiments”.
Ground and Upper Levels of Brain’s Functioning
As was already mentioned, we proceed with the two-level structuring of scientiﬁc
theories, the ontic-epistemic one. From Bohr’s viewpoint, quantum mechanics is an
epistemic theory, and it is important to add “of discrete (quantized) observations.”
The electrochemical processes belong to the ontic level – physical reality of brain’s
functioning. Quantum information processing belongs to the epistemic level, i.e.,
brain’s mental functions represent their knowledge about the surrounding environ-
ment within the quantum information framework.
This is the good place to repeat once again that the quantum information repre-
sentation does not need to be related to quantum physics in the brain. The quantum
information states (superpositions of the classical states of a neural code) can be
generated by macroscopic electrochemical waves propagating in the brain. In fact,
we use the quantum information counterpart of quantum theory.
However, by following the writings of the fathers of quantum theory, especially
Bohr [74] and Schrödinger [407], we immediately understand that they also used
the information interpretation (well, without using the notion “information). This
interpretation was further developed in the works of Zeilinger and Brukner [86],
Plotnitsky [379], D’Ariano [110], Fuchs and Schack [165]. In fact, QBism is so to
say the extreme version of the information interpretation (the epistemic viewpoint
on quantum theory), QBists highlighted the individual agent perspective on mea-
surement’s outcomes. As was noted in Chap. 1, in quantum-like modeling QBism’s
viewpoint is very attractive [192]. In this chapter, the role of an individual agent is
played by a mental function.
Our model suggested the two-level description of brain’s functioning:
• The ground level: electrochemical processes in the brain and body.
• The upper level: quantum information processing of superpositions of neural
code’s states.
Genuine Quantum Physical Processes in the Brain
In principle, we do not reject the possibility that quantum physical processes in the
brain, say at cells’ membranes, can contribute to generation of the quantum informa-
tion states. Here, one should distinguish two different sorts of quantum theoretical
description:
• quantum physical theory at the micro-scale (the ontic level),
• quantum information theory at the macro-scale (the epistemic level).
Both portrayals are based on the same mathematical formalism, the quantum for-
malism of complex Hilbert state space. I see one crucial difference between these
two quantum portrayals. Quantum physical theory is based on inﬁnite dimensional
Hilbert spaces of the L2-type; quantum information theory is based on ﬁnite dimen-
sional n-qubit spaces.

Brain Functioning
Ontic and Epistemic Levels of Quantum Information Representation
The outputs of a mental function F are determined by subspaces H f ;G : F = f
for |ψ⟩∈H f ;G (with probability one). In the operator terms, F is described by
projections (Q f ) on the subspaces (H f ;G). These projections determine the outputs’
probabilities In the von Neumann formalism, decomposition of projections Q f into
one dimensional projections (|γ ⟩⟨γ |) corresponding to the F-basis (|γ ⟩),
Q f =

|γ ⟩∈H f ;G
|γ ⟩⟨γ |,
(6.36)
does not play any role; it is hidden even from F which cannot approach its own
internal structure; a mental function self-observes only the outputs F = f.
However, decision-making via differentiation (Sect. 6.8) explores the basis (|γ ⟩).
This basis determines the hidden structure of F which is not visible for F by itself, for
F as a self-observer. We can interpret vectors (|γ ⟩) as hidden variables and modeling
of functioning of F in terms of these vectors as ontic. The portrayal of F in terms of
projections (Q f ) is epistemic, it is about knowledge which F extracts from (quantum
information) states of the neural network G.
We emphasize that both these descriptions are quantum. This is interesting, since
typically the quantum description is epistemic and the ontic one is classical (see
Atmanspacher [32], Khrennikov [255].
The primary level of onticity given by action potentials, onticity of the elec-
trochemical processes in the brain (and generally in human’s body). The γ -basis
description is epistemic w.r.t. the electrochemical one. Thus, our framework has the
multilevel ontic-epistemic structure. Each lower level is treated as ontic w.r.t. the
next higher level which in turn is treated as ontic for the next higher level.
To call the γ -portrayal epistemic, we should point out to some observer who
“sees” the γ -structure of the (quantum information) states of G. Who is it?
A mental function F operates (as an observer) in the conscious domain of brain’s
mental processing. We can speculate that γ -representation corresponds to operation
in the unconscious domain. Transformation of action potentials into the neural code
basis (|α⟩) and then into (|γ ⟩)-basis happens without coupling to consciousness.
And the process of state differentiation (Sect. 6.8) w.r.t. (|γ ⟩)-basis also happens
unconsciously. We can imagine that each F (treated as a self-observer) is based on
an unconscious quantum processing device described as a quantum channel. And the
latter is determined by the γ -basis.
As is typical in ontic-epistemic structuring of scientiﬁc theories, the same epis-
temic model may have a few different ontic models beyond it. In the above quantum
ontic-epistemic framework, the selections of different bases in the subspaces H f ;G
correspond to the use of different hidden variables (ontic structures). These structures
correspond to the different signatures of the environments (Sect. 6.8.1) of the neural
network G – the neural basis of F = FG.

Concluding Discussion on Quantum-Like Modeling
of Brain’s Functioning
Quantum information revolution stimulated essentially applications of the quantum
formalism to model cognition and decision-making. Generally such modeling is not
based on real quantum physics; the brain is considered as a black box processing
information in accordance of the laws of quantum information and probability. The
natural problem of coupling of the quantum-like models with the electrochemical
processes in the brain arises. Following [284, 291], we proceed toward solving this
problem with the two-level model, with classical electrochemical (ontic) level and
quantum-like (epistemic) level.
In this model, uncertainty in generation of spikes is transformed into quantum-
like superposition. The main idea is that the brain is able to transfer the nonlinear
dynamics of the Hodgkin–Huxley type [206] into linear quantum-like dynamics. At
the level of coding, this means that a classical neural code is extended to include
superposition states. By moving from the nonlinear dynamics of the electrochemical
processes in neural networks, the brain is able to escape chaotic behavior. The latter
is characteristic for nonlinear dynamical systems, including the Hodgkin–Huxley
differential equation [4, 5, 207].
We realize a mental function as a quantum-like observable. Here we put the
emphasis to the evident fact that the brain is an open system. Since the theory of
open quantum systems is the most general mathematical theory of open systems, it
is natural to apply it for modeling of brain’s functioning (see [18, 19, 24, 26, 27,
284, 291] and [397, 447, 448]). We analyze advantages and disadvantages of the
canonical quantum measurement scheme based on the projection postulate as well as
the open system model based on the quantum dynamical equation (with Markovean
and non-Markovean dynamics). Finally, we presented a very general scheme (differ-
entiation [28]) for transformation of quantum-like superpositions corresponding to
action potentials’ uncertainty into classical statistical mixtures of decision states.
The use of the quantum measurement theory to model brain’s functioning leads
to the fundamental foundational problem of external versus internal (self-) observa-
tions. We brieﬂy discussed this problem in Sect. 6.9 in connection with information
autopoiesis in brain’s functioning. This problem is far from clariﬁcation.

Emotional Coloring of Conscious
Experiences
7.1
Quantum Formalization of Emotional Coloring
of Conscious Experiences
We start with the following citation from [328]:
Although emotions, or feelings, are the most signiﬁcant events in our lives, there has been
relatively little contact between theories of emotion and emerging theories of consciousness
in cognitive science.
We want to formalize this contact with the aid of the quantum-like theory of
consciousness [268].1 We apply the mathematical model of cooperative work of
unconsciousness and consciousness to describe the process of emotional coloring of
perceptions and more general conscious experiences including decision-making. The
brain performs self-measurements. To model such self-measurements, we split the
brain, as an information processor, into two subsystems, unconsciousness UC and
consciousness C. The former plays the role of a system under observation and the
latter of an observer [268].2 To model the cooperation of perceptions and emotions,
the state space of UC is decomposed into the tensor product of corresponding state
spaces,
HUC = Hper ⊗Hem.
(7.1)
Two classes of observables Oper and Oem are invented: for conscious experiencing
of perceptions and emotions, respectively. These are observables acting on the state
spaces Hper and Hem. In this sense these are “psycho-local observables”. However,
the tensor product of a perception-observable and an emotion-observable acts on

Emotional Coloring of Conscious Experiences
HUC and the entanglement effect of the unconscious states coupled to perceptions
and emotions plays the important role. In principle, it can be checked experimentally
(see Sect. 7.9).
The domain of applicability of our quantum-like model is not restricted to emo-
tional coloring of perceptions; we present the very general scheme of coloring of
one class of conscious experiences with another, “basic experiences” are colored
with “supplementary experiences”. The aim and the origin of such coloring will be
discussed below. Generally, we operate with the tensor decomposition
HUC = Hbas ⊗Hsup.
(7.2)
And the two classes of observables Obas and Osup are invented.
Emotional coloring is coupled to quantum contextuality—emotion observables
determine contexts for perceptions and other basic conscious experiences which are
also treated as observables. We highlight that contextualization reduces degenera-
tion of spectra for observables belonging to the set Obas and acting in the space
of unconscious states HUC. Such contextual reduction is very important, since
the unconsciousness state space HUC has high dimension. Each conscious expe-
rience a = x is based on multidimensional eigensubspace Hx of HUC. We follow
Chap. 17 and treat contextuality very generally, as Bohr contextuality. We recall
that the Bohr contextuality-complementarity principle leads to rejection of ”naive
realism”. Observable’s outcomes cannot be interpreted as the objective properties of
systems. The observed value cannot be assigned to a system before measurement; it
is created in the complex process of interaction between a system and a measurement
apparatus.
7.2
The First and Higher Order Theories of Consciousness
There are two basic and competing theories of consciousness:
• the First Order Theory of Consciousness [70, 71, 129, 324, 432];
• the Higher Order Theory of Consciousness [97, 326, 396].
We characterize these theories with the following citation from [328]:
First-order theorists, such as Block, argue that processing related to a stimulus is all that is
needed for there to be phenomenal consciousness of that stimulus [70, 71, 129, 324, 432].
Conscious states, on these kinds of views, are states that make us aware of the external
environment. Additional processes, such as attention, working memory, and metacognition,
simply allow cognitive access to and introspection about the ﬁrst-order state. In the case
of visual stimuli, the ﬁrst-order representation underlying phenomenal consciousness is
usually said to involve the visual cortex, especially the secondary rather than primary visual
cortex. Cortical circuits, especially involving the prefrontal and parietal cortex, simply make
possible cognitive or introspective access to the phenomenal experience occurring in the
visual cortex.

7.2 The First and Higher Order Theories of Consciousness
93
In contrast, David Rosenthal and other higher-order theorists argue that a ﬁrst-order state
resulting from stimulus-processing alone is not enough to make possible the conscious
experience of a stimulus. In addition to having a representation of the external stimulus one
also must be aware of this stimulus representation. This is made possible by a HOR, which
makes the ﬁrst-order state conscious. In other words, consciousness exists by virtue of the
relation between the ﬁrst- and higher-order states. Cognitive processes, such as attention,
working memory, and metacognition are key to the conscious experience of the ﬁrst-order
state. In neural terms, the areas of the GNC, such as the prefrontal and parietal cortex, make
conscious the sensory information represented in the secondary visual cortex.
The Higher Order Theory distinguishes between unconscious and conscious pro-
cessing of mental information in the brain. By this theory, what makes cognition
conscious is a higher-order observation of the ﬁrst-order processing. And in quantum
theory observation is not simply inspection of the system’s state. This is a complex
process of interaction between a system and a measurement device. This is the good
place to cite Bohr again [74] (see Chap. 17):
This crucial point ... implies the impossibility of any sharp separation between the behaviour
of atomic objects and the interaction with the measuring instruments which serve to deﬁne
the conditions under which the phenomena appear. In fact, the individuality of the typical
quantum effects ﬁnds its proper expression in the circumstance that any attempt of subdivid-
ing the phenomena will demand a change in the experimental arrangement introducing new
possibilities of interaction between objects and measuring instruments which in principle
cannot be controlled.
This viewpoint matches better with the Higher Order Theory of Consciousness.
A conscious experience is not simply introspection of the UC-state.
In this chapter, we proceed without describing the process of UC −C interaction.
In particular, we do not operate with the states of C and we do not appeal to the scheme
of indirect quantum measurements (Sect. 8.4). We neither apply the general theory
of quantum instruments, but use only the observables given by PVMs (Sect. 2.1).
We remark that, although Bohr’s viewpoint on the outcomes of quantum measure-
ments dominates in QM, a few respectable scientists claimed that these outcomes can
be considered as the objective properties of physical systems. They treat quantum
measurements as just approaching the premeasurement values of observables, the
objective properties of the systems under observation. This position was presented
in the paper of Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen (EPR) [142]. Later Bell elaborated (and
modiﬁed) EPR’s argument [60, 62], but he confronted the problem of nonlocality
(Chap. 17). This line of thought matches better to the First Order Theory of Con-
sciousness. We will follow Bohr’s line of thought [73] and hence couple quantum
measurement theory with the Higher Order Theory of Consciousness.
In application to emotions, the First Order Theory of Consciousness matches the
somatic theories of emotions rooted to James [215]; the ﬁrst of them is James-Lange
theory [96]. Nowadays this viewpoint on emotions is advertised by some prominent
neuro-physiologists, e.g., Damasio [33].

Emotional Coloring of Conscious Experiences
7.3
Contextuality of The Higher Order Theory
of Consciousness
The quantum-like model of this paper formalizes the general scheme of the Higher
Order Theory of Consciousness, as the mathematical framework for generation of
conscious experiences as the outcomes of measurements performed by consciousness
over unconsciousness and based on interaction between them.
Besides formalization of the general scheme, the model describes the concrete
feature of the Higher Order Theory of Consciousness—emotional contextualization
of conscious experiences such as perceptions and decisions. This model highlighted
contextuality of information processing by the brain in the concrete framework of
emotional coloring.
Contextuality can be tested experimentally, as was done in both in physics and
cognition with tests based on the Bell-type inequalities (see Chap. 17). Contextuality
is a delicate property of cognition, and it is one of the signatures of indeterminacy of
conscious experiences generation process. Indeterminacy mathematical characteri-
zation is the impossibility to deﬁne JPD for some observables. In quantum physics
such observables are called incompatible ones. Their existence is a consequence
of Bohr’s contextuality-complementarity principle. Mathematically this principle is
supported by the rules of quantization: classical variables with nontrivial Poisson
brackets are transformed into quantum observables with nontrivial commutators.
Indeterminacy of conscious experiences is well accepted in cognitive studies.
Therefore, one may ask why contextuality has not been widely tested in experimental
research? The recent interest to contextual studies, both theoretical and experimental,
diffused to cognition from quantum theory. The possible answer is that the basic
experimental protocols in cognitive studies are grounded on one ﬁxed complex of
experimental conditions, but to check contextuality, an experiment has to involve at
least three, but better even four, different experimental complexes. The majority of
experiments were not done in such multi-contextual framework.
7.4
Perceptions and Emotions
Perception Representation of Sensations
We follow to von Helmholtz [449] theory of sensation-perception. Perceptions are not
simplycopiesofsensations,not“impressionsliketheimprintofakeyonwax”,butthe
results of complex signal processing including unconscious cognitive processing. In
the modern science formulation, the process of perception creation can be described
as follows [354]:
Sensory information undergoes extensive associative elaboration and attentional modulation
as it becomes incorporated into the texture of cognition. This process occurs along a core

7.4 Perceptions and Emotions
95
synaptic hierarchy which includes the primary sensory, upstream unimodal, downstream
unimodal, heteromodal, paralimbic and limbic zones of the cerebral cortex.
Contexts Representation by Emotions
As is emphasized in [328],
Emotion schema are learned in childhood and used to categorize situations as one goes
through life. As one becomes more emotionally experienced, the states become more differ-
entiated: fright comes to be distinguished from startle, panic, dread, and anxiety.
In our terminology, each emotion-generation scheme is crystallized on the
basic life-contexts. Context-labeling is the basic function of emotions. Surround-
ing environment contextualization was one of the ﬁrst biosystems cognitive tasks,
and this ability was developed in parallel with the sensation-perception system’s
establishment.
Memory is heavily involved in emotional activity, both for memorizing the con-
texts’ features and for comparison of new perceptions with these contexts. (See, e.g.,
[329] for the memory’s role in cognition). Thus, evolutionary a mental information
processing system representing the basic life-contexts was designed. This system is
ﬁxed at the level of the brain, and more generally, the nervous system, hardware.
But, memorizing a contextual experiences’ variety is done on the basis of the expe-
riencing various situations (see above citation from [328]). This context-refection
system was the root of the present emotion-system in humans. The latter has com-
plex cognitive functions, not only contextual. However, in this paper we concern
mainly contextuality.
Emotions represent adaptive reactions to environmental challenges; they are a
result of human evolution; from the viewpoint of computational resources they pro-
vided optimal solutions to ancient and recurring problems that faced our ancestors
[143].3
We emphasize that in our model emotions are conscious, cf. [328]:
One of our view’s implication is that emotions can never be unconscious. Responses con-
trolled by subcortical survival circuits that operate unconsciously sometimes occur in con-
junction with emotional feelings but are not emotions. An emotion is the conscious expe-
rience that occurs when you are aware that you are in particular kind of situation that you
have come, through your experiences, to think of as a fearful situation. If you are not aware
that you are afraid, you are not afraid; if you are not afraid, you aren’t feeling fear.
3 Although we do not follow the James-Lange theory of emotions [96], this is the good place to
mention that James [215] pointed out that “feeling of the same changes as they occur is the emotion.
Here, for us the key words are “the same changes as they occur”, i.e., the complex of repeatable
bodily changes—physiological encoding of a context.

Emotional Coloring of Conscious Experiences
7.5
Unconscious and Conscious Information Processing
7.5.1
Unconsciousness as System
An essential part of information processing in the brain is performed unconsciously;
the information system responsible for such processing, call it unconsciousness, is
denoted by the symbol UC. The space of its states is denoted by H ≡HUC. In the
quantum-like model, this is a complex Hilbert space.
The reader does not need couple the notion of unconsciousness with the names
of James [216], Freud [155], and Jung [219] (although the author of this paper was
strongly inﬂuenced by them, cf. with the previous works [6]–[229]). In this book,
UC denotes a special collection of information processors of the brain performing
pre-observational mental state processing.
7.5.2
Consciousness as Observer
Perceptions and emotions are commonly treated as conscious entities. So, in our
model the brain contains another information processing system generating con-
scious experiences; denote it by the symbol C. In our quantum-like framework, its
functioning is modeled as performing measurements on the system UC. Introduc-
tion of two systems UC and C matches the quantum measurement scheme, UC is
the analog of a physical system exposed to measurements and C is the analog of a
complex of measurement apparatuses.
We note that unconscious-conscious modeling of the brain’s functioning matches
well to the philosophic paradigm of ontic-epistemic structuring of scientiﬁc theories.
The ontic level is about both physical and mental reality as it is if nobody observes
it, the epistemic level describes observations (see Atmanspacher [32]). In contrast to
quantum physics, in our model the epistemic level is related not to external observers,
but to brain’s self-observations. In the brain, unconscious and conscious processes
are closely coupled and the sharp separation between them is impossible (cf. Brenner
[80] and Brenner and Igamberdiev [81].
7.5.3
Unconscious and Conscious Generation of Perceptions
and Emotions
In this paper, we shall be mainly concentrated on functioning of two information
processors transforming
• sensations →perceptions,
• contexts →emotions.

7.6 Incompatible Conscious Observables
97
Both processors have conscious outputs. Their functioning is strongly correlated; in
the formalism of quantum theory correlations are represented by entangled states.
We denote unconscious counterparts of these processors by the symbols UCper and
UCem, respectively. In modeling of the emotional coloring of perception (its contex-
tualization), we shall consider the compound information system (UCper, UCem).
This is the good place to mention the ﬁrst theory of emotions, the James-Lange
theory [96]. James claimed that
“I am trembling. Therefore I am afraid.” He stated: “My thesis ... is that the bodily
changes follow directly the perception of the exciting fact and that our feeling of the
same changes as they occur is the emotion.” This way of thinking matches with
the First Order Theory of Consciousness and the EPR-Bell viewpoint on quantum
measurements.
Following LeDoux [329] (see also [328]), we treat emotions within the Higher
Order Theory of Consciousness coupled to Bohr’s interpretation of quantum mea-
surements.
7.5.4
Conscious Experiences: Basic and Supplementary
Although we are mainly interested in perceptions’ emotional coloring, the formalism
under consideration can be applied to the very general class of compound informa-
tion processing systems, (UCbas, UCsup). The latter is used for determining stable
repeatable and evolutionary ﬁxed contexts for the former. Simplest generalization of
the perception-emotion scheme is emotional contextualization of decision-making
which modeling is based the compound system (UCdm, UCem).
Generation of conscious experiences (basic and supplementary) is modeled with
quantum observables; denote the corresponding classes by the symbols Obas and
Osup. In particular, we shall consider the pairs (Oper, Oem) and (Odm, Oem).
An expert in cognition may suggest other pairs of basic and supplementary con-
scious experiences. One of the properties of the supplementary mental experiences
is their rapid processing. They wouldn’t inhibit the basic mental experiences pro-
cessing. We remark that emotion’s generation is characterized by high speed (see
[329]).
7.6
Incompatible Conscious Observables
We stress that the space of observables Oper can contain incompatible perceptions as
well as Oem can contain incompatible emotions. In physics incompatibility is often
seen as the exotic property of quantum theory—comparing with classical physi-
cal theory. Philosophically, this notion is formalized in the Bohr’s contextuality-
complementarity principle. In the mental framework, the notion of incompatibility

98

Emotional Coloring of Conscious Experiences
can be interpreted very naturally. There exist incompatible emotions which cannot
be experienced simultaneously; say happiness and sadness, pride and shame. And it
is also evident that there exist incompatible, i.e., jointly unobservable, perceptions
and other conscious experiences, say hot and cold. We stress once again that mental
observations are brain’s self-observations. This self-observational structure clariﬁes
the incompatibility issue.
The necessity to operate with various incompatible conscious entities, or mental
observables, is the main root of the quantum-like information representation. In the
absence of incompatibility, i.e., if, for the same mental state, the brain was able to
construct the consistent probabilistic representation in the form of JPD of all possible
combinations of say emotions, the quantum state formalism would be unnecessary.
7.7
Degeneration Resolution of Conscious Experiences
via Contextual Coloring
We start with presentation of the general scheme for the resolution of degenera-
tion of the C-outcomes. In this scheme C operates with two classes of observables
Obas and Osup representing the “basic and supplementary conscious experiences”,
respectively.
General Scheme
In the quantum-like model of conscious experience generation [268], consciousness
C is modeled as a system performing observations over unconsciousness UC. As in
Sect. 7.5.1, the symbol H denotes the space of UC-states.
A conscious observable a is mathematically described as a PVM-observable
(Sect. 2.1) Ea = (Ea(x), x ∈X), where X is the set of conscious experiences. The
latter can be, for example, the set of language expression or visual images. The values
of an observable are determined by the subspaces Ha
x (see Postulate 2QL, Chap. 10,
Sect. 10.2). If consciousness C detects a state belonging to Ha
x , then it feels the
conscious experience x ∈X.
The space of unconscious states H has high dimension. In reality, it is inﬁnite
dimensional, since this is quantum information representation of the electrochem-
ical waves in the brain (see [284] for details). We restrict modeling to the ﬁnite-
dimensional case; state spaces have very high dimension, dim H >> 1.
If the “conscious-experience vocabulary” X (for observable a) is not so large, i.e.,
number of points in set X << dim H, the same conscious experience x is generated
by huge variety of unconscious states. This degeneration is not good for cognitive
behavior— reactions to external and internal stimuli and communications with other
humans, especially for the latter.
How can the brain, as the self-observable, reduce this mental state degeneration?
The answer is known from quantum theory(Chap. 17, Sect. 17.14). Consciousness
C has to complete a-observation, where a is represented by PVM Ea ∈Obs with

7.7 Degeneration Resolution of Conscious Experiences via Contextual Coloring
99
observation of a compatible observable b with Eb ∈Osup. The latter plays the role of
contextforthea-observation.Thevaluea = x iscontextualizedwiththevalueb = y.
In each outcome (x, y) of the joint measurement of (a, b), the value x represents the
basic conscious experience and y represents contextual coloring by a supplementary
observation, e.g., emotion.
The crucial point is that such contextualization-observable b should not carry
conscious meaning which is directly related to the a-meaning, otherwise the joint
observation (a = x1, b = x2) can essentially modify the meaning of the outcome
a = x1. It is also preferable that b-observation can be combined not only with a-
observation, but with observation of any a′ with Ea′ ∈Obas. So, the same context can
be used for coloring of various conscious experiences, e.g., perceptions or decisions.
We proceed with PVM-observables; in particular, to enrich selection of outcomes’
vocabularies. However, the reader can use Hermitian operators and restrict all vocab-
ularies to subsets of the real line. In the operator-observables framework, the condi-
tion of compatibility is formulated simply as [A, B] = 0 for any A ∈Obas and any
B ∈Osup. In our PVM-observables framework, we proceed with the condition
[Ea(x), Eb(y)] = 0 for observables represented by PVMs Ea = (Ea(x)), Eb = (Eb(y)),
(7.3)
or symbolically
[Obas, Osup] = 0.
(7.4)
In general two PVM-observables Ea, Ea′ ∈Obas do not commute, i.e., there can exist
two projectors such that [Ea(x), Ea′(x′)] ̸= 0. Thus, an arbitrary Ea′ ∈Obas cannot
be used for reﬁnement of Ea ∈Obas.
As was mentioned, for the outcome a = x the co-outcome b = y can be con-
sidered as coloring of the experience a = x. Cognitive Obas-representation can be
compared with black-white pictures of houses in a town, the Osup-representation
adds colors: the house a = x is “colored” with the color b = y. Here we use “color-
ing” metaphorically. Conscious experiences of (x, y) and (x, ˜y), where x ∈X and
y, ˜y ∈Y (the value-sets for a and b) can differ essentially.
Thus, appeal to supplementary conscious experiences given by the set of observ-
ables Osup tremendously enriches the set of basic conscious experiences. At the
level of mental states, it makes correspondence between states and experiences less
degenerate. The latter helps a lot in social communication between individuals.
In principle, Obas also can contain compatible observables, say Ea, Ea′ such that
[Ea(x), Ea′(x′)] = 0. In such a case, the outcomes of a′ might be used by C for “col-
oring” of the outcomes of a and vice verse. However, the Osup-coloring is preferable.
The set of observables Osup is speciﬁed by C at the level of hardware and software.
Consciousness C does not need to check whether an observable represented in Osup
can be used or not for coloring of an arbitrary observable a represented by Ea ∈Obas.
Another problem with mutual coloring of observables a, a′ is that both carry impor-
tant cognitive meanings and coloring of a by a′ (or vice versa) can modify the
cognitive meaning of a, since C should process simultaneously two basic conscious
functions.

100
7
Emotional Coloring of Conscious Experiences
And ﬁnally, we repeat that generation of outcomes of observables given by PVMs
belonging to Obas is slower—in some situations, e.g., for emotional coloring, essen-
tially slower [329]—than generation of observables given by Osup. So, by attempting
to color a with Ea ∈Obas by a′ with Ea′ ∈Obas, C would consume more time and
even time scale inconsistency can be a problem.
Emotional Coloring of Perceptions
In the above scheme, we set Obas ≡Oper and Osup ≡Oem. As was stated in
Sect.7.5.3,theinformationprocessingsystemUCcontainsthefollowingtwosubsys-
tems. One is involved in processing of sensations into perceptions—still unconscious
processing; denote it as UCper. Another system UCem processes unconscious emo-
tional states. The corresponding state spaces denote by the symbols Hper ≡HUC;per
and Hem ≡HUC;em, respectively.
GenerallyUCisnotreducedtoUCper andUCem.But,forsimplicity,formodeling
emotional coloring of perceptions, we assume that UC is solely compound of these
subsystems. This is really oversimpliﬁed picture of unconsciousness functioning
which is not reduced to sensations into perceptions transformation and emotional
states generation. But, we proceed in this framework.
7.8
Tensor Product Decomposition of Unconscious State
Space
Now we turn again to the general scheme of modeling of the basic and supplemen-
tary conscious experiences. Before we have operated with the corresponding sets
of observables Obas and Osup. Now we would like to proceed in the dual frame-
work by operating with the corresponding states. In quantum information theory,
contextuality is typically presented within the tensor product formalism.
Let, as above, H be the state space of UC. Suppose that it is factorized in the
tensor product H = Hbas ⊗Hsup, where Hbas and Hsup are state spaces coupled to
the basic and supplementary conscious experiences. At the conscious level, they are
described by observables belonging to the sets Obas and Osup. These states spaces
are generated by two different unconscious information processing systems, say
UCbas and UCsup. These systems are concentrated in different brain’s areas created
at the different stages of the brain’s evolution. However, concentration is not sharp,
processing is distributed, and the processing areas have overlap.
The complex
Hilbert space H is the state space of the compound system (UCbas, UCsup). In the
present model, it can be identiﬁed with unconsciousness, UC. (Generally UC has
more complex structure.)
Observables belonging to Obas and Osup express measurements which are per-
formedbyConthesubsystemsUCbas andUCsup,respectively.Ifobservablesa, b are
mathematically described as Hermitian operators A : Hbas →Hbas and B : Hsup →
Hsup, then their joint measurement is expressed by the operator A ⊗B : H →H.
For PVM-observables, we use the same scheme. For observables a and b with

7.8 Tensor Product Decomposition of Unconscious State Space
101
PVMs Ea = (Ea(x)) and Eb = (Eb(y)), their joint measurement is mathematically
expressed by PVM Eab = (Ea(x) ⊗Eb(y)).
The state space H = Hbas ⊗Hsup is generated by tensor products of the form
ψbas ⊗ψsup. The measurements of observables on such separable states are reduced
to independent measurements on the subsystems UCbas and UCsup. The quantum
effects are visible for entangled states.
For example, let both state spaces be two dimensional (qubit spaces), and let | ja⟩
and | jb⟩, ja, jb = 0, 1, be orthonormal bases in Hbas and Hsup. Let observables a
and b be described by PVMs corresponding to these bases, i.e.,
Ea
ja = | ja⟩⟨ja|, Eb
jb = | jb⟩⟨jb|,
where ja, jb = 0, 1. Set | ja jb⟩= | ja⟩⊗| jb⟩; this is an orthonormal basis in the state
space H of the compound system S = (UCbas, UCsup). Then the states of S can be
expanded w.r.t. this basis.
ψ =

ji
c ji| ji⟩,

ji
|c ji|2 = 1.
(7.5)
By Born’s rule P(a = x1 j, b = x2i|ψ) = |c ji|2 is the probability that C observes the
perception-emotion pair (x1 j, x2i).
For example, the state
ψ = (|00⟩+ |11⟩)/
√
2
(7.6)
is entangled. This state illustrates the correlation meaning of entanglement—in fact,
the maximal entanglement. Suppose that observables a and b yield the real values
x10, x11 and x20, x21, respectively. Consider quantum-like modeling of emotional
coloring of perception, i.e., for Hbas = Hper, Hsup = Hem. Perception a = x1 j is
ﬁrmly associated with emotion b = x2 j, j = 0, 1. Thus, this state represents the
perfect correlations between the a-perception and the b-emotion.
The general two qubit state given by superposition (7.5) encodes correlation
⟨ab⟩ψ ≡

w.r.t. state ψ ∈H. The last sum is the classical probabilistic expression for corre-
lation. Thus, each concrete pair (perception, emotion) or (decision, emotion) can be
described in the classical probabilistic framework. In particular, by experimenting
with just one pair we would not detect the quantum-like effects.

102

Emotional Coloring of Conscious Experiences
Consider, for the same perception a given mathematically by Ea ∈Oper, another
emotion b′ with Eb′ ∈Oem and correlation ⟨ab′⟩ψ; it can be expressed with the
coefﬁcients with respect to the basic (| ja jb′⟩= | ja⟩⊗| jb′⟩),

This is also the classical expression for correlation.
7.9
CHSH Inequality: Test of Emotional Contextuality
Now let us consider the correlation-expressions (7.7), (7.8) jointly. If emotional-
observables b and b′ with Eb = (Eb(y)) and E′ = (Eb′(y′) are incompatible, i.e.,
in the mathematical terms, there exist projectors such that [Eb(y), Eb′(y′)] ̸= 0,
then generally it is impossible to combine these two classical correlations in the sin-
gle classical probabilistic model. This is the complex foundational problem which
experimental testing is formalized with the aid of Bell-type inequalities [60, 62, 106]
(Chap. 17). As we have seen in Chap. 17, the Bell inequalities can be interpreted as
the special tests of JMC contextuality. The latter earns the heuristically clear interpre-
tation as the special form of Born’s contextuality. By accepting Bohr’s contextuality-
complementarity principle we reject “mental realism”, i.e., the assumption that say
all possible emotions peacefully coexist in any mental state.
Inthischaptermentalcontextualitywasstraightforwardlydescribedascontextual-
ization of one, basic conscious experience by another, supplementary, say perception
by emotion, or decision by emotion. Hence, mental contextuality is less mysterious
than physical contextuality. Here, the crucial role of incompatibility is evident, e.g.,
incompatible emotions induce incompatible contexts.
In quantum physics experimental testing of the Bell-type inequalities is the hot
topic (Chap. 17). In psychology and decision-making, they have been tested as well
(Chap. 17). We hope that this book can stimulate such experimenting in conscious-
ness studies with joint measurements of the pairs (A, B) = (perception, emotion) or
(decision-making, emotion). As in physics and the previous psychological experi-
ments, it is natural to test the CHSH inequality [106]. To proceed with it, it is not
enough to consider just one perception (decision-making) a and two incompatible
emotions b and b′. One has to work with two incompatible perceptions a and a′ and
form cyclically their correlations. The CHSH correlation function is given by the
following combination of correlations (Chap. 17):
CCHSH = ⟨ab⟩+ ⟨ab′⟩+ ⟨a′b⟩−⟨a′b′⟩
(7.9)

7.10 Concluding Remarks on Emotional Coloring
103
and, for dichotomous observables yielding values ±1 the CHSH-inequality holds:
|CCHSH| ≤2.
(7.10)
Finally, we stress that the psychological studies demonstrated that the humans behav-
ior differs from the behavior of quantum physical systems w.r.t. so-called signaling
problem (Chap. 17). It would be interesting to check whether experiments with
emotions would lead to signaling or not. My conjecture is that, for some mental
states, emotional coloring—contextualization— can be performed without signaling.
I stress that the proposed emotion-experiments differ from the previously performed
psychological experiments in which experimenters operated with pairs composed of
two decisions, i.e., one decision played the role of context for another (Chap. 17).
7.10
Concluding Remarks on Emotional Coloring
We presented the quantum-like model of emotional coloring of perceptions and other
conscious experiences, including decision-making.4 The brain, as the information
processor, is decomposed into two sub-processors, unconsciousness UC and con-
sciousness C. The latter plays the role of an observer on the former. This is mental
realization of the quantum measurement scheme for self-observations performed by
the brain. The state space of UC is mathematically described as a complex Hilbert
space of very high dimension. In this paper, we do not model the process of UC −C
interaction. Conscious observables are represented in the operator formalism. Per-
ceptions and emotions are described by two classes of PVM-observables, Oper and
Oem. Perceptions are compatible with emotions, i.e., they can be jointly observed by
C. In the mathematical formalism, compatibility is encoded as commutativity.
Both perceptions and emotions are treated as conscious experiences. Quantum
measurement formalism matches perfectly to the Higher Order Theory of Conscious-
ness. Emotions correspond to repeatable contexts and they contextualize perceptions
and other conscious experiences. Emotional coloring reduces state degeneration for
them and makes the information processing less diffuse. Context-matching is also
important for social communication.
One of the main distinguishing features of the quantum measurement theory is
the presence of incompatible, i.e., jointly unobservable entities. In particular, the
presence of incompatible observables makes impossible the use of the classical
probability model (axiomatic of Kolmogorov [318]). The existence of incompat-
ible perceptions or emotions is evident even from our personal experience. This
motivates the use of quantum theory for modeling brain’s self-observations.
To model emotional contextuality, we explore the tensor product formalism by
factorizing the unconscious state space into the tensor product, one of its components
4 We repeat that this model has no direct coupling to study of genuine quantum physical processes
in the brain.

Emotional Coloring of Conscious Experiences
describes the states of emotions. As is well known from quantum physics, the direct
test of contextuality is impossible due to counterfactual nature of its formulation.
The indirect tests of contextuality are based on the Bell-type inequalities. We dis-
cuss the possibility of such tests for pairs (perception, emotion) or (decision-making,
emotion). As in physics, the problem of the interpretation of the violation of Bell
inequalities is very complex. Following [272, 286], we couple violation and observ-
ables incompatibility, i.e., the existence of incompatible perceptions and emotions.
Wehopethat our model canstimulatetheapplications of thequantumformalismin
conscious-studies, especially in modeling perception-emotion and decision-emotion
correlations.

Part III
Quantum Instruments in Psychology
and Decision-Making
This part is devoted to quantum instruments and their applications to psychology and
decision-making. Quantum instruments are the basic tools of the general formalism
for quantum measurements. Quantum instruments describe the state transformations
generated by measurements’ feedback. Such transformations in the space of quantum
states are not reduced to ones based on the projections. State transformations cause
representation of the outcomes’ probabilities by Positive Operator Valued Measures
(POVMs), generalized observables. The latter are often considered as the basic enti-
ties of the modern theory of quantum measurements. However, POVMs are just
byproducts of quantum instruments.
In physics, quantum instruments and, in particular, POVMs appeared at the
advanced stage of theory’s development, mainly, in quantum information theory.
However, as we shall see in this part, quantum-like modeling of cognition and
decision-making demands to proceed with quantum instruments even for the basic
psychological effects; for example, the combination of the question order and
response replicability effects. Here one cannot apply the von Neumann measure-
ment theory with Hermitian operators and projection type state update (see Sect. 14
on the impossibility proof).
The quantum instrument formalism is coupled to open quantum systems theory
through the indirect measurement scheme employing the unitary operator realization
of the interaction between a system and a measurement apparatus.
In this part, we show that, with the quantum instrument formalism, it is possible
to model the combination of the question order and response replicability effects.
We also performed the numerical simulation based on our model to match with data
collected in numerous opinion pools. In contrast to the question order effect, the
response replicability effect has not yet been studied experimentally. May be this
book would stimulate experimental studies on the response replicability effect and
its combination with the question order effect as well as other basic psychological
effects.
We hope that this part of the book would serve as an introduction to quantum
instrument theory for scientists working in mathematical modeling in cognition,
psychology, and decision-making.

By Postulate 2 of quantum theory (Chap.16) an observable a is represented by a
Hermitian operator A which can be represented as
A =

x
x E(x),
(8.1)
where(E(x))isitsspectraldecomposition.Here,foreigenvalue x of A, E(x)denotes

E(x)E(y) = δ(x −y)E(x).
(8.3)
For density operator ρ, the Born rule can be written as
P(a = x|ρ) = Tr[ρE(x)] = Tr[E(x)ρ].
(8.4)
The latter equality is a consequence of the general property of trace, TrC = TrC∗
and, hence, TrM∗N = TrN ∗M, or for Hermitian operators, TrM N = TrN M.
And since any projection is idempotent, i.e., (E(x))2 = E(x), and Hermitian, this
rule can be written as
P(a = x|ρ) = Tr[E(x)ρE(x)].

Here we used cyclic symmetry of the trace operation for Hermitian operators, in
particular,
TrMNK = Tr(MNK)∗= TrKNM = TrMKN.
Hence
Tr[E(x)ρ] = Tr[E(x)E(x)ρ] = Tr[E(x)ρE(x)].
As was pointed out in Chap.1, in quantum-like modeling observables can yield
values belonging to any set
X = {x1, ..., xm}.
(8.6)
Therefore, they are represented not by Hermitian operators, but by spectral families
(E(x))x∈X satisfying two constraints (8.2), (8.3). They guarantee that, for any state
ρ, the quantity determined by the Born rule (8.4) can be interpreted as probability;

x∈X
P(a = x|ρ) = 1.
(8.7)
Such family of projectors (E(x))x∈X determines a projector-valued measure (PVM);
μ(G) =

x∈G
E(x),
(8.8)
where G is a subset of X. It is easy to check that μ(G) is projection, i.e., it is
Hermitian and idempotent:

E(x) = I

and μ is additive. For disjoint sets G1, G2,
μ(G1 ∨G2) = μ(G1) + μ(G2).
(8.10)
Then the probability that observation’s output belongs to set G ∈F is given by the
formula
P(a = x ∈G|ρ) = Tr[ρμ(G)] = Tr[μ(G)ρμ(G)].
(8.11)

8.1 Von Neumann Observables and von Neumann-Lüders Instruments
109
The above consideration can be easily generalized to inﬁnite-dimensional Hilbert
spaces and operators with continuous spectra. In the latter case, the framework of
operator valued measures is fruitful. In the discrete case, one can proceed without it.
So, we have mentioned it only for generality of presentation, and it will not be used
in this book.
In particular, PVMs are generated by commonly used in textbooks quantum
observables given mathematically by Hermitian operators. They were introduced
(at the mathematical level of rigorousness) by von Neumann. And we call such
observables the von Neumann observables. Later we shall consider more general
observables given by POVMs (positive operator valued measures). The von Neu-
mann observables represent exact measurements and generalized observables repre-
sent fuzzy measurements. But, this “exact-fuzzy” interpretation cannot be discussed
without consideration of the process of the state update as measurement’s feedback.
And now we move to this fundamental question.
According to the projection postulate (in the Lüders form, see Chap.16, Sect.16.3)
the post-measurement state is generated by the map:
ψ →ψ{a=x} = E(x)ψ/∥E(x)ψ∥.
(8.12)
This state transformation corresponds to observation’s feedback to the system which
initially was in the state ψ, i.e., observations modify systems’ states. For density
operators, this transformation has the form:
ρ →ρ{a=x} =
E(x)ρE(x)
TrE(x)ρE(x).
(8.13)
We emphasize that representation of the measurement process of observable a by
Hermitian operator A combines in one symbol both outcomes’ statistics (via the Born
rule) and measurement’s feedback on the system’s state (by the projection postulate
in the Lüders form). A Hermitian operator determines the PVM which is used both
in the Born and state update rules.
For an arbitrary PVM, we now introduce the map
I(x)ρ = E(x)ρE(x).
(8.14)
The both rules can be rewritten with this map:
P(a = x|ρ) = TrI(x)ρ
(8.15)
and
ρ →ρ{a=x} =
I(x)ρ
TrI(x)ρ .
(8.16)
This map is simplest example of a quantum instrument, the von Neumann-Lüders
instrument. Mentioning Lüders’ name is important, since, as was pointed out in

110
8
Quantum Instruments and Positive Operator Valued Measures
Chap.16, Sect.16.3, von Neumann declared the projection state update only for mea-
surement processes symbolized by Hermitian operators with nondegenerate spectra.
Some authors treat von Neumann-Lüders measurements as exact, in the follow-
ing meaning: different outcomes generate the state projections on the orthogonal
subspaces. If state |ψ⟩belongs to eigensubspace Hx, then the a-measurement can
produce only the value a = x. Another a-value cannot be obtained for this state;
x is the exact value associated with |ψ⟩.1 For general instruments, the existence of
such states is questionable. Typically the same state generates different outcomes,
and these outcomes form a “fuzzy value” for this state.
The above discussion on “exact-fuzzy” is reﬂection of the important property
of the von Neumann-Lüders instrument, a −a response replicability (observation
repeatability). Suppose the value a = x was obtained and then the a-measurement
was done immediately after the ﬁrst measurement. Then the outcome is again a = x.
Finally,weremarkinthegeneraltheoryofquantuminstruments,thevonNeumann
observables (PVMs) can be generated by instruments which do not need to be of the
von Neumann-Lüders type. In this case, statistics of outcomes is given by the Born
rule (8.4), but the state update is not of the projection form (8.13); it cannot be
mathematically represented by projections.
Since any projection is Hermitian, i.e., (E(x))∗= E(x), we write
I(x)ρ = E(x)ρ(E(x))∗.
(8.17)
To compare PVMs with POVMs, it is convenient to write the normalization con-
dition (8.2) in the form:

x
(E(x))∗E(x) = I.
(8.18)

Davis–Lewis–Ozawa Quantum Instruments
The space L(H) of linear operators in H is a linear space over the complex numbers.
Moreover, L(H) is the complex Hilbert space with the scalar product,
⟨A|B⟩= TrA∗B.
We consider linear operators acting on it; they are called superoperators, i.e.,
T : L(H) →L(H),
T (c1A1 + c2 A2) = c1T A1 + c2T A2,
1 Such interpretation is possible only for eigenstates-states belonging to E(x)-images of H. If a
state is superposition of eigenstates belonging to different subspaces Hx, then a-measurement can
generate various values of a.

where c j ∈C, A j ∈L(H). The latter terminology is used to distinguish operators
acting in the Hilbert spaces H and L(H). Otherwise superoperators are usual linear
operators. In particular, for T : L(H) →L(H), there is well deﬁned its adjoint
operator T ∗: L(H) →L(H), where
⟨T ∗A|B⟩= ⟨A|T B⟩,
i.e.,
Tr(T ∗A)∗B = TrA∗T B.
However, some basic notions are speciﬁc for superoperators.
Positive Versus Completely Positive Superoperators
We present a few mathematical deﬁnitions used in the general theory of state trans-
formations corresponding to measurements. We start with reminder of the notions
of positivity for superoperators (Chap.16).
A superoperator T : L(H) →L(H) is called positive if it maps the set of positive
(semi-deﬁnite) operators into itself, i.e., T (Q) ≥0, for any Q ≥0. Superoperators
are typically applied to quantum states, so positivity implies that, for a density oper-
ator ρ, T ρ ≥0.
A superoperator T : L(H) →L(H) is called completely positive if its natural
extension T ⊗I to the tensor product L(H) ⊗L(M) = L(H ⊗L), where L is an
arbitrary ﬁnite-dimensional complex Hilbert space, i.e., T ⊗I (|ψ⟩|φ⟩) = T |ψ⟩|φ⟩,
is again a positive superoperator on L(H) ⊗L(L).
Complete positivity is the mathematical description of the following physical
statement. Let S be a system with the state space H and let T be a superoperator
mapping states into states. We can always add to S another system, say S′ with state
space M. Assume that systems do not interact. The unit map I : M →M does not
change states of S′. Consider now compound system S = (S, S′). Its state space is
given by the tensor product H ⊗L. It is natural (from the physical viewpoint) that
the superoperator map T ⊗I would map the states of S into its states, i.e., it should
preserve positivity as T does. Adding to consideration another system which does
not interact with the original one cannot change the physical situation and it would
be surprising if a state transformation corresponding to measurement on S would be
impossible to extend identically to the state space of compound system. In terms of
observables violation of complete positivity means that observation on S cannot be
treated as observation on the compound system S.
Complete positivity is a stronger condition than simply positivity. Of course,
the existence of superoperators which are positive, but not completely positive is a
strange mathematical property of the quantum model. Let dim H = dim l = 2 and
let T is the matrix transposition superoperator, T (A) = A∗. Then T is positive

superoperator, but T ⊗I is not positive, it does not map positive 4 × 4 matrices into
positive ones.
Finally, I make the following remark. Although in physics the necessity of com-
plete positivity is commonly accepted, I still have the feeling that its necessity in
quantum-like modeling for cognitive systems can be questioned.
Quantum Instruments: Observation Statistics
and Back-Action
Consider now the general scheme of the measurement process for some (physical or
mental) observable a on system S. This process is characterized by two things:
• (i) the output probability distribution P(a = x|ρ), the probability distribution of
the outputs of a-measurement for the input state ρ.
• (ii) the quantum state reduction ρ →ρ{a=x}, the state change from the input state ρ
to the output state ρ{a=x} conditional upon the outcome a = x of the measurement.
A quantum instrument is any map x →I(x), where for each real x, the map I(x)
is a completely positive superoperator satisfying the normalization condition

x
Tr[I(x)ρ] = 1
for any state ρ. Davies–Lewis [114] only postulated that the superoperator I(x)
should be positive. Then Ozawa [364] introduced complete positivity to ensure that
every quantum instrument is physically realizable.
Given a quantum instrument I, the output probability distribution for the input
state ρ is deﬁned by the generalized Born rule in the trace-form,
P(a = x|ρ) := Tr [I(x)ρ],
(8.19)
and the quantum state reduction is deﬁned by
ρ →ρ{a=x} :=
I(x)ρ
Tr[I(x)ρ].
(8.20)
According to the Kraus theorem (see, e.g., [211, 212]), for any instrument I, there
exists a family {Mx j}x, j of operators, called the measurement operators for I, in H
such that
I(x)ρ =

j
Mx jρM∗
x j
(8.21)
for any state ρ. In this case, we have


x j

x j Mx j = I.
(8.22)
Conversely, any family {Mx j}x, j of operators in H satisfying (8.22) deﬁnes an instru-
ment I.
The possibility to work with representation (8.21) makes quantum instruments of
the Ozawa type, i.e., based on completely positive transformations of the state space,
very convenient for applications.
Thus, the projection postulate is no longer the requirement for the state update.
8.3
Positive Operator Valued Measures
Generalized quantum observables are given by POVMs. We restrict considerations
to POVMs with a discrete domain of deﬁnition X = {x1, ..., xm}. POVM is a map
x →(x).
Here, for each x ∈X, (x) is a positive contractive self-adjoint operator (i.e.,
0 ≤(x) ≤I) (called an effect), and the normalization condition

x
(x) = I
(8.23)
holds, where I is the unit operator. This map deﬁnes an operator valued measure on
algebra F of all subsets of set X. For O ⊂X,
(O) =

x∈O
(x).
The condition (8.23) is the operator-measure counterpart of the condition normal-
ization by 1 for usual probability measures.
We stress that the PVMs form a special class of POVM.
POVM  represents statistics of measurements for an observable a with the
following generalization of Born’s rule:
P(a = x|ρ) = Tr[(x)ρ].
We remark that equality (8.23) implies that 
x P(a = x|ρ) = 1.
POVMs are generalized quantum observables. This is the natural extension of the
class of the von Neumann observables given by PVMs.
POVM does not represent state update. The latter is typically determined
(nonuniquely) via representation of effects in the form:
(x) = V (x)∗V (x),
(8.24)

114
8
Quantum Instruments and Positive Operator Valued Measures
where V (x) is a linear operator in H; a canonical choice is V (x) = (x)1/2 and
every V (x) is of the form V (x) = U(x)(x)1/2 with unitary operators U(x) for any
x by polar decomposition. Hence, similarly to (8.18) the normalization condition has
the form

x
V (x)∗V (x) = I.
(8.25)
The Born rule can be written similarly to (8.5):
P(a = x|ρ) = Tr[V (x)ρV ∗(x)].
(8.26)
It is assumed that the post-measurement state transformation is based on the map
(cf. with (8.17)):
ρ →I(x)ρ = V (x)ρV ∗(x),
(8.27)
so
ρ →ρ{a=x} =
I(x)ρ
Tr[I(x)ρ] =
V (x)ρV ∗(x)
TrV (x)ρV ∗(x).
(8.28)
Now, we remark that the map x →I(x) given by (8.27) is a very special quantum
instrument, known as atomic instrument. An attempt to solve the problem of com-
bination of QOE and RRE with atomic instruments was presented in article [49], it
was shown that (in ﬁnite dimensional case) it cannot be done if RRE is treated (as
in this book) as both sequential combinations, a −b −a and b −a −b.
We would like to elevate the role of the use of quantum instruments, compar-
ing with the use of just POVMs. An instrument provides both statistics of the
measurement-outputs and the rule for the state update, but POVM should always
be endowed with ad hoc condition (8.24).
Finally, we remark that any instrument I, representing mathematically (physical
or mental) observable a, generates POVM  (generalized quantum observable) by
the rule:
(x) = I(x)∗I.
(8.29)
However, its state update does not need to have the form (8.27).
The general form will be given as follows. Recall that any instrument I has a
family {Mx j}x, j of measurement operators satisfying
I(x)ρ =

j
Mx jρM∗
x j.
(8.30)
Then, from Eq.(8.29) the POVM  generated by the instrument I is given by
(x) =

j
M∗
x j Mx j.
(8.31)

8.4 Quantum Instruments from Indirect Measurements

Equation(8.27) determining atomic instruments is a special case of (8.30) where
V (x) = Mx j with j ∈{1}.Ifsum(8.30)containsmorethanoneterm,suchinstrument
is called non-atomic.
This representation is valid for the quantum instruments of the Ozawa type which
we consider in this book, i.e., ones based on the completely positive maps. The
instruments of the Davis-Lewis type generate state updates of a more general form.
The problem of the mathematical description of such state transformations has not
yet been solved.
8.4
Quantum Instruments from Indirect Measurements
Construction of quantum instruments is based on the scheme of indirect measure-
ments. This scheme formalizes the following situation. As was permanently empha-
sized by Bohr (one of the founders of quantum mechanics), the results of quantum
measurements are generated in the process of interaction of a system S with a mea-
surement apparatus M. This apparatus consists of a complex physical device inter-
acting with S and a pointer that shows the result of measurement, say spin up or spin
down. An observer can see only outputs of the pointer and he associates these outputs
with the values of the observable a for the system S. So, the observer approaches
only the pointer, not the system by itself. Whether the outputs of the pointer can
be associated with the “intrinsic properties” of S is one of the main problems of
quantum foundations, it is still a topic for foundational debates.
Thus, the indirect measurement scheme involves:
• the states of the systems S and the apparatus M for measurement of some (physical
or mental) observable a;
• the operator U representing the interaction-dynamics for the system S + M;
• the meter observable Ma giving outputs of the pointer of the apparatus M.
WeshallmakethefollowingremarkontheoperatorU oftheinteraction-dynamics.
Aswithalloperationsinthequantummechanics,itisalinearoperator.Inthequantum
formalism,dynamicsofthestateofanisolatedsystemisdescribedbytheSchrödinger
equation and its evolution operator is unitary. In the indirect measurement scheme,
it is assumed that (approximately) the compound system S + M is isolated. Hence,
its evolution operator U is unitary.
Measuring Process
Formally, an indirect measurement model, introduced in [364] as a “(general) mea-
suring process”, is a quadruple
(K, σ,U, Ma)

116
8
Quantum Instruments and Positive Operator Valued Measures
consisting of a Hilbert space K, a density operator σ ∈D(K), a unitary operator
U on the tensor product of the state spaces of S and M, U : H ⊗K →H ⊗K,
and a self-adjoint operator Ma on K. By this measurement model, the Hilbert space
K describes the states of the apparatus M, the unitary operator U describes the
time-evolution of the composite system S + M, the density operator σ describes the
initial state of the apparatus M, and the self-adjoint operator Ma describes the meter
observable of the apparatus M. Then, the output probability distribution P(a = x|ρ)
in the system state ρ ∈S(H) is given by
P(a = x|ρ) = Tr[(I ⊗E Ma(x))U(ρ ⊗σ)U ∗],
(8.32)
where E Ma(x) is the spectral projection of operator Ma for the eigenvalue x.
The change of the state ρ of the system S caused by the measurement for the
outcome a = x is represented with the aid of the map Ia(x1) in the space of density
operators deﬁned as
Ia(x1)ρ = TrK[(I ⊗E Ma(x))U(ρ ⊗σ)U ∗],
(8.33)
where TrK is the partial trace over K. Then, the map x →Ia(x1) turns out to be
a quantum instrument. Thus, the statistical properties of the measurement realized
by any indirect measurement model (K, σ,U, Ma) is described by a quantum mea-
surement. We remark that conversely any quantum instrument can be represented
via the indirect measurement model [364]. Thus, quantum instruments mathemati-
cally characterize the statistical properties of all the physically realizable quantum
measurements.2
Now we make the following remark on terminology. In the textbook quantum
theory one speaks about observation performed on systems, an observable a is math-
ematically given by Hermitian operator A ∈L(H), where H is the state space of S.
This scheme is straightforward and it does not involve the apparatus’ state space
Probe Subsystem of Measurement Apparatus
Now, we point to a few details which were omitted in the above considerations.
The measuring interaction between the system S and the apparatus M turns on at
time t0, the time of measurement, and turns off at time t = t0 + t. We assume
that the system S and the apparatus M do not interact each other before t0 nor after
t = t0 + t and that the compound system S + M is isolated in the time interval
(t0, t).
Now we detailize the structure of M. The probe system P is deﬁned to be the
minimal part of apparatus M such that the compound system S + P is isolated in
the time interval (t0, t).
Then the above scheme is applied to the probe system P, instead of the whole
apparatus M. The rest of the apparatus M performs the pointer measurement on the

8.4 Quantum Instruments from Indirect Measurements
117
probe P. In particular, the unitary evolution operator U describing the state-evolution
of the system S + P has the form H = e−it H, where
H = HS + HP + HSP
is Hamiltonian of S + P with the terms HS and HP representing the internal dynam-
ics in the subsystems S and P of the compound system and HSP describing the
interaction between the subsystems.
Introduction of probe systems may be seen as unnecessary complication of the
scheme of indirect measurements. However, it is useful if the apparatus M is a
very complex system that interacts (often in parallel) with many systems Sj, j =
1, 2, ...., m. Its different probes are involved solely in interaction with the concrete
systems, Pj with Sj. And the system Sj + Pj can be considered as an isolated system;
in particular, from interactions with other systems Si and probes Pi.
In applications to modeling psychological effects (Chaps.9 and 10) we shall oper-
ate with probe system P and Hilbert space K is its state space.
The indirect measurement scheme is part of the theory of open quantum systems.
Insteadof ameasurement apparatus M,wecanconsider thesurroundingenvironment
E of the system S.
Von Neumann Versus Generalized Observables
Some quantum instruments can generate quantum observables of the von Neumann
type, i.e., formula (8.29) gives (x) = E(x), where E = (E(x)) is PVM, see deter-
mining conditions (2.15) and (2.16) (Sect.2.1). The latter condition is important.
POVMs can be of the projection type, but with projections which are not mutually
orthogonal, as, for example, informationally complete POVMs which are widely
used by QBists.
We stress that
A quantum instrument producing an observable of the von Neumann type does
not need to generate the state update of the projection type.
So, a quantum observable can be given by PVM (or Hermitian operator), but
the corresponding state updates can essentially vary. Thus, an observable of the von
Neumann type can be generated by instrument which is not of the von Neumann-
Lüders type. The Born rule has the form (8.4), or (8.5), but state update is not
projection. In our modeling of QOE+RRE, we shall work with such instruments.
In some sense, this is the minimal extension of the textbook quantum measurement
theory.
Consider now observable a given by Hermitian operator A. We shall often say
that “quantum instrument measures observable A.”

Naimark Theorem
The indirect measurement scheme describes coupling of POVMs observables with
“usual PVM” observables: a POVM on the state space H of a system can be repre-
sented as the image of PVM on the state space K of a measurement device. Similar
statement is given in the Naimark theorem.
Theorem 8.1 Let H be the Hilbert state space of a system S and let  = ((x))
be L(H)-valued POVM on X. There exists a Hilbert space K, a bounded linear
operator V : K →H, and L(K)-valued PVM M = (M(x)) on X, such that
(B) = V M(B)V ∗

for any subset B of X.

Replicability Effects
9.1
Quantum Instruments for Questions
As was pointed out in Chap.1, the question order effect (QOE) is one of the basic
psychological effects. It was observed, e.g., in a plenty of social opinion polls [359,
452]. Wang and Busemeyer suggested to model QOE by using quantum measurement
theory. They used the von Neumann formalism [452]. However, as was shown in
article [262], this formalism is not applicable to the combination of QOE with the
response replicability effect (RRE).
In this chapter, we follow the paper of Ozawa and Khrennikov [369] in which
the problem of modeling of the combination QOE+RRE was solved in the frame-
work of quantum instrument theory.1 The construction suggested in [369] can be
extended to any combination of psychological effects. We can add one more belief
state and the personality state corresponding to each new question. (Here a psycho-
logical effect denotes the way of responding questions). The state space covering
all imaginable psychological and social effects may be inﬁnite dimensional. But, we
shall not proceed so far and restrict our considerations to pairs of effects.
Now we represent two observables (questions) a and b not by Hermitian operators
and corresponding projection state update, but by two quantum instruments Ia and
Ib. In the instrumental framework, it is convenient to operate with density operator
representation of states. Let ρ be a density operator. For the state given by ρ, the
sequential joint probability distribution is given by
Pab(α, β|ρ) ≡P(a = α|ρ)P(b = β|a = α; ρ) = Tr Ib(β)Ia(α)ρ.
(9.1)
and

in the series of discussions during the visit of Andrei Khrennikov to the Nagoya University in 2018.

Pba(β, α|ρ) ≡P(b = β|ρ)P(a = α|b = β; ρ) = Tr Ia(α)Ib(β)ρ.
(9.2)
In the Hermitian operator formalism, the crucial role was played by noncommu-
tativity of operators; in the quantum instrument formalism, the basic condition for
exhibition of QOE is noncommutativity of superoperators representing the state
transformations:
[Ib(β), Ia(α)] ̸= 0.
(9.3)
ConsidernowinstrumentsinducingvonNeumannobservablesgivenbyHermitian
operators A and B. But, for the moment these instruments need not be of the von
Neumann-Lüders type (see Sect.8.4). One has to distinguish noncommutativity of
observables and noncommutativity of instruments. The standard noncommutativity
condition
[A, B] ̸= 0,
(9.4)
describes incompatibility of observables, in the sense that their joint probability dis-
tribution (JPD), the JPD for their simultaneous measurements, is not well deﬁned. So,
condition (9.4) is related to joint measurements, not to sequential measurement and
not to QOE. The latter is characterized not via non-existence of JPD, but via noncom-
mutativity of the state updates, formalized via condition (9.3). Generally, noncom-
mutativity of instruments (9.3) does not imply noncommutativity of the observables
(9.4), whereas the converse statement holds as shown in the following theorem. Its
proof is rather technical and the reader who are not so much interested in details of
using quantum formalism can simply jump over this proof.
Theorem 9.1 Let Ia and Ib be instruments of the von Neumann-Lüders type corre-
spondingtoHermitianoperators A and B.Thencommutativityofinstrumentsimplies
commutativity of operators, i.e., if [Ia(x1), Ib(y)] = 0 for any x, y then [A, B] = 0.

Proof Consider the spectral families (Ea(x)) and (Eb(y)) of operators A and B.
Then
Ia(x)∗X = T ∗

By [364, Proposition 4.4]
[T ∗
a (X), Ea(x)] = 0, [T ∗
b (Y), Eb(y)] = 0
for all X, Y ∈L(H) and x, y.

9.2 Questions as Indirect Measurements
121
Suppose that Ia(x)Ib(y) −Ib(y)Ia(x) = 0 for every x, y. Then, we have
Ia(x)∗Ib(y)∗I = Ib(y)∗Ia(x)∗I, Ia(x)∗Eb(y) = Ib(y)∗Ea(x).
Summing up all y we have
Ia(x)∗I = T ∗
b (Ea(x)), Ea(x) = T ∗
b (Ea(x)).
From [T ∗
b (Y), Eb(y)] = 0 we have [Ea(x), Eb(y)] = 0 for all x, y. Thus,
[A, B] = 0.
We shall in fact construct instruments Ia and Ib representing von Neumann
observables A and B, i.e., these instruments generate POVMs which are PVMs,
showing QOE with commuting observables A and B, while the commutativity of
A and B is necessary for Ia and Ib to show RRE. Of course, these are not von
Neumann-Lüders instruments, i.e., they generate state updates which are not projec-
tions.
Now we turn to RRE. In quantum instrument terms, it has the form
1. (a-a): 
a Tr[Ia(x)Ia(x)ρ] = 1 for any density operator ρ.
2. (b-b): 
b Tr[Ib(y)Ib(y)ρ] = 1 for any density operator ρ.
3. (a-b-a): 
a,b Tr[Ia(x)Ib(y)Ia(x)ρ] = 1 for any density operator ρ.
4. (b-a-b): 
a,b Tr[Ib(y)Ia(x)Ib(y)ρ] = 1 for any density operator ρ.

Questions as Indirect Measurements
9.2.1
Von Neumann Observables for Questions
In coming application of the indirect measurement scheme (Chap.8), the system S
is decision maker (human being, say Alice). Measurement apparatus M is a “system
asking questions and registering the answers.” This can be a ﬁrm doing a social
opinion poll. To fulﬁll the assumption of compound system isolation, it is useful
to operate with as part of M called probe and denoted P.2 So, compound system
S + P is treated as an isolated system. For the example of social opinion poll, P is
the concrete agent asking questions to Alice or the computer-based questionnaire.
Here M is a polling ﬁrm collecting information from its agents.
Consider system’s state space H with the basis
{|00⟩, |01⟩, |10⟩, |11⟩}.
This is two qubit space; in the coordinate representation H = C2 ⊗C2. This is the
state space of Alice’s believes about possible answers to two given questions a and
2 This terminology is from quantum physics and may be it is not so natural for cognitive modeling.

b. They are represented by projections A and B on a Hilbert space H. The eigenvalue
1 means the answer “yes” to the questions, and the eigenvalue 0 means the answer
“no” to the questions.
It has to be emphasized that we consider the case where projections A and B
commute. Denote by I1 and I2 the identity operators on the ﬁrst and the second qubit
in H. We set
A = |1⟩⟨1| ⊗I2, B = I1 ⊗|1⟩⟨1|.
IthastobestressedthathereweconsiderAlice’sbelieves.Thustheﬁrstandsecond
quibits encode believes of “no” = 0 and “yes” = 1 to questions a and b, respectively.
We remark that, e.g., ﬁrst quibit can be in superposition |φ⟩= c0|0⟩+ c1|1⟩, so
Alice’s state of mind is superposition of two possible answers to question a. The same
can be said about the second quibit. Moreover, Alice’s brain can generate entangled
states, as say |ψ⟩= (|00⟩+ |11⟩)/
√
2. For this state, Alice is in superposition to
answer “no” or “yes” to both questions.
The crucial point is that to have believes about something does not mean to answer
exactly in accordance with them. By participating, e.g., in a social opinion poll, Alice
would interact with say an agent asking questions and the context, including her own
situation. So, if, e.g., she is in the state |00⟩it does not mean that she would reply
a = 0, b = 0 to the questions a, b.
9.2.2
Quantum a-Instrument
We construct an instrument Ia measuring A as follows. The instrument Ia carries
out a measurement of a by a measuring interaction between the system S (say Alice)
described by the state space H and the probe P described by the state space K with
the basis {|00⟩, |01⟩, |10⟩, |11⟩}. This is also two qubit space.
Denote by I3 and I4 the identity operators on the ﬁrst and the second qubit in K =
C2 ⊗C2. The time evolution of the composite system S + P during the measuring
interaction is described by a unitary operator Ua on H ⊗K satisfying3
Ua : |00⟩|00⟩
→|01⟩|00⟩,
(9.5)
Ua : |01⟩|00⟩
→|01⟩|01⟩,
(9.6)
Ua : |10⟩|00⟩
→|10⟩|10⟩,
(9.7)
Ua : |11⟩|00⟩
→|10⟩|11⟩.
(9.8)
We remark that the interaction operator copies the belief state of Alice to the state
of observer P. What does happen with the belief state? The value in its ﬁrst register
3 It is easy to see that there exists at least one unitary operator Ua on H ⊗K satisfying the given rela-
tions, since the relations deﬁne a one-to-one correspondence between two subsets of the orthonormal
basis {|α, β, γ, δ⟩| α, β, γ, δ = 0, 1} of H ⊗K.

(a-register) is preserved, but the value in its second register (b-register) is changed
to the opposite to the value in the ﬁrst register. We shall come back to this issue later,
by commenting formulas (9.17), (9.18): the state update resulting in outputs a = 0
and a = 1, respectively.
The outcome of the measurement is obtained by measuring the meter observable
Ma = |1⟩⟨1| ⊗I4
(9.9)
of the probe P, i.e., measuring the ﬁrst qubit of K. Note that both A and Ma have the
same spectrum {0, 1} and they are projections. Suppose that the probe P is prepared in
the state |00⟩just before the measuring interaction, the measuring process described
by (K, |00⟩,Ua, Ma) deﬁnes the instrument Ia by
Ia(0)ρ = TrK[(IH ⊗M⊥
a )Ua(ρ ⊗|00⟩⟨00|)U ∗
a (IH ⊗M⊥
a )],
(9.10)
Ia(1)ρ = TrK[(IH ⊗Ma)Ua(ρ ⊗|00⟩⟨00|)U ∗
a (IH ⊗Ma)]
(9.11)
for any density operator ρ on H, where TrK stands for the partial trace over K,
where IH stands for the identity operator on H, i.e., IH = I1 ⊗I2, and where M⊥
a
is the orthogonal complement of the projection Ma, i.e., M⊥
a = IK −Ma, where
IK = I3 ⊗I4.
The measurement described by the instrument Ia determines the probability dis-
tribution P(a = x|ρ) of the outcomes of a-measurement, where x = 0, 1, and the
state change ρ 
→ρ{a=x} caused by the measurement by
P(a = x|ρ) = Tr[Ia(x)ρ],
(9.12)
ρ 
→ρ{a=x} =

Tr[Ia(x)ρ].
(9.13)
Suppose that the system’s state |ψ⟩just before the measurement is arbitrary pure
state, i.e.,
|ψ⟩=

α,β
cα,β|α, β⟩.
Then, by the Born formula we have
P(a = 0|ψ) = ||A⊥|ψ⟩||2 = |c00|2 + |c01|2,
(9.14)
P(a = 1|ψ) = ||A|ψ⟩|2 = |c10||2 + |c11|2.
(9.15)
By the linearity of Ua,
Ua : |ψ⟩|00⟩
→c0,0|01⟩|00⟩+ c0,1|01⟩|01⟩+ c1,0|10⟩|10⟩+ c1,1|10⟩|11⟩, (9.16)
and we have

P(Ma = 0| Ua|ψ⟩|00⟩) = ||(IH ⊗M⊥
a )Ua|ψ⟩|00⟩||2 = |c00|2 + |c01|2,
P(Ma = 1| Ua|ψ⟩|00⟩) = ||(IH ⊗Ma)Ua|ψ⟩|00⟩||2 = |c10|2 + |c11|2.
This shows
P(Ma = 0| Ua|ψ⟩|00⟩) = P(a = 0| |ψ⟩),
P(Ma = 1| Ua|ψ⟩|00⟩) = P(a = 1| |ψ⟩)
for any state |ψ⟩in H. It follows that the instrument Ia measures the observable A,
i.e.,
P(a = 0|ρ) = Tr[Ia(0)ρ] = Tr[A⊥ρ],
P(a = 1|ρ) = Tr[Ia(1)ρ] = Tr[Aρ]
for any density operator ρ on H.
To derive the state change caused by the measurement, suppose that the observer
measures the meter observable Ma just after the measuring interaction. Then, by
(9.10) we have
(IH ⊗M⊥
a )Ua|ψ⟩|00⟩= c0,0|01⟩|00⟩+ c0,1|01⟩|01⟩
and hence
Ia(0)|ψ⟩⟨ψ| = |c0,0|2|01⟩⟨01| + |c0,1|2|01⟩⟨01|
= |01⟩⟨00|ψ⟩⟨ψ|00⟩⟨01| + |01⟩⟨01|ψ⟩⟨ψ|01⟩⟨01|
= Tr[A⊥|ψ⟩⟨ψ|]|01⟩⟨01|.
By the linearity of Ia(0), we conclude
Ia(0)ρ = Tr[A⊥ρ]|01⟩⟨01|
for any density operator ρ on H. Similarly, we have
Ia(1)ρ = Tr[Aρ]|10⟩⟨10|.
Thus, the state change caused by the measurement is given by
ρ 
→ρ{a=0} =
Ia(0)ρ
Tr[Ia(0)ρ] = |01⟩⟨01|,
(9.17)
ρ 
→ρ{a=1} =
Ia(1)ρ
Tr[Ia(1)ρ] = |10⟩⟨10|.

9.2 Questions as Indirect Measurements
125
Thus a = 0-output generates mapping of all belief states into the state |01⟩⟨01|
and a = 1-output maps all belief states into |10⟩⟨10|. The ﬁrst qubit register gives
the output of a-measurement and the second one gives the opposite value.
Consider the Clinton–Gore opinion poll (see paper [359] for poll’s detail and
collected statistical data; see also Chap.1):
• a = “Is Bill Clinton honest and trustworthy?”
• b = “Is Al Gore honest and trustworthy?”
By denying that Bill Clinton honest and trustworthy, Alice comes to the belief that Al
Gore honest and trustworthy and by saying that Bill Clinton honest and trustworthy,
she comes to belief that Al Gore is not honest and trustworthy (for any initial state).
Behavior is not so unusual, but deﬁnitely too simple to match the real human behavior.
However, this simple model works well to represent mathematically the combination
QOE+RRE. However, to match the real data we have to consider a more realistic
behavior such that answering feedback depends nontrivially on the personality of
decision maker (see Chap.10).
9.2.3
Quantum Algorithm for Decision-Making
We now make the remark about the interaction operator Ua. It was deﬁned only
for a part of basis vectors having the K component |00⟩. And we shall consider
the measurement process corresponding to this state vector of P. It is clear that the
interaction operator can be deﬁned for other vectors in the variety of ways. Hence,
different interaction generate the same measurement process |00⟩as P′s state. The
variety of the interaction operators can be interpreted as expressing individuality of
decision makers.
It may be that decision makers mainly use special unitary interactions matching
natural algebra. For dichotomous questions, this is mod 2 arithmetic,4 say as follows:
According to the above equations, the basis vector |a, b, 0, 0⟩= |ab⟩|00⟩, a, b =
0, 1, is transformed to |a, a + 1, a, b⟩, where + means the addition modulo 2. This
can be extended to the one-to-one transformation
|a, b, c, d⟩
→|c + a, d + a + 1, a, b⟩
for all basis vectors. Thus, there is a way to extend Ua to be a unitary transformation,
which can be, in fact, realized by a quantum circuit:
The map |a, c⟩
→|c + a, a⟩is realized by
• |a, c⟩– CNOT 
→|a, c + a⟩,
• |a, d⟩– CNOT 
→|a, d + a⟩– NOT on the second qubit 
→|a, d + a + 1⟩.
4 This is the good place to mention the p-adic and, in particular, 2-adic models of brain’s functioning
[127, 229, 243].

126

Question Order and Response Replicability Effects
Thus,
|a, b, c, d⟩
→|a, b, c + a, d + a + 1⟩.
• By SWAP |a, b⟩and |c + a, d + a + 1⟩we obtain the circuit realizing |a, b, c, d⟩

→|c + a, d + a + 1, a, b⟩.
(This circuit is classical in the sense that it can be realized as Boolean circuits.)
Now the natural question arises:
Does the brain (Alice’s brain) really performs quantum computation and the inter-
action operation U is algorithmically composed of quantum circuits or the brain
directly generates the integral interaction operator?5
In the quantum computing paradigm, the brain uses quantum algorithms which
it combines from quantum gates, so it uses quantum logic for decision-making.
Personally, I am not in favor of this paradigm for the brain functioning. I guess that
the brain is a kind of analogous device realizing the interaction operators. For the
moment, we can only speculate...
Generally this is an interesting topic (at least mathematically)—quantum algo-
rithmic realization of the U-operators for concrete problems of decision-making.
9.2.4
Quantum b-Instrument
The instrument Ib is constructed with the same probe system P prepared in the
state |00⟩. The unitary operator Ub on H ⊗K, describing the time evolution of the
composite system S + P during the measuring interaction, is supposed to satisfy
Ub : |00⟩|00⟩
→|10⟩|00⟩,
(9.19)
Ub : |01⟩|00⟩
→|01⟩|01⟩,
(9.20)
Ub : |10⟩|00⟩
→|10⟩|10⟩,
(9.21)
Ub : |11⟩|00⟩
→|01⟩|11⟩,
(9.22)
and the meter observable on K is given by
Mb = I3 ⊗|1⟩⟨1|.
(9.23)
Then the instrument Ib of this measuring process (K, |00⟩,Ub, Mb) is deﬁned by
5 The easiest way to model this situation is to consider the brain as self-observer: consciousness C
performs observations on unconsciousness C [268].

P(b = 1|ρ) = Tr[Ib(1)ρ] = Tr[Bρ],

Combination of Order and Response Replicability
Effects
In what follows we shall show that instruments Ia and Ib constructed in the previous
sections within the indirect measurement framework represent both RRE and QOE.
Theorem 9.2 The instruments Ia and Ib describe RRE; for any density operator ρ
they satisfy the following relations:
(i) 
x Tr[Ia(x)Ia(x)ρ] = 1,
(ii) 

Thus, relation (i) follows, and relation (ii) follows similarly. For any density operator

Consequently,

Tr[Ia(x)Ib(y)Ia(x)ρ] = Tr[A⊥ρ] + Tr[Aρ]

Thus, relation (iii) follows, and relation (iv) follows similarly.

Theorem 9.3 The instruments Ia and Ib generate QOE, namely, we have the fol-
lowing statements.
(i) For any ψ = 
α,β cα,β|α, β⟩the relation
Tr[Ib(0)Ia(1)|ψ⟩⟨ψ|] = Tr[Ia(1)Ib(0)|ψ⟩⟨ψ|]

holds if and only if |c00|2 = |c11|2.
(iii) Both Eqs.(9.26) and (9.27) hold only on a set of state vectors |ψ⟩with Lebesgue
measure 0.

Proof We have
Tr[Ib(0)Ia(1)|ψ⟩⟨ψ|] = Tr[A|ψ⟩⟨ψ|]Tr[Ib(0)|10⟩⟨10|]
= ⟨ψ|A|ψ⟩
= |c10|2 + |c11|2,

ψ|B⊥|ψ

= ⟨ψ|B|ψ⟩
= |c01|2 + |c11|2.
Thus, assertion (ii) holds. Assertion (iii) follows easily from the above statements.
9.3.1
Stability of Question Order Effect
If QOE holds for any state |ψ⟩(we considered only pure states), then it is stable if it
holds in some small neighborhood Wϵ(|ψ⟩), in the Hilbert space metric.

Theorem 9.4 If QOE is valid for a state |ψ⟩, then QOE is also valid in its small
neighborhood.
□
Proof By Theorem 9.3 the states for which QOE are not valid form a closed set, and
hence the QOE is valid on an open set of states, so that the assertion follows.
9.3.2
Non-atomicity of Instruments
Note that quantum instruments Ia and Ib can be represented as
Ia(0)ρ = |01⟩⟨00|ρ|00⟩⟨01| + |01⟩⟨01|ρ|01⟩⟨01|.
Ia(1)ρ = |10⟩⟨10|ρ|10⟩⟨10| + |10⟩⟨11|ρ|11⟩⟨10|.
Ib(0)ρ = |10⟩⟨00|ρ|00⟩⟨10| + |10⟩⟨10|ρ|10⟩⟨10|.
Ib(1)ρ = |01⟩⟨01|ρ|01⟩⟨01| + |01⟩⟨11|ρ|11⟩⟨01|.
They are not atomic in the sense of Eq.(8.27).
If Ia(1)ρ = VρV ∗, then M = V ∗V . Since the range of VρV ∗is spanned by |01⟩,
V is of rank one, and so is M = V ∗V . This is contradiction, since A = M, i.e.,
Tr[Aρ] = Tr[Mρ] for all ρ, and A = |1⟩⟨1| ⊗I is of rank two.
Thus, the construction presented in this chapter matches the result of article [49].
We have shown that the quantum formalism is consistent with the combination of
two fundamental psychological effects: QOE and RRE. Thus the objection presented
in article [262] and challenged applications of this formalism to psychology was
eliminated.6
Before publication of the paper pf Ozawa and Khrennikov [369], the situation was
really alarming! (Although this alarm signal was generally ignored by the majority
of newcomers to quantum-like modeling, the experts understood well that the project
of quantum decision-making can collapse.) The authors of paper [262] showed that
the straightforward application of the quantum formalism, i.e., the attempt to proceed
with representation of observables by Hermitian operators is incompatible with some
natural constraints generated by humans’ psychological behavior. The ﬁrst attempt to
appeal to more general quantum models with atomic instruments was not successful
[49]-the same no-go result as in paper [262]. In article [369], this problem was
resolved by using non-atomic quantum instruments. Thus, the quantum psychology
project was saved (well, may be just for a while...). Finally, we remark that the use
non-atomic instruments are not so common in genuine quantum physics. An appeal
to them was really counter-intuitive and the positive solution of the problem was
unexpected.
6 This is the good place to make the following remark. One can be curious whether borrowing the
quantum probability formalism from physics would not lead to paradoxes similar to the paradoxes
generated by using the classical probability formalism in decision-making.

9.3 Combination of Order and Response Replicability Effects
131
Thus, to combine QOE and RRE, one has to consider the general quantum
measurement theory based on quantum (non-atomic) instruments–the operational
approach. It is impossible to proceed with measurements of the projection type.
The essence of the operational approach is treatment of systems as interacting with
the environment (theory of open quantum systems). In psychology, this is “mental
environment”.
By resolving the concrete problem of quantum-like modeling of QOE and RRE,
we should be cautious by using quantum-like modeling in psychology. There is a
plenty of other psychological effects. One has to be sure that their combination is
covered by theory of quantum instruments. It seems that the following construction
should work: adding the tensor product of two quibit state spaces for each psycho-
logical effect formulated in the form of a “yes”-“no” question. But, this construction
leads to extension of the state space. The natural question arises:
Can the problem of combination of all possible psychological effects can be solved
in a ﬁnite dimensional state space?

Psychological Effects and QQ-equality
10.1
Question Order and Response Replicability Effects
and QQ-equality
In this chapter, we present generalization of the quantum-like model developed in
Chap.9. The main attention will be paid to the following problems:
• Combination of the question order and response replicability effects (QOE and
RRE) with the QQ-equality (QQE) (see Wang and Busemeyer [452]).
• Matching of our theoretical model with experimental statistical data collected in
numerous social experiments [359, 452, 453].
• Embedding of the Wang–Busemeyer system of decision-making postulates [452]
in quantum instrument theory.
• Detailed analysis of the structure of the belief and personality states of decision
makers, interpretation of these states and the role of their structure in matching of
theory and experiment.
This chapter is based on the paper of Ozawa and Khrennikov [370] (continuing
the research started in article [369]). We repeat that already the model from article
[369] covered the combination of QOE and RRE with QQE, but we did not want
to shadow modeling of QOE + RRE by consideration of the additional problem,
combining QOE + RRE and QQE.
We also stress that the key psychological effect which led to questioning of appli-
cability of quantum theory to decision-making is RRE. As was shown in [262], QOE
peacefully coexists with QQE, but addition of RRE is the disturbing factor, even for
QOE alone. In psychology and cognitive science, QOE is well known and it deserved
a plenty of theoretical and experimental studies [359]. However, before paper [262]
RRE was not even discussed in psychology, cognition, decision-making. Surpris-
ingly its role was highlighted only in connection with quantum-like modeling. In
particular, there were no experiments on RRE. We hope that the importance of RRE
in quantum-like modeling may stimulate interest to its theoretical analysis and exper-
imental studies. It seems that RRE plays the crucial role in decision-making. We can

mention only one experimental study of RRE [92]. However, the interpretation of
the result presented in article [92] is controversial and it led to intensive exchange by
opinions between Basieva, Dzhafarov, and Khrennikov and Wang and Busemeyer
[52, 93, 138, 274, 275].
10.1.1
Observables, Belief and Personality States
As in Chap.9, in modeling successive question-response experiments, such as the
Clinton–Gore experiment, we consider two questions a and b for a subject to answer
“yes” (y) or “no” (n) and consider the joint probability P(a = x1, b = x2) for obtain-
ing the answer x1 = y, n for the question a and the answer x2 = y, n for the question
b, if the question b is asked after the question a, and the analogous joint probability
P(b = x2, a = x1) if the question a is asked after the question b.
We model the above joint probability distributions by the joint probability distri-
butions of outcomes of successive measurements of 2-valued observables a and b in
a quantum system in a given state ρ in the a–b order and in the b–a order. Accord-
ing to the general quantum measurement theory, the joint probability distributions
are well deﬁned by two 2-valued observables (represented by projections) a, b in a
ﬁxed Hilbert space H, a quantum state ρ, and an a-measuring instrument Ia and a
b-measuring instrument Ib by the relations
P(a = x1, b = x2) ≡P(a = x1, b = x2|ρ) = Tr[Ib(x2)Ia(x1)ρ],
P(b = x2, a = x1) ≡P(b = x2, a = x1|ρ) = Tr[Ia(x1)Ib(x2)ρ].
(10.1)
Let A and B be projections on a Hilbert space H. They correspond to ques-
tions labeled a and b, respectively. The eigenvalue 1 means the answer “yes” to the
questions, and the eigenvalue 0 means the answer “no” to the questions.
Let C2 = {|0⟩, |1⟩} (quibit space) and C3 = {|0⟩, |1⟩, |2⟩} (qutrit space).1
Let H = H1 ⊗H2 ⊗H3 such that H1 = H2 = C2 and H3 = C3. The space H
is called the space of mind states, the ﬁrst component H1 is called the space of belief
states for question a, the second component H2 is called the space of belief states for
question b, the third component is called the space of personality states. The latter is
the new component of the model which was absent in the simpler model of Chap.9.
Denote by I1, I2, and I3 the identity operators on the ﬁrst, second, and the third
component of H, respectively. We let A = |1⟩⟨1| ⊗I2 ⊗I3, and B = I1 ⊗|1⟩⟨1| ⊗
I3. Thus, we consider the case where projections A and B commute (as was also in
Chap.9).
1 We remark that qutrit spaces are not so often used in quantum physics; typically one considers
the tensor product of a few qubit spaces.

10.1.2
Instrument Measuring a-Observable
We construct an instrument Ia measuring a as follows. The instrument Ia carries
out a measurement of a by a measuring interaction between the system S described
by the state space H and the probe P described by the state space K = C2 ⊗C2,
which is prepared in the state |00⟩just before the measuring interaction. Denote by
I4 and I5 the identity operators on the ﬁrst and second components of K. For the
composite system S + P, its state transformation during the measuring interaction
is described by a unitary operator Ua on H ⊗K satisfying
Ua : |000⟩|00⟩→|000⟩|00⟩,
(10.2)
Ua : |010⟩|00⟩→|010⟩|01⟩,
(10.3)
Ua : |100⟩|00⟩→|100⟩|10⟩,
(10.4)
Ua : |110⟩|00⟩→|110⟩|11⟩,

Ua : |001⟩|00⟩→|011⟩|00⟩,

Ua : |011⟩|00⟩→|011⟩|01⟩,
(10.7)
Ua : |101⟩|00⟩→|101⟩|10⟩,

Ua : |002⟩|00⟩→|002⟩|00⟩,
(10.10)
Ua : |012⟩|00⟩→|002⟩|01⟩,
(10.11)
Ua : |102⟩|00⟩→|112⟩|10⟩,
(10.12)
Ua : |112⟩|00⟩→|112⟩|11⟩,
(10.13)
and the outcome of the measurement is obtained by measuring the meter observable
Ma = |1⟩⟨1| ⊗I5
(10.14)
of the probe P. Note that both A and MA have the same spectrum {0, 1} and they are
projections. We denote by IH and IK the identity operators on H and K, respectively,
and denote by M⊥
a the orthogonal complement of the projection Ma, i.e., M⊥
a =
IK −Ma.
Equations(10.2)–(10.5) describe the change of the mind state + the probe state
with the personality state |0⟩. In this case, the belief state is copied to the probe state
and the belief state does not change. Thus, in the decision stage, measuring the ﬁrst
state of the probe state results in the decision equal to the belief for question A just
before the question-response process.
Equations(10.6)–(10.9) describe the change of the mind state + the probe state
with the personality state |1⟩. In this case, the belief state is copied to the probe state
as well but the belief state for question b changes if the belief states for question a
and question b are equal. The decision stage results in the preset belief for question
a as well.

Psychological Effects and QQ-equality
Equations(10.10)–(10.13) describe the change of the mind state + the probe state
with the personality state |2⟩. In this case, the belief state is copied to the probe state
as well but the belief state for question b changes if the belief states for question
a and question b are not equal. The decision stage results in the preset belief for
question a as well.
The variables for a-outcomes and b-outcomes will be denoted as x1 and x2, respec-
tively.
Suppose that the probe P is prepared in the state |00⟩just before the measuring
interaction, the measuring process described by the indirect measurement model
(K, |00⟩,Ua, Ma) deﬁnes the instrument Ia by
Ia(x1)ρ = TrK

,
(10.15)
for any density operator ρ on H, where TrK stands for the partial trace over K
and E Ma(x1) denotes the spectral projection of an observable Ma for a = x1, i.e.,
E Ma(0) = M⊥
a and E Ma(1) = Ma. Consequently,
Ia(0)ρ = TrK[(IH ⊗M⊥
a )Ua(ρ ⊗|00⟩⟨00|)U ∗
a (IH ⊗M⊥
a )],
Ia(1)ρ = TrK[(IH ⊗Ma)Ua(ρ ⊗|00⟩⟨00|)U ∗
a (IH ⊗Ma)]
(10.16)
for any ρ.
The instrument Ia determines the probability distribution P(a = x1|ρ) of the
outcome x1 = 0, 1 of the a-measurement, and the state change ρ →ρ{a=x1} caused
by the measurement is determined by
P(a = x1|ρ) = Tr[Ia(x1)ρ],
(10.17)
ρ →ρ{a=x1} =
Ia(x1)ρ
Tr[Ia(x1)ρ].
(10.18)
The instrument Ia measures the observable A, i.e.,
P(a = 0|ρ) = Tr[Ia(0)ρ] = Tr[A⊥ρ],
P(a = 1|ρ) = Tr[Ia(1)ρ] = Tr[Aρ].
(10.19)
The proof can be found in (open access) paper [370] (in appendix).

The instrument Ib is constructed with the same probe system P prepared in the state
|00⟩in an analogous manner with the instrument Ia. The unitary operator Ub on
H ⊗K, describing the time evolution of the composite system S + P during the

10.2
Generalization of Wang–Busemeyer Postulates
Our model presented above satisﬁes the following postulates.
Postulate 1QL: A subject’s mind state is represented by a state vector in or a
density operator on a multidimensional feature space (technically, an N-dimensional
Hilbert space).
The above postulate extends Postulate 1 in Wang–Busemeyer [452] to include
density operators. State vectors |ψ j⟩can be mixed in two ways. For complex numbers
α j with 
j |α j|2 = 1, we can make a new state vector, called the superposition,

j α j|ψ j⟩, and alternatively for positive numbers p j with 
j p j = 1, we can make
a new state, called the mixture, represented by the density operator 
j p j|ψ j⟩⟨ψ j|.
We use density operators if the state is a probability mixture (not a superposition) of
state vectors.
Postulate 2QL: A potential response to a question is represented by a subspace
of the multidimensional feature space.
This repeats Postulate 2 in [452]. In our model, we consider two questions a and
b corresponding to the two subspaces HA and HB, which are represented by the two
projections A and B that project the whole space H onto HA and HB, respectively.
Postulate 3QL: The probability of responding to an opinion question equals the
squared length of the projection of the state vector onto the response subspace, or
equals the trace of the projection of the density operator onto the response subspace.
This extends Postulate 3 in [452] to include density operators. According to
Eq.(10.19), in our model the probability that a subject in a state vector |ψ⟩responds
“yes” or “no” to the opinion question a is given by
P(a = y|ψ⟩) = ||A|ψ⟩||2,
P(a = n|ψ⟩) = ||A⊥|ψ⟩||2.
(10.37)
From Eq.(10.36) analogous relations hold for question b. According to Eq.(10.19,
for the ensemble of subjects represented by a density operator ρ the frequency of
responses “yes” or “no” to the opinion question a is given by

10.2 Generalization of Wang–Busemeyer Postulates
139
P(a = y|ρ) = Tr[Aρ] = Tr[Aρ A],
P(a = n|ρ) = Tr[A⊥ρ] = Tr[A⊥ρ A⊥].
(10.38)
From Eq.(10.36) analogous relations hold for question b.
Postulate 4: The updated mind state after deciding an answer to a question is
determined by the instrument corresponding to the question.
This postulate is more general than Postulate 4 in [452]. According to Eqs.(8.21)
and (8.22) for any A-measuring instrument Ia, there exists a family {M1 j, M0 j} j of
operators such that
Ia(1)ρ =

j
M1 jρM∗
1 j,
(10.39)
A =

j
M∗
1 j M1 j,

Ia(0)ρ =

j
M0 jρM∗
0 j,
(10.41)
A⊥=

j
M∗
0 j M0 j.
(10.42)
If the state before answering the question a is ρ = |ψ⟩⟨ψ|, the updated mind state
ρ{a=u} after deciding an answer a = u, to the question a is determined by the instru-
ment Ia as
ρ{a=y} =
Ia(1)ρ
Tr[Ia(1)ρ] =

j M1 j|ψ⟩⟨ψ|M∗
1 j
||A|ψ⟩||2
,
ρ{a=n} =
Ia(0)ρ
Tr[Ia(0)ρ] =

j M0 j|ψ⟩⟨ψ|M∗
0 j
||A⊥|ψ⟩||2
.
(10.43)
According to Eq.(10.20), an explicit form of the family {M1 j, M0 j} j is given with
parameter j = (β, γ ) as follows.
M1,(β,0) = |1, β, 0⟩⟨1, β, 0|, M1,(β,1) = |1, 0, 1⟩⟨1, β, 1|, M1,(β,2) = |1, 1, 2⟩⟨1, β, 2|.
M0,(β,0) = |0, β, 0⟩⟨0, β, 0|, M0,(β,1) = |0, 1, 1⟩⟨0, β, 1|, M0,(β,2) = |0, 0, 2⟩⟨0, β, 2|.
(10.44)
Thus, we reproduce Eqs.(10.40) and (10.42):

β.γ
M∗
1,(β,γ )M1,(β,γ ) =

β,γ
|1, β, γ ⟩⟨1, β, γ | = |1⟩⟨1| ⊗I2 ⊗I3 = A,

Psychological Effects and QQ-equality
Wang–Busemeyer [452] posed the following postulate:
Postulate 4QL: The updated belief state after deciding an answer to a question
equals the normalized projection on the subspace representing the answer.
This condition corresponds to the projective A-measuring instrument Iproj
a
such
that Iproj
a
(1)ρ = Aρ A and Iproj
a
(0)ρ = A⊥ρ A⊥. This instrument has the measure-
ment operators {A, A⊥} so that
ρ{a=y} =
Ia(1)ρ
Tr[Ia(1)ρ] = A|ψ⟩⟨ψ|A
||A|ψ⟩||2 ,
ρ{a=n} =
Ia(0)ρ
Tr[Ia(0)ρ] = A⊥|ψ⟩⟨ψ|A⊥
||A⊥|ψ⟩||2 ,
(10.45)
or states change as
|ψ⟩→|ψ{A=1}⟩=
A|ψ⟩
||A|ψ⟩||,
|ψ⟩→|ψ{A=0}⟩=
A⊥|ψ⟩
||A⊥|ψ⟩||.
(10.46)
Thus, our model satisﬁes Postulates 1-3QL consistent with those posed by Wang–
Busemeyer [452]. Moreover, our model generalizes Postulates 4QL posed by Wang–
Busemeyer [452] equivalent to the projection postulate, so that we allow any A-
measuring instrument for question A,
Last but not least, we should pose an additional postulate on the ensemble of
subjects, which is not explicit but satisﬁed by the Wang–Busemeyer model [452].
Postulate 5QL: If a sequence of question-response experiments is carried out on
the same ensemble of individual subjects, the joint probability of the sequence of
responses is a probability mixture of those joint probabilities with respect to the
frequency of individual mind states in the ensemble.
If a sequence of question-response experiments is carried out on the same ensem-
ble of individual subjects, and a randomly chosen individual subject has the state |ψ j⟩
with probability p j, then we suppose that the joint probability of the sequence of
responses X1 = x1, . . . , Xn = xn, where Xk = A or Xk = B and xk = 0 or xk = 1
for all k = 1, . . . , n, is given by
P(X1 = x1, . . . , Xn = xn|ρ} = Tr[IXn(xn) · IX1(x1)ρ],
(10.47)
where ρ = 
j p j|ψ j⟩⟨ψ j|. Then, we have
P(X1 = x1, . . . , Xn = xn|ρ)
=

j
p j P(X1 = x1, . . . , Xn = xn||ψ j⟩).
(10.48)

10.3 Mind State Transformations
141
Thus, Postulate 5QL is satisﬁed by our model.
The structure of this postulate is discussed in more detail in Sect.10.10.
10.3
Mind State Transformations
In modeling successive question-response experiments, such as the Clinton–Gore
experiment, we assume that the subject’s mind state is represented by the space
 = {0, 1}2 × {0, 1, 2}. Here we suppose that any individual subject has one of the
mind states, ω ∈, and any statistical ensemble of the subjects is characterized by
a probability distribution on . Thus, the statistical data under consideration should
be explained solely by one of the probability distributions on . The mind state
α represents the state in which the subject will answer “yes” for the question a if
α = 1 and answer “no” otherwise. The mind state β represents the analogous state
for the question b. Thus, the mind state (α, β) represents the subject’s prior belief as
long as the questions a and b are concerned. For (α, β, γ ) ∈ we write δ(α,β,γ ) =
|α, β, γ ⟩⟨α, β, γ | ∈D(H). In this way, we identify the mind state (α, β, γ ) ∈
with the quantum state |α, β, γ ⟩⟨α, β, γ | ∈D(H), and any probability distribution
μ of the mind states ω ∈ with the quantum state (density operator) denoted by the
same symbol
μ =

ω
μ(ω)δω =

α,β,γ
μ(α, β, γ )|α, β, γ ⟩⟨α, β, γ |.
(We remark that this is mixture of pure states.)
The dynamics of producing the answer to the question and preparing the mind
state for the next question is supposed to be described as a process of quantum
measurement, or equivalently a mathematical object called a quantum instrument.
Our previously deﬁned two quantum instruments Ia and Ib describe the mea-
surement on the mind state as follows.
Theorem 10.1 For any (α, β, γ ) ∈ and a, b = 0, 1, we have
Ia(x1)δ(α,β,0) = δα(x1)δ(α,β,0),
(10.49)
Ia(x1)δ(α,β,1) = δα(x1)δ(α,α⊥⊥,1),
(10.50)
Ia(x1)δ(α,β,2) = δα(x1)δ(α,α,2),
(10.51)
Ib(x2)δ(α,β,0) = δβ(x2)δ(α,β,0),
(10.52)
Ib(x2)δ(α,β,1) = δβ(x2)δ(β⊥⊥,β,1),
(10.53)
Ib(x2)δ(α,β,2) = δβ(x2)δ(β,β,2).
(10.54)

relations

from
Eqs.(10.20)
and

Psychological Effects and QQ-equality
The mind state γ represents the personality of the subject in such a way that if
γ = 1, the subject changes his/her mind to prepare the answer for the other question
to be the opposite to the previous answer, and if γ = 2, the subject changes his/her
mind to prepare the answer for the other question to be the same as the previous
answer; on the other hand, if γ = 0, the subject’s mind is so robust that the question
will not affect his/her mind.
Thus, the state change is the Bayesian update if γ has only the value γ = 0, and
yet if the value γ = 1 or γ = 2 is allowed, the statistics of the answers does not
follow the Bayesian update rule.
The following considerations considerably simplify our manipulations of instru-
ments Ia and Ib for arbitrary density operators ρ.
For any density operator ρ, we have
Ia(x1)ρ =

α,β,γ
μ(α, β, γ )Ia(x1)δ(α,β,γ ) = Ia(x1)ρ′,
Ib(x2)ρ =

α,β,γ
μ(α, β, γ )Ib(x2)δ(α,β,γ ) = Ib(x2)ρ′,
(10.55)
where μ(α, β, γ ) = ⟨α, β, γ |ρ|α, β, γ ⟩, and
ρ′ =

α,β,γ
μ(α, β, γ )δ(α,β,γ ).
(10.56)
The proof can be found in (open access) paper [370] (in appendix).
Therefore,theoperationsofIa andIb forarbitrarydensityoperatorsρ arereduced
to the operations for the density operators ρ′ of the form of Eq.(10.56), which are
diagonal in the |α, β, γ ⟩basis.
10.4
Response Replicability Effect: Personality States
Here, we consider two properties of successive measurements of observables a and
b. In a −a and a −b −a paradigms, the response to a is repeated (with probability
1). This is RRE. In a −b versus b −a paradigm, the joint probabilities of the two
responses are different on a set of states with a positive Lebesgue measure. This is
QOE.
The psychological problem raised by the Clinton–Gore experiment is as follows.
We are given two observables a and b which joint probability distributions (JPDs)
of successive measurements shows QOE and is naturally considered to satisfy RRE.
We cannot represent the JPDs as the JPDs of classical random variables a and b as
deﬁned by Kolmogorov, which does not show QOE, nor the JPDs of the outcomes

of successive measurements of noncommuting quantum observables A and B of the
von Neumann-Lüders type (Chap.16, Sect.8.1), which do not satisfy RRE.
We shall show that instruments Ia and Ib demonstrate both RRE (in this section)
and QOE (in the next section).
Theorem 10.2 The instruments Ia and Ib demonstrate RRE; for any density oper-
ator ρ, they satisfy the following relations.
(i) 
x1 Tr[Ia(x1)Ia(x1)ρ] = 1,
(ii)

(iv) 
x1,x2 Tr[Ib(x2)Ia(x1)Ib(x2)ρ] = 1.

Proof From Eq.(10.55) we assume without any loss of generality that ρ = δ(α,β,γ )
for some α, β, γ . For any α, β, we have

x1
Tr[Ia(x1)Ia(x1)δ(α,β,0)] =

Tr[Ia(x1)Ia(x1)δ(α,β,1)] = 1,

x1
Tr[Ia(x1)Ia(x1)δ(α,β,2)] = 1.
Thus, relation (i) follows. Relation (ii) follows analogously. For any α, β, we have

Question Order Effect: Personality States
In what follows, we shall show that instruments Ia and Ib have QOE.
Let μ = 
α,β,γ μ(α, β, γ )δ(α,β,γ ) for any probability distribution μ on , we
write
p(a = x1 b = x2) = Tr[Ib(x2)Ia(x1)μ],
(10.57)
p(b = x2 a = x1) = Tr[Ia(x1)Ib(x2))μ],
(10.58)
where x1, x2 = 0, 1. To match with notation of Wang and Busemeyer [452], we
will write Ay, An and By, Bn instead of x1 = 0, 1 and x2 = 0, 1; for example,
p(a = 1 b = 1) = p(AyBy).
Further, we have
p(a = x1 b = x2)
=

Thus,
p(AyBy) = μ(1, 1, 0) + μ(1, 1, 2) + μ(1, 0, 2).

p(AyBn) = μ(1, 0, 0) + μ(1, 0, 1) + μ(1, 1, 1).
(10.60)
p(AnBy) = μ(0, 1, 0) + μ(0, 1, 1) + μ(0, 0, 1).
(10.61)
p(AnBn) = μ(0, 0, 0) + μ(0, 0, 2) + μ(0, 1, 2).

Theorem 10.3 The instruments Ia and Ib match QOE; namely, we have the fol-
lowing statements. Let ρ be a density operator on H.
(i) The relation
Tr[Ib(1)Ia(1)ρ] = Tr[Ia(1)Ib(1)ρ]
(10.67)
holds if and only if ⟨1, 0, 2|ρ|1, 0, 2⟩= ⟨0, 1, 2|ρ|0, 1, 2⟩.
(ii) The relation
Tr[Ib(0)Ia(1)ρ] = Tr[Ia(1)Ib(0)ρ]
(10.68)
holds if and only if ⟨1, 1, 1|ρ|1, 1, 1⟩= ⟨0, 0, 1|ρ|0, 0, 1⟩.
(iii) The relation
Tr[Ib(1)Ia(0)ρ] = Tr[Ia(0)Ib(1)ρ]
(10.69)
holds if and only if ⟨1, 1, 1|ρ|1, 1, 1⟩= ⟨0, 0, 1|ρ|0, 0, 1⟩.
(iv) The relation
Tr[Ib(0)Ia(0)ρ] = Tr[Ia(0)Ib(0)ρ]
(10.70)
holds if and only if ⟨1, 0, 2|ρ|1, 0, 2⟩= ⟨0, 1, 2|ρ|0, 1, 2⟩.
(v) One of Eqs.(10.67), (10.68), (10.69), (10.70), for a general density operator
ρ, holds only on a set of density operators ρ with Lebesgue measure 0.
Proof Equation(10.67) holds if and only p(AyBy) = p(By Ay). Thus, assertion (i)
follows from Eqs.(10.55), (10.59), and (10.63). Assertions (ii)–(iv) follow similarly.
The last assertion follows from the fact that each relation holds on a submanifold of
the space of density operators with co-dimension 1.

Iftwoquestions,adjacenttoeachother,areaskedindifferentorders,thenthequantum
model of measurement order makes an a priori and parameter-free prediction, named
the QQ-equality (QQE) [452, 453]:

= [p(AyBn) + p(AnBy)] −[p(By An) + p(BnAy)] = 0.
(10.71)
Note that the formula in [453, p. 9435, left column] is not correct in that the ﬁrst and
second lines are not equal but have the opposite signs; the correct deﬁnition here is
due to [452]. We have

Theorem 10.4 The instruments Ia and Ib satisfy QQE.
□
10.7
Linking Experimental and Theoretical Data
We have shown that JPDs of responses to questions obtained from our model satisfy
QQE. Thus, if the original data did not satisfy QQE, we could not reproduce those
data from our model with arbitrary mind state ρ.
Given JPDs p(AyBy), p(AyBn), p(AnBy), p(AnBn), p(By Ay), p(By An),
p(BnAy), and p(BnAn), let
S1 = p(AyBy) + p(AnBn) + p(By Ay) + p(BnAn)
2
,
(10.76)
S2 = p(AyBn) + p(AnBy) + p(By An) + p(BnAy)
2
.
(10.77)
Then, if QQE holds, we have
p(AyBy) + p(AnBn) = p(By Ay) + p(BnAn) = S1,
(10.78)
p(AyBn) + p(AnBy) = p(By An) + p(BnAy) = S2.
(10.79)
Thus, in order for arbitrary p(· · · ) to satisfy QQE it is natural to “renormalize” them
as arp(· · · ) by
arp(AyBy) = S1 ×
p(AyBy)
p(AyBy) + p(AnBn),

arp(AnBn) = S1 ×

p(By Ay) + p(BnAn),
(10.82)
arp(BnAn) = S1 ×
p(BnAn)
p(By Ay) + p(BnAn),

arp(AyBn) = S2 ×

p(AyBn) + p(AnBy),

(10.86)
arp(BnAy) = S2 ×
p(BnAy)
p(By An) + p(BnAy).
(10.87)
We call arp(· · · ) the QQE-renormalization of p(· · · ). Then, as shown in the follow-
ing theorem, the QQE-renormalizations arp(· · · ) are joint probability distributions
satisfying QQE, which are close to the original joint probability distributions p(· · · )
in the sense that

From Theorem 10.5 (iv), if S1 = S2 and |q| ≪1, the renormalization error (arp −
p)/p is uniformly |q|, and if S1 < S2 and |q| ≪1, it is uniformly |q|/(2S1).

10.8
Independence of Belief and Personality States
In the previous sections, we have not assumed that in the probability distribution μ of
the mind state, the personality state is independent from the belief state. According
to Sect.10.1.2, the personality state determines the type of how the belief state is
changed by Ua and Ub. It would be desirable to describe it to be independent from
the belief state (α, β).
If the personality state depends on belief states, the same subject responds to
questionsinvariouspatterns,sothatitisdifﬁculttointerprettheroleofthisparameter,
and according to the number of free parameters it is likely that we can always ﬁnd a
suitable input data to explain the QQE renormalized output data by our model. On
the other hand, if the personality state is independent of belief states, each individual
subject is classiﬁed by the personality state and each ensemble of subjects for the
same experiment can be classiﬁed by the probability distribution of the personality
state. Thus, the statistical role of the personality state is quite clear.
However, in this case, the number of free parameters becomes not enough to
reproduce all the QQE renormalized output data. Thus, the new assumption that
the personality state is independent of the belief state brings about the following
interesting problems:
• (i) What QQE renormalized output data can be reproduced by the current model?
• (ii) In such output data, what are characteristic features of the probability distri-
bution of the personality state in the input data?
• (iii) How can we extend the role of the personality state to cover more QQE
renormalized output data?
For the case where only personality state is |0⟩, the model reduces to Bayesian
update model, which does not have QOE. In Chap.9 (see also the original work
[369]), we studied the model only with personality state |1⟩and showed that QOE
and RRE hold. In this paper, we shall further show that the model with personality
state |0⟩, |1⟩, |2⟩can account for the Clinton–Gore experiment [359].
Here, we assume the independence of the personality state. Thus, we suppose
μ(α, β, γ ) = p(α, β)q(γ ),
(10.89)
p(α, β) =

γ
μ(α, β, γ ),
(10.90)
q(γ ) =

α,β
μ(α, β, γ ).
(10.91)
Then, Eqs.(10.59)–(10.66) are written as follows.
p(AyBy) = p(1, 1)q(0) + p(1, 1)q(2) + p(1, 0)q(2).
(10.92)
p(AyBn) = p(1, 0)q(0) + p(1, 0)q(1) + p(1, 1)q(1).
(10.93)

150
10
Psychological Effects and QQ-equality
p(AnBy) = p(0, 1)q(0) + p(0, 1)q(1) + p(0, 0)q(1).
(10.94)
p(AnBn) = p(0, 0)q(0) + p(0, 0)q(2) + p(0, 1)q(2).
(10.95)
p(By Ay) = p(1, 1)q(0) + p(1, 1)q(2) + p(0, 1)q(2).
(10.96)
p(BnAy) = p(1, 0)q(0) + p(1, 0)q(1) + p(0, 0)q(1).
(10.97)
p(By An) = p(0, 1)q(0) + p(0, 1)q(1) + p(1, 1)q(1).
(10.98)
p(BnAn) = p(0, 0)q(0) + p(0, 0)q(2) + p(1, 0)q(2).
(10.99)
Let p(Ay) = p(AyBy) + p(AyBn), etc. Then, p(Ay) = p(1, 1) + p(1, 0), etc.
We have
p(AyBy) = p(1, 1)q(0) + p(Ay)q(2).
(10.100)
p(AyBn) = p(1, 0)q(0) + p(Ay)q(1).
(10.101)
p(AnBy) = p(0, 1)q(0) + p(An)q(1).
(10.102)
p(AnBn) = p(0, 0)q(0) + p(An)q(2).
(10.103)
p(By Ay) = p(1, 1)q(0) + p(By)q(2).
(10.104)
p(BnAy) = p(1, 0)q(0) + p(Bn)q(1).
(10.105)
p(By An) = p(0, 1)q(0) + p(By)q(1).
(10.106)
p(BnAn) = p(0, 0)q(0) + p(Bn)q(2).
(10.107)
Thus, if p(Ay) ̸= p(By) and p(Ay) ̸= p(Bn), we can determine q(0), q(1), q(2)
by the experimental data:
q(2) = p(AyBy) −p(By Ay)
p(Ay) −p(By)
,
(10.108)
q(1) = p(AyBn) −p(BnAy)
p(Ay) −p(Bn)
,
(10.109)
q(1) = p(AnBy) −p(By An)
p(An) −p(By)
,
(10.110)
q(2) = p(AnBn) −p(BnAn)
p(An) −p(Bn)
.
(10.111)
Note that since the output data {p(AaBb), p(BbAa) | a, b = y, n} obtained from
our model satisfy QQE, the above relations are consistent, so that q(1) and q(2)
are uniquely determined from the experimental data and then we determine q(0) by
q(0) + q(1) + q(2) = 1.
If we obtain the personality state q(0), q(1), q(2), the belief state is determined
by the following relations.
p(1, 1) = arp(AyBy) −arp(Ay)q(2)
q(0)
,
(10.112)

10.8 Independence of Belief and Personality States
151
p(1, 0) = arp(AyBn) −arp(Ay)q(1)

,
(10.113)
p(0, 1) = arp(AnBy) −arp(An)q(1)

q(0)
,
(10.118)
.p(0, 0) = arp(BnAn) −arp(Bn)q(2)
q(0)

(10.119)
Therefore, if
p(Ay) ̸= p(By) and
p(Ay) ̸= p(Bn), and Eqs. (10.108)–
(10.119) determine the probability distributions {q(0), q(1), q(2)} and joint
probability distributions {p(0, 0), . . . , p(1, 1)}, the QQE renormalized data
{arp(AyBy), . . . , arp(AnBn)} can be exactly reproduced by our model. A precise
statement for the reproducibility condition is given as follows.
Theorem 10.6 Suppose that joint probabilities p(AyBy), p(AyBn), p(AnBy),
p(AnBn), p(By Ay), p(By An), p(BnAy), and p(BnAn) for a, b = y, n, i.e.,
p(Aa, Bb), p(Bb, Aa) ≥0, 
a,b=y,n p(Aa, Bb) = 
a,b=y,n p(Bb, Aa) = 1, are
labeled so that
p(Ay) > p(By) ≥p(Bn) ≥p(An),
and satisfy QQE (10.71). Then, there exist input joint probabilities q(0), q(1), q(2)
and p(0, 0), p(0, 1), p(1, 0), p(1, 1) uniquely such that the model outputs the joint
probabilities {p(Ab, Ba), p(Bb, Ab) | a, b = y, n} if and only if the following con-
ditions hold:
(i)
p(AyBy) ≥p(By Ay),
(ii)
p(AyBn) ≥p(BnAy),
(iii)
p(AyBn) −p(By An)
p(Ay) −p(By)

p(AnBn)
p(An)
≥p(BnAn)
p(Bn) .
Proof Necessity: Relations (i) and (ii) follow from (10.108) and (10.109) with
the assumption p(Ay) ≥p(By) ≥p(Bn). Relation (iii) follows from relations
(10.108), (10.109) and 1 −q(1) ≥q(2); note that the assumption p(Ay) > p(By)
implies the relation p(Bn) > p(An). From (10.100) and (10.104), we have
p(AyBy)
p(Ay)
= q(0)p(1, 1)
p(Ay)
+ q(2),
p(By Ay)
p(By)
= q(0)p(1, 1)
p(By)
+ q(2),
and hence relation (iv) follows from the assumption p(Ay) > p(By) and p(1, 1) ≥
0. Relations (v), (vi), (vii) follow similarly from conditions q(0)p(1, 0) ≥
0, q(0)p(1, 0) ≥0, and q(0)p(0, 0) ≥0.
Sufﬁciency: Suppose that q(0), q(1), q(2), p(0, 0), . . . , p(1, 1) satisfy (10.100),
…, (10.107), and q(0) + q(1) + q(2) = 1. It sufﬁces to prove that they are non-
negative. We have p(2) ≥0 by relation (i) and (10.108). Similarly, p(1) ≥0 fol-
lows from relation (ii) and (10.109), and q(0) ≥0 follows from relation (iii) and
q(0) + q(1) + q(2) = 1. Then, p(0, 0) ≥0 follows from relation (iv) and (10.100).
The non-negativity of p(1, 0), p(0, 1), p(0, 0) follows similarly.

Modeling Statistical Data from Clinton–Gore Poll
In this section, we shall show that the well-known data from Clinton–Gore Poll
[359] can be reproduced within ±0.75% of errors from our model.
Consider the following data from Clinton–Gore experiment [359, 452, 453].
p(AyBy) = 0.4899,
(10.120)
p(AyBn) = 0.0447,
(10.121)
p(AnBy) = 0.1767,
(10.122)
p(AnBn) = 0.2887,
(10.123)
p(By Ay) = 0.5625,
(10.124)
p(By An) = 0.1991,
(10.125)
p(BnAy) = 0.0255,
(10.126)
p(BnAn) = 0.2129.
(10.127)
QQE is approximately satisﬁed with good accuracy.

q = [p(By Ay) + p(BnAn)] −[p(AyBy) + p(AnBn)]
= [p(AyBn) + p(AnBy)] −[p(By An) + p(BnAy)] = −0.0032.
(10.128)
Thus, their QQE-renormalization arp(Aa, Bb), arp(Bb, Aa) are expected to
approximate the original data p(Aa, Bb), p(Bb, Aa) with good accuracy.
For the Clinton–Gore poll, we have
S1 = p(AyBy) + p(AnBn) + p(By Ay) + p(BnAn)
2
= 0.7770,
(10.129)
S2 = p(AyBn) + p(AnBy) + p(By An) + p(BnAy)

= 0.2230,
(10.130)
and we obtain their QQE-renormalizations as follows.
arp(AyBy) = S1 ×

p(AyBy) + p(AnBn) = 0.4889,

Under
the
assumption
of
the
independence
of
the
personality
state,
from Eq.(10.108) and the relation q(0) + q(1) + q(2) = 1, we can determine
q(0), q(1), q(2) by the QQE-normalized data as follows.
q(2) = 0.3288,
(10.131)
q(1) = 0.0668,
(10.132)
q(0) = 0.6045.
(10.133)
We can determine p(α, β) for α, β = 0, 1 by Eqs.(10.100)–(10.107) as follows.
p(1, 1) = 0.5184,
(10.134)
p(1, 0) = 0.0155,
(10.135)
p(0, 1) = 0.2429,
(10.136)
p(0, 0) = 0.2231.
(10.137)
Note that the unity of the total probability is satisﬁed.
p(1, 1) + p(1, 0) + p(0, 1) + p(0, 0) = 1.0000.
Thus, the belief state p(α, β) and the personality state q(γ ) are determined
from the experimental data. Then, our quantum model with the belief state p(α, β)
and the personality state q(γ ) accurately reconstructs the QQE renormalized data
arp(Aa, Bb), arp(Bb, Aa) for a, b = y, n as follows.
arp(AyBy) = p(1, 1)q(0) + [p(1, 1) + p(1, 0)]q(2) = 0.4889,
arp(AyBn) = p(1, 0)q(0) + [p(1, 1) + p(1, 0)]q(1) = 0.0450,
arp(AnBy) = p(0, 1)q(0) + [p(0, 1) + p(0, 0)]q(1) = 0.1780,
arp(AnBn) = p(0, 0)q(0) + [p(0, 1) + p(0, 0)]q(2) = 0.2881,
arp(By Ay) = p(1, 1)q(0) + [p(0, 1) + p(1, 1)]q(2) = 0.5637,
arp(By An) = p(0, 1)q(0) + [p(0, 1) + p(1, 1)]q(1) = 0.1977,
arp(BnAy) = p(1, 0)q(0) + [p(0, 0) + p(1, 0)]q(1) = 0.0253,
arp(BnAn) = p(0, 0)q(0) + [p(0, 0) + p(1, 0)]q(2) = 0.2133.
Therefore, all data of the QQR-renormalizations are accurately reproduced, and
we conclude that our quantum model reproduces the statistics of the Clinton–
Gore Poll data almost faithfully (within ±0.75% of error) with a prior belief state

As we know, a density operator ρ can be decomposed into probabilistic mixtures of
pure states in various ways. We show that Postulate 5QL is invariant with respect to
such decompositions.
Suppose we conduct an experiment on 100 people. Then, we can suppose the
subject j = 1, ...100 is in a pure state ψ j and the ensemble is described by the mixed
state ρ1 = (1/100) 
j |ψ j⟩⟨ψ j|. We conduct another experiment on 200 people and
let and ρ2 = (1/200)

It follows that if pρ1 + p′ρ2 = ρ3, where p, p′ > 0, p′ = 1 −p. Then
pP(AaBb|ρ1) + p′P(AaBb|ρ2) = P(AaBb|ρ3).
This is consistent with

Part IV
Analysis of Social Systems within Open
Quantum System Theory
This part is devoted to the modeling of social behavior with the methodology and the
mathematical apparatus of the quantum ﬁeld theory. The basic ﬁeld under consider-
ation is the social information ﬁeld. Its excitations, infons, are analogs of photons.
They carry socially valuable information emitted by mass media and social networks.
Humans are treated as social analogs of atoms. They interact with infons and absorb
quantized social energy contained in the information. This framework is applied
for the development of social laser theory. This theory describes the coherent emis-
sion of spikes of social energy—social tsunamis. Nowadays, social lasers are actively
explored in social engineering, e.g., in color revolutions, mass protests, and the gener-
ation of coherent collective decisions. We also consider the social analog of Fröhlich
condensation. Here, societal stability is approached at a high social temperature with
the aid of a continuous energy supply and its redistribution between people, from
highly energetic individuals to less energetic ones. The crucial role is played by the
presence of the social bath absorbing a part of energy in the process of its redis-
tribution. The same model can be applied to stability modeling not only in human
societies, but even in groups of animals, i.e., wolf packs. Social networks contribute
both to social lasing and Fröhlich condensation. Internet-based Echo Chambers are
the basic components of social laser resonators. It is amazing that the network-based
social lasers are more effective than lasers based on disconnected elements, e.g.,
physical or social atoms.

Chapter 11
Social Laser
11.1
Social-Information Waves Shaking the World
During the last years, the grounds of the modern world were shaken by the coherent
information waves of very high amplitude. The basic distinguishing property of
such waves is that they carry huge amount of social energy. Thus, they are not
just the waves, widely distributing some special information content throughout the
human society. In contrast, their information content is surprisingly small. Typically,
it is reduced to one or a few labels, we can say “quasi-colors”. At the same time
information waves carry very big emotional charge, a lot of social energy. So, they
can have strong destructive as well as constructive impact on the human society.
I suggested [267] to model generation of very powerful and coherent social-
information waves within social laser theory which was later developed in collabo-
ration with a few coauthors (see [12, 269, 276, 277, 287, 289, 290]). At the beginning
of its creation, this theory was oriented toward modeling Stimulated Ampliﬁcation
of Social Actions (SASA) such as color revolutions and other mass protests around
the world (cf. with socio-political studies, e.g., [79, 147, 321, 345, 358, 403, 429,
433]). However, later it became clear that the social laser theory has essentially wider
domain of applications. And we will demonstrate this in the present chapter.
We remark that one of the creators of the laser theory, Haken, considered laser-
equations to illustrate the mathematical analogy with self-organization processes in
complex physical, biological, and social systems [184–186]. Our aim is different.
We want to formalize quantum-like properties of social-information systems which
can lead to SASA.
The basic entities of social laser theory are social energy, atoms, and ﬁelds [425],
[267], , [65, 336, 377, 389] (cf. also with [155, 216, 219, 220]). Social atoms rep-
resent humans. They exchange quanta of social energy with the social-information
ﬁeld which is composed of excitations carried by communications massively emitted
by mass media and social networks. The lasing scheme can be formulated with these

erally as actions both in physical and social-information spaces: mass protests, color
revolutions, wars as well as collective decisions on the important societal problems.
Article [307] was the important methodological step toward approaching closer
similarity with quantum physics. There were invented the social-information analogs
of photons which are called infons. These are excitations of the quantum social-
information ﬁeld carrying social energy and coarse-grained content of communica-
tions (their color and quasi-color).
We also analyze the dynamics of iterations of the cascades of infons in the social
resonators. The latter is based on social networks coupled to laser’s gain medium
composed of social atoms. The special attention is paid to the role of Echo Chambers.
They increase color and quasi-color coherence of the social-information ﬁeld.
Our theory formalizes the basic conditions for generation successful social lasing
[277]:
• Indistinguishability of social atoms. The human gain medium, population
exposed to the social-information radiation, should be composed of social atoms—
“creatures without tribe”: the role of national, cultural, religious, and even gender
differences should be reduced as much as possible (at least during the lasing
period).
• Indistinguishability of infons (content-ignorance). Social atoms process informa-
tioncommunications without deepanalyzingof their contents; theyextract onlythe
basic labels-“quasi-colors”, encoding the communications’ contents (“clip think-
ing”, “popcorn brain”). In formal terms, infons carrying the same color (social
energy) and quasi-color (rough content) are indistinguishable.
Of course, humans are still humans, not social atoms; thus, in contrast to quantum
physics, it is impossible to create human gain mediums composed of completely
indistinguishable creatures. People still have say names, gender, nationality, but
such characteristics are ignored in the regime of social lasing.1 In the same way,
information communications still can be distinguished if one analyzes them deeply.
However, social atoms who are overloaded by information cannot do this. The indis-
tinguishability condition leads to quantum statistics, Bose–Einstein, or Fermi–Dirac,
or parastatistics (Chap.18). Quantum Bose–Einstein statistics of infons is the basis
for generation of social-information cascades.
The important components of lasers, both physical and social, are resonators
[277], optical cavities versus social networks. Such devices play the double role:
• ampliﬁcation of the beam of physical vs. social-information radiation;
• improving coherence of this beam.
Social laser resonators play the crucial role in generation of coherent information
waves of high amplitude. They are based on the Internet Echo Chambers associated
with social networks, blogs, and YouTube channels. Their functioning is based on
1 Indistinguishability is deﬁnitely context dependent, i.e., we discuss creation of contexts which
are stimulating for social lasing. In such social, psychological, political, and economic conditions,
people behave as social atoms.

11.1 Social-Information Waves Shaking the World

the feedback process of posting and commenting, the process that exponentially
ampliﬁes the information waves that are initially induced by mass media (see also
Chap.12). Echo Chambers improve the coherence of the information ﬂow through
the statistical elimination of communications that do not match the main stream.
This statistical elimination is a consequence of the bosonic nature of the quantum
information ﬁeld.
We compare functioning of the optical and information mirrors. The latter repre-
sentsthefeedbackprocessintheinternetsystemssuchas,e.g.,YouTube.Incontrastto
the optical mirror, the information mirror not only reﬂects excitations of the quantum
information ﬁeld, but also multiplies them. Thus, this is a kind of reﬂector-multiplier.
As the result of this multiplication effect, social resonators are more effective than
physical ones. However, as in physics, resonator’s efﬁciency depends on a variety
of parameters. One of such parameters is the coefﬁcient of reﬂection-multiplication
(Sect.11.9). We analyze the multilayer structure of an information mirror and depen-
dence of this coefﬁcient on the layer (Sect.11.9).
In the previous studies, social laser theory was mainly applied for modeling
destructive processes, social tsunamis, e.g., in the form of mass protests. Collec-
tive decisions were typically societal responses to emergency situations and negative
emotions as fear, angst, and often aggression were basic for the process of social
energy pumping preceding collective decision-making in the form of stimulated
emission. So, even for lasing focused to a good goal, social energy pumping preced-
ing emission was not based on love between human beings.
Now we analyze the possibility to create “a societal beneﬁt laser”, i.e., directed for
societal good and not involving negative emotions, instincts, and feelings (Sect.11.8).
In particular, we discuss the possibility of creation of anti-war laser based not on angst
of mutual destruction or nuclear apocalypses, but on care, compassion, attention, cor-
diality, forgiveness, friendliness, humanism, kindness, mutual understanding, cor-
diality, and brotherhood. Unfortunately, we came to the pessimistic conclusions.
The role of social networks as lasing resonators is illustrated by the massive
protests during COVID-19 pandemic (Sect.11.8; cf.,e.g., [104, 445]).
We discuss creation of the competing beams of social-information radiation and
the conditions for their creation and coexistence, e.g., pro-democratic and pro-
republican beams during election campaigns in USA or the pro-war and pro-peace
beams generated since February 2022 in mass media and Internet resources. The role
of social networks is highlighted once again (cf. [41, 290]).
Social laser theory predicts that a human gain medium can approach the state
of population inversion with infons of one sort (quasi-color), but the stimulated
emission can be done by injection of a batch of infons of a different quasi-color,
memorylessness of social atoms. This is very important property of social laser which
can be widely used in social engineering. We illustrate this theoretical property with
a few examples from the modern social-political life.
In quantum physics the process of the energy exchange between an atom and the
electromagnetic ﬁeld depends not only on atom’s energy levels, but also on the spins
of electrons distributed on these levels as well as spins of photons in the surrounding
ﬁeld [353]. This part of quantum theory was missed in its previous applications to

162

Social Laser
social laser (with exception of [290]). It is natural to assume that as well as in physical
atoms in social atoms energy is stored in special blocks, “social electrons”. Such a
block is characterized not only by the amount of social energy stored in it, but also
by the additional characteristics—a social spin. Heuristically, it can be imagined as
an axis in the mental space. It is stable and the distribution of such social spins in
a social atom plays the important role in energy exchange between s-atoms and the
surrounding social-information ﬁeld (Sect.11.10).
In this paper we shall widely use the abbreviation s-for “social”, say s-atom,
s-energy.
11.2
Social Atom
A human is the minimal indivisible entity of society, a social atom (s-atom). The
atomic viewpoint on the human being has very long history; see Thims’ book [425], in
this book the reader can ﬁnd discussions and references on the basic human-atomistic
(or molecular) models:
• chemical entity (Johann Goethe, 1809),
• point atom (Humphry Davy, 1813),
• human molecule (Hippolyte Taine, 1869, Emile Boutmy, 1904, Henry Adams,
1910), Vilfredo Pareto, 1916, Pierre Teilhard, 1947),
• social molecule (Thomas Huxley, 1871),
• economic molecule (Leon Walras, c. 1870s),
• human atom (Ferninand Schiller, 1891, Erich Fromm, 1956),
• human chemical and human chemical element (William Fairburn, 1914),
• acquaintanceship atom, collective atom, individual atom, psychological atom
(Jacob Moreno, 1951),
• dissipative structure (Ilya Prigogine, 1971),
• human atomism (Arthur Iberall, 1987),
• social atom (Mark Buchanan, 2007).
Although these authors suggested different deﬁnitions, generally they follow the
same paradigm: operating with human beings as individual information processors
described by just a few parameters characterizing information interaction. Thus,
practically inﬁnite complexity of a human being was reduced to these basic parame-
ters, in the simplest case to social energy (Sect.11.3). This reduction of complexity
made humans treatable thermodynamically (Chap.18). On the other hand, ignoring
human complexity diminishes the explanatory power of such models; typically, they
can describe statistical behavior of humans, but not explain why they behave in one
or another way.
The distinguished property of our approach is the quantum-like treatment of vari-
ables, as representing observations. Another distinguished property is invention of
the quantum social-information ﬁeld, i.e., s-atoms can interact not only with each

11.3 Social Energy
163
other, as in aforementioned theories, but also with the social-information ﬁeld. The
latter is also interpreted and modeled in the quantum-like framework.
We have to make the following terminological remark. Generally we shall operate
with the words “it, its” by speaking about s-atoms. This is motivated by their indistin-
guishability in the process of social lasing and losing the basic human characteristics
(Sect.11.4). However, sometimes we would operate with the words “human, she, he,
her, him”, when the human nature of s-atoms should be noted.
11.3
Social Energy
As was already highlighted, Bohr denied the objectivity of quantum variables. Mea-
surements’ outcomes are generated in the process of complex interaction between a
system and a measurement device.
This approach is fruitful for introduction of social energy (s-energy). We do
not need to create a deep neurophysiological or psycho-social theory to justify this
notion (cf. [155, 216, 219, 220]). S-energy is an observable measuring the degree of
social excitement of a person. It can be done with a variety of measurement devices.
They can be calibrated with different scales, the simplest scale is dichotomous, E =
Ea0, Ea1, where these values are assigned to relaxation and excitement, respectively.
The simplest measurement procedure is done with question: “Do you feel your
socially excited or not?” From quantum operational viewpoint, such invention of the
s-energy observable seems to be justiﬁed. For more advanced and psychologically
justiﬁed measurement procedures for s-energy, see [65, 377].
This operational invention of s-energy as well as other mental observables can be
illustrated by the citation of Bohr [75]:
Indeed, the necessity of considering the interaction between the measuring instruments and
the object underinvestigationinatomic mechanicscorrespondscloselytopeculiardifﬁculties
met in psychological analysis which arise from the fact that the mental content is invaiably
altered when the attention is concentrated on it.
In future quantum-like modeling the crucial role will be played not by the absolute
values of the energy levels, but by their difference. For two-level s-atom (with relaxed
and excited states),
Ea = Ea1 −Ea0.
(11.1)
If both levels are high, but the energy gap is small, then such s-atom would not be
able to perform a strong s-action. Say, she would never participate in demonstrations
leading to brutal clashed with police.
Throughout this book we consider only two level s-atoms (see [289] for social
laser based on the multilevel s-atoms).

164
11
Social Laser
The energy levels determine the corresponding mental states of an s-atom which
are denoted as |Ea0⟩, |Ea1⟩. The main feature of quantum representation of states
is the existence of superpositions, e.g., s-atom can be not only in the mental states
|Ea0⟩, |Ea1⟩, corresponding to the concrete values of s-energy, but also in superpo-
sition states of the form:
|ψ⟩= ca0|Ea0⟩+ ca1|Ea1⟩,
(11.2)
where |ca0|2 + |ca1|2 = 1, caj ∈C. The complex coefﬁcients caj, j = 0, 1, encode
the probabilities,
p j = P(E = E j|ψ) = |c j|2
(11.3)
is the probability that s-atom in the mental state |ψ⟩would answer that his s-
energy equals E j. (Here we consider the introspective measurement procedure of
s-energy when s-atom is asked to report his energetic feeling and the set of answers is
restricted to
• “I feel me relaxed”,
• “I feel me excited.”
This probability depends on the state |ψ⟩of s-atom, this fact is reﬂected in the symbol
P(E = E j|ψ). This formula is the Born’s rule. The mental state space of s-atom
is a complex Hilbert space H. For two level s-atom, H is two dimensional with
the orthonormal basis |Ea0⟩, |Ea1⟩(qubit space). As is typical in physics, the scalar
product of two vectors from H is denoted as ⟨ψ1|ψ2⟩. In terms of the scalar product
of s-atom’s states, the Born rule is written as
p j = |⟨Eaj|ψ⟩|2.
(11.4)
The

of
non-objectivity of s-energy. Before s-atom is asked to estimate his-her s-energy,
he-she does not know its value. Of course, one can design other methodologies for
measurement of s-energy which are not based on self-observations.
11.4
Social-Information Field
In accordance with QFT, a ﬁeld represents an ensemble of its energetic excitations.
Mathematically, this excitation structure of a ﬁeld is described in Fock space. Quan-
tum ﬁelds are described with the operators of creation and annihilation of excitations.

11.4 Social-Information Field
165
Quantum ﬁeld Excitations—Photons, Phonons, Infons
Quantum ﬁeld excitations are treated on equal grounds with “real systems” such
as atoms or electrons. Say excitations of the electromagnetic ﬁelds are photons.
Moreover, excitations corresponding vibrations, e.g., of atoms in a crystal or dipoles
in a molecular, also treated as systems, phonons.
In social studies, we proceed in the same way. The social-information
(s-information) quantum ﬁeld which is generated by mass media and Internet-based
s-networks is an ensemble of energetic excitations, each excitation is determined
by the portion, “quantum”, of s-energy. The ﬁeld excitations are generated by the
sources of socially relevant information, mainly by mass media and s-networks. Each
communication emitted by them carries a quantum of s-energy. We call such quanta
infons.
We remark that the s-information quantum ﬁeld should not be imagined as a
continuous wave propagating in physical space. Mathematically any quantum ﬁeld
is a structure of the very high degree of abstractness: operator valued distribution
(generalized function). Connection of a quantum ﬁeld with real world is via detection
of its excitations.
In physics photon’s energy can be connected with light’s frequency and hence
the color of the corresponding spectral line. In the same way we can color infons,
depending on the amount of s-energy:
• low—red,
• intermediate—yellow, green, blue,
• high—violet.
For example, during the pandemic the majority of communication on COVID-19
was of the violet color; during the spring of year 2022 news about the war were also
violet, but the communications about COVID-19 were colored in red. News about
sexual affairs of politicians and stars can be colored in yellow.
Wehopethatthiss-energy/colorterminologywouldnotbemisleading.Inordinary
life red means danger and attracts more attention than violet. But, in physics red
photons are low energetic and violet photons are highly energetic. We keep the
physical picture. So, the red colored infons carry small amounts of s-energy and
violet infons are highly energetic.
In fact, in physics characterization of QFT excitations is not reduced to energy.
For example, a photon also has polarization. Generally, photon’s state |Eα⟩is char-
acterized by the parameters E = energy and α = (polarization, temporal, and spatial
extensions). S-information ﬁeld can also have some characteristics additional to
s-energy and related to communication’s content. We call such characteristics the
quasi-color of infon; its state can be encoded as |Eα⟩, where E and α are s-energy
and the quasi-color respectively.

166

Social Laser
Quantum Versus Quantum-like Indistinguishability
Introduction of the quasi-color is a delicate process related to such foundational issue
as indistinguishability of quantum systems (see, e.g., [43]). Quantum theory assumes
that two photons in the state |Eα⟩are indistinguishable. Moreover, it is claimed
that there are no hidden variables, additional photon’s characteristics which would
provide a possibility to distinguish two photons in the state |Eα⟩. So, in quantum
physics indistinguishability has the fundamental character. Indistinguishability plays
the crucial role in derivation of quantum statistics for energy distribution in the
framework of statistical thermodynamics [405].
This is the good place to mention once again phonons, the quanta of vibrations,
e.g., in a crystal, excitations of the ﬁeld of mechanical ﬂuctuations. To describe the
specialquantumeffects,phononshavetobeindistinguishable,uptosomeparameters,
the energy is the basic one. While photons still match with our image of particles (at
least up to some degree), phonons are really immaterial entities carrying information
about the relative ﬂuctuations of atoms. So, phonons are not so different from infons.
In quantum-like modeling of the excitations of the s-information ﬁeld infons are
indistinguishable, up to s-energy E and the quasi-color α. This is the important
assumption beyond social laser theory. However, there is one important difference
between quantum and quantum-like indistinguishabilities. The former is genuine and
irreducible and the latter is relative to context. In one context some social variables are
important and they should be included in the quasi-color α, in another context they do
not play any role, so they are not included in α. But, we cannot deny their existence.
For example, humans have names, but their names do not play any role in the process
of social lasing in the form of mass protests. So, humans are indistinguishable w.r.t.
to the name variable. The slogan “Black Lives Matter” is the integral quasi-color
which was crucial in the protests in USA. The concrete names of black people who
experienced racism, discrimination, and racial inequality were hidden in this quasi-
color.
So, indistinguishability in social laser theory is quantum-like. It is up to the charac-
teristics determining the process of lasing. These characteristics form the quasi-color
α. And infons’ indistinguishability is up to s-energy and this quasi-color. For exam-
ple, α can be “corruption”, then infon’s state is characterized by s-energy (color)
and corruption label (quasi-color). So, whole content of a communication is reduced
to the corruption label. Of course, a communication can carry a lot of additional
information, but in the process of this concrete lasing it would be ignored.
Social-Information Field as Bosonic Quantum Field
We start with consideration of quantum physics. We are interested in absorption and
emission of photons by atoms, especially in the balance of these processes.

11.4 Social-Information Field
167
Bosonic creation operator a∗and annihilation operator a verify the canonical
commutation relation in the form
[a∗, a] = a∗· a −a · a∗= I,
where I is the unit operator. These operators are not Hermitian, so they do not
represent quantum observables. The quantum observable for this system is the photon
number operator given by the composition of the operators,
n = a∗a
(11.5)
giving for a laser the number of photons in the considered mode u. Here u encodes
both photon’s momentum (in particular its energy) and polarization. So, all operators
are labeled by the mode-parameter u as a∗
u, au.nu.
The quantum ﬁeld description of the stimulated emission is a collective effect,
i.e., an atom interacts with a batch of photons and not just with an individual photon.
The crucial role is played by the Bose–Einstein statistics of the photons. Consider
the n-photon state |n, u⟩, for a ﬁxed mode u.
This state can be represented in the form of the action of the creation operator a†
α
on the vacuum state |0, u >:
|n, u⟩
=

a†
u
n/
√
n!

|0, u⟩
(11.6)
This representation gives the possibility to ﬁnd (with simple calculations in the
QFT state space—the Fock space) that the transition probability amplitude from the
state |n, u > to the state |n + 1, u > equals
Pu(n →n + 1) =
√
n + 1.
(11.7)
On the other hand, it is well known that the reverse process of absorption is char-
acterized by the transition probability amplitude from the state |n, u > to the state
|n −1, u > given by
Pu(n →n −1) = √n .
(11.8)
Thus, in a quantum bosonic ﬁeld the increase in the number of photons leads to an
increase of the probability of generation of one more photon in the same state. This
constitutes one of the “quantum advantages” of laser-stimulated emission showing
that the emission of a coherent photon is more probable than the absorption.
In social science and ﬁnance, the bosonic and fermionic algebras of operators were
used in works [24, 36]. It is interesting that applications outside of physics lead to the
use of the operator algebra mixing bosonic and fermionic features in the so-called
qubit operator algebra [312] for applications to the theory of decision-making.
Bosonic statistics of infons was derived in article [267] (see Chap.18) on the
basis of their indistinguishability up to the parameter u = (E, α), where E is infon’s

168
11
Social Laser
color (its s-energy) and α is infon’s quasi-color (content-label). Generally indis-
tinguishability implies one of quantum statistics, Bose–Einstein, Fermi–Diract, or
parastatistics. The ﬁrst one is characterized by an arbitrary number of systems for
the same mode u, so the states |n, u⟩are deﬁned for any n = 0, 1, 2, ... . The second
one reﬂects the Pauli exclusion principle, here n = 0, 1. The parastatistics assumes
the concrete upper bound q for n, i.e., n = 0, 1, ..., q, for the q-statistics.
We selected for infons the Bose–Einstein statistics, since mass media and Internet
can generate (practically) any number of communications, messages, news, posts,
comments on the same mode u.
Parastatistics are not present in quantum physics. But they may be found in cog-
nitive and social phenomena. For example, one can estimate the number of possible
infons on the same mode u which can be generated in human civilization. But, for
very large q, the difference between the q-statistics and the Bose–Einstein statistics
is practically invisible.
For infons (under the assumption of the Bose–Einstein statistics), we can use the
formalism of operators of creation and annihilation. In combination with Born’s rule
for the transition probabilities we obtain the formulas (11.7) and (11.8). Hence, in
the social framework we arrive at the same conclusion as in the physical one:
Interpretation of Infon’s State
In above consideration we operated with the word “to treat”. But, who does treat
(analyze) infon’s content and the level of its energizing? This is s-atom which plays
not only the role of infon’s receiver, but also of its analyzer. Thus, the state of infon
is not objective. This state is assigned to infon by s-atom receiving it. This is a
subjective state. In principle, it depends on the receiver-analyzer: s-atom. Even “to
be or not to be entangled” is subjective.
In contrast, in physics a state is considered as the state of a system, say the
state of photon. However, this state’s objectivity is questioned by Schrödinger [406].
In this article, he considered a quantum state as mathematical representation of
potentiality to obtain outcomes of observables. This ideology was structured within
Quantum Bayesianism (QBism) developed by Fuchs and coauthors (e.g., [163–168]).
In QBism quantum probabilities given by the Born rule are interpreted as subjective
probabilities of individual agents dealing with quantum theory and experiment.
We also interpret probabilities as subjective probabilities assigned to infons by
s-atoms. Generally variability of such probabilities and quantum-like states beyond
them can be high. However, to be able to apply quantum-like models for collective
phenomena, including social laser, we assume that populations of s-atoms under
consideration are characterized by homogeneous assignment of states and, hence,
subjective probabilities. This homogeneity results from social rules, traditions (cul-
tural, historical), opinion-structuring with the aid of mass media and social networks.

11.5 Absorption and Emission of Infons by Social Atom
169
So, within such a population a quantum-state can be considered as infon’s state. One
can speak about state’s objectivity w.r.t. to some population of s-atoms. Social lasers
work within such populations.
11.5
Absorption and Emission of Infons by Social Atom
Here we consider processes of absorption and emission of quanta of s-energy by
s-atoms interacting with the excitations of the s-information ﬁeld—infons.
Absorption
Consider physical atoms with two levels of energy, excited and relaxed, E1 and E0.
The difference between these levels
Ea = Ea1 −Ea0
(11.9)
is the basic energetic parameter of an atom, its spectral line.2
Two level atom reacts only to photons carrying energy E matching with atom’s
spectral line (Bohr’s rule):
Ea = E.
(11.10)
In quantum-like modeling, we apply Bohr’s rule to s-atoms and infons. So, two level
s-atom reacts only to infons carrying energy E matching atom’s spectral line, see
(11.9) and (11.10).
If infon carries too high energy which is larger than the spectral line, E > Ea,
then this s-atom would not be able to absorb this infon. For example, infon carrying
s-energy E is a call for upraise against the government. And s-atom is a bank clerk
(say Elena) in Moscow. Elena has the liberal views and hates Putin’s regime, but
her spectral line is too small to absorb s-energy carried by such infon and to move
from the ground state to the excited state. She simply ignores such highly energetic
communication, news, or internet-post. Similarly, if infon’s s-energy E is less than
spectral line Ea, then Elena would not be excited by such infon.
As well as a physical atom cannot collect energy from a few low energy photons,
with E < Ea, s-atom cannot collect s-energy from a few infons carrying small
portions of s-energy. S-atom either absorbs infon (if their colors match each other),
or she does not react to it. In the same way, s-atom cannot “eat” just a portion of
s-energy carried by highly energetic infon with E > Ea.
2 In the case of two level atom, it has just one spectral line. Generally there are a few spectral
lines corresponding to differences between energy levels, Ea;ij = Eai −Eaj, i > j. This is atom’s
spectrum.

170
11
Social Laser
Spontaneous and Stimulated Emissions
In the quantum-like theory, the process of infon emission by excited s-atom is also
characterized by its spectral lines. In the case of two level s-atom this is just the
number Ea. S-atom can emit only infon satisfying (11.10).
As in physics, emission can be spontaneous when s-atom suddenly emits infon—
at random instance of time and with a random quasi-color. Another sort of emission
is known as stimulated; s-atom emits infon as the result of interaction with infons of
the surrounding s-information ﬁeld. Ideally a single infon in the state |Eα⟩, where
E = Ea, stimulates excited s-atom to emit infon in the precisely the same state.
So, emitted infon has not only the same s-energy as stimulating infon, but also the
same quasi-color α. However, since this process is probabilistic (as all quantum-
like processes), the real stimulation of emission is possible only with ﬁelds of high
density. So, s-atom should interact with a strong s-information ﬁeld, with a cloud
of excitations which have the same s-energy (equal to Ea) and quasi-color. Inside
such ﬁeld the probability of emission is high.
In quantum physics spontaneous emission of photon by atom is considered as
exhibition of irreducible quantum randomness. However, such picture might be ade-
quate only for completely isolated atom. But real atom is never completely isolated.
Background radiation is everywhere. Therefore, it may be that even the spontaneous
emission is not a totally random process. It can be stimulated by ﬂuctuations of the
background electromagnetic ﬁeld and interactions with other atoms. In the same
way, spontaneous emission of social excitation might be generated by ﬂuctuations
in the surrounding social environment: occasional news, a scandal with a partner, a
problem at work, and so on. The quasi-color which emitting s-atom assigns to infon
(or action in physical space generated by this infon) may reﬂect the environment’s
quasi-color.
In physics the photon absorption-emission condition (11.10) is satisﬁed only
approximately
E ≈Ea.
(11.11)
The spectral line broadening is always present. In an ensemble of atoms Ea =
Ea(ω) is the Gaussian random variable. This is a bell centered at the mean average
value
¯
Ea. The dispersion of the Gaussian distribution depends on an ensemble
of atoms. Ensembles with small dispersion are better as gain mediums for physical
lasing, but deviations from exact law (11.10) are possible.
It is natural to assume Gaussian distribution realization of exact laws even for
social systems; in particular, absorption of excitations of the information ﬁeld by s-
atoms. Thus, deviations from (11.10) are possible. But a good human gain medium
(an ensemble of s-atoms selected for social lasing) should be energetically homoge-
neous. Therefore, the corresponding Gaussian distribution should have very small
dispersion. The latter is also the important necessary condition for functioning of
physical laser.

11.6 Social and Physical Lasers
171
Memorylessness of Atoms
Finally, we discuss one interesting feature of interrelation of absorption and emission:
Consider quantum physics. Suppose that an atom absorbed a photon with momen-
tum vector p. This vector determines the direction of photon’s propagation and its
length |p| determines photon’s energy. The process of absorption is characterized by
matching of energies (11.10), so the direction of photon’s propagation given by
α ≡p/|p|
(11.12)
does not play any role in the process of absorption. The most interesting for us is that
an atom “forgets” the direction α of incoming photon. In the process of spontaneous
emission, an atom emits a photon in an arbitrary direction. Moreover, in the process
of stimulated emission an atom emits a photon with momentum which is identical
to momentum of stimulating photons, the stimulating electromagnetic ﬁeld.
The same “memory washing” is a feature of quantum-like model, since its math-
ematical formalism is identical to quantum physical theory. So, s-atom does not
remember the quasi-color α of infon, say a news, which it has absorbed. It can emit
spontaneously infon, say a post in a social network, of an arbitrary quasi-color. When
s-atom is stimulated for emission, it emits infon of the same quasi-color as stimu-
lating infons, say news. This memorylessness of s-atoms is very important in social
engineering, including social lasing (see also Sect.11.10).
11.6
Social and Physical Lasers
For simplicity, we continue to consider two level atoms, both physical and social. We
shall present the social lasing scheme parallelly to the scheme of physical lasing.
Laser’s Components and Stages of Lasing
Physical laser has three main components:
• A gain medium composed of atoms.
• A source of energy (the electromagnetic ﬁeld).
• A resonator (an optical cavity).

172
11
Social Laser
Physical lasing has two main stages:
• (A). Energy pumping. Energy is pumped into a gain medium; the aim is to approach
the population inversion—more than 50% of atoms should be transferred into the
excited state.
• (B). Stimulated emission. A batch of photons propagating in the same direction
α given by (11.12) is injected into the gain medium. They stimulate the cascade
process of the emission of photons by atoms.
At the both stages, the colors of photons and atoms’ spectral line match each other
at least approximately (for two level atoms there is just one spectral line). The gain
medium should be color-homogeneous. Photons produced during the B-stage copy
the direction of propagation from stimulating photons. The latter was injected along
the main axis of the optical cavity—laser’s resonator. As was pointed out in Sect.11.5,
the directions of photons’ propagation at the A and B stages can be totally different
(memorylessness of atoms). Some important details will be mentioned below to
illustrate the corresponding details of social lasing.
The social laser also has three components:
• A gain medium composed of s-atoms (humans).
• A source of s-energy (the s-information ﬁeld).
• A social resonator (Internet-based social networks).
Social lasing also has two main stages:
• (A). Energy pumping. S-energy is pumped into a human gain medium; the aim
is to approach the population inversion—more than 50% of s-atoms should be
transferred into the excited state.
• (B). Stimulated emission. A batch of infons of the same quasi-color α is injected
into the gain medium. They stimulate the cascade process of the emission of infons
by s-atoms.
Now we describe these stages in more detail:
The mass media and Internet pump s-energy into a human gain medium aiming
to approach the population inversion—to excite the majority of people. The gain
medium should be homogeneous w.r.t. its spectral structure, ideally Ea = Const.
In reality Ea is a Gaussian random variable with very small standard deviation.
The s-energies of infons (communications, news, messages, internet-videos) used
for energy pumping do not need be so sharply concentrated around average Ea of
Ea. S-atoms would simply ignore infons essentially deviating from Ea. And such
s-energy losses are compensated by the powerful ﬂows of information generated by
modern mass media and Internet.
After achievement of the population inversion, the stimulated emission is started.
A batch of infons (say communications, news) is injected into the human gain
medium. The ﬁrst constraint is that s-energy of these stimulating infons should match
the spectral line of s-atoms, see (11.10) (in the ideal case). In reality it is sufﬁcient to
control the approximate matching condition (11.11). So, s-energy of injected infons
should not deviate essentially from Ea. Another constaint on injected infons is that

11.6 Social and Physical Lasers
173
they all should carry the same quasi-color α, say α = COVID-19, or α = vaccination,
or α = Russian aggression against Ukraine (depending on the socio-political con-
text and the aims of social lasing). This injected beam of social-information radiation
generates the cascade process in the gain medium.
Quasi-color homogeneity of the stimulating information injection is the basis of
quasi-color coherence of the laser beam of infons. Later this social-information beam
is transferred into the social action matching infons’ color (s-energy amplitude) and
quasi-color (information content). Infons’ homogeneity should be very high. Here
statistical deviations are not acceptable, since infons of other quasi-colors would
also generate their own cascades. Such “noise-cascades” would destroy quasi-color
coherence of the output beam of social radiation. They should be then eliminated
with the aid of social resonators.
Cascade’s Dynamics
In the simpliﬁed picture, each infon stimulates s-atom to emit infon having the same
color and quasi-color with its stimulator. Resulting two infons stimulate two s-atoms
to emit two new infons, so one stimulating infon resulted in four infons which inter-
act with four s-atoms and so on. After say 20 steps there are 220, approximately one
million of infons (the excitations of the social-information ﬁeld) of the same color
and quasi-color. In reality, the process is probabilistic: s-atom reacts to stimulat-
ing infon only with some probability. The latter rapidly increases with the increase
of the density of the social-information ﬁeld. And ﬁeld’s bosonic nature is crucial
(Sect.11.4).
In physics, the beam induced in the gain medium by the stimulating injection
of coherently colored photons is not the laser’s output beam. Laser has an addi-
tional component which plays the crucial role in increasing both the amplitude and
coherence of the output beam. This is a laser resonator. For lasers emitting photons—
excitations of the quantum electromagnetic ﬁeld, this is an optical cavity. Its mirrors
reﬂect beams generated inside the gain medium and send them back to this medium.
In this way, the cascade process in the gain medium is repeated many times.
Coherence Increasing Within Resonator
The process of reﬂection from the mirrors also increases spatial coherence of the
beam. The photons propagating not precisely along the main axis of the cavity are
reﬂected outside of the cavity and disappear. We remark that the stimulating beam is
sent along this axis. The cascade photons copy the direction of propagation in space
given by momentum vector (11.12) of initially injected photons.
Thephotondynamicsinsidethecavityalsoincreasestemporalcoherence.Theﬁrst

Social Laser
dispersion, since produced photons (moving with the light velocity) pass very quickly
through the atom gain medium. This temporally sharp wave of energy approaches the
mirror and it is reﬂected back—toward the gain medium. Of course, some arriving to
the mirror photons can deviate from the main spike; they are also reﬂected toward the
gain medium and induce cascades. But the latter are negligibly small compared with
the cascades induced by iterations of the main spike, because the probability of pho-
ton’s emission by an atom depends on the density of the surrounding electromagnetic
ﬁeld.
We remark that during the beam iterations (through reﬂections) energy is con-
tinued to be pumped into the gain medium from outside. So, atoms which emitted
photons in the preceding iterations absorb newly incoming photons and move to the
excited state. Intensity of pumping of energy quanta into the gain medium should be
high enough, higher than some threshold depending on laser’s parameters (see [287]
for details; cf. [184–186]). This threshold is called the lasing threshold. If the inten-
sity of energy pumping is lower than the lasing threshold, then too many atoms would
spontaneously relax between two reﬂection-iterations of the basic wave of photons.
On one hand, this is the energy loss; on the other hand, the mini-cascades created
in the excited gain medium by spontaneous emissions would lower coherence of the
radiation beam. If the intensity is higher than the lasing threshold, then practically
all energy pumped into the gain medium is transferred into the basic radiation wave
propagating along the cavity’s axis.
We remark that in physics the coherence of the laser beam is typically discussed
in the classical wave framework [187] by operating with frequencies and phases.
In social applications, I was not able to invent the proper analogs of these notions.
We proceed solely with s-energy and quasi-color. And coherence is deﬁned in these
terms. However, even information beams have the temporal structure. And we shall
discuss corresponding coherence.
In our quantum-like model the social laser also should have a resonator, a kind of
two mirrors which reﬂect infons and send them back into the human gain medium—
to interact again with s-atoms in the human gain medium and to stimulate them to
emit infons. The role of such social resonators is played by Internet-based infor-
mation systems, such as YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Bastyon, Telegram, Life
Journal, VK, and so on. The main distinguishing feature of these systems is the pos-
sibility of the rapid feedback to communications, news, and videos in the form of
comments, comments on comments and so on. The beam of infons created from the
initial stimulating injection (typically by mass media’s giants such as say BBC and
CNN, Washington Post, New York Times, and Guardian) is distributed over internet
channels and create new posts (in the form of articles and videos), each of them is
actively commented. Each comment plays the role of a mirror. But this is a kind of
an active mirror, not only reﬂecting infons but creating them. By reading a comment
say a YouTube user absorbs infon matching the color and quasi-color of the post and
transits to the excited state. In physics, this is a part laser theory—laser with active
mirrors. Some of its social counterparts were developed in article []. So, social res-
onators are more complicated devices than simply passive reﬂecting optical mirrors
used in physical laser.

11.6 Social and Physical Lasers
175
As well as the physical resonator, the social resonator not only ampliﬁes the beam
of social radiation inside the human gain medium, but also increases its coherence
w.r.t. the quasi-color α of the stimulating injection. Posts quasi-colored differently
from α disappear in the massive ﬂow α-infons.
Besides quasi-color coherence, a social resonator increases temporal coherence.
Since each stimulating news, as say with α = “the start of the war at Ukraine”,
rises up to a wave of the α-posts, practically immediately. We should not forget that
communications propagate via optical ﬁbers and wireless with the light velocity.
Comments appearing in the s-networks with a delay from the main wave are typically
ignored.
Summarizing Social Laser Theory
• Our quantum-like model is of the quantum ﬁeld type, the social-information ﬁeld.
Its excitations are called infons. Each infon transports quantum of s-energy. The
latter determines infons’ color, red infons are low energetic and violet infons are
highly energetic.
• Each s-atom is characterized by the s-energy spectrum; in the simplest case of two
levels, this is the difference between the energies of the excitation and relaxation
states, Ea = E1 −E0.
• Beside s-energy (color), infons (the excitations of the information ﬁeld) are char-
acterized by other labels, quasi-colors, carrying content of information communi-
cations.
• Coherence corresponds to quasi-color sharpness; ideal social laser emits a single
quasi-color mode, denoted say by the symbol α.
• Excited s-atoms by interacting with α-colored infons also emit α-colored infons.
• The amount of s-energy carried by stimulating infons (communications, news,
comments, Internet-posts) should match the color of s-atoms in the gain medium.
• To approach the population inversion, s-energy is pumped into the gain medium.
Pumping should be intensive, since s-atoms have the tendency spontaneously relax
and emit infons with randomly distributed quasi-colors.
• This energy pumping is driven by the mass media and the Internet sources.
• The gain medium should be homogeneous with respect to s-energy spectrum.
Ideally (for the two level case), all s-atoms should have the same color Ea.
However, in reality, it is impossible to create such human gain medium. As in
physics, the spectral line broadening has to be taken into account.
• The quasi-colors of infons in energy pumping have no direct connection with
the quasi-color of infons generated by stimulating emission (memorylessness of
s-atoms).
• Infons follow the Bose–Einstein statistics.
• This statistics matches with the bandwagon effect in psychology [107] (see article
[290] for details).

176
11
Social Laser
• The probability of emission of the α-colored infon by s-atom in a human gain
medium increases very quickly with the increase of the intensity of the social-
information ﬁeld on the α-colored mode.
• The stimulating injection of homogeneously quasi-colored infons gives rise to the
cascade of coherent (w.r.t. the color and quasi-color) infons.
• The created social radiation beam is ampliﬁed in the social resonators based on
Internet information systems, say YouTube, Facebook.
• The social resonators, especially in the form of Internet-based Echo Chambers,
also improve quasi-color coherence (Sect.11.7).
• When the power of the beam of coherent infons becomes very high, infons are
transformed into s-actions, either in physical or information spaces. Actions are
understood very generally from collective coherent decision-making to physical
actions, as mass protests, demonstrations, color revolutions
For example, a gain medium consisting of humans in the excited state and stimulated
by the anti-corruption quasi-colored information ﬁeld would “radiate” a wave of
anti-corruption protests. The same gain medium stimulated by an information ﬁeld
carrying another quasi-color would generate the wave of actions corresponding to
this last quasi-color. For social laser engineering, it is very important that the quasi-
colors of s-energy supply and stimulation of emission do not need to coincide—
memorylessness.
11.7
Echo Chamber: Social Coherence Reinforcing
The detailed presentation of social resonators theory can be found in article [290]. In
the latter we highlighted the differences between the physical resonators of the cavity
type, so to say “passive reﬂectors”, and the social resonators which are based on the
“s-mirrors. Such mirrors can be treated as active reﬂectors producing on demand of
users new infons.
Here we shall consider in more detail special, but at the same time very important
type of social resonators, namely, Internet-based Echo Chambers (see also [290]).
In our notations, it can be deﬁned as following:
Echo Chamber is a system in that some beams of infons carrying (as their quasi-
colors) news, communications, ideas, and behavioral patterns are ampliﬁed and
sharped through their feedback propagation inside this system. In parallel to such
ampliﬁcation, infons carrying quasi-colors different from those determined by the
concrete Echo Chamber are suppressed.
In our terms, an Echo Chamber is a device for transmission and active re-emission
(not simply reﬂection) of infons—the excitations of the quantum social-information
ﬁeld. Its main purpose is ampliﬁcation of this ﬁeld and increasing its quasi-color
coherence via distilling from “s-noise”, i.e., infons colored and quasi-colored differ-
ently from Echo Chamber’s basic color and quasi-color.

11.7 Echo Chamber: Social Coherence Reinforcing
177
We underline that an Echo Chamber is considered as a component of the social
laser, as its resonator. The coherent output of an Echo Chamber, the quasi-color of this
output, is determined not only by the internal characteristics of the Echo Chamber,
but also by the quasi-color of stimulated emission in laser. The same Echo Chamber
may be turned in the accordance with the aim of the stimulated emission in progress.
Of course, such turning is not possible for every Echo Chamber. Some of them are
stable w.r.t. to their basic quasi-colors.
Let us consider functioning of some Internet-based Echo Chamber; for example,
one that is based on some s-group in Facebook and composed of s-atoms. The degree
of their indistinguishability can vary depending on the concrete Echo Chamber. Say,
namesarestillpresentinFacebook,buttheyhavesomemeaningonlyfortherestricted
circleoffriends;inInstagramorSnapchat,evennamesdisappearands-atomsoperate
just with nicknames.
By a s-group we understand some sub-network of say Facebook, for example,
s-group “Quantum Physics”. The main feature of a s-group is that all posts and
comments are visible for all members of this s-group. Thus, if I put the post “Getting
rid of nonlocality from quantum physics”, then it would be visible for all members
of this s-group, and they would be able to put their own comments or posts related
to my initiation post. This is simpliﬁcation of the general structure of posting in
Facebook, with constraints that are set by clustering into “friends” and “followers”.
We assume that the ensemble of s-atoms of this Echo Chamber approached popu-
lation inversion, so the majority of them are already excited. A batch of communica-
tions of the same quasi-color α and carrying quanta of s-energy Ec = Ea is injected
in the Echo Chamber. Excited s-atoms interact with the stimulating communications
and, with some probability, emit information excitations of the same quasi-color as
the injected stimulators. These emitted quanta of s-energy are represented in the
form of new posts in Echo Chamber’s s-group. Each post plays the role of a mirror,
it reﬂects the information excitation that has generated this post.
However, the analogy with the optics may be misleading. In classical optics, each
light ray is reﬂected by the mirror again as one ray. In quantum optics, each photon
reﬂected by the mirror is again just one photon. An ideal mirror reﬂects all photons,
the real one absorbs some of them.
In contrast, “the mirror of an Echo Chamber”, the information mirror, is s-energy
multiplier. A physical analog of such a multiplier works as follows. Each light ray is
reﬂected as a batch of rays or in the quantum picture, matching the situation better,
each photon by interacting with such a mirror generates a batch of photons. Of course,
the usual physical mirror cannot reﬂect more photons than the number of incoming
ones, due to the energy conservation law. Hence, the discussed device is hypothetical.
The Internet-based system of posting news and communications works as a mul-
tiplier. Each posted news or communication emits a batch of “information rays”
directed to all possible receivers—the s-atoms of Echo Chamber’s s-group who are
active at this time. In the quantum model, each post works as an information analog
of the photon’s emitter. It emits quanta of s-energy, the power of the information
ﬁeld increases. Consequently excited s-atoms emit their own posts and comments

178
11
Social Laser
with higher probability. We repeat that new posts have the same quasi-color as the
initiating information excitations that were injected in the Echo Chamber.
By reaction we understood emission of a new message, say a comment. If s-
atom simply reads a posted communication, but does not emit its own information
excitation, then we do not consider such reading as a reaction. For the moment, we
consider only the process of stimulated emission. Later we shall consider absorption
as well. In the latter, reaction means transition from the ground state to the excited
state; so, not simply reading. In fact, a relaxed s-atom can read a post or a comment
without absorbing a quantum of s-energy sufﬁcient for approaching the state of
excitement.
11.8
Illustrating Examples
In this section, we would like to illustrate previous theoretical considerations by the
additional examples of social laser’s use at the modern socio-political arena, potential
and real uses.
A Societal Beneﬁt Laser
In the previous works on the social laser [267–290], we main attention was paid to
its destructive power. This apparatus for social engineering was considered merely
from SASA-viewpoint. A social-information tsunami can be not less destructive
than a physical tsunami. And nowadays the destructive power of social-information
tsunamis is essentially higher than the power of ocean’s waves.
After my lecture at the event “Quantum Social Science Bootcamp’s 22”,3 graduate
and post-graduate students were curious about the social laser potential for generation
of something good for people, so to say “the waves of love” between people, e.g., to
stopthewarsinSyriaorUkraine,tostruggleagainstpovertyinAfrica,LatinAmerica,
India, or to intensify the struggle against destruction of planet’s ecological system.
During the discussion we quickly came to the common conclusion that although
theoretically it is possible to generate societal beneﬁt lasing, practical realization is
difﬁcult.
As was already pointed out, the energy gap Ea in typical s-atom of the modern
society is very big. We are living in the highly energetic society. Hence, the energy
pumping has to be done with highly s-energetic infons (say communications, news).
The main source of human psychic (mental) energy are our basic instincts. Messages
carrying horror, anger, fear, hate deliver huge amounts of the psychic energy which
can be later (at the stage of stimulating emission) transferred into the s-energy. It

11.8 Illustrating Examples
179
is not easy to create highly s-energetic messages with quasi-color α = “societal
beneﬁt”.
During the aforementioned discussion after my lecture, one master student
remarked that why not to use highly energetic communications with “terrible con-
tent” to approach the population inversion and then to start stimulating emission with
a batch (quasi-) colored with α = “societal beneﬁt”? Theoretically it can be done
(see Sect.11.5 on the possibility to pump s-energy with α-quasi-colored infons and
perform the stimulated emission with beta-quasi-colored infons, α ̸= β. The main
obstacle to such s-engineering “transferring bad into good” is that the stimulating
infons must carry big amounts of s-energy matching Ea which is assumed to be
big in the modern society. If “excitation’s color is not purple enough”, then s-atoms
would simply ignore such infons, even if mass media and s-networks would start to
generate them intensively.
Atthesametime,wecanpointtosuchsociallasingcampaignsfor“socialbeneﬁts”
assay“MeToo”,or“BlackLivesMatter”,or“CriticalRaceTheory”.So,sociallasing
tsunamis in social-information space can serve for social beneﬁts.
The sexual instinct is also one of the basic instincts, and it can serve as a source of
both s-energy pumping to approach the population inversion in human gain medium
and to start the stimulated emission. This instinct played the important role in the
hippie motion in 1960. This motion dynamics had some features of social lasing,
although in the absence of internet s-resonators were not advanced. However, instead
of the internet based Echo Chambers, youngsters used physical meetings with joint
camping, festivals, creation of hippie communities. And we repeat once again that
the sexual instinct was heavily involved in s-energy generation and transmission.
COVID-19 Protests
During the COVID-19 pandemic, the human gain medium was overheated by the
shock news about the spread of this terrible disease, by its deadly consequences,
by life during lockdowns, and numerous rigid restrictions on social life (e.g., masks
in public places and somewhere, e.g., OAE, even at the streets), by the QR-codes
and obligatory vaccination for some professions, e.g., the personal of hospitals. Such
communications were often repeated a few times, their content could vary, but not the
basic quasi-color, α = COVID-19. In some countries, even the most democratic ones
as in Sweden, the laws were changed by restricting the basic freedoms, including the
basic constitutional right for meetings and demonstrations.
Scientists also actively contributed in generation COVID-19 fear. For example,
some mathematical models of disease spread predicted millions of deaths from
COVID-19 in UK and hundreds of thousands in Sweden, if the rigid restrictions,
including lockdowns and masks would not be invented [146, 151].
My personal opinion is that such the mathematical models were really primitive,
basicallytheveryoldSIR-dynamics (maybedisturbedbyastochastictermfor noise).
This is the good place to mention the new model of disease spread [293, 294, 296]; it

180
11
Social Laser
took into account the social cluster structure of population. This model predicted the
opposite effect, comparing with the majority of models, of lockdowns and other rigid
restrictions. In contrast to, e.g., [146, 151], such restrictions slowdown approaching
of natural immunity in human population (cf. with conventional predictions [82–84].
By summarizing we can say that at the end of the year 2020 and the beginning
of the year 2021, the state of population inversion was approached in European
countries, Australia, Canada, USA, and Russia. The human gain medium was ready
for radiating a huge spike of s-energy, a spike which could destroy the basics of
society. Various s-groups and individuals started to generate information excita-
tions against WHO’s COVID-19 policy and their governments following this policy.
Social networks resonated these excitations. This led to generation of local spikes of
protests, world-wide and especially in Australia, Germany, the Netherlands, France,
UK, Canada, and even Sweden (see, e.g., [104, 445]). (In Sweden, the COVID-19
restrictions were really mild by comparing with majority of countries: no lockdowns,
no masks.) Powerful SASA was about to start world-wide.
However, extended suppression of functioning of the social resonators, espe-
cially by YouTube and Twitter, prevented creation of the global wave of protests. At
the same time, the local spikes relaxed some portions of s-energy and in this way
s-temperature was lowed.
Pro-war and Pro-peace Beaming: Competitions of Stimulated
Emissions
Coming back to societal beneﬁt lasing theme, consider a war between two countries
or blocks of countries. And suppose that some group of policy makers wants to use the
sociallasertechnologytogeneratethewaveofpeacefulthoughtsandactions.Assume
that this group is powerful enough to generate a strong injection of communications
for peace. In principle, it is possible to connect with a message having quasi-color
α = “peace” big amount of s-energy. Unfortunately, to generate such social lasing
for peace the war should be going for sufﬁciently long time. And it should lead to big
casualties from both sides or at least from one of them. Otherwise even spontaneously
emitted hate cascade would destroy the processes of stimulation of a cascade of
thoughts and actions for peace.
Here we come to the problem of competing stimulation in human gain medium
approached the state of population inversion.
The main problem in starting such process is that another group at the political
arena might not be interested to end this war. By using their information resources
they could continue social lasing in favor of the war, α = “war”. And the aggression
instinct is so powerful that there is a big chance that such the α = “war” beam of
social laser would be essentially stronger than the α = “peace” beam.
In such competition of s-energy beams of two quasi-colors, the crucial role is
played by social resonators, in the form of s-networks based on YouTube, Facebook,

11.8 Illustrating Examples
181
Live Journal, Bastion, Twitter, Telegram, Instagram, Yandex, Vkontakte, and so
on. Therefore, it is so important to control such information resources (e.g., one
can understand the motivation of Elon Musk to buy Twitter). Without the control
of social resonators, it is practically impossible to start stimulating emission. The
initial (stimulating) batch of information excitations which is not supported by social
resonators would pass through information space in a ﬂash and disappear. As was
stressed in [335],
The dissemination and control of information are indispensable ingredients of violent con-
ﬂict, with all parties involved in a conﬂict or at war seeking to frame the discussion on
their own terms. Those attempts at information control often involve the dissemination of
misinformation or disinformation (i.e., information that is incorrect by accident or intent,
respectively).
Therefore, it is not surprising that Elon Mask was ready to spend 43 billion dollars
to buy Twitter.
Russian-Ukrainian War and Relaxation of COVID-19
Generated Social Energy
Now we turn again to the COVID-19 pandemic. During the years 2020–21 human
society collected a lot of s-energy and approached the state of population inversion.
Of course, the state of population inversion was not approached in whole world;
say in Egypt and other African countries COVID-19 did not lead to massive tran-
sition of people into the excited state. We speak about this transition in European
countries (both West and East Europe), USA, Canada, Australia. It is interesting that
in China, in spite of very high degree of COVID-19 related restrictions, generally the
mental state of population could not be characterized as excited. Chinese population
took these restrictions rather calmly by following automatically COVID-19 state
recommendations, as people here would do in any other case. On the other hand,
the mass protests of Canadian track-drivers demonstrated that the degree of social
tensions in Canadian society was very high. These protests can be considered as a
test of COVID-19 generated instability in Western society.
West society’s stability was saved only due to diminishing the activity of social
resonators via the direct censorship as well as mobilization of police forces to termi-
nate demonstrations and protests that happened in physical space. The social lasing
in the form of the COVID-19 protests was put on hole. But the society was in the
unstable state; any stimulated or even spontaneous emission could start tsunami in
information space with transmission of its social power into physical space.
One can speculate that only the war between Russia and Ukraine relaxed the huge
amount of s-energy collected during the pandemic in Europe, USA, Canada, Russia,
and Ukraine. The COVID-19 energy was transferred into the war energy. Here we
discussed mainly the processes in social-information space, i.e., not the real war

182
11
Social Laser
battles in physical space. In February, March, and April of the year 2022, the war
ignited the real information tsunami in mass media and s-networks, the massive ﬂows
of s-energy were radiated wold-wide. This is the excellent example of the possibility
to relax s-energy collected within α1 quasi-colored information campaign via a new
stimulating emission which is quasi-colored with totally different quasi-color α2.
But, as always in socio-political studies, it is impossible to exclude that the sequence
COVID-19→war was just the occasional ﬂow of events.
Russian-Ukrainian Information War: Competing Beams
of Social Radiation
It is interesting that the war generated two powerful beams of radiation—two rays
of social lasing. The rays had the opposite quasi-colors, anti-and pro-Russia quasi-
colors, αaR, αpR. These social lasing rays were stimulated by mass media of West-
ern countries, Ukraine and Russia and they were ampliﬁed by the corresponding
Echo Chambers. Echo Chambers were Internet-based. Russian government tried to
block some pro-Western social resonators. It was not able to block concrete Echo
Chambers or individual bloggers, since the Internet resources were controlled by the
Western corporations. So, the Russian government chosen the strategy of the total
blockade of some resources, say Facebook, Instagram, Linkedin. It even planned
to block YouTube, but ﬁnally decided not to do this and to use this internet system
for own purposes. Surprisingly similar strategy was applied by Western govern-
ments to some Russian resources, e.g., to “Russia Today” TV channel. European and
American bloggers and, e.g., YouTube channels delivering information excitations
of αR quasi-color (or excitations which might be interpreted as having such quasi-
color) were accused in supporting the Russian war propaganda. In particular, we
can mention American conservative TV and YouTube channels as say FOX News.
And YouTube and Facebook also massively block videos of Russian (typically state
coupled) bloggers, especially delivering the news of military operations at Ukraine.
At the same time YouTube was actively used by Russia, the state employed bloggers
delivered pro-Russia colored news, comments, event-interpretations about the war.
Pro-Western resources were deﬁnitely more powerful and covered wider population
throughout the world, including some shifts of Russian youngsters. Some Arabic,
Indian, Latin American, and Chinese channels generated αR−communications. The
latter was important for the active part of Russian patriotic population, since it made
the feeling that Russia is not isolated at the world’s political arena. Especially impor-
tant was functioning of American conservative channels, as say Fox News. Such
channels by criticizing the Biden administration contributed to the αpR−beam of
war-radiation.
The war-lasing also illustrated the possibility to generate two laser beams from
different population clusters. Such multi-beam social lasing is an interesting problem
which deserves the special study. One of the sources of multi-beam lasing is sharp

clustering of modern population into big clusters coupled to distinct Echo Chambers,
used for ampliﬁcation of different laser beams.
For example, the majority of Russians and Ukrainians are still rigidly coupled to
the state owned or supported information resources (including bloggers and “pri-
vate channels”). It is interesting that Russians ignore practically completely the
Ukrainian internet channels, even the Russian speaking ones; the same can be said
about Ukrainians who generally understand well Russian and in principle may follow
pro-Russian bloggers and channels. But mostly there is no interest for creation of
the international picture of the situation. Why?
One of the reasons is that Internet became the very dangerous place. Nowadays the
information space is not less dangerous than physical space. For a “wrong” video,
comment, and even like one can be heavily punished and in Russia and Ukraine
“wrong” Internet-message can lead to prison and for many years. However, fear of
punishment is not crucial in generation of information clustering of population.
Reddit Against Wall Street
For those who didn’t know or forgot the story about a s-network uprising against
Wall Street, we recall some details by following [344].
GameStop is a US video game retailer that has lost much of its market share to online trade
and whose stock plummeted from $56 a share in 2013 to about $5 in 2019. Some big hedge
funds decided that they would cash in on GameStop’s misery by shorting its shares. A short
is a bet that an asset, such as a share, will decline in price. It’s a manoeuvre that can generate
huge proﬁts. But if the asset price doesn’t fall, investors can also lose a lot of money.
A bunch of Reddit geeks on the online forum r/wallstreetbets, an investment discussion group
that boasts more than 6 million users, decided to buy GameStop shares en masse. Perhaps
they saw it as an investment, perhaps they were bored, perhaps they wanted to inﬂict pain
on Wall Street. Whatever the reason, the consequence was to push GameStop’s share price
up. And up. Once it became a global story, others piled in too, boosting the share price from
about 40 to almost 400 in a matter of days. As a result, big investors lost big... . The story,
however, is not just about traders getting their comeuppance, but also about the absurdity of
the stock market.
To analyze this event, we shall appeal to social laser theory with its application
to s-atoms operating at the ﬁnancial market. In this framework this “global story”
demonstrated not the absurdity of the stock market, but rather the possibility to
use new ﬁnancial technology for generation of short squeezing. And as usually,
this GameStop short squeezing generated huge proﬁts for those who designed and
ignited the process of stimulated ampliﬁcation of coherent s-actions. In this case “s-
actions” were posting comments at Reddit expressing believes (hopes, instructions)
that GameStopp shares will go up in price. These were actions in the information
space. They led to actions in the ﬁnancial space—buying of GameStopp shares.
We ﬁnalize this short consideration of Reddit “uprising” by a few citations from
media-sources [411]:

Social Laser
And though the share price dipped on Monday, Feb. 1, by more than 30%, many Reddit
users say they’re buying more GameStop stock, convinced it’ll rocket even higher. Jaime
Rogozinski, the apparent founder of the Reddit community at the heart of all this, told The
Wall Street Journal it’s like ‘a train wreck happening in real time.’ Keith Gill, the trader in
the Reddit community who helped kick off the battle, told the paper he ‘didn’t expect this.’
There might be something cathartic in watching the wolves of Wall Street themselves being
savaged, but we should not romanticise the Reddit geeks. This was not an ‘uprising’ or ‘the
French Revolution of ﬁnance’, as Donald Trump’s former communications director Anthony
Scaramucci absurdly described it, but a scheme to play professional investors at their own
game. [Guardian]

Losses, Coefﬁcient of Reﬂection-multiplication
Asinphysicallasing,theaboveidealschemeiscomplicatedbyafewfactorsrelatedto
losses of s-energy in the Echo Chamber. As is known, not all photons are reﬂected by
mirrors of the optical cavity, a part of them is absorbed by the mirrors. The coefﬁcient
of reﬂection plays the fundamental role. The same problem arises in social lasing. An
essential part of posts is absorbed by the information mirror of the Echo Chamber:
for some posts, the probability that they would be read by members of the s-group is
practically zero. Additional (essential) loss of s-energy resulted from getting rid of
communications carrying quasi-colors different from the quasi-color α of the bunch
of the communications initiating the feedback dynamics in the Echo Chamber. Such
communications are generated by spontaneous emission of atoms in the s-group.
Therealmodelisevenmorecomplex.Theinformationmirrorisnothomogeneous,
“areas of its surface” differ by the degree of readability and reaction. The areas can be
either rigidly incorporated in the structure of the s-group or be formed in the process
of its functioning.
As an example of functionally created information layers, we can point to ones
which are coupled to the names of some members of the s-group, say “area” related
to the posts of a Nobel Prize Laureate has a high degree of readability and reaction.
But, of course, one does not need to be such a big name to approach a high level of
readability and reaction. For example, even in science the strategy of active following
to the main stream speculations can have a very good effect. Top bloggers and
YouTubers create areas of the information mirror with high coefﬁcients of reﬂection-
multiplication (see below (11.14)) through collecting subscriptions to their blogs and
YouTube channels.
It is clear that the probability of readability and reaction to a post depends heavily
on the area of its location in the information space of a s-group or generally Facebook,
YouTube, or Instagram. The reﬂection-multiplication coefﬁcient of the information
mirror varies essentially.

11.9 Technical Details
185
Consider ﬁrst the physical mirror and photons reﬂected by it. From the very
beginning, it is convenient to consider an inhomogeneous mirror with the reﬂection
coefﬁcient depending on mirror’s layers. Suppose that k-photons are emitted to area
x and n of them were reﬂected, i.e., (k −n) were absorbed. Then the probability of
reﬂection by this area
P(x) ≈n/k, for large k.
(11.13)
Now, for the information mirror, consider a sequence of posts, j = 1, 2, ..., k, that
were put in its area x. Let n j denotes the number of group’s members who reacts
to post j. Each n j varies between 0 and N, where N is the total number of group’s
members. Then coefﬁcient of reﬂection-multiplication
P(x) ≈(
k

j
n j)/kN, for large k, N.
(11.14)
If practically all posts generate reactions of practically all members of the group,
then n j ≈N and P(x) ≈1.
Improvement of Coherence: Direct and Indirect Filtering
We have already discussed in detail the multilayer structure of the information mirror
of an Echo Chamber. This is one of the basic information structures giving the possi-
bility to generate inside it the information ﬁeld of the very high degree of coherence:
a very big wave of information excitations of the same quasi-color, the quasi-color
of stimulating communications. It is sufﬁcient to stimulate atoms having the poten-
tial of posting in the areas of the information surface having the high coefﬁcients
of reﬂection-multiplication. These areas would generate a huge information wave
directed to the rest of the s-group.
Spontaneously emitted communications would be directed to areas with the low
coefﬁcients of reﬂection-multiplication. How is this process directed by the Internet
engines? It is described by the model of the dynamical evaluation of the readability
history of a post. We shall turn to this model in Sect.11.9.
Although the dynamical evaluation plays the crucial role in generating the coher-
ent information waves, one has not to ignore the impact of straightforward ﬁltering.
We again use the analogy with physics. In the process of lasing, the dynamical
feedback process in the cavity excludes the excitation of the electromagnetic ﬁeld
propagating in the wrong directions. In this way, laser generates the sharply directed
beam of light. However, one may want some additional speciﬁcation for excitations
in the light beam. For example, one wants that all photons would be of the same
polarization. It can be easily done by putting the additional ﬁlter, the polarization ﬁl-
ter, that eliminates from the beam all photons with “wrong polarization”. Of course,
the use of an additional ﬁlter would weaker the power of the output beam. The latter

186
11
Social Laser
is the price for coherence increasing. In social lasing, the role of such polarization
ﬁlters is played by say Google, Facebook, Instagram, or Yandex control ﬁltering,
e.g., with respect to the political correctness constraints. Besides numerous mod-
erators, this ﬁltering system uses the keywords search engines as well as the rigid
system of “self-control”. In the latter, users report on “wrongly (quasi-)colored posts
and comments” of each other; the reports are directed both to the provider and to
s-groups—to attract the attention to such posts and comments.
Dynamical Evaluation System
The dynamical evaluation system used, e.g., by YouTube, increases post’s visibility
on the basis of its reading history, more readings imply higher visibility (at least the-
oretically). However, the multilayer structure of the information mirror of YouTube
should also be taken into account.
The main internet-platforms assign high visibility to biggest actors of the mass
media, say BBC, EuroNews, RT, that started to use actively these platforms. Then,
andthis maybeevenmoreimportant, theseinternet-platforms assignhighvisibilityto
the most popular topics, say nowadays the coronavirus epidemy, videos, posts, and
comments carrying this quasi-color are elevated automatically in the information
mirrors of Google, YouTube, or Yandex.
Of course, the real evaluation system of the main internet actors is more com-
plicated and the aforementioned dynamical evaluation system is only one of its
components, may be very important. We would never get the answer to the question
so widely discussed in communities of bloggers and YouTubers: How are the claims
on unfair policy of the internet-platforms justiﬁed? By unfair policy they under-
stand assigning additional readings and likes to some internet-communications or
withdraw some of them from other communications.
11.10
Social Spin
Electrons in an atom have spin and photons of the electromagnetic ﬁeld have
polarization—the analog of spin. For simplicity, we will speak about spins of elec-
trons and photons. Spin is characterized by the direction of some axis in three-
dimensional space. The notion of spin is the quantum mechanical counterpart of the
notion of the angular momentum of a classical particle. The latter has not only a
magnitude (how fast the body is rotating), but also a direction (either up or down on
the axis of rotation of the particle). Spin represents an axis via its projections. The
crucial point is that spin’s projections on coordinate axes can only take the discrete
values:
{ℏsi :
si ∈{−s, −(s −1), . . . , s −1, s}},

11.10 Social Spin
187
where i = x, y, z (the coordinate axes) and s is the quantity known as the principal
spin quantum number [353, pp. 372–373]. Another distinguished feature of quantum
spin is that this quantity, as any quantum quantity, can be treated only in terms of
observations. Each spin’s projection is represented by an operator Si. These operators
do not commute. Hence they cannot be jointly measurable; in particular, the joint
probability distribution for their outcomes is not well deﬁned. So, the classical image
as the angular momentum vector can be misleading, but our imagination cannot
produce anything better. Physicists often speak about spin vector. It is more correct to
speak about spin in some direction: to select some direction in the three-dimensional
space v = (v1, v2, v3) and consider the operator of spin projection on this axis Sv.
The energy exchange between the electromagnetic ﬁeld and an atom depends on
spins’ structure of the electrons in an atom and photons in the ﬁeld. Their spins
should match each another, otherwise neither absorption nor emission can happen.
In social laser model developed up to now, this spin structure is not taken into
account,althoughitisnaturaltoassumethatboths-atomsandinformationexcitations
are “oriented along some social axes” and they interact only when their orientation
axes are close. It is natural (by following the socio-physical methodology) to call
such axes social spins. Of course, the quantum-like model is more complicated, since,
as we know from quantum physics, spin cannot be mathematically described as a
vector. We can operate only with spin operators, the spin projection operators.
So, we propose the following heuristic picture. People have their personal social
axes as well as information excitations (carried by communications, news, messages,
posts in s-networks, comments to these posts). The degree of interaction between
s-atoms and information excitations depends on matching of their social axes. As
in physics, the processes are probabilistic, small angles between axes imply higher
probabilities of absorption and emission, if directions are opposite, then probability
of interaction is practically zero. Once again, as in physics, the picture of axes is too
naive, one has to translate it to the operator language and work with projections.
The social-political preferences of the majority of American population can be
described by one axis; say spin up and down encode the liberal and conservative
views respectively. (I am sorry by encoding the conservative preferences as “social
spin down”. We can encode spins another way around.) If a s-atom (say from Califor-
nia) has the spin up preference, then she would not react to a communication carrying
the conservative preference; similarly a s-atom (say from Arizona) with spin down
preferences would not react to an information excitation about, e.g., climate change.
In the human gain medium consisting of liberal s-atoms, one cannot start stimulated
emission by sending a batch of information excitations with social spin down. Such
liberal atoms would neither react to radiation emitted by conservative Echo Cham-
bers. Of course, the majority of spin up s-atoms are simply disconnected from such
Echo Chambers But even by meeting occasionally an information excitation with
spin down, a liberal s-atom would not interact with it; moreover even high density
ﬂow of such information excitations would not stimulate spin up s-atoms to emit or
absorb quanta of s-energy.

Thenaturalquestionabouttheoriginofspininahumanarises.Westressthatsocial
spin is a stable quantity. Typically a person is keeping with liberal (or conservative)
values during many years, or even during the whole life.
As always, there are exceptions from any rule. For example, Donald Trump
changed his views completely and moved from the Democratic Party to the Repub-
lican Party. However, this case is so unusual that some Republicans claimed that
Trump played the role of Trojan Horse; he inﬁltrated into the Republican Party to
destroy its image, in particular, by his eclectic speeches and posts in Twitter.
The basic question is whether human’s spin has the biological or social basis?
or their combination? We do not know the answer. Heuristically human spin is
determined by the s-environment (therefore, we called it social spin). But it is even
possible that human spin is determined by her genome and physiology of organism’s
functioning.
In any event, it is clear that the present theory of social laser must be developed
to take into account the social analog of quantum spin.
11.11
Concluding Remarks On Social Laser
We hope that this chapter would be useful for researchers working both in humani-
tarian and natural sciences. In this book, the methodology of social laser theory was
enriched through the invention of infon. This is an analog of photon. Photons are the
excitations of the quantum electromagnetic ﬁeld, and infons are the excitations of
the quantum social-information ﬁeld.
We emphasize the bosonic nature of these ﬁelds which is the basic factor leading
to the generation of the cascade process of the stimulated emission in the lasers’ gain
media, both physical and human.
The infons-language is convenient to describe the dynamics of cascades’ iterations
within social laser-the gain medium and resonator. Social resonators are implemented
by coupling laser’s gain medium to s-networks. We emphasize the role of resonators
in, e.g., lasing for the competing candidates in the presidential elections. Generally,
we are interested in the process of creation of two competing beams of s-actions, as
the mentioned elections or war and peace beams in contemporary information space.
As well as in article [290], we highlight the role of Internet-based Echo Chambers
in increase of the amplitude as well as color and quasi-color coherence of the beams
of social radiation. Echo Chambers are also used to increase temporal coherence, to
make the spike of social radiation sharply concentrated in the time domain. It is the
good place to point out that Internet-based resonator is a kind of active mirror, in
contrast to the optical cavities with the reﬂecting mirrors.
Once again (cf. with [267, 290]) we highlighted the possibility to supply s-energy
to the gain medium with infons of the quasi-color different from the quasi-color of
infons in the stimulating injection (and hence the output beam of social radiation).
This property of s-atoms is called memeorylessness. It plays the important role in
social engineering. The real aim of social lasing can be deemed at least at the stage of

11.11 Concluding Remarks On Social Laser

s-energy pumping in the gain medium. Moreover, s-energy produced by one social
laser can be used at the stage of approaching population inversion in another social
laser. In turn the latter can be used for new social laser and so on ... ; say the “climate
change beam” of social radiation was used for the A-state of COVD-19 social lasing,
in terms of the s-energy emitted by the latter was directed to create the “war beam”.
The natural question arises:
What kind of social lasing may be expected after the war?

Stability in Biological, Ecological,
and Social Systems via Fröhlich
Condensation
12.1
Modeling of Fröhlich Condensation
As was demonstrated by Fröhlich [157–159, 161, 162], some biosystems can
approach the stationary energy state through the process of phonons’ condensa-
tion on the lowest vibrational mode—the Fröhlich condensation(see also for review
Vasconcellos et al., 2012, and references in it). This stabilization is approached not
through system’s isolation, but through sufﬁciently intensive energy pumping and
an energy exchange between different vibration modes (energy levels) of a biosys-
tem and with the surrounding heat reservoir E. Such a biosystem can preserve its
stability, despite permanent energy supply, and it neither totally relaxes to the state
of thermodynamic equilibrium with E:
. . . under appropriate conditions a phenomenon quite similar to a Bose condensation may
occur in substances which possess longitudinal electric modes. If energy is fed into these
modes and thence transferred to other degrees of freedom of the substance, then a stationary
state will be reached in which the energy content of the electric modes is larger than in the
thermal equilibrium. This excess energy is found to be channelled into a single mode–exactly
as in Bose condensation–provided the energy supply exceeds a critical value. Under these
circumstances a random supply of energy is thus not completely thermalized but partly used
in maintaining a coherent electric wave in the substance.
Fröhlich [158].
This process has some similarity with the process of the Bose–Einstein conden-
sation. The crucial difference between them is that the Fröhlich condensation is
reached by systems in the heat reservoirs with sufﬁciently high temperature which
are exposed to sufﬁciently intensive energy supply. One can say that Bose–Einstein
and Fröhlich condensations are the passages to stability through freezing and high
temperature energy exchange, respectively. Since biosystems frozen to very low tem-
perature are dead, the phenomenon of the Fröhlich condensation is more interesting
from the biological viewpoint.

12.1.1
Coherent Vibrations in Biomolecules and Cells
The basic example of the systems with Fröhlich condensation are giant dipole oscil-
lators in macromolecules inside a cell, e.g., proteins or genomes; solution in a cell is
their heat reservoir E. Energy supply to a cell is electromagnetic and chemical. The
giant dipoles approach synchronized oscillations at the lowest energy mode, which
is nevertheless essentially higher than the average energy of excitations in E . And
behavior of the whole macromolecule is characterized by coherence of oscillations
or in terms of energy, by coherence of the energy distribution.
Starting with such systems, Fröhlich [157–159, 161, 162] extended the domain of
applicability of his theory to the level of cells composing body’s organs, e.g., lever.
In all cells of this organ, all dipoles in macromolecules are involved in the coherent
ﬂuctuations. This regime leads to synchronization of all biological processes in an
organ. In [162], it was emphasized that
Many other types of physical order may be imposed on certain systems when they are lifted
from their thermal equilibrium state even though they are spatially disordered. This does not
hold, however, for all systems, and no general criteria has been found, so far, which when
satisﬁed permits particular systems to exhibit some type of order when energy is supplied
to them. Most systems, however, simply raise their temperature. Biological materials, when
they exhibit typical biological properties, must be ‘fed’, i.e., energy passes through them.
This energy may arise from chemical processes, or it may be supplied by the Sun.
So, biosystems have some specialties which generally are not characteristic of
physical systems. The aim of this paper is to formulate such specialties in the frame-
work of information biology.
12.1.2
Long-Range Nonlinear Interactions
Fröhlich used the methods of nonequilibrium thermodynamics, the condensation
corresponds to the stationary state which is far from equilibrium; cf. [446]. Such
states are generated by nonlinear dynamics for energy exchange between systems
coupled via long-range nonlinear interactions, e.g., of Coulomb’s type. Straightfor-
ward mathematical modeling of such dynamics is the complex problem. Therefore,
the statistical methods are useful, and their application led Fröhlich to his discovery.
Quantum theory provides one of the most powerful tools for statistical modeling,
with the quantum master equation for the density operator. For Fröhlich conden-
sation, the quantum model was developed, for example, in articles [440, 470]. In
particular, the quantum approach rigorously formalized the original thermodynamic
considerations of Fröhlich. The phenomenon of coherent vibrations in biomolecules
was studied with open quantum systems theory and its quantum modeling has a lot
in common with laser theory, see article [440] for exploration of this commonality.

12.1 Modeling of Fröhlich Condensation
193
12.1.3
Quantum-Like Modeling of Fröhlich Condensation
Our aim is to show that the range of applicability of Fröhlich’s theory can be extended
to macroscopic biosystems, including the ecological and social systems. The possi-
bility of such extension was indirectly mentioned in the original works of Fröh-
lich. The analysis of cancer’s generation [162] was done in the abstract frame-
work by discussing the collective modes regulating behavior of cells in an organ.
Originally such modes were identiﬁed with frequencies or vibration energies in
dipoles in biomolecules, but the condensation model was not rigidly coupled to
vibrations [162]:
it will be noticed that the term ‘collective mode’ might be given a different physical inter-
pretation from the one suggested here, provided individual cells have collective properties
which enable them to react to collective model and which could be destroyed by external
inﬂuences.
See also [184].
Quantum physical modeling [440, 470] of coherent synchronization of dipoles in
say DNA molecule belongs to the domain of the standard applications of quantum
theory. Its extension to macroscopic biosystems is not straightforward, a variety of
methodological and interpretational problems must be resolved. This can be done in
the framework of quantum-like modeling. As was already pointed out a few times,
in this approach the physical structure of a system is not crucial; only the way of
information processing is important. In some situations, the mathematical formalism
of quantum theory matches better the structure of processed information. Then, it is
pragmatically natural to use the quantum operator description. We do not claim that
such situations cannot be described classically. The quantum-like formalism gives
the possibility to model the Fröhlich condensation for arbitrary collective modes
from proteins and cells to ecological and social systems, by using the calculus of
creation and annihilation operators. This calculus is basic in quantum theory of
the Fröhlich condensate and laser physics [440, 470]. We apply it in the general
information framework, with the operators of creation and annihilation of the social
and behavioral excitations.
12.1.4
Fröhlich Condensation of Information Excitations
As in the previous chapters, biosystems are considered as information processors and
quantum-like modeling is used to describe information processing within the quan-
tum mathematical formalism. Instead of photons and phonons, we consider quanta of
information, each carries a few attributes. The latter determines the collective modes
for condensation. As is standard in quantum theory, at least with the Copenhagen
interpretation, these modes are invented as observables, and not as objective proper-
ties of information processors. For simplicity, we consider just a single mode; say A
with the spectrum (the range of values)

Biosystems, information processors (I-processors), absorb and emit information
excitations with amplitudes given by the differences between A-lines, ai j = (ai −
a j). And the information Fröhlich condensation is creation of the stationary state
corresponding to the minimal nonzero value, A = a1.
12.2
Review on Fröhlich’s Works
Fröhlich [157–159, 161, 162] considered a biosystem containing the following com-
ponents:
1. Oscillating segments of giant dipoles in macromolecules.
2. A heat bath; say protein molecular in a cell ﬁlled with solution.
The system is open, and it is exposed by an external energy pump directed to the
oscillating units. They are characterized by the frequency band:
ω1 < · · · < ωn.
(12.2)
For the further considerations, it is convenient to give the description solely in terms
of energy. Frequency modes (12.2) can be associated with the corresponding energy
band:
E1a < · · · < Ena.
(12.3)
Oscillations of single units can be described by appropriate superposition of these
waves. In Fröhlich’s papers, the waves were treated as classical vibration waves. In
quantum and quantum-like models, one considers superposition of the energy states
|E ja⟩:
|ψ⟩==

j
c j|E ja⟩,

j
|c j|2 = 1.
(12.4)
(3) Fröhlich [162] did not emphasize the dipole nature of oscillating subsystems. He
called them simply ‘units’:
Consider a suspension of a large number of units in a substance which will be treated as a
heat bath.
And this terminology is convenient for quantum-like modeling.
The external energy pump is characterized by supplies Ji to the corresponding
energy modes; it was supposed that supply is uniform w.r.t. to the energy band, i.e.,
Ji = J (the mode-homogeneous supply). The heat reservoir is assumed to be in the
state of the thermodynamical equilibrium characterized by the Planck formula for the
average number Nib of excitations corresponding to each energy mode—reservoir’s
spectrum is discrete:

(12.6)
where λ is the energy scale parameter. In thermodynamics, the energy scaling param-
eter λ is represented as λ = K T, where T is bath temperature, K is the Boltzmann
constant.
Each unit exchanges energy with the heat bath; this is an exchange of energy in
quanta (discreteness of energy transfer). The net rate of loss L1i of the mode with
energy Eia (containing ni quanta) is written as
L1i = φ[nie
Eia
λ −(1 + ni)],
(12.7)
where the coefﬁcient φ > 0 encodes interaction of (bio-)units with the bath (e.g.,
solution in a cell).
Of course, besides this straightforward interaction with the heat bath, the units are
involved into the energy exchange between different modes and the bath: emission
and absorption of Eia-energy excitation. The net range of loss L2i of the mode Eia
due to such processes can be written in the form:
L2i = χ

where χ is the transition probability, it generally depends on the indexes i, k, but, for
simplicity, Fröhlich neglected by this dependence. He remarked that this assumption
essentially simpliﬁes calculations, but it does not inﬂuence the result.
The quantities L1i, L2i were phenomenologically selected to match the require-
ment that in the absence of energy supply, J = 0, thermal equilibrium

Here the Bose–Einstein statistics of the equilibrium state is assumed (see Chap. 18).
The condition of stationarity in the presence of external energy supply and heat bath
in the state of thermodynamical equilibrium can be written in the form of equation:
J = L1i + L2i.

j n j is the total number of the energy excitations in the system. We recall
that J is the intensity of energy pumping which is assumed to be the same for all
modes. It can be proven that the coefﬁcient V ≤1 and, hence, it can be represented
in the form:
V = e−μ/λ,

where in thermodynamics the quantity 0 ≤μ ≤E1a is the chemical potential . Thus,
ni has the form
ni =

(12.14)
Up to now we worked with the standard balance equation and its stationary state
under condition of the Bose–Einstein distribution of energy in the heat bath. The
condensation to the E1a-mode takes place when chemical potential μ approaches
E1a very closely. This can be approached in the high temperature regime
K T >> E1a.
(12.15)
Thus, the temperature of the heat bath—solution in a cell—must be essentially higher
than the energy of the ground level of oscillations in the units (electric dipoles) of a
biosystem (protein or genome). In this regime,
ni ≈

Eia −μ
(12.16)
and this approximation is good for the pumping level J exceeding some threshold
J0. Thus, for
J ≥J0,
(12.17)
n1 crucially dominates over the rest of n j. This is the phenomenon of Fröhlich
condensation.

Conditions for Fröhlich Condensation
We now list the conditions which combination leads to this phenomenon:
• D Discrete character of the energy exchange between a system, the heat bath, and
external energy source.
• BE Bose–Einstein statistics of the thermal equilibrium state of the heat reservoir.
• BV Big heat capacity of reservoir comparing with capacity of a bio-component.
• HT High temperature of the reservoir.
• ES High intensity of external energy supply.
Often condition BE is coupled with mystical features of quantum systems. How-
ever, in fact, it is based on heuristically very simple and natural condition of indis-
tinguishability [405]; see Chap. 18.
12.4
Quantum Formalism for Fröhlich Condensation
My interest for the Fröhlich condensation was stimulated by paper [440]. It was
written by the group of experts in quantum modeling of laser processes, and it is
readable only by such experts. The paper contains many technical details which are
not important for the majority of readers of this book. It is better to follow earlier
paper [470] which presentation is simpler and more useful for our further transition
to the quantum-like framework.
Consider biounits with discrete energy spectrum (12.3) or vibrations (12.2). To
each energy mode Eia, the creation and annihilation operators a⋆
i and ai are assigned.
These modes interact with the heat bath ﬁlled by the energy excitations with
spectrum (see (12.5)): E1b < · · · < Enb The corresponding creation and annihilation
operators are denoted by the symbols b⋆
i and bi.
The external energy supply has the energy spectrum
E1c < · · · < Enc,
(12.18)
which is associated with creation and annihilation operators denoted by the symbols
c⋆
i and ci.
Hamiltonian of compound system: dipole, its heat bath, and external ﬁeld of
energy pumping, is written in the terms of the creation and annihilation operators in
the standard way:
H = H0 + Hab1 + Hab2 + Hac.(14)
(12.19)
The operator H0 represents the free energies of the corresponding subsystems:

Later we use abbreviation ‘h.t.’ for ‘Hermitian conjugate’ and write other parts of
Hamiltonian in the form:

(12.23)
Here α and γ are the coefﬁcients for the interaction of dipole with the heat bath
and the external ﬂow of energy, respectively, leading to creation and annihilation of
single energy excitation in the dipole. The coefﬁcient β is the interaction constant
for the dipole-bath energy exchange leading to creation of one energy excitation in
the dipole and annihilation of another.
Higher order processes, i.e., creation of annihilation of two or more energy exci-
tations in the dipole at the same time are not considered. Such processes are not
typical for biosystems.
By using this Hamiltonian and the trace operation, one can write the dynamical
equation for the average number ni(t) of energy excitations for the dipole system. As
well as in the Fröhlich considerations, Wu and Austin [470] assume that the state of
the heat bath can be modeled as the thermal equilibrium state. The Planck expression
for the number of E-energy excitations is substituted into the dynamical equation
for ni(t). For stationary state w.r.t. the distribution of energy excitations in dipoles,
it is required that the average value of the change of the phonon number with any
energy be zero. This equation leads to Fröhlich’s expression (12.14).
To derive the existence of the supply threshold J0 for which the chemical potential
μ approaches E1a, Wu and Austin [470] referred to article [162].1
12.5
Cancer
Fröhlich [162] applied his theory to modeling of cancer initiation process in a tissue
or an organ of an organism. He described this process in biophysical terms:
The problem of cancer is one of the controls of cell division. While bacterial cells under
appropriate conditions keep on dividing, cells in a fully grown differentiated tissue or organ
divide relatively rarely, though they divide more rapidly in growing tissues and organs.
We shall assume that a controlling agency belonging to the whole organ, i.e., a collective

property, exists and that individual cells respond to it. …This then implies that a coherent
electric vibration carried collectively by the individual nuclei extends through the whole
tissue (organ), and that the vibrations of each individual cell respond to it and are thus held
in the appropriate phase, such that the total electric energy is a minimum. In general, this
vibrating polarization ﬁeld will form a complicated spacial pattern.
By Fröhlich this polarization ﬁeld controls the rate of cell’s division. Perturbation
of the ﬁeld destroys the control mechanism and leads to unregulated division of some
cells. This can become a self-stimulating process: increase in the number of cells
vibrating out of the common phase makes the polarization ﬁeld weaker and the latter
in turn leads to weaker control of coherence in cells’ behavior.
12.6
Condensation of Information
In a long series of works, see, e.g., [243, 247, 253] I have been working on the purely
informational model of biological social, and ﬁnancial processes. In this project, the
appeal to quantum information is crucial since the latter is about observational and not
objective features of systems. Here the previous studies are structured to formulate
the purely informational version of the Fröhlich condensation.
Information Excitations
Followingtheparadigmofinformationbiology(seeChap.4),weconsiderbiosystems
asinformationprocessors(I-systems).Theyabsorbandemitportionsofinformation.
Portions are discrete, otherwise it is difﬁcult to interpret and use them. So, we can
speak about information quanta or excitations. Each excitation has a few attributes
(A1, . . . , AN), as in physics photon (light excitation) has say energy A1, polarization
A2, and momentum A3. For simplicity, we mainly proceed with excitations carry-
ing single attribute A. So, we can speak about A-excitations. Their magnitude is
quantiﬁed with discrete spectrum. For example, A can be s-energy. By following the
quantum-like approach, we model Fröhlich condensation at all scales of physical,
biological, ecological, and social organization.
Information Formulation of Condensation Conditions
We consider a complex I-system S and its subsystems Sk. Similarly, to condition
D (Sect. 12.3), it is assumed that A-spectrum is discrete, see (12.3). In the previous
considerations, S was a cell, and its units were dipoles in some biomolecular, say
protein. Now a complex I-system S can be a human organ and its units are cells; for
example, the brain and neurons in it. The S can be an ecosystem and Sk be different
organisms living in it. In Chap. 11, S was a social group or just a virtual social system
based on a social network.
The complex I-system S is compound of units Sk and information reservoir E.
The latter is ﬁlled by a variety of I-excitations in the state of equilibrium with the
Bose–Einstein statistics given by the Planck formula—condition BE (Sect. 12.3).
Here the coefﬁcient λ gives the scale of exchange of A-excitations in a compound
system S. One can couple λ with a kind of temperature for ‘a gas of A-excitations’;

200
12
Stability in Biological, Ecological, and Social Systems via Fröhlich Condensation
see Sect. 12.6. We also assume that the information capacity of Sk is essentially less
than the capacity of E (condition BV).
The system S is exposed to supply of external information carrying A-excitations.
The model assumes discrete A-spectra both for the external information supply and
for the reservoir–condition D (Sect. 12.3). We consider I-systems exposed for infor-
mation supply of high intensity, condition ES.
Bose–Einstein Statistics of Information Excitations
What are the sufﬁcient conditions for Bose–Einstein statistics of information excita-
tions in the bath? Why did we transfer condition BE to the domain of information?
Here one can follow book [405] on the statistical mechanical derivation of the
classical and quantum statistics of the equilibrium states of the bath. In fact, the only
difference between systems leading to classical versus quantum statistics is their dis-
tinguishability versus indistinguishability (Chap. 18). And we recall that Schrödinger
treated the attributes assigned to systems in the Copenhagen like manner, i.e., as w.r.t.
observables. In article 267 this distinguishability versus indistinguishability reason-
ing was applied to information excitations (see Chap. 18). Thus, the BE-condition
can be transformed into the condition:
ID Indistinguishability.
We remark that indistinguishability is understood in the following way (Chap. 18):
Two I-excitations (quanta of information) having the same A-attributes are con-
sidered as indistinguishable.
So, it does not mean that two concrete communications C1 and C2 carrying
I-excitations coincide. They can essentially differ in their content. But, if the A-
attributes of these communications coincide, A(C1) = A(C2) then C1 and C2 are
indistinguishable, but only for this concrete information attribute A.
For example, let A be s-energy coupled to the war in Ukraine; A is quanti-
ﬁed as (12.18). If two communications (generated by mass-media) carry the same
amount of s-energy coupled to the war, A(C1) = Eic = A(C2), then C1 and C2 are
indistinguishable—in the context of the war in Ukraine.
We can consider a model with a few attributes of information A1, . . . , AN. If
Ak(C1) = Ak(C2), k = 1, 2 . . . N, then communications C1 and C2 are indistin-
guishable (w.r.t. these system of attributes).
By proceeding solely with ID, one derives (Chap. 18) all possible quantum statis-
tics, cf. [405]. In the Fröhlich I-context, the Fermi–Dirac statistics and parastatistics
seems to be improper. However, who does know? We cannot exclude the possibility
that, in biology, cognitive social sciences, such statistics also would be useful.
High Information Temperature
We recall that A-excitations are quantiﬁed with discrete spectrum (12.3). Condition
HT, see (12.15), can be rewritten as
λ >> E1a.
(12.24)

12.7 Information Temperature
201
The ground level of A-excitation E1a of components Sk of compound I-system S is
essentially less than the scale of exchange of A-quanta with information reservoir E in
the compound system S. This is the most delicate condition. A consistent introduction
of a kind of I-temperature (Sect. 12.7) would clarify it essentially.
Information Energy
For further considerations, it is convenient to assume that information excitations
carry a kind of energy representing potentiality to perform actions of the information
nature—information energy (I-energy).2 We will introduce different types of I-
energy, e.g., social, private, and behavioral I-energies. I-temperature (Sect. 12.7)
represents the intensity of I-energy exchange.
Redistribution of Information Excitations
Suppose that each I-excitation carries the A-attribute. For simplicity, we operate
with just one attribute, e.g., I-energy. I-processors have the A-spectrum (Eia), the
range of possible A-values, with associated creation and annihilation operators a⋆
i
and ai. The I-reservoir is characterized by its A-spectrum (Eib) with associated
operators b⋆
i and bi, and external information supply by spectrum (Eic) and operators
c⋆
i and ci. The description with the creation and annihilation operators is formal; it is
insensitive to the kind of excitations which generation and annihilation is described—
the energy excitations or other types. The corresponding Hamiltonians and the master
equation can be used (Sect. 12.4). The quantum-like model can also be considered
for I-excitations carrying multiple attributes A = (A1 . . . , AN); the corresponding
creation and annihilation operators will be labeled by multi-indexes.
12.7
Information Temperature
We introduce I-temperature thermodynamically by consideration of the state of
equilibrium for the information reservoir E. This is equilibrium for exchange by A-
excitations between E and subsystems emitting these excitations to E and absorbing
them from it. To make closer the analogy with physics, we select A = E as I-energy.
For the equilibrium state, the exchange parameter λ for the I-energy excitations
can be determined from the Planck formula (12.6):
λ =
Eib
ln(1 + 1/Nib).
(12.25)
For the equilibrium state, RHS of (12.6) does not depend on i. This feature can
serve as a test for approaching I-equilibrium. I-temperature (w.r.t. its ﬁxed attribute
2 For cognitive systems, information actions can (but generally do not need) generate actions in
physical space. So, information energy can be transferred into physical energy. For the moment,
we do not have a mathematical model of such transition. In turn, generation of information excita-
tions consumes physical energy; the following picture arises: …→physical energy→information
energy→physical energy→…

dimension/temperature”:
T =

(We stress that in physics selection k = K, where K is the Boltzmann constant is
also the subject for the agreement.) The Planck formula can be written as in physics:
Nib =

Eib

(12.27)
where k is an information analogue of the Boltzmann constant. By the agreement we
select it as independent from an information reservoir. (In principle, the parameter
k can depend on information reservoirs.) The I-version of the high temperature
condition HT has the form:
kT >> E1a.
(12.28)
Hence,E mustbehot(inthesenseoftheabovedeﬁnitionofinformationtemperature).
12.8
Stability of Complex Information Societies
We now apply the I-reformulation of Fröhlich condensation theory to model order
stability in complex social systems.
Social Energy and Atoms
Following Chap. 11, humans are considered as social analogues of atoms, s-atoms,
discrete elementary components of human society. We are interested only in I-
processing performed by s-atoms, so these are I-processors.
Consider one of the basic attributes of I-excitations—social energy (s-energy)
quantifying human’s potential to perform social actions (see Chap. 11). Generally,
actions are of the information nature, they are related to information exchange, e.g.,
decision-making, problem-solving, but some of them have the potential to be trans-
formed into actions in physical space. s-energy is the special form of I-energy; its
specialty is in the class of I-processors, humans.
It is supposed that s-energy spectrum of s-atom can be discretely quantiﬁed (see D
and (12.2)). This is how human cognition works. It calibrates the degree of excitement
carried by I-excitations. In the simplest scale, these are just two values, E1a and E2a :
weak and strong excitement. Generally, the scale is more complex, see (12.2).
External supply of s-energy is composed of I-excitations which are generated by
a variety of information sources, mainly mass-media. Each communication, news,
comment, article, video, carries a discrete portion of s-energy. The quantiﬁcation
of s-energy depends on an individual; in complete agreement with the Copenhagen
ideology s-energy is not the objective property of a communication. Its concrete

value is assigned by observers and humans. In principle, people can assign, often
unconsciously,differentvaluesofs-energytothesamecommunication,saynews.For
social lasing as well as for Fröhlich condensation, homogeneity of a social group is
important. In laser physics, impurities in atom population—active medium—disturb
generation of the coherent laser pulses. Coherent condensation of DNA-vibrations
in all cells in the concrete organ is due to homogeneity of spectra of dipole vibrations
in all DNA-molecules. The latter, in turn, is due to the speciﬁc geometry of DNA-
molecules in this organ.
Social Conditions for Condensate
• BE (Bose–Einstein statistics for excitations in social reservoir; Chap. 18): This is
a consequence of indistinguishability condition ID. Of course, information stored
in reservoir E is not totally contentless. But up to some degree, it can be character-
ized by just one observable—s-energy (single attribute of I-excitations, A = E).
s-atoms are attracted by the degree of excitement (s-energy) carried by communi-
cation: comment, post, news, article. The model can be generalized by completing
the s-energy with additional attributes B, C, D, . . . (quasicolors in theory of social
lasing)3 of I-excitations. Indistinguishability up to s-energy and these attributes
also leads to the Planck formula .
• BV (Large social reservoir): The s-energy reservoir E is one of the basic compo-
nents of the compound socio-informational system S. The informational environ-
ment of modern humans includes the variety of internet platforms as YOUTUBE,
Live Journal, Facebook, Telegram, Twitter, and so on. They present the big col-
lection of videos, articles, photos, posts, comments, comments on comments. It is
natural to assume that in terms of the s-energy capacity E is very large comparing
with s-atom.
• HT (High social temperature regime): Social temperature T can be introduced
in the general information framework (see Sect. 12.7). But, as in physics, this
thermodynamical introduction via consideration of the state of information equi-
librium can be completed by the operational approach, by considering so to say
social thermometers and calibration procedures for them. In principle, one can
proceed without appealing to social temperature, by operating with λ as model’s
parameter, characterizing the scale of s-energy exchange in a society; see (12.24).
• ES (High intensity of social supply): In the modern society, information supply has
very high intensity, mass-media, and social networks pump huge ﬂows of informa-
tion carrying huge social energy. Moreover, these information ﬂows are densely
populated by highly energetic news: wars, pandemics, terror-attacks, scandals. It
should be stressed that people are overloaded by variety of information coming
from TV, newspapers, and various gadgets. This leads to contentless information
processing, up to s-energy and some additional attributes. People do not have the
computational and time resources for detailed cognitive analysis of information
(clip thinking, popcorn brain, . . .).
3 In this theory, s-energy plays the special role. Therefore it is useful to separate it from the rest of
attributes.

204
12
Stability in Biological, Ecological, and Social Systems via Fröhlich Condensation
The basis of the Fröhlich social condensation process is s-energy redistribution
between possible levels of s-energy of s-atoms. Fröhlich condensation for social
excitations leads to a stable society which is characterized by the homogeneous
structure of the s-energy distribution.
Open Information Societies as Social Fröhlich Condensate
In contrast to the authoritarian societies, open democracies like USA, EU-countries,
Canada, Australia, and so on preserve order stability practically without censor-
ship and restriction of information production and its ﬂows. Moreover, despite the
powerful information ﬂows of all kinds, the open societies are characterized by con-
centration of the most population on the approximately the same mode of s-energy. In
particular, the slice of hyperactive people those who can disturb societal order is not
so wide. Such people quickly “radiate” their energy. Where does it go? Its essential
part is absorbed by the reservoir of social energy E. These highly charged guys emit
a part of their energy into social networks, by posting comments, photos, videos,
clips, articles at say Live-journal and responding to posts of others. Nowadays the
main part of energy exchange between people goes through E. So, creation of the
huge information (s-energy) reservoir is one of the basic conditions of social stability
of open societies. Another basic condition is continuous pumping of s-energy via
very powerful information ﬂows. Stability is possible if s-energy supply overcomes
some threshold. Social temperature (Sect. 12.7) has to be sufﬁciently high (so hot
and shock news are really the necessary element of the stabilization structure).
Fröhlich condensation has not only stabilization function, but it is also the pow-
erful mechanism of societal energy accumulation on the basic active mode. Most
members of such society are in the state of sufﬁciently high energy, so they are
functionally active. The latter is also the important function of the social Fröhlich
condensate.
In contrast to the Fröhlich condensate model for the open information societies,
the authoritarian societies can be quantum-like modeled with the Bose–Einstein
condensate. However, the latter model is not so exciting, since approaching order
stability via a kind of social freezing can be expected from the very beginning.
12.9
Order in Pack of Wolfs
Consider a pack of wolfs, it reminds a macromolecule; wolfs are analogues of dipoles
(or s-atoms in the model of the social condensate). As well as dipoles in a macro-
molecule, or humans in a social group, wolfs in a pack are coupled via nonlinear
interactions and behavioral interactions. The nature and structure of these interac-
tions is complex, and their mathematical formalization is difﬁcult, if possible, at all.
Their main impact is generation of order stability in a wolf pack and approaching
the stable level of sufﬁciently high behavioral activity. The latter will be expressed
in terms of behavioral energy. The wolfs in a pack behave coherently. And we want
to model this behavior with Fröhlich’s theory. The latter is simple mathematically,

12.9 Order in Pack of Wolfs
205
one does not need to go deeply into the description of the individual behavioral inter-
actions; statistical considerations lead to clearly formulated conditions of coherent
behavior of the wolfs in a pack.
Natural Information Reservoir
Wolfs live in the natural environment E which reminds the heat bath in a cell or
the reservoir of s-energy in human society; E includes forest, animals living in it,
and natural (e.g., weather) conditions. This environment is treated as an information
environment. Hence, e.g., animals are considered not as physical bodies, but as I-
processors: the sources and receivers of information signals, visual, audio, smell.
This is the ocean of information and wolfs interact with it. They absorb information
from E and emit their own signals (e.g., wolf’s howl and smell) into E.
Exchange of Behavioral Energy
We are interested in the special sort of I-energy (the attribute of information)—
behavioral energy (b-energy). b-energy is expressed as potentiality to a variety of
behavioral actions inside a wolf pack as well as with the components of E. So,
wolfs are considered as discrete systems (so to say behavioral atoms) emitting and
absorbing b-energy. The latter is like s-energy of humans. However, it is more natural
to speak about animals’ behavior and not socialization.
Inside the pack, wolfs exchange B-excitations, either straightforwardly, as strug-
gle for does, for the place in pack’s hierarchy, or through more complicated chains
of b-energy transitions. For example, in hunting the most energetic wolfs, the beater
wolfs, spend essential part of their b-energy resources to catch a deer. But, then the
meat is distributed through the whole wolf pack and those which, before hunting,
were in low B-state transit to higher energy state. This transition is based on the
physical energy contained in meet, chemical energy collected in organic molecules.
Behavioral and Physical Energies
Now we come to the complicated issue of interrelation of the physical and infor-
mation energies. (We already had similar discussion for s-energy.) The process of
transition of the physical energy into the psychic energy has been discussed a lot
in psychology, cognition, behavioral, and social studies. However, in spite of the
tremendous efforts, the notion of psychical, mental, or social energy as the objective
property of say a human being was not ﬁrmly established. We deﬁned information
energy as measurable quantity, as an observable over information processors. In this
approach, the physical energy can be treated as a kind of hidden variable behind the
information energy.
In quantum theory, the hidden variables conjecture has been intensively discussed:
hidden variables can be found behind observable quantities. Such hidden variables
can be determined in the classical manner, as objectively assigned to systems. The
common consensus, based on the interpretation of violations of the Bell inequalities,
is that hidden variables cannot be introduced straightforwardly, as context indepen-
dent quantities. However, the context-dependent hidden variables can naturally be
invented. And biosystem’s behavior is fundamentally contextual. In this framework,
coupling of the physical and behavioral energies is contextual, i.e., it depends on

206
12
Stability in Biological, Ecological, and Social Systems via Fröhlich Condensation
context. It means that depending on context an animal can get different amounts of
b-energy from the same amount of food. Bio-contexts are very complex. And it is
practically impossible to describe them mathematically, in such a detail that it would
be possible to model the process of transformation of calories into b-energy. How-
ever, as was pointed out, in this book we do not try to model the transfer between
the physical and behavioral energies.
External Supply of Behavioral Energy
Let us turn to the original Fröhlich model. External energy supply comes to a cell
in the form of electromagnetic and chemical energies: photons and ions arriving
into a cell from outside. A cell by itself is the environment for macromolecules,
e.g., proteins. A molecule absorbs quantum of external energy and then it is redis-
tributed inside this molecule. Redistribution is performed via transfer of vibration
quanta—phonons. Fröhlich pointed out that the energy forms involved in the process
of coherent condensation are not important.
The crucial role is assigned to interrelation between the energy scales of external
supply, vibrations of dipoles, and the heat bath. They are hierarchically ordered, from
highly energetic external quanta to less energetic internal vibrations, and, ﬁnally, to
the heat bath excitations having lower magnitudes.
And coming back to wolf’s behavior, we can relate to external supply B-
excitations which have higher magnitudes than b-energy redistribution in a pack.
The latter in turn have higher magnitudes than reservoir’s B-excitations. Such highly
energetic B-supply includes arrival to E of animals or humans which serve for wolfs
asnewhigh B-excitations,intheformofnutritionanddanger.Italsoincludesextreme
changes of weather conditions as well as forest ﬁre.
Conditions for Behavioral Fröhlich Condensate
We now go through conditions for generation of the Fröhlich condensate (Sect. 12.3).
• BE (Bose–Einstein statistics for excitations in the environmental I-reservoir;
Chap. 18): This condition is a consequence of indistinguishability behavioral exci-
tations. Of course, such excitations are not completely indistinguishable. Besides
b-energy, they carry some attributes, e.g., sounds, smells, etc. And animals react
not only to the b-energy magnitude, but also to the magnitudes of other attributes.
Each attribute contributes to animal’s behavior. For simplicity, in the model under
consideration I-excitations are distinguished only w.r.t. the B—energy magnitude.
• BV (Large information environment): I-capacity of the environmental reservoir
E must be essentially bigger than single wolf’s I-capacity. This is really the case
if a wolf lives in the natural environment and not in a cell in Zoo; cf. [349, 402]
and Sect. 12.9.
• HT (High temperature regime): Behavioral temperature of the environment must
be sufﬁciently high, so exchange of behavioral excitations in E should have the
high degree of activity. This happens only in the environment populated by actively
interacting animals or (and) with varying natural conditions. If one does not want
to appeal to a behavioral analogue of temperature, then it is possible to operate
with the parameter λ quantifying the scale of energy exchange.

12.9 Order in Pack of Wolfs
207
• ES (High intensity of external energy supply): In the framework of alpha-wolfs
theory this condition is a consequence of active behavioral regulation driven in
a pack by alpha-male and female. In some sense, this is the straightforward way
to approach order stability. The case of self-regulation without strict and violent
control from the side of alpha-wolfs is more interesting from the viewpoint of
theory of Fröhlich condensation. Here coherent behavior of wolfs is conditioned
by active external behavioral stimulation.
Hence, the wolf’s pack would behave as the Fröhlich behavioral condensate in the
forest or another environment E which is sufﬁciently densely populated by actively
interacting animals (BV, HT) and with sufﬁciently intensive external supply (ES)
of newly arriving to E animals, humans, and variability of external, for example,
weather conditions. In other words, order stability in a wolf’s pack is approached via
redistribution of b-energy from highly behaviorally active wolfs to less active pack’s
members in the environment E with the aforementioned properties.
The same model can be used for the herds of other animals, say elephants. Savanna
which is densely populated by behaviorally active animals is the good example of
the environment generating behavioral order in animals’ herds. Savanna is charac-
terized by high behavioral temperature and intensive supply of behavioral energy,
in particular, via transformation of physical energy of nutrition. This is high-energy
stability, savanna’s Fröhlich condensate.
Packs Controlled by Alpha-Wolfs
Up to now, we did not consider the role of alpha-wolfs, males and females, in creation
of behavioral stability in a wolf pack. Although highlighting the alpha-wolfs role is
common in research on wolf’s behavior, in the light of the recent studies one should
take this concept with caution.
The concept goes back to the article written by animal behaviorist Schenkel [402]
and it spread widely in research on wolf’s collective behavior. However, recently the
concept of a wolf pack rigid alpha-control was criticized starting with Mech [349].
Schenkel’s picture of a supreme pack leader who dominates through permanent ﬁght
and reigns superior to the other wolves in his pack corresponds to artiﬁcially created
packs in Zoo which he used for his studies, but the naturally created packs of wild
wolfs are primarily based on family relations and the alpha-dominance is not at all
the main source of order stability in a pack (Mech, 1999). A pack which is ruled
by alpha-wolfs is an animal analogue of the authoritarian society. Order stability is
such a pack, based on brutal control from the alpha-wolfs side. As was pointed out,
such packs were formed in ZOOs. We note that in such a situation creation of the
behavioral Fröhlich condensate is in principle impossible, because conditions listed
in Sect. 12.9 are violated: capacity of the I-reservoir is very low (cf. BV), external
I-supply is neither intensive (cf. BS), new I-excitations are so rare that they cannot

Stability in Biological, Ecological, and Social Systems via Fröhlich Condensation
12.10
Concluding Remarks on Physical and Social Fröhlich
Condensation
In this chapter, we reviewed the Fröhlich condensate theory without going deeply
into technical details. We hope that this presentation will be useful for experts in
biosystems, cognition, psychology, decision-making, behavioral and social sciences.
Physicists who are interested in aforementioned applications can also earn something
from this review, since, in contrast to the Bose–Einstein condensation, the Fröhlich
condensation was not highly advertised in physics. We presented two approaches:
• Nonequilibrium thermodynamics.
• Formalism of open quantum systems.
Although the quantum approach is relatively formally simple and rather rigor-
ous, the thermodynamical approach which was originally suggested by Fröhlich
should not be neglected, because it provides the clear heuristic picture of statistical
processes. The quantum picture is given in terms of creation and annihilation oper-
ators, Hamiltonian dynamics of the compound system, a system + its environment
(reservoir). These leads via averaging w.r.t. the environment degrees of freedom to
a quantum master equation, and analysis of conditions leading to approaching a far
from equilibrium steady state. The thermodynamical approach emphasizes the role
of the equilibrium state of the reservoir and its high temperature. Both approaches
highlight the role of high intensity of external energy supply.
As an illustrative example, we brieﬂy present the Fröhlich model of cancer’s
initiation as resulting from the coherent vibrations of the dipoles in cell’s macro-
molecules destruction of DNA and proteins. The coherent vibrations condensate can
be destroyed by resonant microwave radiation; condensate’s perturbation leads to
uncontrollable cells’ division.
In this book, the conditions sufﬁcient for creation of the coherent condensate far
from equilibrium were reformulated without straightforward coupling to the physical
energy notion. These conditions match the information approach to biology, physics,
behavioralandsocialsciences.Startingwiththeseconditions,wepresentedthemodel
of the Fröhlich-like information condensate with invention of the information energy
notion. As its special forms, we consider the social and behavioral energies.
In the terms of the s-energy exchange between s-atoms, representing humans, and
the large information reservoir, of Internet-based social networks and information
exchange platforms, we formulated conditions for far from equilibrium order stability
in the modern open society—democracies of USA, EU, Canada, Australia, Japan,
South Korea….
The model emphasizes that the external supply of s-energy has to be high enough,
higher than so to say the stability threshold. This supply is based on the information
excitations ﬂow generated by a variety of information sources, mainly, mass-media.
The social Fröhlich condensate model spotlights the role of powerful information
supply generation for order stability in the modern open society. Essential decrease in
the information stream would lead to social decoherence and might be even to soci-

ety’s collapse. As in the biosystems, in the social systems Fröhlich-like condensation
serves not only for preservation of order stability, but also for s-energy redistribution.
Highly energetic members of society redistribute their energy to weakly energetic
ones. The latter does not fall to the state of equilibrium with I-reservoir, so they are
in the sustainable state corresponding to the minimal energy characteristic for the
modern open societies.
Mathematically the model is based on the quantum formalism for creation and
annihilation operators for social excitations and the quantum master equation, which
leads to a stationary state under the aforementioned constraints for exchange by
quanta of s-energy.
In Sect. 12.9, similarly of societal stability in a far from equilibrium state, we
model coherent collective behavior of animals with the illustrative example of a wolf
pack. In this framework, it is natural to operate with the notion of the behavioral
energy and its excitations. The exchange of such excitations between wolfs and with
surrounding information environment (I-reservoir) is mathematically modeled with
the operators of creation and annihilation and the quantum master equation. The
‘wolf’s Fröhlich condensate’ can exist only in a rich information-environment and
a wolf pack has to be exposed to intensive supply of external information carrying
novel behavioral excitations.
We hope that this book as well as the recent articles [305, 306] would attract
attention of biologists, psychologists, and social and behavioral studies experts to
the Fröhlich condensate model for order stability preservation via distribution of
social and behavioral energies and coherent behavior. We conclude this chapter with
the statement of F. Fröhlich (the son of H. Fröhlich) presented in [156] (see also
[446]):
If one thinks without preconceptions of collective phenomena in which the behaviour of
discrete constitutive individuals is modiﬁed, and constituting a large collective group where
the whole is more than and different from a simple addition of its parts, living organisms
would indeed seem to be the ideal example.

Social Networks: Laser Physics, Phase Transition,
and Critical Phenomena
This chapter extends the social laser theory presented in Chap. 11; this extension is
due to the paper of Alodjants, Bazhenov, Khrennikov, and Bukhanovsky [12].
We emphasize that the current life-style may be characterized as a sequence of on-
line representations in various networks. The rapid growth of information (network)
resources in terms of information exchange and processing leads to an exponential
growth in the information being processed. Sometimes, enormous (social) enhance-
ment effect can result from unimportant, at ﬁrst sight, information spread. Contrary,
in some cases, socially actual information and knowledge rapidly attenuate.
• How fast does socially actual (social) information spread in social networks and
communities?
• How are these communities transformed under some perturbations?
These questions are becoming critical for a well-functioning society.
To ﬁnd answers to these questions, we suggest to use the novel paradigm of
social laser. As was stressed in this chapter, the social laser model can be explored
to describe real-life socially actual information processing and reinforcement in the
presence of strong mass media action, which is determined as a mass media pump.
Understanding the physics of laser generation and coherence has always been
a key task for laser physics. Main (coherent) statistical features of laser irradiation
were explained within quantum and nonlinear optics theory [15, 176, 183, 392, 399].
Another theory of phase transitions and critical phenomena based on statistical and
thermodynamic approach was able to explain coherent phase ordering in condensed
matter [99], and macroscopic coherent effects of superconductivity [337]. The rela-
tionship between these two theories has always been the subject of heated debates
that beneﬁcially affected laser science as a whole. The main difference between
the two fundamental theoretical approaches is that initially phase transitions were

considered only for thermodynamic equilibrium systems [337]. However, laser sys-
tems are not thermodynamically equilibrium (cf. with Fröhlich condensation).
To proceed to social applications, we shall not go deeply into interrelation of
laser physics with phase transition and critical phenomena theories. We restrict our
consideration to the discussion about some analogies occurring in open (driven—
dissipative) and thermodynamically equilibrium laser-like systems exhibiting phase
transitions [119, 178, 227].
The thermodynamic approach is widely applied for condensed or solid state sys-
tems, which are ordered in a certain way, or not ordered at all, like gases. The study
of phase transitions in complex structured systems has recently been of great interest
[68, 126, 373]. Although systems, such as spin glasses, have been studied for a long
time, these are various complex networks, including the social networks, that are in
the focus now [372].
The main reason for the growing interest in such systems is the large-scale Internet
network development and global digitalization of the human society, which cover all
aspects of humans life [403]. Providing subscribers with an opportunity to socialize
globally, the Internet itself has become a social phenomenon that unites people in var-
ious social communities and on business and educational platforms (as well as con-
tribute to social clustering and polarization). By examining phase transitions in such
networks, we are able to make some conclusions (within certain limits) about social,
information, communication, and emotional processes occurring in cyberspace [45,
205, 362]. In particular, public (social) networks promote a coherent macroscopic
social impact involving a large number of people online. They provide information
ampliﬁcation and cascading, which may be elucidated by computer-mediated social
studies [102]. In real life, coherent processes occurring in the networks provide social
cohesion, which in some cases leads to cascading social processes (Arab spring,
Orange and Maindan revolutions in Ukraine, Occupy Wall Street movements, mass
protests against Lucashenko in Belarus, vaccination vs. anti-vaccination campaigns,
etc.) in different countries [198, 321, 345].
One of intriguing problems at the nexus of modern quantum physics and statistical
physics, social sciences, cognitive and computer-oriented studies is how close various
statistical (laser-like) physical models may describe “online” social events occurring
due to current Internet communication facilities. From physical point of view, the
coherent processes discussed are similar to laser ﬁeld generation, which results in
huge energy release in ensemble of two- (or multi-) level oscillators under population
inversion conditions.
Notably, current studies of processes occurring in social communities are based
on fundamentals of statistical physics and phase transitions theory. Traditionally, the
approach of statistical physics is applied to complex systems description, which can
include various social networks exhibiting social communities, cf. [374]. In particu-
lar, statistical Ising model is at the basis of many socially oriented statistical models,
which are related to the exchange of information between people [126, 332, 420,
422, 457]. A simpliﬁed two-level (spin-like) decision-making (DM) agents model
may be used in this case [171]; DM agents can be treated as s-atoms (Chap. 11). In
particular, Ising-like models suppose collective opinion formation and social impact

[204, 319], epidemic, information, and rumor spreading [351, 363, 375]. However,
the major part of the models examined is thermodynamically equilibrium, whereas
real-life social processes require a non-equilibrium approach. In this sense, the prob-
lem of non-equilibrium phase transition is of primary interest, as it may appear in
laser-like systems possessing Ising-like Hamiltonians, cf. [57, 227]. Such models
become crucial for feature modeling of distributed intelligence systems, which pre-
sume artiﬁcial and natural intelligence agents of DM behavior and their interaction
capacity in the framework of a socially oriented network [181].
In this chapter, we extend the social laser theory by establishing a simple (generic)
model of a social laser as a system possessing the second-order (non-equilibrium)
phase transition, which presumes a complex network topology inherent to real net-
work social communities. To be more speciﬁc, we examine networks, which may be
characterized by means of power-law degree distribution function. Such networks
allow for a relative simple analytical description [45]. Here it is the good place to
mention the quantum ﬁeld approach to modeling of cognition and consciousness
(Vitiello [447, 448]) explaining the long range correlations in the brain.
We start with the brief description of a socially oriented Ising model, which
exhibits the second-order ferromagnetic (ordering state)—paramagnetic (disorder-
ing state) phase transition at equilibrium. Then we proceed to social laser mean ﬁeld
theory relevant to the interaction of two-level DM agents (s-atoms) with classical
(pump) and quantum-like information ﬁelds. At the heart of these models there are
basic statistical properties of complex networks, which create the link between the
non-equilibrium social laser paradigm and existing socially oriented Ising-type mod-
els. To be more speciﬁc, we examine networks with power-law degree distribution
which possess relatively simple analytical treatments for key parameters inherent to
the models established in this work, cf. [441]. Finally, the social laser non-equilibrium
behavior is examined. Social lasing phenomena are represented as an information
cascade process, which relates to the application of the SIS (susceptible-infected-
susceptible) model for characterizing information spread in social networks.

Ising-Type Interaction ín Networks
We start with the Ising model deﬁned on annealed networks. We assume that two-
level (spin-1/2) quantum systems randomly occupy N nodes of a complex network—
see Fig. 13.1. In the framework of social community analysis we model decision-
making agents with these simple quantum systems and assume that they possess
information exchange action. Thus, we represent this community as a graph with
nontrivial (speciﬁc) properties. The Ising Hamiltonian of the model reads as

ponent.
The ﬁrst term in (13.1) characterizes interaction between DM agents. In real life
such an interaction is implemented by some information exchange, which is still
hidden for an external “observer” within the Ising model. Notably, for this model we
cannot predict directly how information is relevant to DM agents inhomogeneously
distributed over the network. However, we can conclude how this information spreads
within the network because of the ﬁrst term in (13.1), which depends on the network
topology. The sum in (13.1) is performed over the graph vertices with certain adja-
cency matrix Ai j proportional to Ji j, which stores the information about the graph
structure: matrix element Ai j = 1 if two vertices are linked and Ai j = 0 otherwise.
Parameter hi in (13.1) characterizes the coupling of a DM agent with external
(information) ﬁeld. We examine the case when this information is the same for all
DM agents and represents classical (strong) information pumping. In other words, we
set hi = h for arbitrary i (hereafter for simplicity we put the Planck and Boltzmann
constants ℏ= 1, kB = 1).
We are interested in the annealed network approach that presumes a weighted,
fully connected graph model. The network dynamically rewires. We recast parameter
Ji j that indicates the coupling between the nodes in Eq. (13.1) through probability
pi j as Ji j = Jpi j, where J is a constant, and pi j is the probability for two nodes i
and j to be connected:
pi j = P(Ai j = 1) = kik j
N⟨k⟩,
(13.2)
where Ai j is an element of the adjacency matrix, ki is i-th node degree, which
indicates an expected number of the node neighbors and is taken from distribution
p(k). In (13.2), the quantity

is an average degree. Noteworthy, the annealed network approach is valid for pi j ≪1
and large enough N, cf. [45]. Thus, the strength of two spins interaction Ji j is a
variable parameter and depends on particular network characteristics; it is greater
for two pairs of nodes with the highest k coefﬁcient.
In practice, different approaches provide an explanation for a real-world network
topology [126]. Such networks may exhibit the power-law degree distribution. Since
the number of nodes is large enough, N ≫1, we are interested in network structures,
which admit continuous degree distribution p(k). To be more speciﬁc, in this work
we examine networks with distribution function p(k) deﬁned as
p(k) = (γ −1)kγ −1

where γ is a degree exponent that covers anomalous (1 < γ < 2)—Fig. 13.1a, scale-

The properties of scale-free networks possessing distribution (13.3) for γ = 2 and
γ = 3 should be calculated separately.
The normalization condition for p(k) is represented as

distribution function. The number of hubs and their size dramatically grow with
vanishing γ in the anomalous regime where kmax/kmin > N, cf. Fig. 13.1a and the
green line in Fig. 13.1d.

Social Laser and Networks Within Mean Field Theory
Real-world networks mostly possess degree exponent γ > 2. The Bianconi-
Barabási (BB) network appropriately models such a network. In particular, the BB
network is based on a ﬁtness model, which accounts that the probability of the
newly attached node link is proportional to its ﬁtness parameter [45]. This parame-
ter may be interpreted in the framework of statistical mechanics approach and leads
to γ = 2.255, [68]. In particular, it is possible to map the BB network to gas parti-
cles assuming that energy of each node is determined by its ﬁtness parameter. As a
result, we can clearly distinguish the new BEC phase of the network. The network
condensation phenomena presumes super-hub formation, which accumulates a huge
number of links; strictly speaking, such a network is not a scale-free any more.
The statistical properties of networks may be characterized by means of the n-th

On the contrary, their combination ζ ≡[K (1)]2K (4)/[K (2)]3 remains ﬁnite.

13.2.2
Phase Transition and Network’s Structure
Here, we use the Hamiltonian formalism, which is common in physics and widely
used in the framework of DM agents interaction, see, e.g., [126, 204, 319, 420,
422]. It allows to speak about some social energy stored in (13.1). In this sense, the
interpretation of social spin is straightforward: different spin components correspond
to agents preferences with the same spin energy. For example, with no external
information in elections people as DM agents can prefer to vote a candidate or
reject them without any social energy changing. The external (information) ﬁeld or
interaction with other agents inﬂuences our potential decisions. External information
may be enough to ﬂip our decision or not. In this case, the temperature, T , represents
some vital macroscopic parameter, which manifests about microscopic processes
occurring in the system .
In physics temperature indicates energy exchange for the canonical ensemble of
ﬁxed number of particles with the thermal bath. In social science, it is also possible
to introduce social temperature; it stands for some sophisticated (ﬁtting) parameter,
whichmaybediscussedintheframeworkofvariousmodelsineconomy,ﬁnance,etc.,
cf. [100, 128, 357]. In this work, we assume that social temperature indicates abilities
of DM agents for information exchange with other agents and with an environment,
respectively. In other words, thermalization, which is a keystone problem for any
physical system, may be achieved in social networks through information exchange.
In this case, the system approaches thermal equilibrium at time periods long enough.

In this work, we consider the mean-ﬁeld approach to the system described by the

by the order parameter Sz deﬁned as

At high enough temperatures and external ﬁeld h = 0 Eq. (13.10) admits nonzero
solution for collective spin component Sz. This solution corresponds to some ferro-
magnetic (FM) phase possessing Sz ̸= 0 and indicating some certain DM at macro-
scopic level. Critical reciprocal temperature βc, which provides this solution, is deter-
mined from Eq. (13.10) and represented as
βc =

(13.11)
where parameter ζ2 deﬁned in Eq. (13.8).
The dependence given in (13.11) admits simple interpretation in the framework of
information exchange. In particular, the strongest interaction between the DM agents
evokes the highest critical temperature, Tc ≡1/βc. Simultaneously, a large number
of hubs can manifest the activity of DM agents. In this limit, ζ2 is also large enough
and corresponds to high temperature of phase transition Tc. Critical temperature Tc
becomes very large (βc ≃0) in the vicinity of γ = 1 where ζ2 enormously increases,
see Fig. 13.2a. In the opposite case, for large degree exponent γ the ζ2 approaches
kmin and critical temperature becomes Tc ∝kmin.
Remarkably, similar arguments are still true in the mean-ﬁeld approximation if
we neglect degree correlations in the network and suppose in (13.11) ζ2 ≃⟨k⟩, which
leads to
Tc ≃2J⟨k⟩.
(13.12)
Equations (13.11) and (13.12) play a crucial role in phase transition occurring in
the ﬁnite size Ising model. The equations establish a clear connection between the
system temperature and network statistical properties. For a given temperature, T ,
the critical value, ζ2,c, is determined from (13.11) as
ζ2,c = T

The properties of parameter ζ may be inferred from Fig. 13.2a. The magnitude
of ζ is ﬁnite at γ = 1 and reaches its maximum value at γmax ≃1
2[ln(N) + 2 −
√ln(N)[ln(N) −4]], which implies γmax ≈2.21 for the networks with N = 1000
nodes established in Figs.13.1 and 13.2a, respectively.
Equation (13.16) establishes the second-order phase transition from paramagnetic
(PM) state (Sz = 0) to ferromagnetic (FM) one (Sz ̸= 0), which occurs if normalized
degreecorrelationfunctionobeystheζ2 ≥ζ2,c condition.Forsocialnetworksystems,
such a phase transition means transformation from disorder to some ordering state
with opinion formation or voting. Hence, phase transition for the analyzed Ising
model appears only due to ﬁnite size effects, cf. [126, 332, 422, 457].
Remarkably, for power-law degree distribution networks parameter ζ2 is the func-
tion of number of nodes N. The dependence of ζ2 versus N for various γ is shown in
Fig. 13.2b. As clearly seen, ζ2 grows signiﬁcantly within the anomalous domain of
γ . Therefore, social networks, which possess a growing number of hubs (decreasing
γ ), promote the occurrence of some ordering state; it may be characterized in terms
of deﬁnite social polarization, which is discussed in more detail below.

Non-equilibrium Phase Transition in Social Laser

Primary Consideration
In this section, we examine the social lasing effect as a non-equilibrium phase tran-
sition that occur in social systems possessing some speciﬁc features. The model we
discuss in this work may be formulated in a general form in terms of the quantum
ﬁeld theory apparatus.
For simplicity we consider N two-level systems (TLS), which comprise gain laser
medium;eachsystemisinherenttoawell-distinguishedground(|g⟩)andexcited(|e⟩)

220

states possessing different energies Eg and Ee, (Ee > Eg), respectively. We describe
TLS at states |e⟩and |g⟩by bosonic annihilation and creation operators, ˆa j and ˆa†
j for
ground state and ˆb j and ˆb†
j for excited state, respectively. We characterize the jth TLS
by resonant frequency (energy) of transition ω j = Ee, j −Eg, j ( j = 1, 2, . . . , N);
note that we use units where the Plank constant equal to 1.
We assume that interaction of TLSs ensemble with irradiation occurs in the res-
onator, which supports a multimode regime described by an annihilation (creation)
ﬁeld operator ˆfv, ( ˆfv
†), which freely evolves in time with common frequency ω, see
Fig. 13.3a, cf. [421]. Within the framework of dipole and rotating-wave approxima-
tions, the generic Hamiltonian of the system is given by:

(13.18)
where g j characterizes interaction strength (energy) of TLS with ﬁeld ˆfv. Thereafter,
we assume that gi = g for all TLS. In (13.18) k j is the jth node degree, which can
be understood as a mean number of modes occurring in a physical laser resonator.
Physically, 2g represents so-called vacuum Rabi-splitting frequency, which indi-
cates the rate, at which one quantum excitation may appear due to the interaction with
a resonator ﬁeld, cf. [313]. From quantum theory it is known that even in the absence
of photons in a resonator (so-called vacuum state) the resonant probability of TLS
transition from the ground state to the excited one within time t is W = sin2[gt], cf.
[409]. Considering short time intervals such as gt << 1 we can obtain W ≃g2t2.
Thereby, resonant excitation probability W of TLS is proportional to g2.
In (13.18) P is an external strong classical ﬁeld, which drives the gain medium. In
physical laser the pump ﬁeld is introduced into the resonator with the same frequency,
ω, which is inherent to a laser mode, see Fig. 13.3a.

Fig. 13.3 Sketch of a—physical and b—social laser systems, respectively. The processes, which
are allowed in the social laser for TLS representing agent of DM, are shown in (c). The model of
physical laser presumes interaction of resonator modes (only one mode is shown) with the ensemble
of two-level oscillators (atoms) in the presence of an optical pump. At the core of social laser there
is an echo chamber, which provides circulation and ampliﬁcation of some privileged mode for the
s-information ﬁeld in a social network (illustrated with the red directed edges) in the presence of
a strong social mass media pump. In c |g⟩and |e⟩are (emotionally) ground (neutral) and excited

j ˆa j deﬁne the jth TLS polarization (excitation)
and levels population imbalance (inversion) operators, respectively; ˆSzj,0 is a constant
operator. For TLS, which establishes a DM agent features these operators may be
recognized in the framework of quantum approach to DM theory, cf. [22, 38].
In Eq. (13.19), we describe the quantum model of driven-dissipative laser system
in its general form; ˆFph, ˆF1,2 are standard Langevin quantum noise operators, which
characterize laser medium coupling with the environment, cf. [325].
The non-equilibrium features of the model given in Eq. (13.19) are characterized
by parameters κ,  j and τ j. Physical lasers possess Fabry-Pérot (or some other)
resonators,whichinpracticeplayacrucialroleinformationandampliﬁcationoflaser
irradiation [421]. The medium, which possess some decay from resonator modes,
is placed in the resonator Fig. 13.3a. The atoms composing the medium can absorb
and emit near-resonant photons, which carry out some information. Without using
a resonator, photons may be absorbed or lost after several acts of absorption and
re-emission. With a resonator, laser ﬁeld is reﬂected many times and gained before
leaving the resonator. The losses of laser irradiation may appear, for example, due to
non-ideal resonator mirrors. The resonator Q (quality)-factor for a given laser mode
in this situation is determined by photon lifetime τph ∝1/κ in this mode, where κ
characterizes photon loss rate from the resonator [421]. Vanishing κ corresponds to

222
13

high Q-factor resonators, which prevent the leakage of laser ﬁeld photons from the
resonator. Roughly speaking, different resonator modes possess different values of κ.
We neglect these differences in our model. We account non-equilibrium features of
TLS in (13.19) by TLS depolarization (dephasing) rate  j and spontaneous emission
characteristic time τ j, respectively.
Throughout this work, we restrict ourselves by mean-ﬁeld theory. In this case, we
replace the operators in (13.19) by their mean values setting p j(t) = ⟨ˆp j⟩, E(t) =
⟨ˆfv⟩, σ z
j (t) = ⟨ˆSzj⟩and ⟨ˆFph⟩= ⟨ˆF1,2⟩= 0 in average. As a result, from (13.19) we

Social Laser: Mean Field Framework
13.3.2.1
Schematic Presentation
Let’s consider how the social laser system may be recognized in the framework of
Eq. (13.20). Schematically, the social laser is shown in Fig. 13.3b.
At the core of social laser in Fig. 13.3b there is a social network system, which
plays the role of the gain medium as it occurs with a usual physical laser device, cf.
Fig. 13.3a. We propose so-called (social) s-atoms representing DM agents, which
we model as a simple quantum-like TLS. For the social laser model we consider
a ground state as emotionally neutral state. The “upper” state may be identiﬁed as
emotionally excited (anger or happiness) state possessing some other social energy
Ee. In Fig. 13.3c we summarize possible decisions of the agent in the framework of
social laser paradigm. Such decisions are inherent to spreading or not, some socially
actual information by a DM agent. In contrast to the routine Shannon’s information
approach, here we discuss so-called s(social)-information related to some social news
and events, which are meaningful only in terms of the problem for DM agents. The
social ﬁeld, E, possesses social energy, ω, and acts as a carrier for s-information
establishing social inﬂuence as a result.

13.3 Non-equilibrium Phase Transition in Social Laser
223
Thus, we can recognize s-information spreading as a process of “absorption”
and “emission” of s-quanta performed by spatially distributed DM agents similar to
“common” two-level atoms, see Fig. 13.3c. Practically, we can consider these quanta
of s-information as meaningful messages (like posts, tweets, retweets, emails, etc.),
containing some contextual information.
Emotional excitation of the agent emerges in two ways. Each act of s-photon
absorption evokes probabilistic excitation of DM agent, which for simplicity pos-
sesses only two |g⟩and |e⟩quantum-like mental states, respectively, see Fig. 13.3c.
On the other hand, an agent can change his/her state |g⟩to |e⟩under the mass media
pump inﬂuence.
Anagentinexcited(emotional)state|e⟩canreturnbacktoitsoriginal(emotionally
neutral ground) state in several ways as well. The transition of DM agent to state
|g⟩occurs spontaneously, emitting s-photon (posting or publishing some tweet, for
example). Stimulated transition to ground state |g⟩that is accompanied with emission
of s-photon occurs in the presence of external s-photon, see Fig. 13.3c. The stimulated
transitions, which occur in social laser coherently, are especially responsible for the
ampliﬁcation of information ﬁeld. Spontaneous emission processes are incoherent;
in physics they exhibit quantum nature of matter-light interaction [188, 325, 408,
421].
On the contrary, information ampliﬁcation occurs due to (socially) stimulated
emission process. As shown in Fig. 13.3c, stimulated emission presumes posting of
a message stimulated by another. Remarkably, in this situation a DM agent can post
spontaneous content, which reﬂects his/her feelings.
Roughly speaking, messages posted spontaneously may be distinguished from a
stimulated one only by analyzing the posting time. We expect socially stimulated
posts of a DM agent to appear within the time when his/her followers are online.
In this sense stimulated posts occur coherently as an immediate response to some
discussions and posts appearing in social media. On the contrary, spontaneous emis-
sion occurs incoherently without any connection with some events in social media.
Both of them depend on psychological state of DM agents. Moreover, in contrast
to physical systems, socially stimulated posts may appear more spontaneously since
they reﬂect some emotional variability of a DM agent for time moment of online
posting. Remarkably, in this situation decision-making appears under uncertainty
and may be described in the framework of quantum approach to human cognition.
Notably, emotionally excited agents can change their mental state without any
emission of s-photons. It may happen, for example, as a result of some discussions
(“collisions”) with some other agents. The social laser quantum paradigm accounts
all possible changes, which may occur with DM agent states |e⟩and |g⟩in the
presence of s-information or without it.
13.3.2.2
Echo Chambers and Mean Field Theory
Without driving ﬁeld P s-information disseminates in social media and may become
lost after several (or, even many) steps, which are characterized by s-photon lifetime

224

τph ∝1/κ. To be more speciﬁc, for a network community we can deﬁne τph as an
average lifespan of a post. For well-known social media, it varies from few minutes
to several months, cf. [390, 423]. For example, Twitter content changes very fast
and message gets pushed down the page quickly.
Simultaneously, we can obtain (almost exponential) decrease of public attention
to some events, for example, decreased attention to the Brexit and US presidential
elections in 2016, cf. [355]. In Eq. (13.20) the jth TLS dephasing parameter  j
is responsible for such a behavior and characterizes potential attenuation of a DM
agent’s attention to information ﬁeld E.
The situation changes drastically in the presence of so-called echo chambers
occurring with network communities, which possess absorption and re-emission of
one type of contextual information for a given community, cf. [290]. Current socially
oriented networks technically serve facilities on simultaneous s-information sharing
with many users. For example, DM agents promote s-information spreading by post-
ing, twitting, and re-twitting. The context of some meaningful information may be
speciﬁed using hashtags. New facilities of social networks have generated princi-
pally new social phenomena with information dissemination, which are called echo
chambers and homophily [214]. An echo chamber occurs in relatively close social
networks, which possess selection and reinforcement of some contextual information
(beliefs) due to information exchange and repetition inside the network, preventing
it from other opinions, rebuttal, etc. The echo chambers in social network commu-
nities appear due to homophily feature of individuals, which support tendency to be
connected together with similar people [348]. As a result, the echo chamber effect
provides information induced selection (social polarization) of users (DM agents)
who make their decisions being in good agreement with the information circulated
in an echo chamber. Moreover, when DM agents encounter non-contextual (contra-
dicting) information, they try to counteract this information and keep their beliefs.
This is not surprising since famous social media environments like Twitter, Insta-
gram, Facebook, Reddit, VK, Telegram, etc., contribute to formation of like-minded
networks, uniﬁed by some key features and preferences for the content.
Remarkably, echo chambers occurring in current social media resemble laser
resonators,whichareabletoenhancephotonlifetimeτph.Weexpectanechochamber
to sufﬁciently prolong s-information lifetime in social media as well, cf. [56]. In this
regard, we can introduce an echo chamber Q-factor parameter as cf. [313]
Q = ω
κ = ωτph
2π .
(13.21)
In currently available quantum technologies high Q-factor resonators fulﬁll condition
Q ≫1 [444]. The Q-factor for social echo chambers is a sophisticated question. We
can suppose that high Q-factor echo chambers fulﬁll the condition ω ≫2π/τph.
Clearly, such a condition may be achieved with some news representing keystone
topics and remarkable events (like Brexit, Arab Spring, US elections, etc.) admitting
frequent information re-circulation (in some form) and long time discussions. The
discussions enable to examine steady state regimes of social behavior. Homophily as

13.3 Non-equilibrium Phase Transition in Social Laser

an important social peculiarity may be associated here with the assumption that DM
agents (TLS) interact with some common s-information ﬁeld E, which is contextual
(resonant) to the most part of DM agents within chosen social media (or networks),
see (13.20). The interaction strength of a single TLS with E is characterized with
g-parameter, see (13.20). Practically, we can recognize g as the rate, at which single
DM agent polarization appears due to the interaction with echo chamber information
ﬁeld.
The tendency of DM agents to interact with only one type of s-information (which
supports echo chamber) promotes a single mode regime when a social system pro-
duces one large macroscopic information ﬁeld E, [56]. This regime may also be
recognized as a information laser limit, cf. [287].
13.3.2.3
Dynamics
We may recognize social laser as a “usual” laser possessing complex network
medium, which mimics a real-world social system and undergoes strong external
information pressure. In this regard, we assume that in the regime of social laser each
of TLS adiabatically follows information ﬁeld E, which evolves with frequency ω.
To be more speciﬁc, we consider solutions of Eq. (13.20) setting E(t) = Ee−iωt,
P(t) = Pe−iωt and p j(t) = p je−iωt, which remove “fast” oscillations from Eq.
(13.20). Setting ˙σ z
j (t) = 0 we assume that within new time scales population imbal-
ance slowly varies with time. Then, from Eq. (13.20) we obtain

where  j ≡ω j −ω is detuning from the resonant interaction of TLS with s-ﬁeld.
Detuning simply characterizes opinion diversity of a DM agent (described by fre-
quency ω j) from the information mode (with frequency ω) supported by echo cham-
ber. From quantum theory, it is known that the resonance condition implies  j = 0,
which corresponds to maximal excitation of TLS. For large values of  j the proba-
bility of TLS excitation vanishes as W ∝1/((2g)2 + 2), cf. [409].
In the framework of social science  j indicates how s-information (which is
carried out by ﬁeld E) is sensitive (relevant, contextual) to internal mental levels of
the jth DM agent. In practice,  j represents a stochastic (in time) variable obeying
a distribution function. However, in the presence of strong echo chamber effect a
social network system clearly exhibits extreme polarization of social community,
which may be described by macroscopic population of two DM levels, cf. [398].
Thus, in this limit we expect to obtain  j ≃0 for all DM agents afﬁliated with a
given echo chamber.

We examine laser solution of Eq. (13.22), which is reminiscent to phase transition
paradigm, cf. [188]. In the zeroth-order approximation we can assume that σ z

(13.25)
Equation (13.25) admits clear interpretation in the framework of current studies
of echo chamber effect occurring in social media. As known, echo chambers promote
polarization of social network communities shifting the entire group’s ideology to
the extreme. Especially, it is clearly seen in social networks with political context, cf.
[59, 105]. Such a polarization exhibits strong bimodality of the distribution function
for DM agents [56]. Moreover, due to psychological reasons DM agents work to shift
their opinion within echo chamber realities. As it is follows from (13.25) polarization
almost linearly grows with E; the polarization is maximal for  j ≃0, i.e., in the
limit of suppression of opinion diversity.

Equations (13.29) and (13.30) represent one of the key results of this work. In
particular, social laser gain medium implies dependence σz,thr ∝1/⟨k⟩, which imply
threshold-less laser phenomena (σthr →0) within anomalous domain 1 < γ < 2.

scaling law for matter-ﬁeld interaction strength g if it occurs in gases, lattices envi-
ronments, cf, [313]. However, as we can see from (13.31), the network environment
can improve this scaling √⟨k⟩times. Since ⟨k⟩may be large enough (see anomalous
domain in Fig.13.2a), collective parameter G admits signiﬁcant improvement.
The macroscopic parameter of population imbalance σz in laser theory plays a role

In this sense, the social laser represents a low-threshold laser system due to network
peculiarities. On the other hand, for a given population imbalance, σz Eq. (13.28),
deﬁnes a threshold average node degree ⟨k⟩thr in the form

(13.32)

Social Laser and Networks Within Mean Field Theory
Comparing (13.28) with (13.14), we can conclude that information ﬁeld amplitude
E (instead of Sz) represents the order parameter for dissipative phase transition to
the laser (to be more speciﬁc, hereafter we are ﬁxing the phase by considering real
E), [178]. We rewrite (13.28) as

(13.34)
Notably, coefﬁcients A, B may be also obtained from laser rate-equations, cf. [399].
From (13.33) it is possible to infer that (phase) transition to lasing occurs at A = 0.

(13.35)
Thus, above the threshold, i.e., for network nodes N, which admit condition
⟨k⟩≥⟨k⟩thr an establishment of ﬁnite (non-zero) information (social) ﬁeld E occurs;
it is accomplished with nonzero polarization (excitation) of TLS. We can recast order
parameter E in the vicinity of ⟨k⟩≃⟨k⟩thr through pumping P as

(13.36)
where ζ3,thr is normalized third-order degree correlation parameter ζ3 taken at the
threshold point, cf. (13.8). The right-hand part of the equation in (13.36) is valid for
the networks for which ζ3 approaches ⟨k⟩2
thr.
Equations (13.11)–(13.17) and (13.29)–(13.36) demonstrate an analogy between
phase transitions occurring in the Ising model, which is considered by current social
networks studies, and the social laser model, which we establish here, cf. [119].
In particular, an average node degree becomes a vital parameter for both of them
within a random regime of complex networks where ζ2,3 admits factorization, i.e.,
for γ > 3, see Fig. 13.2.
Dependence (13.36) for information ﬁeld on social mass media pump P plays a
crucial role in social laser features. In physics, gain medium pumped by strong clas-
sical ﬁeld, which may be coherent or incoherent, see Fig. 13.3a. The latter possesses
a broad spectrum [421]. In the framework of social studies, the role of coherent
mass-media pump is straightforward. It strongly supports echo chamber transition
frequency ω. The role of an incoherent social mass-media pump may be much more
interesting, since in this case DM agents are inﬂuenced by strong and wide spectrum

of different viewpoints. However, even in this case the social pumping effect may
be strong enough due to so-called conﬁrmation bias, which results from individuals’
feature to absorb information in a way that conﬁrms one’s prior beliefs supported
by an echo chamber. In social networks conﬁrmation bias possess ampliﬁcation by
means of so-called ﬁlter bubbles; they display only the information that individuals
are likely to agree with, while excluding opposing views [315].
13.4
Social Laser Dynamics and Information Spread
13.4.1
Viral Information Cascades in Social Laser
Modern social media creates unprecedented opportunities for DM agents to inﬂuence
each other. This is facilitated by various Internet-based resources sharing applica-
tions (e.g., YouTube), blogs and microblogs (e.g., LiveJournal, Twitter etc.), social
networks (e.g., Facebook, Myspace, VKontakte). In this sense, information ﬁeld E
responsible for the inﬂuence of DM agents cannot be considered as a constant in
time, cf. (13.36).
For example, some information published by the user can almost immediately
become “viral” and accessible to millions of people. It can provoke a rapid growth of
so-called information cascades [101, 455]. In this case, dissemination of information
in social media is the object for close attention of researchers who work in the ﬁeld
of mathematics, computer science, statistical physics, sociology, and psychology.
Time dependent phenomena for the social laser may be inferred from Ginzburg–
Landau equation (13.26). In particular, from (13.26) for average s-photon number
variable n ph = E2 (which corresponds to number of retweets, as example) we obtain
˙n ph = 2An ph −2Bn2
ph + 2P(t)√n ph,
(13.37)
where we recover slow time dependence of pump P →P(t) on time.
Equation (13.37) may be recognized as a rate equation for the number of pho-
tons generated by laser at the output, cf. [188]. In the framework of social media
studies, the similar equation (with P = 0) characterizes a so-called susceptible-
infected-susceptible (SIS) epidemic model, which describes information spread in
social media based on the growth of infected agents population, cf. [45, 375]. Recent
remarkable applications of such a model to rumor and misinformation spreading are
given in [218, 343].
In laser theory, the pump ﬁeld plays a crucial role. It is used to create required
population inversion σz. Then, the pump may be switched-off, P = 0. In this limit,
Eq. (13.37) admits a simple analytical solution
n ph =

Pump rates are: P = 0 (blue curve), P = 1 (red curve), P(t) = sin(0.37t) (green curve), P(t) =
sin(1.3t) (magenta curve), and P(t) = e−0.12t (black curve), respectively. b Viral Information cas-
cade in social laser network. The cascade starts with a socially stimulated repost (retweet) in the
presence of spontaneously posted message, which together deliver information to two other agents
in the network and initiate new “spontaneously” or socially stimulated messages. The messages
occur in accordance with the rules explained in Fig. 13.3c
where we deﬁne v = ¯n/(A −B ¯n); ¯n is an average photon number at initial time
t = 0.
Figure 13.4a exhibits another important result of this work and explains the role
of the mass media pump in the social laser. As seen in Fig. 13.4a, we plot solutions of
Eq. (13.37) for s-photon average number n ph for various pump P(t). We can suppose
that n ph describes reinforcement of some viral information supported by the echo
chamber. Parameter g2⟨k⟩σz/ in this case simply describes message diffusion rate
whereas κ characterizes recovery rate; the s-photons escape from the echo chamber,
which ampliﬁes this information with rate κ, cf. Eq. (13.28).
The blue curve in Fig. 13.4a is relevant to typical S-shape behavior, which is
relevant to the SIS model and characterizes the (exponential) growth of n ph above
the threshold (A > 0). The pump ﬁeld creates the social laser threshold and then
switches off, P = 0. This limit corresponds to growing information cascade, which
is schematically depicted in Fig. 13.4b. In the social laser, a cascade starts with a
“spontaneously” posted message. Then, in the presence of required inversion, or a
relevant average node degree this message evokes avalanche of messages (s-photons)
in the network created by other DM agents as a result of socially stimulated emission
phenomena, cf. Fig. 13.3b.
In particular, such a cascade may be described in the framework of cascade gen-
erating function, which characterizes details of cascade microscopic dynamics, cf.
patterns (3), (5) given in Fig.2 of [173]. At the same time, the information cas-
cade shown in Fig. 13.4b may be explained in the framework of structural virality
paradigm, which considers viral information diffusion [177].

13.4 Social Laser Dynamics and Information Spread
231
In the presence of the pump of mass media an average s-photon number, as it is
shown Fig. 13.4a, follows pump main features. In particular, a permanent pump pos-
sesses essential acceleration of information diffusion, see the red curve in Fig. 13.4a.
For the black and magenta curves we suppose that P(t) = P0sin[νt], where P0
is a pump ﬁeld amplitude, and ν is frequency of the pump variation. In adiabatic
approximation (ν ≪ω) DM agents follows mass media pump evolution, which is
clearly seen for the black and magenta curves behavior shown in Fig. 13.4a, respec-
tively. Within the established time window, the green curve may be associated with
power-law decay of an information cascade. In contrast, the black line in Fig. 13.4a
characterizes the exponential decay of the cascade demolished by mass media pump
P(t) = P0e−νet. Within the large time window, it approaches the blue curve obtained
at P = 0.
Thus, the plots in Fig. 13.4a may reproduce a variety of information cascade
properties obtained experimentally depending on a mass media pump ﬁeld action
P(t), cf. [105, 198, 218, 346, 390].
In particular, the SIS model in the framework of social laser possesses simple
and very elegant interpretation. The DM agent is initially susceptible to s-photon.
The s-photon absorption evokes infection of the agent with some probability, which
corresponds to transition to the excited state. Then, s-photon emission (which practi-
cally implies posting a tweet, for example) changes the s-photon number (number of
tweets) and simultaneously transfers DM agent to the ground state back. Notably, the
same agent again becomes susceptible to absorb s-photon, which agrees with basic
SIS model predictions, [218, 343]. Thus, the total number of emitted s-photons in
the social laser model is accompanied with diminishing of population inversion. The
lasing threshold in this case corresponds to the epidemic threshold.
If the lasing threshold does not fulﬁll (A < 0), the properties of n ph strictly depend
on the pump P. In particular, in this limit it is possible to obtain
n ph = (eAt(A
√
¯n + P) −P)2
A2
,
(13.39)
For A < 0 Eq. (13.39) provides critical pump ﬁeld Pc = A2 ¯n when n ph = ¯n. For
P > Pc the n ph grows exponentially.
13.4.2
Velocity of Information Reinforced
This is a keystone question that we can address to the social laser paradigm from
the beginning. Up to date it is unclear how network peculiarities affect social laser
gain medium, cf. Fig. 13.3b. As we have already pointed out, Fig. 13.4 and (13.38)
may be understood in the framework of various models of disease spreading. To be
more speciﬁc, even simple SI model can help to create a link between information
growth presented in Fig. 13.4a and network peculiarities. To demonstrate that, let us
examine the social laser model well above the threshold with a switched-off pump

ﬁeld, P = 0 (we can simply neglect by κ for the SI model in this limit). At any time
moment we suppose that all DM agents in a social network belong to two large classes
of “infected” or “susceptible” individuals. A DM agent belongs to set of “infected”
population if he/she posts a message about some potentially viral content. Otherwise,
he/she is “susceptible” (S). Notably, transfer from “infected” to “susceptible” agents
within this model is not provided, which is clearly inherent to the SI approach.
We suppose that an infected agent posts the message, which is passed to a suscep-
tibleone (here we refer to so-called SI model for simplicity). Both of them are part of
the social laser social network community, see Fig. 13.4b. Within the time interval
dt a probability that corresponds to the message passage to a susceptible agent is ϵdt
(we suppose that ϵ is small enough, ϵdt ≪1). Then, let us assume that susceptible
agent j possesses node degree k j. In this case a “susceptible” agent receives the
message (becomes infected) with probability ϵk jdt.
The enhancement of this probability k j times is obvious: people more intensively
communicated with individuals who possess more (communicative) links in social
media. Let us assume that k j approaches its average value ⟨k⟩. Fraction of nodes
with average degree k, which are “infected” in the network, is deﬁned as I, and
the fraction, which are not “infected”, is deﬁned as 1 −I, respectively. A simple
equation that governs I variable is represented as (cf. [45])
˙I = ϵ(1 −I)⟨k⟩I.
(13.40)
The solution of Eq. (13.40) is
I =
I0eϵ⟨k⟩t
1 −I0 + I0eϵ⟨k⟩t ,
(13.41)
where I (t = 0) = I0 deﬁnes the initial condition.
Comparing Eq. (1.12) with (13.38) we can conclude that ϵ ≃2g2σz/.
Equation (1.12) provides a deﬁnition of characteristic time scale tk required to
achieve 1/e fraction of all “susceptible” DM agents; from (1.12) we obtain
tk =
1
ϵ⟨k⟩≃1
2A,
(13.42)
where we omit the term with κ, which is relevant to losses.
The obtained in (13.42) plays an important role for complex networks with the
power-law degree distribution, which mimics a real-life social media. Actually, the
characteristic time scale tk is inversely proportional to the rate, at which a viral
message spreads through social media. As it is followed from the inset to Fig. 13.2,
social networks with degree exponent γ > 3 may be recognized as socially passive in
the framework of interaction exchange. The situation changes in the social laser limit.
Echo chambers provide increasing of information exchange and social excitation
of network agents. For the networks with power-law degree distribution it means
vanishing degree exponent γ , which leads to clusterization and hubs appearing,

13.5 Concluding Discussion on Social Laser and Networks
233
cf. Fig. 13.1. The rate of information transfer enormously increases (tk vanishes)
within anomalous network domain 1 < γ < 2 which corresponds to growing ⟨k⟩.
Notably, such an effect almost no longer depends on κ. This regime corresponds to a
so-called superstrong coupling regime, when coupling between TLSs and resonator
ﬁeld behaves strongly enough during one round trip in the resonator, cf. [350]. Hence,
we can conclude that in the framework of social laser paradigm we can expect huge
acceleration of information spread and rapid information cascade, which result from
a superstrong coupling regime. We can represent such a condition in the form
G ≫,
κ,
ωFSR,
(13.43)
where ωFSR is a free spectral range of the resonator, which is inversely proportional
to the “size” of the resonator [350].
In quantum physics, a strong coupling regime provides observation of various
coherent matter-ﬁeld interaction effects, like exciton-polariton Bose–Einstein con-
densates [124]. Roughly speaking, in this limit we need no population imbalance at
all. It may be also seen from deﬁnition (13.29); threshold value of σthr vanishes at
g(k) ≫κ,  for large N, cf. Fig. 13.2b.
We expect that it is possible to obtain condition (13.43) by choosing an appropriate
network topology within 1 < γ < 2 domain. This result represents an important
impact for current social science. It means that in the presence of a strong mass media
pump and echo chambers occurring in social media we do not need to obtain a large
population inversion, which leads to large number of emotionally excited people. It
is enough to have some strong majority who can attract people, create echo chambers
in social networks, and provide necessary network communicative topology (which
characterized by some speciﬁc γ for power-law networks, in particular). It is worth
noticing that huge information cascades in this situation appear due to a spontaneous
DM process. Then, all population is likely to follow these cascades.
13.5
Concluding Discussion on Social Laser and Networks
The social laser concept explains growing and fast-paced processes generated in
current social media. The social laser, as the physical laser device, contains all key-
stone elements, which are necessary for reinforcement of social information. At the
core of the social laser is social network media, which may be modeled (with some
approximation) by means of networks whose degree distribution follows power law.
The DM agents, which we established as simple quantum TLS, occupy the nodes
of this network (we consider the case where each agent occupies only one node).
An echo chamber, which mimics an optical resonator known from physical laser
device, represents a key feature of social media. In particular, echo chamber may
provide enhancement of one privileged s-information mode. We have demonstrated
a clear link between the social laser and Ising model. The Ising model is used in
sociophysics that considers networks and characterizes a social impact. Unlike the

234
13
Social Laser and Networks Within Mean Field Theory
Ising model, the social laser accounts for elementary processes of s-photon absorp-
tion, spontaneous emission, and (socially) stimulated emission, which are relevant to
on-line information exchange between DM agents in the network. As a result, social
lasing represents a coherent non-equilibrium process that implies the formation of
macroscopic social polarization, (viral) information cascade creation in the presence
of population imbalance (social bias).
In this chapter, we use by mean-ﬁeld theory, which has a twofold meaning for
a social laser system. In particular, we obtain a set of equations to describe the
social laser in mean-ﬁeld approximation, which deals with average values of relevant
operators and neglect all quantum (Langevin) noises. We examine a network structure
inthelimitwhenﬂuctuationsofnodedegreemaybeneglected.Inthiscase,featuresof
thesociallyorientedIsingmodelandsociallaserprovidetheexistenceofsomecritical
average node degree, which deﬁnes the second-order phase transition threshold for
the network topology and nodes.
In this limit, it was shown that a coherent information ﬁeld represents the order
parameter and provides a huge social impact in social laser network media.
An important difference between the social laser and currently actual models of
echo chambers and related phenomena is the presence of a mass media pump, which
plays a crucial role in social laser generic features. The mass media pump provides
population inversion required for lasing occurrence in the presence of various decay
mechanisms. In this work, we establish a clear link between the SIS/SI epidemiolog-
ical models and the social laser rate equation for an average number of s-photons,
which may be simply recognized as an average total number of messages posted or
tweeted in a social network. We have shown that the social laser ﬁeld immediately
generates information cascades occurring in social media. Remarkably, the mass
media pump enables to reinforce and accelerate cascade growth in different ways.
Notably, DM agents follow an adiabatically time dependent mass media pump, which
acts in a social network community and contributes to the reproduction of various
reliable scenarios for information cascade evolution in time. We have achieved an
important result, which relates to seminal features of parameter g(k) that charac-
terizes coupling strength of DM agent with social laser s-information modes; we
have shown that g(k) is proportional to √⟨k⟩for the network structure possessing
average node degree ⟨k⟩. We have shown that the time of information spreading in a
social network is inversely proportional to average node degree ⟨k⟩, which may be
large enough in social laser systems. As a result, we can obtain a huge information
cascade and social impact at the “output” of the social laser, which is manipulated
by the mass media pump.

Part V
Boundaries of Applicability
of Quantum-Like Modeling
Application of the quantum methodology and formalism to decision-making was
stimulated by the paradoxes and inconsistencies of the CP-based theory, probability
fallacies, and visible irrationality of people’s behavior in some cognitive and social
contexts (irrationality which was also framed in the CP framework). Appealing to
quantum theory is only one possible way to proceed nonclassically. May be this
theory does not cover the whole body of the cognitive phenomena. In this part, we
analyze this complex problem. In Chap.14, we show that the description of questions
by von Neumann observables has restricted applicability. In Chap.15, we discuss the
possibility that the probabilistic structure of the cognitive phenomena is even more
exotic than the structure of quantum probabilities. Here we follow Sorkin, who
analyzed a similar problem in physics.

Neumann Observables
14.1
Sequential Measurements in Physics and Psychology
Onaverygenerallevel,QMaccountsfortheprobabilitydistributionsofmeasurement
results using two kinds of entities, called observables a and states ψ (of the system on
which the measurements are made). Let us assume that measurements are performed
in a series of consecutive trials numbered 1, 2, . . .. In each trial t the experimenter
decides what measurement to make (e.g., what question to ask), and this amounts
to choosing an observable a. In a psychological experiment the a-values are the
responses that a participant is allowed to give, such as Yes and No.
The probabilities of these outcomes in trial t (conditioned on all the previous
measurements and their outcomes) are computed as some function of the observable
a and of the state ψ(t) in which the system (a particle in quantum physics, or a
participant in psychology) is at the beginning of trial t,
P [a = v in trial t | measurements in trials 1, . . . , t −1] = F

ψ(t), a, v

. (14.1)
This measurement changes the state of the system, so that at the end of trial t the
state is ψ(t+1), generally different from ψ(t). The change ψ(t) →ψ(t+1) depends on
the observable a, the state ψ(t), and the value a = v observed in trial t,
ψ(t+1) = G

ψ(t), a, v

(14.2)
On this level of generality, a psychologist will easily recognize in (14.1)–(14.2)
a probabilistic version of the time-honored Stimulus-Organism-Response (S-O-R)
scheme for explaining behavior [469]. This scheme involves stimuli (corresponding
to a), responses (corresponding to v), and internal states (corresponding to ψ). It
does not matter whether one simply identiﬁes a with a stimulus, or interprets a as a
kind of internal representation thereof, while interpreting the stimulus itself as part
of the measurement procedure (together with the instructions and experimental set-
up, that are usually ﬁxed for the entire sequence of trials). What is important is that

No-Go Theorem for Modeling with Von Neumann Observables
the stimulus determines the observable a uniquely, so that if the same stimulus is
presented in two different trials t and t′, one can assume that a is the same in both
of them.
The state ψ(t+1) determined by (14.2) may remain unchanged between the
response v terminating trial t and the presentation of (the stimulus corresponding
to) the new observable that initiates trial t + 1. In some applications this interval
can indeed be negligibly small or even zero, but if it is not, one has to allow for the
evolution of ψ(t+1) within it. In QM, the “pure” evolution of the state (assuming no
intervening inter-trial inputs) is described by some function
ψ(t+1)

= H

ψ(t+1), 

,
(14.3)
where  is the time interval between the recording of v in trial t and the observable
in trial t + 1. This scheme is somewhat simplistic: one could allow H to depend, in
addition to the time interval , on the observable a and the outcome v in trial t. We
do not consider such complex inter-trial dynamics schemes in this chapter.
The reason we single out opinion polling and compare it to psychophysics is that
they exemplify two very different types of stimulus-response relations.
In a typical opinion polling experiment, a group of participants is asked one
question at a time, e.g., a = “Is Bill Clinton honest and trustworthy?” and b = “Is
Al Gore honest and trustworthy?” [359]. The two questions, obviously, differ from
each other in many respects, none of which has anything to do with their content: the
words “Clinton” and “Gore” sound different, and the participants know many aspects
in which Clinton and Gore differ, besides their honesty or dishonesty. Therefore, if a
question, say, b, were presented to a participant more than once, she would normally
recognize that it had already been asked, which in turn would compel her to repeat it,
unlessshewantstocontradictherself.Onecanthinkofsituationswhentherespondent
can change her opinion, e.g., if another question posed between two replications of
the question provides new information or reminds something forgotten. Thus, if the
answer to the question a = “Do you want to eat this chocolate bar?” is Yes, and the
second question is b = “Do you want to lose weight?,” the replications of a may
very well elicit response No. It is even conceivable that if one simply repeats the
chocolate question twice, the person will change her mind, as she may think the
replication of the question is intended to make her “think again.” In a wide class of
situations, however, changing one’s response would be highly unexpected and even
bizarre (e.g., replace a in the example above with “Do you like chocolate?”). We
assume that the pairs of questions asked, e.g., in Moore’s study [359] are of this type.
In a typical psychophysical task, the stimuli used are identical in all respects except
for the property that a participant is asked to judge. Consider a simple detection
paradigm in which the observer is presented one stimulus at a time, the stimulus
being either a (containing a signal to be detected) or b (the “empty” stimulus, in
which the signal is absent). For instance, a may be a tilted line segment, and b the
same line segment but vertical, the tilt (which is the signal to be detected) being too
small for all answers to be correct. Clearly, the participant in such an experiment

14.1 Sequential Measurements in Physics and Psychology
239
cannot ﬁrst decide that the stimulus being presented now has already been presented
before, and that it has to be judged to be a because so it was before.
With this distinction in mind, however, the formalism (14.1)–(14.3) can be equally
applied to both types of situations. In both cases we can consider some observables
a and b.
The values of a and b are the possible responses one records. In the psychophys-
ical example, a = va and b = vb each can attain one of two values: 1 = “I think the
stimulus was tilted” or 0 = “I think the stimulus was vertical”. The psychophysical
analysis consists in identifying the hit-rate and false-alarm-rate functions (condi-
tioned on the previous stimuli and responses)

, S ∈{a, b} , v ∈{0, 1} ,
(14.5)
combined with the “pure” inter-trial dynamics (14.3).
In the opinion polling example (say, about Clinton’s and Gore’s honesty), there
are two hypothetical observables: a, corresponding to the question a =“Is Bill Clin-
ton honest?”, and b, corresponding to the question b =“Is Al Gore honest?”, each
observable having two possible values, 0 =“Yes” and 1 =“No”. The analysis, for-
mally, is precisely the same as above, except that one no longer uses the terms “hits”
and “false alarms” (because “honesty” is not a signal objectively present in one of
the two politicians and absent in another).
It is worth noting that in the opinion polling the observables a, b are deﬁned by the
corresponding questions alone only because the allowable responses (Yes or No) and
the instructions (“Respond to this question”) do not vary from one trial to another.
If the allowable responses varied (e.g., if they were Yes and No in some trials, and
Yes, No, and Not Sure in other trials), or if the instruction varied (say, in some trials
“Respond as quickly as possible”, in other trials “Think carefully and respond”),
they would have also contributed to the identiﬁcation of the observables.
Analogously, in our psychophysics example, the observables are deﬁned by stim-
uli alone because the instruction to the participants (“Tell us whether the line you
see is tilted or vertical”) and the responses allowed (“Tilted” and “Vertical”) remain
ﬁxed throughout the successive trials.
In quantum physics, a classical example falling within the same formal scheme
as the examples above is one involving measuring the spin of a particle in a given
direction. Let the experimenter choose one of two possible directions, a or b (unit
vectors in space along which the experimenter sets a spin detector). If the particle is
a spin- 1
2 one, such as an electron, then the spin for each direction chosen can have
one of two possible values, 1 =“up” or 0 =“down” (we need not discuss the physical
meaning of these designations). These 1 and 0 are then the possible values of the

240
14

observables a and b one associates with the two directions, and the analysis again
consists in identifying the functions F, G, and H.
14.2
Von Neumann Observables and Unitary
Inter-measurement Evolution
For simplicity (and because all our examples involve binary outcomes), in this chapter
we will only deal with the observables a that have two possible values, denoted 0
and 1. This means that all our observables can be presented as Hermitian operators
of the projection type1
A = E1,
(14.6)
and

1 = E1, E0E1 = 0, E0 + E1 = I.

of the eigenspace V associated with v, which is the space spanning the d pairwise
orthogonal eigenvectors associated with v (i.e., the space of all linear combinations of
these eigenvectors). Multiplication of Ev by any vector x is the orthogonal projection
of this vector into V . If d = 1, the eigenspace V is the ray containing a unique unit
length eigenvector of A corresponding to v. The eigenvalue 1 −v has the multiplicity
n −d, the dimensionality of the eigenspace V ⊥which is orthogonal to V . If both
d = 1 and n −d = 1 (i.e., n = 2), then A is said to have a non-degenerate spectrum.
We assume the spectra are generally degenerate (n ≥2).
The eigenvalues 0, 1 of A in a given trial generally cannot be predicted, but one
can predict the probabilities of their occurrence. To compute these probabilities, QM
uses the notion of a state of the system. In any given trial the state is unique, and it
is represented by a unit length state vector ψ.2 If the system is in a state ψ(t) in trial
t, and the measurement is performed on the observable a given by operator A, the
probabilities of the outcomes of this measurement are given by

1 These are observables of the von Neumann type, see Chaps. 16 and 8. As we know from theory of
quantum instruments, it is not enough to determine observables and, hence, the probabilities of their
outcomes. We also have to determine the form of the state update resulting from measurement’s
feedback action; in this chapter it is given by Lüders postulate. Reﬁned said, we consider quantum
instruments of the von Neumann-Lüders class (Chap. 8, Sect. 8.1).
2 For simplicity, we assume throughout the chapter that the system is always in a pure state. A more
general mixed state is represented by a density matrix, which is essentially a set of up to n distinct
pure states occurring with some probabilities. The same as with the assumption that n is ﬁnite, the
restriction of our analysis to pure states is not critical.

where v = 0, 1. Note that these probabilities are conditioned on the previous observ-
ables, in trials 1, . . . , t −1, and their observed values.

This equation represents the von Neumann-Lüders projection postulate of QM. The
denominator is nonzero because it is the square root of P [a = v in trial t], and (14.9)
is predicated on v having been observed. The geometric meaning of G



is
that ψ(t) is orthogonally projected by Ev into the eigenspace V and then normalized
to unit length.
Finally, the inter-trial dynamics of the state vector in QM (between v and the next
observable, separated by interval ) is represented by the unitary evolution formula

(14.10)
where U is a unitary matrix, deﬁned by the property

.
(14.11)
Here, U −1
 is the matrix inverse (U −1
 U = UU −1
 = I), and U †
 is the conjugate
transpose of U, obtained by transposing U and replacing each entry x + iy in
it with its complex conjugate x −iy. The unitary matrix U should also be made
a function of inter-trial variations in the environment (such as variations in overall
noise level, or other participants’ responses) if they are non-negligible. The identity
matrix I is a unitary matrix: if U = I, (14.10) describes no inter-trial dynamics,
with the state remaining the same through the interval .
Note that the eigenvalue v itself does not enter the computations. This justiﬁes
treating it as merely a label for the eigenprojectors and eigenspaces (so instead of
0, 1 we could use any other labels).
14.3
Measurement Sequences: Evolution (In)Effectiveness
and Stability
In this section we introduce terminology and preliminary considerations needed in
the subsequent analysis. Throughout the chapter we will make use of the following
way of describing measurements performed in successive trials:
(a1, v1, p1) →· · · →(ar, vr, pr) .
(14.12)

242
14
No-Go Theorem for Modeling with Von Neumann Observables
We call this a measurement sequence. Each triple in the sequence consists of an
observable a being measured, an outcome v recorded (0 or 1), and its conditional
probability p. The probability is conditioned on the observables measured and the
outcomes recorded in the previous trials of the same measurement sequence. Thus,
p1 = P [a1 = v1 in trial 1] ,
p2 = P [a2 = v2 in trial 2 | a1 = v1 in trial 1] ,
p2 = P [a3 = v3 in trial 3 | a1 = v1 in trial 1, and a2 = v2 in trial 2] ,
. . .
(14.13)
As we assume that the outcomes v1, v2, . . . in a measurement sequence have been
recorded, all probabilities p1, p2, . . . are positive if the measurement sequence exists.
Recall that the observables a1, a2, . . . in a sequence are uniquely determined by the
measurement procedures applied, a1, a2, . . ., and that the outcomes (0 or 1) are
eigenvalues of these observables.
Consider now the two-trial measurement sequence
(a, v, p) →(b, w, q) ,
(14.14)
where v, w ∈{0, 1}. Let the quantum observable A (representing the question a)
have the eigenprojectors E0, E1, and the quantum observable B (representing the
question b) have the eigenprojectors Q0, Q1; hence, A and B are represented by
projection operators A = E1 and B = Q1, respectively.
If the initial state of the system is ψ = ψ(1), we have
p = ∥Evψ∥2,
(14.15)
and ψ(1) transforms into
Evψ
∥Evψ∥= ψ(2).
(14.16)
Assuming an interval  between the two trials, ψ(2) evolves into
ψ(2)
 = Uψ(2) = UEvψ
∥Evψ∥.
(14.17)
This is the state vector paired with B in the next measurement, yielding, with the
help of some algebra,
q = ∥Qwψ(2)

∥Evψ∥2
=


U †

.
(14.18)
As a special case U can be the identity matrix (no inter-trial changes in the state
vector), and then we have

14.3 Measurement Sequences: Evolution (In)Effectiveness and Stability
243
q = ∥QwEvψ∥2
∥Evψ∥2
,
(14.19)
because in this case

U †

(14.20)
It is possible, however, that the latter equality holds even if U †
 is not the identity
matrix. In fact it is easy to see that this happens if and only if U and B commute,
i.e.,
UB = BU.
(14.21)
For the proof of this, see paper [262].
We will say that
Deﬁnition 14.3.1 A unitary operator U is ineffective for a quantum observable B
given by the operator B if the two operators commute.
□
The justiﬁcation for this terminology should be transparent: due to (14.20), in the
computation (14.18) of the probability q the evolution operator can be ignored,
yielding (14.19). The notion of inefﬁciency of the evolution operator will play an
important role in the analysis of repeated measurements below.
Our next consideration regards the set of all possible values of the initial state
vector ψ for a given measurement sequence. In the applications of QM in physics,
this set is assumed to cover the entire Hilbert space in which they are deﬁned. We
are not justiﬁed to adopt this assumption in psychology, it would be too strong: one
could argue that the initial states in a given experiment may be forbidden to attain
values within certain areas of the Hilbert space. At the same time, it seems even less
reasonable to allow for the possibility that the initial state for a given measurement
sequence is always ﬁxed at one particular value. The initial state vectors, as follows
from both the QM principles and common sense, should depend on the system’s
history prior to the given experiment, and this should create some variability from
one replication of this experiment to another. This is important, because, given a set of
observables, specially chosen initial state vectors may exhibit “atypical” behaviors,
those that would disappear if the state vector were modiﬁed even slightly.
This leads us to adopting the following
Stability Principle: If ψ is a possible initial state vector for a given measure-
ment sequence in an n-dimensional Hilbert space, then there is an open ball Br (ψ)
centered at ψ with a sufﬁciently small radius r, such that any vector ψ + δ in this
ball, normalized by its length ∥ψ + δ∥, is also a possible initial state vector for this
measurement sequence.
We will say that
Deﬁnition 14.3.2 A property of a measurement sequence is (or holds) stable for an
initial vector ψ, if it holds for all state vectors within a sufﬁciently small Br (ψ). □
Almost all our propositions below are proved under this stability clause (see open
access article for the proofs [262]).

No-Go Theorem for Modeling with Von Neumann Observables
14.4
Measurement Sequences a →a
Using the deﬁnitions and the language just introduced, we will now focus on the
consequences of (14.8)–(14.10) for repeated measurements with repeated responses,
(a, v, p) →

a, v, p′
.
(14.22)
Consider an opinion polling experiment, with questions like a =“Is Bill Clinton
trustworthy?” [359]. As argued for in Sect. 14.1, if the same question is posed twice,
a →a, a typical respondent, who perhaps hesitated when choosing the response the
ﬁrst time she was asked a, would now certainly be expected to repeat it, perhaps with
some display of surprise at being asked the question she has just answered. This may
not be true for all possible questions, but it is certainly true for a vast class thereof.
Let us formulate this as
Property 1 (a →a repeatability).
For some nonempty class of questions, if a question is repeated twice in successive
trials (separated by one of a broad range of inter-trial intervals), the response to it
will also be repeated.
If a question a within the scope of this property is represented by Hermitian
operator (projection) A = E1, we are dealing with the measurement sequence (14.22)
in which p′ = 1. Such a measurement sequence does not disagree with the formulas
(14.8)–(14.9)–(14.10), and in fact is even predicted by them if the intervening inter-
trial evolution of the state vector is assumed to be ineffective. Indeed, (14.18) for the
measurement sequence (14.22) acquires the form
p′ =
∥

U †
EvU

Evψ∥2
∥Evψ∥2
,
(14.23)
and the inefﬁciency of U for a implies
p′ = ∥E2
vψ∥2
∥Evψ∥2 = 1,
(14.24)
because E2
v = Ev holds for all projection operators.
This is easy to understand informally. An outcome v observed in the ﬁrst measure-
ment, (a, v, p), is associated with an eigenspace V . The measurement orthogonally
projects the state vector ψ = ψ(1) into this eigenspace, and this projection is nor-
malized to become the new state ψ(2). The application of the same measurement to
ψ(2) orthogonally projects it into V again, but since ψ(2) is already in V , it does
not change. The squared length of the projection therefore is 1, and this is what the
probability p′ is.

14.4 Measurement Sequences a →a
245
As it turns out, under the stability principle, effective inter-trial evolution is in fact
excluded for the observables representing the questions falling within the scope of
Property 1. In other words, for all such questions, the unitary operators U can be
ignored in all probability computations. The following deﬁnition formalizes Property
1 (a →a repeatability) within the quantum formalism:
Let us say that
Deﬁnition 14.4.1 A quantum observable A representing a question a has the Lüders
property with respect to a state vector ψ if the existence of the measurement (a, v, p)
for this ψ and an outcome v ∈{0, 1} implies that the property p′ = 1 holds stable
for this ψ in the measurement sequence (a, v, p) →

a, v, p′
.
□
In other words, the Lüders property means that an answer to a question a (represented
by operator A) is repeated if the question is repeated, and that this is true not just for
one initial state vector ψ, but for all state vectors sufﬁciently close to it.
We now can formulate our ﬁrst proposition (see [262] for its proof).
Proposition 14.4.2 (repeated measurements) An observable A has the Lüders prop-
erty if and only if U in (14.10) is ineffective for A.
□
In the formulation of Property 1, the interval  and the question represented by A
can vary within some broad limits, whence the inefﬁciency of U for a should also
hold for each of these intervals combined with each of these questions.
We have to be careful not to overgeneralize the Lüders property and the ensuing
inefﬁciency property. As we discussed, one can think of situations where replications
of a question may lead the respondent to “change her mind.” The most striking
contrast, however, is provided by psychophysical applications of QM. Here, the
inter-trial dynamics not only cannot be ignored, it must play a central role.
Let us illustrate this on an old but very thorough study by Atkinson, Carterette,
and Kinchla [31]. In the experiments they report, each stimulus consisted of two side-
by-side identical ﬁelds of luminance L, to one of which a small luminance increment
L could be added, serving as the signal to be detected. There were three stimuli:
a = (L + L, L) , b = (L, L + L) , c = (L, L) .
(14.25)
In each trial the observer indicated which of the two ﬁelds, right one or left one,
contained the signal. There were thus two possible responses: Left and Right. An
application of QM analysis to these experiments requires a, b, c to be translated
into observables (Hermitian operators) A, B, C, each with two eigenvalues, say,
0 = Left and 1 = Right. In the experiments we consider no feedback was given to
the observers following a response. This is a desirable feature. It makes the sequence
of trials we consider formally comparable to successive measurements of spins in
quantum physics: measurements simply follow each other, with no interventions in
between.3
3 However, this precaution seems unnecessary, as the results of the experiments with feedback in
Ref. [31] do not qualitatively differ from the ones we discuss here.

Recall that the probabilities p′
i (i = 1, . . . , 6) are conditioned on previous measure-
ments, so that, e.g., p′
1 + p′
2 ̸= 1 while p1 + p2 = 1.
For each observer, the probabilities were estimated from the last 400 trials out of
800 (to ensure an “asymptotic” level of performance). The results, averaged over 24
observers, were as follows:

The leftmost column in each table corresponds to the index associated with p and p′
in (14.26). Thus, the ﬁrst row shows p1 and p′
1, the last one shows p6 and p′
6. The two
experiments differed in one respect only: in Experiment 1 the stimuli a and b were
presented with equal probabilities, while in Experiment 2 the stimulus b was three
times more probable that a (the probability of c was 0.2 in both experiments). The
results show, in accordance with conventional detection models, that this manipula-
tion makes responses in Experiment 2 biased toward the correct response to b. This
aspect of the data, however, is not of any signiﬁcance for us. What is signiﬁcant, is
that, in accordance with Proposition 14.4.2, we should conclude that the inter-trial
evolution (14.10) here intervenes always and signiﬁcantly.
14.5
Measurement Sequences a →b →a
Returning to the opinion polling experiments, consider the situation involving two
questions, such as a =“Is Bill Clinton honest?” and b =“Is Al Gore honest?” The
two questions are posed in one of the two orders, a →b or b →a, to a large group
of people. The same as with asking the same question twice in a row, one would
normally consider it unnecessary to extend these sequences by asking one of the two
questions again, by repeating b or a after having asked a and b. A typical respondent,
again, will be expected to repeat her ﬁrst response. We ﬁnd it “almost certain” (the
“almost” being inserted here because we cannot refer to any systematic experimental

study of this obvious expectation) that from the nonempty (in reality, vast) class of
questions falling within the scope of Property 1 one can always choose pairs of
questions falling within the scope of the following extension of this property.
Property 2 (RRE, see Chap. 1).
Within a nonempty subclass of questions (and for the same set of inter-trial intervals)
for which Property 1 holds, if a question a is asked following questions a and b (in
either order), the response to it will necessarily be the same as that given to the
question a the ﬁrst time it was asked.
Asalways,werepresentquestionsa, b withquantumobservables A, B (Hermitian
operators and projection state update resulting from measurement’s feedback action).
We use the following notation: the probability of obtaining a value v when measuring
the observable a is denoted pva, qva, etc. (the letters p, q, etc. distinguishing different
measurements); we use analogous notation for the probability of obtaining a value
w when measuring the observable b.4
Consider the measurement sequence
(a, v, pva) →(b, w, pwb) →

a, v, p′
v

(14.27)
RRE implies that in these sequences p′
va = 1 and q′
wa = 1. As it turns out, this
property has an important consequence (assuming the two inter-trial intervals in the
measurement sequences belong to the same class as  in Proposition 14.4.2).
Proposition 14.5.1 (alternating measurements)
Let observables a and b repre-
sented by operators A and B possess the Lüders property, and let the measurement
sequences
(a, v, pva) →(b, w, pwb)
(14.28)
exist for all v, w ∈{0, 1}, and some initial state vector ψ. Then, in the measurement
sequences (14.27), the property p′
va = 1 holds stable for this ψ if and only if the
operators A and B commute, AB = B A.
□
In other words, if the probabilities pva, pwb, qwb, qva are nonzero in (14.28) for
some ψ, the sequences (14.27) exist with p′
va = 1 and q′
wa = 1 for all state vectors
in a small neighborhood of ψ if and only if AB = B A. (See [262] for Proposition’s
proof.)
To illustrate how this works, recall that the Hermitian operators A and B commute
if and only if they have one and the same set of orthonormal eigenvectors e1, . . . , en
(generally, not unique). Since the operators A and B have two eigenvalues each, the
difference between the two observables is in how these eigenvectors are grouped into
two eigenspaces. Take one of the measurement sequences of the (14.27)-type, say,
(a, 1, p1a) →(b, 0, p0b) →

meaning depending on contexts.

No-Go Theorem for Modeling with Von Neumann Observables
Since A and B have the Lüders property, all the probabilities are the same as if
there was no inter-trial dynamics involved. Proceeding under this assumption, the
ﬁrst measurement projects the initial vector ψ = ψ(1) into V1 that spans some of
the vectors e1, . . . , en. Let this projection (after its length was normalized to 1) be
ψ(2). The second measurement projects ψ(2) into the intersection V1 ∩W0 that spans
a smaller subset of these vectors. The third measurement then, since the second
normalized projection ψ(3) is already in V1, does not change it, ψ(4) = ψ(3). This
means that the third probability, p′
1A, being the scalar product of ψ(3) and ψ(4), must
be unity.
The commutativity of A and B is important because it has an experimentally
testable consequence.
Proposition 14.5.2 (no order effect) If observables a and b possessing the Lüders
property commute, then in the measurement sequences
(a, v, pva) →(b, w, pwb) ,
(b, w, qwb) →(a, v, qva)
the joint probabilities of the two outcomes are the same,
pva pwb = qwbqva.
(14.30)
Consequently,
P [a = v in trial 1] = P [a = v in trial 2]
(14.31)
and
P [b = w in trial 1] = P [b = w in trial 2] .
(14.32)
(See [262] for the proof.)
To clearly understand what is being stated, recall that pwb is the conditional
probability of observing the value w of b given that before this the outcome was the
value v of a. So, the product of pva pwb is the overall probability of the ﬁrst of the
two sequences in the proposition. The value of qwbqva is understood analogously.
Equation (14.30) therefore states that
P [a = v in trial 1 and b = w in trial 2] = P [b = w in trial 1 and a = v in trial 2] .
Equations (14.30)–(14.32) are empirically testable predictions. Moreover, if we
assume that the questions like “Is Clinton honest” and “Is Gore honest” fall within
the scope of RRE (and it would be amazing if they did not), these predictions are
known to be de facto falsiﬁed.

14.5 Measurement Sequences a →b →a

Property 3 (QOE+RRE).
Within a nonempty subclass of questions for which (RRE) holds (and for the same
set of inter-trial intervals), the joint probability of two successive responses depends
on the order in which the questions were posed.
This is question order effect in combination with “response replicability effect
(QOE + RRE, Chaps. 1, 9 and 10). We recall that QOE has in fact been presented
as one for whose understanding QM is especially useful: the empirical ﬁnding that
pva pwb ̸= qwbqva is explained in Ref. [452] by assuming that the operators A and
B representing the observables a and b do not commute. In the survey reported by
Moore [359], about 1,000 people were asked two questions, one half of them in one
order, the other half in another. The probability estimates are presented for four pairs
of questions: the ﬁrst pair was about the honesty of Bill Clinton (a) and Al Gore (b),
the second about the honesty of Newt Gingrich (a) and Bob Dole (b), etc.

The results are presented in the form of P [a = 1 in trial i] and P [b = 1 in trial i],
i = 1, 2, so the tested predictions are (14.31) and (14.32). As we can see, for all
question pairs, the probability estimates of Yes to the same question differ depending
on whether the question was asked ﬁrst or second. Given the sample size (about 500
respondents per question pair in a given order) the differences are not attributable to
chance variation.
Properties 1, 2, and 3 turn out to be incompatible within the framework of the von
Neumann part of quantum measurement theory (observables as Hermitian operators
and state updates as projections). We should conclude therefore that QM cannot
be applied to the questions that have these properties without modiﬁcations. These
modiﬁcations have been done in the framework of the theory of quantum instruments
[369, 370] (Chaps. 9 and 10).
We remark that when paper [262] was written its authors were not sure that
aforementioned modiﬁcations are possible at all. This paper contained a discussion
on the (im)possibility to proceed with POVMs, but it suffers of mathematically non-
rigorous considerations. The next paper in this direction [49] only increased doubts
in possibility to describe QOE+RRE within QM: atomic quantum instruments (those
most widely used in quantum information theory) neither work. So, the situation,
before publication of article [369], was really critical for quantum-like modeling in
cognition and psychology.

Chapter 15
Probabilistic Structure of Cognition:
May Be Even Worse than Quantum?
15.1
Comparing Foundations of Quantum Physics
and Cognition
In this chapter, we follow the article of Basieva and Khrennikov [50].
QP calculus relaxes a few important classical probabilistic constraints. For exam-
ple, one of the basic laws of classical probability theory, the formula of total prob-
ability (FTP) can be violated (Chap. 1). In physical terms violation of FTP for
quantum observables is represented as interference of probabilities [231, 232, 251].
As was found by Khrennikov [254, 264], FTP is violated as well for statistical data
collected in experimental research in cognitive psychology. Busemeyer et al. [87]
found coupling of the violation of FTP with the disjunction effect in psychology.
In principle, there are no reasons to expect that quantum probability matches
perfectly cognition. Yes, now we are sure that cognition cannot be represented with
the aid of classical probability (Kolmogorov’s set-theoretic axiomatics, 1933), e.g.,
because FTP is violated. However, it may happen that quantum probability, although
so successful for modeling of some features of cognition, cannot cover completely
cognitive phenomena. There might be some effects which (probabilistically) are
neitherclassicalnorquantum.Therearenoreasonstoexpectthatquantumprobability
would cover all statistical experiments with micro-systems.
Recently one of the world’s best experimental groups working in quantum foun-
dations, the group of prof. Weihs from Innsbruck, put tremendous efforts to ﬁnd
violations of the basic rule of quantum probability theory, the Born rule, by testing
Sorkin’s equality [417], see [413, 414].1
1 Another model leading to violation of this rule was proposed in the framework of so-called
prequantum classical statistical ﬁeld theory (PCSFT) [263]. In PCSFT, Born’s rule is perturbed,
quantum probability is deﬁned as p(x) = |ψ(x)|2 + α|ψ(x)|4, α << 1. Some experimental design
to check this modiﬁcation of Born’s rule was proposed [263] (but it has not yet been performed).
We remark that, in contrast to Sorkin’s formal probabilistic reasoning, the PCSFT-modiﬁcation of
Born’s is based on physical (classical random ﬁeld) argument. Thus, in some sense, this model is

Probabilistic Structure of Cognition: May Be Even Worse than Quantum?
One can design a simple test of its validity (based on the work of R. Sorkin [417])
in the form of the triple-slit experiment. This is really surprising, because the two-
slit experiment is one of the most fundamental experiments conﬁrming quantum
probability calculus, see Feynman et al. [149]. It was done by numerous research
groups for a variety of quantum systems. And by adding just one slit it is possible
to check the validity of quantum theory. Unfortunately, simplicity on the theoretical
level confronts extreme complexity on the experimental level. Preliminary it was
announced that in the triple-slit experiment violation of Born’s rule was not found.2
Now a few words about the test. Sorkin found [417] that, although quantum
probabilities violate FTP (or in other terms—additivity of probability), they satisfy
some equality for disjunction of three “quantum events”. In the experiment with slits,
the terms of this equality correspond to the following experimental contexts: C123—
all three slits are open, Ci j, i ̸= j,—only slits (i, j) are open, and Ci—only ith slit is
open. Quantum theory predicts that statistical data collected for these (incompatible)
experimental contexts has to satisfy Sorkin’s equality. If its violation was found,
it would mean that from the probabilistic viewpoint quantum theory is even more
exotic. There also exist Sorkin’s equalities of higher orders. And Weihs’ group also
works to check the ﬁfth-order interference (the talk of Gregor Weihs at Växjö-14, 15
conferences). Sorkin’s equality corresponding to the n-slit experiment will be called
Sorkin’s n-equality.
This triple-slit test on the probabilistic structure of data can be designed for cog-
nitive experiments.
Both Sorkin [417] and Weihs et al. [413, 414] worked with wave functions and,
although the output of their calculations is correct, some additional efforts have to
be put in the rigorous mathematical presentation. The latter is based on theory of
quantum conditional probabilities, and it will be done in Sect. 15.3.
15.2
Abstract Presentation for Sorkin’s Equality
In classical measure-theoretic framework, for two disjoint events A1 and A2 and an
event B we have
p(B ∧(A1 ∨A2) = p(B ∧A1) + p(B ∧A2).
(15.1)
This is the basic feature of classical probability, its additivity. As was pointed out
by Feynman, quantum probability is not additive [149]. Formally, this is correct.
However, one has to be careful in deﬁning the probability of conjunction of “quantum
events”, because they can be incompatible. It seems that the only way to deﬁne
moreinterestingfromthephysicalviewpoint.Ontheotherhand,theabstractprobabilisticrealization
serves perfectly to our present aim—applications outside of physics.
2 However, it is not easy to estimate correctly the impact of such technicalities as nonlinearity of
photo-detectors and experiments (struggling with nonlinearity of detectors) are continued.

15.2 Abstract Presentation for Sorkin’s Equality
253
rigorously such probability is to use quantum conditional probability which is well
deﬁned. Thus we want to explore a quantum analog of the classical equality (see
Chap. 1):
p(B ∧A) = p(A)p(B|A).
(15.2)
This equality is a consequence of Bayes’ formula
p(B|A) = p(B ∧A)/p(A).
(15.3)
The latter is the deﬁnition of conditional probability in the Kolmogorov model.
Thus in classical probability we start with well-deﬁned probability of conjunction
of events, the joint probability, and then deﬁne conditional probability. In quantum
probability, we proceed another way around. We shall start with conditional prob-
ability and then deﬁne joint probability. Taking into account the fundamental role
which is played by conditional probability in our further considerations, it is useful
to rewrite equality (15.1), additivity law, in terms of conditional probabilities:
p(B|A1 ∨A2) =
1
p(A1 ∨A2)[p(A1)p(B|A1) + p(A2)p(B|A2)].
(15.4)
This is one of the basic elements of classical statistical inference, the formula of total
probability. In particular, if p(A1 ∨A2) = 1, we get the formula of total probability
in its the most commonly used form:
p(B) = p(A1)p(B|A1) + p(A2)p(B|A2).
(15.5)
Preparing for quantum considerations, let us introduce the “interference term”:
I12 = p(A1 ∨A2)p(B|A1 ∨A2) −p(A1)p(B|A1) −p(A2)p(B|A2)
(15.6)
= p(B ∧(A1 ∨A2)) −p(B ∧A1) −p(B ∧A2).
Inclassicalprobabilitytheory I12 = 0.But,inquantumtheory I12 ̸= 0,seeSect.15.3,
Eq. (15.16).
Now consider three disjoint events Ai, i = 1, 2, 3. Let p(A1 ∨A2 ∨A3) = 1.
Here the additivity law gives us
p(B) = p(B ∧(A1 ∨A2 ∨A2) = p(B ∧A1) + p(B ∧A2) + p(B ∧A3).
(15.7)
And the formula of total probability has the form:
p(B) = p(A1)p(B|A1) + p(A2)p(B|A2) + p(A3)p(B|A3).
(15.8)
We introduce the corresponding “interference coefﬁcient”:

254
15
Probabilistic Structure of Cognition: May Be Even Worse than Quantum?
I123 = p(B) −p(A1)p(B|A1) + p(A2)p(B|A2) + p(A3)p(B|A3)
(15.9)
= p(B) −p(B ∧A1) −p(B ∧A2) + p(B ∧A3).
In classical probability theory I123 = 0.
Since I12 = I13 = I23 = 0, we can write this term as
I123 = p(B) −p(A1)p(B|A1) −p(A2)p(B|A2) −p(A3)p(B|A3)
(15.10)
−I12 −I13 −I23.
Thus
I123 = p(B) −p(A1)p(B|A1) −p(A2)p(B|A2) −p(A3)p(B|A3)
(15.11)
−p(A1 ∨A2)p(B|A1 ∨A2) + p(A1)p(B|A1) + p(A2)p(B|A2) + . . . .
Finally, we obtain the triple-interference coefﬁcient in the following form:
I123 = p(B) −p(A1 ∨A2)p(B|A1 ∨A2) −p(A1 ∨A3)p(B|A1 ∨A3) −p(A2 ∨A3)p(B|A2 ∨A3)
(15.12)
+p(A1)p(B|A1) + p(A2)p(B|A2) + p(A3)p(B|A3).
By using the joint probability distribution and by shortening notation, pi j = p(B ∧
(Ai ∨A j), pi = p(B ∧Ai), we write this coefﬁcient as
I123 = p123 −p12 −p13 −p23 + p1 + p2 + p3.
(15.13)
Of course, in classical probability the expression on the left-hand side also equals
zero.
Surprisingly, in quantum theory the coefﬁcient deﬁned by the left-hand side of
(15.13) also equals zero, in spite non-vanishing (in general) of the second-order
interference terms Ii j. And this was an interesting discovery of Sorkin [417].
We shall prove this in Sect. 15.3 by proceeding in the rigorous framework of
quantum conditional probabilities, see equality (15.15).
In principle, we can proceed with only conditional probabilities, i.e., without
joint probabilities at all. However, Sorkin formulated his equalities in terms of joint
probabilities and we wanted to have similar expressions.
Now we can forget about quantum probabilities and just to check whether some
statistical data satisﬁes Sorkin’s equality
I123 = p123 −p12 −p13 −p23 + p1 + p2 + p3 = 0
(15.14)

or not. If Sorkin’s equality were violated, both classical and quantum models should
be rejected; in the opposite case, we would get another (nontrivial) conﬁrmation of
validity of the quantum model.
In coming experiments, instead of one event B, we shall consider a few disjoint
events B j. We shall use this j as the upper index for probabilities, e.g., p( j)
i .
15.3
Derivation of Sorkin’s Equality
We restrict our consideration to observables a and b represented by Hermitian opera-
tors A and B and with the projection state update due to measurement’s back action.
(As always, we consider the ﬁnite-dimensional case.) We have to assume that the
eigenvalues of the operators can be degenerate, because as was found in [254], it
is impossible to represent some cognitive entities by operators with nondegenerate
spectra.3
Let ai, i = 1, 2, 3, and b j, j = 1, 2, . . . , m, be the eigenvalues of A and B.
Denote the corresponding projectors by Ea
i and Eb
j respectively. We shall also intro-
duce projector Ea
ik, i ̸= k, on subspaces consisting of eigenvectors of A correspond-
ing to eigenvalues αi and αk. Thus
Ea
ik = Ea
i + Ea

Let ρ be a quantum state given by a density operator. Then we have
p(a = ai) ≡p(a = ai|ρ) = TrEa

p(a = ak ∨a = am) ≡p(a = ak ∨a = am|ρ) = TrEa

We also consider sequential joint probability distribution:
pi ≡p(a = ai)p(b = β j|a = ai),
the index j is ﬁxed and we omitted it. For k ̸= m, we consider the two-slit interfer-
ence:

analog of FTP, since joint probabilities are deﬁned via conditional probabilities. R.

15.4 Emigration Experiment
257
15.4
Emigration Experiment
We present a toy model of the cognitive analog of the triple-slit experiment. There
is a homogeneous group of people recruited for the experiment.4 They are informed
that during the experiment they will answer to a few questions related to their possible
emigration to other countries; for this experiment, three ﬁxed countries; for example,
we can select Brazil, Canada, Australia, a = 1, 2, 3.
We tell them the story: “Suppose you would like to emigrate to one of these
countries.” Then this group is divided into three subgroups G, G′ and G′′. People
from the ﬁrst two groups will participate in experiments with conditional questioning
and in the last group in unconditional experiment.
Those from G ﬁrst are asked the a-question: To which of these three countries
would you like to emigrate? Those with the answers a = i form the new groups Gi.
We ﬁnd the probabilities p(a = i) ≈
nGi
nG , where nQ denotes the number of elements
in the set Q.
Then we have to ask those in groups Gi another question, say b, which has to be
“complementary” to the a-question. Selection of b is the delicate issue. For example,
let us proceed with the question b: Are you ready to change your profession? (in
the case of emigration to this country)5 This is the dichotomous observable b = 0, 1
corresponding to the answers ‘no’, ‘yes’. (In principle, we can consider b having
any ﬁnite number of values, but it is enough to ﬁnd violation of Sorkin’s equality
for a dichotomous b-observable.) Those in Gi who answered b = j form the group
denoted by G j|i. Now we can ﬁnd conditional probabilities, p(b = j|a = i) ≈
nG j|i
nGi
and the “ordered joint probabilities” p( j)
i
= p(a = i)p(b = j|a = i) ≈
nG j|i
nG .
People from the group G′ are asked about pairs of countries: Which pair of these
three countries would you select to emigrate? The answers are pairs (k, m). The
groups corresponding to concrete pairs are denoted as G′
km. And we can ﬁnd the prob-
abilities p(a = k ∨a = m) ≈
nG′
km
nG′ . Then we ask those in each group the b-question;
depending on the answer b = j, we form the groups G′
j|km. and ﬁnd the conditional
probabilities p(b = j|a = k ∨a = m) ≈
nG′
j|km
nG′
km . They determine the joint probabil-
ities p( j)
km = p(a = k ∨a = m)p(b = j|a = k ∨a = m) ≈
nG′
j|km
nG′ .
Now those in G′′ are asked just the b-question; depending to the answers we ﬁnd
the probabilities p(b = j) = p( j)
123.
Finally, we put collected probabilities into Sorkin’s equality, to check whether the
interference term I ( j)
123 = 0.
4 Its homogeneity is important, because it will be divided into a few subgroups which will be used to
collect different blocks of statistical data. And it is important that we can assume that the members
of all subgroups have “the same mental state”.
5 Another proposal: Do you think that your application for emigration (to this country) will be
successful?

258
15
Probabilistic Structure of Cognition: May Be Even Worse than Quantum?
Of course, it is useful before to start this “triple-slit experiment”, to check whether
the questions are really complementary, i.e., one has to start with the corresponding
two-slit versions of this experiment to see whether I ( j)
km ̸= 0. (But for this experiment
a new group of people has to be used.)
15.5
Triple-Store Experiment in Economics
The experimental test described in Sect. 15.4 has not yet been performed. However, it
stimulated a similar experiment. In paper [391], there was reported on an economics
experiment based on a triple-slit experiment design, where the slits are menus of
alternatives from which one can choose. The test of nonclassicality is based on the
Sorkin equality (which was only recently tested in quantum physics). Each alternative
is a voucher to buy products in one or more stores. The alternatives are obtained from
all disjunctions including one, two, or three stores. The participants have to reveal
the amount for which they are willing to sell the chosen voucher. Interference terms
are computed by comparing the willingness to sell a voucher built as a disjunction
of stores and the willingness to sell the vouchers corresponding to the singleton
stores. These willingness to sell amounts are used to estimate probabilities and to test
both the law of total probabilities and the Born rule. Results reject neither classical
nor quantum probability. The authors of article [391] analyzed the output of this
initial experiment and provided guidelines for future studies which might lead to
new experiments directed to check the validity of Sorkin’s equality, in cognition or
economics.

Part VI
Foundations and Mathematics
We postponed to this part the introduction to the mathematical formalism and foun-
dational question of quantum theory. Some portions of the quantum formalism were
delivered in Sects. 2.1, 4.3, 4.4. Now we present this formalism more consistently
(Chap. 16). Quantum foundations have not yet been ﬁrmly established and they are
characterized by the diversity of approaches and interpretations. We did not want to
start with the foundational problems and to show the reader that the beautiful and
powerful quantum theory has really shaky foundational grounds. We want to sell
this theory to the researchers modeling cognition, psychology, and decision-making
as well as the general behavior of biosystems. So, it was reasonable to devote the
main body of the book to the demonstration of the advantages of quantum theory.
But now it is time to discuss quantum foundations (Chap. 17). The main attention is
paid to Bohr’s and Bell’s views on the quantum foundations, incompatibility versus
nonlocality.
In Chap. 18 quantum statistics is derived on the basis of indistinguishability. This
coupling was discussed in many places of this book, and ﬁnally, it is rigorously
described.

Chapter 16
Formalism of Quantum Theory
16.1
Mathematical Structure of Quantum Theory
Complex Hilbert Space
In this book we consider only ﬁnite dimensional linear spaces. Hilbert space H is a
complex linear space endowed with a scalar product ⟨·|·⟩.
The scalar product is a function from the Cartesian product H × H to the ﬁeld
of complex numbers C, ψ1, ψ2 →⟨ψ1|ψ2⟩, having the following properties:
1. Positive-deﬁniteness: ⟨ψ|ψ⟩≥0 with ⟨ψ, ψ⟩= 0 if and only if ψ = 0.
2. Conjugate symmetry: ⟨ψ1|ψ2⟩= ⟨ψ2|ψ1⟩
3. Linearity with respect to the second argument1: ⟨φ|k1ψ1 + k2ψ2⟩= k1⟨φ|ψ1⟩+
k2⟨φ|ψ2⟩, where k1, k2 are complex numbers.
Any scalar product generates the norm on H:
∥ψ∥=

⟨ψ|ψ⟩.
Hermitian Operators, Projectors
We also recall a few basic notions of theory of linear operators in complex Hilbert
space. A map A : H →H is called a linear operator, if it maps linear combination
of vectors into linear combination of their images:
A(λ1ψ1 + λ2ψ2) = λ1Aψ1 + λ2 Aψ2,
where λ j ∈C, ψ j ∈H, j = 1, 2.
1 In mathematical texts one typically considers linearity with respect to the ﬁrst argument. Thus a
mathematician has to pay attention to this difference.

Formalism of Quantum Theory
For a linear operator A the symbol A∗denotes its adjoint operator which is deﬁned
by the equality
⟨Aψ1|ψ2⟩= ⟨ψ1|A∗ψ2⟩.
(16.1)
Let us select in H some orthonormal basis (ei), i.e., ⟨ei|e j⟩= δi j. By denoting the
matrix elements of the operators A and A∗as ai j and a∗
i j, respectively, we rewrite
the deﬁnition (16.1) in terms of the matrix elements:
a∗
i j = ¯a ji.
A linear operator A is called Hermitian if it coincides with its adjoint operator:
A = A⋆.
If an orthonormal basis in H is ﬁxed, (ei), and A is represented by its matrix,
A = (ai j), where ai j = ⟨Aei|e j⟩, then it is Hermitian if and only if
¯ai j = a ji.
We remark that, for a Hermitian operator, all its eigenvalues are real. In fact,
this was one of the main reasons to represent quantum observables by Hermitian
operators. In quantum formalism, the spectrum of a linear operator (the set of eigen-
values while we are in the ﬁnite dimensional case) coincides with the set of possibly
observable values (Sect. 16.2, Postulate 3).
Eigenvectors of Hermitian operators corresponding to different eigenvalues are
orthogonal. This property of Hermitian operators plays some role in justiﬁcation of
the projection postulate of QM, see Sect. 16.3.
A linear operator A is positive-semideﬁnite if, for any φ ∈H,
⟨Aφ|φ⟩≥0.
This is equivalent to positive-semideﬁniteness of its matrix.
For a linear operator A, its trace is deﬁned as the sum of diagonal elements of its
matrix in any orthonormal basis:
Tr A =

i
aii =

i
⟨Aei|ei⟩,
i.e., this quantity does not depend on a basis.
Let L be a subspace of H. The orthogonal projector E : H →L onto this sub-
space is a Hermitian, idempotent (i.e., coinciding with its square) and positive-
semideﬁnite operator:
1. E∗= E;
2. E2 = E;
3. E ≥0.

16.1 Mathematical Structure of Quantum Theory
263
Here (3) is a consequence of (1) and (2). Moreover, an arbitrary linear operator
satisfying (1) and (2) is an orthogonal projector - onto the subspace HE ≡EH.
Pure Quantum States
Pure quantum states (Sect. 16.2) are mathematically represented by normalized
vectors, ψ ∈H : ∥ψ∥= 1. Two colinear vectors,
ψ′ = λψ, λ ∈C, |λ| = 1,
(16.2)
represent the same pure state.
Thus, rigorously speaking, a pure state is an equivalence class of vectors having
the unit norm: ψ′ ∼ψ for vectors coupled by (16.2).
The unit sphere of H is split into disjoint classes - pure states. However, in concrete
calculations one typically uses just concrete representatives of equivalent classes, i.e.,
one works with normalized vectors.
Each pure state can also be represented as the projection operator Eψ which
projects H onto one dimensional subspace based on ψ. For a vector φ ∈H,
Eψφ = ⟨ψ|φ⟩ψ.
(16.3)
The trace of the one dimensional projector Eψ equals 1:
Tr Eψ = ⟨ψ|ψ⟩= 1.
We summarize the properties of the operator Eψ representing the pure state ψ.
It is
1. Hermitian,
2. positive-semideﬁnite,
3. trace one,
4. idempotent.
Moreover, any operator satisfying (1)–(4) represents a pure state. Properties (1) and
(4) characterize orthogonal projectors, property (2) is their consequence. Property
(3) implies that the projector is one dimensional.
Mixed Quantum States
The next step in the development of QM was the extension of the class of quantum
states, from pure states represented by one dimensional projectors to states repre-
sented by linear operators having the properties (1)–(3). Such operators are called
density operators. (This nontrivial step of extension of the class of quantum states
was based on the efforts of Landau and von Neumann.) The symbol D(H) denotes
the space of density operators in the complex Hilbert space H.
One typically distinguish pure states, as represented by one dimensional projec-
tors, and mixed states, the density operators which cannot be represented by one
dimensional projectors. The terminology “mixed” has the following origin: any den-
sity operator can be represented as a “mixture” of pure states (ψi):

264
16
Formalism of Quantum Theory
ρ =

i
pi Eψi, pi ∈[0, 1],

i
pi = 1.
(16.4)
The state is pure if and only if such a mixture is trivial: all pi, besides one, equal
zero. However, by operating with the terminology “mixed state” one has to take into
account that the representation in the form (16.4) is not unique. The same mixed
state can be presented as mixtures of different collections of pure states.
Any operator ρ satisfying (1)–(3) is diagonalizable (even in inﬁnite-dimensional
Hilbert space), i.e., in some orthonormal basis it is represented as a diagonal matrix,
ρ = diag(pj), where p j ∈[0, 1], 
j p j = 1.
Thus it can be represented in the form (16.4) with mutually orthogonal one dimen-
sional projectors. The property (4) can be used to check whether a state is pure or not.
We point out that pure states are merely mathematical abstractions; in real experi-
mental situations it is possible to prepare only mixed states.
16.2
Quantum Mechanics as Axiomatic Theory
We state again that H denotes complex Hilbert space with the scalar product ⟨·|·⟩
and the norm ∥· ∥corresponding to the scalar product.
Postulate 1. (The mathematical description of quantum states). Quantum pure states
(wave functions) are represented by normalized vectors ψ (i.e., ∥ψ∥2 = ⟨ψ|ψ⟩= 1)
of H. Every normalized vector ψ ∈H may represent a quantum state. If a vector ψ
corresponding to a state is multiplied by any complex number c, |c| = 1, the resulting
vector will correspond to the same state.
Postulate 2. (The mathematical description of observables). Observable a is repre-
sented by a Hermitian operator A in H. Different observables are represented by
different operators.
Postulate 3. (Spectral) For observable a with Hermitian operator A, one can predict
(together with some probabilities) values λ ∈Spec(A).
The symbol Spec(A) denotes spectrum of operator A. Since we consider the ﬁnite
dimensional case, this is just the set of eigenvalues. Here Hermitian operator A can
be represented as
A = α1E(α1) + · · · + αm E(αm), αm ∈Spec(A) ⊂R,
(16.5)
where E(α) denotes projection on the subspace of eigenvectors corresponding to the
eigenvalue α.
Postulate 4. (Born’s rule) For observable a with Hermitian operator A, probability
P(a = αm|ψ) to obtain the eigenvalue αm of A for measurement of a in a state ψ is
given by the following rule

16.2 Quantum Mechanics as Axiomatic Theory
265
P(a = αm|ψ) = ∥E(αm)ψ∥2.
(16.6)
If the operator A has nondegenerate spectrum, then each αm is associated with one
dimensional subspace. The latter can be ﬁxed by selecting any normalized vector,
say ea
m. In this case projectors act simply as
E(αm)ψ = ⟨ea
m|ψ⟩ea
m.
(16.7)
The formula (16.6) takes a very simple form
P(a = αm|ψ) = |⟨ea
m|ψ⟩|2.
(16.8)
This is Born’s rule in the Hilbert space formalism.
To obtain original Born’s rule, one should choose H as the L2-space of square
integrable functions, ψ : R →C, with scalar product:
⟨ψ|φ⟩=

ψ(x)φ(x)dx.
(We consider one dimensional particle). The position observable x is represented by
the multiplication operator X
X(ψ)(x) = xψ(x).
(16.9)
This operator has continuous spectrum. It coincides with the whole real line. So, this
operator is unbounded. Its eigenvectors do not belong to the L2-space. They are given
by Dirac’s δ-functions, i.e., these are generalized eigenfunctions, see Dirac [125]
X(eα)(x) = αeα(x)|α ∈R,
(16.10)
where eα(x) = δ(x −α). One can reasonably deﬁne paring:
⟨eα|ψ⟩= ψ(α).
(16.11)
Then the rule (16.8) gives
P(x = α|ψ) = |ψ(α)|2 = |⟨eα|ψ⟩|2.
(16.12)
By using the Born’s rule (16.6 ) and the classical probabilistic deﬁnition of average
(Sect. 16.4), it is easy to see that the average value of the observable a in the state ψ
is given by
⟨a⟩ψ =

m
αm P(a = αm|ψ) =

m
αm∥E(αm)ψ∥2 = ⟨A ψ|ψ⟩.
(16.13)

266
16
Formalism of Quantum Theory
In physics one often denotes the scalar product ⟨Aψ|ψ⟩by the symbol ⟨ψ|A|ψ⟩. We
shall use both.
Postulate 5. (Pure quantum state dynamics). Let H be the Hamiltonian of a quan-
tum system, i.e., the Hermitian operator corresponding to the energy observable. The
time evolution of the wave function ψ ∈H is described by the Schödinger equation
i d
dt ψ(t) = Hψ(t)
(16.14)
with the initial condition ψ(0) = ψ.
16.3
Projection Postulate: Von Neumann Versus Lüders
Forms
Consider pure state ψ and quantum observable (Hermitian operator) A representing
some physical observable a.
Suppose ﬁrst that A has nondegenerate spectrum; denote its eigenvalues by
α1, .., αm and the corresponding eigenvectors by ea
1, . . . , ea
m. Here αi ̸= α j, i ̸= j.
This is an orthonormal basis in H.
We expand the vector ψ with respect to this basis:
ψ = k1ea
1 + · · · + kmea
m,
(16.15)
where (k j) are complex numbers such that
∥ψ∥2 = |k1|2 + · · · + |km|2 = 1.
(16.16)
By using the terminology of linear algebra we say that the pure state ψ is a
superposition of the pure states e j. The von Neumann projection postulate describes
the post-measurement state and it can be formulated as follows:
Postulate 6VN. [451] (Projection postulate, von Neumann). Let observable a be
represented by Hermitian operator A with nondegenerate spectrum. Measurement
of a resulting in the output αi induces reduction of superposition (16.15) to the basis
vector ea
i .
The procedure described by the projection postulate can be interpreted in the
following way:
Superposition (16.15) reﬂects uncertainty in the results of measurements for
an observable a. Before measurement a quantum system “does not know how it
will answer to the question a.” The Born’s rule presents potentialities for differ-
ent answers. Thus a quantum system in the superposition state ψ does not have
propensity to any value of a as its objective property. After the measurement the

16.4 Classical Probability: Kolmogorov Axiomatics
267
superposition is reduced to the single term in the expansion (16.15) corresponding
to the value of a obtained in the process of measurement.
Consider now an arbitrary quantum observable a represented by Hermitian oper-
ator A,
A = α1E(α1) + · · · + αm E(αm).
The Lüders projection postulate describing the post-measurement state is formulated
as follows:
Postulate 6L. [341] (Projection postulate, Lüders). Measurement of observable
a resulting in the output αm induces projection of state ψ on state
ψαm =
E(αm)ψ
∥E(αm)ψ∥.
We emphasize that von Neumann formulated Postulate 6VN only for observables
with nondegenerate spectra. Lüders generalized the von Neumann’s postulate to the
case of observables with degenerate spectra. This fact is not so widely known, even
for experts in quantum foundations. Von Neumann [451] reasoned that generally the
post-measurement state is not given by projection on the corresponding eigensub-
space. The state update procedure is more complicated, later it was formalized within
theory of quantum instruments .
16.4
Classical Probability: Kolmogorov Axiomatics
The Kolmogorov probability space [318] is any triple
(	, F , P),
where 	 is a set of any origin and F is a σ-algebra of its subsets, P is a probability
measure on F .
The set 	 represents random parameters of the model. Kolmogorov called ele-
ments of 	 elementary events. This terminology is standard in mathematical litera-
ture. Sets of elementary events are regarded as events.
The key point of Kolmogorov’s axiomatization of probability theory is that not
any subset of 	 can be treated as an event. For any stochastic model, the system of
events F is selected from the very beginning.
The key mathematical point is that F has to be a σ-algebra. (Otherwise it would
be very difﬁcult to develop a proper notion of integral. And the latter is needed to
deﬁne average of a random variable.)
We remind that a σ-algebra is a system of sets which contains 	 and empty set,
it is closed with respect to the operations of countable union and intersection and to
the operation of taking the complement of a set. For example, the collection of all

268
16
Formalism of Quantum Theory
subsets of 	 is a σ-algebra. This σ-algebra is used in the case of ﬁnite or countable
sets:
	 = {ω1, . . . , ωn, . . .}.
(16.17)
However, for “continuous sets”, e.g., 	 = [a, b] ⊂R, the collection of all possi-
ble subsets is too large to have applications. Typically it is impossible to describe a
σ-algebra in the direct terms. To deﬁne a σ-algebra, one starts with a simple system
of subsets of 	 and then consider the σ-algebra which is generated from this sim-
ple system with the aid of aforementioned operations. In particular, one of the most
important for applications σ-algebras, the so called Borel σ-algebra, is constructed
in this way by staring with the system consisting of all open and closed intervals of
the real line. In a metric space (in particular, in a Hilbert space), the Borel σ-algebra
is constructed by starting with the system of all open and closed balls.
Finally, we remark that in American literature the term σ-ﬁeld is typically used,
instead of σ-algebra.
The probability is deﬁned as a measure, i.e., a map from F to nonnegative real
numbers which is σ-additive:
P(∪j A j) =

j
P(A j),
(16.18)
where A j ∈F and Ai ∩A j = ∅, i ̸= j. The probability measure is always normal-
ized by one:
P(	) = 1.
(16.19)
In the case of a discrete probability space, see (16.17), the probability measures
have the form
P(A) =

ω j∈A
p j, p j = P({ω j}).
A (real) random variable is a map ξ : 	 →R which is measurable with respect
to the Borel σ-algebra B of R and the σ-algebra F of 	, i.e., for any  ∈B,
ξ −1() ∈F . We recall that B is the minimal σ-algebra containing all open subsets
of R (or equivalently all intervals (α, β)).
The probability distribution of a random variable ξ is deﬁned as
pξ() = P(ξ −1()) = P(ω ∈	 : ξ(ω) ∈).
The mean value (average) of a random variable is deﬁned as
E[ξ] =

	
ξ(ω)d P(ω) =
 +∞
−∞
xdpξ(x).
(16.20)
In this paper we consider mainly random variables with the discrete range of values.
For a discrete random variable ξ and its value x, we set

16.5 Quantum Conditional Probability
269
	ξ
x = {ω ∈	 : ξ(ω) = x}
and the probability distribution is given by pξ(x) = P(	ξ
x). The mean value has the
simple representation:
E[ξ] =

j
α j pξ(α j).
(16.21)
In the Kolmogorov model the conditional probability is deﬁned by the Bayes formula
P(B|A) = P(B ∩A)
P(A)
, P(A) > 0.
(16.22)
We stress that other axioms are independent of this deﬁnition.
We also present the formula of total probability (FTP) which is a simple conse-
quence of the Bayes formula. Consider the pair, a and b, of discrete random variables.
Then
P(b = β) =

α
P(a = α)P(b = β|a = α).
(16.23)
Thus the b-probability distribution can be calculated from the a-probability distri-
bution and the conditional probabilities P(b = β|a = α). These conditional proba-
bilities are also known as transition probabilities.
16.5
Quantum Conditional Probability
In the classical Kolmogorov probabilistic model (Sect. 16.4), besides probabilities
one operates with the conditional probabilities deﬁned by the Bayes formula (see
Sect. 16.4, formula (16.22)). The Born’s postulate deﬁning quantum probability
should also be completed by a deﬁnition of the conditional probability. We have
remarked that, for one concrete observable, the probability given by Born’s rule can
be treated classically. However, the deﬁnition of the conditional probability involves
two observables. Such situations cannot be treated classically. Thus conditional prob-
ability is really a quantum probability.
Let observables a and b be represented by Hermitian operators A and B with
spectral decompositions
A =

m
αm Ea(αm), B =

m
βm Eb(βm)
(16.24)
Let ψ be a pure state and let E(αm)ψ ̸= 0. Then the probability to get the value
b = βm under the condition that the value a = αk was observed in the preceding
measurement of the observable a on the state ψ is given by the formula

270
16
Formalism of Quantum Theory
P(b = βm|a = αk; ψ) ≡∥Eb(βm) Ea(αk)ψ∥2
∥Ea(αk) ψ∥2
(16.25)
One can motivate this deﬁnition by appealing to the projection postulate (Lüders’
version). After the a-measurement with output a = αk initially prepared state ψ is
projected onto the state
ψαk =
Ea(αk)ψ
∥Ea(αk) ψ∥.
Then one applies the Born rule to the b-measurement for this state. Thus, quantum
conditional probability is based on the operation of the state update resulting from
observation and the calculus of quantum conditional probabilities is a “probabilistic
shadow” of the calculus of quantum states.
Let the operator A have nondegenerate spectrum, i.e., for any eigenvalue α the
corresponding eigenspace is one dimensional. Then
P(b = βm|a = αk; ψ) = ∥Eb(βm)ea
k∥2
(16.26)
(here Aea
k = αkea
k). Thus, in this case the conditional probability does not depend
on the original state ψ. We can say that the memory about the original state was
destroyed. If also the operator B has nondegenerate spectrum then we have:
P(b = βm|a = αk; ψ) = |⟨eb
m|ea
k⟩|2
and
P(a = αk|b = βm; ψ) = |⟨ea
k|eb
m⟩|2.
Symmetry of the scalar product implies the following important result:
Let both operators A and B have purely discrete nondegenerate spectra and let
Ekaψ ̸= 0 and Embψ ̸= 0. Then conditional probability is symmetric and it does
not depend on the original state ψ:
P(b = βm|a = αk; ψ) = P(a = αk|b = βm; ψ) = |⟨eb
m|ea
k⟩|2.
(16.27)
So,thestate-labelcanbeomittedandwecansimplywrite P(b = βm|a = αk), P(a =
αk|b = βm).
We remark that, classical (Kolmogorov-Bayes) conditional probability is not sym-
metric, besides very special situations. Thus QM is described by a very speciﬁc
probabilistic model.
Consider two nondegenerate observables. Set pβ|α = P(b = β|a = α). The
matrix of transition probabilities Pb|a = (pβ|α) is not only stochastic, i.e.,

β
pβ|α = 1

but it is even doubly stochastic.:

α
pβ|α =

α
|⟨eb
β|ea
α⟩|2 = ⟨eb
β|eb
β⟩= 1.
In Kolmogorov’s model, stochasticity is the general property of matrices of transition
probabilities. However, in general classical matrices of transition probabilities are not
doubly stochastic. Hence, double stochasticity is a very speciﬁc property of quantum
probability.
We remark [254] that statistical data collected outside quantum physics, e.g., in
decision-making by humans and psychology, violates the quantum law of double
stochasticity. Such data cannot be mathematically represented with the aid of Her-
mitian operators with nondegenerate spectra. One has to consider either Hermitian
operators with degenerate spectra or positive operator valued measures (POVMs).
16.6
Derivation of Interference of Probabilities
Let H2 = C × C be the two dimensional complex Hilbert space and let ψ ∈H2 be
a quantum state. Let us consider two dichotomous observables b = β1, β2 and a =
α1, α2 represented by Hermitian operators B and A, respectively (one may consider
simply Hermitian matrices). Let eb = {eb
β} and ea = {ea
α} be two orthonormal bases
consisting of eigenvectors of the operators. The state ψ can be represented in the two
ways
ψ = c1ea
1 + c2ea
2, cα = ⟨ψ|ea
α⟩;
(16.28)
ψ = d1eb
1 + d2eb
2, dβ = ⟨ψ|eb
β⟩.
(16.29)
By Postulate 4 we have
P(a = α) ≡P(a = α|ψ) = |cα|2.
(16.30)
P(b = β) ≡P(b = β|ψ) = |dβ|2.
(16.31)
The possibility to expand one basis with respect to another basis induces connection
between the probabilities P(a = α) and P(b = β). Let us expand the vectors ea
α
with respect to the basis eb
ea
1 = u11eb
1 + u12eb
2
(16.32)
ea
2 = u21eb
1 + u22eb
2
(16.33)
where uαβ = ⟨ea
α, eb
β⟩. Thus d1 = c1u11 + c2u21, d2 = c1u12 + c1u22. We obtain the
quantum rule for transformation of probabilities:

272
16
Formalism of Quantum Theory
P(b = β) = |c1u1β + c2u2β|2.
(16.34)
On the other hand, by the deﬁnition of quantum conditional probability, see (16.25),
we obtain:
P(b = β|a = α) = |⟨ea
α|eb
β⟩|2.
(16.35)
By combining (16.30), (16.31) and (16.34), (16.35) we obtain the quantum for-
mula of total probability – the formula of the interference of probabilities:
P(b = β) =

α
P(a = α)P(b = β|a = α)
(16.36)
+2 cos θ

P(a = α1)P(b = β|a = α1)P(a = α2)P(b = β|a = α2)
In general cos θ ̸= 0. Thus the quantum FTP does not coincide with the classical
FTP (16.23) which is based on the Bayes’ formula.
16.7
Compatible Versus Incompatible Observables
In quantum physics, observables a and b are called compatible if they can be jointly
measurable and the joint probability distribution (JPD) P(a = x1, b = x2|ψ) is well
deﬁned; observables which cannot be jointly measurable and, hence, their JPD can-
not be deﬁned are called incompatible. In the mathematical formalism, compatibility
and incompatibility are formalized through commutativity and noncommutativity,
respectively. If observables are described as Hermitian operators A and B, compat-
ibility is encoded as commutativity of operators,
[A, B] = 0;
(16.37)
if they are observables given by PVMs a = (Ea(x1)) and b = (Eb(x2)), then com-
patibility is mathematically formalized as
[Ea(x1), Eb(x2)] = 0;
(16.38)
for all x1 ∈Xa, x2 ∈Xb, where Xa and Xb are the ranges of values of these observ-
ables. Incompatibility of observables given by Hermitian operators A and B is
described the noncommutativity condition [A, B] ̸= 0 or, for POV-observables, as
violation of (16.38) at least for one pair (x1, x2). For compatible observables, JPD is
given by the following extension of the Born’s rule:
P(a = x1, b = x2|ψ) = ∥Ea(x1)Eb(x2)ψ∥2 = ∥Eb(x2)Ea(x1)ψ∥2.
(16.39)

16.8 Quantum Logic
273
By using JPD compatible observables can be modeled in the classical probabilistic
formalism.
The formula (16.39) can be generalized for an arbitrary number of compatible
observables a1, . . . , am as
P(a1 = x1 . . . am = xm|ψ) = ∥Ea1(x1) . . . Eamb(xm)ψ∥2
(16.40)
and this expression is invariant w.r.t. permutations of observables.
We point out that compatibility of quantum observables is identical to pairwise
compatibility, if observables are pairwise compatible, i.e., each pair of them is jointly
measurable and JPD for each pair ai, a j is well deﬁned, then they are jointly measur-
able and their JPD is well deﬁned by formula (16.40). This is the speciﬁc property
of quantum observables. Generally there are no reasons to expect that pairwise mea-
surement should imply joint measurement of the vector of observables a1, . . . , am
or in the probabilistic terms - the existence of the pairwise JPD would imply the
existence of JPD for this vector.
We now make the following remark on quantum conditional probability for com-
patible observables, by combining formulas (16.25) and (16.39), we obtain:
P(b = βm|a = αk; ψ) = P(a = x1, b = x2|ψ)
P(a = x1|ψ)
,
(16.41)
hence the classical Bayes formula for conditional probability (16.22) is recovered.
Thus, for compatible observables, the calculus of conditional probabilities coincides
with the classical one.
We stress that compatibility vs. incompatibility are coupled to joint measurabil-
ity vs. non-measurability; in probabilistic terms: existence vs. nonexistence of JPD;
in operator terms: commutativity vs. noncommutativity. The latter algebraic char-
acterization is often coupled straightforwardly with the order effect: measurement
of observable a and then b generates statistics which differs from statistics in mea-
surement of observable b and then b. In fact, this is the misleading interpretation of
noncommutativity of operators.
16.8
Quantum Logic
Birkhoff and von Neumann [69] suggested to represent events (propositions) by
orthogonal projectors in complex Hilbert space H.
For an orthogonal projector E, we set HE = EH, its image, and vice versa,
for subspace L of H, the corresponding orthogonal projector is denoted by the
symbol EL.
The set of orthogonal projectors is a lattice with the order structure: E ≤Q iff
HE ⊂HQ or equivalently, for any ψ ∈H, ⟨ψ|Eψ⟩≤⟨ψ|Qψ⟩.

274
16
Formalism of Quantum Theory
We recall that the lattice of projectors is endowed with operations “and” (∧)
and “or” (∨). For two projectors E1, E2, the projector R = E1 ∧E2 is deﬁned
as the projector onto the subspace HR = HE1 ∩HE2 and the projector S = E1 ∨
E2 is deﬁned as the projector onto the subspace HR deﬁned as the minimal linear
subspace containing the set-theoretic union HE1 ∪HE2 of subspaces HE1, HE2:
this is the space of all linear combinations of vectors belonging these subspaces.
The operation of negation is deﬁned as the orthogonal complement: E⊥= {y ∈H :
⟨y|x⟩= 0 for all x ∈HE}.
In the language of subspaces the operation “and” coincides with the usual set-
theoretic intersection, but the operations “or” and “not” are nontrivial deformations
of the corresponding set-theoretic operations. It is natural to expect that such defor-
mations can induce deviations from classical Boolean logic.
Consider the following simple example. Let H be two dimensional Hilbert space
with the orthonormal basis (e1, e2) and let v = (e1 + e2)/
√
2. Then Ev ∧Ee1 =
0 and Ev ∧Ee2 = 0, but Ev ∧(Ee1 ∨Ee2) = Ev. Hence, for quantum events, in
general the distributivity law is violated:
E ∧(E1 ∨E2) ̸= (E ∧E1) ∨(E ∧E2)
(16.42)
The lattice of orthogonal projectors is called quantum logic. It is considered as a
(very special) generalization of classical Boolean logic.2 Any sub-lattice consisting
of commuting projectors can be treated as classical Boolean logic.
16.9
Tensor Product
Consider two arbitrary (ﬁnite) dimensional Hilbert spaces, H1, H2. For each pair of
vectors
ψ ∈H1, φ ∈H2,
form a new formal entity denoted by ψ ⊗φ. Then consider the sums
 =

i
ψi ⊗φi.
On the set of such formal sums we can introduce the linear space structure. This
is the tensor product H = H1 ⊗H2. In particular, if we take orthonormal bases in
Hk, (e(k)
j ), k = 1, 2, then (ei j = e(1)
i
⊗e(2)
j ) form an orthonormal basis in H, any
 ∈H, can be represented as
 =

ci jei j ≡

ci je(1)
i
⊗e(2)
j ,
(16.43)
2 See article [371] for detailed analysis of the impact of nondistributivity of quantum logic for
cognition and decision-making.

16.9 Tensor Product
275
We also introduce the notion of the tensor product of operators. Consider two
linear operators
Ai : Hi →Hi, i = 1, 2.
Their tensor product
A ≡A1 ⊗A2 : H →H
is deﬁned starting with the tensor products of two vectors:
A ψ ⊗φ = (A1ψ) ⊗(A2φ).
Then it is extended by linearity. By using the coordinate representation (16.43) the
tensor product of operators can be represented as
A  =

ci j Aei j ≡

ci j A1e(1)
i
⊗A2e(2)
j ,
(16.44)
If operators Ai, i = 1, 2, are represented by matrices (a(i)
kl ), with respect to the ﬁxed
bases, then the matrix (akl.nm) of the operator A with respect to the tensor product
of these bases can be easily calculated.
In the same way one deﬁnes the tensor product of Hilbert spaces, H1, . . . , Hn,
denoted by the symbol H = H1 ⊗· · · ⊗Hn. We start with forming the formal enti-
ties
ψ1 ⊗· · · ⊗ψn,
where
ψ j ∈H j, j = 1, . . . , n.
Tensor product space is deﬁned as the set of all sums

j
ψ1 j ⊗· · · ⊗ψnj
(which has to be constrained by some algebraic relations, but we omit such details).
Take orthonormal bases in
Hk, (e(k)
j ), k = 1, . . . , n.
Then any  ∈H can be represented as
 =

α
cαeα ≡

α=( j1... jn)
c j1... jne(1)
j1 ⊗· · · ⊗e(n)
jn .

Symbolism of Ket- and Bra-Vectors
Dirac’s notations [125] are widely used in quantum information theory. Vectors of
Hilbert space H are called ket-vectors, they are denoted as |ψ⟩. The elements of the
dual space H′ of H, the space of linear continuous functionals on H, are called bra-
vectors, they are denoted as ⟨ψ|. Dirac used the expression ⟨ψ|φ⟩for the duality form
between H′ and H, i.e., ⟨ψ|φ⟩is the result of application of the linear functional
fψ ≡⟨ψ| to the vector |φ⟩. In the Hilbert case one can identify H with its dual space
H′ and the duality form with the scalar product.
Consider an observable a given by the Hermitian operator A with nondegenerate
spectrum. Thus, the normalized eigenvectors ei of A form the orthonormal basis in
H (we recall that our considerations are restricted to the case of ﬁnite dimensional
H). Let Aei = αiei. In Dirac’s notation ei is written as |αi⟩and, hence, any pure
state can be written as
|ψ⟩=

i
ci|αi⟩,

i
|ci|2 = 1;
(16.46)
projection onto |αi⟩is written as Eαi = |αi⟩⟨αi|, and it acts formally as Eαi|ψ⟩=
(|αi⟩⟨αi|)|ψ⟩≡⟨αi|ψ⟩|αi⟩, and the operator A is written as
A =

i
αi|αi⟩⟨αi|.
(16.47)
Now consider two Hilbert spaces H1 and H2 and their tensor product H = H1 ⊗
H2. Let (|αi⟩) and (|βi⟩) be orthonormal bases in H1 and H2 corresponding to
the eigenvalues of two observables A and B. Then vectors |αi⟩⊗|β j⟩form the
orthonormal basis in H. Typically in physics the sign of the tensor product is omitted
and these vectors are written as |αi⟩|β j⟩or even as |αiβ j⟩. Thus any vector ψ ∈H =
H1 ⊗H2 can be represented as
ψ =

i j
ci j|αiβ j⟩,
(16.48)
where ci j ∈C.
16.11
Qubit
In quantum information theory typically qubit states (quantum analogs of bits) are
represented with the aid of observables having the eigenvalues 0, 1. Qubit space is
two dimensional, its vectors have the form
|ψ⟩= c0|0⟩+ c1|1⟩, |c0|2 + |c1|2 = 1.
(16.49)

16.12 Entanglement
277
A pair of qubits is represented in the tensor product of single qubit spaces, here pure
states can be represented as superpositions:
|ψ⟩= c00|00⟩+ c01|01⟩+ c10|10⟩+ c11|00⟩.
(16.50)
where 
i j |ci j|2 = 1. In the same way the n-qubit state is represented in the tensor
product of n one-qubit state spaces (it has the dimension 2n):
|ψ⟩=

x j=0,1
cx1...xn|x1 . . . xn⟩,
(16.51)
where

x j=0,1
|cx1...xn|2 = 1.
We remark that the dimension of the n qubit state space grows exponentially with
the growth of n. The natural question about possible physical realizations of such
multI-dimensional state spaces arises. The answer to it is not completely clear; it
depends very much on the used interpretation of the wave function.
16.12
Entanglement
Consider the tensor product
H = H1 ⊗H2 ⊗· · · ⊗Hn
of Hilbert spaces Hk, k = 1, 2, . . . , n. The states of the space H can be separable
and non-separable (entangled). We start by considering pure states. The (pure) states
from the ﬁrst class, separable pure states, can be represented in the form:
|ψ⟩= ⊗n
k=1|ψk⟩= |ψ1 . . . ψn⟩,
(16.52)
where |ψk⟩∈Hk. The states which cannot be represented in this way are called non-
separable, or entangled. Thus mathematically the notion of entanglement is very
simple, it means impossibility of tensor factorization.
For example, let us consider the tensor product of two one-qubit spaces. Select in
each of them an orthonormal basis denoted as |0⟩, |1⟩. The corresponding orthonor-
mal basis in the tensor product has the form
|00⟩, |01⟩, |10⟩, |11⟩.

(16.55)
are entangled. They also form an orthogonal basis in two qubit space.
Entanglement is typically considered as one of the most distinguished features
of quantum information theory. Its interpretation is a difﬁcult foundational prob-
lem. Entanglement is typically coupled to quantum nonlocality and spooky action
at a distance, i.e., to one of quantum exotics. We proceed pragmatically and couple
entanglement to correlations of observables under conditional measurements (see
article [55] for details).
The deﬁnition of entanglement can be generalized to mixed states. A state ρ ∈
D (H1 ⊗H2) is called separable if it can be represented in the form:
ρ =

ckmρ(k)

⊗ρ(m)

(16.56)
where ρ( j)

form is called entangled.

Preliminary Discussion
Forgotten Contribution of Bohr to Contextuality Theory
Contextuality is one of the hottest topics of modern quantum physics, both theo-
retical and experimental. During the recent 20 years, it was discussed in numerous
papers published in top physical journals. Unfortunate of these discussions is that
from the very beginning contextuality (in fact, its special form which we call “join
measurement contextuality”(JMC), Sect.17.13) was coupled to the issue of nonlo-
cality. It was Bell’s intention in his analysis of the possible seeds of the violation of
the Bell type inequalities [61]. Surprisingly, Bell had never mentioned [62] general
contextuality which we call “Bohr contextuality”. The latter has no straightforward
connection to the Bell inequalities; it is coupled to the notion of incompatibility of
observables - the Bohr principle of complementarity. One of the explanations for this
astonishing situation in quantum foundations is that Bohr presented his ideas in a
vague way; moreover, he often changed his vague formulations a few times at dif-
ferent occasions. In this chapter we brieﬂy present Bohr’s ideas about contextuality
of quantum measurements and their role in his formulation of the complementar-
ity principle. Then, we move to the Bell inequalities [60, 62]. This pathway towards
these inequalities (i.e., via Bohr’s contextuality-complementarity) highlights the role
of incompatibility of quantum observables in the Bell framework and gives the possi-
bility to operate with the Bell inequalities without mentioning the ambiguous notion
of quantum nonlocality (spooky action at a distance).

Contextuality, Complementarity, and Bell Tests
What Does Contextuality Mean?
In this situation when so many researchers write and speak about quantum contextu-
ality, one should be sure that this notion is well deﬁned and its physical interpretation
is clear and well known. In fact, before started to think about the meaning of con-
textuality, I was completely sure in this. Strangely enough, I was not able to create a
consistent picture. And I was really shocked when by visiting the institute of Atom
Physics in Vienna and having conversation with Rauch and Hasegawa, I found that
they are also disappointed. They asked me about the contextuality meaning. And
they performed the brilliant experiments [46, 95] to test contextuality in the frame-
work of neuron interferometry! They had a vague picture of what was tested. They
had a vague picture of what was tested and what is the physical meaning of their
experimental results!
Then, in Stockholm by being in the Ph.D. defense jury of one student who was
supervised by prof. Bengtsson (let call her Alice), I asked Alice about the physical
meaning of contextuality. (Her thesis was about it.) Alice answered that she has no
idea about the physical interpretation of advanced mathematical results obtained in
her thesis. Generally I like discussions. To stimulate a debate, I told that Rauch and
Hasegawa had the strange idea that contextuality is just noncommutativity, a sort
of the order effect in the sequential measurements (this was the ﬁnal output of our
discussions in Vienna). Unfortunately, in Stockholm the discussion (with comments
of a few top experts, including Bengtsson and Lindblad) quickly ﬁnished with the
conclusion that the question is interesting, but not for the Ph.D.-defense.
Jump from Contextuality to Bell Inequalities
Typically by writing a paper about contextuality in QM one starts by referring to
this notion as JMC: dependence of the outcomes of some observable a on its joint
measurement with another observable b (see Sect.17.13). However, this deﬁnition is
countefactual and cannot be used in the experimental framework. Nevertheless, the
“universal contextuality writer” is not disappointed by this situation and he imme-
diately jumps to the Bell inequalities [60, 62] which are treated as noncontextual
inequalities [14]. Moreover, often contextuality is identiﬁed with the violation of the
Bell inequalities. This identiﬁcation shadows the problem of the physical meaning
of contextuality. One jumps from the problem of understanding to calculation of a
numerical quantity, the degree of the violation of some Bell inequality. Such inequal-
ities are numerous. And they can be tested in different experimental situations and
generate the permanent ﬂow of highly recognized papers.
I suggested the following critical illustration to this strategy (contextuality = vio-
lation of the Bell inequalities) [308]. in the CP-framework consider the notion of
a random sequence. Theory of randomness is the result of the intensive research
(Mises, Church, Kolmogorov, Solomovov, Chatin, Martin-Löf; see [271]). This the-

17.1 Preliminary Discussion
281
oretical basis led to elaboration of the variety of randomness tests which are used to
check whether some sequence of outputs of physical or digital random generator is
random. The NIST test (a batch of tests for randomness) is the most widely used.
So, here we also use tests, but beyond them there is the well developed theory of ran-
domness. In particular, this leads to understanding that even if a sequence x passed
the NIST test, this does not imply that it is random. In principle, there can be found
another test such that x would not pass it. The latter would not be a surprise.
In contrast to the above illustration by randomness theory, in quantum information
theory contextuality is per deﬁnition the violation of some noncontextual (Bell)
inequality.1 So, the theoretical notion is identiﬁed with a test. This is really bad!
Not only from the theoretical viewpoint, but even from the practical one. As was
mentioned, by working with randomness people understand well that even passing
the NIST test does not guarantee randomness. In QM, passing the Bell test (in the
sense of the violation of some Bell type inequality [60, 62]) is per deﬁnition is
equivalent to contextuality. This is wrong strategy which led to skews in handling
quantum contextuality.
Bell Tests in Physics: Signaling and Other Anomalies in Data
The ﬁrst signs that addiction to one concrete test of contextuality (Bell inequalities
[60, 62]) may lead to the wrong conclusions were observed by Adenier and Khren-
nikov [8]. Adenier was working on the translation of the Ph.D. thesis of Alain Aspect
[30] (due to the joint agreement with prof. Aspect and Springer) and he pointed out
to me that he found some strange anomalies in Aspect’s data. One of them was
signaling. i.e., dependence of detection probability on one side (Bob’s lab) on the
selection of an experimental setting on another side (Alice’s lab).
Then, we found [8] signaling in the data from the famous experiment of Weihs
closing the nonlocality loophole [459] (see also [458]); we point out to Weihs’ reply
[460] to our critical analysis of his data. (At that time we understood that it is very
difﬁcult if possible at all to get the rough statistical data from experimenters, i.e.,
not the beautiful graphs illustrating articles, but click by click data. We were really
surprised by experimenters unwillingness to share their data with researchers willing
to analyze their experiments and in this way to attract further attention to their results.
Even my wide contants in quantum community did not help us so much. Only Gregor
Weihs sent his data, as a batch of CDs, to Guillaume Adenier. And, as any good will,
this data sharing was punished by our ﬁnding of signaling in it.)
Our publications [8] attracted attention to the problem of signaling in data col-
lectedinquantumexperiments.Slowlypeoplestartedtounderstandthatexperimenter
cannot be happy by just getting higher degree of the violation of say the CHSH-
inequality, with higher conﬁdence. Often this implied the increase of the degree
1 We point out to the variety of the Bell type inequalities; see article [259] on the analysis of
equivalence of the statistical tests based on some inequalities.

of signaling. Experimenters started to check the hypothesis of signaling in data.
Unfortunately, our message was ignored by some experimenters, e.g., the data from
the “the ﬁrst loophole free experiment” [199] demonstrated statistically signiﬁcant
signaling.
Any Bell test should be combined with the test of experimental statistical data on
signaling.
We pointed out that signaling was not the only problem in Aspect’s data. As
he noted in his thesis [30], the data contains “anomalies” of the following type.
Although the CHSH-combination of correlations violates the CHSH-inequality, the
correlation for the concrete pair of angles θ1, φ, as the function of these angles, does
not match the theoretical prediction of QM, the graph of the experimental data differs
essentially from the theoretical cos-graph. Our attempts to discuss this problem with
other experimenters generated only replies that “we do not have such anomalies in
our data”.
17.2
Växjö Model
In the probabilistic terms, complementarity (incompatibility of observables) means
that their joint probability distribution (JPD) does not exist. Instead of the JPD,
one has to operate with context-dependent family of probability spaces—the Växjö
probability model (see [232–234, 236, 238, 239, 245, 249, 251, 256]):
MZ = (PC, C ∈Z),
where Z is a family of contexts and, for each C ∈Z,
PC = (C, FC, PC)
is Kolmogorov probability space [318] (Sect.16.4). Here C is a sample space, FC
is a σ-algebra of subsets of C (events), and PC is a probability measure on FC. All
these structures depend on context C. To develop a fruitful theory, Z must satisfy to
some conditions on inter-relation between contexts [232–234, 238, 239, 249, 251,
256]. In CP the points of C represent elementary events, the most simple events
which can happen within context C. Although these events are elementary, their
structure can be complex and include the events corresponding to appearance of some
parameters (“hidden variables”) for a system under observation and measurement
devices, times of detection and so on.
We remark that the Växjö probability model serves as the mathematical basis of
the the Växjö interpretation of quantum mechanics, the contextual statistical inter-
pretation [236, 245].
Observables are given by random variables on contextually-labeled probability
spaces, measurable functions, aC : C →R. The same semantically deﬁned observ-

able a is represented by a family of random variables (aC, C ∈Za), where Za is
the family of contexts for which the a-observable can be measured. In MZ averages
and correlations are also labeled by contexts,

R⊭xyd Pa,b|C(x, y), (17.2)
where Pa|C is the probability distribution of ac and Pa,b|C is the JPD of the pair of
random variables (aC, bC). In (17.1) C ∈Za and in (17.2) C ∈Za,b = Za ∩Zb.
Since in context Za,b both observables a and b are represented by random variables,
namely, by aC and bC, it is natural to assume that in this context both observables
can be measured and the measure-theoretic JPD Pa,b|C represents mathematically
the JPD for joint measurements of the pair of observables (a, b).
In further sections, we analyze the probabilistic structure of QM by considering
the Bell inequalities [60, 62] and concentrating on the CHSH-inequality [106]2 and
the Fine theorem [150].
The Växjö probability model serves as the mathematical basis of the Växjö inter-
pretation of quantum theory (Sect.20.4).
Mental Contextuality
In this book we are interested in applications of quantum theory outside of physics,
e.g., to cognition, decision-making, and social science. The following questions nat-
urally arise:
1. What are lessons from QM?
2. What are cognitive and social specialties?
The main lesson (from my viewpoint) is that the Bohr contextuality-
complementarity principle is the basic principle of quantum theory. Everything else is
its consequence (including JMC and the statements concerning the Bell inequalities).
The main commonality between quantum physical and mental measurements is the
irreduciblecharacterofcontributionoftheinteractionbetweenasystemandmeasure-
ment device (including self-measurements performed by the brain, its mental func-
tions, Chap.6). Here “system” is understood as an information system (see further
chapters of the book). Our decisions, emotions, thoughts are outputs of such complex
interactions. This viewpoint matches especially well to the model of unconscious-
conscious interaction. In this model, a mental system and a self-measuring apparatus
2 See article [259] on using different Bell inequalities in experimental studies.

Contextuality, Complementarity, and Bell Tests
(a mental function) are informationally located in some regions of the unconscious
and consciousness, respectively (Chap.7).
As in physics, this viewpoint on measurements outputs leads to understanding
that some mental phenomena are complementarity and that there exist incompatible
mental (self-)observations.
As was pointed out by Dzhafarov et al. [133] all known experiments with mental
observables (say questions or tasks) demonstrate statistically signiﬁcant signaling.
We point to two alternatives:
1. Careful analysis of the cognitive experiments would point out to the sources of
signaling which are compatible with the quantum formalism. These sources can
be either technicalities, i.e., non-clean data or sampling of insufﬁcient size, or the
violations of some conditions assumed in the Bell test, the conditions on the state
preparation and measurement procedures.
2. Signaling in mental data is irreducible, mental contextuality cannot be modeled
within the quantum formalism.
We shall discuss these issues in further sections of this chapter.
Summary of Preliminary Discussion
We can conclude the discussion with a few statements:
• The theoretical deﬁnition of contextuality as JMC suffers of appealing to conter-
factuals.
• Identiﬁcation of contextuality with the violation of the Bell inequalities is not
justiﬁed, neither physically nor mathematically (in the last case such an approach
does not match the mathematical tradition).
• The Bell tests have to accompanied with test on signaling.
• “Unuploaded to internet experiments have no results” [265].
• Probabilistically contextuality-complementarity is described by contextual prob-
ability (as by the Växjö model, [232–234, 238, 239, 249, 251, 256]).
17.3
Thinking over Bohr’s Ideas
This section is devoted to thinking over Bohr’s foundational works in terms of con-
textuality.

17.3 Thinking over Bohr’s Ideas
285
17.3.1
Bohr Contextuality
The crucial question is about the physical meaning of contextuality; without answer-
ing to it, JMC (even by ignoring counterfactuality) is mystical, especially for spa-
tially separated systems. Even spooky action at a distance is welcome—to resolve
this mystery.
In series of papers [281, 286] the physical meaning of contextuality was clariﬁed
through referring to the Bohr’s complementarity principle. Typically this principle is
reduced to wave-particle duality. (In fact, Bohr had never used the latter terminology.)
However, Bohr’s formulation of the complementarity principle is essentially deeper.
Complementarity is not postulated; for Bohr, it is the natural consequence of the
irreducible dependence of observable’s outcome on the experimental context. Thus,
the outcomes of quantum observables are generated in the complex process of the
interaction of a system and a measurement device [74] (see also [300, 383]). This
dependence on the complex of experimental conditions is nothing else than a form
of contextuality, Bohr-contextuality (Sect.17.3.2). We remark that JMC is its special
case. But, in contrast to JMC, the physical interpretation of Bohr-contextuality is
transparent—dependence of results of measurements on experimental contexts. And
it does not involve the use of conterfactuals.
Such contextuality is the seed of complementarity, the existence of incompatible
observables. (We recall that observables are incompatible if they cannot be measured
jointly.) Moreover, contextuality without incompatibility loses its value.
If all observables were compatible, then they might be jointly measured in a single
experimental context and multicontextual consideration would be meaningless.
One can go in deeper foundations of QM and ask:
Why is dependence on experimental context (system-apparatus interaction) is
irreducible?
Bohr’s answer is that irreducibility is due to the existence of indivisible quantum
of action given by the Planck constant (see articles [299, 301] for discussion and
references).
We stress that the interactions considered in quantum theory are not the classi-
cal force-like interactions. QM-interactions are represented by unitary operators and
they follow the “physical laws” of quantum theory. This is the operational viewpoint
on interaction which is widely used in theory of open quantum system. It is math-
ematically formalized in the indirect measurement scheme and the mathematical
construction of quantum instruments from unitary interaction between a system and
apparatus [114, 115, 364–366].
17.3.2
Bohr’s Principle of Contextuality-Complementarity
The Bohr principle of complementarity [74] is typically presented as wave-particle
duality, incompatibility of the position and momentum observables. The latter means
the impossibility of their joint measurement. We remark that Bohr started with the

286
17
Contextuality, Complementarity, and Bell Tests
problemofincompatibilityoftheseobservablesbydiscussingthetwoslitexperiment.
In this experiment position represented by “which slit?” observable and momentum
is determined the detection dot on the registration screen. (This screen is covered
by photo-emulsion and placed on some distance beyond the screen with two slits.)
Later Bohr extended the wave-particle duality to arbitrary observables which cannot
be jointly measured and formulated the principle of complementarity. He justiﬁed
this principle by emphasizing contextuality of quantum measurements. The Bohr’s
viewpoint on contextuality was wider than in the modern discussion on quantum
contextuality related to the Bell inequality. The later is contextuality of joint mea-
surement with a compatible observable (Sect.17.13).
In 1949, Bohr [74] presented the essence of complementarity in the following
widely cited statement:
This crucial point ... implies the impossibility of any sharp separation between the behaviour
of atomic objects and the interaction with the measuring instruments which serve to deﬁne
the conditions under which the phenomena appear. In fact, the individuality of the typical
quantum effects ﬁnds its proper expression in the circumstance that any attempt of subdi-
viding the phenomena will demand a change in the experimental arrangement introducing
new possibilities of interaction between objects and measuring instruments which in prin-
ciple cannot be controlled. Consequently, evidence obtained under different experimental
conditions cannot be comprehended within a single picture, but must be regarded as comple-
mentary in the sense that only the totality of the phenomena exhausts the possible information
about the objects.
In short, Bohr’s way to the complementarity principle, the claim on the existence
of incompatible quantum observables, can be presented as the following chain of
reasoning [281, 286]:
• CONT1 An outcome of any observable is composed of the contributions of a
system and a measurement device.
• CONT2 The whole experimental context has to be taken into account.
• INCOMP1 There is no reason to expect that all experimental contexts can be
combined with each other and all observables can be measured jointly; thus some
observables can be incompatible.
• INCOMP2 The Heisenberg uncertainty principle implies that the position and
momentum observables are incompatible.
The statements CONT1 + CONT2 and INCOMP1+ INCOMP12 compose the
contextual and incompatibility parts of Bohr’s reasoning. Bohr considered the two slit
experiment as the experimental conﬁrmation of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.
Hence, for him INCOMP2 was experimentally veriﬁed.
In the light of such structuring of Bohr’s thinking, it might be more natural to
speak about two Bohr’s principles:
• Contextuality Principle.
• Complementarity Principle.

17.4 Probabilistic Viewpoint on Contextuality-Complementarity
287
We can unify these two principles and speak about the Contextuality-
Complementarity Principle, instead of simply the complementarity principle.
Unfortunately, the contextual dimension of the complementarity is typically missing
in the discussions on quantum foundations.
Of course, the fact that outcomes of observables depend irreducibly on exper-
imental conditions, does not imply the existence of other experimental conditions
which are incompatible. However, if the outcomes were the objective properties of
physical systems, then at least in principle any two experimental contexts would be
combinable.
By speaking that the wave and particle properties cannot be merged in a single
experimental framework (the wave-particle duality) we have to remember that the
seed of their dispersing is contextuality: they are determined within two different
experimental contexts.
This is the good place to remark that it is possible to establish wave-particle
correlations in the conditional experiments as in article [152], where amplitude of the
electromagnetic ﬁeld was conditioned to photon detection. This experiment supports
treatment of quantum probabilities as conditional ones.
In the light of Bohr-contextuality, the following natural question arises:
How can one prove that the concrete observables a and b cannot be jointly mea-
sured (i.e., that they are incompatible)?
From the viewpoint of experimental veriﬁcation, the notion of incompatibility is
difﬁcult. How can one show that the joint measurement of a and b is impossible?
One can refer to the mathematical formalism of quantum theory and say that the
observables a and b cannot be jointly measurable if the corresponding Hermitian
operators A and B do not commute. But, another debater can say that may be this
is just the artifact of the quantum formalism: yes, the operators do not commute,
but observables still can be jointly measured. The latter argument was used by some
experts in quantum foundations against the appeal to the Heisenberg uncertainty
principle as justiﬁcation of the existence of incompatible observables—INCOMP2.
17.4
Probabilistic Viewpoint on
Contextuality-Complementarity
The basic analysis on the (in)compatibility problem is done in the probabilistic terms.
Suppose that observables a, b, c, . . . can be in principle jointly measured, but we
are not able to design the corresponding measurement procedure. Nevertheless, the
assumption of joint measurability, even hypothetical, implies the existence of JPD.
What are consequences of JPD’s existence?
We shall comeback to this question in Sect.17.4. Now we remark that the prin-
ciple of contextuality-complementarity can be reformulated in probabilistic terms.
In short, we can say that the measurement part of QM is a (special) calculus of
context-dependent probabilities. This viewpoint was presented in a series of works

288
17
Contextuality, Complementarity, and Bell Tests
summarized in monograph [251] devoted to the calculus of context dependent prob-
ability measures (PC), C ∈Z, where Z is a family of contexts constrained by some
consistency conditions.
We emphasize that QP is a special contextual probabilistic calculus. Its specialty
consists in the possibility to use a quantum state (the wave function) |ψ⟩to unify
generally incompatible contexts. This is the important feature of QP playing the
crucial role in quantum foundations.
In classical statistical physics the contextuality of observations is not emphasized.
Here it is assumed that it is possible to proceed in the CP-framework: to introduce
a single context-independent probability measure P and reproduce the probability
distributions of all physical observables on the basis of P. This is really possible.
However, the careful analysis of interplay of probability measures appearing in clas-
sical physics shows that even here contexuality cannot be ignored. In articles [240,
246], there are considered models, e.g., in theory of complex disordered systems
(spin glasses), such that it is impossible to operate with just one ﬁxed probability
measure P. A variety of context dependent probabilities have to be explored. We
especially emphasize the paper on classical probabilistic entanglement [11].
Existence of Joint Probability Distribution
Let P = (, F , P) be a Kolmogorov probability space [318]. Each random variable
a :  →R determines the probability distribution Pa. The crucial point is that all
these distributions are encoded in the same probability measure P : Pa(α) = P(ω ∈
 : a(ω) = α). (We consider only discrete random variables.)
In CP, the probability distributions of all observables (represented by random
variables) can be consistently uniﬁed on the basis of P.
For any pair of random variables a, b, their JPD Pa,b is deﬁned and the following
condition of marginal consistency holds:
Pa(α) =

β
Pa,b(α, β)
(17.3)
This condition means that observation of a jointly with b does not change the proba-
bility distribution of a. Equality (17.3) implies that, for any two observables b and c,

β
Pa,b(α, β) =

γ
Pa,c(α, γ ).
(17.4)
In fact, condition (17.4) is equivalent to (17.3): by selecting the random variable
c such that c(ω) = 1 almost everywhere, we see that (17.4) implies (17.3). These
considerations are easily generalized to a system of k random variables a1, . . . , ak.

17.4 Probabilistic Viewpoint on Contextuality-Complementarity
289
Their JPD is well deﬁned,
Pa1,...,ak(α1, . . . , αk) = P(ω ∈ : a1(ω) = α1, · · · , ak(ω) = αk).
And marginal consistency conditions holds for all subsets of random variables
(ai1, . . . , aim), m < k).
Consider now some system of experimental observables a1, . . . , ak. If the exper-
imental design for their joint measurement exists, then it is possible to deﬁne their
JPD Pa1,...,ak(α1, . . . , αk) (as the relative frequency of their joint outcomes). This
probability measure P ≡Pa1,...,ak can be used to deﬁne the Kolmogorov probability
space, i.e., the case of joint measurement can be described by CP.
Now consider the general situation: only some groups of observables can be
jointly measured. For example, there are three observables a, b, c and only the pairs
(a, b) and (a, c) can be measurable, i.e., only JPDs Pa,b and Pa,c can be deﬁned and
associated with the experimental data. There is no reason to assume the existence of
JPD Pa,b,c. In this situation equality (17.4) may be violated. In the terminology of
QM, this violation is called signaling.
Typically one considers two labs, Alice’s and Bob’s labs. Alice measures the
a-observable and Bob can choose whether to measure the b- or c-observable. If

β
Pa,b(α, β) ̸=

γ
Pa,c(α, γ ),
(17.5)
one says that the a-measurement procedure is disturbed (in some typically unknown
way) by the selection of a measurement procedure by Bob, some signal from Bob’s
lab approaches Alice’s lab and changes the probability distribution. This terminol-
ogy, signaling versus no-signaling, is adapted to measurements on spatially separated
systems and related to the issue of nonlocality. In quantum-like models, one typically
works with spatially localized systems and is interested in contextuality (what ever
it means). Therefore we called condition (17.4) marginal consistency (consistency
of marginal probabilities) and (17.5) is marginal inconsistency. In the further pre-
sentation we shall use changeably both terminologies, marginal consistency versus
inconsistency and no-signaling versus signaling.
In future we shall be mainly interested in the CHSH inequality. In this frame-
work, we shall work with four observables a1, a2 and b1, b2; experimenters are able to
design measurement procedures only for some pairs of them, say (ai, b j), i, j = 1, 2.
In this situation, there is no reason to expect that one can deﬁne (even mathemati-
cally) the JPD Pa1,a2,b1,b2(α1, α2, β1, β2). This situation is typical for QM. This is a
complex interplay of theory and experiment. Only probability distributions Pai,b j can
be experimentally veriﬁed. However, in theoretical speculation, we can consider JPD
Pa1,a2,b1,b2 as a mathematical quantity. If it existed, we might expect that there would
be some experimental design for joint measurement of the quadruple of observables
(a1, a2, b1, b2). On the other hand, if it does not exist, then it is meaningless even to
try to design an experiment for their joint measurement.

290
17
Contextuality, Complementarity, and Bell Tests
Now we turn back to marginal consistency; in general (if Pa1,a2,b1,b2 does not exist),
it may be violated. However, in QM it is not violated: there is no signaling. This is the
miracle feature of QM. Often it is coupled to spatial separation of systems: a1 or a2 are
measured on S1 and b1 or b2 on S2. And these systems are so far from each other that
the light signal emitted from Bob’s lab cannot approach Alice’s lab during the time
of the measurement and manipulation with the selection of experimental settings.
However, as we shall see no-signaling is the general feature of the quantum formalism
which has nothing to do with spatial separability nor even with consideration of the
compound systems.
17.5
Clauser, Horne, Shimony, and Holt (CHSH)
Inequality
We restrict further considerations to the CHSH-framework, i.e., we shall not consider
other types of Bell inequalities.
How can one get to know whether JPD exists? The answer to this question is
given by a theorem of Fine [150] concerning the CHSH inequality.
Consider dichotomous observables ai and b j(i, j = 1, 2) taking values ±1. In
each pair (ai, b j) observables are compatible, i.e., they can be jointly measurable
and pairwise JPDs Pai,b j are well deﬁned. Consider correlation
⟨aib j⟩= E[aib j] =

αβ d Pai,b j(α, β);
in the discrete case,
⟨aib j⟩= E[aib j] =

αβ
αβ Pai,b j (α, β).
By Fine’s theorem JPD Pa1,a2,b1,b2 exists if and only if the CHSH-inequality for these
correlations is satisﬁed:
|⟨a1b1⟩+ ⟨a1b2⟩+ ⟨a2b1⟩−⟨a2b2⟩| ≤2.
(17.6)
and the three other inequalities corresponding to all possible permutations of indexes
i, j = 1, 2.
Derivation of CHSH Inequality Within Kolmogorov Theory
The crucial assumption for derivation of the CHSH-inequality is that all correlations
are w.r.t. the same Kolmogorov probability space P = (, F , P) and that all observ-

17.5 Clauser, Horne, Shimony, and Holt (CHSH) Inequality
291
ables ai, b j, i, j = 1, 2, can be mathematically represented as random variables on
this space. Under the assumption of the JPD existence, one can select the sample
space  = {−1, +1}4 and the probability measure P = Pa1,a2,b1,b2. Thus, the CHSH
inequality has the form,



[a1(ω)b1(ω) + a1(ω)b2(ω) + a2(ω)b1(ω) −a2(ω)b2(ω)]d P(ω)
 ≤2. (17.7)
The variable ω can include hidden variables of a system, measurement devices,
detection times, and so on. It is only important the possibility to use the same prob-
ability space to model all correlations. The latter is equivalent to the existence of
JPD Pa1,a2,b1,b2. This is the trivial part of Fine’s theorem, JPD implies the CHSH
inequality. The other way around is more difﬁcult [150].
This inequality can be proven by integration of the inequality
−2 ≤a1(ω)b1(ω) + a1(ω)b2(ω) + a2(ω)b1(ω) −a2(ω)b2(ω) ≤2
which is the consequence of the inequality
−2 ≤a1b1 + a1b2 + a2b1 −a2b2 ≤2
which holds for any quadrupole of real numbers belonging [−1, +1].
Role of No-signaling in Fine Theorem
The above presentation of Fine’s result is common for physics’ folklore. However,
Fine did not consider explicitly the CHSH inequalities presented above, see (17.6).
He introduced four inequalities that are necessary and sufﬁcient for the JPD to exist,
but these inequalities are expressed differently to the CHSH inequalities. The CHSH
inequalities are derivable from Fine’s four inequalities stated in Theorem 3 of his
paper.
We remark that the existence of the quadruple JPD implies marginal consistency
(no-signaling). And the Fine theorem presupposed that marginal consistency.
This is the good place to make the following remark. In quantum physics this
very clear and simple meaning of violation of the CHSH-inequality (non-existence
of JPD) is obscured by the issue of nonlocality. However, in this article we are
not aimed to criticize the nonlocal interpretation of QM. If somebody speaks about
spooky action at a distance and other mysteries of QM, we have no quarrel with this,
since we only use the quantum formalism, not its special interpretation. Finally, we
point out that the Bell type inequalities were considered already by Boole (1862)
[76, 77] as necessary conditions for existence of a JPD.

CHSH-Inequality for Quantum Observables
In this section we present the purely quantum treatment of the CHSH inequality and
highlight the role of incompatibility in its violation (we follow article [286]).
Non-compound Systems
Although in QM the CHSH inequality is typically studied for compound systems
with the emphasis to the role of the tensor product structure of the state space, in
this section we shall not emphasize the latter and proceed for an arbitrary state space
and operators. Consequences and simpliﬁcations for the tensor product case will be
presented in Sect.17.6.
Observables ai, b j are described by (Hermitian) operators Ai, B j, i, j = 1, 2,
[Ai, B j] = 0, i, j = 1, 2.
(17.9)

17.6 CHSH-Inequality for Quantum Observables
293
We remark that generally
[A1, A2] ̸= 0, [B1, B2] ̸= 0,
i.e., the observables in the pairs a1, a2 and b1, b2 do not need to be compatible.
Observables under consideration are dichotomous with values ±1. Hence, the
corresponding operators are such that A2
i = B2
j = I. The latter plays the crucial role
in derivation of the Landau identity (17.13).
Consider the CHSH correlation represented in the quantum formalism and nor-
malized by 1/2,
⟨B⟩= 1
2[⟨A1B1⟩+ ⟨A1B2⟩+ ⟨A2B1⟩−⟨A2B2⟩].
(17.10)
This correlation is expressed via the Bell-operator:
B = 1
2[A1(B1 + B2) + A2(B1 −B2)]
(17.11)
as
⟨B⟩= ⟨ψ|B|ψ⟩.
(17.12)
Simple calculations lead to the Landau identity:
B2 = I −(1/4)[A1, A2][B1, B2].
(17.13)
If at least one commutator equals to zero, i.e.,
[A1, A2] = 0,
(17.14)
or
[B1, B2] = 0,
(17.15)
then, for quantum observables, we obtain the inequality
|⟨B⟩| ≤1.
(17.16)
Derivation of (17.16) was based solely on quantum theory. This inequality is the
consequence of compatibility for at least one pair of observables, A1, A2 or B1, B2.
Symbolically Eq.(17.16) is the usual CHSH-inequality, but its meaning is different.
Equation (17.16) can be called the quantum CHSH inequality.

Contextuality, Complementarity, and Bell Tests
Compound Systems
Here, H = Ha ⊗Hb and A j = A j ⊗I, B j = I ⊗B j, where Hermitian operators
A j and B j act in Ha and Hb, respectively. Incompatibility of observables in factors
of the tensor product is called local incompatibility.
Theorem 17.6.1 Conjunction of local incompatibilities in HA and HB is the neces-
sary
and
sufﬁcient
condition
for
the
violation
of
the
quantum
CHSH-inequality.
□
Thus, the CHSH-inequality for observables which can be mathematically mod-
elled within the quantum formalism is violated iff [A1, A2] ̸= 0 and [B1, B2] ̸= 0.
This result is very supporting for coupling of the violation of the Bell type inequalities
with incompatibility of observables.
Tsirelson Bound
By using Landau identity (7.6) we can derive the Tsirelson bound 2
√
2 for the
CHSH correlation of quantum observables, i.e., observables which are represented
by Hermitian operators Ai, B j, i, j = 1, 2, with spectrum ±1, so A2
i = B2
j = I. For
such operators, for any state |ψ⟩, we have:
|⟨A1B1⟩+ ⟨A1B2⟩+ ⟨A2B1⟩−⟨A2B2⟩| ≤2
√
2.
(17.17)
On the other hand, if observables are not described by QM, then this bound can
be exceeded. For the Växjö contextual probability model, the CHSH correlation may
approach the value 4; the same is true for CbD model.
17.7
Signaling in Physical Versus Psychological
Experiments
By using the quantum calculus of probabilities, it is easy to check whether the no-
signaling condition holds for quantum observables. However, experimenters were
focused on observing as high violation of (17.6) as possible and they ignored the
no-signaling condition. However, if the latter is violated, then a JPD automatically
does not exist, and there is no reason to expect that (17.6) would be satisﬁed.
The ﬁrst paper highlighting the signaling problem in quantum experimental
research was the article of Adenier and Khrennikov [8]. They demonstrated that sta-
tistical data collected in the basic experiments (for that time) performed by Aspect
[30] and Weihs [459] violate the no-signaling condition. Nowadays no signaling

condition is widely discussed in quantum information theory, but without referring
to the pioneer work of Adenier and Khrennikov [8].
The experiments to check CHSH and other Bell-type inequalities were also per-
formed for mental observables in the form of questions asked to people [23, 24], [10,
53, 91, 108, 133, 136]. The ﬁrst such experiment was done in 2008 [108] and was
based on the theoretical paper of Khrennikov [244]. As was pointed out by Dzha-
farov et al. [133], all known experiments of this type suffer of signaling. Moreover,
in contrast to physics, in psychology there are no theoretical reasons to expect no-
signaling. In this situation Fine’s theorem is not applicable. And Dzhafarov and his
coauthors were the ﬁrst who understood the need of adapting the Bell-type inequal-
ities to experimental data exhibiting signaling. Obviously, the interplay of whether
or not a JPD exists for the quadruple of observables
s = (a1, a2, b1, b2)
(17.18)
can’t be considered for signaling data.
17.8

Contextual Indexing
Dzhafarov and his coauthors [131–135] proposed to consider, instead of quadruple
of observables s, the corresponding octuple s which is generated by doubling each
observable and associating s with four contexts of measurements of pairs,
C11 = (a1, b1), C12 = (a1, b2), C21 = (a2, b1), C22 = (a2, b2).
(17.19)
Thus, the basic object of CbD-theory (for the CHSH inequality) is octuple of observ-
ables
s =

(a11, b11), (a12, b21), (a21, b12), (a22, b22)

,
(17.20)
so, e.g., observable a1 measured jointly with observable b j is denoted a1 j.
The essence of CbD is coupling of observables to contexts. This coupling gener-
ates double-indexing of observables. The mathematical representations of the observ-
able ai measured jointly with the observables b j, j = 1, 2 cannot be identiﬁed. This
is the basic foundational counterpart of CbD.
CbD uses the random variables language to present observables, so it operates
with four pairs of random variables:
S =

(A11, B11), (A12, B21), (A21, B12), (A22, B22)

,
(17.21)

Contextuality, Complementarity, and Bell Tests
generally each pair of random variables is deﬁned on its own probability space,
Pi j = (i j, Fi j, Pi j).
So, CbD and the Växjö contextual probability model have the same foundational
basis and operate with the families of Kolmogorov probability spaces corresponding
to measurement contexts. But technically they diverge.
Coupling Method
The main mathematical apparatus of CbD is the coupling method which is widely
used in CP [338, 426]. The Växjö model differs from CbD by the calculus of transition
probabilities.
Let Pi = (i, Fi, Pi), i = 1, 2, be two Kolmogorov probability spaces and let
Xi be random variables on these spaces. Then a coupling of X1 and X2 is a new
probability space P = (, F , P) over which there are two random variables Y1 and
Y2 such that Y1 has the same distribution as X1 while Y2 has the same distribution as
X2.
In the CHSH-framework the coupling method is applied as follows. Let Pi j =
(i j, Fi j, Pi j) be probability spaces with vector random variables (Ai j, B ji), then
their coupling is a probability space P = (, F , P) over which there are deﬁned
four vector random variables (Ai j, B ji) having the same probability distributions as
the vectors (Ai j, B ji).
The coupling method can be considered as a mechanism of embedding of con-
textual probability model into CP. This embedding gives the possibility to apply
the mathematical apparatus of CP for generally non-Kolmogorovian model. Such
embedding is not unique and in CbD one searches for an optimal (in some sense, see
below) coupling. We remark that the Växjö model can also be embedded in some
Kolmogorov probability space and with such embedding the contextual probabilities
are realized as the classical conditional probabilities [266].
Thus, coupling technique gives the possibility to operate with variety of octuples
of random variables
S = (A11, B11, A12, B21, A21, B12, A22, B22),
(17.22)
deﬁned on the same probability space and giving couplings for the system of con-
textual random variables S.

Measure of Contextuality
By moving from quadruple S to octuple S, one confronts the problem of identity
of an observable which is now represented by two different random variables, e.g.,
the observable ai is represented by the random variables Ai j(ω), j = 1, 2. In the
presence of signaling one cannot expect the equality of two such random variables
almosteverywhere.Dzhafarovetal.cameupwithanoveltreatmentoftheobservable-
identity problem.
It is assumed that averages
ma;i j = ⟨Ai j⟩, mb;i j = ⟨Bi j⟩
(17.23)
and covariation
Ci j = ⟨Ai j B ji⟩
(17.24)
are ﬁxed. These are measurable quantities. They can be statistically veriﬁed by exper-
iment.
Set

(17.26)
This is the experimentally veriﬁable measure of signaling.
We remark that in the coupling representation the joint satisfaction of the CHSH
inequalities, i.e., (17.6) and other inequalities obtained from it via permutations, can
be written in the form:
max
i j
|⟨A11B11⟩+ ⟨A12B21⟩+ ⟨A21B12⟩+ ⟨A21B22⟩−2⟨Ai j B ji⟩| ≤2.
(17.27)
In the signaling-free situation, e.g., in quantum physics, the difference between the
left-hand and right-hand sides is considered as the measure of contextuality. Denote
(1/2 times) this quantity by CHSH. It is also experimentally veriﬁable.
Then Dzhafarov and coauthors introduced quantity
(P) =

ai(P) +

b j(P),
(17.28)
where
ai(P) = P(ω : Ai1(ω) ̸= Ai2(ω)), b j (P) = P(ω : B j1(ω) ̸= B j2(ω)).
(17.29)

298
17
Contextuality, Complementarity, and Bell Tests
Here ai(P) characterizes mismatching of representations of observable ai by ran-
dom variables Ai1 and Ai2 with respect to probability measure P; b j(P) is inter-
preted in the same way. The problem of the identity of observables is formulated as
the mismatching minimization or identity maximization problem
(P) →min
(17.30)
with respect to all octuple probability distributions P satisfying constraints (17.23),
(17.24). And it turns out, that
min = min (P).
(17.31)
It is natural to consider the solutions of the identity maximization problem (17.30)
as CP-representations for contextual system S. The corresponding random variables
have the highest possible, in the presence of signaling, degree of identity.
The quantity
min −0
is considered as the measure of “genuine contextuality”. This approach is very useful
tostudycontextualityinthepresenceofsignaling.Thekeypointisthecouplingofthis
measure of contextuality with the problem of the identity of observables measured
in different contexts. As was pointed out in article [134] :
...contextuality means that random variables recorded under mutually incompatible condi-
tions cannot be join together into a single system of jointly distributed random variables,
provided one assumes that their identity across different conditions changes as little as pos-
sibly allowed by direct cross-inﬂuences (equivalently, by observed deviations from marginal
selectivity).
Bell–Dzhafarov–Kujala Inequality
This approach to contextuality due to Dzhafarov–Kujala can be reformulated in the
CHSH-manner by using what we can call CHSH-BDK inequality:
max
i j
|⟨A11B11⟩+ ⟨A12B21⟩+ ⟨A21B12⟩+ ⟨A21B22⟩−2⟨Ai j B ji⟩| −20 ≤2.
(17.32)
It was proven that octuple-system S exhibits no genuine contextuality, i.e.,
min = 0,
(17.33)
if and only if the CHSH-BDK inequality is satisﬁed. The general formula for all
cyclic systems was derived in [137], and a complete theory of cyclic systems is
given in [140].

Mental Signaling: Fundamental or Technical?
As was pointed out in article [133], data collected in psychological experiments con-
tains statistically signiﬁcant signaling patterns. One can wonder whether signaling is
a fundamental feature of mental observations or a mere technicality, perhaps the con-
sequence of badly designed or/and performed experiments. We recall that in physics
signaling patterns were found in all Bell experiments during the ﬁrst 30 years.
Since quantum theory predicts the absence of signaling, signaling patterns in
experimental statistical data were considered to be a technicality.3 Understanding
the technical sources of signaling and ﬁnding ways to eliminate it required great
efforts of the experimenters. Finally, Giustina et al. [175] and Shalm et al. [410]
reported that the null hypothesis of signaling can be rejected for the data collected
in these experiments.
In psychology the situation is more complicated. There are no theoretical reasons
to expect no signaling. And it is not obvious whether signaling is a technicality or
a fundamental feature of cognition. For the moment, only a few experiments have
been performed. One cannot exclude that in the future more advanced experiments
would generate data without signaling. However, it may be that mental signaling is
really a fundamental feature of cognition. In any event, it is interesting to attempt to
ﬁnd non-signaling contextual patterns in human behavior.
As the ﬁrst step towards such experiments, possible experimental sources of men-
tal signaling should be analyzed. We shall do this in the next section.
17.10
Sources of Signaling Compatible with Quantum
Formalism
As was already emphasized, quantum measurement theory is free from signaling:
marginals are consistent with JPDs. Now we prove this simple fact.
Quantum Theory: No-signaling
Consider the quantum Hilbert space formalism, a state given by density operator
ρ; three observables a, b, c represented by operators A, B, C (acting in H) with
spectral families of projectors Ea(x), Eb(x), Ec(x). It is assumed that in each pair
(a, b) and (a, c) the observables are compatible, [A, B] = 0, [A, C] = 0. Then
P(a = x, b = y|ρ) = TrρEa(x)Eb(y), P(a = x, c = y|ρ) = TrρEa(x)Ec(y)
(17.34)
3 Here “technicality” refers to situations in which technical equipment, experimental design,
improper calibration of detectors and so on, inﬂuence an experiment results.

and hence

and we point out that
TrρEa(x) = P(a = x|ρ)
(17.36)
and, hence, both marginal probability distributions coincide with the probability of
measurement of the a-observable alone.
We remark that this proof of no-signaling can be easily extended to generalized
quantum observables given by POVMs. So, in quantum measurement theory there
is no place for signaling. We also recall that signaling (marginal inconsistency) is
absent in classical (Kolmogorov) probability theory [318]. On the other hand, it is
natural for contextual probability (as in the Växjö model [232–234, 238, 239, 249,
251, 256]).
No Signaling Even for Nonlocal Quantum Observables
Now let H = H1 ⊗H2, where H1, H2 be the state spaces of the subsystems S1, S2
of the compound system S = (S1, S2) and let the observables a, b, c are nonlo-
cal, in the sense that their measurements are not localized to subsystems. The
corresponding operators have the form A = A1 ⊗A2, B = B1 ⊗B2, C = C1 ⊗C2,
where A2, B1, C1 do not need to be equal to I. Let us decompose say Ea(x) into ten-
sor product Ea
1(x1) ⊗Ea
2(x2), where outcomes of a are labeled by pairs of numbers
(x1, x2) →x (the map from pairs to the a-outcomes is not one to one). However, the
above general scheme based on (17.35) is still valid. The tensor product decomposi-
tion of projections does not play any role in summation in (17.35).
Nonlocality of observables cannot generate signaling.
This is unexpected fact, because typically signaling is associated with nonlocality.
But, as we have seen, this is not nonlocality of observables.
Now we turn to the quantum CHSH inequality. As we seen in Sect.17.6, for
quantum observables its violation is rigidly coupled only to their incompatibility.
Even if Ai = Ai1 ⊗Ai2, i = 1, 2, but [A1, A2] = 0, then the CHSH inequality is
not violated.
So, by quantum theory signaling is impossible. But, e.g., in decision-making,
signaling patterns (expressing marginal inconsistency) were found in all known
experiments. This is the contradiction between the quantum-like model for decision-

301
making and experiment. This situation questions the whole project on applications
of the quantum formalism to modeling behavior of cognitive systems.
However, there are some “loopholes” which can lead to marginal inconsistency.
Signaling on Selection of Experimental Settings
Consider the Bohm-Bell experiment: a source of photons’ pairs S = (S1, S2) and two
polarization beam splitters (PBSs) in Alice’s and Bob’s labs; their output channels
are coupled to the photo-detectors. Denote orientations of PBSs by θ and φ. Suppose
now that the quantum observables representing measurements on S1 and S2 depend
on both orientations,
a = a(θ, φ), b = b(θ, φ).
(17.37)
They are represented by operators
A = A(θ, φ), B = B(θ, φ).
(17.38)
Thusselectionofsettingφ forPBSinBob’slabchangestheobservable(measurement
procedure) in Alice’s lab and vice verse. This is a kind of signaling between Bob’s
lab and Alice’s lab, signaling carrying information about selection of experimental
settings.4 In such a situation,
P(a(θ, φ) = x, b(θ, φ) = y) = TrρEa(θ,φ)(x)Eb(θ,φ)(y)
(17.39)
and hence


y
Ea(θ,φ′)(y) =
(17.41)
TrρEa(θ,φ′)(x) = P(a(θ, φ′) = x|ρ).
Generally
TrρEa(θ,φ)(x) ̸= TrρEa(θ,φ′)(x).
(17.42)
4 This can also be referred to the absence of free will of experimenters w.r.t. selection of experimental
settings. But, we would not follow this line of thought (which is so natural for philosophy of
superdeterminism).

302

Contextuality, Complementarity, and Bell Tests
or, in the probabilistic terms,
P(a(θ, φ) = x|ρ) ̸= P(a(θ, φ′) = x|ρ).
(17.43)
We remark that decomposition of S into subsystems S1 and S2 and association
of observables a and b with these subsystems did not play any role in quantum
calculations. Such decomposition and coupling it with spatial locality is important
only in the physics as the sufﬁcient condition to prevent signaling on selection of
experimental settings.
In the probabilistic terms each pair of settings determines context C = (θ, φ) and
the corresponding probability space. Thus, we are in the framework of the Växjö
model for contextual probability. Here the possibility of signaling and violation of
the Bell type inequalities is not surprising.
In cognitive experiments, observables are typically questions asked to a system
S (e.g., a human). As we have seen, dependence of questions a and b on the same
set of parameters can generate signaling. This dependence is not surprising. Even
if questions a and b are processed by different regions of the brain, the physical
signaling between these regions cannot be neglected. If θ and φ are the contents of the
a- and b-questions, then after a few milliseconds the area of the brain processing a =
a(θ) would get to “know” about the content of the b-question and thus a-processing
would depend on both parameter, a = a(θ, φ). We remark that an essential part
of information processing in the brain is performed via electromagnetic ﬁeld; such
signals propagate with the light velocity and the brain is very small as a physical
body.
On the other hand, some kind of mental localization must be taken into account;
mental functions performing different tasks use their own information resources
(may be partially overlapping). Without such mental localization, the brain5 would
not be able to discriminate different mental tasks and their outputs. At least for some
mental tasks (e.g., questions), dependence of a on the parameter φ (see (17.37)) can
be weak. For such observables, signaling can be minimized.
Are there other sources of signaling compatible with quantum formalism?
State Dependence on Experimental Settings
Let us turn to quantum physics. Here “signaling” often has the form of real physical
signaling and it can reﬂect the real experimental situation. We now discuss the ﬁrst
Bell-experiment in which the detection loophole was closed [174]. It was performed
in Vienna by Zelinger’s group and it was characterized by statistically signiﬁcant
signaling. By being in Vienna directly after this experiment, I spoke with people
who did it. They told the following story about the origin of signaling—marginal
5 The real situation is more complex; not only the brain, but the whole nervous system is involved
in mental processing.

inconsistency. The photon source was based on laser generating emission of the
pairs of entangled photons from the crystal. It happened (and it was recognized
only afterwards) that the polarization beam splitters (PBSs) reﬂected some photons
backward and by approaching the laser they changed its functioning and backward
ﬂow of photons depended on the orientations of PBSs. In this situation “signaling”
was not from b-PBS to a-PBS, but both PBSs sent signals to the source. Selection of
the concrete pair of PBSs changed functioning of the source; in the quantum terms
this means modiﬁcation of the state preparation procedure. In this case selection of
a pair of orientations leads to generation of a quantum state depending on this pair,
ρab. This state modiﬁcation contributed into the signaling pattern in data.
The above physical experimental illustration pointed out to state’s dependence on
experimental context as a possible source of signaling. It is clear that, for ρ = ρa,b,
generally
TrρabEa(x) ̸= TrρacEa(x).
(17.44)
ThisdependencealsomayleadtoviolationoftheBellinequalities.Intheprobabilistic
terms this is again the area of application of the Växjö model with contexts associated
with quantum states, the probability measures depend on the experimental settings.
We remark that it seems that the state variability depending on experimental
settings was the source of signaling in Weihs’ experiment which closed nonlocality
loophole [459]. At least in this way we interpreted his reply [460] to our paper [8].
Since Weihs’ was able to separate two “labs” to a long distance [459], the signals
from one lab could not approach another during the process of measurement.
In quantum physics experimenters were able to block all possible sources of state’s
dependence on the experimental settings. Thus, it is claimed that one can be sure
that ρ does not depend on a and b. By using the orientations of PBSs θ, φ, i.e.,
ρ = ρ(θ, φ), the latter condition can be written as
∂ρ(θ, φ)
∂θ
= 0, ∂ρ(θ, φ)
∂φ
= 0.
(17.45)
Stability of state preparation is the delicate issue. As we have seen, the source by
itself can be stable and generate approximately the same state ρ, but the presence of
measurement devices can modify its functioning. Moreover, even if any feedback to
the source from measuring devices is excluded, laser’s functioning can be disturbed
by ﬂuctuations. Typically violation of state statsbility cannot be observed directly
and the appearance of a signaling pattern can be considered as a sign on state’s
variation. In physics the signaling can be rigidly associated with ﬂuctuations in state
preparation. Spatial separation leads to local parameter dependence of observables,
i.e., a = a(θ) and b = b(φ).
For cognitive systems, it seems to be impossible to distinguish two sources of
signaling:
• joint dependence on parameters θ, φ determining contents of questions,
• state dependence on θ, φ.

Meal Choice Experiment: Possible Source
of Signaling
Here we brieﬂy present the“meal choice experiment” from article [53].6 Consider
three courses of meal: starters, main course, and deserts. All dishes are assigned with
high (H) or low (L) calorie levels.
Each participant of experiment see on the screen only two courses, say starters
and the main course. Each course contains two dishes, say for starters: two salads.
One dish in each course is of the H-type and another is of the L-type.
Before the experiment each participant (say Alice) is instructed that, in each of
two courses presented on the screen she can select only one dish under the constraint
that the combinations H H and LL are forbidden, e.g., she can select the high calorie
salad and the low calorie dish from the main course or vice verse. From my viewpoint,
this exclusion principle is the crucial part of the experimental design.
Meal courses play the role of systems, i.e.. Sa, Sb, Sc. For these systems we
deﬁne the observables a, b, c yielding the values ±1 corresponding to H/L choices.
The experiment is based on three compound systems Sab = (Sa, Sb), Sbc = (Sb, Sc),
Sac = (Sa, Sc). On these systems one can perform joint measurements (a, b), (b, c),
(a, c).7
By looking at the screen and by seeing the compound system (the two courses
under consideration), e.g., Sab, Alice applies the H −L exclusive principle in the
context of the (a, b)-measurement. At this stage of decision-making, she projects her
mental state |ψ⟩onto the H L −L H entangled state corresponding to this concrete
pair of courses:
|ψ⟩→|ψab⟩= ⟨ψ|HaLb⟩|HaLb⟩+ ⟨ψ|La Hb⟩|La Hb⟩
|⟨ψ|HaLb⟩|2 + |⟨ψ|La Hb⟩|2
≡⟨ψ| +a −b⟩| +a −b⟩+ ⟨ψ| −a +b⟩| +a −b⟩
|⟨ψ| +a −b⟩|2 + |⟨ψ| −a +b⟩|2
.
And, for this state she performs the joint (a, b) measurement generating the correla-
tion ⟨ab⟩≡⟨ab⟩ψab = −1.
Then, for the system Sbc, the (b, c)-measurement is preceded by the mental state
preparation to adjust the H −L-exclusion principle to this measurement:
|ψ⟩→|ψbc⟩= ⟨ψ|HbLc⟩|HbLc⟩+ ⟨ψ|LbHc⟩|LbHc⟩
|⟨ψ|HbLc⟩|2 + |⟨ψ|LbHc⟩|2
≡⟨ψ| +b −c⟩| +b −c⟩+ ⟨ψ| −b +c⟩| +b −c⟩
|⟨ψ| +b −c⟩|2 + |⟨ψ| −b +c⟩|2
.
6 See Sect.A.3 for more mathematical details.
7 In contextuality theory, typically pairs are written to show cyclic structure of measurements:
(a, b), (b, c), (c, a).

17.11 Meal Choice Experiment: Possible Source of Signaling
305
In the same way the (a, c)-measurement on Sac is preceded by the mental state
adjustment:
|ψ⟩→|ψac⟩= ⟨ψ|HaLc⟩|HaLc⟩+ ⟨ψ|La Hc⟩|La Hc⟩
|⟨ψ|HaLc⟩|2 + |⟨ψ|La Hc⟩|2
≡⟨ψ| +a −c⟩| +a −c⟩+ ⟨ψ| −a +c⟩| +a −c⟩
|⟨ψ| +a −c⟩|2 + |⟨ψ| −a +c⟩|2
.
This scheme leads to correlations
⟨ab⟩= ⟨bc⟩= ⟨ac⟩= −1.
Thus, we reproduce the result from [53] within the quantum formalism (see
AppendixA for detail):
max[−⟨ab⟩+ ⟨bc⟩+ ⟨ac⟩, ⟨ab⟩−⟨bc⟩+ ⟨ac⟩, ⟨ab⟩+ ⟨bc⟩−⟨ac⟩, −⟨ab⟩−⟨bc⟩−⟨ac⟩] = 3
We remark that this preparation of the projection type leads to correlation ±1 inde-
pendently of the initial mental state |ψ⟩. This is the good feature of this experimental
design: it is not easy (if possible at all) to prepare an ensemble of humans in the same
mental state (at least a pure state |ψ⟩).
This preparation step can generate signaling in the form of marginal inconsistency,
since the states |ψab⟩and |ψac⟩can lead to different marginal probability distributions
for the a-observable (see AppendixA for detail). Thus, the experimental design and
the statistical data collected in article [53] can be described in the quantum-like
framework. The contradiction between the results of [53] and the quantum formalism
is apparent.
In fact, consideration of three observables is not so interesting for the problem of
matching of the results of article [53] with quantum theory. The situation is delicate:
for three observables, one has to distinguish the original Bell inequality [60, 62] and
Suppes-Zanotti inequality (see [298] for details). Therefore, it is better to consider
four different meal courses [53], systems S1, S2, S3, S4. (A gourmand can create a
good gastronomic picture for this experiment; personally I am ﬁne with just the main
course, so my gastronomic creativity is very low.)
Observables on these systems are denoted as a1, b1, a2, b2. (We use these notation
to be closer to the quantum physics, the CHSH inequality. In the purely contextual
framework, one typically uses notation x1, x2, x3, x4, i.e., without underlining the
compound system structure.) We select the systems pairwise by creating the com-
pound systems and selecting pairwise joint observations on them:
S12 = (S1, S2), S32 = (S3, S2), S34 = (S3, S4), S14 = (S1, S4).
By keeping close to quantum physics observables are symbolized as (a1, b1),
(a2, b1), (a2, b2), (a1, b2).

306
17
Contextuality, Complementarity, and Bell Tests
On these compound systems, there are performed joint measurements of the cor-
responding pairs of observables. The maximal possible value= 4 for the CHSH
combination of correlations cannot be approached solely with the exclusion princi-
ple: the latter must be used for three pairs and, for the forth pair, Alice’s mental state
must be adjusted by H −H, L −L matching principle, e.g., the matching principle
is applied for the compound system S34 = (S3, S4) and the (a2, b2)-measurement is
preceded by state adjustment:
|ψ⟩→|ψa2b2⟩= ⟨ψ|Ha2 Hb2⟩|Ha2 Hb2⟩+ ⟨ψ|La2 Lb2⟩|La2 La2⟩
|⟨ψ|La2 Lb2⟩|2 + |⟨ψ|La2 Hb2⟩|2
≡⟨ψ| +a2 +b2⟩| +a2 +b2⟩+ ⟨ψ| −a2 −b2⟩| −a2 −b2⟩
|⟨ψ| +a2 +b2⟩|2 + |⟨ψ| −a2 −b2⟩|2
.
In article [53] the aforementioned pre-measurement state adjustments were not
highlighted. The exclusion principle was formulated in the non-contextual form:
Alice does not want both courses to be of high calorie or both to be low calorie.
Such pre-measurement preparation generates the entangled state
|ψ⟩= |H L⟩+ |L H⟩,
where the states |H⟩, |L⟩are context independent.
With this interpretation of the exclusion principle, in the quantum framework sig-
naling is impossible; it neither possible to exceed the Tsirelson bound 2
√
2. Thus,
the results of the experiment [53] might be interpreted as the conﬁrmation of impos-
sibility to represent some mental observables (in some mental contexts) as quantum
observables. (This position was emphasized by Basieva.) One should say that the
experiments [53] demonstrated that, not only the CP-model, but even the QP-model
of decision-making has its limits of applicability. In principle, this would not be
surprising. As was permanently repeated in this book, neither quantum physics nor
quantum(-like) cognition were derived from some fundamental and heuristically
attractive principles; the quantum formalism is applied, since it works. Signaling
and exceeding of the 2
√
2-bound are the strong arguments to claim that we can-
not proceed with quantum observables and that more general contextual probability
theories have to used (as, e.g., the Växjö model). Such models can generate both
signaling and exceeding of the 2
√
2-bound. This is the position of Basieva.
Personally, I do not supports this position. As was noted, the crucial role is
played by the exclusion principle and the way of its using by Alice in the pro-
cess of decision-making. Although this principle can be formulated in the context
independent form(as was suggested by Basieva), it seems that in the real mental
processing Alice adjusts this principle to the concrete measurement context, i.e., she
performs pre-measurement projection of her mental state |ψ⟩on context dependent
state |ψab⟩(for the (a, b) measurement).

17.12 Concluding Remarks on Cognitive Tests with Bell Inequalities

Thus, we discussed two opposite viewpoints on signaling and exceeding of the
Tsirelson bound in experiments presented in paper [53]:
1. They are signs of the restricted QP applicability in cognition, psychology, and
decision-making.
2. They can be modeled within quantum measurement theory by taking into account
the pre-measurement (context dependent) state projections.
Can one design an experiment which would distinguish aforementioned two posi-
tions?
The main question is whether Alice really performs the context dependent mental
state projection.
17.12
Concluding Remarks on Cognitive Tests with Bell
Inequalities
Another coauthor of article [53] Ehtibar Dzhafarov claimed that by using the coupling
method one does not need to appeal to QP at all (especially strongly this viewpoint
is expressed in article [139]). All cognitive phenomena can be described by CP.
Generally this is correct (cf. [266]). However, although coupling and conditioning
constructions are mathematically rigorous, they are not so attractive as QP which is a
linear space mental model. Another its advantageous property is the presence of the
unifying structure—a quantum state representing a mental (belief) state (see [285]
for an extended discussion).
Paper [53] describes a variety of choice experiments, i.e., not only the meal choice,
but also a shop choice and a space orientation experiments. All these experiments are
basedontheexclusion(ormatching)constraintsguarantyingentangledgeneration(in
the quantum framework). I interpret these constraints as mental state adjustments to
the concrete experimental situation corresponding to concrete pairs of questions. All
these experiments can be modeled within QP similarly to the meal choice experiment.
It seems that even the ﬁrst experiment [98] demonstrated the presence of “true
contextuality”, i.e., the violation of the CHSH-BDK inequality, can also be modeled
via quantum-like representation with context dependent state adjustment. However,
in article [98] this adjustment is not so straightforward as in later article [53]. And
more careful analysis is needed.
The common feature of the experiments suggested in [53, 98] is that, in fact,
people are asked the same question, say “High or low calorie?” But this question is
asked in different contexts. In my opinion, this is precisely the framework which we
have considered above, i.e., various state preparations.
Other objections of applicability of the quantum formalism to psychology will be
discussed in part 5.

Contextuality, Complementarity, and Bell Tests

Joint Measurement Contextuality
In quantum measurement theory, selection of observables co-measurable with an
observable
a
is
considered
as
speciﬁcation
of
measurement
context
of
a-measurements; the a-value in the b-context can differ from the a-value in the
c-context, for the same premeasurment state ψ. This is the essence of special contex-
tuality playing so important role in quantum information theory; in [298] we called
it joint measurement contextuality (JMC):
Deﬁnition 17.13.1 (JMC) If a, b, c are three quantum observables, such that a is
compatible with b and c, a measurement of a might give different result depending
upon whether a is measured with b or with c.
□
We note that contextual behavior corresponds to the case of incompatible quantum
observables b and c, i.e., there exist indexes such that [Eb
m, Ec
n] ̸= 0. If all observables
are pairwise commute, i.e., for all indexes [Ea
k , Eb
m] = [Ea
k , Ec
n] = [Eb
m, Ec
n] = 0,
then, for any state ψ, it is possible to construct the noncontextual model of measure-
ment based on the JPD for the triples of outcomes,
P(a = xk, b = ym, c = zn|ψ) = ∥Ea
k Eb
m Ec
nψ∥2 = · · · = ∥Ec
n Ea
k Eb
mψ∥2. (17.46)
If b and c are incompatible, such a model is impossible. This is the contextuality
scenario. However, JMC-contextuality formalized via above Deﬁnition cannot be
tested experimentally, since it involves counterfactual reasoning. The only possibility
is to test contextuality indirectly with the aid of Bell-type inequalities [60, 62].
If the sets of observables’ outcomes coincide with subsets of the real line, then
the above considerations can be essentially simpliﬁed—with the Hermitian linear
operators A, B, C representing observables. The contextuality scenario is related to
observables satisfying the commutation relations
[A, B] = [A, C] = 0, [B, C] ̸= 0.
(17.47)
However, the operator language is misleading and not only because representation
of outcomes by real numbers is too special for coming cognitive applications. The
main problem is that in the linear-operator approach the basic entities are outcomes,
eigenvalues of the operator-observable. The subspace Ha
x is constructed as the space
of the eigenvectors of the operator A corresponding to the eigenvalue x. In our
coming modeling, we proceed another way around. The basic structures are mutually
orthogonal subspaces Hk such that
H = ⊕kHk.
(17.48)
Then each of these subspaces is identiﬁed with some value of the PVM-observable
A given by projectors on these subspaces. Roughly speaking, ﬁrst states then values.

17.14 Contextual Resolution of Degeneration of Eigenvalues of Observables
309
17.14
Contextual Resolution of Degeneration
of Eigenvalues of Observables
JMC can be used to reduce degeneration of eigenvalues of observables. We shall
use this technique in Chap.7, to reduce degeneration of observables representing
mathematically conscious experiences.
Consider an observable a which is mathematically described as PVM (Ea(x))x∈X.
For the discrete set of observance’s values X = (xk), we use notation Ea
k . Suppose
now that some of projections Ea
k are degenerate; dim Ha
k > 1, where Ha
k = Ea
k H.
Moreover, for some outcomes, degeneration is very high, dim Ha
k >> 1. In this
case, a large set of states corresponds to the same outcome xk. Observer may be
unsatisﬁed by such a situation; observer wants to reﬁne his observation and split (at
least partially) the state space corresponding to the ﬁxed outcome. How can it be
done? The quantum measurement formalism presents the very natural and simple
procedure for reﬁnement of states’ structure.
Consider another quantum PVM-observable (Eb
m) compatible with the original
observable a, i.e., [Ea
k , Eb
m] = 0 for all indexes k, m (Chap.16, Sect.16.7). We
remark that b-observable has its own set of outcomes, Y = (ym), which need not
coincide with X.
For any (pure) quantum state ψ, the PVM-observables a and b are jointly mea-
surable with outcomes (xk, ym) and the join probability distribution
P(a = xk, b = ym|ψ) = ∥Ea
k Eb
mψ∥2 = ∥Eb
m Ea
k ψ∥2.
(17.49)
The projection postulate and commutativity of projectors imply that the post-
measurement state is the same for the joint measurement with outcome (xk, ym)
and sequential measurements, ﬁrst a = xk and then b = xm or vice verse. The post-
measurement state can be represented as follows
ψ →ψa=xk,b=xm =
Ea
k Eb
mψ
∥Ea
k Ebmψ∥=
Eb
m Ea
k ψ
∥Ebm Ea
k ψ∥.
(17.50)
The state space Ha
k is reduced to the space H(a,b)
km
= Ea
k Eb
mH(= Eb
m Es
kH); so
Ha
k = ⊕mH(a,b)
km
(17.51)
(direct sum decomposition). Thus, the observer can specify its post-observation state
much better.
The most fruitful reﬁnement is based on an observable with nondegenerate spec-
trum. Let all projectors Eb
m be one dimensional, dim Hb
m = 1, and let eb
m be the cor-
responding basis vector, i.e., Eb
meb
m = δ( j −m)eb
m. In this case, the outcome (xk, ym)
completely determines the post-observation mental state: ψ →eb
m. The correspon-
dence between labels (xk, ym) and post-measurement states is one-to-one.

310
17
Contextuality, Complementarity, and Bell Tests
Consider now another observable c which is also compatible with a, mathemat-
ically this is expressed as [Ea
k , Ec
n] = 0 for all k, n. The state spaces corresponding
to a-outcomes can also be reﬁned w.r.t. c-outcomes, i.e.,
Ha
k = ⊕mH(a,c)
km ,
(17.52)
where
H(a,c)
km
= Ea
k Ec
mH = Ec
m Es
kH.
In particular, if, for all n, dim Hc
n = 1 with the basis vector eb
m, i.e., Ec
jec
n = δ( j −
m)ec
n, then the outcome (xk, zn) completely determines the post-observation mental
state: ψ →ec
n.

Chapter 18
Quantum Statistics from
Indistinguishability
18.1
Thermodynamics from Gibbs Ideal Ensembles
As well as in our previous works [267, 269], here we follow Schrödinger’s book
[405] presenting the abstract scheme of the derivation of the basic thermodynam-
ical quantities from statistical mechanics for ensembles of distinguishable versus
indistinguishable systems. Schrödinger presented Gibbs’ approach based on ideal
ensembles of identical systems and extended it to quantum systems. In this way, he
obtained quantum statistics, both the Bose–Einstein and Fermi–Dirac cases, as well
as parastatistics.
Gibbs’ approach to thermodynamics differs crucially from the physical approach
of Maxwell and Boltzmann. Gibbs’ approach can be used in our mental modeling,
in contrast to the Maxwell–Boltzmann approach. To proceed with the latter, one
has to be sure that constraints imposed on physical gases can also be assumed for
“information gases”, in particular, “social gases”. The validity of these constraints
for nonphysical systems is not evident at all. The Maxwell–Boltzmann picture is
based on N actually existing physical systems in actual physical interaction with
each other, i.e., gas molecules or Planck oscillators in the corresponding quantum
generalization.
In Gibbs’ picture, N identical systems are mental copies of the one system under
consideration. What could it mean to distribute a given amount of energy between
these N mental copies? Schrödinger wrote [405], p. 3:
The idea is, in my view, that you can, of course, imagine that you really had N copies of
your system…Fixing your attention on one of them, you ﬁnd it in a peculiar kind of “heat
bath” which consists of the N −1 others.
The crucial point is that both pictures, the physical and mental ones, lead to the
same results, the same theory. Moreover, the mental picture is even easier adopted
to the quantum case (the main argument from which Schrödinger’s analysis was
initiated in [405]). By operating not with an ensemble of real systems, but with

Gibbsderivationofthebasicthermodynamicallawscanbefoundinbook[405]which

18.2
Distinguishable Systems: Classical Statistics
Consider an ensemble of N identical systems; each of them can be in one of the states
ψ1, . . . , ψk, . . . characterized by the corresponding energy levels E1, . . . , Ek, . . .
Here “energy” is any quantity with properties discussed in the previous section. The
state of an ensemble is determined by the indication that
• system no. 1 is in a state ψ j1,
• no. 2 in a state ψ j2, . . . ,
• system no. N in a state, say ψ jN .
Thus, a certain class of states of the ensemble will be indicated by saying that
n1, . . . , nk, . . . of the N systems are in the states ψ1, . . . , ψk, . . . It is important to
remark that n1, . . . , nk, . . . determine not a single state, but a class of states, precisely
because the systems in the ensemble are distinguishable.
The number of states belonging to this class is equal to
P = P(n1, . . . , nk, . . . |N, E) =
N!
n1!n2! . . . nk! . . .
(18.1)
with the two constraints

i
ni = N,

i
ni Ei = E,
(18.2)
where N is the number of systems in the ensemble and E is the total energy of this
ensemble.
Gibbs’ method is based on the following argument. If N is very large, ideally
inﬁnitely large, then practically all states will belong to the class of states corre-
sponding to the maximal value of P. By taking into account the constraints (18.2)
and using the Lagrange multipliers λ and β for these constraints we obtain

i
eλ−βEi = N,

i
Eieλ−βEi = E.
(18.3)
We form the partition function, the statistical sum over states:
Z =

i
e−βEi.
(18.4)

18.3 Indistinguishable Systems: Quantum Statistics
313
Then the ﬁrst multiplier can be easily found:
λ = ln(N/Z).
This is just the normalization factor. The second multiplier plays more important
role. It can be connected with average energy per a system in the ensemble:
U = E/N = 1
Z

i
Eie−βEi = −∂ln Z
∂β
.
(18.5)
However, in general the functional dependence β = β(U) is very complex. There-
fore,inthermodynamicsoneassignsthedirectmeaningtoβ asinversetotemperature,
β = 1/T,
and then typically the average energy is expressed as a function of temperature,
U = U(T ).
Invention of temperature is based on considerations leading to a possibility to operate
with thermometer. In physics, such considerations are justiﬁed.
Proceeding pragmatically we just treat the parameter β as representing the
average energy per system in the ensemble of N systems with the energy levels
(E1, . . . , Ek, . . .), see also Sect.18.3.
By using (18.3) we also obtain that the average number of systems per energy
level is given by
¯nk = nk
N = e−βEk
Z
.
(18.6)
It is convenient to represent it in the form
¯nk = −1
β
∂ln Z
∂Ek
.
(18.7)
This set of equations indicates the distribution of the N systems over their energy
level Schrödinger remarked [405], p. 8:
It may be said to contain, in nutshell, the whole of thermodynamics.
18.3
Indistinguishable Systems: Quantum Statistics
Consider a system which is composed of m indistinguishable subsystems. Compound
system will be denoted by S and its subsystems by S with indexes. It is assumed that
an observer can assign to all systems some quantity called energy and satisfying the

314
18
Quantum Statistics from Indistinguishability
additivity requirement with respect to its distribution over subsystems of a system.
We shall denote the energy of S by E and the energy of S by E. These quantities
should not be interpreted as objective properties of systems. Energy E = E(S) can
be assigned to S as the output of observation performed by an observer on S. The
same interpretation is used for energy E = E(S) assigned to S.
As always derivation of thermodynamical quantities from ensemble statistics is
started with construction of partition function Z. The possible energy levels of a
subsystem S are denoted by E1, . . . , E j, . . .. An energy level Ek of m-particle com-
pound system S is characterized by a sequence of natural numbers m1, . . . , m j, . . .
of subsystems on the corresponding levels. The latter means “subsystems with mea-
surement outputs” E1, . . . , E j, . . .. Here it is crucial that subsystems with the same
value of energy E j are not distinguished one from another. This indistinguishability
determines the form of Z and, hence, all thermodynamical quantities. In chapters
on social lasing and Fröhlich condensate, we have always emphasized that indistin-
guishability of systems is w.r.t. to one or a few observables. Deeper inspection can
show that in fact the systems under consideration are distinguishable w.r.t. to other
parameters. But it is assumed that such supplementary parameters (“distinguishabil-
ity parameters”) are not involved in the processes under consideration.
We have
Ek =

s
Esms.
(18.8)
Thus, the partition function is given by the sum
Z =

(ms)
e−β 
s Esms,
(18.9)
where symbol (ms) denotes an admissible set of numbers ms. For the moment, β > 0
is just a parameter of the model, a Lagrange multiplier.
From ln Z, it is possible to deduce the basic thermodynamical quantities; in par-
ticular, the average value of ms
¯ms = −1
β
∂ln Z
∂Es
.
(18.10)
Now, different statistics for systems composed of indistinguishable subsystems
can be obtained by consideration of different possible ranges of values of natural
numbers ms:
1. ms = 0, 1, 2, . . . . (Bose–Einstein statistics),
2. ms = 0, . . . , q, where q ≥1 is a natural number (parastatistics).
In physics, q = 1, i.e., ms = 0, 1; this is the case of the Fermi–Dirac statistics.
We remark that in quantum physics selection of the Fermi–Dirac statistics from a
bunch of parastistics is just postulated. Of course, it is conﬁrmed by the experimental

18.4 Classical and Quantum statistics
315
situation. One cannot exclude that in social science parastistics with q > 1 can ﬁnd
applications.
By restricting considerations to the Bose–Einstein and Fermi–Dirac statistics and
following Schrödinger [405], we ﬁnd that the corresponding partition functions can
be expressed as
Z = ZBE =

s
1
1 −e−βEs , Z = ZFD =

s
(1 + e−βEs).
(18.11)
This leads to the following basic expression for the average value of ms
¯ms =
1
1
ξ eβEs ∓1
(18.12)
where 0 < ξ ≤1 is so called parameter of degeneration, ξ = ξ(m). We remark that,
for photons, ξ = 1, with the Bose–Einstein statistics.
Then one gets the average energy as
U =

s
αs

ξ eβEs ∓1.
(18.13)
18.4
Classical and Quantum statistics
The mathematical laws describing the average number of systems are presented on
Fig.18.1. These are very special mathematical laws. By considering gases composed
of physical systems, by Boltzmann–Maxwell approach, one may think that these laws
are speciﬁed by physics: the Maxwell–Boltzmann law for classical gases and the
Bose–EinsteinandFermi–Diracstatisticsforquantumgases.However,ourderivation
(in Gibbs’ framework) of formulas (18.6) and (18.12) has nothing to do with physical
laws. It is based on consideration of distinguishable versus indistinguishable systems
of any origin. Such a combinatorial derivation makes the origin of the forms of the
graphs presented at Fig.18.1 really mystical. Why is statistical behavior restricted
only to such forms? Can one ﬁnd some statistical behavior with a graph “in-between”
the graphs corresponding to the Maxwell–Boltzmann, Bose–Einstein, and Fermi–
Dirac statistics?1
What are additional constraints, different from distinguishability, which can
induce new natural forms of statistical dependence on energy?
1 We remark that consideration of the parastatistics does not bring us really new mathematical laws.
The parastatistics graphs are simple modiﬁcations of the graph for the Fermi–Dirac statistics.

In physics it is proven, both theoretically and experimentally, that only the
Maxwell–Boltzmann, Bose–Einstein, and Fermi–Dirac statistics are realizable in
nature. However, for social systems, other forms of statistical dependence
f (ϵ) = ⟨n⟩(ϵ)
may appear. Of course, we are still mainly theorizing, because experimental veriﬁ-
cation of nonclassical statistics in social data, (say even the Bose–Einstein statistics
for social energy in information ﬂows) has not yet even started.

Part VII
Supplement on Decision-Making
This part contains three chapters supplementary to the previous chapters on decision-
making. The ﬁrst chapter is devoted to classical expected utility theory with contex-
tual structuring of its paradoxes. The second chapter is about a few interpretations
of quantum state and probability. If a reader is an atheist, then the third chapter can
be either ignored or God can be treated as a kind of universal observer.

Classical Expected Utility Theory

19.1
Von Neumann and Morgenstern: Expected Utility
Theory
There are two lots, say A = (xi, Pi) and B = (yi, Qi), where (xi) and (yi) are
outcomes and (Pi) and (Qi) are probabilities of these outcomes.
Which lot do you select?
An agent, say Alice, can simulate the experience that she draws the lot A (or
B) and gets the outcome xi (or yi). Let us represent such an event by (A, xi) (or
(B, yi)). As usual, Alice assigns the utilities u(xi) and u(yi) of (A, xi) and (B, yi),
respectively. Here, u(x) is a utility function of outcome x.1 By using the utility
function, the agent evaluates various comparisons for making the preference:
A ⪰B or B ⪰A.
The ﬁrst mathematically consistent theory of decision-making was expected utility
theory (von Neumann and Morgenstern [450]) based on the axioms: Complete-
ness, Transitivity, Independence, Continuity. The axioms are given for the rela-
tion of utilities like u ⪰v and the operation using probability like pu + (1 −p)v.
This motivates an agent to operate with the expected utilities, EA =  u(xi)Pi and
EB =  u(yi)Qi, and to use their difference as the criterion for making the prefer-
ence.
1 In the classical model the utility of an event depends on only its outcome. However, in the quantum-
like model utility has the complex Hilbert space representation encoding all circumstances of
realization of outcomes.

19.2
Allais Paradox
We consider one of the versions of the Allais paradox [7]. Here we follow [467] with
one modiﬁcation, namely, using the word “context”, instead of the word “situation”.
From the ﬁrst view, this modiﬁcation is innocent, but it gives the possibility to include
this paradox in the general contextual structure of the foundational experiments of
quantum physics [251] (Chap.17). Let us consider two gambling contexts each is
based on two lotteries. Let there be outcomes consisting of only losing money.
Context C1:
• Lottery A1: loss of $500 with probability 100%;
• Lottery B1: equal probabilities of losing $1000 or $0.
Context C2:
• Lottery A2: 10% chance of losing $500 and a 90% chance of losing $0;
• Lottery B2: 5% chance of losing $1000 and a 95% chance of losing $0.
We calculate the expected utilities for all lotteries.
Context C1:
• Lottery A1 : EA1 = u(−$500).
• Lottery B1 : EB1 = 0.5u(−$1000) + 0.5u($0).
Context C2:
• Lottery A2 : EA2 = 0.1u(−$500) + 0.9u($0).
• Lottery B2 : EB2 = 0.05u(−$1000) + 0.95u($0).
Often people prefer lottery A1 to lottery B1 in context C1 and lottery B2 to lottery
A2 in context C2.2 Hence, for these people,
• Context C1: EA1 = u(−$500) > EB1 = 0.5u(−$1000) + 0.5u($0).
• ContextC2: EA2 = 0.1u(−$500) + 0.9u($0) < EB2 = 0.05u(−$1000) + 0.95u($0).
After such calculations, one typically makes the following statement. “Two contexts
have the same structure, which causes a paradox:”
0.1u(−$500) < 0.05u(−$1000) + 0.05u($0)
(19.1)
In literature on decision-making, this situation is typically treated as resulting from
ambiguity aversion (uncertainty aversion): roughly speaking, people are afraid of
uncertainty.
However, I prefer the contextual explanation of the origin of this paradox. There
are considered two different gambling contexts, C1 and C2. It is natural to assume
that they generate two different utility functions uC1 and uC2. By operating with
different functions one can proceed without paradoxes. However, operation with
2 Numerous experimental studies were performed in cognitive psychology and economics. In this
book, we do not discuss the concrete experiments.

19.3 Savage: Subjective Expected Utility Theory
321
a context-dependent utility function is more natural for subjective expected utility
theory which will be considered in the next section.
Contextuality plays the crucial role in a few models described in this book (see,
e.g., Chaps.6, 7, 17). Contextuality matches well the foundations and formalism of
quantum theory (Chap.17). The quantum-like models of expected utility developed
in articles [248, 282] can be treated as reﬂecting contextuality of the utility function
and probability.
Further paragraph can be difﬁcult for readers unfamiliar with contextuality in
quantum physics. It might be useful to start with reading Chap.17.
The “trick” leading to the paradox is the same as in quantum physics in theoretical
and experimental studies of the violation of the Bell inequality [251]. What is wrong
fromtheexperimentalviewpoint?AsintheBellexperiments,statisticaldatacollected
in different experiments is put in the same probabilistic model, i.e., the same Kol-
mogorov probability space [318] P = (, F , P), where  is the space of elementary
events and P is a probability measure on σ-algebra of events. In applications of this
model (CP), observers are represented by random variables on P. However, both
in physics and decision-making the multi-contextual experimental situation doesn’t
guarantee that such single Kolmogorov probability space description is possible.
Following the Växjö model [251] (Sect.17.2), one should operate with a family of
context-dependent probability spaces, PC = (C, FC, PC). Observables are given
by random variables on contextually-labeled probability spaces, measurable func-
tions, aC : C →R. The same semantically deﬁned observable a is represented by
a family of random variables (aC) the family of contexts for which the a-observable
can be measured. In the Allais paradox, the role of observable is played by the utility
function u. As was noted, it has to be context-labeled. Similar contextual descrip-
tion can be provided in the framework of Contextuality by Default (CBD) theory
developed by Dzhafarov et al. (see, e.g., [131] and Sect.17.8).
19.3
Savage: Subjective Expected Utility Theory
As we have seen, the expected utility theory is not free of paradoxes, the most
widely known is the Allais paradox [7]. This problem is fundamentally coupled to
the interpretation of probability used in expected utility theory. The latter is based
on the frequency (statistical) interpretation of probability.
Therefore it is natural to test models of decision-making based on other interpre-
tations. The most powerful alternative to the frequency probability is the subjective
probability. The subjective probability is the measure of belief about whether a spe-
ciﬁc outcome is likely to occur. The subjective modiﬁcation of expected utility theory
was performed by Savage [400] who suggested to consider both utility and proba-
bility as subjectively determined by decision makers. However, as we see in the next
section even the subjective expected utility theory is not free of paradoxes.

19.4
Ellsberg Paradox
The Ellsberg paradox [144] is a challenge for subjective expected utility theory [400].
In the simple decision-making framework—selection of a lottery—people behave in
contrary with subjective expected utility theory.
Two Urns Paradox
Let us consider the two urns version of this paradox. Take two urns, call them urn1
and urn2, containing the equal number of balls, say 100 balls. Decision makers are
informed that urn1 contains 50 red and 50 black balls, but urn2 contains mixture of red
and black balls in unknown proportion. Hence, for urn1, P(red) = P(black) = 1/2,
but for urn2 these probabilities are unknown. In decision-making with subjective
probabilities the latter two probabilities are assigned by decision maker subjectively.
Any participant of the selection experiment is offered the following bets
• Lottery A1: get $1 if a red ball is drawn from urn urn1, $0 otherwise.
• Lottery A2: get $1 if a black ball is drawn from urn urn1, $0 otherwise.
• Lottery B1: get $1 if a red ball is drawn from urn urn2, $0 otherwise.
• Lottery B2: get $1 a if black ball is drawn from urn urn2, $0 otherwise.
In such experiments typically people are indifferent between lotteries A1 and A2
and this is consistent with expected utility theory. But they strictly prefer A1 to B1
and A2 to B2 and this contradicts to subjective expected utility theory. This situation
can be treated as resulting from ambiguity aversion (uncertainty aversion): people
are afraid of uncertainty.
Now let us perform contextual structuring of this gambling. Consider three gam-
bling contexts.
Context C1:
• Lottery A1: get $1 if a red ball is drawn from urn urn1, $0 otherwise.
• Lottery A2: get $1 if a black ball is drawn from urn urn1, $0 otherwise.
Context C2:
• Lottery A1: get $1 if a red ball is drawn from urn urn1, $0 otherwise.
• Lottery B1: get $1 if a red ball is drawn from urn urn2, $0 otherwise.
Context C3:
• Lottery A2: get $1 if a black ball is drawn from urn urn1, $0 otherwise.
• Lottery B2: get $1 if a black ball is drawn from urn urn2, $0 otherwise.
Alice should make the decisions and compare the lotteries in three different con-
texts and if she operates with contextual utility functions her decisions would
not lead to a paradox. Moreover, subjective probabilities P(red from urn2|C2) and

19.4 Ellsberg Paradox
323
P(red from urn2|C3) = 1 −P(black from urn2|C3) do not need coincide. So, this is
contextuality of probability (cf. [251]). However, subjective utility theory is not con-
textual in this sense. The quantum-like models of subjective expected utility [248,
282] reﬂect contextuality. We remark that quantum contextuality becomes visible
only for entangled belief states.
One Urn Paradox
Let us now consider the one-urn paradox. The urn contains 90 balls: 30 balls are red
and 60 balls are either black or yellow in unknown proportions. Hence, P(red) =
1/3, but P(black) and P(yellow) are unknown. In decision-making with subjective
probabilities, the latter two probabilities are assigned by decision maker subjectively.
The participants then should select one of the following gambling scenarios:
• Lottery A: get $100 if a red ball is drawn.
• Lottery B: get $100 if black ball is drawn.
Additionally, the participant may choose a separate gamble scenario within the same
situational parameters:
• Lottery C: get $100 if a red or yellow ball is drawn.
• Lottery D: get $100 if a black or yellow ball is drawn.
By subjective expected utility theory the choice between gambles is based on
comparison of expected utilities between them. The latter depends on subjective
assignments of P(black) and P(yellow). Alice does not need to assign exact values
to them. It is sufﬁcient to estimate them comparing with probability P(red). It is
important to note that expected utility is calculated individually for each game.
In this example the utility is the same in all lotteries, u($100), hence expected
utility is determined by probabilities—their subjective determination. Alice strictly
prefers lottery A to lottery B if and only if she assumes that P(red) > P(black). The
latter implies that P(yellow) > P(black) and since P(black) + P(yellow) = 2/3,
then P(yellow) > 1/3, Hence, P(red or yellow) > 2/3 = P(black or yellow), i.e.,
Alice should prefer lottery C to lottery D.
However, ambiguity aversion would predict that people would strictly prefer lot-
tery A to lottery B, and lottery D to lottery C. Numerous experimental studies
conﬁrmed this prediction.
Once again I do not support the hypothesis that people suffer of ambiguity aver-
sion. We can repeat contextuality story presented for previous paradoxes.
Quantum-like models of subjective expected utility were developed in articles
[27, 282]. In this book, we don’t want to go into technical details. We just point
to the key point of the quantum-like models: to go beyond the classical subjective
utility theory, Alice’s belief state ψ has to be entangled w.r.t. to lotteries’ choices. If
ψ is separable, the quantum-like model reproduces the classical situation.

Classical Expected Utility Theory and Its Paradoxes
19.5
Quantum-Like Modeling of Subjective Expected
Utility
Consider the space of belief states of an agent (Chap.2). In accordance with the
quantum-like modeling of cognition belief states are represented by normalized vec-
tors of a complex Hilbert space H. These are so-called pure states. More generally,
belief states are represented by density operators encoding classical probabilistic
mixtures of pure states.
Lotteries A and B are mathematically realized as two orthonormal bases in H :
(|ia⟩) and (| jb⟩). Any vector |ia⟩represents the event (A, xi)—“selecting of the
A-lottery which generates the outcome xi.” The same can be said about vectors of
the B-basis. These events are not real, but imaginable. Alice plays with potential
outcomes of the lotteries and compares them.
We can also represent lotteries by Hermitian operators, the lotteries operators:
A =

i
xi |ia⟩⟨ia|, B =

j
y j | jb⟩⟨jb|.
(19.2)
As in the classical theory, each outcome xi has some utility ui = u(xi) (say amount
of money). Thus our model is based on a mapping from eigenstates of the “lottery-
operators” to utilities (amounts of money),
|ia⟩→u(xi), | jb⟩→u(y j).
Thus, starting with two lotteries A and B with outcomes (xi) and (y j) with corre-
sponding utilities ui = u(xi) and u j = u(y j), Alice represents these utilities (cou-
pled to their lotteries) by two orthonormal bases in the belief-state space H:
ui →|ia⟩, u j →| jb⟩.
(19.3)
We emphasize coupling of utilities to lotteries. Utility (derived from some mon-
etary amount) has not only the value, but also so to say the “color” determined
by circumstances surrounding the corresponding lottery—lottery’s context. There-
fore even the same outcome z = xi = y j of two lotteries (having the same utility
value u = u(z)) may be represented by two different vectors: |ia⟩̸= | jb⟩. More-
over, outcomes inside each lottery are also coupled through selection of the ﬁxed
orthonormal basis. Finally, we remark that mapping (19.3) encodes the correlations
between outcomes of lotteries (and their utilities). These correlations are mathemat-
ically expressed through quantum transition probabilities.
The lotteries operators can be noncommuting, i.e., [A, B] ̸= 0. In quantum the-
ory noncommuting Hermitian operators represent complementary (or incompatible)
observables: they cannot be measured jointly. In our quantum-like model of lottery
selection, we can speak about complementary lotteries which are represented by non-
commuting operators. In the DM-process for complementary lotteries, Alice does

19.5 Quantum-Like Modeling of Subjective Expected Utility
325
not create the joint image of outcomes of both of them. In mathematical terms the
latter means the impossibility to determine the joint probability distribution for the
pairs of outcomes (xi, y j). Thus, instead of weighting probabilistically the pairs of
outcomes, Alice analyzes the possibility of realization of an outcome say xi of the
A-lottery and she accounts for its utility u(xi). Then under the assumption of such
realization she imagines possible realizations (y j) of the B-lottery and compares the
utilities u(y j) and u(xi).
Suppose I have selected the A-lottery and its outcome xi was realized. What would be my
earning (lost) if (instead) I were selected the B-lottery and its outcome y j were realized?
This kind of counterfactual reﬂections is mathematically described by the Hilbert
space formalism and transition from the A-basis to the B-basis. Outputs of these com-
parisons are weighted through accounting Hilbert space coordinates. This accounting
is described by the special comparison operator D. Since Alice cannot handle both
lotteries simultaneously, she starts with imaging one of them say A, as in the above
consideration. Then she performs similar counterfactual reasoning starting with the
B-lottery. The comparison operator D has two counterparts representing the pro-
cesses A →B and B →A comparisons. In the operator terms, transitions from
one basis to another are represented by transition operators Eia→jb, E jb→ia. And
the comparison operator D is compounded of these operators. See [282] for further
development of theory.

Belief State Interpretation
20.1
The Spirit of Copenhagen
As was already pointed out, the problem of the quantum state (wave function) inter-
pretation and more generally the interpretation of the mathematical formalism of
quantum theory is one of the main foundational problems. The debates on it are
characterized by controversy. As the organizer of the Växjö series of quantum foun-
dations conferences (2000–2022), I can’t see any sign of opinion convergence to a
kind of the universal interpretation (see, e.g., proceedings [3, 111, 235, 237, 257,
258] and my monographs [250, 271]). Typically an expert would say that he pro-
ceeds with the Copenhagen interpretation. But my experience based on hundreds
of discussions with world’s leading experts show that practically everybody has his
own picture of Copenhagen. Arkady Plotnitsky described this situation at the second
Växjö conference in 2001 (see [378]); in his recent book [385] he wrote:
- Bohr’s interpretation, in any of its versions, will be distinguished in this study from “the
Copenhagen interpretation,” because there is no single such interpretation, as even Bohr
has changed his a few times. It is more suitable to speak, as Heisenberg did [197], of “the
Copenhagen spirit of quantum theory” or, as a handier shorthand, “the spirit of Copenhagen,”
referring to certain common features of a group of interpretations, which may be different
in their other features.
As well as formulas in CP [231, 250], the probability in the Born formula (2.5) can
be interpreted either statistically or subjectively. However, in QP the interpretation
problem is more complicated, because QP operates not solely with probabilities, but
also with quantum states. Hence, not only probabilities, but also states have to be
interpreted and the state-probability interpretation should be consistent.

Belief State Interpretation
20.2
Interpretations: Statistical Versus Individual
By the statistical interpretation of probability, for a large ensemble of decision makers
(N persons), the frequency of observation of the output a = α approaches (for N →
∞) the probability calculated theoretically with the Born rule:
νN(α) = nN(α)/N ≈∥E(α)ψ∥2,
(20.1)
where nN(α) is the number of decision makers who answered a = α. This inter-
pretation is the most useful to couple theory and experiment (see [231, 250] for
the frequency interpretation of probability). In cognitive, psychological, social, and
ﬁnancial experiments statistical data is collected for an ensemble of humans (or
animals).
In quantum physics, this interpretation of probability is coupled to the statistical
interpretation of the wave function by which it represents not the state of an individ-
ual quantum system, but of an ensemble of systems prepared by the same prepara-
tion procedure. This interpretation is typically associated with Einstein, latter it was
highlighted by Ballentine [43]. In decision theory, by the statistical interpretation the
belief state is associated with a large ensemble of decision makers which is selected
under special conditions—a decision-making preparation procedure.
Bohr and von Neumann assigned the wave function to an individual quantum sys-
tem. However, for probability they used the statistical interpretation. This interplay
of individual (for state) and statistical (for probability associated with this state by
the Born rule) interpretations made the statistical structure of QM really mystical.
This mystery would be resolved only via the solution of the quantum measurement
problem: creation of a mathematical model for generation of the concrete outputs of
the observable A on the basis of the initial state ψ. This is the complicated problem
and maybe it could not be solved at all within quantum theory. Nevertheless, the
individual interpretation of quantum state combined with the statistical interpreta-
tion probability is widely used in QM. It is reasonable to use this framework even in
cognition, decision-making, and other applications outside of physics.
By this interpretation the belief (mental) state ψ is assigned to the individual deci-
sion maker, but it determines the statistical probability for an ensemble of decision
makers who have the same state ψ. Why does ψ generates the statistical probability
which is experimentally veriﬁable (see (20.1)) with the frequency of observations
νN(α j)? This question would be replied if within quantum-like modeling one would
solve the measurement problem:
How does brain generate the concrete output a = x j starting with the mental
state ψ?

20.3 QBism: Subjective Interpretation
329
20.3
QBism: Subjective Interpretation
By the subjective interpretation of probability Alice (whose belief state is ψ) assigns
her own weight P(a = α) to the outcome a = α and in the quantum-like model of
decision-making this subjective probability is given by the Born rule, i.e., P(a =
α) = P(a = α|ψ).
In general decision theory (i.e., not directly related to quantum experiments), the
subjective interpretation of probability is widely applied to a variety of problems,
including the framework of the subjective utility function. In the quantum-like refor-
mulation, the Born rule gives subjective probabilities which decision makers assign
to possible outcomes (see [27] for the quantum-like subjective utility model).
In quantum physics the subjective interpretation of probability is associated with
Quantum Baeysianism (QBism), see, e.g., [163–168] (see also [109, 279, 280] for
discussions on QBism). We start with the following citation of Fuchs and Schack
[166], pp. 3–4:
The fundamental primitive of QBism is the concept of experience. According to QBism,
quantum mechanics is a theory that any agent can use to evaluate her expectations for the
content of her personal experience.
QBism adopts the personalist Bayesian probability theory ... . This means that QBism inter-
prets all probabilities, in particular those that occur in quantum mechanics, as an agent’s
personal, subjective degrees of belief. This includes the case of certainty - even probabilities
0 or 1 are degrees of belief. ...
In QBism, a measurement is an action an agent takes to elicit an experience. The measurement
outcome is the experience so elicited. The measurement outcome is thus personal to the
agent who takes the measurement action. In this sense, quantum mechanics, like probability
theory, is a single user theory. A measurement does not reveal a pre-existing value. Rather,
the measurement outcome is created in the measurement action.
According to QBism, quantum mechanics can be applied to any physical system. QBism
treats all physical systems in the same way, including atoms, beam splitters, Stern–Gerlach
magnets, preparation devices, measurement apparatuses, all the way to living beings and
other agents. In this, QBism differs crucially from various versions of the Copenhagen
interpretation. ...
An agent’s beliefs and experiences are necessarily local to that agent. This implies that the
question of nonlocality simply does not arise in QBism.
What is about the QBism-interpretation of the belief state?
This is the theory about structuring the individual’s experiences in the situation
of uncertainty. The belief state ψ is individual’s state. Hence, ψ is not the state of
say an electron involved in the process of measurement, but of an experimenter who
creates the subjective probabilistic picture for possible outcomes of this experiment.
In discussions on QBism, it is typically missed that it diminishes the role of
the quantum state. QBists suggest to operate solely with probabilities. To realize this
approach, they consider not standard quantum observables which are mathematically
represented by Hermitian operators, but generalized observables which completely
determine a quantum state—informationally complete POVMs. Such observables

330
20
Belief State Interpretation
have n2 outcomes, where n is the state space dimension. Another property is that
the outcomes are not mutually exclusive, i.e., projections corresponding to differ-
ent values are not mutually orthogonal. Any quantum state, pure or mixed, can be
represented as the vector with n2 coordinates given by probabilities for observation
outcomes (for this state). Hence, QBists are able to eliminate the complex Hilbert
state space from consideration and represent the quantum formalism as the purely
probabilistic machinery that is used for probability update—quantum Bayesian infer-
ence. Of course, the price is very high:
• model’s dimension is squared,
• the basic observables are not von Neumann projection type observables, but gen-
eralized observables—symmetric informationally complete POVMs,1
• FTP derived within QBism is totally different from FTP of CP.
My intention is that in quantum-like modeling one can use the QBism method-
ology, the personal experience viewpoint on outcomes of observations and on prob-
ability. However, the notion of the personal belief state has to be used as the seed
for generation of subjective probabilities. The QBism’s program to reformulate the
quantum formalism solely in terms of probability played the important role in quan-
tum foundations, in particular, for demystiﬁcation of quantum mechanics. However,
in real applications the conventional quantum formalism with the Hilbert state space
is more convenient, both in physics and decision-making.
We continue the discussion on QBism in Sects. 21.2 and 21.3.
20.4
Växjö Interpretation
By the Växjö interpretation [236, 245] the quantum formalism is the machinery for
the probability update. The essence of this interpretation is representation of the
QP-update similarly to the classical update. Originally in the quantum formalism
the probability update is a derivative of the quantum state update. Reference to a
complex vector to express the update of the real probability mystiﬁes this procedure.
By the Växjö interpretation, one can reformulate the QP-update scheme in purely
probabilistic terms. The key element of this CP-like representation is the quantum
FTP (with the interference term).
In this sense, i.e., in attempting to demystify the QP-update by representing it
in CP-like way, the Växjö interpretation is close to QBism. But the corresponding
quantum versions of classical FTP are totally different.
The FTP with the interference term (1.11) used in the Växjö interpretation is
just an additive perturbation of CP-FTP. The interference term δ can be considered
as a parameter describing correspondence between QP and CP; when δ →0, the
1 Even in physics, to perform measurements of observables described by these POVMs is a difﬁcult
task. In biological and cognitive applications, nobody even tried to do measurements of such type.

20.4 Växjö Interpretation
331
quantum FTP is smoothly transformed into the classical FTP. QBism’s analog of
FTP cannot be related to the classical FTP in this way. QBism’s FTP is a kind of
singulare perturbation of the classical FTP.
Similarly to QBism the Växjö interpretation demystiﬁes quantum theory, by por-
traying it as the special machinery for the probability update. In contrast to QBism,
in physics the Växjö interpretation treats probabilities statistically. In quantum-like
modeling they can be treated subjectively as well.

Chapter 21
God as Decision Maker and Quantum
Bayesianism
21.1
Bohr Versus Bell
The recent quantum information revolution (known as the second quantum revolu-
tion) had strong impact to foundations of quantum mechanics and natural science in
general. It featured the role of information in physics; physical laws can be treated as
describing consistent transformation of information corresponding to different exper-
imental contexts. Thus the role of physical carriers of information was substantially
diminished and the reductionist viewpoint to physics was faded.
This information interpretation of quantum mechanics matches well with the
views of Niels Bohr who repeatably pointed out that quantum mechanics is not about
micro-reality as it is, but about measurements procedures giving the possibility to
extract knowledge concerning these systems with the aid of measurement devices.
Moreover, in his complementarity principle he stressed that measurements outputs
are not objective properties of microsystems, but generated in the process complex
interaction between an apparatus and a system. These Bohr’s views are known as
the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics. One can consider this inter-
pretation as highlighting the role of the observer, the human component of quantum
theory. In particular, Wigner proceeded in this direction, but his views are not so
widely accepted. In particular, the interpretations of the foundational experiments
on quantum nonlocality, via demonstration of violation of the Bell inequality, highly
depend on the problem of human’s free will. Denying the existence of the latter leads
to the interpretation known as superdeteminism: everything is predetermined from
the moment of the Big Bang, creation of the universe. Keeping to this interpretation
is the easiest way to resolve the problem of nonlocality. Superdeterminism leads
to the local viewpoint on quantum mechanics. By saying that humans have the free
will, one confronts a number of complicated foundational and philosophic problems.
Declaring that quantum mechanics is nonlocal is the simplest way to solve them.
However, there is another way to interpret consistently the Bell-type experiments
within the free will paradigm. Scientists who accept that observer has free will (at
least to choose experimental settings) and suggest the probabilistic resolution of the

problem of nonlocality are known as the probability opposition to the nonlocal inter-
pretation of quantum phenomena (see [288, 292] for the corresponding references).
Careful treatment of probabilities involved in the Bell experiments gives the possibil-
ity to proceed without referring to mystical quantum nonlocality and spooky action at
a distance [286]. The main issue is contextual dependence of probabilities and exis-
tence of incompatible observables corresponding to complementary experimental
contexts—complexes of physical conditions (Chap.17).
21.2
Supplement on Quantum Bayesianism (QBism)
In the contextual playing with the quantum foundations, it can be relevant to go
further and include even an observer into the experimental context. This approach
lifts the role of human being and his mind in quantum theory. And this is the ideology
of Quantum Bayesianism (QBism) displaying the role of the personal experience of
an observer. Since such experiences are local, QBism easily resolves the problem of
quantum nonlocality and this is one of its strong sides. QBism essentially demystiﬁes
quantum mechanics. On the other hand, for it is not so easy, if possible at all, for
typical physicist, to recognize the need to involve the subjective element in the
quantum foundations.
I, personally, can be compared with two faced Janus:
• In physics I stay on the position of aforementioned physicists. It is difﬁcult to
accept the need of the personal experiences of observers to make the quantum
foundations consistent. QBists kill the monster of quantum nonlocality, but at the
same time welcome human as the basic component of quantum theory. Even the
treatment of quantum probabilities as subjective ones is in controversy with my
intuition. For me these probabilities are statistical. Often Bayesianism—the prob-
ability update machinery including Bayesian inference—is rigidly coupled with
the subjective interpretation of probability. However, this is not the case. In CP, the
same mathematical formalism (Kolmogorov 1933 [318]) can be applied for prob-
abilities interpreted both statistically and subjectively. Kolmogorov explored the
statistical interpretation. In QP, genuine quantum Bayesianism is the machinery
for the quantum state update and the latter generates the QP update. As well as in
CP, this machinery can be endowed both with the statistical and subjective inter-
pretations. I am in favor of the statistical one and according to my experience and
intuition measurement is done by a physical apparatus and human’s involvement
cannot play the crucial role in theory about quantum measurements,
• In cognition and decision making I completely share the views of QBists—
associationofoutcomesofobservationswiththepersonalexperiencesofobservers.
However, observations are here self-observations, as was described in Chaps.6,
7. In Bohr’s manner, they can be represented as observations performed by con-
sciousness over unconsciousness. Personal experiences of decision maker are con-
scious experiences generated via interaction of unconscious and conscious mental

21.3 QBism Versus Copenhagen Interpretation
335
states. Probabilities are subjective probabilities of decision maker, typically they
are assigned unconsciously. Moreover, these subjective probabilities have the sta-
tistical nature and generated by neural networks in the brain, as it was described
in Chap.6.
Now we turn to QBism foundations. The essence of QBism is presented by one
of its founders Christopher A. Fuchs [169] in the following words:
QBism ...takes the idea of “the instruments of observation as a . . . prolongation of the sense
organs of the observer’ deadly seriously and runs it to its logical conclusion. This is why
QBists opt to say that the outcome of a quantum measurement is a personal experience for
the agent gambling upon it. Whereas Bohr always had his classically describable measuring
devices mediating between the registration of a measurement’s outcome and the individual
agent’s experience, for QBism the outcome just is the experience.
Quantum theory is a statistical theory and it predicts probabilities of experimental
outcomes. The aforementioned lifting of the role of observer is the basis of the
subjective QP interpretation in QBism [169, 170].
A quantum state in QBism is just a state of belief of an observer on possible
outcomes of experiment. Of course, an observer should be qualiﬁed, i.e., knowing
the quantum theory. The authors of article [170] say mean: “but there is no sense
in which the quantum state itself represents (, like pictures, copies, corresponds to,
correlates with a part or a whole of the external world, much less a world that just
is.” For this position. QBism is often criticized that the personal agent perspective
leads to solipsism. This accusation in solipsism is analyzed and rejected by QBists
(see article [169]).
Generally QBism is strongly opposed to representationism, “attempts to directly
represent—(map, picture, copy, correspond to, correlate with)—he universe—with
“universe” here thought of in totality as a pre-existing, static system; an unchanging,
monistic something that just is.” [170]. Philosophically, QBIsm is coupled to nonre-
ductionism, empiricism, and meliorism. The latter coupling is especially important
for this chapter and we consider it in more detail in Sect.21.4.
Following de Finetti [120, 121] QBists pointed out that consistent appealing
to the subjective interpretation of probability should lead to reconsideration of the
objective treatment of the scientiﬁc methodology. In fact, de Finetti was even more
revolutionary than QBists, because his subjective treatment of scientiﬁc method was
not restricted to physics.
21.3
QBism Versus Copenhagen Interpretation
Although Bohr’s views and the Copenhagen interpretation stimulated development
of QBism. QBists prefer not to be identiﬁed as just a special stream within the
Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics. As Fuchs wrote [169], “Without
Niels Bohr, QBism would be nothing. But QBism is not Bohr. This paper attempts

336
21
God as Decision Maker and Quantum Bayesianism
to show that, despite a popular misconception, QBism is no minor tweak to Bohr’s
interpretation of quantum mechanics. It is something quite distinct.”
D. Mermin claimed that QBism differs crucially from all interpretations in the
spirit of Copenhagen, see [352], pp. 7–8:
A fundamental difference between QBism and any ﬂavor of Copenhagen, is that QBism
explicitly introduces each user of quantum mechanics into the story, together with the world
external to that user. Since every user is different, dividing the world differently into external
and internal, every application of quantum mechanics to the world must ultimately refer, if
only implicitly, to a particular user. But every version of Copenhagen takes a view of the
world that makes no reference to the particular user who is trying to make sense of that
world. Fuchs and Schack prefer the term “agent” to “user”. “Agent” serves to emphasize that
the user takes actions on her world and experiences the consequences of her actions. I prefer
the term “user” to emphasize Fuchs’ and Schack’s equally important point that science is a
user’s manual. Its purpose is to help each of us make sense of our private experience induced
in us by the world outside of us. It is crucial to note from the beginning that “user” does
not mean a generic body of users. It means a particular individual person, who is making
use of science to bring coherence to her own private perceptions. I can be a “user”. You
can be a “user”. But we are not jointly a user, because my internal personal experience is
inaccessible to you except insofar as I attempt to represent it to you verbally, and vice-versa.
Science is about the interface between the experience of any particular person and the subset
of the world that is external to that particular user. This is unlike anything in any version of
Copenhagen. It is central to the QBist understanding of science.
21.4
Free Will Given by God to Adam is the Source of
Irreducible Uncertainty in the Universe
For QBists [170], “the world before the agent is malleable to some extent—that his
actions really can change it.” Fuchs illustrates this position by the following allusion
to Bible.
Adam said to God, “I want the ability to write messages onto the world.” God replied,
“You ask much of me. If you want to write upon the world, it cannot be so rigid a thing
as I had originally intended. The world would have to have some malleability, with enough
looseness for you to write upon its properties. It will make your world more unpredictable
than it would have been – I may not be able to warn you about impending dangers like
droughts and hurricanes as effectively as I could have – but I can make it such if you want.
So, Adam got the possibility to inﬂuence actively to the world, but the price was very
high uncertainty.
Since this chapter is based on paper [297], a part of the special volume devoted
to the scientiﬁc enlightenment of the religious questions, it is interesting to discuss
the probabilistic meaning of God’s reply to Adam. This reply clearly shows that
free will of Adam restricts God’s ability to control events happening in the world.
Thus human’s free will is the source of the irreducible uncertainty in the universe.
It is natural to couple this free will generated uncertainty with irreducible quantum
uncertainty and acausality which were ﬁrst considered by von Neumann [451].

21.5 God as Decision Maker Operating with Subjective Probability Assigned …
337
This picture contradicts to the interpretation of God’s power as absolute, as the
ability to control deterministically the stream of all events in the universe. So, if God
did not give up and he is still trying to preserve order, his control machinery has
to be probabilistic. In our model, God’s control is statistical, not individual. From
this viewpoint, the religious would-picture is not deterministic at all. Statements
that everything in human’s life is under divine providence do not match the above
picture of the uncertain universe. In particular, catastrophic events in human’s life,
say wars, are not punishments for sins. They are generated by humans’ free wills. In
the uncertain universe paradigm, each person has big responsibility for his mental
and physical actions.
21.5
God as Decision Maker Operating with Subjective
Probability Assigned to His Personal Experiences
As we see from the previous chapters of the book, quantum-like modeling was very
successful in decision-making. The subjective interpretation of probability is very
commoninclassicaldecision-making,e.g.,asthebasisofthesubjectiveutilitytheory.
In this book we focus to just brieﬂy discussed the QP interpretation (Chap.2) and,
in particular, mentioned QBism and the subjective interpretation. This is the good
place to mention now that probabilities considered in Chaps.9, 10 can be interpreted
as subjective ones and the answers to the questions as the personal experiences of
humans. Thus, the mathematical formalism developed in these two chapters matches
with QBism very well.
Now consider God as decision maker who processes and updates the state of
psycho-physical universe to preserve the order in the world, but only statistically. God
also has his belief state and assigns subjective probability for possible outcomes—his
possible personal experiences. God’s behavior can be described by the mathematical
formalism presented in this book charged with the QBism interpretation. This inter-
esting theme is beyond book’s topic, may be I shall continue quantum-like theological
modeling in future works.
Finally, we point out to the most intriguing issue of the quantum-like model of
God’s order-control in the universe. Quantum theory is characterized by the presence
ofincompatibleobservables.Inparticular,theydescribeincompatiblefreewills.Such
free wills cannot be embedded in a consistent mental picture. The following natural
question arises:
How can God manage such mutually complementary wills?

A.1
Proof of Theorem 4.7.1, Chap.4
As was promised in Chap.4, here we give the proof of Theorem 1.
Proof We recall that in this paper we proceed with ﬁnite dimensional state spaces.
Consider the space of dimension d. By the monotonicity of quantum Kullba-
ceibler information (relative entropy), S(T ρ|T ρ′) ≤S(ρ|ρ′), where S(ρ|ρ′) =
Tr[ρlogρ] −Tr[ρ log ρ′]. Then,
S(ρ|I/d) = Tr[ρ log ρ] −Tr[ρ(−log d)]
= log d −(−Tr[ρ log ρ]) = log d −S(ρ).
If T is unital, i.e., T I = I, we have
S(T ρ) −S(ρ) = [log d −S(T ρ||I/d)] −[log d −S(ρ||I/d)]
= S(ρ|I/d) −S(T ρ|T (I/d)) ≥0.
Thus, we conclude that
S(T ρ) ≥S(ρ),

if T is unital. Conversely, if
S(T ρ) ≥S(ρ)
for all states ρ, we have S(T (I/d)) ≥S(I/d) = log d so that T (I/d) = I/d. Thus,
we have proven that S(T ρ) ≥S(ρ) for all states ρ if and only if T is unital.
A.2
Construction of Quantum Channels
Here we construct quantum channels which were discussed in Chap.5. The con-
structions of the desired quantum channel for subsystem’s state spaces of dimen-
sions N = 2 and N > 2 are different. In the latter case, the expressions for the von
Neumann entropies of the subsystems Si, i = 1, 2, contain the factor log(N −2).
Therefore, we consider these cases separately.

We remark that this is the density operator corresponding to a pure state and the
von Neumann entropy of ρ0 equals zero:
S (ρ0) = 0.
We point out that the pure state under consideration is separable (non-entangled)
and hence the two marginal states of ρ0 are given by density operators corresponding

We emphasize that this is the density operator corresponding to an entangled

The entropy of transformed state  (ρ0) coincides with the entropy of the initial

The von Neumann entropy of two marginal states 1ρ01 and 2ρ02 are
S (iρ0i) = log 2 > S (ρ0i) = S ( (ρ0)) = 0.
Thus the entropies of both subsystems increased for log 2-amount, but the entropy
of S preserves its zero value.

A.3
Signaling from Contextual State Modiﬁcation
In this section we present the framework of Sect.17.11 (Chap.17) in more detail and
without direct connection to cognition.
Consider the tensor product framework: state space H = Ha ⊗Hb and operators
A j = A j ⊗I, B j = I ⊗B j, j = 1, 2, where Hermitian operators A j and B j act in
Ha and Hb, respectively, and have the eignenvectors |±ai⟩⟩, |±b j ⟩. Denote their
tensor products by
| +i + j⟩, | +i −j⟩, | −i + j⟩, | −i −j⟩;
(A.1)
they form the basis in H. Here labeling by indexes of observables ai and b j is
important. We shall consider states which are entangled w.r.t. to the concrete pairs
of observables and not, as typically one does, rotationally invariant entangled states.
For each pair of observables ai, b j, consider two (orthogonal) subspaces generated
by the vectors in the brackets:
Li j±∓= {| +i −j⟩, | −i + j⟩}, Li j±± = {| +i + j⟩, | −i −j⟩}
(A.2)
and projections Ei j±∓, Ei j±± onto these subspaces.
We are interested in the quantum description of measurements of the pairs of
observables (a1, b1), (a1, b2), (a2, b1), (a2, b2). They are represented by pairs of
(Hermitian) operators (A1, B1), (A1, B2), (A2, B1), (A2, B2) acting in H. However,
we modify the standard scheme for such measurements and suppose that measure-
ment of each pair of observables (ai, b j) is preceded by the projection of the initial
state |ψ⟩either onto Li j±± or onto Li j±∓. Thus, by the Lüders postulate the initial
state is transformed as
|ψ⟩→|ψi j±±⟩=
Ei j±±|ψ⟩
||Ei j±±|ψ⟩||,
(A.3)
|ψ⟩→|ψi j±∓⟩=
Ei j±∓|ψ⟩
||Ei j±∓|ψ⟩||.
(A.4)
By using canonical bases in these subspaces we write
|ψ⟩i j±± = ⟨ψ| +i + j⟩| +i + j⟩+ ⟨ψ| −i −j⟩| +i + j⟩

|⟨ψ| +i + j⟩|2 + |⟨ψ| −i −j⟩|2

Any projection represents additional part of the state preparation before the
(ai, b j)-measurement. This state preparation is by itself based on the measurement
(see later consideration).
Now consider such a measurement scheme in which, for three pairs of indexes,
projections are selected of the same type and the forth projection is of the different
type. For example, for the pairs of observables (a1, b1), (a1, b2), (a2, b1), projections
are of the (±, ∓) type and, for the pair (a2, b2), projection is of the (±, ±) type.
Calculatecorrelationsforthisexperimentalscheme;for(a1, b1), (a1, b2), (a2, b1),
we have:
⟨aib j⟩= ⟨ψi j±∓|Ai B j|ψi j±∓⟩=
(A.7)
⟨⟨ψ| +i −j⟩| +i −j⟩+ ⟨ψ| −i + j⟩| −i + j⟩|Ai ⊗B j|⟨ψ| +i −j⟩| +i −j⟩+ ⟨ψ| −i + j⟩| −i + j⟩⟩
|⟨ψ| +i −j⟩|2 + |⟨ψ| −i + j⟩|2
= −1
and
⟨a2b2⟩= +1
(A.8)
Therefore,
|⟨a1b1⟩+ ⟨a1b2⟩+ ⟨a2b1⟩−⟨a2b2⟩| = −4
(A.9)
Thus, within the proposed quantum measurement scheme the CHSH correlation can
exceed the Tsirelson bound and approach the maximal possible contextual value.
Now we shall turn to the problem of signaling. The probabilities generated by the
above experimental scheme can be theoretically represented as quantum conditional
probabilities. Let us introduce observables di j represented by the operators
Di j = Ei j±± −Ei j±∓.
(A.10)
For example, for (a1, b1), (a1, b2), (a2, b1), the probabilities under consideration can
be written as
q(ai = α, b j = β) ≡p(ai = α, b j = β|di j = −; ψ),
(A.11)
and
q(a2 = α, b2 = β) ≡p(a2 = α, b2 = β|d22 = +; ψ)
(A.12)
Then, e.g., in the ﬁrst case we have:
q(ai = +, b j = −) = ⟨ψi j±∓|Eai (+)Eb j (−)|ψi j±∓⟩=
|⟨ψ| +i −j⟩|2
|⟨ψ| +i −j⟩|2 + |⟨ψ| −i + j⟩|2 ,
(A.13)
q(ai = −, b j = +) =
|⟨ψ| −i + j⟩|2
|⟨ψ| +i −j⟩|2 + |⟨ψ| −i + j⟩|2 ,
(A.14)

Appendix A: Technicalities
347
and
q(ai = +, b j = +) = q(ai = −, b j = −) = 0.
(A.15)
Hence, e.g.,
q j(ai = +) ≡

β
q(ai = +, b j = β) = q(ai = +, b j = −) =
|⟨ψ| +i −j⟩|2
|⟨ψ| +i −j⟩|2 + |⟨ψ| −i + j⟩|2
(A.16)
Generally
|⟨ψ| +i −j⟩|2
|⟨ψ| +i −j⟩|2 + |⟨ψ| −i + j⟩|2 ̸=
|⟨ψ| + −⟩ik|2
|⟨ψ| + −⟩ik|2 + |⟨ψ| −+⟩ik|2 , k ̸= j.
(A.17)
Thus, signaling is the natural property of the presented measurement scheme within
the quantum formalism. The source of signaling is the pre-measurement state prepa-
ration given by (A.3), (A.4). Now, for Ei j±∓projections, we have:
⟨ai⟩j = q j(ai = +) −q j(ai = −) = ⟨ψi j±∓|Eai(+) −Eai(−)|ψi j±∓⟩
(A.18)
= ⟨ψ|Ei j±∓Ai Ei j±∓|ψ⟩= |⟨ψ| +i −j⟩|2 −|⟨ψ| −i + j⟩|2
|⟨ψ| +i −j⟩|2 + |⟨ψ| −i + j⟩|2
Finally, for example,
⟨a1⟩1 −⟨a1⟩2 = ⟨ψ|E11±∓A1E11±∓|ψ⟩−⟨ψ|E12±∓A1E12±∓|ψ⟩.
(A.19)
or
⟨a1⟩1 −⟨a1⟩2 = |⟨ψ| +1 −1⟩|2 −|⟨ψ| −1 +1⟩|2
|⟨ψ| +1 −1⟩|2 + |⟨ψ| −1 +1⟩|2 −|⟨ψ| +1 −2⟩|2 −|⟨ψ| −1 +2⟩|2
|⟨ψ| +1 −2⟩|2 + |⟨ψ| −1 +2⟩|2 .
We can express the quantity 	0, (see (17.33), the measure of signaling) in the quan-
tum terms:

Appendix A: Technicalities
In the presented context the CHSH-DK inequality has the form:
4 −	0 > 2 or 	0 < 2.
(A.21)
So, this is the upper bound for signaling; if signaling is too high it would shadow
correlations. In the experiments of article [53] inequality (A.21) was satisﬁed. Hence,
signaling (the direct inﬂuences in the terminology of Dzhafarov–Kujala) is rather low
and one can ﬁnd “true contextuality”.
Wealsoremarkthatprojectionscommutewiththespectralprojectionsofoperators
Ai, B j. We show this
Ei j±∓Eai(α)|ψ⟩= Ei j±∓(⟨ψ|α+ j⟩|α+ j⟩+ ⟨ψ|α−j⟩|α−j⟩) = ⟨ψ|α−j⟩| +i −j⟩
and
Eai (α)Ei j±∓|ψ⟩= Eai (α)(⟨ψ| +i −j⟩| +i −j⟩+ ⟨ψ| −i + j⟩| −i + j⟩) = ⟨ψ|αi−j⟩i j|αi−j⟩.
Hence, [Ei j±∓, Eai (α)] = 0, α = ±, and in the same way [Ei j±∓, Eb j (β)] = 0, β =
± as well as [Ei j±±, Eai (α)] = 0, [Ei j±∓, Eb j (β)] = 0. Observables (ai, b j, di j)
(see (A.10)) are compatible and, hence, each triple can be jointly measurable and we
can ﬁnd their JPDs:
p(ai = +, b j = −, di j = −|ψ) = ||Eb j(−)Eai(+)Ei j|ψ⟩||2 = |⟨ψ| +i −j⟩|2;
p(ai = −, b j = +, di j = −|ψ) = ||Eb j(+)Eai(−)Ei j|ψ⟩||2 = |⟨ψ| −i + j⟩|2;
p(ai = +, b j = +, di j = −|ψ) = p(ai = −, b j = −, di j = −|ψ) = 0;
p(ai = +, b j = +, di j = +|ψ) = ||Eb j(+)Eai(+)ei j±±|ψ⟩||2 = |⟨ψ| +i + j⟩|2;
p(ai = −, b j = −, di j = +|ψ) = ||Eb j(−)Eai(−)Ei j|ψ⟩||2 = |⟨ψ| −i −j⟩|2;
p(ai = +, b j = −, di j = +|ψ) = p(ai = −, b j = +, ei j = −|ψ) = 0.
We remark that conditional quantum probabilities can be represented as classical
conditional probabilities, given by Bayes’ formula:
q(ai = +, b j = −) ≡p(ai = +, b j = −|di j = −; ψ) = p(ai = +, b j = −, di j = −|ψ)/p(di j = −|ψ).
