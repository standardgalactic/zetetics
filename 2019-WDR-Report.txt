Foreword
At a time when the global economy is growing and the poverty rate is the 
lowest in recorded history, it would be easy to become complacent and over-
look looming challenges. One of the most critical is the future of work, the 
subject of the 2019 World Development Report. 
“Machines are coming to take our jobs” has been a concern for hundreds 
of years—at least since the industrialization of weaving in the early 18th 
century, which raised productivity and also fears that thousands of workers 
would be thrown out on the streets. Innovation and technological progress 
have caused disruption, but they have created more prosperity than they 
have destroyed. Yet today, we are riding a new wave of uncertainty as the 
pace of innovation continues to accelerate and technology affects every part 
of our lives. 
We know that robots are taking over thousands of routine tasks and 
will eliminate many low-skill jobs in advanced economies and developing 
countries. At the same time, technology is creating opportunities, paving 
the way for new and altered jobs, increasing productivity, and improving 
the delivery of public services. When we consider the scope of the challenge 
to prepare for the future of work, it is important to understand that many 
children currently in primary school will work in jobs as adults that do not 
even exist today. 
That is why this Report emphasizes the primacy of human capital in meet-
ing a challenge that, by its very definition, resists simple and prescriptive 
solutions. Many jobs today, and many more in the near future, will require 
specific skills—a combination of technological know-how, problem-solving, 
and critical thinkingas well as soft skills such as perseverance, collabora-
tion, and empathy. The days of staying in one job, or with one company, for 
decades are waning. In the gig economy, workers will likely have many gigs 
over the course of their careers, which means they will have to be lifelong 
learners. 
Innovation will continue to accelerate, but developing countries will 
need to take rapid action to ensure they can compete in the economy of 
the future. They will have to invest in their people with a fierce sense of 
urgencyespecially in health and education, which are the building blocks 
of human capitalto harness the benefits of technology and to blunt its 
worst disruptions. But right now too many countries are not making these 
critical investments. 
Our Human Capital Project aims to fix that. This study unveils our new 
Human Capital Index, which measures the consequences of neglecting 
investments in human capital in terms of the lost productivity of the next 
generation of workers. In countries with the lowest human capital invest-
ments today, our analysis suggests that the workforce of the future will only 
be one-third to one-half as productive as it could be if people enjoyed full 
health and received a high-quality education.

Adjusting to the changing nature of work also requires rethinking the 
social contract. We need new ways to invest in people and to protect them, 
regardless of their employment status. Yet four out of five people in develop-
ing countries have never known what it means to live with social protection. 
With 2 billion people already working in the informal sectorunprotected 
by stable wage employment, social safety nets, or the benefits of education 
new working patterns are adding to a dilemma that predates the latest 
innovations.  
This Report challenges governments to take better care of their citizens 
and calls for a universal, guaranteed minimum level of social protection. 
It can be done with the right reforms, such as ending unhelpful subsidies; 
improving labor market regulations; and, globally, overhauling taxation pol-
icies. Investing in human capital is not just a concern for ministers of health 
and education; it should also be a top priority for heads of state and min­
isters of finance. The Human Capital Project will put the evidence squarely 
in front of those decision makers, and the index will make it hard to ignore.  
The 2019 World Development Report is unique in its transparency. For the 
first time since the World Bank began publishing the WDR in 1978, we 
made an updated draft publicly available, online each week, throughout the 
writing process. For over seven months, it has benefited from thousands of 
comments and ideas from development practitioners, government officials, 
scholars, and readers from all over the world. I hope many of you will have 
already read the Report. Over 400,000 downloads later (and counting), I am 
pleased to present it to you in its final form.

Overview

T
here has never been a time when mankind was not afraid of where 
its talent for innovation might lead. In the 19th century, Karl Marx 
worried that “machinery does not just act as a superior competitor 
to the worker, always on the point of making him superfluous. It is 
the most powerful weapon for suppressing strikes.”1 John Maynard Keynes 
warned in 1930 of widespread unemployment arising from technology.2 
And yet innovation has transformed living standards. Life expectancy has 
gone up; basic health care and education are widespread; and most people 
have seen their incomes rise. 
Three-quarters of the citizens of the European Union, the world’s lifestyle 
superpower, believe that the workplace benefits from technology, according 
to a recent Eurobarometer survey. Two-thirds said technology will benefit 
society and improve their quality of life even further (figure O.1).
Despite this optimism, concerns about the future remain. People living in 
advanced economies are anxious about the sweeping impact of technology 
on employment. They hold a view that rising inequality, compounded by 
the advent of the gig economy (in which organizations contract with inde-
pendent workers for short-term engagements), is encouraging a race to the 
bottom in working conditions. 
This troubling scenario, however, is on balance unfounded. It is true that 
in some advanced economies and middle-income countries manufacturing 
jobs are being lost to automation. Workers undertaking routine tasks that 
are “codifiable” are the most vulnerable to replacement. And yet technology 
provides opportunities to create new jobs, increase productivity, and deliver 
effective public services. Through innovation, technology generates new 
sectors and new tasks.

Overview    |    3
Some features of the current wave of technological progress are notable. 
Digital technologies allow firms to scale up or down quickly, blurring the 
boundaries of firms and challenging traditional production patterns. New 
business models—digital platform firms—are evolving from local start-ups 
to global behemoths, often with few employees or tangible assets (figure 
O.2). This new industrial organization poses policy questions in the areas 
of privacy, competition, and taxation. The ability of governments to raise 
revenues is curtailed by the virtual nature of productive assets.
The rise of platform marketplaces allows the effects of technology to 
reach more people more quickly than ever before. Individuals and firms 
need only a broadband connection to trade goods and services on online 
platforms. This “scale without mass” brings economic opportunity to mil-
lions of people who do not live in industrialized countries or even industrial 
areas.3 The changing demand for skills reaches the same people. Automation 
raises the premium on high-order cognitive skills in advanced and emerging 
economies.
Investing in human capital is the priority to make the most of this evolv-
ing economic opportunity. Three types of skills are increasingly important in 
labor markets: advanced cognitive skills such as complex problem-solving, 
sociobehavioral skills such as teamwork, and skill combinations that are 
predictive of adaptability such as reasoning and self-efficacy. Building these 
skills requires strong human capital foundations and lifelong learning. 
The foundations of human capital, created in early childhood, have thus 
become more important. Yet governments in developing countries do not 
give priority to early childhood development, and the human capital out-
comes of basic schooling are suboptimal. The World Bank’s new human 
capital index, presented in this study for the first time, highlights the link

between investments in health and education and the productivity of future 
workers. For example, climbing from the 25th to the 75th percentile on the 
index brings an additional 1.4 percent annual growth over 50 years.
Creating formal jobs is the first-best policy, consistent with the Interna-
tional Labour Organization’s decent work agenda, to seize the benefits of 
technological change. In many developing countries, most workers remain 
in low-productivity employment, often in the informal sector with little 
access to technology. Lack of quality private sector jobs leaves talented 
young people with few pathways to wage employment. High-skill univer-
sity graduates currently make up almost 30 percent of the unemployed pool 
of labor in the Middle East and North Africa. Better adult learning oppor-
tunities enable those who have left school to reskill according to changing 
labor market demands.
Investments in infrastructure are also needed. Most obvious are invest-
ments in affordable access to the Internet for people in developing countries 
who remain unconnected. Equally important are more investments in the 
road, port, and municipal infrastructure on which firms, governments, and 
individuals rely to exploit technologies to their full potential. 
Adjusting to the next wave of jobs requires social protection. Eight in 10 
people in developing countries receive no social assistance, and 6 in 10 work 
informally without insurance.
Even in advanced economies, the payroll-based insurance model is 
increasingly challenged by working arrangements outside standard employ-
ment contracts. What are some new ways of protecting people? A societal 
minimum that provides support independent of employment is one option. 
This model, which would include mandated and voluntary social insurance, 
could reach many more people.
Social protection can be strengthened by expanding overall coverage that 
prioritizes the neediest people in society. Placing community health work-
ers on the government’s payroll is a step in the right direction. A universal 
basic income is another possibility, but it is untested and fiscally prohibitive 
for emerging economies. Enhanced social assistance and insurance systems 
would reduce the burden of risk management on labor regulation. As people 
become better protected through such systems, labor regulation could, where 
appropriate, be made more balanced to facilitate movement between jobs.
For societies to benefit from the potential that technology offers, they 
would need a new social contract centered on larger investments in human 
capital and progressively provided universal social protection (figure O.3). 
However, social inclusion requires fiscal space, and many developing coun-
tries lack the finances because of inadequate tax bases, large informal sec-
tors, and inefficient administration.
And yet there is plenty of room for improvement through, for example, 
better collection of property taxes in urban municipalities or the introduc-
tion of excise taxes on sugar or tobacco. The latter would have direct health 
benefits as well. Levying indirect taxes, reforming subsidies, and reducing

tax avoidance by global corporations, especially among the new platform 
companies, are other possible sources of financing. In fact, the traditional 
structure of the global tax order provides opportunities for multinational 
corporations to engage in base erosion and profit shifting—that is, some 
firms allocate more profits to affiliates located in zero- or low-tax countries 
no matter how little business is conducted there. By some estimates, on 
average, 50 percent of the total foreign income of multinationals is reported 
in jurisdictions with an effective tax rate of less than 5 percent.4 
Emerging economies are in the middle of a technological shift that is 
bringing change to the nature of work. Whatever the future holds, invest-
ment in human capital is a no-regrets policy that prepares people for the 
challenges ahead.
Changes in the nature of work
Several stylized facts have dominated the discussion on the changing nature 
of work. However, only some of them are accurate in the context of emerg-
ing economies. 
First, technology is blurring the boundaries of the firm, as evident in the 
rise of platform marketplaces. Using digital technologies, entrepreneurs are 
creating global platform–based businesses that differ from the traditional 
production process in which inputs are provided at one end and output 
delivered at the other. Platform companies often generate value by creating

a network effect that connects customers, producers, and providers, while 
facilitating interactions in a multisided model. 
Compared with traditional companies, digital platforms scale up faster 
and at lower cost. IKEA, the Swedish company founded in 1943, waited 
almost 30 years before it began expanding within Europe. After more than 
seven decades, it achieved global annual sales revenue of US$42 billion. 
Using digital technology, the Chinese conglomerate Alibaba was able to 
reach 1 million users in two years and accumulate more than 9 million 
online merchants and annual sales of $700 billion in 15 years. Meanwhile, 
platform-based businesses are on the rise in every country—such as Flipkart 
in India and Jumia in Nigeria. Globally, however, integrated virtual market-
places are posing new policy challenges in the fields of privacy, competition, 
and taxation.
Second, technology is reshaping the skills needed for work. The demand 
for less advanced skills that can be replaced by technology is declining. At 
the same time, the demand for advanced cognitive skills, sociobehavioral 
skills, and skill combinations associated with greater adaptability is rising. 
Already evident in developed countries, this pattern is starting to emerge in 
some developing countries as well. In Bolivia, the share of employment in 
high-skill occupations increased by 8 percentage points from 2000 to 2014. 
In Ethiopia, this increase was 13 percentage points. These changes show up 
not just through new jobs replacing old jobs, but also through the changing 
skills profiles of existing jobs.
Third, the idea of robots replacing workers is striking a nerve. However, 
the threat to jobs from technology is exaggerated—and history has repeat-
edly taught this lesson. The data on global industrial jobs simply do not bear 
out these concerns. Advanced economies have shed industrial jobs, but the 
rise of the industrial sector in East Asia has more than compensated for this 
loss (figure O.4). 
The decline in industrial employment in many high-income economies 
over the last two decades is a well-studied trend. Portugal, Singapore, and 
Spain are among the countries in which the share of industrial employment 
has dropped 10 percent or more since 1991. This change reflects a shift 
in employment from manufacturing to services. By contrast, the share of 
industrial employment, primarily manufacturing, has remained stable in 
the rest of the world. In low-income countries, the proportion of the total 
labor force working in industry from 1991 to 2017 was consistently around 
10 percent. The situation was stable in upper-middle-income countries as 
well, at around 23 percent. Lower-middle-income countries experienced an 
increase in the proportion of the labor force in the industrial sector over the 
same period, from 16 percent in 1991 to 19 percent in 2017. This increase 
may stem from the interplay of open trade and rising incomes, which gen-
erates more demand for goods, services, and technology. 
In some developing countries, the share of industrial employment over-
all is going up. For example, in Vietnam it rose from 9 percent in 1991 to 
25 percent in 2017. In the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, the share of 

Overview    |    7
industrial employment rose from 3 percent to 10 percent over the same 
period. These countries have upgraded their human capital, bringing highly 
skilled young workers into the labor market, who, together with new tech-
nology, upgrade manufacturing production. As a result, industrial employ-
ment in East Asia continues to rise, whereas in other developing economies 
it is stable.
Two forces are increasing the demand for industrial products and there-
fore the demand for labor in the industrial sector. On the one hand, the 
falling costs of connectivity are leading to more capital-intensive exports 
from advanced economies and more labor-intensive exports from emerg-
ing economies. On the other, rising incomes are increasing consumption of 
existing products and the demand for new ones. 
Fourth, in many developing countries a large number of workers remain 
in low-productivity jobs, often in informal sector firms whose access to 
technology is poor. Informality has remained high over the last two decades 
despite improvements in the business regulatory environment (figure O.5). 
Indeed, the share of informal workers is as high as 90 percent in some 
emerging economies. Overall, about two-thirds of the labor force in 
these economies is informal. Informality has remained remarkably stable 
notwithstanding economic growth or the changing nature of work. For 
example, in Peru, despite all the attention focused on the issue, informal-
ity has remained constant at about 75 percent over the last 30 years. In  
Sub-Saharan Africa, informality remained, on average, at around 75 percent

Addressing informality and the absence of social protection for workers 
continues to be the most pressing concern for emerging economies.

Fifth, technology, in particular social media, affects the perception of rising 
inequality in many countries. People have always aspired toward a higher 
quality of life and participation in the economic growth they see around 
them. Increased exposure through social media and other digital com-
munications to different, often divergent lifestyles and opportunities only 
heightens this feeling. Where aspirations are linked to opportunities, the 
conditions are ripe for inclusive, sustainable economic growth. But if there 
is inequality of opportunity or a mismatch between available jobs and skills, 
frustration can lead to migration or societal fragmentation. The refugee  
crises in Europe, the war-pushed migrants from the Syrian Arab Republic, 
and the Arab Spring are notable manifestations of this perception.
This perception is not corroborated, however, by the data on income 
inequality in developing countries. Inequality in most emerging economies 
has declined or remained unchanged over the last decade. From 2007 to 
2015, 37 of 41 of these economies experienced a decline or no change in 
inequality, as measured by the Gini coefficient. The four emerging econo-
mies in which inequality rose were Armenia, Bulgaria, Cameroon, and Tur-
key. In the Russian Federation, between 2007 and 2015 the Gini measure of 
inequality fell from 42 to 38. Between 2008 and 2015, the share of income 
of the top 10 percent of the population (based on pretax income) fell from 
52 to 46 percent. The share of employment in small firms rose over that 
period, which improved wages relative to those of large firms.
Yet there is little to celebrate in the fact that income inequality is not, 
despite perceptions, rising—and even less when considering that globally 
2 billion people are working in the informal economy, where so many lack 
any protection. Social insurance is virtually nonexistent in low-income 
countries, and even in upper-middle-income countries it reaches only  
28 percent of the poorest people. 
What can governments do?
The analysis suggests areas in which governments could act:
•  Investing in human capital, particularly early childhood education, to 
develop high-order cognitive and sociobehavioral skills in addition to 
foundational skills. 
•  Enhancing social protection. A solid guaranteed social minimum and 
strengthened social insurance, complemented by reforms in labor market 
rules in some emerging economies, would achieve this goal. 
•  Creating fiscal space for public financing of human capital development 
and social protection. Property taxes in large cities, excise taxes on sugar 
or tobacco, and carbon taxes are among the ways to increase a govern-
ment’s revenue. Another is to eliminate the tax avoidance techniques that 
many firms use to increase their profits. Governments can optimize their 
taxation policy and improve tax administration to increase revenue with-
out resorting to tax rate increases.

10    |    WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2019
The most significant investments that people, firms, and governments can 
make in the changing nature of work are in enhancing human capital. A 
basic level of human capital, such as literacy and numeracy, is needed for 
economic survival. The growing role of technology in life and business means 
that all types of jobs (including low-skill ones) require more advanced cog-
nitive skills. The role of human capital is also enhanced because of the rising 
demand for sociobehavioral skills. Jobs that rely on interpersonal interaction 
will not be readily replaced by machines. However, to succeed at these jobs, 
sociobehavioral skills—acquired in one’s early years and shaped throughout 
one’s lifetime—must be strong. Human capital is important because there is 
now a higher premium on adaptability.
Solutions are available. For example, to prepare for the changing nature 
of work countries must boost their investment in early childhood devel-
opment. This is one of the most effective ways to build valuable skills for 
future labor markets. Countries can also boost human capital by ensuring 
that schooling results in learning. Important adjustments in skills to meet 
the demands of the changing nature of work are also likely outside compul-
sory schooling and formal jobs. Countries can, for example, utilize tertiary 
education and adult learning more effectively.
One reason governments do not invest in human capital is the lack of 
political incentives. Few data are publicly available on whether health and 
education systems are generating human capital. This gap hinders the design 
of effective solutions, the pursuit of improvement, and the ability of citizens 
to hold their governments accountable. The World Bank’s human capital 
project, described in this study, is designed to address the shortcomings of 
political incentives and provide the impetus for investing in human capital.
Social assistance and insurance systems should also be adapted to the 
changing nature of work. The concept of progressive universalism could be 
a guiding principle in covering more people, especially in the informal econ-
omy. When social protection is established, flexible labor regulation eases 
work transitions.
The current social contract is broken in most emerging economies, and it 
is looking increasingly out of date in some advanced economies as well. A 
new social contract should include investing in human capital to generate 
more opportunities for workers to find better jobs. This will improve the job 
prospects for newborns or schoolchildren.
How will governments raise the additional resources needed to invest in 
human capital and advance social inclusion? The share of tax revenue in low- 
income countries is half that of high-income countries (figure O.6). Invest-
ments in human capital, basic social protection (including community health 
workers in some developing countries), and productive opportunities for 
youth are likely to have fiscal costs of 6–8 percent of gross domestic product 
(GDP). This is an ambitious goal. Increasing tax revenue, however, should go 
hand in hand with improving public service delivery. If not, increasing tax 
rates will only spur further public discontent.
Most of the required fiscal resources are likely to come from improved 
capacity in tax administration and policy changes, particularly to value 

Overview    |    11
added taxes and through expan-
sion of the tax base. Sub-Saharan 
African countries could raise, 
on average, from 3 to 5 percent 
of GDP in additional revenues 
through reforms that improve 
the efficiency of the current tax 
systems.5 Closing tax exemp-
tions and converging toward a 
uniform tax rate in value added 
tax could raise further revenues. 
In Costa Rica and Uruguay, such 
revenues could amount to more 
than 3 percent of GDP. 
Other taxes and savings could 
also contribute to the financing 
of human capital. Saudi Arabia 
adopted excise taxes in 2017: 
50 percent on soft drinks and 
100 percent on energy drinks, 
tobacco, and tobacco products. 
It is estimated that nationally efficient carbon pricing policies would raise 
more than 6 percent of GDP in China, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Rus-
sia, and Saudi Arabia.6 Taxes on immovable property could raise an addi-
tional 3 percent of GDP in middle-income countries and 1 percent in poor 
countries.7 
Age-old tax avoidance and evasion schemes by firms and individuals need 
to be tackled as well. Four out of five Fortune 500 companies operate one 
or more subsidiaries in countries broadly perceived to operate preferential 
corporate tax regimes—often referred to as “tax havens.” As a result, esti-
mates suggest that governments worldwide may miss out on US$100–$240 
billion in annual revenue, which is equivalent to 4–10 percent of the global 
corporate income tax revenue. The increasingly digital nature of business 
only creates more opportunities for tax avoidance. Generating revenue from 
new kinds of assets, such as user data, makes it increasingly unclear how or 
where value is created for tax purposes.
Organization of this study
The first chapter of this study looks at the impact of technology on jobs. 
In some sectors, robots are replacing workers. In other sectors, robots 
are enhancing worker productivity. And in further sectors, technol-
ogy is creating jobs as it shapes the demand for new goods and services. 
These disparate effects of technology render the economic predictions of  
technology-induced job losses basically useless. Predictions sensationalize 
the impact of technology and stir fears, especially among middle-skill work-
ers in routine jobs.

Technology does, however, change the demand for skills. Since 2001, 
the share of employment in occupations heavy in nonroutine cognitive 
and sociobehavioral skills has increased from 19 to 23 percent in emerging 
economies and from 33 to 41 percent in advanced economies. The payoffs 
to these skills, as well as to combinations of different skill types, are also 
increasing in those economies. But the pace of innovation will determine 
whether new sectors or tasks emerge to counterbalance the decline of old 
sectors and routine jobs as technology costs decline. Meanwhile, whether 
the cost of labor remains low in emerging economies in relation to capital 
will determine whether firms choose to automate production or move else-
where. Chapter 1 sets out a model for the changing nature of work.
One feature of the current wave of technological progress is that it has 
made the boundaries of firms more permeable and has accelerated the 
emergence of superstar firms. Such firms have a beneficial effect on the 
demand for labor by boosting production and employment. These firms are 
also large integrators of young, innovative firms, often benefiting small busi-
nesses by connecting them with larger markets. But large firms, particularly 
firms in the digital economy, also pose risks. Regulations often fail to address 
the challenges created by new types of businesses in the digital economy. 
Antitrust frameworks also have to adjust to the impact of network effects on 
competition. Tax systems in many ways no longer fit their purposes as well. 
Chapter 2 examines how technological change affects the nature of the firm.
At the economywide level, human capital is positively correlated with 
the overall level of adoption of advanced technologies. Firms with a higher 
share of educated workers do better at innovating. Individuals with stron-
ger human capital reap higher economic returns from new technologies. By 
contrast, when technological disruptions are met with inadequate human 
capital, the existing social order may be undermined. Chapter 3 addresses 
the link between human capital accumulation and the future of work, look-
ing more closely at why governments need to invest in human capital and 
why they often fail to do so. 
Chapter 3 also introduces the World Bank’s new human capital project. 
To ensure effective policy design and delivery, more information and better 
measurement of foundational human capital are needed, even when there 
is full willingness to invest in human capital. The project has three compo-
nents: a global benchmark—the human capital index; a program of mea-
surement and research to inform policy action; and a program of support for 
country strategies to accelerate investment in human capital.
The index is measured in terms of the amount of human capital that 
a child born in 2018 can expect to attain by the end of secondary school, 
taking into account the risks of poor health and poor education that prevail 
in the country in which the child was born during that same year. In other 
words, it measures the productivity of the next generation of workers rel-
ative to a benchmark of complete education and full health. For example, 
in many education systems a year of schooling produces only a fraction of 
the learning that is possible (figure O.7). Chapter 3 presents cross-country 
comparisons for 157 economies globally. 

Overview    |    13
Part of the ongoing skills re­­
adjustment is happening outside 
of compulsory education and 
formal jobs. But where? Chap-
ter 4 answers this question by 
exploring three domains—early 
childhood, tertiary education, 
and adult learning outside jobs—
where people acquire specific 
skills that the changing nature of 
work requires. 
Investments in early child-
hood, including in nutrition, 
health, protection, and educa-
tion, lay strong foundations for 
the future acquisition of higher- 
order cognitive and sociobehav-
ioral skills. From the prenatal 
period to age 5, the brain’s ability 
to learn from experience is at its 
highest. Individuals who acquire 
such skills in early childhood 
are more resilient to uncertainty 
later in life. Tertiary education is 
another opportunity for individ-
uals to acquire the higher-order general cognitive skills—such as complex 
problem-solving, critical thinking, and advanced communication—that are 
so important to the changing nature of work but cannot be acquired through 
schooling alone. 
As for the current stock of workers, especially those who cannot go back 
to school or to university, reskilling and upskilling those who are not in 
school or in formal jobs must be part of the response to technology-induced 
labor market disruption. But only rarely do adult learning programs get it 
right. Adults face various binding constraints that limit the effectiveness of 
traditional approaches to learning. Better diagnosis and evaluation of adult 
learning programs, along with better design and better delivery of those 
programs, are needed. Chapter 4 explores these issues in greater detail.
Work is the next venue for human capital accumulation after school. 
Chapter 5 evaluates how successful economies have been in generating 
human capital at work. Advanced economies have higher returns to work 
than emerging economies. A worker in an emerging economy is more likely 
than a worker in an advanced economy to find herself in a manual occupa-
tion that is composed largely of physical tasks. An additional year of work 
in cognitive professions increases wages by 3 percent, whereas for manual 
occupations the figure is 2 percent. Work provides a venue for a prolonged 
acquisition of skills after school—but such opportunities are relatively rare 
in emerging economies.

Governments can raise the returns to work by creating formal jobs for the 
poor. They can do this by nurturing an enabling environment for business, 
investing in entrepreneurship training for adults, and increasing access to 
technology. The payoff to women’s participation in the workforce is signifi-
cantly lower than for men—in other words, women acquire significantly 
less human capital than men do from work. To bridge that gap, governments 
could seek to remove limitations on the type or nature of work available 
to women and eliminate rules that would limit women’s property rights. 
Workers in rural areas face similar challenges when it comes to accumulating 
human capital after school. There is some scope for improving the returns 
to work by reallocating labor from villages to cities. However, in rural areas 
technology can be harnessed to increase payoffs to work by increasing agri-
cultural productivity.
Uncertain labor markets call for strengthening social protection. This topic 
is explored in chapter 6. Traditional provisions of social protection based on 
steady wage employment, clear definitions of employers and employees, 
and a fixed point of retirement are becoming increasingly obsolete. In devel-
oping countries, where informality is the norm, this model has been largely 
aspirational. 
Spending on social assistance should be complemented with insurance 
that does not fully depend on having formal wage employment. The aim of 
this approach is to expand coverage while giving priority to the poorest peo-
ple. As people become better protected through enhanced social assistance 
and insurance, labor regulation could, where appropriate, be rebalanced to 
facilitate work transitions. 
Changes in the nature of work, compounded by rising aspirations, make it 
essential to increase social inclusion. To do so, a social contract should have at 
its center equality of opportunity. Chapter 7 considers potential elements of a 
social contract, which include investing early in human capital, taxing firms, 
expanding social protection, and increasing productive opportunities for youth. 
To achieve social inclusion, some emerging economy governments will have 
to devise ways to increase revenue. Chapter 7 describes how governments can 
create fiscal space through a mix of additional revenues from existing and new 
funding sources. Potential sources of revenue are imposing value added taxes, 
excise taxes, and carbon taxes; charging platform companies taxes equal to 
what other companies are paying; and revisiting energy subsidies.

CHAPTER 1
The changing nature  
of work

F
rom their beginning, robots were intended to replace humans in the 
workplace. In fact, Karel Cˇapek, the Czech writer who invented the 
word robot in 1920, used the Slavic-language word for work, robota, 
to make it clear what these machines would be used for. Over the 
last century, machines have replaced workers in many tasks. On balance, 
however, technology has created more jobs than it has displaced. Technol-
ogy has brought higher labor productivity to many sectors by reducing the 
demand for workers for routine tasks. And yet in doing so, it has opened 
doors to new sectors once imagined only in the world of science fiction. 
As technology advances, firms adopt new methods of production, mar-
kets expand, and societies evolve. Firms rely on new technologies to better 
use capital, overcome information barriers, outsource, and innovate. New 
technologies allow for more efficient management of the operations of firms: 
firms hire workers in one location to produce parts, in another location to 
assemble, and in a third location to sell. Meanwhile, consumers enjoy a 
wider range of products at lower prices. 
In today’s economy, market opportunities are growing for all partici-
pants. Some platform firms1 are creating new marketplaces to trade goods 
or services. Even small firms are global. And they are growing faster. The 
firms selling on eBay in Chile, Jordan, Peru, and South Africa are younger 
than the firms in offline markets.2 In China, start-ups are dominant on the 
Alibaba platform.3 Societies benefit as technology increases the options for 
service delivery and for citizens to hold their governments accountable.
Workers, firms, and governments are building new comparative advan-
tages as conditions change. For example, by being the first to adopt 3-D 
technologies, Danish firms strengthened their hold on the global market 
for hearing aid products in the 2000s.4 The Indian government invested in 
technical universities across the country, and subsequently India became a 
world leader in high-tech sectors. By integrating into global value chains, 
Vietnamese workers developed their foreign-language abilities, building 
additional human capital that allows them to expand into other markets. 
Notwithstanding the opportunities, however, there are still disruptions. 
The declining cost of machines especially puts at risk those workers in low-
skill jobs engaged in routine tasks. These are the occupations most suscep-
tible to automation. Displaced workers are likely to compete with (other) 
low-skill workers for jobs with low wages. Even when new jobs are created, 
retooling is costly, and often impossible. 
The resulting displacement of workers generates anxiety, just as in the 
past. In 1589, Queen Elizabeth I of England was alarmed when clergyman 
William Lee applied for a royal patent for a knitting machine: “Consider 
thou what the invention would do to my poor subjects,” she pointed out. 
“It would assuredly bring them to ruin by depriving them of employment.”5 
In the 1880s, the Qing dynasty fiercely opposed constructing railways in 
China, arguing that the loss of luggage-carrying jobs might lead to social 
turmoil.6 Earlier in the 19th century, the Luddites sabotaged machines to 
18

defend their jobs in England, despite the overall economic growth fueled 
by steam power.
Fears of robot-induced unemployment have dominated discussions about 
the future of work. Nowhere are these fears more evident than in the indus-
trial sector. The decline in industrial employment in some high-income 
economies over the last two decades is an established trend. The Republic of 
Korea, Singapore, Spain, and the United Kingdom are among the countries 
in which the share of industrial employment dropped more than 10 percent-
age points. But this trend mainly reflects a shift in employment from manu-
facturing to services as those countries grow. By contrast, millions of indus-
trial jobs have been created in developing countries since the late 1980s. 
Indeed, the share of industrial employment has increased significantly in 
a few emerging markets such as Cambodia and Vietnam. On average, the 
share of industrial employment has remained stable in developing countries, 
despite the many predictions of job losses resulting from technology.
That said, technology is disrupting the demand for skills. Globally, private 
returns to educationabout 9 percent a yearremain high despite the sig-
nificant expansion in the supply of skilled labor. Returns to tertiary educa-
tion are almost 15 percent a year. Individuals with more advanced skills are 
taking better advantage of new technologies to adapt to the changing nature 
of work. For example, returns to primary schooling in India increased during 
the Green Revolution of the 1960s and 1970s, with more educated farmers 
adopting new technologies.
Technology has the potential to improve living standards, but its effects 
are not manifesting themselves equally across the globe. The process of job 
creation works societywide—and not just for the few—only when the rules 
of the game are fair. Workers in some sectors benefit handsomely from 
technological progress, whereas those in others are displaced and have to 
retool to survive. Platform technologies create huge wealth but place it in 
the hands of only a few people.
Irrespective of technological progress, persistent informality continues to 
pose the greatest challenge for emerging economies. Informal employment 
remains at more than 70 percent in Sub-Saharan Africa and 60 percent 
in South Asia and at more than 50 percent in Latin America. In India, the 
informal sector has remained at around 90 percent, notwithstanding fast 
economic growth and technology adoption. Both wages and productivity 
are significantly lower in the informal sector. Informal workers have neither 
health insurance nor social protection. Technology may prevent Africa and 
South Asia from industrializing in a manner that moves workers to the for-
mal sector. 
Progress in the context of the formal–informal worker divide must be 
reevaluated because of the changing nature of work. Economic growth 
depends on human capital accumulation and infrastructure that responds 
to the needs of education, health, and business. Enhanced social protection 
that applies no matter the form of labor contract is also ripe for consideration.

Technology generates jobs
“They’re always polite, they always upsell, they never take a vacation, they 
never show up late, there’s never a slip-and-fall, or an age, sex, or race 
discrimination case,” said Andrew Puzder, then chief executive of Hardee’s 
Food Systems Inc., a restaurant chain headquartered in Tennessee. He was 
talking about swapping employees for machines.7 Statements like these give 
workers reason to worry.
The advent of a jobless economy raises concern because tasks tradition-
ally performed by humans are being—or are at risk of being—taken over 
by robots, especially those enabled with artificial intelligence. The number 
of robots operating worldwide is rising quickly. By 2019, 1.4 million new 
industrial robots will be in operation, raising the total to 2.6 million world-
wide.8 Robot density per worker in 2018 is the highest in Germany, Korea, 
and Singapore. Yet in all of these countries, despite the high prevalence of 
robots, the employment rate remains high. 
Young workers may be more affected by automation than older workers. 
Although the adoption of robots did not have any substantial net effect on 
employment in Germany, it reduced the hiring of young entrants.9 For this 
reason, the effects of automation can be different in countries that are aging 
compared with those that have young populations and anticipate large 
numbers of new labor market entrants. 
Yes, robots are replacing workers, but it is far from clear to what extent. 
Overall, technological change that replaces routine work is estimated to 
have created more than 23 million jobs across Europe from 1999 to 2016, 
or almost half of the total increase in employment over the same period. 
Recent evidence for European countries suggests that although technology 
may be replacing workers in some jobs, overall it raises the demand for 
labor.10 For example, instead of hiring traditional loan officers, JD Finance, 
a leading fintech platform in China, created more than 3,000 risk manage-
ment or data analysis jobs to sharpen algorithms for digitized lending.
Technological progress leads to the direct creation of jobs in the technol-
ogy sector. People are increasingly using smartphones, tablets, and other 
portable electronic devices to work, organize their finances, secure and heat 
their homes, and have fun. Workers create the online interfaces that drive 
this growth. With consumer interests changing fast, there are more oppor-
tunities for people to pursue careers in mobile app development and virtual 
reality design. 
Technology has also facilitated the creation of jobs through working 
online or joining the so-called gig economy. Andela, a U.S. company that 
specializes in training software developers, has built its business model on 
the digitization of Africa. It has trained 20,000 software programmers across 
Africa using free online learning tools. Once qualified, programmers work 
with Andela directly or join other Andela clients across the world. The com-
pany aims to train 100,000 African software developers by 2024. Ninety 
percent of its workers are in Lagos, Nigeria, with other sites in Nairobi, 
Kenya, as well as Kampala, Uganda.

Technology increases proximity to markets, facilitating the creation of 
new, efficient value chains. In Ghana, Farmerline is an online platform that 
communicates with a network of more than 200,000 farmers in their native 
languages via mobile phone. It provides information on the weather and 
market prices, while collecting data for buyers, governments, and develop-
ment partners. The company is expanding to include credit services. 
During this process of technology adoption some workers will be replaced 
by technology. Workers involved in routine tasks that are “codifiable” are 
the most vulnerable. The examples are numerous. More than two-thirds 
of robots are employed in the automotive, electrical/electronics, and metal 
and machinery industries. Based in China, Foxconn Technology Group, the 
world’s largest electronics assembler, cut its workforce by 30 percent when 
it introduced robots into the production process. When robots are cheaper 
than the existing manufacturing processes, firms become more amenable 
to relocating production closer to consumer markets. In 2017 3-D printing 
technologies enabled the German company Adidas to establish two “speed 
factories” for shoe production: one in Ansbach, Germany, and the other in 
Atlanta in the United States, eliminating more than 1,000 jobs in Vietnam. 
In 2012 the Dutch multinational technology company Philips Electronics 
shifted production from China back to the Netherlands. 
Some service jobs are also vulnerable to automation. Mobileye of Israel 
is developing driverless vehicle navigation units. Baidu, the Chinese tech-
nology giant, is working with King Long Motor Group, China, to introduce 
autonomous buses in industrial parks. Financial analysts, who spend much 
of their time conducting formula-based research, are also experiencing job 
cuts: Sberbank, the largest bank in the Russian Federation, relies on artifi-
cial intelligence to make 35 percent of its loan decisions, and it anticipates 
raising that rate to 70 percent in less than five years.11 “Robot lawyers” have 
already replaced 3,000 human employees in Sberbank’s legal department. 
The number of back-office employees will shrink to 1,000 by 2021, down 
from 59,000 in 2011. Ant Financial, a fintech firm in China, uses big data 
to assess loan agreements instead of hiring thousands of loan officers or 
lawyers.
Nevertheless, it is impossible to put a figure on the level of job displace-
ment that will take place overall. Even the most well-known economists 
have experienced little success with this exercise. In 1930 John Maynard 
Keynes declared that technology would usher in an age of leisure and abun-
dance within a hundred years. He mused that everyone would have to do 
some work if they were to be content, but that three hours a day would be 
quite enough.12 The world in 2018 is far from this kind of reality. 
Although quantifying the impact of technological progress on job losses 
continues to challenge economists, estimates abound. Those estimates vary 
widely (figure 1.1). For Bolivia, job automation estimates range from 2 to 
41 percent. In other words, anywhere from 100,000 to 2 million Bolivian 
jobs may be automated in 2018. The range is even wider for advanced 
economies. In Lithuania, from 5 to 56 percent of jobs are at risk of being 
automated. In Japan, from 6 to 55 percent of jobs are thought to be at risk. 

22    |    WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2019
The wide range of predictions illustrates the difficulty of estimating tech-
nology's impact on jobs. Most estimates rely on automation probabilities 
developed by machine learning experts at the University of Oxford. The 
experts were asked to categorize a sample of 70 occupations taken from the 
O*NET online job database used by the U.S. Department of Labor as either 
strictly automatable or not (1–0).13 Relying on these probabilities, initial 
estimates placed 47 percent of U.S. occupations at risk of automation. Bas-
ing probabilities on the opinion of experts is instructive but not definitive. 
Moreover, using one country’s occupational categories to estimate possible 
job losses from automation elsewhere is problematic. 
Job loss predictions do not accurately incorporate technology absorp-
tion rates, which are often painstakingly slow and differ not only between 
countries but also across firms within countries. The absorption rate 
therefore affects the potential for technology to destroy jobs. The use of 
mobile telephony, for example, spread faster than earlier technologies, 
but the Internet has been comparatively slow to take hold in many cases, 
particularly among firms in the informal sector. The uptake of mechaniza-
tion in agriculture presents a similar picture. Persistent trade barriers, the 
relatively low cost of labor compared with that of agricultural machinery, 
and poor information all contribute to the low rates of mechanization in 
low-income and some middle-income countries. Even for the textile indus-
try’s spinning jenny, the relatively low cost of labor delayed its introduc-
tion in France and Indiain 1790 France had only 900 spinning jennies 
compared with 20,000 in Great Britain.14 The prevalence of automation 
versus labor continues to vary across and within countries, depending on 
the context.

How work is changing
It is easier to assess how technology shapes the demand for skills and changes 
production processes than it is to estimate its effect on job losses. Technology 
is changing the skills being rewarded in the labor market. The premium is 
rising for skills that cannot be replaced by robots—general cognitive skills 
such as critical thinking and sociobehavioral skills such as managing and 
recognizing emotions that enhance teamwork. Workers with these skills are 
more adaptable in labor markets. Technology is also disrupting production 
processes by challenging the traditional boundaries of firms, expanding 
global value chains, and changing the geography of jobs. Finally, technology 
is changing how people work, giving rise to the gig economy in which orga-
nizations contract with independent workers for short-term engagements.
Technology is disrupting the demand for three types of skills in the work-
place. First, the demand for nonroutine cognitive and sociobehavioral skills 
appears to be rising in both advanced and emerging economies. Second, 
the demand for routine job-specific skills is declining. And, third, payoffs to 
combinations of different skill types appear to be increasing. These changes 
show up not just through new jobs replacing old jobs, but also through the 
changing skills profile of existing jobs (figure 1.2).
Since 2001, the share of employment in occupations intensive in nonrou-
tine cognitive and sociobehavioral skills has increased from 19 to 23 percent

in emerging economies and from 33 to 41 percent in advanced economies. In 
Vietnam, within a given industry workers performing nonroutine analytical 
tasks earn 23 percent more than those performing tasks that are nonanalyt-
ical, noninteractive, and nonmanual; those undertaking interpersonal tasks 
earn 13 percent more.15 In Armenia and Georgia, the earnings premium for 
problem solving and learning new skills at work is close to 20 percent.16 
Robots may complement workers who engage in nonroutine tasks that 
require advanced analytical, interpersonal, or manual skills requiring signif-
icant dexterity—for instance, teamwork, relationship management, people 
management, and caregiving. In these activities, people must interact with 
one another on the basis of tacit knowledge. Designing, producing art, con-
ducting research, managing teams, nursing, and cleaning have proven to be 
hard tasks to automate. Robots have for the most part struggled to replicate 
these skills to compete with workers. 
Machines replace workers most easily when it comes to routine tasks that 
are codifiable. Some of these tasks are cognitive, such as processing payrolls 
or bookkeeping. Others are manual or physical, such as operating weld-
ing machines, assembling goods, or driving forklifts. These tasks are easily 
automated. In Norway, the adoption by firms of information and commu-
nications technologies benefited skilled workers in executing nonroutine 
abstract tasks but replaced unskilled workers.17
Payoffs for combinations of different skill types are also increasing. The 
changing nature of work demands skill sets that improve the adaptability of 
workers, allowing them to transfer easily from one job to another. Across 
countries, both higher-order cognitive (technical) skills and sociobehavioral 
skills are consistently ranked among the skills most valued by employers. 
Employers in Benin, Liberia, Malawi, and Zambia rank teamwork, commu-
nication, and problem-solving skills as the most important set of skills after 
technical skills.18
Even within a given occupation, the impact of technology on the skills 
required to perform a job is changingbut not always in the direction one 
might expect. In Chile, the adoption of sophisticated computer software 
for client management and business operations between 2007 and 2013 
decreased the demand for workers to complete abstract tasks and increased 
the demand for workers to complete routine manual tasks. As a result, there 
was a reallocation of employment from skilled workers to administrative, 
unskilled production workers.19 
In advanced economies, employment has been growing fastest in high-
skill cognitive occupations and low-skill occupations that require dexterity. 
By contrast, employment has shifted away from middle-skill occupations 
such as machine operators. This is one of the factors that may translate  
into rising inequality in advanced economies. Both middle- and low-skill 
workers could see falling wagesthe former because of auto­mation; the 
latter because of increased competition.
Few studies have been made of emerging economies, but some of those that 
have been made reveal similar changes in employment. In middle-income 

The changing nature of work    |    25
European countries such as Bulgaria and Romania, the demand for workers 
in occupations involving nonroutine cognitive and interpersonal skills is ris-
ing, while the demand for workers in lower-skill nonroutine manual occu-
pations has remained steady.20 The use of routine cognitive skills has also 
increased in Botswana, Ethiopia, Mongolia, the Philippines, and Vietnam.21 
Studies observe that the demand for nonroutine cognitive and interpersonal 
skills is largely rising much faster than for other skills. High-skill workers are 
gaining with technological change, whereas low-skill workers—especially 
those in manual jobs—seem to be losing out. 
Other studies show that changes in employment have been positive. In 
Argentina, the adoption of information and communications technologies 
in manufacturing increased employment turnover: workers were replaced, 
occupations were eliminated, new occupations were created, and the share 
of unskilled workers fell. However, employment levels increased across all 
skill categories.22
Technology is also disrupting production processes, challenging the tra-
ditional boundaries of firms and expanding global value chains. In doing 
so, technology changes the geography of jobs. Other waves of technological 
change have done the same. The Industrial Revolution, which mechanized 
agricultural production, automated manufacturing, and expanded exports, 
led to the mass migration of labor from farms to cities. The advent of com-
mercial passenger planes expanded tourism from local holiday destinations 
in Northern Europe to new foreign resorts on the Mediterranean Sea. Thou-
sands of new jobs were created in new locations. 
Improvements in transcontinental communications technologies, along 
with the fall in transportation costs, have expanded global value chains 
toward East Asia. But many other factors beyond technology also matter 
for outsourcing. The Philippines overtook India in 2017 in terms of market 
share in the call center business at least in part because of the country’s 
lower taxes. 
Meanwhile, technology is enabling clusters of business to form in under-
developed rural areas. In China, rural micro e-tailers began to emerge in 
2009 on Taobao.com Marketplace. Owned by Alibaba, it is one of the largest 
online retail platforms in China. These clusters—“Taobao Villages”—spread 
fast, from just 3 in 2009 to 2,118 across 28 provinces in 2017. In 2017 
490,000 shops were online. Although sales have been strongest in tradi-
tional goods such as apparel, furniture, shoes, luggage, leather goods, and 
auto accessories, sellers are diversifying their offerings to include high-tech 
goods such as drones.
Online work platforms are eliminating many of the geographical barriers 
previously associated with certain tasks. Bangladesh contributes 15 percent 
to the global labor pool online by means of its 650,000 freelance workers.23 
Indiez, founded in 2016 in India, takes a team-based approach to online 
freelancing. The platform provides a remotely distributed community of tal-
ent—mainly from India, Southeast Asia, and Eastern Europe—that works 
together on tech projects for clients anywhere in the world. Clients include 

26    |    WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2019
the pizza restaurant chain Domino’s India, as well as the Indian multinational 
conglomerate Aditya Birla Group. Wonderlabs in Indonesia follows a similar 
model. 
Finally, technology is changing how people work and the terms under 
which they work. Instead of the once standard long-term contracts, digital 
technologies are giving rise to more short-term work, often via online work 
platforms. These so-called gigs make certain kinds of work more accessible 
on a more flexible basis. More widespread access to digital infrastructure—
via laptops, tablets, and smartphones—provides an enabling environment in 
which on-demand services can thrive. Examples range from grocery delivery 
and driving services to sophisticated tasks such as accounting, editing, and 
music production. Asuqu in Nigeria connects creatives and other experts 
with businesses across Africa. Crew Pencil works in the South African movie 
industry. Tutorama, based in the Arab Republic of Egypt, connects students 
with local private tutors. In Russia, students work as Yandex drivers when-
ever they can fit it in to their university schedules. They identify peak hours 
in different locations to achieve the highest level of passenger turnover. 
It is difficult to estimate the size of the gig economy. Where data exist, the 
numbers are still small. Data from Germany and the Netherlands indicate 
that only 0.4 percent of the labor force of those countries is active in the gig 
economy. Worldwide, the total freelancer population is estimated at around 
84 million, or less than 3 percent of the global labor force of 3.5 billion.24 A 
person counted as a freelancer may also engage in traditional employment. 
In the United States, for example, more than two-thirds of the 57.3 million 
freelancers also hold a traditional job, using freelancing to supplement their 
income.25 The best estimate is that less than 0.5 percent of the active labor 
force participates in the gig economy globally, with less than 0.3 percent in 
developing countries.
Changes in the nature of work are in some ways more noticeable in 
advanced economies where technology is widespread and labor markets 
start from higher levels of formalization. However, emerging economies 
have been grappling with many of the same changes for decades. As noted 
earlier, informality persists on a vast scale in emerging economies—as high 
as 90 percent in some low- and middle-income countries—notwithstanding 
technological progress. With some notable exceptions in Eastern Europe, 
informality has been hard to tackle. In countries such as El Salvador, 
Morocco, and Tanzania only one out of five workers is in the formal sector. 
On average, two out of three workers in emerging economies are informal 
workers (figure 1.3).
The prevalence of informality predates the new millennium wave of tech-
nological change. Various programs for reducing informality, inspired by 
Hernando de Soto’s The Other Path: The Economic Answer to Terrorism (2002), 
have yielded limited progress. The reason is the onerous regulations, taxes, 
and social protection schemes that give businesses no incentive to grow. 
Because recent technological developments are blurring the divide 
between formal and informal work, there is something of a convergence 

The changing nature of work    |    27
in the nature of work between advanced and emerging economies. Labor 
markets are becoming more fluid in advanced economies, while informality 
is persisting in emerging economies. Most of the challenges faced by short-
term or temporary workers, even in advanced economies, are the same as 
those faced by workers in the informal sector. Self-employment, informal 
wage work with no written contracts or protections, and low-productivity 
jobs more generally are the norm in most of the developing world. These 
workers operate in a regulatory gray area, with most labor laws unclear 
on the roles and responsibilities of the employer versus the employee. This 
group of workers often lacks access to benefits. There are no pensions, no 
health or unemployment insurance schemes, and none of the protections 
provided to formal workers. 
This type of convergence is not what was expected in the 21st century. 
Traditionally, economic development has been synonymous with formal-
ization. This is reflected in the design of social protection systems and labor 
regulations. A formal wage employment contract is still the most common 
basis for the protections afforded by social insurance programs and by regu-
lations such as those specifying a minimum wage or severance pay. Changes 
in the nature of work caused by technology shift the pattern of demanding 
workers’ benefits from employers to directly demanding welfare benefits 
from the state. These changes raise questions about the ongoing relevance 
of current labor laws.

A simple model of changing work
Will robots turn the old Luddite fears of machines replacing workers into real-
ity? Will massive automation mean that the old path of prosperity-through- 
industrialization, once taken by China, Japan, and the United Kingdom, is 
closing? How can public policy ensure that the evolution of work produces a 
world that is both more prosperous and more equitable?26
High labor costs in relation to capital—beyond a certain level—push firms 
to automate production or to move jobs to lower-cost countries (figure 
1.4). This reduction in costs is achieved explicitly within a firm or implicitly 
through competition within a market. The relative cost of labor, not income, 
is emphasized because countries may have labor costs that do not align with 
their income level. This is the case, for example, in countries where low 
levels of human capital render workers unproductive, reducing exporting 
potential, or in countries where regulations significantly raise labor costs for 
formal employers.
A response to globalization is a greater shift in jobs to developing country 
cities, thereby reducing the overall relative costs of labor (and shifting the 
curve in figure 1.4 leftward). Automation leads to less demand for man-
ufacturing workers everywhere (shifting the curve downward). Automa-
tion also changes the overall relationship between industrial employment 
and labor costs because it occurs more quickly in locations with high labor 
costs, assuming the incentive to reduce labor costs trumps other differences 
between locations (changing the shape of the curves in figure 1.4 from left-
skewed to right-skewed). 
Keynes  understood that employment in the traditional sectors, especially 
agriculture, would decline enormously in the 20th century, but he failed to 
anticipate the explosion of new products that 21st-century workers would pro-
duce and consume. Most import-
ant of all, he failed to foresee the 
vast service economy that would 
employ workers in most wealthy 
countries. Digital technologies 
are enabling firms to automate, 
replacing labor with machines 
in production, and to innovate, 
expanding the number of tasks 
and products. The future of work 
will be determined by the battle 
between automation and inno-
vation (figure 1.5). In response 
to automation, employment in 
old sectors declines. In response 
to innovation, new sectors or 
tasks emerge. The overall future 
of employment depends on both. 
It also depends on the labor and

Note: The curves are inverse U-shaped to reflect the empirical 
regularity that manufacturing employment constitutes a larger 
share of employment in middle-income countries; higher-income 
countries tend to specialize in services; and low-income countries

skills intensity of the new sectors 
or tasks that emerge. These forces 
in turn affect wages.
For most of the last 40 years, 
human capital has served as a 
shield against automation, in 
part because machines are less 
adept at replicating more com-
plex tasks. Low-skill and middle- 
skill workers have benefited less 
from technological change either 
because of higher sus­cepti­bility 
to automation or because of 
lower complementarities with 
technology.27 
What is the result? Auto-
mation has disproportionately 
reduced the demand for less 
skilled workers, and the inno-
vation process has generally 
favored the more educated. A 
big question is whether workers displaced by automation will have the 
required skills for new jobs created by innovation. This study focuses on the 
importance of human capital for the workforce of the future. Yet it is worth 
remembering that many innovations, such as Henry Ford’s assembly lines, 
increased the demand for less skilled workers, while others, such as quartz 
watches, disproportionately destroyed jobs for higher-skill workers. 
Automation and innovation are largely the unexpected by-products of 
a single breakthrough, such as the advent of the Internet, or the result of 
more targeted investments by companies that are seeking to either reduce 
labor costs or increase profits in new markets. If public regulations limit 
innovation, employment is more likely to fall. 
In the mid-20th century, automation in the form of dishwashers and 
washing machines revolutionized homemaking, enabling millions of women 
to work outside the household. Women often found jobs in the service econ-
omy, which grew by providing yet more products and services, from caffe 
lattes to financial planning, and enabling an even finer division of labor such 
as personal trainers and financial market traders. A major question for this 
century is whether more of these services will become tradable and whether 
service workers will locate in the same metropolitan area as their clients. 
The battle between innovation and automation is raging not just in the U.S. 
and European rust belts. Even though low-wage countries may not invest in 
the development of labor-saving innovations, they import labor-saving ideas 
from advanced economies. In fact, the mechanization of agriculture in emerg-
ing economies represents the largest global shift in work. Cities in emerging 
countries must generate abundant new jobs to employ the farmers displaced 
by the industrialization of agriculture. The declining costs of transportation

and connectivity (so-called globalization) enable these urban job markets to 
expand, as long as connectivity spreads more quickly than the automation 
of tradable goods production. So, although the growth of employment in 
emerging economies is supported by global value chains, automation may 
mean that African countries never experience mass industrialization. 
The dramatic economic growth experienced by China, Japan, Korea, and 
Vietnam started with the fruits of globalization: manufacturing exports that 
competed effectively because of low labor costs. These countries chose to 
invest in infrastructure, special economic zones, and, above all, human capital, 
which generated a high-quality labor force connected to the outside world.
The transition of Shenzhen, China, from labor-intensive, low-cost man-
ufacturing to high-skilled, technologically intense production illustrates 
the challenge that later industrializers are facing. They must compete not 
only with the high labor cost, capital-intensive producers of the wealthy 
West, but also with the moderate labor cost, technology-intensive producers 
of Asia and Eastern Europe. If robust global connections arrive too slowly 
in Africa, then industrialization may no longer be a plausible path to job  
creation. This threat strengthens the case for investing promptly in the pre-
cursors of globalization: education and transportation infrastructure.28 
If African cities maintain the current model, employment will remain 
in the low-wage informal service sector. Changing the model depends sig-
nificantly on investments in human capital (figure 1.6). In that case, Africa 
may urbanize as a services-producing economy, moving away from export 
earnings based on natural resources and agriculture. 
Globalization increases the returns to human capital through higher 
labor productivity; some workers participate in export industries, and 
the shift of workers to those industries increases the demand for all kinds  
of labor (figure 1.6). This positive shift is meant to capture the positive 
experience of a poorer nation that has suddenly gained access to signif-
icant foreign direct investment. 
Of course, globalization may not 
always raise productivity across 
the board. 
Likewise, the benefits of glo-
balization will not accrue evenly. 
Globalization causes the variance 
in labor productivity to increase. 
Although productivity for sub-
sistence farmers is low and rela-
tively homogeneous, the returns 
to participating in a globalized 
economy are far more mixed. By 
investing strongly in raising the 
human capital of their citizens, 
governments increase their citi-
zens’ chances of success in global 
markets.

The changing nature of work    |    31
The vertical lines in figure 1.6 denote the minimum productivity level 
at which firms find it optimal to employ workers formally before the move 
toward globalization. A minimum wage, required benefits, and other taxes 
and regulations ensure that informality is appealing for all but the most 
productive workers before the economy grows. If regulations remained con-
stant, globalization and automation would in many cases pull more work-
ers into the formal sector by increasing their productivity. Yet this formal 
employment effect may be reduced if development prompts countries to 
impose more requirements on firms. Globalization raises incomes, but it 
may not do much to reduce informality if regulatory aspirations increase 
along with global connections. Indeed, informality could even rise if global-
ization sufficiently increases regulation. 
Finally, policy makers have to think about risk management because of 
the predominance of informality in developing countries and the higher 
uncertainty associated with the changing nature of work. The large continu-
ing presence of a vast informal service sector challenges risk management 
systems that function through employers. Financing pensions and other 
forms of insurance through payroll taxes levied on formal workers does little 
good if these workers represent only a small share of the workforce. Strong 
requirements also deter formalization. 
This study emphasizes the importance for social inclusion for all workers 
regardless of how or where they work. Governments could try to strengthen 
social protection and reduce inequality through requirements or subsi-
dies for employer-provided support such as a minimum wage, employer- 
provided health care, or protection against dismissal. Alternatively, govern-
ments could pursue the same goals through direct, state-provided support in 
the form of social assistance programs and subsidized universal social insur-
ance or public jobs for, say, community health workers. 
Both types of social policy promote equity. And both have costs. From 
the state’s perspective, different combinations of regulations and public aid 
generate the same level of equity. Direct public aid generates implementa-
tion costs through waste and higher tax rates. Employer requirements deter 
hiring and could, if too stringent, raise inequity by increasing the share of 
workers who are either unemployed or in the informal sector. 
Many developing countries initially chose to redistribute primarily 
through labor market regulations because the costs of distorting labor mar-
kets were low and the public capacity for social programs was limited. If 
automation pushes up the cost of distorting labor markets, and development 
improves the efficacy of the public sector, government should move away 
from regulation-based redistribution to direct social welfare support.  
The future world of work is uncertain. Innovation may outpace automa-
tion. Globalization may move quickly enough that industrialization allows 
Africa to grow and prosper. Yet, given the considerable uncertainty about 
the future of employment, governments should rethink policies that deter 
job creation, and emphasize policies that protect the vulnerable while still 
encouraging employment.

CHAPTER 2
The changing nature  
of firms

H
istorically, firms have operated within boundaries. The British  
economist Ronald Coase explained this phenomenon in his 1937 
article “The Nature of the Firm.”1 He observed that firms in Detroit 
grew only so long as it was cheaper for them to complete addi-
tional parts of the production process in-house rather than resort to the  
open market.
In 2018 firms operate within wider boundaries. Free trade agreements 
and improved infrastructure have reduced the cost of cross-border trade, 
allowing transactions to take place wherever costs are lower.2 New technol-
ogies have lowered communication costs. As a result, firms are less verti-
cally integratedmanagers are outsourcing more tasks to the market. Some 
companies are even creating new markets. For example, JD.com, China’s 
second-largest e-commerce company, has more than 170,000 online mer-
chants on its platform, many in rural areas.
The wider boundaries of firms have evolved gradually. One only has to 
compare the Ford Motor Company of the 1930s with the Inter IKEA Group 
of 2018 to observe how firm boundaries have expanded over time. Henry 
Ford owned the sheep farms that supplied the wool for his com­pany’s auto-
mobile seat covers. He also owned the iron ore and coal freighters that fed 
the company’s sprawling River Rouge manufacturing complex near Detroit. 
The company itself maintained most of the transactions related to car man-
ufacturing in-house because the transaction costs were higher to find an 
outside supplier able to customize auto parts.
As for IKEA, vertical integration within Sweden gave ground to globaliza-
tion in the 1980s and 1990s. The international expansion of IKEA, founded 
in Sweden in 1943, began with the establishment of small stores in Norway 
in 1963 and then in Denmark in 1969. The reduction in tariff and nontariff 
barriers allowed IKEA to set up global value chains. The advent of Internet 
technology transformed these chains into global networks: IKEA procures 
many of its products through online bidding. Firms from around the world 
become part of IKEA’s network of suppliers.
Firms such as IKEA would have made Austrian economist Joseph  
Schumpeter proud. Capitalism requires “the perennial gale of creative 
destruction,” wrote Schumpeter in 1942.3 He did not worry about whether 
jobs might be lost in the process. Politicians do. 
As the boundaries of firms have expanded, the corporate labor share has 
declinedin 75 percent of advanced countries and 59 percent of emerging 
economies between 1975 and 2012.4 The World Bank, using total labor shares  
from Penn World Tables, including the self-employed and government sec-
tors, has calculated a decline in two-thirds of 76 developing countries.
Governments are struggling to respond to this decline and often blame 
the rise of large firms to explain it. Politicians are trying to create jobs by 
financing programs for the development of small and medium enterprises. 
However, these programs are rarely cost-effective. They are based on the 
belief that small and medium enterprises create stable jobs, and yet the evi-
dence shows that large firms account for the largest proportion of stable jobs 
in many economies.5

The changing nature of firms    |    37
A better solution is to ease the barriers for start-ups to encourage compet-
itive markets. Start-ups require a business-friendly environment that does 
not favor large private firms already in a market for some time (incum-
bents) and state-owned enterprises or firms run by government officials, 
their associates, or relatives. A small number of start-ups will become the 
next superstar firms. 
Technological change favors the most productive firms in each industry, 
incentivizing the reallocation of resources toward them. Digital technologies 
allow for fast scaling. Jamalon, an online book retailer since 2010 in Amman, 
Jordan, has been able, with fewer than 100 staff, to establish partnerships 
with over 3,000 Arabic-language and 27,000 English-language publishers, 
delivering 10 million titles to the Middle East region. Platform-based busi-
nesses are on the rise across the globe, providing new opportunities to trade 
goods and services.
There is much to celebrate when it comes to the rise of large firms. The 
digital economy has enabled firms to grow faster than those 20 years ago. 
But there is also much to consider with caution. First, digital markets pro-
vide new opportunities for firms to stifle their competition. U.S. economist 
Sherwin Rosen, who introduced the concept of superstar firms in 1981, pre-
dicted that technology would allow firms to expand markets or crowd out 
the competition more easily. In many markets, this prediction has proven to 
be true. Technology has allowed some companies to rise quickly to the top, 
while preventing others from rising at all. 
Second, globally integrated firms, which have “scale without mass,”6 
create new challenges for taxation. It is increasingly difficult to determine 
where value is created when businesses create value by combining networks 
of users, ideas, and production across borders. Taking advantage of interna-
tional value creation, firms are in turn better able to divert profits to low-tax 
jurisdictions. Solutions require coordination at the global level. Meanwhile, 
countries could take unilateral steps by extending value added tax regimes 
or creating new taxes for the digital economy. But it is difficult to collect 
taxes on intangible assets such as user data. More traditional tax avoidance 
schemes, through transfer pricing, are also easier in the digital economy.
Superstar firms
Large firms dominate the global economy: 10 percent of the world’s com-
panies are estimated to generate 80 percent of all profits. Superstar firms 
shape a country’s exports. One study of 32 developing countries found that, 
on average, the five largest exporters in a country account for a third of its 
exports, nearly half of export growth, and a third of growth due to export 
diversification.7
Growth is particularly strong in markets undergoing accelerated techno-
logical advances. Reduced trade barriers also encourage firms to grow by 
increasing access to new imported inputs.8 The top 1 percent of exporters 
in rich countries account for a larger share of exports—on average, 55 per-
centthan those in poorer countries (figure 2.1). 

38    |    WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2019
Large firms have a beneficial effect on economic growth. They acceler-
ate growth in developing economies by pulling resources out of subsistence 
agriculture. Large firms are at the forefront of adopting new technologies. 
They increase aggregate productivity by upgrading their internal capabili-
ties to become more efficient and drive out unproductive firms. And they 
achieve economies of scale that lower prices for consumers.
Large firms account for most formal jobs in an economy. In recent years, 
firms with more than 100 employees have accounted for 60 percent of the 
total employment share in Malaysia, Myanmar, and Vietnam. In Cambodia, 
they accounted for 70 percent. This situation plays out in other regions as 
well: large firms accounted for 53 percent of total employment in Argentina, 
46 percent in Bolivia, 62 percent in the Dominican Republic, and 54 percent 
in Ecuador.9 In Serbia, workers in the top 1 percent of manufacturing firms 
represented, on average, a quarter of total employment; the top 5 percent 
accounted for almost half of the total labor force.10 The situation is similar in 
Romania. Superstar firms tend to employ the most workers because those 
firms generate the most output, even if they are less labor-intensive than 
the average firm.11 
The importance of large firms in driving economic growth is not new. 
However, the advent of digital platforms has changed how this phenom-
enon unfolds. Digital platforms are replacing the brick-and-mortar malls,

connecting shoppers with different brand stores, creating efficiencies for 
brands, and generating revenue for platform owners. Data gathered through 
platforms are also used to improve firm efficiency, at times in markets other 
than those in which the data were collected in the first place. JD Finance, a 
financial company that is part of the Chinese JD.com Group, incorporates 
transaction data that it gains through its marketplace into its loan assess-
ment model. 
Platform-based businesses are on the rise in every country. Consider  
VIPKID, a leading Chinese online education firm founded in 2013 that 
matches 500,000 students in China with 60,000 teachers in North Amer-
ica for virtual, one-on-one English classes. Jumia, established in 2012, is 
a Nigerian e-commerce company that has already made inroads into 23 
African countries, bringing electronics, groceries, and fashion to customers. 
Flipkart in India facilitates sales of consumer electronics between suppliers 
and customers. It operates like a market, defying the boundaries of firms as 
originally described by Ronald Coase.
As noted, digital platforms allow quick scaling. Examples of billion- 
dollar start-ups built around platforms abound. In China, e-commerce giant 
JD.com started as a retail business in a tiny booth in the Zhongguancun 
Electronics Shopping Market in Beijing. In July 2018 the JD platform had 
320 million active users. Ant Financial, part of the Alibaba Group, is the 
most valuable fintech firm in the world. The firm took off within just a 
few years because of advances in artificial intelligence. Ant uses big data 
to disburse loans in less than 1 second from the moment of application. Its 
“3-1-0” online lending model involves a 3-minute application process, a 
1-second processing time, with 0 manual interventions. Since 2014, more 
than 4 million small Chinese businesses have received loans. 
Digital platforms create instant business opportunities for entrepreneurs, 
thereby creating jobs. Since 2009, many clusters of rural micro e-tailers 
have opened shop on Taobao.com Marketplace, fostering “Taobao Villages” 
in China. Taobao Village merchants produce consumer goods, agricultural 
products, and handicraft works based on their niche competencies. Taobao 
Villages have created more than 1.3 million jobs, drawing young people who 
migrated to cities back to their hometowns to start their own enterprises. 
Reliable Internet connectivity and high smartphone penetration must be in 
place for this kind of e-commerce to grow. 
Platforms expand job opportunities. In 2018 the service sector accounted 
for most jobs in several countries: its share of total employment was more 
than 70 percent in Argentina, Saudi Arabia, and Uruguay, and above 80 
percent in Hong Kong SAR, China; Israel; and Jordan. The proliferation of 
platforms is allowing freelancers to have simultaneous access to multiple 
platforms at low entry costs. Consumers are also more willing to use online 
services because they trust them, relying on brand certification, digitalized 
social capital, and third-party validations. Consumer trust enables platforms 
to expand quickly into other business lines. Grab, a Singapore-based ride- 
hailing platform, eventually captured 95 percent of the Southeast Asian 

40    |    WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2019
market before expanding to offer additional services ranging from food 
ordering to payment systems. GrabPay extends e-payment opportunities 
to an estimated two-thirds of people in the region who do not have bank 
accounts. 
Some platforms expand the supply of labor by increasing opportunities for 
new, flexible types of work that complement traditional forms of employ-
ment in the gig economy. Workers set their own hours for most platforms. 
Meanwhile, the additional income may reduce income fluctuations for sec-
ondary earners. The flexibility inherent in platform work also enables more 
women to participate in the labor force. But these features blur the line 
between formal and casual employment. Although flexibility is a benefit in 
some cases, it also raises concerns around income instability and protections 
connected with standard employer-employee relationships, including pen-
sion plans, health insurance, and paid leave. 
Finally, digital platforms enable firms to exploit underused physical and 
human capacity, transforming dead capital into active capital. For exam-
ple, ride-hailing platforms provide a way for individuals to advertise their 
free time and spare vehicle capacity—be it a luxury vehicle, a moped, or 
a tuk-tuk—to generate income. Freelancing websites enable unemployed 
computer programmers located in remote parts of the world to document 
their expertise so they can find work with companies abroad.
The rise of the digital platform firm—operating globally, existing prin-
cipally in the cloud, and often generating income from the capital of oth-
ers—marks a shift in the potential nature of firms more generally. Most reg-
ulations are not yet adapted to these changes. Platform firms often operate 
in regulatory gray areas, but minimum standards of quality, prudence, and 
safety, among other policy goals, must still be upheld by digital businesses. 
Data privacy and protection are at the center of the regulatory discussion 
because of the large amount of data accumulated, employed, and mone-
tized by platform businesses. Zoning or other laws affecting business activ-
ity may also be implicated. For example, although Airbnb frequently shifts 
tourism away from urban centers and has a positive impact on local busi-
nesses, Airbnb locations are often not subject to the same zoning or licensing 
requirements as other commercial accommodations. Nevertheless, Airbnb 
might affect neighbors who do not share the benefit of rental income.
Regulation becomes important if platforms provoke a race to the bottom 
in working conditions. In Indonesia, drivers with Go-Jek and Grab held 
large demonstrations in early 2018 demanding an increase in their tariffs. In 
response, the Indonesian government is amending its laws to require such 
firms to register as transport companies, comply with safety requirements, 
and impose a minimum floor price. In early 2018, Egyptian courts suspended 
the licenses of the ride-hailing companies Uber and Careem in response to 
a challenge by taxi drivers. Shortly thereafter, in May 2018, the Egyptian 
government passed a law to regulate ride-hailing companies, allowing Uber 
and Careem to get back on the road and compete alongside traditional taxis. 

The changing nature of firms    |    41
Competitive markets
Physical presence is no longer a prerequisite to doing business in a given 
market, particularly in the digital economy where intangible products are 
replicable at little or no cost. Expanded boundaries create opportunities for 
firms to grow, but frequently the risk of market concentration increases. 
Anticompetitive behavior is harder to identify in the digital economy. Net-
work effects often benefit early adopters of technology, facilitating the emer-
gence of monopolies. 
More start-ups mean more competition. If the business conditions are 
right, it is more likely that some start-ups will grow strongly, creating jobs. 
Faced with new competition, less productive firms—so long as they are not 
state-owned or politically connected—exit the market.12
Creating a better business environment allows more successful firms to 
rise naturally. The World Bank’s Doing Business project lays out the basic 
regulatory requirements for private initiatives to grow. These data have 
been used by researchers to study the deleterious effects of burdensome 
regulation. Poverty rates are lower in countries that have business-friendly 
regulations.13
A country with a business-friendly environment also has more start-up 
activity and job creation. When Mexico simplified business registration, the 
number of new businesses increased by 5 percent, and wage employment 
went up by 2.2 percent.14 Higher start-up costs may also lead to lower over-
all productivity: in the absence of competition, firms that are already in a 
market will continue to operate regardless of productivity levels.
Competitive markets and efficient trade require basic infrastructure 
roads, bridges, ports, and airports. Lower transport costs, as well as stream-
lined, cheaper border compliance processes, increase exports. Logistics 
infrastructure facilitates the online trading of nondigital products.
Broadband access is a prerequisite for business in the digital eraafter 
all, many firms depend in part or even exclusively on the Internet. Mobile 
phone access alone is not enough; broadband technologies push down 
transaction costs even further in remote markets that lack transport infra-
structure. Those living in the Middle East and North Africa region are some 
of the most underserved. Although that region can boast over 120 mobile 
phone subscriptions for every 100 inhabitants (one of the highest levels in 
the world), it has fewer than 10 broadband subscriptions per 100 inhabi-
tants, and bandwidth per subscriber is limited. In the end, this means that 
although the citizens of these countries are active on social media, digital 
finance has barely any presence.
Technology allows firms to sharpen their competitive edge by making 
their operations more efficient and by enabling them to create new ways of 
doing business. Teleroute, a Belgian platform, uses an algorithm to match 
freight forwarders and carriers in Europe, reducing empty runs by up to 
25 percent. Improved connectivity also enables start-ups to source essential 
technical expertise through online freelancing platforms. Upwork, a U.S. 

42    |    WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2019
platform, has since 2015 connected 5 million businesses with more than 
12 million freelancers. Its fourth-largest community of task providers is in 
Ukraine. At one time, start-ups required data centers, information tech-
nology systems, custom software, and a user support infrastructure to take 
on large conglomerates. In the digital age, entrepreneurs worldwide have 
access to these services via the Internet.
One aspect of the digital economy is that it poses new challenges for com-
petition law, mergers and acquisitions, and consumer welfare. The ascent of 
platform firms raises issues related to market power (figure 2.2). The net-
work effects associated with some online products often lead to significant 
benefits for early adopters, resulting in market concentration and facilitating 
the emergence of monopolies. In 2017 Safaricom, Kenya’s largest mobile 
phone operator, with 80 percent of the market, launched M-Pesa, the coun-
try’s first mobile money system. A year later, M-Pesa commanded the same 
market share in mobile money.
Platform firms at times exclude competitors by charging higher fees for 
other networks to interconnect. When Zimbabwe mandated interoperabil-
ity and infrastructure sharing among e-money operators, the number of 
subscribers rose by 15 percent. In Peru, the telecom regulator forced the 
largest communication networks to offer messaging services to banks that 
were expanding into e-money.
Overall, the digital economy poses challenges for policy makers. Many 
digital platform companies operate in adjacent, multisided markets, bun-
dling or at least connecting differ-
ent types of services. New types 
of market power emerge when 
firms provide services free of 
charge on one side of the market 
in exchange for user data and 
then they monetize that data on 
another side of the market. Anti-
trust investigations are having 
to adjust to these new situations 
and use new rules of analysis.
Tax avoidance
With the boundaries of firms 
transcending borders and phys-
ical assets, it has become easier 
to shift profits to low-tax juris-
dictions (tax planning and tax 
avoidance). As a result, billions 
of dollars of corporate profits go 
untaxed every year. The inter-
national tax system would ben-
efit from an update; how to tax

The changing nature of firms    |    43
businesses in the globalized digital economy and how to distribute value are 
questions under debate.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) 
estimates that US$100–$240 billion is lost in revenue each year from base 
erosion and profit shifting by multinational companies.15 This amount is 
equivalent to 4–10 percent of global corporate income tax revenue. Another 
estimate suggests that multinationals shift close to 40 percent of their profits 
to tax havens, resulting in a loss of 12 percent of global corporate tax reve-
nues.16 These losses are not equal across countries, however. Australia, Bra-
zil, France, India, Japan, Mexico, and the United States, as well as much of 
Africa, are among the countries estimated to be most hurt by profit shifting.17
A multitude of loopholes can be found in tax laws, many created through 
corporate lobbying, that enable companies to reduce their tax burden. These 
loopholes can be used by corporations to increase their tax deductions and 
move profits elsewhere, at times to jurisdictions with low or zero corporate 
income taxes—so-called tax havens or investment hubs. This phenomenon is 
neither new nor illegal, but it is easier in the digital economy. In 2016 almost 
60 percent of Fortune 500 companies had at least one affiliate established in 
Bermuda or the Cayman Islands, both of which have a 0 percent corporate 
income tax rate. The Paradise Papers, leaked in late 2017, are exposing many 
examples of tax avoidance and tax evasion worldwide.18
The problem is that the current rules are based on both source and resi-
dence. Source relates to a justification based on the geographic location of the 
income-generating activities (the idea of “where value is created” linked to 
the physical presence of labor or capital). Residence refers to where the com-
pany receiving the income is considered to have its primary location, usually 
based on where the company is incorporated or effectively managed as per 
the owner’s linkage to the state (residence, domicile, or citizenship—physical 
presence). Source countries have primary taxing rights over the income from 
sales. Residence countries tax multinationals’ income from cash investments. 
In practice, under the prevailing rules multinational enterprises pay taxes 
in the countries in which they locate their affiliates and activities. Firms 
organize their own internal cross-border production structures between 
affiliates, declaring different profits for different affiliates, in some cases 
seemingly irrespective of the direct value generation by each affiliate. It is 
often difficult to identify when these structures are legitimate and when they 
are established principally to avoid paying taxes in higher-tax jurisdictions. 
Because they have many opportunities to avoid paying taxes, it is not 
surprising that firms do so. In fact, profits have become more sensitive to 
international tax differentials over time, which means firms are getting bet-
ter at avoiding taxes. Some firms engage in transfer mispricing, charging 
lower prices for exports sold from high-tax countries to low-tax countries, 
or higher prices for inputs coming from low-tax countries. The strategic 
location of intellectual property ownership, international debt shifting 
through intracompany loans, treaty shopping, and tax deferrals are other 
mechanisms used to avoid taxes. Effective corporate taxation rates have a 
decisive impact on where affiliates locate. A 1 percentage point larger tax 

44    |    WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2019
rate differential between two jurisdictions reduces the reported pretax prof-
its of an affiliate by 1 percent.19 Tax treaties are estimated to have reduced 
tax revenues in Africa by about 8.5 percent among those countries that 
signed a treaty with an investment hub.20 
The digital economy poses new challenges. The virtual nature of digital 
businesses makes it even easier to locate activities in low-tax jurisdictions. 
The provision of goods and services from abroad without a physical presence 
in countries where consumers are located escapes the traditional corporate 
tax. Digital firms are able to generate profit out of intangible assets such as 
(foreign) user data. As a result, identifying where value is created is difficult.
In 2016 OECD released a template for collecting the value added tax from 
foreign suppliers of digital goods and services. Since then, more than 50 
countries have adopted the recommended guidelines for imposing the tax 
on the direct consumer sales of services and intangibles by foreign suppliers. 
More recently, in early 2018, the OECD Task Force on the Digital Economy 
(comprising over 110 countries and jurisdictions) released an interim report 
on tax challenges arising from digitization and has committed to delivering 
a long-term, consensus-based solution by 2020. 
The European Union has levied the value added tax on nonresident sup-
pliers of telecommunications, broadcasting, and electronic services, regard-
less of scale, since January 2015. Nonresident businesses are required to 
charge the customer the tax at the rate applying in the customer’s country, 
removing the competitive advantage held by digital companies located in 
countries with low value added tax rates. This new value added tax has 
raised more than €3 billion for the European Union. Australia adopted a 
similar approach in July 2017. Singapore announced in its February 2018 
budget that a goods and services tax will be imposed on imported services, 
including digital services such as music and movie streaming, starting in 
January 2020. Other advanced economies with indirect taxes on the digi-
tal economy are Japan, the Republic of Korea, New Zealand, Norway, the  
Russian Federation, and South Africa.
Less has been done in emerging economies, where the additional tax 
revenues are needed the most. In 2017 Serbia and Taiwan, China, adopted 
models extending their value added tax regimes to cover digital suppliers.  
In 2018 Argentina and Turkey did the same. China, Malaysia, and Thailand 
are among the countries reviewing their tax laws to extend collection to 
digital profits. 
As an alternative, a government could introduce a new freestanding tax 
on foreign suppliers of digital services. Such a tax would do a better job 
of directly targeting foreign suppliers rather than domestic consumers. It 
would avoid conflict with existing double taxation agreements by being 
separate from the mainstream income tax system. Arguably, a freestanding 
tax would level the playing field between domestic and foreign suppliers 
of digital services. As for the value added tax, collecting this kind of tax is 
enhanced through a registry of nonresident suppliers of digital services.
In 2016 the government of India introduced a 6 percent equalization 
levy on online advertising revenue paid by Indian companies to nonres-
ident e-commerce companies. In March 2018 the European Commission 

The changing nature of firms    |    45
proposed a tax on the gross revenues from digital activities in which users 
have a major role in value creation. The tax would apply to revenues from 
selling online advertising space, intermediary activities that allow users to 
interact and sell goods and services, and the sale of data. The Commission 
has estimated that a 3 percent tax could raise €5 billion a year. European 
Union members have yet to reach a consensus on whether to adopt the tax.
Along with the adoption of new measures to tax digital business, the 
international community has been taking steps to address base erosion 
and profit shifting, as well as other tax avoidance or evasion schemes, by 
both digital and traditional business. The Global Forum on Transparency 
and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes brings together almost 150 
­jurisdictions to implement internationally agreed standards on transpar-
ency and the exchange of information for tax purposes. In addition, the 
Base Erosion and Profit Shifting initiative launched by OECD and G-20 
countries in 2013 brings together more than 115 countries to reduce tax 
avoidance. The group negotiated a comprehensive package of measures 
to reduce profit shifting, placing more emphasis on the source principle. 
Emphasizing the source principle better aligns the location of taxable profits 
with the location of value creation and improves the information available 
to tax authorities.
In addition to these initiatives, other steps to strengthen tax adminis-
tration include widening the definition of a “permanent establishment” to 
recognize that companies may conduct considerable business in a country 
without having much of a physical presence; strengthening transfer pricing 
and anti–tax avoidance rules and audit capacity by emerging economies; 
adopting some aspects of formulary apportionment; and relying on targeted 
anti–tax avoidance measures such as stronger controlled foreign corporation 
rules.
Governments are taking some steps unilaterally. New anti-diversion rules 
entered into force in the United Kingdom in 2015, allowing firms to pay 
taxes up-front. The rules are designed to incentivize greater compliance 
with the mainstream corporate income tax regime. Australia adopted sim-
ilar rules in 2016. Meanwhile, these countries already have a transfer pric-
ing capacity and a sophisticated suite of anti–tax avoidance measures. The 
context for emerging economies is rather different, however. Their capac-
ity to address transfer pricing risks is low, so anti–tax avoidance legislation 
may not be effective. By integrating a more mechanical and targeted anti- 
diversion rule into their corporate tax systems, these countries could better 
tackle tax avoidance. Certain minimum criteria as set out in the law could 
trigger the application of such a rule. Some countries also impose a mini-
mum tax based on turnover.
Growing public discontent with tax avoidance practices by multinational 
firms has revived discussions around more significant overhauls of the inter-
national tax system. Global formulary apportionment is one option that 
has garnered much interest among some policy makers, although the chal-
lenges involved in reaching global agreement and implementation make it 
unlikely to be adopted. Such a system would divide the tax base between 
jurisdictions according to the location in which source activities take place. 

46    |    WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2019
Governments would have to agree on a formula to allocate profits, usually 
based on tangible assets such as volume of sales to third parties, assets, pay-
roll, or a head count of staff in each jurisdiction. This system is used domes-
tically in countries such as Canada and Switzerland to apportion income 
among provinces and cantons. Although global formulary apportionment 
would remove existing incentives for profit shifting to low-tax jurisdictions, 
it would create incentives for other methods of profit shifting.
Another option is a destination-based cash flow tax (or border-adjusted 
tax), which is similar to formulary apportionment based exclusively on vol-
ume of sales, but the tax base is not consolidated. Instead, governments tax 
net income from sales in the purchaser’s place of residence. 
The international community continues to take steps to mitigate weak-
nesses in global corporate tax. Important progress is being made in adjusting 
tax systems to the new nature of firms, particularly platform companies, but 
much more work remains to be done.

CHAPTER 3
Building human capital

T
he world is healthier and more educated than ever. In 1980 only 
5 in 10 primary school-age children in low-income countries were 
enrolled in school. By 2015 this number had increased to 8 in 10. In 
1980 only 84 of 100 children reached their fifth birthday, compared 
with 94 of 100 in 2018. A child born in the developing world in 1980 could 
expect to live for 52 years. In 2018 this number was 65 years. 
But a large and unfinished agenda remains. Life expectancy in the devel-
oping world still lags far behind that of rich countries such as the Republic 
of Korea, where a girl born in 2018 can expect to live more than 85 years. 
Nearly a quarter of children under age 5 are malnourished. In many places, 
the working memory and executive functions (such as sustained attention) 
of poor children begin to lag as early as at 6 months of age.1 Worldwide, 
more than 260 million children and youth are not in school. Meanwhile, 
nearly 60 percent of primary school children in developing countries fail to 
achieve minimum proficiency in learning.
Human capital consists of the knowledge, skills, and health that people 
accumulate over their lives, enabling them to realize their potential as pro-
ductive members of society. It has large payoffs for individuals, societies, and 
countries. This was true in the 1700s when the Scottish economist Adam 
Smith wrote, “The acquisition of . . . talents during . . . education, study or 
apprenticeship, costs a real expense, which [is] capital in [a] person. Those 
talents [are] part of his fortune [and] likewise that of society.”2 This is still 
true in 2018.
For individuals, an additional year of school generates higher earnings  
on average. These returns are large in low- and middle-income countries, 
especially for women. However, what children learn matters more than how 
long they stay in school. In the United States, replacing a low-quality teacher 
in an elementary school classroom with an average-quality teacher raises 
the combined lifetime income of that classroom’s students by US$250,000.3
Despite the larger supply of educated workers, returns to investments in 
education have increased since 2000.4 Returns to education are especially 
high when technology is changingpeople with higher human capital adapt 
faster to technological change. Indeed, a worker’s future success depends on 
working with machines, not fearing them. In Mexico, the benefits of increased 
labor productivity resulting from the 1994 North American Free Trade Agree-
ment (NAFTA) have been concentrated among more skilled workers. 
Developing sociobehavioral skills such as an aptitude for teamwork, 
empathy, conflict resolution, and relationship management enlarges a per-
son’s human capital. Globalized and automated economies put a higher pre-
mium on human capabilities that cannot be fully mimicked by machines. 
Abilities such as grit have economic returns that are often as large as those 
associated with cognitive skills.
Health is an important component of human capital. People are more 
productive when they are healthier. In Nigeria, a program providing malaria 
testing and treatment increased workers’ earnings by 10 percent in just a 
few weeks.5 A study in Kenya showed that deworming in childhood reduced 
school absences while raising wages in adulthood by as much as 20 percent, 
all thanks to a pill that costs 25 cents to produce and deliver.6
50   

Building human capital    |    51
From an early age, the dimensions of human capital complement each 
other. Proper nutrition in utero and in early childhood improves chil-
dren’s physical and mental well-being. Evidence from the United Kingdom 
revealed that schoolchildren who had healthier diets significantly increased 
their achievements in English and science.7 Meanwhile, a multicountry 
study in Southeast Asia found that both underweight and obese children 
had lower IQ scores than healthy-weight children.8 In India, giving pre-
schoolers mathematics-based games generated enduring improvements in 
their intuitive abilities.9
The benefits of human capital transcend private returns, extending to 
others and across generations.10 Deworming one child decreases the chances 
of other children becoming infected with worms, which in turn sets those 
children up for better learning and higher wages.11 Maternal education, 
through better prenatal care, improves infant health. In Pakistan, children 
whose mothers have even a single year of education spend an extra hour a 
day studying at home.12
These individual returns to human capital add up to large benefits for 
economies—countries become richer as more human capital accumulates. 
Human capital complements physical capital in the production process and 
is an important input to technological innovation and long-run growth. As 
a result, between 10 and 30 percent of per capita gross domestic product 
(GDP) differences is attributable to cross-country differences in human cap-
ital.13 This percentage could be even higher when considering the quality of 
education or the interactions between workers with different skills. And not 
to be overlooked, by generating higher incomes, human capital accelerates 
the demographic transition and reduces poverty.
Over the longer term, human capital matters for societies. In the mid-
1970s, Nigeria introduced universal primary education, sending a large 
cohort of children through primary school who otherwise would not 
have gone. Years later, the members of that cohort were found to be more 
engaged in political life. They paid closer attention to the news, spoke to 
their peers about politics, attended community meetings, and voted more 
often than those who did not go to primary school. Young participants in 
the National Volunteer Service Program in Lebanon, an intercommunity 
soft skills training program, display higher levels of overall tolerance. As the 
scientist Marie Curie once said, “You cannot hope to build a better world 
without improving the individuals.”
Human capital also fosters social capital. Surveys typically find that more 
educated people are more trusting of others. Research suggests that the large 
wave of compulsory school reforms that took place across Europe in the 
mid-20th century made people more tolerant of immigrants than they were 
before.14 Social capital in turn is associated with higher economic growth.15 
Conversely, failing to protect human capital undermines social cohesion. 
Human capital is one of the first things to suffer when things fall apart. 
Wars often prevent whole generations from realizing their potential. For 
example, between 2011 and 2017 almost 4 million Syrian children left 
school because of the civil war. Many of them are likely to never make up 
for these lost years of school (figure 3.1).

52    |    WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2019
Why governments 
should get involved
Individuals and families often 
cannot afford the costs of acquir-
ing human capital. Even when 
human capital investments are 
affordable, individual decisions 
may be shaped by lack of infor-
mation, or restricted because of 
the prevalent social norms. Indi-
viduals also do not necessarily 
consider the wider social bene-
fits for others. For these reasons, 
governments have an important 
role to play in fostering human 
capital acquisition.
Many disadvantaged families 
want to invest in better health 
and education for their children 
but cannot afford to do so. The 
proof is how families spend their 
money once budget constraints 
are even slightly relaxed. In 
Sierra Leone, only three to four 
months after the introduction 
of a public works program that 
increased income, participating families significantly increased their spend-
ing on health services, especially for children.16
Even when education is free, the cost of transportation and school sup-
plies, together with the earnings lost while a child is in school instead of 
working, make education prohibitively expensive. Many poor rural families 
cannot afford the time it takes to travel to the nearest school or medical 
facility. In Niger, only 24 percent of the population lives within a one-hour 
walk of the nearest medical facility during the wet season.17
In cases such as these, government interventions make a big difference. 
Cash transfer programs have improved the health and education of mil-
lions of children in low- and middle-income countries, even when they 
have provided only partial subsidies for the cost of school. Shombhob, a 
conditional cash transfer program piloted in Bangladesh, reduced wasting 
among children ages 10–22 months and taught mothers about the benefits 
of breastfeeding.18 And the effects of these programs are felt over time. A 
two-year conditional cash transfer program in Malawi targeting adolescent 
girls and young women produced a large increase in educational attain-
ment and a sustained reduction in the total number of births in girls who 
were out of school at the start of the program. These benefits persisted after 
the program ended.19

Note: The number of children out of school between 2011 and 
2017 is based on estimates of actual declines in school enroll-
ment relative to prewar trends and on the assumed impact war 
has had on student enrollment. The scenario from 2018 onward 
explores the long-term consequences of these trends by assum-
ing that school enrollments gradually return to prewar trends 
and corrects for the population dynamics of refugee in-and-out 
flow rates (if they are similar to those after past international 
conflicts). Similar assumptions are also made for internally dis-
placed persons but with higher return rates during the first few 
years after the end of the war.

Building human capital    |    53
Programs can improve people’s incentives to invest in human capital 
when they make its long-term benefits salient or provide mechanisms to 
make good choices binding. Young people may not want to stay in school 
or take care of their health because they lack self-control or do not fully 
appreciate the benefits of education and good health.20 However, when they 
receive information about human capital it has big effects on their behav-
ior. In the Philippines, young people were offered a voluntary commitment 
program in which money they had placed in a savings account was returned 
to them only if they passed a smoking cessation test. The program saw a 
significant reduction in smoking.21
Human capital investment generates significant social returns as well, 
but these are often hard for parents to quantify, let alone factor into their 
decisions. When deciding to deworm their children, parents may not con-
sider the fact that other children are also less likely to be infected. Parents 
deciding to send their children to preschool may not consider the wider 
future societal benefits such as lower crime and incarceration rates that have 
been associated with early childhood development programs. A 2010 study 
of Perry Preschool, a high-quality program for 3- to 5-year-olds developed 
in the 1960s in Michigan in the United States, estimated a return to soci-
ety over and above the private return of about US$7–$12 for each dollar 
invested.22 Without government interventions, families might not choose to 
invest enough in these types of programs.
Ensuring access to a quality education closes early gaps in cognitive and 
sociobehavioral skills. By the age of 3, children from low-income fami-
lies have heard 30 million fewer words than their more affluent peers. 
As children turn into teenagers, interventions to close these gaps become 
more expensive. Evidence suggests that, for governments seeking to invest 
wisely in human capital, there is no better possibility than investing in  
the first thousand days of a child’s life. Without such interventions early 
in life, it is more likely that a spiral of increasing inequality will ensue: 
subsequent public investments in education and health are more likely to 
benefit people who start out better off.
Government actions to support investment in human capital go well 
beyond spending on health, education, and social protection programs. In 
Nepal, investments in sanitation are contributing significantly to preventing 
anemia.23 Housing programs improve the education and labor market out-
comes of the most disadvantaged by changing the quality of the peers with 
whom they interact. The earlier children are exposed to better-off neigh-
bors, the stronger are the effects. 
Why measurement helps
Governments have a vital role to play in building human capital: as provid-
ers of health, education, and financing to ensure equitable access to oppor-
tunities and as regulators of accreditation and quality control of private 
providers. And yet they often fail to deliver. Most governments commit a 
significant share of their budgets to education and health, but public services 

54    |    WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2019
are often too low quality to generate human capital. Sometimes, those ser-
vices fail only the poor. Sometimes, they fail everyone—and the rich simply 
opt out of the public system.
Shortfalls in quality persist for two reasons. First, pursuing good poli-
cies does not always pay off politically. Second, bureaucracies may lack the 
capacity or incentives to convert good policies into effective programs. If 
public health is not politically relevant until there is a health crisis, politi-
cians have little reason to prepare for future pandemics. Even when poli-
ticians and voters agree on the importance of an issue, they may disagree 
about the solution. Rarely is it popular to fund public health programs by 
raising taxes or by diverting money from more visible expenditures, such as 
on infrastructure or public subsidies. 
The government of Nigeria encountered resistance in 2012 when it tried 
to repeal fuel subsidies to spend more on maternal and child health services. 
The media focused on the unpopular subsidy repeal and paid scant attention 
to the much-needed expansion of primary health care. The subsidy was thus 
reinstated because of public protests. Such a response to proposed changes 
occurs in some countries because the organized interests that stand to lose 
from reforms are powerful. In others, it happens because of a weak social 
contract: citizens do not trust their government, and so they are hesitant to 
pay taxes that they worry will be misspent. The consequence is that gov-
ernments favor spending more on the politically visible aspects of human 
capital such as constructing schools and hospitals but much less on intan-
gible aspects—such as the quality and competence of teachers and health 
workers. Campaigning politicians often promise new schools or hospitals, 
but rarely do they discuss actual learning levels or stunting rates.
Because investments in human capital may not produce economic 
returns for years, politicians tend to think of shorter-term ways to burnish 
their reputations. Although people with a basic education earn more than 
people with no education, labor market returns for a basic education are 
not realized until 10–15 years after these investments are made. This is even 
truer of investments in early childhood education. In Jamaica, providing 
toddlers with psychosocial stimulation increased earnings by 25 percent, but 
these returns only materialized 20 years later.24
One illustration of how technical and political complexities get in the 
way of delivering human capital interventions is in the area of early child-
hood development. Scholars generally agree that investments in children 
have high rates of return. However, challenges make the large-scale imple-
mentation of such investments difficult. First, as just noted, it takes a long 
time for society to benefit from these investments. Second, services have 
to be delivered in a synergic way over a short period within a person’s life 
cycle. Third, multiple government departments are involved in the delivery 
of early childhood investments. Still, the experiences of countries such as 
Brazil, Chile, and Colombia reveal that large-scale early childhood develop-
ment policies are feasible. One program, Chile Crece Contigo (Chile Grows 
with You), launched in 2006, serves as a reference point for middle-income 

Building human capital    |    55
countries willing to invest in children on a large scale. The Chilean early 
childhood development program integrates health, education, and social 
protection services for young children, combining universal and targeted 
programs. Rigorous evaluations boost the demand for political commitment.
Bureaucracies charged with implementing policies to build human capi-
tal often lack the capacity or the incentives to do so effectively. The World 
Bank’s Service Delivery Indicators surveys conducted in seven countries in 
Sub-Saharan Africa (together representing close to 40 percent of the con-
tinent’s population) found that, on average, 3 in 10 fourth-grade teachers 
had not mastered the language curriculum they were teaching. On a posi-
tive note, 94 percent of Kenyan teachers had done so. The surveys paint an 
equally mixed picture for health care facilities: about 80 percent of Kenyan 
doctors could correctly diagnose a basic condition such as neonatal asphyxia, 
whereas less than 50 percent of Nigerian doctors were able to do so. 
Better measurement of outcomes sheds light on the political and bureau-
cratic failures that lead to the poor-quality delivery of social services. Infor-
mation is an essential first step toward encouraging citizens to demand more 
from their leaders and service providers. In Uganda, releasing report cards 
on the performance of local health facilities galvanized communities to press 
for service delivery reforms. This pressure led in turn to sustained improve-
ments in health outcomes, including a reduction in mortality for children 
under 5.
Better measurement also increases policy makers’ awareness of the 
importance of investing in human capital, thereby creating momentum 
for action. Twaweza, a Tanzanian organization, launched a survey to assess 
children’s basic literacy and numeracy. The dismal results—released in 
2011—showed that only 3 in 10 third-grade students had mastered second- 
grade numeracy, and even fewer could read a second-grade story. The 
World Bank’s own Service Delivery Indicators, released around the same 
time, shone a spotlight on the low levels of teacher competence and high 
levels of absenteeism in Tanzania. Together, these results led to a loud pub-
lic outcry and the introduction of Tanzania’s Big Results Now initiative, a 
government effort to track and address low levels of learning. It is already 
leading to tangible results.
More information is also needed to design and deliver cost-effective pol-
icies, even when a government is fully willing to invest in human capital. 
Both Peru and Vietnam have implemented ambitious policies to improve 
human capital. But only a comprehensive measurement of the factors that 
contribute to individual learning will shed light on the reasons behind dif-
ferentials between these two countries. Once the gaps have been identified, 
cost-effective policies have to be designed and brought to scale. 
The human capital project
Credible measurement of education and health outcomes raises the impor-
tance of human capital locally, nationally, and globally. Measurement spurs 
the demand for policy interventions to build human capital in countries 

56    |    WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2019
where governments are not doing enough. Good measurement is essential 
to developing research and analysis to inform the design of policies that 
improve human capital.
With this goal in mind, the World Bank has launched the human capital 
project—a program of advocacy, measurement, and analytical work to raise 
awareness and increase demand for interventions to build human capital. 
The project has three components: (1) a cross-country metric—the human 
capital index, (2) a program of measurement and research to inform policy 
action, and (3) a program of support for country strategies to accelerate 
investment in human capital.
The first step in the project is an international metric to benchmark 
certain components of human capital across countries.25 The new index 
measures the amount of human capital that a child born in 2018 can expect 
to attain by age 18 in view of the risks of poor education and poor health 
that prevail in the country in which she was born. The index is designed to 
highlight how improvements in the current education and health outcomes 
shape the productivity of the next generation of workers: it assumes that 
children born in a given year experience current educational opportunities 
and health risks over the next 18 years. A focus on outcomes—and not 
inputs such as spending or regulation—directs attention to results, which 
are what really matter. It also makes the human capital index relevant to 
the policy makers who design and implement interventions to improve 
these outcomes in the medium term.
The index follows the trajectory from birth to adulthood of a child born 
in a given year. In the poorest countries, there is a significant risk that the 
child does not even survive to see her fifth birthday. Even if she does reach 
school age, there is a further risk that she does not start school, let alone 
complete the full cycle of education through grade 12 that is the norm in 
rich countries. The time she does spend in school may translate unevenly 
into learning, depending on the quality of her teachers and schools and the 
support she receives from her family. After she reaches her 18th year, she 
carries with her the lasting childhood effects of poor health and nutrition 
that limit her physical and cognitive abilities as an adult.
The human capital index quantifies the milestones in this trajectory in 
terms of their consequences for the productivity of the next generation of 
workers. It has three components: (1) a measure of whether children sur-
vive from birth to school age (age 5); (2) a measure of expected years of 
quality-adjusted school, which combines information on the quantity and 
quality of education (figure 3.2, panel a); and (3) two broad measures of 
health—stunting rates (figure 3.2, panel b) and adult survival rates.
Survival to age 5 is measured using under-5 mortality rates compiled 
by the United Nations Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation. 
Nearly all children survive from birth to school age in rich countries. But 
in the poorest countries, as many as 1 in 10 children do not see their fifth 
birthday. The deaths of these children are not just a tragedy, but also a loss of 
their human capital, which never is realized.

Building human capital    |    57
The quantity of education is measured as the number of years of school a 
child can expect to obtain by her 18th birthday, given the prevailing pattern 
of enrollment rates across grades, and assuming she starts preschool at age 4. 
The best possible outcome occurs when children stay in school for 14 years, 
through age 18. High enrollment rates throughout the school system bring 
many rich countries close to the 14-year benchmark. But in the poorest 
countries, children can expect to complete only half of that.
The World Bank Group and its partners are developing a comprehen-
sive new database of international student achievement test scores covering 
around 160 economies to benchmark what children learn. The database 
harmonizes results from international and regional testing programs so they

are comparable. For the first time, learning is measurable in nearly all coun-
tries using the same yardstick. 
The differences in learning are dramatic. Country-level average test 
scores range from around 600 in the best-performing countries to around 
300 in the worst-performing. To put these numbers in perspective, a score of 
roughly 400 corresponds to a benchmark of minimum proficiency set by the 
Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), the largest inter-
national testing program. Less than half of students in developing countries 
meet this standard, compared with 86 percent in advanced economies. In 
Singapore, 98 percent of students reach the international benchmark for 
basic proficiency in secondary school; in South Africa, only 26 percent of 
students meet that standard. Essentially, then, all of Singapore’s secondary 
school students are prepared for a postsecondary education and the world of 
work, while almost three-quarters of South Africa’s young people are not.
For health, there is no single directly measured and widely available indi-
cator comparable to years of school as a measure of educational attainment. 
In the absence of such a measure, two proxies for the overall health envi-
ronment make up this component of the index: adult survival rates and the 
rate of stunting for children under age 5. Adult survival rates are used as a 
proxy for the range of nonfatal health outcomes that a child born in a given 
year is likely to experience as an adult if current conditions prevail into the 
future. Stunting measures the share of children who are unusually small for 
their age. It is broadly accepted as a proxy for the prenatal, infant, and early 
childhood health environment, and it summarizes the risks to good health 
that children are likely to experience in their early years—with important 
consequences for health and well-being in adulthood.
The education and health components of human capital just described 
have an intrinsic value that is undeniably important—but also undeniably 
difficult to quantify. It is therefore challenging to combine the components 
into a single index that meaningfully reflects their contributions to human 
capital. Many existing indexes of human capital and human development 
resort to arbitrary aggregation of their components. By contrast, the com-
ponents of the human capital index are aggregated by first transforming 
them into measures of their respective contributions to worker productiv-
ity relative to a benchmark corresponding to a complete education and full 
health. This approach follows the development accounting literature.26 The 
size of the contributions of education and health to worker productivity 
is anchored in the extensive microeconometric literature on estimating 
returns to education and health.
Because the human capital index is measured in terms of the productivity 
of the next generation of workers relative to the benchmark of complete 
education and full health, the units of the index have a natural interpre-
tation: a value of x for a country means that the productivity as a future 
worker of a child born in a given year in that country is only a fraction x of 
what it could be under the benchmark (table 3.1). This future productivity is 
divisible into the contributions of the three components of the index, each of 

Building human capital    |    59
which is also expressed in terms of productivity relative to the benchmark. 
The three components are then multiplied to arrive at the overall index. 
Differences in human capital have large implications for the productivity 
of the next generation of workers. In a country at around the 25th percentile 
of the distribution of each of the components, a child born in 2018 will be 
only 43 percent as productive as that child would be under the benchmark 
of complete education and full health.
The index, because of its units, can be connected in a straightforward 
fashion to scenarios for future per capita income and growth. Imagine a sta-
tus quo scenario in which the expected years of quality-adjusted school and 
level of health, as measured in the index for a given year, persist into the 
future. Over time, new entrants to the workforce with status quo education 
and health replace current members of the workforce, until eventually the 
entire workforce of the future has the expected years of quality-adjusted 
school and level of health captured in the current human capital index. It is 
possible to then compare this scenario with one in which the entire future 
workforce benefits from a complete education and enjoys full health.
In the long run, per capita GDP in this scenario is higher than in the sta-
tus quo scenario through two channels: the direct effects of higher worker

Note: “Contribution to productivity” measures how much each component of the index, as well as the overall index, con-
tributes to the expected future productivity as a worker of a child born in 2018 relative to the benchmark of a complete 
education and full health. A value of x means that productivity is only a fraction x of what it would be under the benchmark 
of a complete education and full health. Estimates of productivity contributions are anchored in microeconometric evi-
dence on the returns to education and health. “Quality-adjusted years of school” equals the country’s test score relative 
to the global best test score multiplied by the country’s expected years of school.

productivity and the indirect effects that reflect the greater investments in 
physical capital that are induced by having more productive workers. Com-
bining these effects, a country with an index score of x will in the long run 
have per capita GDP in the status quo scenario that is only a fraction x of 
what it could be with a complete education and full health. For example, 
a country with an index of x = 0.5 would in the long run have per capita 
incomes twice as high as the status quo if its citizens enjoyed a complete 
education and full health. What this means in terms of average annual 
growth rates depends on the time period. If 50 years—or about two gener-
ations—are required for these scenarios to materialize, then a doubling of 
future per capita income relative to the status quo corresponds to roughly 
1.4 percentage points of additional growth per year.
The index measures the amount of human capital that the average child 
born in 2018 expects to achieve (figure 3.3). However, averages hide a great 
deal of variation. Most of the components of the index can be disaggregated 
by gender for most countries so that differences in the prospects of boys 
versus girls can be observed. Although it is not possible to do so systemat-
ically for a large set of countries, in individual countries in which the data 
are richer, differences in the components of the index across regions and 
socioeconomic groups can also be illustrated.
The human capital index presented in table 3.2 is the first edition. Like 
all cross-country benchmarking exercises, it has limitations, with scope for 
improvement and expansion in subsequent versions. Components of the 
index such as stunting and test scores are measured only infrequently in 
some countries and not at all in others. Data on test scores are retrieved 
from international testing programs in which the age of the test takers and 
the subjects covered vary. Test scores may not accurately reflect the quality 
of the entire education system of a country to the extent that test takers 
are not representative of the population of all students. Reliable measures 
of the quality of tertiary education do not yet exist, despite the importance 
of higher education for human capital in a rapidly changing world. Data 
on enrollment rates, needed to estimate expected school years, often have 
many gaps and are reported with significant lags. Sociobehavioral skills are 
not explicitly captured. Adult survival rates are imprecisely estimated in 
countries where vital registries are incomplete or nonexistent.
One objective of the human capital index is to call attention to these 
data shortcomings and to galvanize action to remedy them. Improving 
data takes time. In the interim, and recognizing these limitations, country 
scores on the index should be interpreted with caution. While providing 
estimates of how current education and health shape the productivity of 
future workers, the index is not a finely graduated measurement of small 
differences between countries. Because it captures outcomes, it is not a 
checklist of policy actions. The type and scale of interventions required  
to build human capital are not the same from country to country.
Although there has been significant improvement in the availability 
of data on education and health outcomes, there is still a long way to go. 
For example, advanced cognitive and sociobehavioral skills, which are not

Note: The human capital index ranges between 0 and 1. The index is measured in terms of the productivity of the next generation of workers relative to the 
benchmark of complete education and full health. An economy in which the average worker achieves both full health and full education potential will score a 
value of 1 on the index. GDP = gross domestic product; PPP = purchasing power parity.

Note: The human capital index ranges between 0 and 1. The index is measured in terms of the productivity of the next generation of workers relative to the 
benchmark of complete education and full health. An economy in which the average worker achieves both full health and full education potential will score a 
value of 1 on the index.

incorporated in the index, are important contributors to individual produc-
tivity. And comparable data are lacking on early childhood development, 
which is a significant foundation for the quality of the future labor force.  
Yet another task is measuring the intermediate factors that affect these 
outcomes. Although citizens of low- and middle-income countries face 
similar constraints in the accumulation of human capital, the relevance of 
these constraints is often context-specific. Understanding which constraints 
matter the most is essential to setting priorities across policy areas.
A first step is improving the quality of basic administrative data in 
education and health. Only one in six governments publish annual edu-
cation monitoring reports. Just 100 countries or so report reasonably 
complete and up-to-date data on net enrollment rates at different levels 
of education to the UNESCO Institute for Statistics—the body tasked with 
compiling this data internationally. Monitoring of even the most basic 
health information—births and deaths—is insufficient in low- and middle- 
income countries (figure 3.4). The pace of improvement in these systems 
has been slow. Worldwide, between 2000 and 2012 the percentage of reg-
istered deaths changed from only 36 percent to 38 percent. The percentage 
of children under 5 whose births were registered only increased from 58 
percent to 65 percent.27 High-quality basic administrative data are essential 
for governments to understand 
their needs and to plan the allo-
cation of public services.
Increasing the number of 
countries in which the learn-
ing achievements of children 
are measured—both those in 
and out of school—would allow 
much better tracking of coun-
tries’ performance for school 
access and learning. This should 
include making data on learn-
ing fully representative of all 
children rather than the selec-
tion—often from higher-income 
families—of those who stay in 
school. The Annual Status of Edu-
cation Report is a rare example of 
a survey that provides an annual 
assessment of the learning levels 
of children—in this case from 
India’s 
rural 
households—of 
those who are also out of school.
Initiatives that create compa-
rable measures of learning across 
countries would be a remedy.

They would seek to bring together stakeholders to agree on a set of common 
questions to include in learning assessments, thereby allowing results to be 
harmonized across tests. In the short term, the existing data platforms—
national household surveys, Demographic and Health Surveys, Living 
Standards Measurement Study, and Service Delivery Indicators—could be 
used to increase the availability of data on human capital outcomes in a 
cost-effective way.
Similar efforts are under way in health. To improve the coordination of 
health data collection, the Health Data Collaborative was launched in 2015 
by a group of international agencies, bilateral and multilateral donors, foun-
dations, and governments. New technologies such as the global positioning 
system and mobile phones are driving down costs of data collection. The 
Primary Health Care Performance Initiative, launched by the Bill & Melinda 
Gates Foundation, World Bank Group, and World Health Organization in 
2015, provides an  international benchmarking of primary care quality.
A second step is to better understand the many dimensions of socio­
behavioral and other skills, health, and the correlation between the two. 
Sociobehavioral skills are multidimensional. Initiatives such as the World 
Bank’s Skills Towards Employability and Productivity surveys and the 
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s Programme for 
the International Assessment of Adult Competencies surveys have sought to 
measure these skills on a large scale among working-age individuals. There 
has not been a similar attempt among school-age children, even though 
there is evidence that abilities such as grit and ­self-regulation matter for 
learning. Interventions that have reduced iron deficiency anemia have been 
found to improve student learning outcomes, but the correlation between 
health status and student test scores has not yet been quantified. The intro-
duction of health modules in school surveys would be an important first 
step. Relatively low-cost assessments, such as those of student vision acuity 
and anthropometric status, can go a long way toward improving under-
standing of the relationship between learning and health.    
Vietnam’s experience illustrates the potential benefits of mapping path-
ways of change. The country’s schoolchildren scored in the top quarter of 
the mostly middle- and high-income countries that participated in the 2012 
and 2015 PISA. This performance is remarkable in view of Vietnam’s level 
of per capita income. Understanding this success could provide important 
lessons for how to ensure that schooling achieves learning.
As the nature of work changes, human capital becomes more import-
ant. Yet significant gaps in human capital persist across the world. These 
gapsmanifested in low education and health outcomeshurt the future 
productivity of workers and future competitiveness of economies. To address 
this issue, governments must seek remedies. However, because of the long 
time needed for human capital investments to yield economic returns, the 
political incentives for human capital investments are often missing. The 
human capital project aims to create not just these incentives, but also the 
policy guidance for more and better investments in human capital.

CHAPTER 4
Lifelong learning

N
elson Mandela, the first president of postapartheid South Africa, 
once said, “Education is the great engine of personal development. 
It is through education that the daughter of a peasant can become 
a doctor, that the son of a mineworker can become the head of the 
mine, that the child of a farmworker can become the president of a great 
nation. It is what we make out of what we have, not what we are given, that 
separates one person from another.” 
Automation is reshaping work and the skills demanded for work. The 
demand for advanced cognitive skills1 and sociobehavioral skills2 is increasing, 
whereas the demand for narrow job-specific skills is waning.3 Meanwhile, the 
skills associated with “adaptability” are increasingly in demand. This combi-
nation of specific cognitive skills (critical thinking and problem-solving) and 
sociobehavioral skills (creativity and curiosity) is transferable across jobs.
How well countries cope with the demand for changing job skills depends 
on how quickly the supply of skills shifts. Education systems, however, tend 
to resist change. A significant part of the readjustment in the supply of 
skills is happening outside of compulsory education and formal jobs. Early 
childhood learning, tertiary education, and adult learning sought outside 
the workplace are increasingly important in meeting the skills that will be 
sought by future labor markets. This chapter shows how.
Automation—and the adoption of technology more generally—makes 
some jobs obsolete. The demand for skills linked to home appliance repair, 
for example, is shrinking quickly because technology is driving down the 
price of appliances and improving reliability. At the same time, innovation 
is creating new types of jobs. In fact, a large share of children entering pri-
mary school in 2018 will work in occupations that do not yet exist. Even 
in low- and middle-income countries, many people are employed in jobs 
that did not exist three decades ago. India has nearly 4 million app develop-
ers; Uganda has over 400,000 internationally certified organic farmers; and 
China has 100,000 data labelers. 
Meanwhile, many current jobs are being retooled into new forms, result-
ing in new and sometimes unexpected skill combinations. In 2018 a market-
ing professional might well be asked to write algorithms. A physics graduate 
may land a job as a quantitative trader in the finance industry. Workers 
who bring emerging skills into relevant technical fields of expertise—such 
as teachers who are good at web design and actuaries who are proficient in 
big data analytics—are likely to be in high demand.
Which skills are in less demand in 2018? Evidence from developed coun-
tries points to job polarization—the expansion of high- and low-skill jobs 
coupled with the decline of middle-skill jobs. The demand for workers who 
can undertake nonroutine cognitive tasks, such as high-skilled research, 
is increasing. So is the relative demand for workers able to handle non-
routine tasks that cannot be automated easily, such as food preparation. 
Conversely, the demand for workers for procedural routine tasks, which are 
often performed in middle-skill jobs such as data entry, is declining because 
of automation.

Lifelong learning    |    71
Is the same pattern beginning to emerge in low- and middle-income 
countries? Not quite. In many developing countries, the demand for high-
skill workers is increasing (figure 4.1). The share of workers in high-skill 
occupations increased by 8 percentage points or more in Bolivia, Ethiopia, 
and South Africa from 2000 to 2014. But the change in demand for low- 
and middle-skill jobs is more heterogeneous across countries. In Jordan, 
the share of employment in middle-skill jobs increased by 7.5 percentage 
points between 2000 and 2016. In Bangladesh, this share fell by almost  
20 percentage points during the same period.4
This change in the demand for workers for low- and middle-skill jobs 
in developing countries is not surprising. What happens at this end of the 
skills spectrum is likely to be driven by the competing forces of automation 
and globalization. The rate of technology adoption tends to vary consider-
ably across developing countries. In Europe and Central Asia, 26 percent 
of the population had fixed broadband subscriptions in 2016, compared 
with just 2 percent in South Asia. Globalization is bringing the low- and 
medium-skill jobs of developed countries to some—but not all—developing 
countries. Depending on the relative speed of these forces, some developing

Note: High-skill occupations: managers, professionals, technicians, and associate professionals. Middle-skill occupations: 
clerical support workers; sales and services workers; craft and related trades workers; skilled agricultural, forestry, and 
fishery workers; plant and machine operators and assemblers. Low-skill occupations: elementary occupations such as 
cleaners and helpers; laborers in agriculture, forestry, and fisheries; laborers in mining, construction, manufacturing, and 
transport; food preparation assistants; street and related sales and services workers.

countries are seeing an increase in middle-skill jobs; others are seeing a 
decline. 
Creating a skilled workforce for the future of work rests on the growing 
demand for advanced cognitive skills, sociobehavioral skills, and adaptabil-
ity. Evidence across low- to high-income countries suggests that in recent 
decades jobs are being defined by more cognitive, analytical tasks. In Bolivia 
and Kenya, more than 40 percent of workers using computers perform com-
plex tasks that require advanced programming. Indeed, the demand is grow-
ing for transferable higher-order cognitive skills such as logic, critical think-
ing, complex problem-solving, and reasoning. In all regions of the world, 
these skills are consistently ranked among those most valued by employers.  
Analysis of the job markets in Denmark, France, Germany, the Slovak 
Republic, South Africa, Spain, and Switzerland reveals that a one standard 
deviation increase in complex problem-solving skills is associated with a 
10–20 percent higher wage.5 In Armenia and Georgia, the ability to solve 
problems and learn new skills yields a wage premium of nearly 20 percent.6
The demand for sociobehavioral skills is also increasing in developing 
countries. In Latin America and the Caribbean, the adoption of digital tech-
nology has placed more importance on general cognitive skills and raised 
the demand for workers with interpersonal skills. In Cambodia, El Salvador, 
Honduras, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Malaysia, the Philippines, 
and Vietnam, more than half of firms report shortages of workers with spe-
cific sociobehavioral skills, such as commitment to work.7
Technological change makes it harder to anticipate which job-specific 
skills will thrive and which will become obsolete in the near future. In the 
past, shifts in skill requirements prompted by technological progress took 
centuries to manifest themselves (figure 4.2). In the digital era, advances in 
technology call for new skills seemingly overnight. 
The ability to adapt quickly to changes is increasingly valued by the 
labor market. The sought-after trait is adaptability—the ability to respond 
to unexpected circumstances and to unlearn and relearn quickly. This trait 
requires a combination of certain cognitive skills (critical thinking, problem- 
solving) and sociobehavioral skills (curiosity, creativity). A study of technical 
and vocational students in Nigeria showed that the sociobehavioral skill of 
self-efficacy was positively and significantly predictive of career adaptability.8
Strong skill foundations are important for developing advanced cognitive 
skills, sociobehavioral skills, and skills predictive of adaptability. For most 
children, these skill foundations are formed through primary and secondary 
education. Yet, according to the World Development Report 2018, the acquisi-
tion of foundational skills that one would expect to happen in schools is not 
occurring in many low- and middle-income countries.9
Important skills readjustments are happening increasingly outside of 
compulsory education and formal jobs. Skills development for the chang-
ing nature of work is a matter of lifelong learning. This kind of learning is 
especially germane to skills readjustment amid demographic change—be it 
the aging populations of East Asia and Eastern Europe or the large youth 
populations of Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.

Learning in early childhood
In France, the mandatory school starting age will soon be lowered from 6 to 
3 years. According to President Emmanuel Macron, this reform is intended 
to boost equality, thereby improving the ability of children from disadvan-
taged backgrounds to remain competitive in the education system.
The most effective way to acquire the skills demanded by the changing 
nature of work is to start early. Early investments in nutrition, health, social 
protection, and education lay strong foundations for the future acquisition of 
cognitive and sociobehavioral skills. They also make future skills acquisition 
more resilient to uncertainty. Early childhood investments are an import-
ant way to improve equality of opportunity. Currently, these investments 
are underprovided, especially for poor, disadvantaged children, who would 
benefit from them the most. Prioritizing these investments could pay off sig-
nificantly for economies, as long as both access and quality are highlighted.
The architecture of the brain forms from the prenatal period to age 5, and 
so this is an important stage for developing cognitive and sociobehavioral 
skills. During this period, the brain’s ability to learn from experience is at 
its highest level (figure 4.3). Experiences and learning during this period 
directly affect achievement in adulthood. If this window is missed, building 
skills becomes harder.
Quality early childhood development programs enable children to learn. 
Investments in nutrition, health, and stimulation in the first thousand days 
of life build stronger brains. The engagement of parents and caregivers 
during this phase also matters for the development of children’s language

skills, motor and self-regulation skills, as well as social behavior. In Colom-
bia, exposure to psychological stimulations through home visits with play 
demonstrations significantly improved the cognitive development of chil-
dren ages 12–24 months.10 In Pakistan, the efforts of the Lady Health Worker 
Programme, which provides health services in rural areas, led to children 
under 3 years old being more likely to be fully immunized in 2008 than 
in 2000 by 15 percentage points.11 The program has generated sustained 
positive effects on children’s cognitive abilities and pro-social behaviors by 
providing nutrition supplementation and encouraging mothers to engage in 
responsive play with children up to age 2.
From the age of 3, socialization and more formal early learning become 
important to prepare children to succeed in primary school. A quality pre-
school strengthens children’s executive functions (such as working memory, 
flexible thinking, self-control), launching them on higher learning trajecto-
ries. In Bangladesh, rural children who attended preschool performed better 
in early-grade speaking, writing, and mathematics, compared with those 
who did not.12 A preschool reform in rural Mozambique had positive effects 
on sociobehavioral development—participating children were better at 
interacting with others, following directions, and regulating their emotions 
under stress.13 However, to achieve these results preschools have to meet 
quality thresholds. In some cases, a low-quality preschool is worse for child 
development than no preschool at all.14
Poor-quality early childhood development programs are associated with 
disappointing results in children’s language development, cognitive skills,

that, despite high participation rates, the curriculum and pedagogical

approach were not age-appropriate. In the program, 3- to 6-year-olds had 
to follow academic-oriented instruction and even sit for exams.15 In Peru, 
although the national Wawa Wasi program has provided safe community- 
based daycare and a nutritious diet for children from ages 4 to 6 in impov-
erished areas, it has failed to improve children’s language or motor develop-
ment skills because of insufficiently trained caregivers. 
Early childhood investments efficiently produce skills that are relevant to 
a child’s future. Learning is cumulative—skills acquired at an earlier stage 
facilitate skills formation in subsequent stages. The returns to early invest-
ments are the highest of those made over the life span, and the advan-
tages conferred by these investments grow over time. An additional dollar 
invested in quality early childhood programs yields a return of US$6–$17.16 
Early childhood development programs improve parents’ labor force 
participation. Many women do not work because of time-consuming child- 
rearing responsibilities. In the United Kingdom, half of stay-at-home moth-
ers would prefer to go back to work if they had access to high-quality, afford-
able child care services. Early investments in such services would alleviate 
this constraint. In Argentina, a large-scale construction program of pre- 
primary school facilities in the 1990s positively affected maternal employ-
ment. In Spain, during the same period, maternal employment increased by 
10 percent because of the availability of full-time public care for 3-year-olds.17 
Early childhood investments also increase equity. For children exposed 
to poverty and other adverse conditions, quality early childhood programs 
increase adult competence, reduce violent behavior and social inhibition, 
and foster growth in the subsequent generation. In Guatemala, an early 
childhood development nutrition program for poor families significantly 
increased the wages for these children in adulthood.18 In Jamaica, early stim-
ulation for infants and toddlers increased their future earnings by 25 per-
cent—equivalent to that of adults who grew up in wealthier households.19
Despite their efficiency in producing important skills, early childhood 
investments are underprovided. Some 250 million children under age 5 are 
at risk of not reaching their developmental potential in low- and middle- 
income countries because of stunting or extreme poverty. Worldwide, more 
than 87 million children under age 7 have spent their entire lives in conflict- 
affected areas. They suffer from extreme trauma and toxic stress, which 
impair their brain development and skill enhancement. Only half of all 3- to 
6-year-olds have access to preprimary education globally—in low-income 
countries this share is one-fifth. In 2012 North America and Western Europe 
spent 8.8 percent of their education budgets on preprimary education; in 
Sub-Saharan Africa the share allocated was only 0.3 percent. 
Children from poor families are the least likely to attend early childhood 
development programs (figure 4.4). They would also likely benefit the most 
from such programs. In low- and middle-income countries, approximately 
47 percent of the wealthiest families have access to early education pro-
grams, but for the poorest families this number is 20 percent.20 Rural families 
are especially disadvantaged. Across a sample of 14 low- and middle-income 

76    |    WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2019
countries, rural dwellers consistently have worse access to early childhood 
development programs, compared with those living in urban areas.21 
Effective pathways to early childhood development are available. In 
some places, community-based playgroups have produced consistently 
positive low-cost results. In Indonesia, a playgroup program positively 
affected children’s language, sociobehavioral, and cognitive skills. Children 
from disadvantaged backgrounds benefited more in both the short and long 
term.22 In Tonga, organizing playgroups for children up to age 5 significantly 
improved their early-grade reading skills. The Montessori model, character-
ized by multi­age classrooms, student-chosen learning activities, and min-
imal instruction, has been shown to be more effective than conventional 
education in improving children’s executive functions. With successful local 
adaptations, Montessori and other child-centered approaches—including 
Steiner, Reggio Emilia, and Tools of the Mind—can be found in diverse  
settings, from Haiti to Kenya.
Research has uncovered several concrete ways to increase take-up of 
early childhood development investments. Cash transfers that support early 
childhood development for the poorest children have succeeded in various 
contexts. Such programs have reduced stunting in the Philippines and Sen-
egal, fostered language development in Ecuador and Mexico, and improved 
children’s sociobehavioral skills in Niger. Integrated approaches that com-
bine health, nutrition, and stimulation investments have also been highly 
effective. Chile’s Crece Contigo program integrates the services provided by 
the health, education, welfare, and protection services so that a child’s first 
contact with the system occurs while still in the womb during the mother’s 
first prenatal visit.

Tertiary education
The Free University of Tbilisi was established in 2007 through a nonprofit 
organization. It has already become the top-performing, most sought-after 
university in Georgia. This success stems from a transparent admissions 
process (national competitive entry examinations), as well as a compet-
itive state financing program for individual students based on academic 
performance. Per capita financing increases the efficiency and transpar-
ency of university financing, allowing the government to gradually reduce 
lump-sum payments to universities directly. The university offers a high- 
quality faculty, flexible course offerings, and discussion-based pedagogy. Each 
year, the university attracts hundreds of top-tier applicants, and more than 
96 percent of its graduates find employment or enroll in further education.
Integrated, technology-driven economies are increasingly valuing ter-
tiary education (defined as any education beyond the high school level, 
including trade schools and college). The global average private return to 
tertiary education is 16 percent.23 But such a return is not high for every-
one. It depends on a range of factors that include the quality of the pro-
vider, the composition of the student population, and the availability of 
jobs. Controlling for other factors, students attending a top university in 
Colombia earn 20 percent more than those who just failed to achieve the 
score required for university admission.24 The return also varies dramatically 
depending on the specialization. In Chile, the return to tertiary education 
ranges from 4 percent for humanities to 126 percent for engineering and 
technology.25 Tertiary enrollment and expenditure also vary considerably 
by region (figure 4.5). 
The changing nature of work makes tertiary education more attractive 
in three ways. First, technology and integration have increased the demand 
for higher-order general cognitive skills—such as complex problem-solving, 
critical thinking, and advanced communication—that are transferable across 
jobs but cannot be acquired through schooling alone. The rising demand for 
these skills has enhanced the wage premiums of tertiary graduates, while 
reducing the demand for less educated workers. Second, tertiary education 
increases the demand for lifelong learning. Workers are expected to have 
multiple careers, not just multiple jobs over their lifetime. Tertiary educa-
tion—with its wide array of course offerings and flexible delivery models 
such as online learning and open universities—meets this growing demand. 
Third, tertiary education—especially universities—becomes more attractive 
in the changing world of work by serving as a platform for innovation.
The relevance of tertiary education systems for the future of work depends 
on how well they deliver on these three fronts. Increasingly, skills acquisi-
tion is a continuum, not a finite, unchangeable path. Flexibility is increased 
by ensuring that when students open the door to one pathway, the doors to 
other pathways do not close irrevocably. For example, when first undertaking 
a tertiary education most students must choose between general education 
and vocational training. General education such as programs on engineering 

78    |    WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2019
or economics equip students with the transferable higher-order skills that 
determine their overall learning readiness or trainability. By contrast, voca-
tional training, such as programs on nursing or airport operations, is directly 
related to specific occupations. Once this choice is made—especially if it is for 
vocational training—it is typically difficult and expensive to reverse. 
The relative returns to general and vocational education are changing in 
unpredictable ways, and most economies continue to demand both. Tech-
nological progress tends to lower the demand for certain occupation-specific 
skills, making certain vocational degrees obsolete. It also leads to a higher 
depreciation of narrow job-specific skills compared with general skills. Yet 
vocational training continues to be pursued by many students. In 2012 
63 percent of Dutch higher education students were attending vocational 
training.26 This share was more than 50 percent in Malaysia and 31 percent

in Kenya in 2013.27 Vocational training meets the immediate demand for 
technical skills, enables faster education-to-work transitions for some, and 
alleviates pressure on the university system.
Three factors make flexibility between the general and technical tracks 
imperative for the changing nature of work. First, the combination of gen-
eral and technical skills is becoming highly valued. Second, even technical 
jobs seem to be requiring more and more intensive higher-order general 
skills, implying that this type of skills acquisition should be accessible before 
and during one’s working life. Third, people trained in narrow vocational 
skills would benefit from opportunities to gain new skills. For example, the 
Democratic Republic of Congo and Tanzania offer “bridging” arrangements 
that enable vocational graduates to continue to university.
Close collaboration between industry and vocational education also plays 
a role. In China, Lenovo is working with tertiary institutes to train vocational 
students in high-tech areas, such as cloud computing, that feature practice- 
based curricula, practitioner-led instruction, and professional certification. 
Filling in information gaps enables students to make choices between and 
within different paths. Chile is establishing online platforms where students 
can access information on the employability of individuals with various 
degrees, wage profiles, and courses to take for certain occupations.
Tertiary systems have not remained impervious to these changing 
demands—general and vocational tracks often intersect. A wide range of 
programs offered by universities have a vocational dimension or orientation, 
including many in science, engineering, and technology. Technology-enabled 
platforms are making tertiary education more available, especially for those 
with historically low access. The five largest distance-learning programs are 
based in lower- or middle-income countries. India is the second-largest con-
sumer of massive open online courses (MOOCs). XuetangX, China’s biggest 
MOOC and blended learning portal, was serving 10 million students in 2018. 
In Brazil, Veduca launched the world’s first open online master’s in business 
administration program in 2013 and was offering over 5,000 courses in 2018. 
MOOCs are a promising way of delivering flexible, personalized education 
to a large population. But ensuring quality is a serious challenge. According 
to a recent study, students who took a course online performed worse than 
those who followed in-person instructions. Besides content, many MOOCs 
fail on student engagement or instructor quality.
Tertiary education systems should guarantee a minimum threshold of 
transferable cognitive skills, which are the best inoculation against job uncer-
tainty. But not all systems are effective at producing these skills. Colombia’s 
universities vary significantly in their ability to impart foundational higher- 
order skills such as critical thinking, problem-solving, and communication. 
A study of Chinese undergraduates in engineering and computer science 
suggests that their cognitive skills did not improve much during the first two 
years of college.
Incorporating more general education in tertiary programs is one way 
to increase the acquisition of transferable higher-order cognitive skills. An 
additional year of general education was added in 2012 to undergraduate 

80    |    WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2019
programs in Hong Kong SAR, China, focusing on problem-solving, critical 
thinking, communication, leadership, and lifelong learning skills. For a large 
majority of students, this change seems to be effectively promoting desirable 
graduate attributes. Another way is through innovative pedagogy. The Fac-
ulty of Architecture and Environmental Design at the College of Science and 
Technology–University of Rwanda has promoted learning strategies that 
include open-ended assessment, feedback opportunities, and a progressive 
curriculum that balances academic challenge with student support. These 
approaches have improved the critical thinking skills of students.
Tertiary education also builds transferable sociobehavioral skills such 
as teamwork, resilience, self-confidence, negotiation, and self-expression. 
In a survey of employers of engineers in India, sociobehavioral skills were 
ranked at or above technical qualifications and credentials in terms of their 
significance for the employability of recent graduates. Employer surveys in 
Bulgaria, Georgia, Kazakhstan, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, 
Poland, the Russian Federation, and Ukraine indicate that employers see a 
lack of sociobehavioral skills as at least as problematic as a lack of technical 
skills.
Forward-looking universities are finding ways for adult students to 
acquire sociobehavioral skills. Dutch vocational colleges are providing 
entrepreneurial courses aimed at improving noncognitive skills such as 
teamwork and self-confidence. In Tunisia, introducing an entrepreneurship 
track that combines business training with personal coaching reshaped the 
behavioral skills of university students. In China, a combination of coop-
erative learning and role play enhanced self-educational abilities and com-
munication skills among undergraduate students in pharmacology classes. 
However, better teaching of sociobehavioral skills does require the appro-
priate curricula and accurate measurement, especially in the context of low- 
income countries and rural areas.
The role of tertiary education systems as centers of innovation is highly 
valued as well. Well-known examples of successful university innovation 
clusters are located in the developed world—in the United States at Stanford 
University, University of California, Berkeley (Silicon Valley), and Harvard–
Massachusetts Institute of Technology (Boston’s Route 128); in the United 
Kingdom at the University of Cambridge–University of Oxford–University 
College London (the “golden triangle”). Clusters are also emerging in  
middle-income countries. The University of Malaya in Malaysia has estab-
lished eight interdisciplinary research clusters over the last decade covering 
sustainability science and biotechnology. Peking University is building Clin-
ical Medicine Plus X, a research cluster for precision medicine, health big 
data, and intelligence medicine. As part of the Startup India initiative, seven 
new research parks have been established on Indian Institute of Technol-
ogy campuses to promote innovation through incubation and collaboration 
between universities and private sector firms. In Mexico, the Research and 
Technology Innovation Park currently houses more than 30 research cen-
ters covering research and development in biotechnology, nanotechnology, 
and robotics. Seven of the centers are led by universities.

Lifelong learning    |    81
Two main factors matter for a healthy innovation ecosystem. First, pri-
oritize the right university for the right sector. The agglomeration effects 
of universities vary by sector. Second, recognize that a healthy innova-
tion ecosystem requires an enabling environment. Just because successful 
innovation clusters exist does not mean there is a guaranteed formula for 
their creation. However, governments are often responsible for creating the 
enabling environment in which innovation clusters flourish by providing 
local infrastructure, increasing the expenditure on research and develop-
ment, connecting universities with high-quality researchers and private 
sector innovation, and easing rigid labor market regulations.
Adult learning outside the workplace
As the nature of work changes, some workers are caught in the crosshairs of 
ongoing disruptions in the skills required. As economies rejig to provide the 
human capital of the next generation, the current working-age population 
becomes anxious about its job prospects.
One step toward lessening this anxiety is adult learning aimed at sup-
plying workers who are not in school or in jobs with new or updated skills. 
However, this approach has shown more promise in theory than in practice. 
Bad design too often gets in the way. Adult learning can be improved in 
three ways: more systematic diagnoses of the specific constraints that adults 
are facing; pedagogies that are customized to the adult brain; and flexible 
delivery models that fit in well with adult lifestyles. Adult learning is an 
important channel for readjusting skills to fit in the future of work, but it 
would benefit from a serious design rethink.
Adult learning programs come in many different forms. This section 
mainly focuses on three types that are particularly relevant to preparing 
adults for the changing labor markets: programs on adult literacy; skills 
training for wage employment; and entrepreneurship programs. 
Worldwide, more than 2.1 billion working-age adults (ages 15–64) have 
low reading proficiency. In Sub-Saharan Africa, nearly 61 percent of workers 
are not proficient in reading; in Latin America and the Caribbean this share 
is 44 percent. In India, only 24 percent of 18- to 37-year-olds who drop 
out of school before completing the primary level can read.28 A low-quality 
education also may lead to poor literacy skills (figure 4.6). In Bolivia, Ghana, 
and Kenya more than 40 percent of 19- to 20-year-olds with an upper sec-
ondary education score below the basic literacy level, compared with only  
3 percent in Vietnam. This is a problem. Given the future of work, functional 
literacy is a survival skill. The economic and social cost of adult illiteracy to 
developing countries is estimated at more than US$5 billion a year.29
Even with basic literacy skills, many people leave school too early to thrive 
in work or life. Reasons may be economic or cultural constraints, the low 
quality of basic education, or both. In 2014 the dropout rate from a lower 
secondary general education was, on average, 27.5 percent in low-income 
countries and 13.3 percent and 4.8 percent in middle- and high-income 
countries, respectively.30 It is difficult for early school leavers to find jobs or 

82    |    WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2019
pursue further education later in life without formal certification and train-
ing in skills. Similar constraints are also faced by many adults who stayed in 
school but received a poor-quality basic education.
Globally, some 260 million people ages 15–24 are out of school and out 
of work. A pool of unemployed adults is a political risk as well as an eco-
nomic concern. At times, it leads to a wave of emigration, social unrest, or 
political upheaval. Insufficient economic opportunities for an increasingly 
educated population were a major catalyst of the 2010–11 Arab Spring. 
Changing demographics place additional pressures on the labor market. 
Many rich countries are trying to equip a smaller, older workforce with 
new skills for the changing nature of work, to sustain economic growth. 
Other countries with big youth cohorts are struggling with a low-skill labor 
force trapped in low-productivity jobs.
Adult learning programs update the skills and retool and improve the 
adaptability of older workers. India’s Saakshar Bharat initiative, launched in 
2009, seeks to provide 70 million adults with literacy. In Ghana, adult liter-
acy programs have yielded labor market returns of more than 66 percent.31 
The Mexican National Institute for Adult Education has developed flexible 
modules to deliver education programs equivalent to a primary or second-
ary education. They are intended to give out-of-school individuals a second

chance. Under the World Bank’s Nepal: Adolescent Girls Employment Ini-
tiative, vocational training for women has increased employment outside of 
agriculture by 174 percent.32 Argentina’s Entra21 program is providing adult 
skills training and internships, resulting in 40 percent higher earnings for its 
participants.33 Kenya’s Ninaweza program is offering skills training to young 
women living in informal settlements in Nairobi. The program has led to a 
14 percent increase in the likelihood of obtaining a job, higher earnings, and 
more self-confident participants.34 
But many adult learning programs fail to generate a meaningful impact. 
Adult literacy programs often improve word recognition but fail to improve 
actual reading comprehension.35 In Niger, an adult education program 
increased reading speed, but not to the level required for reading compre-
hension (the minimum reading speed for reading comprehension is one 
word every 1.5 seconds). Entrepreneurship programs often improve busi-
ness knowledge, but they do not create employment. In Peru, training for 
female entrepreneurs improved business, but it did not generate a signifi-
cant increase in employment. Vocational training for the unemployed often 
improves short-run earnings but not always long-run employment. The 
Dominican Republic’s Juventud y Empleo (Youth and Employment) pro-
gram improved noncognitive skills and job formality, but it did not increase 
employment. And Turkey’s vocational training had no significant impacts 
on overall employment, and the positive effects on employment quality 
faded in the long term. 
Even among successful adult learning programs, the costs are high. In 
Liberia, even though young women with access to job skills training enjoy 
higher monthly earnings—US$11 more than the comparison group—the 
cost of the program is US$1,650 per person.36 Thus 12 years of stable effects 
must pass for the training program to recoup its costs. In Latin America, 
a long time is required for some programs to attain positive net present 
values if their benefits are sustained—for example, seven years for ProJoven 
(Program for Young People) in Peru and 12 years for Proyecto Joven (Young 
Project) in Argentina.37 Adult learning is frequently just one expensive 
component of a comprehensive package, making it difficult to understand a 
program’s cost-effectiveness. The Chilean Micro Entrepreneurship Support 
Program boosted self-employment by 15 percentage points in the short run, 
but it is not clear how much of this can be attributed to the 60-hour business 
training or the US$600 capital injection.38
The two main reasons for low effectiveness are a suboptimal design 
and an incorrect diagnosis. Adult brains learn differently—and that is not 
always factored into program design. Because the brain’s ability to learn 
lessens with age, adult learning programs face a built-in challenge: acquiring 
knowledge when the brain is less efficient at learning. Advances in neuro-
science suggest how to tackle this factor. An adult brain’s ability to learn is 
significantly dependent on how much it is used. Adult learning programs 
have a better chance of success if lessons are integrated into everyday life. 

84    |    WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2019
In Niger, students who received instruction via their mobile phones as part 
of an adult education program achieved reading and math scores that were 
significantly higher than those who did not. 
Adults face significant stress, which compromises their mental capacity— 
and that, too, is not always factored into program design. For adults, emo-
tions are constantly mediated by the demands of family, child care, and 
work. These demands compete with the cognitive capacity required for 
learning. In India, sugarcane farmers were found to have a markedly dimin-
ished cognitive capacity when they were poorer (during preharvest) than 
when they were richer (during postharvest). Creating emotional cues linked 
to learning content—such as goal-setting—can be an effective strategy to 
increase adult learning. But behavioral tools are rarely integrated into adult 
learning programs.
Adults face specific socioeconomic constraints—and, again, these are not 
always factored into the design of adult learning programs. Adult learners 
have high opportunity costs in terms of lost income and lost time with their 
children, but programs often have inflexible and intensive schedules. In 
Malawi, participation in training resulted in a decline in personal savings 
for women at a rate nearly double that of men. Distance to training loca-
tions and lack of child care were significant barriers for women trying to 
complete vocational training programs in India. For adult literacy programs, 
dropout rates are often high, ranging from 17 percent in Niger to 58 percent 
in India.39
Low participation in adult learning programs is a sign that they are not 
always the answer. In Pakistan’s Skills for Employability program, even 
among poor households who expressed interest in vocational skills, more 
than 95 percent did not enroll when given a voucher. Even when the gov-
ernment increased daily stipends and moved the training centers to villages, 
enrollment did not exceed 25 percent.40 In Ghana, the demand for training 
by informal businesses is low because most managers do not see lack of skills 
as a constraint.
Three promising routes to more effective adult learning programs are  
better diagnosis and evaluation, better design, and better delivery. 
For better diagnosis and evaluation, systematic data collection before 
program design will identify the most important constraints for the target 
population. This information is also useful for customizing skills training. 
Administrative data from India’s massive National Rural Employment Guar-
antee Act program has offered powerful insights into local labor markets.
There is tremendous scope for improving the design of adult learning 
programs using insights from neuroscience and behavioral economics. Both 
practical exercises and visual aids are effective in adult learning because 
they help memory. Including motivational tools such as financial rewards, 

Lifelong learning    |    85
work experience, or frequent feedback have all been shown to boost adult 
learning. An experiment among young adults shows that offering rewards 
increases long-term performance gains after training.
As for delivery, flexible adult learning programs allow adults to learn at 
their convenience. In a voucher program for vocational training in Kenya, 
nearly 50 percent of women cited proximity to a training center as a deter-
mining factor in choosing a course.41 Given competing demands on adults’ 
time, training programs with short modules delivered through mobile appli-
cations are particularly promising. Delivering training programs via mobile 
phones better shields adult learners from potential stigma. 
Adult learning programs are more successful when they are explicitly 
linked to employment opportunities. One popular way to do this is through 
apprenticeships or internships that link training to day-to-day experience 
and provide motivation through the promise of future economic returns. 
Skills training programs are more successful when the private sector is 
involved in developing the curriculum or training methods or in providing 
on-the-job training via internships or apprenticeships. Colombia’s Jóvenes 
en Acción (Youth in Action) program combines classroom instruction with 
on-the-job training at private companies. The probability of formal employ-
ment and earnings rose in the short term and has been sustained in the 
long run. The program has also demonstrated strong education effects, with 
participants more likely to complete secondary school and to pursue higher 
education eight years after the training. The likelihood of their family mem-
bers enrolling in tertiary education also has increased.
The success of adult learning programs may also depend on addressing 
multiple constraints at the same time. Combining training with cash or capi-
tal in some cases is a direct way to boost effectiveness. In Cameroon, 54,000 
people who participated in a program that coupled training with financial 
assistance found employment.42 Combining skills training with skills certif-
icates, referral letters, and better information about job opportunities also 
may enhance effectiveness, especially for women. In Uganda, workers with 
more certifiable, transferrable skills have higher employment rates, higher 
earnings, and greater labor market mobility. A World Bank program in 
South Africa is attempting to improve job searches through peer support, 
text message reminders, and action planning.
Incorporating soft skills or sociobehavioral skills in training design has 
shown promise. In Togo, teaching informal business owners “personal ini-
tiative”—a mindset of self-starting behavior, innovation, and goal-setting—
boosted the profits of firms by 30 percent two years after the program. This 
approach was much more effective than traditional business training. For 
factory workers in India, acquiring skills such as time management, effective 
communication, and financial management increased their productivity.

CHAPTER 5
 
Returns to work

L
earning does not end in school. Students who move into jobs have 
an opportunity to continue to accumulate human capital, but they 
face obstacles. For one thing, the emerging economies have a large 
informal sector. People working in this sector tend to be in low- 
productivity jobs that do not provide learning or stable sources of income. 
By creating the conditions for formal sector jobs, governments can offer 
better learning and income opportunities for the poor. Another obstacle is 
that women are often excluded from work. And yet another is that the poor 
in emerging economies are concentrated in rural areas in the agriculture 
sector. Raising their productivity is crucial to gaining human capital.
One of the fathers of labor economics quantified the payoffs from work 
and school. Before Jacob Mincer took on this subject in the 1970s, the com-
mon belief among his contemporaries was that luck determined a person’s 
ability, which in turn determined payoffs. Mincer proved that earnings dif-
ferentials are influenced by human capital investments that grow over the 
life cycle, initially in school and later at work. The payoff of such investments 
can be measured in terms of increased earnings, or “returns,” stemming 
from an additional year spent in school or work. For example, Mincer found 
that for white males in nonfarm wage jobs an additional year of education 
increased earnings by 10.7 percent.1
Workers in emerging economies face lower payoffs to work experience 
than their counterparts in advanced economies (figure 5.1). In the Nether-
lands and Sweden, one additional year of work raises wages by 5.5 percent. 
In Afghanistan, the corresponding figure is 0.3 percent. A worker in an 
emerging economy is more likely than a worker in an advanced economy to 
engage in a manual occupation, where there is less scope for learning as well 
as a greater risk of automation. Moreover, compared with advanced econ-
omies, emerging economies have a poorly educated workforce. Advanced 
economies are often at the cutting edge of technology, and their workers 
tend to be highly educated, formally employed, and have access to a wide 
range of jobs filled with nonroutine, cognitive tasks. This may explain the 
higher returns to work in advanced economies than in emerging economies. 
Comparing returns to work between manual and cognitive occupations 
reveals that an additional year of work in cognitive professions increases 
wages by 2.9 percent, whereas for manual occupations the figure is 1.9 per-
cent.2 Elementary occupations such as cleaners as well as skilled agricultural 
workers have the lowest returns. Professionals, managers, and technicians 
have the highest.
The workplace is a venue where skills can be acquired after school. 
Never­theless, work is a complement to schooling, not a substitute for it. 
Global differences in school education explain much of the observed varia-
tion in earnings. One additional year spent in school produces, on average, 
the same increase in wages as spending four years at work. A worker would 
need to spend three years on the job in Germany, five years in Malawi, and 
eight years in Guatemala to match the effect of an extra year of school-
ing on wages. Policies that raise returns to work are likely to benefit more

people in emerging economies because many of these workers are excluded 
from the school system.
Educated workers have greater scope for learning at work than uned-
ucated workers. For each additional year of work experience, poorly edu-
cated workers have annual wage growth of 2 percent. By contrast, workers 
with high levels of education have annual returns to work of 2.4 percent. 
As a result, countries with poor schools face double jeopardy. First, young 
adults graduating from high school are not equipped with the skills to find 
work. Second, even if they find work they earn and learn less than more 
educated individuals. 
Consider Jordan, a country with low returns to both education (5.9 per-
cent) and experience (1.2 percent), together with below-average Programme 
for International Student Assessment (PISA) scores in math, science, and 
reading. A worker who completes secondary education in Jordan and one 
year at work would earn less than half of her counterpart in Germany. 
Moreover, by the time she accumulates 30 years of experience, the German 
worker’s wage would already be at least five times higher than hers.

bution Data Set.
Note: The figure provides estimates of the percentage increase in wages from an additional year of potential work expe-
rience across 135 economies by income level. For high-income economies, the mean is 4.0 percent. On average, then, 
an additional year of work experience increases monthly wages by 4.0 percent in high-income economies. The top and 
bottom economies for each income group are shown. Thus an additional year of experience raises monthly wages by 5.5 
percent in Sweden, but only by 2.1 percent in Lithuania. The methodology follows previous work by categorizing years 
of experience into seven bins (Lagakos et al. 2018). Wage growth is estimated for each bin relative to the no-experience 
bin. The returns to experience are then calculated as an average of the seven bins, using a geometric mean. The top and 
bottom economy listed for each income group are ranked after the estimates account for income and life expectancy of 
the economy.

Informality
The informal economy is omnipresent in most emerging economies. Infor-
mal employment stands at more than 70 percent in Sub-Saharan Africa and 
60 percent in South Asia and at more than 50 percent in Latin America. In 
Kenya, informal employment is a staggering 77.9 percent of total employ-
ment, one of the highest rates on the African continent. Almost 6 million 
businesses in Kenya’s informal sector are unlicensed. And productivity is 
low in this sector: in emerging economies informal workers are, on average, 
only 15 percent as productive as formal workers.3
The informal sector is slow to change. Since 1999, India has seen its 
information technology sector boom; it has become a nuclear power; it has 
broken the world record in the number of satellites launched into outer 
space using a single rocket; and it has achieved an annual growth rate of 
5.6 percent. Yet the size of its informal sector has remained at about 90 
percent.4 This pattern is not unique to India. Informal sectors in emerging 
economies are a fixture. In Madagascar, the percentage of nonagricultural 
informal workers increased from 74 percent in 2005 to 89 percent in 2012. 
In Nicaragua, informality rose from 72.4 percent in 2005 to 75 percent in 
2010.5
Analyses based on the World Bank’s International Income Distribution 
Data Set show that the returns to experience for a worker are higher in 
the formal sector than in the informal sector. For example, a year spent 
in the informal sector in Kenya raises income by only 2.7 percent a year. 
By contrast, workers in the formal sector in Kenya raise their income by  
4.1 percent every year, which is approximately 1.5 times higher than for 
incomes in the informal sector. The difference is potent.
The disparity in the payoffs from work between formal and informal jobs 
is a global phenomenon. In Nepal, returns to experience are 1.4 times higher 
for formal wage workers over informal wage workers. In South Africa, they 
are 1.6 times higher in the formal sector than in the informal sector, and 
in India they are over twice as high as in the informal sector. In emerging 
economies, on average, the earnings increase for an additional year of work 
for informal wage workers is 1.4 percent, whereas it is 1.8 percent for formal 
wage workers.
The millions of informal businesses run by the poor are unlikely to make 
their owners rich. Typically, they have no paid staff and tend to be barely 
profitable. In Dakar, Senegal, 87 percent of firms with labor productivity 
below US$10,000 per worker are in the informal sector.6 Informal firms 
are run by uneducated owners, serve low-income consumers, and use little 
capital—informal firms add only 15 percent of the value per employee of 
formal firms.7 They also rarely move to the formal sector. 
The poor manage to make a lot out of little, but the businesses they run 
are too small to raise their livelihoods. These enterprises do not provide a 
stable income stream, leaving the poor vulnerable to unexpected events. Yet 
they have no other options. The enterprises of the poor are a way to work 
when formal employment is unavailable. 

Returns to work    |    95
Creating stable formal private jobs for the poor is an important policy 
goal. Stable jobs allow poor workers to make commitments to expenditures. 
Factory jobs dramatically improve the lives of the poor.8 Improvements in 
infrastructure in towns and villages could encourage formal firms to estab-
lish themselves near poor workers. Although small-scale informal enter-
prises are unlikely to formalize and grow, the owners of informal firms may 
obtain formal jobs. 
Countries that more heavily regulate their businesses have larger unof-
ficial economies.9 Mexico is a good illustration of what happens when a 
country streamlines its business regulation. In May 2002 Mexico began 
to implement its Rapid Business Opening System. The program simplified 
local business registration procedures and reduced the average number of 
days it takes to register a business from 30 to 2, the number of required 
procedures from 8 to 3, and the number of office visits required to register 
a business from 4 to 1. The Federal Commission for Improving Regulation 
organized the reform, coordinating with municipal governments because 
many business registration procedures are set locally in Mexico. Because of 
the reforms, informal business owners who were similar in profile to formal 
wage workers were 25 percent more likely to move into formal employ-
ment.10 The evidence suggests that easing regulation encourages the transi-
tion from informal firm ownership to formal wage jobs. 
At times, streamlining business has to be carried out in tandem with other 
policies. In Brazil, the Individual Micro-Entrepreneur Program, introduced 
in 2009, targeted entrepreneurs who employ at most one person. The pro-
gram was designed to reduce the dimensions of formality costs—registra-
tion (entry) costs and the costs of remaining formal—by reducing monthly 
taxes and red tape. Reducing business registration costs while reducing taxes 
resulted in the formalization of existing informal firms. Industries eligible 
for tax reduction experienced a 5 percent increase in the number of formal 
firms. Halving monthly taxes led to a 2 percent increase in the registration 
rate for entrepreneurs, from a baseline rate of 20 percent.11
Governments can also use technology to reduce informality. The intro-
duction of e-Payroll was an important factor in the reduction of nonagricul-
tural informal employment in Peru from 75 percent in 2004 to 68 percent 
in 2012. Employers use e-Payroll to send monthly reports to the National 
Tax Authority on their workers, pensioners, service providers, personnel 
in training, outsourced workers, and claimants. E-payroll, which became 
available in 2008, resulted in the registration of about 300,000 new formal 
jobs in that year, after accounting for economic growth.12 
Investments in human capital reduce informal employment. When young 
people are equipped with the right skills they are more likely to obtain a 
formal job. A youth training program in Santo Domingo, the capital of the 
Dominican Republic, targeted youths between the ages of 16 and 29 who 
did not attend school and were living in poor neighborhoods.13 The program 
offered skills training courses that lasted 225 hours: 150 hours devoted to 
teaching a wide range of low skills for jobs such as administrative assistant, 
hair stylist, and mechanic, and 75 hours devoted to improving the soft skills 

96    |    WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2019
of participants (mainly work habits and self-esteem). Courses were followed 
by a three-month internship in a private firm. Evaluation of the program 
revealed that skills investment in youth training has a significant impact on 
the probability of securing a formal job and on earnings in an urban labor 
market. And these gains last over time.
Working women
The mural The Making of a Fresco Showing the Building of a City by Mexican 
painter Diego Rivera (1886–1957) was chosen for the cover of this study. A 
communist, Rivera depicts a gigantic worker towering over bankers, archi-
tects, and artists. But only one woman appears among the 19 people in the 
mural. Although the status of women in the economy has improved since 
Rivera’s time, a considerable gap remains in the economic opportunities 
available to women and men.
Some societies exclude women from work. Across the world, 49 percent 
of women over the age of 15 are employed, compared with 75 percent of 
men. Gender imbalances persist in positions of power. In less than a fifth of 
firms is a woman the top manager.14 However, these numbers mask wide 
differences among countries. In Sweden, 61 percent of women are formally 
employed. In Italy, the figure is 40 percent. In India and Pakistan, only 
25–27 percent of women are in the labor force. Generally, women work 
in less economically productive sectors and in occupations with potentially 
lower on-the-job learning opportunities.
The inclusion of women in formal economic activity depends on equal 
property rights. In ancient Greece, women could not inherit property rights, 
while in ancient Rome they had no political rights. In 1804 the Napole-
onic Code stated that wives were under the purview of their fathers and 
husbands. Before 1870, married women in the United Kingdom had no 
right to claim property, and full ownership rights belonged to the husband. 
Although gender parity has improved around the world, major differences 
persist. 
Women face sector-specific legal restrictions in obtaining jobs across 
many countries. Sixty-five economies restrict women from mining jobs; 47 
impose restrictions in manufacturing; and 37 restrict women from construc-
tion jobs. Furthermore, in 29 of 189 economies women cannot work the 
same hours as men.
Men outnumber women in every occupation (figure 5.2). Only about 
a quarter of managers are women, and women are about 39 percent of 
professionals. Across occupations, women have a relatively higher presence 
in both clerical support and services and sales occupations (44 percent). The 
lowest presence is as plant and machine operators and assemblers, where 
women fill just 16 percent of such positions. Most female managers of for-
mal firms in emerging economies are in the retail sector.
Women generally face lower payoffs from work experience (1.9 percent) 
than men (3.1 percent). In República Bolivariana de Venezuela, for each 
additional year of work, men’s wages increase by 2.2 percent, compared 

Returns to work    |    97
with only 1.5 percent for women. The difference is even larger for countries 
such as Mali, where returns for men are 3.1 percent, but only 1.6 percent 
for women. A woman in Mali would have to accumulate almost two years 
more experience for every year her male coworker accumulates to earn the 
same wage increase. In Denmark, by contrast, this figure is 5 percent for 
both men and women. 
There are many reasons for these different payoffs between men and 
women. Consider a working couple in Bangladesh who are contemplating 
conceiving their first baby. Bangladeshi laws do not prescribe paid or unpaid 
parental leave, so an equivalent job is not guaranteed for the mother after 
giving birth. Nursing mothers are not entitled to nursing breaks, and the 
law does not allow flexible or part-time schedules. Bangladesh’s returns to 
work experience for women is 0.8 percent—almost half of the returns for 
men. By contrast, in Portugal, Spain, and Sweden—all countries with paid 
leave for both men and women—the returns to work experience are similar 
across genders.
Better information encourages change. As a response, the World Bank 
began the Women, Business and the Law project in 2008 to document the 
gender legal disparities for 189 economies. Removing legal restrictions for 
women is powerful. Simply mandating a nondiscrimination clause in hir-
ing increases, in terms of gender, women’s employment in formal firms by  
8.6 percent.15 Mandating paternity leave to encourage a more equitable 
distribution of child-rearing activities between men and women raises, on 
average, the proportion of women employed in formal firms by 6.8 percent-
age points.16

The larger the number of legal restrictions women face, the lower is the 
payoff from work experience (f﻿igure 5.3). At one end of the spectrum, 
Denmark, France, the Netherlands, and Sweden have fewer legal gender 
restrictions and higher returns to work for women. In Afghanistan, Jordan, 
and the Republic of Yemen, where women and men are treated differently 
by law, the payoff from work experience for women is among the lowest. 
Increasing legal gender-specific restrictions discourages women from both 
owning and managing firms.17 It is certainly possible that changes in the 
laws are not causing higher returns to work experience for women and 
that something else is. Nevertheless, laws are relatively easy to change and 
should be a natural first step.
Countries are reforming. Since changes to the family code in the Demo-
cratic Republic of Congo in 2016, a woman is allowed to register her busi-
ness, open a bank account, apply for a loan, sign a contract, and register land 
without her husband’s permission. Zambia’s Gender Equity and Equality 
Act of 2015 prohibits gender discrimination in employment. Iraq guaran-
tees workers returning after maternity leave a similar position and the same 
wage. China has increased its paid paternity leave. Afghanistan forbids sex-
ual harassment in employment and education. Sixty-five countries made 
gender equality reforms between 2015 and 2017.
Reforming discriminatory laws and programs so they empower women 
by giving them access to training and assets improves their well-being. In 
Bangladesh, poor women generally work as maids or agricultural workers,

and wealthy women rear livestock. A nationwide program changed lives by 
providing poor women with livestock as well as skills training and advice 
on their legal, social, and political rights. Earnings of many of the women in 
the program rose, the value of their livestock increased, they accumulated 
business assets, and they were more likely to own land. These improve-
ments lasted seven years after the program.18 A similar program in Uganda 
provided adolescent girls with vocational training, together with informa-
tion on sexual health and reproduction to reduce early pregnancy. Four 
years after the program, women were more likely to be engaged in income- 
generating activities.19
Liberia launched the Economic Empowerment of Adolescent Girls and 
Young Women project in 2009. It seeks to provide young girls with both 
in-classroom training—focusing on life and technical skills highly demanded 
in the market—and follow-up job placement support (to either enter a pay-
ing job or start a new business). The program significantly improved par-
ticipants’ lives: employment and earnings increased by 47 and 80 percent, 
respectively; participating women saved US$35 more than a control group 
over a 14-month period; and their self-confidence, life satisfaction, and 
social abilities improved. Households with participating women improved 
their food security by increasing the consumption of high-value proteins, 
while decreasing the likelihood of food shortages.20 
Working in agriculture
Agriculture remains the main economic sector in low-income countries, 
especially in rural areas, even as the number of jobs it supports falls as econ-
omies develop. In 2017 agriculture accounted for 68 percent of employment 
in low-income economies. Improving agricultural incomes is therefore an 
effective way of reducing poverty.21 However, the combined forces of auto-
mation and open trade work against agricultural employment in developing 
countries. Meanwhile, capital-intensive agriculture in advanced economies 
may be reducing the demand for imports from developing economies.
The result is faster urbanization in Africa and South Asia, where the chal-
lenges of moving to cities proliferate. On the one hand, earnings could rise: 
in emerging economies an additional year of city work experience is worth a 
2.2 percent increase in pay. The returns to work in urban areas are 1.7 times 
more than in rural areas where agriculture is predominant, or a premium 
of 70 percent. This reflects a global pattern. In Indonesia and Mexico, the 
returns to work are 50 percent higher in urban areas than in rural areas, and 
in China, India, and Vietnam the payoffs are double.
On the other hand, opportunities in the city can be limited. There, work-
ers typically require some level of education to access most of the better 
jobs. In several developing economies, stringent workplace regulation deters 
firms from employing less productive workers, pushing them into the infor-
mal economy.22 
The constraints faced by the poor in moving to cities have been well 
documented. In India, workers in Odisha give at least two reasons for not 

100    |    WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2019
staying in the city.23 First, there is no housing—the poorest often squeeze 
themselves into swamps or slums right next to refuse dumps. By contrast, 
villages offer more open, greener, and quieter spaces. Second, those moving 
their families to the city face considerable risks. If their children fall sick, the 
health care is better in the city, but will anyone lend them money if they are 
in need? The connections developed in villages serve as safety nets for the 
vulnerable lives of the poor. 
To reduce poverty, governments may be tempted to move poor workers 
from villages that mainly rely on agriculture to cities to raise the overall 
payoffs for work experience in the economy. However, this movement 
is unlikely to do much to narrow the payoff gap between emerging and 
advanced economies. Studies conducted in Indonesia and Kenya have 
found that improvements in rural areas are necessary to narrow that gap.24
Between the bustling cities and the subsistence agriculture–oriented vil-
lages lie secondary towns. They play a special role in facilitating the tran-
sition of rural workers to off-farm employment, much of it related to agri-
culture. Secondary towns occupy an important space between villages and 
cities, enabling movement up and down the value chain. The experiences of 
Tanzanian migrants confirm this, highlighting the role that secondary towns 
play in facilitating the transition out of agriculture.25 In the early stages of 
development, growing secondary towns may do more to alleviate rural pov-
erty than cities. But in later stages of development, the cities take over.
As economies develop, agricultural productivity rises, unlike productiv-
ity in the informal sector. But the challenges facing farmers in emerging 
economies are many, and governments play an important part in raising 
productivity. Smallholders have limited access to agricultural inputs such as 
fertilizers and machinery, as well as services that increase their productivity; 
they are not integrated into value chains. Value chain development allows 
farmers to capture the urban demand for higher-value agricultural prod-
ucts such as dairy, meat, fruits, and vegetables. Poverty reduction is faster 
when agriculture shifts from raising staple crops to nonstaple crops. Such a 
step requires raising staple crop productivity well beyond the current levels 
in Sub-Saharan Africa. Policy makers are making progress in some areas. 
Examples are programs that transfer knowledge, and initiatives that exploit 
digital technologies to increase access to input, output, and capital markets. 
Training farmers in the best farming techniques has been shown to raise 
productivity. Some projects expand training programs or collaboration to 
improve the exchange of information. At times, this has been combined 
with increasing access to finance or the inputs required for agriculture as 
an impetus for improving agricultural productivity. Providing coopera-
tives with resources improves linkages between agribusinesses along the 
value chain. JD Finance, the fintech arm of JD.com, a leading Chinese  
e-commerce platform, has been providing farmers with microcredits. For 
example, the Integrated Growth Poles Project in Madagascar, which provided 
farmers with training on improved cocoa processing practices and business 
management skills, resulted in beneficiaries seeing an average increase in 
net revenue of 47 percent. In Afghanistan, farmer field schools, which are 

Returns to work    |    101
part of the National Horticulture and Livestock Project, tripled the income of 
some participants. They have also been successful in East Africa.26 Govern-
ment initiatives to link farmers with producer organizations, agribusiness 
purchasers, and financial institutions in the sorghum sector in northern 
Cameroon had similar effects. 
Agricultural training can be improved. One way is to activate social ties 
in villages to encourage peer learning. A recent study of rural female farm-
ers in Uganda concluded that encouraging them to compete resulted in 
greater learning in training sessions.27 Agricultural extension services can be 
improved through low-cost videos that leverage the knowledge and partici-
pation of local communities. 
Mechanization has in the past failed to take a foothold in Sub-Saharan 
Africa, opening the door to skepticism about ambitious predictions of the 
technological transformation of agriculture. Yet, thanks to new informa-
tion and communications technologies, there are signs that mechanization 
is happening. Instantaneous measurements allow farmers to make better 
decisions. Drones, aerial images from satellites, and soil sensors improve 
measurements and crop monitoring. Detailed information enables farmers 
to decide how much fertilizer and irrigation are appropriate. 
Mobile technology in Kenya is reducing the administrative and assessment 
costs of crop insurance schemes. A good illustration is the app Kilimo Salama 
(Swahili for safe farming), which became ACRE Africa in 2014. The seller 
activates the insurance policy by scanning a product-specific bar code with 
a camera phone, entering the farmer’s mobile number, and connecting the 
farmer to the local weather station. Thirty solar-powered weather stations 
automatically monitor the weather. The farmer receives a text message con-
firming the insurance policy. Indemnity payments are made through the 
M-Pesa platform. By 2017 over a million farmers in Kenya, Rwanda, and 
Tanzania were insured under this project.
Orchard farmers in Kastamonu Province in Turkey must contend with 
pests and frost. The government, in collaboration with international donors, 
established five mini-meteorological stations in rural areas throughout the 
province, along with 14 reference farms to measure rain, temperature, and 
pest cycles. Producers are regularly updated by text message, allowing them 
to react to the prevailing local conditions. Costs fell dramatically for produc-
ers in the first two years of the scheme. Pesticide applications dropped by 
50 percent.
For farmers to profit from increased agricultural productivity, they need 
access to markets, both at home and abroad. Export-oriented agriculture in 
northern and central Mexico provides on-farm job opportunities for millions 
of farmers and for many others off-farm engaged in agrifood processing and 
packaging activities. Alquería, the third-largest dairy company in Colombia, 
is expanding exports—the 13,000 small dairy farmers from which Alquería 
sources raw milk will all benefit from the increased demand overseas. In 
addition to streamlining export processes, improving the trade logistics 
infrastructure, and increasing food safety compliance capacity, governments 
can facilitate exports through exporter training and marketing assistance. 

102    |    WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2019
For example, the Vietnamese government works with industry organiza-
tions to deliver coordinated branding campaigns for tea, coffee, and cashew 
nuts. 
When farmers’ crops finally go to market, many of those in emerging 
economies do not know whether they are getting the best prices. In Uganda, 
TruTrade is an example of a digital technology that is bridging this informa-
tion gap. TruTrade connects smallholders to buyers while raising quality and 
transparency and creating an atmosphere of trust. It uses online applications 
to allow price-setting and to track the movements of produce and payments. 
Farmers receive good prices and reliable access to markets. Traders build 
relationships as trusted providers, thereby growing their businesses. 
Work is the next venue for human capital accumulation after school. 
Poorer economies have much to do because they lag behind advanced 
economies in the returns to work. Governments can raise those returns by 
increasing formal jobs for the poor, enabling women’s economic participa-
tion, and expanding agricultural productivity in rural areas. Formal jobs 
create more learning opportunities. Empowering women will raise the stock 
of human capital in the economy. And expanding agricultural productivity 
in rural areas will provide better work opportunities for the poor. Jobs that 
generate and build skills will prepare workers for the future.

CHAPTER 6
Strengthening
social protection 

O
tto von Bismarck, Germany’s chancellor in the late 19th century,
is widely credited with inventing social insurance—benefi ts for 
workers in the formal sector fi nanced by dedicated taxes on 
wages. What is less known, however, is that this model was 
Bismarck’s plan B. The chancellor’s original intention was to create a system 
of pensions fi nanced by taxes on tobacco. When this plan failed, Bismarck 
resorted to wage-based, contributory fi nancing. 
The Bismarckian model has served many countries well. However, in a 
range of developing countries the model has remained mostly aspirational 
because of the large size of their informal economies. As a result, many 
workers lack social protection. In low-income countries, of those in the 
poorest quintile, only 18 percent are covered by social assistance and 2 
percent by social insurance. The corresponding rates increase to 77 and 28 
percent in upper-middle-income settings. 
This chapter outlines how three main components of social protection sys-
tems—a guaranteed social minimum (with social assistance at its core), social 
insurance, and labor market regulation—can manage labor market chal-
lenges (fi gure 6.1).1 A social minimum includes the set of social assistance 
programs that provide fi nancial support to a large share of the population, or 
even all of it. Already spurred by 
equity concerns, expanded social 
assistance is underscored by the 
growing risks in labor markets 
and the importance of provid-
ing adequate support, no matter 
how a person engages in those 
markets. A guiding principle for 
strengthening social assistance 
is progressive universalism. The 
aim of this approach is to expand 
coverage while giving priority to 
the poorest people. This bottom-
up expansion occurs while nav-
igating the fi scal, practical, and 
political trade-offs that incremen-
tal levels of coverage involve.  
Social assistance should be 
complemented with insurance 
that does not fully depend on 
formal wage employment. An 
arrangement of this nature would 
provide basic universal coverage, subsidizing premiums for the poor and 
topping up social assistance. Mandatory earnings-based contributions would 
also be necessary. This mandate would apply, at least initially, only to formal 
workers. A lighter mandate could attract greater compliance. Additional 
insurance could be achieved through voluntary saving schemes “nudged” 
106

by the state. Disentangling redistribution from savings would reduce labor 
costs. This change may also reduce incentives to replace workers with robots.
Taken together, the expanded coverage of social assistance and the pro-
vision of subsidized social insurance imply a stronger role for governments. 
For example, the desirable level of spending for a societal minimum in devel-
oping countries may, in many cases, be significantly higher than average 
expenditures on social assistance—currently at 1.5 percent of gross domestic 
product (GDP). Progressive universalism calls for gradual expansion in line 
with the prevailing fiscal space.
Enhanced social assistance and insurance reduce the burden on labor 
regulation of having to deal with risk management. As people become 
better protected through enhanced social assistance and insurance sys-
tems, labor regulation could, where appropriate, be made more flexible 
to facilitate movement between jobs. For example, income support for the 
unemployed could be provided by unemployment benefits rather than by 
severance pay. 
Lower labor costs improve the adaptability of firms to the changing nature 
of work, while encouraging greater formal employment, especially of new 
entrants into the labor market and low-skill workers. Informal workers may 
also be better protected. However, a proper balance should be maintained 
between regulation and job creation. Complementary support for learn-
ing new skills, as well as new arrangements for strengthening the voice of  
workers, become even more important. Effective representation of both 
formal and informal sector workers ensures that the “security” element of 
“flexicurity” is preserved. 
Social assistance
“All poor people should have the alternative . . . of being starved by a grad-
ual process in the house, or by a quick one out of it.” With these words, 
Charles Dickens’s Oliver Twist provides a vivid depiction of social assistance 
practices in the 19th-century United Kingdom. The government, as codified 
in the Poor Laws of 1601 and 1834, established harsh criteria for accessing 
social assistance. The laws also influenced thinking about social assistance 
for centuries. It was only 75 years ago that the “Beveridge Report,” with its 
recommendations embedded in the 1948 National Assistance Act, marked 
the end of the era evoked by Dickens.
In subsequent decades, social assistance began to spread to developing 
countries. Trends in social assistance attest to significant global progress. 
Analysis based on 142 countries, including those in the World Bank’s 
database on social protection—the Atlas of Social Protection Indicators of 
Resilience and Equity, ASPIRE—shows that 70 percent have unconditional 
cash transfers in place, and 43 percent rely on conditional cash transfers. 
Meanwhile, 101 countries have old-age social pensions.2
Developing countries are continually expanding their social assistance 
programs. For example, the coverage of the national conditional cash 

108    |    WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2019
transfer scheme in Tanzania increased from 0.4 percent of the population in 
2013 to 10 percent in 2016. An equal level of coverage has been achieved 
by the Productive Safety Net Program in Ethiopia. In the Philippines, about 
20 percent of the population is served by the Pantawid program, and in 
South Africa, by the Child Support Grant. Overall, the cumulative coverage 
of social assistance is 40.1 percent of the 5.1 billion people represented in 
surveys included in ASPIRE.
Social assistance works on many levels. Empirical studies have shown 
that cash transfers are spent on food, health care, education, and other 
desirable goods. Transfers are associated with improvements in the human 
capital of current and future generations. A systematic review of 56 cash 
transfer programs found significant advances in school enrollment rates, test 
scores, cognitive development, food security, and use of health facilities.3 
In Mexico, the Prospera conditional cash transfer program improved motor 
skills, cognitive development, and the receptive language of children from 
age 24 to 68 months. In Kenya, secondary school enrollment increased by 
7 percent for children in the Orphans and Vulnerable Children program. 
These gains are usually largest for the poorest, rural dwellers, girls, and eth-
nic minorities. Cash transfers reduce stress and depression, increase mental 
bandwidth, and foster more involved parenting.4 
Social assistance programs also affect household assets and livelihoods. 
Evaluations in Africa found that livestock ownership increased, on average, 
by 34 percent and ownership of durable goods by 10 percent.5 Programs 
increasingly reinforce livelihood effects by adding elements of awareness- 
raising on nutritional risks, financial inclusion, entrepreneurship training, 
and asset transfers. In other words, social assistance, especially income sup-
port plus interventions, has often raised productivity and resilience among 
informal workers.
In advanced economies, social assistance faces the challenge of low uptake 
among eligible beneficiaries. In the European Union, only about 60 percent 
of social benefits are claimed.6 This challenge stems from a lack of awareness 
of benefits, misunderstanding of eligibility rules, the stigma associated with 
assistance, bureaucratic obstacles, and the opportunity costs of accessing 
benefits. 
In some middle-income countries with high levels of coverage, policy 
makers have weighed the possibility of targeting by excluding the rich 
instead of selecting beneficiaries from the bottom. This approach is often 
considered in the context of large-scale energy and food subsidy reforms. 
The political viability of such a proposition may then depend on how the 
middle class and various interest groups are set to benefit from (and in part 
pay for) the program as part of a wider social contract.
Where deprivation is widespread, households across the income distri-
bution face similar levels of need. Continuity in welfare distribution may 
contrast with sharp, somewhat arbitrary, measures of poverty or eligibility 
criteria. For example, in some middle-income countries people living on 
US$6 a day, or just above the poverty line, face a 40 percent probability of 

Strengthening social protection    |    109
falling back into poverty.7 Poverty is often dynamic: in Africa, a third of the 
population is persistently poor, while another third moves in and out of 
poverty.8 
These facts suggest the need for broader and more permanent coverage 
than most social assistance programs currently provide. Although more uni-
versal approaches are desirable, the specific shape of this social minimum 
faces technical, budgetary, and political challenges. Universal approaches 
typically reduce or eliminate hurdles around program fragmentation, eli-
gibility determination, and social tensions, but they require significant 
additional resources. Expanding social assistance should proceed at the 
same pace as the mobilization of required resources. The choice of larger or 
smaller tax transfer policies has distributional effects as well as diverse bases 
of political support. 
As part of the expansion options, a universal basic income (UBI) is being 
hotly debated. This tool enshrines the notion of building a guaranteed social 
minimum through a single program with three design features. First, the 
program is aimed at every individual, independent of income or employ-
ment status. Second, participants do not have to fulfill any conditions or 
reciprocal co-responsibilities. Third, assistance is provided in the form of 
cash instead of in-kind transfers and services (figure 6.2).

A UBI is not an alternative to health, education, or other social services. 
The program may supplement current social assistance programs and more 
likely replace some of the programs pursuing income support functions. It 
may be designed with different objectives in mind, from poverty reduction 
to ensuring a livable income. The discussion here focuses on poverty reduc-
tion. Although a UBI provides the entire population with the same level of 
benefits, the money may be recovered from the rich through, for example, 
a progressive income tax. 
In early 2018 India’s then chief economic adviser, Arvind Subramanian, 
predicted enthusiastically, “I can bet . . . within the next two years, at least 
one or two [Indian] states will implement UBI.”9 But little is known about 
how a UBI works in practice. Only one country, Mongolia, has had such an 
initiative covering the entire population. However, the program lasted only 
two years (2010–12) before being dismantled because of fiscal constraints 
(when mineral prices collapsed, so did the scheme). The Islamic Republic 
of Iran had a similar program for one year: in 2011 energy subsidies were 
replaced by cash transfers to 96 percent of the population.
Local variants of a UBI are in place in a range of resource dividend 
schemes. In the United States, the Alaska Permanent Fund is designed to 
redistribute oil revenues to all state residents. In 2016 the fund distributed 
about US$2,000 each to 660,000 Alaskans. Several small-scale schemes 
and experiments are under way or being explored in China, Kenya, the 
Netherlands, Scotland, and the United States. Although they are called UBI 
programs, they are in some instances versions of targeted programs.
The fiscal implications of a UBI could be significant. New analysis has 
estimated the costs of providing such a program in four European countries. 
UBI transfers were set equal to those of existing cash transfer programs.10 
According to the results, the additional cost of a UBI varies significantly— 
13.8 percent of GDP in Finland, 10.1 percent in France, 8.9 percent in the 
United Kingdom, and 3.3 percent in Italy. To cover the additional costs, 
two funding sources were identified: taxing UBI transfers alongside other 
incomes, and abolishing existing tax allowances. In Finland and Italy, these 
measures were more than adequate to cover the additional costs of a UBI. 
In France, those revenues almost offset the cost of such a program. In the 
United Kingdom, taxing cash benefits and eliminating tax allowances were 
not enough to cover the UBI.
Simulations from developing countries also point to significant addi-
tional spending for a UBI. In a handful of emerging economies, a UBI set 
at 25 percent of median income would cost about 3.8 percent of GDP.11 
By comparison, low- and middle-income countries spend, on average,  
1.5 percent of GDP on social assistance. In India, the government estimates 
that a quasi-UBI excluding the top 25 percent could be largely paid for by 
replacing existing schemes.12 Although those schemes account for about  
5 percent of GDP, the results of the simulation have been contested.13 
Elsewhere, other simulations are providing further evidence. The cost of a 
UBI for adults set at the average poverty gap level ranges from 9.6 percent 

Strengthening social protection    |    111
of GDP in low-income coun-
tries to 3.5 percent of GDP in 
upper-middle-income countries. 
If transfer amounts are lower—
for example, set at the average 
level of current benefits—the 
costs would fall considerably 
(but would have less impact). 
Whether a UBI provides suffi-
cient funds to close the poverty 
gap or equates to current trans-
fer levels, the cost of the scheme 
would nearly double if intended 
for an entire population instead 
of for adults only (figure 6.3).
A UBI would generate winners 
and losers among the population. 
Its effects would depend on how 
the program is financed; whether 
existing targeted programs would 
be replaced and which ones; the performance of existing schemes; current 
tax structures; the size of UBI transfers; and the profile of people receiving it.
Estimates for a selection of developing countries that simulate replacing 
some existing schemes with a UBI found significant distributional effects. 
In Nepal, most people would gain from such a program. In Indonesia, a 
UBI providing the same average amount of benefits as current programs 
would make most of the population better off, but about 40 percent of the 
poor would receive less. Under the same scenario, simulations suggest that 
a UBI in South Africa would make most of the elderly and the poor worse 
off. A similar negative effect on about 40 percent of senior citizens would be 
observed in Chile. 
A recurring concern around the UBI is the risk of work disincentives. In 
theory, a UBI has only an income effect: the fact that the program’s ben-
efits are delinked from earnings or other income may suggest there is no 
substitution effect. However, the available evidence confirms that both a 
UBI and other forms of social assistance have a limited impact on work 
incentives. A study of the Alaskan dividend program shows no impact on 
employment. Instead, it finds that part-time employment increases by 1.8 
percentage points (equivalent to a 17 percent increase in employment).14 
A study of the Iranian quasi-UBI program found that it did not affect the 
overall labor supply.15 
An important debate is whether a program that guarantees jobs would 
serve as a better alternative to a UBI. India’s National Rural Employment 
Guarantee Act offers 100 days of work every year at the minimum wage. 
UBI proponents contest such a public works approach by asserting that the 
right to income should precede the right to work. Conversely, it is contended

that the right to work rests on the premise that anyone who wants work 
could be offered a job, thereby conferring on work a societal value. Those 
favoring job schemes also point to the range of productive and socially valu-
able activities that could be implemented beyond labor-intensive tasks such 
as social care services. A UBI may be an alternative to public works when 
their overwhelming function is mere income support. However, when more 
meaningful activity is envisioned, public works emerge as a complementary 
instrument for those who are fit and able to work. The concept of “partici­
pation income” is a hybrid between a UBI and public works. It envisions 
providing universal cash transfers tied to some form of civil engagement.
A UBI could generate more efficiency by reducing program fragmentation. 
Most countries operate a complex mosaic of social assistance programs—
Bangladesh has more than 100 programs, and India has nearly 950 centrally 
sponsored schemes, with many more provided at the state level. This pleth-
ora of programs usually has more historical or institutional roots than solid 
technical justification. Some degree of consolidation may be appropriate, but 
the optimal number of programs is certainly more than one.
Whichever form of social assistance is selected, technology can be har-
nessed to improve the delivery of social protection programs. In Mexico, 
geospatial mapping tools are used to identify the most vulnerable areas in 
cities, down to the block level. Mobile phone data were leveraged to con-
struct poverty maps in Côte d’Ivoire. In Benin, GPS-based data collection 
located households lacking addresses in urban settlements. Digital tech-
nologies can also deliver assistance in fragile places. In Lebanon, electronic 
smartcards provide 125,000 Syrian refugee households with food vouchers.
Technology is improving the credibility of personal identification systems, 
which are the first step in the delivery of social protection. In Sub-Saharan 
Africa, the share of the population with national identifications ranges from 
nearly 90 percent in Rwanda to less than 10 percent in Nigeria. Technology 
is also improving access to social registries, which in turn improves coordi-
nation among different programs. Better coordination generates cost savings 
by reducing inclusion errors. In Pakistan, the social registry, which includes 
85 percent of the population and serves 70 different programs, contributed 
to savings of US$248 million. A similar process saved US$157 million in 
South Africa and US$13 million in Guinea. In Argentina, linking 34 social 
program databases to the unique identification number of beneficiaries 
revealed inclusion errors in eligibility for various social programs, resulting 
in US$143 million in savings over an eight-year period. In 2016 Thailand 
eliminated 660,000 applicants out of 8.4 million by cross-checking databases 
using unique national identification numbers. 
Payment technologies make a difference. In Ghana’s Labor Intensive Pub-
lic Works scheme, the digitization of paper-based transactions and a wider 
use of biometric machines reduced overall wage payment time from four 
months to a week. In the Indian state of Chhattisgarh, the use of electronic 
devices by the Public Distribution System for food assistance contributed to 
a reduction in “leakages” from 52 percent in 2005 to 9 percent in 2012.16

Social insurance
In June 2011, after six years of double-digit growth, Ethiopia introduced 
a landmark social insurance law. For the first time, the mandate to pro-
vide pension and disability benefits was extended to private sector firms. 
(However, firms operating beyond the reach of enforcement could evade 
the law and keep their workers uncovered.) The policy sought to expand 
social protection and reduce poverty. However, the consequent rise in labor 
costs, together with other factors, induced firms to adopt more technology. 
As a result, employment among lower-skill workers dropped, exacerbating 
the formal-informal divide in the labor market.
The Bismarckian social insurance model of earnings-based contributions 
is premised on steady wage employment, clear definitions of employers and 
employees, and a fixed point of retirement. It relies on levying a dedicated 
tax on wages. In rich countries, this scheme was effective in increasing cov-
erage as workers were steadily absorbed into factories, then into jobs in 
formal services firms. But this contributory approach is not a good fit for 
developing countries, where formal and stable employment are not com-
mon. Indeed, because eligibility is based on making mandatory contribu-
tions, this form of social insurance excludes informal workers, who account 
for more than two-thirds of the workforce in developing countries and  
1 in 10 in India and many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (figure 6.4). This 
model is also increasingly unsuitable for the changing nature of work in 
which traditional employer-employee relationships are no longer the norm. 
The traditional financing model of social insurance often makes employing 
workers more expensive, as illustrated by Ethiopia’s experience, described 
above. Rethinking this model is a priority.

A reformed system must ensure that low-income workers have access to 
effective risk management tools. The right combination of instruments, sub-
sidized for the poorest, is required to cover losses from livelihood disruptions, 
sickness, disability, and untimely death. Instruments that support stable con-
sumption patterns, or are consumption smoothing, are also important. A 
comprehensive package of protection in pursuit of these goals would contain, 
first, a guaranteed minimum insurance with subsidized coverage against 
impoverishing losses. This instrument would complement social assistance 
by providing coverage against losses that would be too large to cover through 
transfers. Second, a mandated savings and insurance plan would allow for 
consumption smoothing. Finally, market-based “nudged” or purely volun-
tary savings would allow people to contribute more, if desired. Elements of 
this model already exist in many countries. 
This approach can, along with a guaranteed minimum income, reduce the 
size and pure-tax element of mandated contributions. To varying degrees, 
current social insurance models mingle redistribution with risk-sharing 
functions and require higher contributions that are perceived by many as 
taxes on work. The extent of redistribution built into current social insur-
ance schemes is low in countries such as Indonesia and Vietnam, but it is 
substantial in countries such as China and the Philippines. Simulations sug-
gest that a shift like the one proposed here could reduce the payroll tax rate 
in a country such as the Philippines from 18 to 14 percent.
Some countries are already moving in this direction. The significant 
extension of the rural pension scheme in China is one example. Currently, 
around 360 million rural and urban informal workers are contributing 
to the scheme. Some 150 million older people are receiving payments.17 
Similarly, Costa Rica’s government covers part of the pension contribution 
for the self-employed. Thailand does the same for informal sector workers 
who choose to join a special pension scheme aimed at low-income workers. 
Subsidies could be offered to everyone or just to the poor, or they could 
be gradually reduced as income grows. Turkey’s health insurance system 
does the latter. In addition to providing an almost universal old-age pension, 
Thailand pays part of the social insurance premium for working-age people 
in the informal sector. The cost of the subsidy depends on the subsidy level 
as well as the size of the population to be subsidized.
In many emerging economies, social insurance liabilities are limited 
because coverage is low. In countries such as Bangladesh, the Lao People’s 
Democratic Republic, Namibia, Somalia, and South Africa, pensions are not 
financed by labor taxes but by general revenues. In these cases, decoupling 
from payroll taxes may be feasible. A significant portion could be replaced 
with other taxes while broadening the coverage beyond those in contracted 
and regulated standard employment relationships.
Beyond the basic insurance level, additional policy support is likely 
required to achieve adequate protection. Additional mandated contribu-
tions would allow consumption smoothing, but the instruments needed 
are often missing in countries with underdeveloped capital and insurance 
markets. This layer would cover formal workers. However, setting the level 

Strengthening social protection    |    115
of insurance is not trivial because a higher mandate leads to higher labor 
taxes. In some countries, these taxes are already high, which affects formal 
employment. The average payroll tax rate used to finance contributions is 
almost 23 percent in advanced economies.18 It is also more than 20 percent 
in countries such as China, the Arab Republic of Egypt, and Peru. The man-
date could be relaxed by reducing the tax rate or lowering the ceiling on 
earnings subject to mandatory savings.
To complement mandatory contributions, participation in savings or 
insurance schemes could be the default option. Some measures include 
adding an “opt-in” default on business registration and income tax returns. 
These measures would potentially lower transaction costs. Other approaches 
that rely on behavioral insights are also instructive in some cases. In Kenya, 
giving people a golden-colored coin with numbers for each week to keep 
track of their weekly deposits doubled their savings rate.19 Another form of 
nudging may include “commitment devices” through which, for example, 
people agree to incur a loss if they do not reach a savings goal. Technology 
vastly increases the possible nudges. Among other things, it facilitates the 
defaulting of rounding from mobile money or credit card transactions into 
savings. 
Larger national nudge efforts—regardless of the way people work—are 
also under way to augment savings and insurance efforts. The KiwiSaver 
program in New Zealand relies on automatic enrollment and offers a limited 
set of investment choices. The United Kingdom’s National Employment Sav-
ings Trust, or NEST, operates in a similar way. In both programs, although 
people are allowed to withdraw savings, incentives dissuade them from 
doing so. 
Labor regulation
In many developing countries, labor regulations were adopted at the time 
of colonialism. Through conquest, labor law was transplanted throughout 
Western Europe and the colonies in North and West Africa, Latin America, 
and parts of Asia. The repercussions from this movement are still being felt 
in the 21st century: civil law countries have significantly more stringent 
labor regulations than do common law countries, placing more restrictions 
on how employers and workers interact.20 
The more restrictive approach to labor regulation is a poor fit with many 
developing countries’ labor markets because it assumes a greater adminis-
trative capacity than most governments have. Designed with industrial-era 
economies in mind and at a time of weak social protection systems, labor 
regulations often fail to protect most workers when informality is the norm 
and work is often out of reach of the authorities. Regulations in most coun-
tries are written assuming that most working people are in stable, full-time 
wage employment. In many developing countries, these types of jobs are an 
exception, mostly found in the public sector or among high-skill workers.
Reforms would have to address three main challenges associated with 
labor market regulations. First, these regulations cover only formal workers 

116    |    WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2019
whose labor is observed by the state. Yet more than half of the global labor 
force is informal. Second, governments are trying to do too much with 
labor regulations, expecting them to act as a substitute for social protection, 
including ensuring a minimum income or substituting for unemployment 
benefits. And, third, as argued in the World Development Report 2013: Jobs, 
while regulations address labor market imperfections, they often reduce 
dynamism in the economy by affecting labor market flows and increasing 
the length of time spent in both employment and unemployment. When 
regulations are too strict and exclude many workers, especially young and 
low-skill people, firms find it difficult to adjust the composition of their 
workforces. The ability to adjust is an important condition for adopting new 
technologies and increasing productivity.21 
In a sample of 60 countries, moving from the 20th to the 80th percentile 
in job security (in countries with strong rule of law) cuts the speed of adjust-
ment to shocks in employment by a third and reduces annual productivity 
growth by 1 percentage point.22 The adoption of productivity-enhancing 
technology is negatively associated with the strictness of some labor regula-
tions, specifically those with burdensome dismissal procedures.23 Thus the 
technology-intensive sectors are smaller in countries with stricter employ-
ment protection regulations.24 More stringent regulations are also associated 
with lower entry and exit of firms—especially small firms—in industries 
in which labor moves more frequently between jobs.25 Within countries, 
similar evidence is also emerging.26 
To address this challenge, policy makers would have to rethink labor reg-
ulations. Some countries are reforming theirs in ways that support firms and 
workers in adapting to the changing nature of work. Italy’s recent reforms 
have been associated with the creation of more permanent jobs.27 Aiming 
for a balance of security and flexibility is vital. Many governments have 
made their labor markets more flexible. However, only a few are making 
corresponding investments in income support and reemployment assistance 
to get workers back into work. Increasing flexibility for firms goes hand in 
hand with stronger social protection, intermediation and job search assis-
tance programs, and arrangements for strengthening the voice of workers. 
Beyond basic regulations, protections would be provided to all working 
people no matter how they engage in the labor market as part of a compre-
hensive approach to social protection and labor institutions. This approach 
would provide additional protection to the many workers—often the most 
vulnerable—who are effectively excluded. This would be a shift away from 
protecting some jobs to protecting all people. 
Reasonable notice periods and protections against discriminatory dismiss-
als are important to counter employer market power. However, when the 
rules applied to firms’ hiring and dismissal decisions are too onerous, they 
create structural rigidities that carry higher social costs in the face of disrup-
tion. Bolivia, Oman, and República Bolivariana de Venezuela do not allow 
contract termination for economic reasons; they limit grounds for dismissal 

Strengthening social protection    |    117
to disciplinary and personal matters. In 32 countries, an employer needs the 
approval of a third party even for individual redundancies. In Indonesia, 
approval from the Industrial Relations Dispute Settlement Board is required 
for dismissal. In Mexico, an employer must obtain approval from the Con-
ciliation and Arbitration Labor Board. And in Sri Lanka, an employer must 
obtain the consent of the employee or approval of the commissioner of labor. 
Firms could be given more flexibility in managing their human resources 
contingent on the law mandating proper notice, the presence of an adequate 
system of income protection, and efficient mechanisms to punish discrimina-
tion. However, more flexible dismissal procedures should be balanced with 
increased protections outside of the work contract and active reemployment 
support measures to protect people who lose their jobs. Otherwise, reducing 
restrictions on hiring and dismissal decisions would shift an unmanageable 
risk burden onto workers. The current approach in many countries, how-
ever, places too much of this burden on firms and not enough directly on 
the state. To reduce the risk of abuse by firms, governments could audit 
firms based on the associated risk that they will violate the law and then 
apply penalties to those found at fault.
The provision of financial protection to workers whose livelihood has 
been disrupted is also ripe for reconsideration. Severance pay is the most 
prevalent form of this protection in most low- and middle-income econ-
omies. However, it is a practice left over from a time when governments 
were unable to offer unemployment income support. Some countries have, 
on paper, extremely generous severance pay policies. The statutory sever-
ance pay after 10 years of continuous employment is 132 weeks of salary  
in Sierra Leone, 130 weeks of salary in Mauritius, and 120 weeks of salary 
in Bahrain. 
Yet severance pay is an ineffective instrument for income protection 
because it pools risk at the firm or industry level, where shocks and losses 
are correlated. Employees also face a high risk of not receiving payments 
if their employers have liquidity constraints or go out of business. Placing 
greater reliance on unemployment benefits organized nationally would 
give workers more reliable options. National instead of firm-based arrange-
ments would also open this form of protection to all, no matter where or 
how they work. 
To ensure sufficient protection while preserving work incentives, unem-
ployment benefit systems could rely on both individual savings and redistri-
bution. Savings could be drawn on for unemployment or for retraining. If 
people do not draw down all their savings, the remainder would be available 
upon retirement. Workers without enough savings would be able to rely on 
the minimum income guarantee financed through general revenues. Chile 
and Jordan have individual savings accounts for unemployment. Singapore 
has individual accounts for housing or education. 
Scrutiny of industrial-era employment protections should be accompanied 
by an assessment of rigid, possibly outdated, laws on work arrangements. 

118    |    WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2019
Some new forms of work blur the distinction between being an employee 
and being a “dependent” self-employed—for example, is a Yandex.Taxi 
driver in Moscow a Yandex.Taxi employee? To ensure the basic set of pro-
tections just discussed, labor codes should define more clearly what it means 
to be an employee in current labor markets. This definition would be based, 
for example, on the extent to which workers determine their working con-
ditions (such as when to work). It is important to ensure convergence in 
the types of benefits and protections that workers receive, regardless of the 
length of time they spend with an employer.
Finally, strengthening the enforcement of labor laws and mechanisms to 
expand workers’ voices is a worthy goal as well. Moving to a simpler core 
contract would require stronger collective bargaining structures as fewer 
protections are prespecified in the law. However, the significance of such 
structures is declining: across high-income countries the share of work-
ers covered by a collective agreement fell, on average, from 37 percent in 
2000 to 32 percent in 2015. Also in 2015, 24 percent of employees were 
members of trade unions, down from 30 percent in 1985. In developing 
countries, where there is high informality, unions and collective bargaining 
tend to play a limited role (figure 6.5). Unionization rates vary between 
15 and 20 percent of workers in Brazil, Moldova, Senegal, and Tunisia to 
less than 10 percent of workers in countries such as Ethiopia, Guatemala, 
Indonesia, and Turkey.

Digital technologies are also useful in the enforcement of labor laws and 
mechanisms to strengthen the voice of workers. They bring down enforce-
ment costs by more cheaply monitoring compliance with laws. In Brazil, the 
Annual Social Information Report is used to monitor compliance with the 
Apprentice Law. Oman’s Worker Protection Scheme allows monitoring of 
wage payments. And social media plays a role in voicing complaints about 
employers and working conditions, putting pressure not only on authorities 
but also on employers because of reputational risks. 
To deal with the risks associated with current and future labor markets, 
governments have to rethink social protection systems. Social assistance 
should be enhanced, including through a guaranteed social minimum. 
Potentially, this minimum could be universal, based on countries’ conditions 
and preferences. The notion of progressive universalism may guide any such 
expansion from the bottom up. Social insurance will play a vital role. Yet 
the typical Bismarckian model is withering or remains aspirational for many 
countries, especially because of pervasive informality. As more investments 
are made in social protection, a balanced approach to labor market regula-
tions could meet productivity and equity goals more effectively.

CHAPTER 7
Ideas for social inclusion

A 
social contract envisions the state’s obligations to its citizens and 
what the state expects in return. This basic concept has evolved 
over time. For much of history, social contracts have been imposed 
by force or the threat of it. Nowadays, the sustainability of social 
contracts hinges on how fair they are perceived to be. In his 1762 book  
On the Social Contract; or, Principles of Political Rights, French philosopher Jean-
Jacques Rousseau posits that everyone will be free because all forfeit the 
same number of rights and are subjected to the same duties. This is the view 
this chapter takes of the social contract: as a policy package that aims to 
contribute to a fairer society.
Old and new pressures on social contracts are raising calls for new ideas. 
Cracks in the current social contracts are evident in the lack of efficient pub-
lic services for most of the poor. Meanwhile, the changing nature of work 
is generating fears about mass unemployment. These trends are straining 
the relationships among citizens, firms, and governments across the globe. 
Although some of these fears appear to be exaggerated, there are indeed 
reasons to be concerned.
Technological developments in the digital era merit the injection of new 
ideas into public debates about social inclusion—defined as improving the 
ability, opportunity, and dignity of those most disadvantaged in society. Two 
elements deserve special attention. First, using technology, governments 
have new ways to reach the poor as well as others who lack access to quality 
services or tools to manage risks. Many work informally in low-productivity 
jobs without access to protections, making it difficult to escape or remain out 
of poverty. Informality limits the reach of social insurance systems that are 
based on formal earnings contributions declared to the state.
Second, the changing nature of work implies adjustment costs for work-
ers. Technology has varying impacts on skills and the demand for them 
in the labor market. Depending on the technology, some skills (and the 
workers who possess them) are becoming more relevant than others in 
the world of work. Advanced skills—such as complex problem-solving and 
critical thinking—are becoming more valued in labor markets. People with 
these skills can work more effectively with new technologies. Sociobehav-
ioral skills—such as empathy, teamwork, and conflict resolution—are also 
becoming more valuable in labor markets because they cannot be easily 
replicated by machines.
This is the right time to think about how to improve social inclusion. The 
politics of some of the reforms are complex because of the potential trade-
offs between, for example, investments in the current generation of workers 
versus those in future generations. Public spending has to become more 
efficient, and additional sources of revenue have to be identified to enhance 
social inclusion. Aspirations, especially among the youth, are rising, in part 
due to social media and urbanization. When aspirations are met, they foster 
opportunity and prosperity. But when aspirations are unfulfilled, they can 
lead to frustration, or even unrest, in some countries.

Ideas for social inclusion    |    125
This chapter addresses three questions. First, how can society frame a 
new social contract in the context of high informality and the changing 
nature of work? Second, if a government is given a mandate to prepare 
a social contract aimed at improving fairness in society, what would be 
its basic ingredients? And, third, how can the state finance any proposed 
reforms? This exercise sets out a scenario for politicians to consider as part 
of legislative processes and national consultations.
A global “New Deal”
“There is a culture of not participating, of not caring, of silence. The social 
contract is broken,” said a resident in 2017 of one of the areas affected by 
insecurity in Mexico.1 Cracks in the current social contracts were already 
evident in the events surrounding the Arab Spring of 2010–12 and the back-
lash against globalization that is reflected in rising protectionism. In many 
developing countries, a dysfunctional social contract may lead citizens to 
make fewer demands on the state to improve public services. Indeed, some 
observers have suggested that in developing countries the middle class “send 
their children to private schools, use private healthcare, dig their own bore-
holes for water and buy their own generators.”2
Mechanisms to ensure equal opportunity, which in turn ensures social 
inclusion, often fall short. Countries are neglecting investments in the early 
years of children’s lives, particularly children in disadvantaged groups. In 
Latin America, overall per capita government spending on children under 
age 5 is a third that for children between the ages of 6 and 11. In Sub- 
Saharan Africa, only 2 percent of countries’ education budgets, on average, 
goes to preprimary education.3 Tax and social protection systems in develop-
ing countries redistribute income to a limited extent. In some countries, this 
is because taxation lacks progressivity; in many others it is simply because 
the revenue collected is too low. 
Persistently high levels of informality are a symptom of the erosion of 
social contracts. Informal employment exceeds 70 percent in Sub-Saharan 
Africa and 60 percent in South Asia. In Latin America, it is more than 50 
percent. Informal workers are beyond the reach of the state with respect to 
the provision of social services, robust social protection, and redistributive 
measures. People operating in the informal economy evade their obligations 
to the state by not paying taxes. In some ways, informality reflects a lack of 
trust in the state.4
Recent examples of substantially new social contracts and their elements 
include Denmark’s adoption of “flexicurity,” which has its roots in the 19th 
century. These new social contracts combine labor market flexibility with 
strong social security and active labor market programs. Other examples 
include the economic reforms introducing market principles that began 
in 1978 in China, the Balcerowicz Plan in Poland in 1989, and the Hartz 
reforms in Germany in 2003. Arguably, however, when people think about 

126    |    WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2019
social contracts that involve significant reforms associated with the nature of 
work, the New Deal under U.S. president Franklin D. Roosevelt is a common 
yardstick for ambition. The reference evokes the possibility of subsidizing 
employment (or taxing robots) in response to technological progress. The 
allusion, however, is disingenuous.
During the Great Depression of 1929–33, the U.S. unemployment rate 
rocketed from 3 percent to 25 percent. Industrial output halved. Responding 
to the dismal state of the economy, in 1932 Franklin Roosevelt pledged “a 
new deal for the American people” as he accepted his party’s presidential 
nomination. His New Deal eventually encompassed the various programs 
and reforms his administration put in place from 1933 to 1938 to lift the 
United States out of the Depression. 
The New Deal, albeit bold and comprehensive, was a response to a prob-
lem that is different from that faced in 2018 in the context of informality in 
developing countries or the changing nature of work globally. Most notably, 
although the Depression was largely a transitory shock to the U.S. econ-
omy, changes to the nature of work and persistent informality are anything 
but transitory. Some of the measures included in the New Deal—such as 
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Supplemental Nutri-
tion Assistance Program—addressed not only the temporary shock of the 
Depression but also the permanent need for protections beyond the crisis. 
However, the largest programs, especially those subsidizing employment or 
earnings, were temporary—which was appropriate for the circumstances. 
Public works activities may go beyond infrastructure. Currently, some 
essential social activities are being provided voluntarily by individuals. Infor-
mal care, or caregiving for a household member with severe disabilities or 
long-term illness, is widespread. According to recent estimates, more than  
2 million people in the United Kingdom are receiving informal care. Women 
are more likely than men to experience an unexpected move into providing 
such care. As a result, they face difficulties in balancing their caregiving role 
with their engagement in the labor market. In addition to lost income, such 
arrangements can have negative sociobehavioral impacts on the well-being 
of informal providers.
Effective social care entails reimagining a role for the state in reducing 
involuntary unemployment by providing services in several areas. These 
include child care, disability and old-age care, psychological support for 
the long-term unemployed, support for social kitchens, and rehabilitation 
from drugs and violence. Interventions such as Kinofelis in Greece and the 
Expanded Public Works Programme in South Africa are activities of this 
nature.
An area for enhanced public service provision is community-based pri-
mary health care, which extends preventive and curative health services 
beyond health facilities into communities and households. A review of 
empirical studies reveals that this approach is effective in enhancing nutri-
tion and immunization, controlling pneumonia and other diseases such as 

Ideas for social inclusion    |    127
malaria, as well as preventing and treating the human immunodeficiency 
virus. Equipped with less comprehensive training than professional health 
workers, community health workers provide basic medical care, have solid 
referral capabilities, and develop trust in the communities they serve.
Creating a new social contract
Equality of opportunity plays a big role in the changing nature of work. 
Investing in early childhood development can foster opportunity. One esti-
mate suggests that expansion of early childhood development policies in 
the United States could reduce inequality by 7 percent and increase inter-
generational income mobility by 30 percent.5 Equality of opportunity also 
means boosting social protections, including social assistance and insurance, 
in ways that are compatible with work. These elements of the social con-
tract echo the three freedoms featured by Nobel Prize winner Amartya Sen 
in Development as Freedom: political freedoms and transparency in relations 
between people, freedom of opportunity, and economic protection from 
abject poverty.6
Beyond some core elements, any new social contract would have to be 
tailored to its particular country context. One clear area of customization is 
related to demographic trends. By 2050, more than half of global population 
growth will have occurred in Sub-Saharan Africa, where the annual growth 
rates of the working-age population are projected to exceed 2.7 percent.7 By 
contrast, the populations of East Asia and the Pacific are aging: more than 
211 million people over the age of 65 live in this region, accounting for 36 
percent of the global population in this age group. By 2040, the working-age 
population will have shrunk by 10–15 percent in China, the Republic of 
Korea, and Thailand.8 Countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia 
would therefore have to be especially responsive to the needs of the large 
youth cohorts entering the labor market to ensure the sustainability of the 
social contract. Social contracts in Eastern Europe and East Asia would also 
need to create mechanisms to finance the protection and care of the elderly 
in a sustainable manner. 
A society with equality of opportunity is often defined as a society that 
manages to give all its members an equal chance to attain economic and 
social well-being. However, this happens only if all members of society have 
access to some guaranteed social minimum, including health care, educa-
tion, and social protection. Such a minimum would provide basic human 
capital to everyone, placing them on an equal footing to pursue their goals.
The labor market is increasingly valuing advanced cognitive and socio­
behavioral skills that complement technology and make workers more 
adaptable. This means that inequality will increase unless everyone has a 
fair shot at acquiring these skills. In fact, in view of the changing nature 
of work, lack of education is likely to be one of the strongest mechanisms 
for transmitting inequalities from one generation to the next. A new social 

128    |    WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2019
contract should seek to level the playing field for acquiring skills. The most 
direct way to provide fairness is to support early childhood development. 
Guaranteeing that every child has access to adequate nutrition, health, edu-
cation, and protection, particularly in the earliest years of life, ensures a 
solid foundation for developing skills in the future. Because the acquisition 
of skills is cumulative, the returns to early investments are the highest.
The changing nature of work is turning basic literacy and numeracy into 
survival skills. They are required to simply navigate life—to buy medication, 
apply for jobs, and interpret campaign promises. The ability to read and 
manipulate numbers also serves as a prerequisite for acquiring advanced 
skills. But for too many children, schooling does not translate into learning. 
Millions of children in low- and middle-income countries attend school for 
four or five years without acquiring basic literacy and numeracy. Conse-
quently, guaranteeing access to basic education is not enough. 
A social contract for early childhood development would ideally have three 
components. The first component ensures that children have the essential 
inputs so they are healthy, well-nourished, and stimulated during their first 
thousand days (from conception to 24 months of age). This means maternal 
access to prenatal health care, immunizations, and micronutrients and infor-
mation for parents on the importance of breastfeeding and early stimula-
tion. The second component ensures access to quality early learning during 
a child’s next thousand days (from 25 to 60 months of age). This means at 
least one year of quality preschool so that a child is ready for primary school. 
Preprimary programs should have age-appropriate curricula and qualified 
teachers. The third component is birth registration, whereby children are 
recognized by the state and are equipped with the ability to access essential 
services throughout their lives. Together, all these components—prenatal 
health care, birth assistance, immunizations, micronutrients, information 
for parents, quality preschool, and birth registration—make up a basic pack-
age that addresses children’s early development and learning needs. A more 
comprehensive package would include investments in safe water and ade-
quate sanitation. Investments to improve air quality are also increasingly 
important, and research into cost-effective programs is under way.
Some countries are already trying to deliver this type of social contract. In 
Cuba’s early childhood development program, children’s growth and devel-
opment are regularly monitored. At the beginning of each school year, the 
education sector identifies families who need specific attention. The Chile 
Crece Contigo program includes a programa de acompañamiento familiar, 
which works with families, pregnant women, and children under grade four 
who are at social and health risk. Peru has simplified the birth registration 
process for easier access to early childhood development services. It supports 
parents in monitoring children’s growth and health and engaging in early 
stimulation activities. France passed a law in 2018 to ensure that all children 
have access to preschool, starting at age 3.
A social contract on literacy and numeracy would ensure that students 
master these skills by grade three (approximately by age 10). By this grade, 
students should be able to read to access the school curriculum. Children 

Ideas for social inclusion    |    129
who cannot read by grade three struggle to catch up, eventually falling 
so far behind that no learning occurs at all. The core ingredients of this 
element would include learning assessments at the end of grade three to 
identify children at risk, and reading and math assistance for students in 
grades one to three who need additional support. A more comprehensive 
package would include ensuring a pupil-teacher ratio of no more than 40:1 
in primary grades and providing adequate learning materials with a target of 
one pupil per textbook in those grades.
Good models for supporting literacy and numeracy by grade three are 
available, and they are both cost-effective and scalable, even where resources 
are limited. In Liberia and Malawi, training teachers to better evaluate their 
students combined with additional materials significantly improved learning 
in early grades. In Singapore, all students are screened at the onset of grade 
one. Children who do not attain the appropriate early literacy skills are sup-
ported through the Learning Support Programme. These are straightforward 
approaches. They train teachers to assess their students through ongoing, 
simple measurements of their abilities to read, write, comprehend, and do 
basic arithmetic. Children who need additional support receive targeted 
materials and undertake targeted activities. These models have been tested 
with success in Ghana, India, Jordan, and Kenya. They serve as a basis for 
precise design and budget estimates. 
The new social contract would also include elements of social protec-
tion. The increased risks encountered in the changing nature of work call 
for adjustments to worker protection. A new social contract could provide 
a minimum income, combined with basic universal social insurance, that 
is decoupled from how or where people work. A guaranteed social min-
imum could take many forms, achieved through a series of programs or 
by expanding individual interventions. Each of these modalities presents 
different comparative advantages and has fiscal, political, and administrative 
implications.
Low- and middle-income countries have made significant headway 
in social assistance. In Tanzania, spending on conditional cash transfers 
increased tenfold between 2013 and 2016. The program currently reaches 
16 percent of the population and claims 0.3 percent of the gross domestic 
product (GDP). Spending on conditional cash transfers in the Philippines 
grew fivefold over 2009–15: the Pantawid program covers 20 percent of the 
population at a cost of 0.5 percent of GDP. These trends mirror the growth in 
categorical or age-based programs such as the Child Support Grant in South 
Africa. The scheme’s coverage increased from 1 million beneficiaries in 2001 
to 11 million in 2014, absorbing 0.2 and 1.2 percent of GDP, respectively.
Current experiences offer a wide range of tested programs that could 
be expanded. Whether old or new, programs should share the notion of 
progressive universalism. This principle deliberately aims at higher levels  
of coverage, while ensuring that the poor would benefit more and before 
others. Where exactly in the income distribution one becomes a net ben-
eficiary instead of a net payer is a choice that countries and governments 
would make themselves.

130    |    WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2019
Social insurance systems that cover old-age and disability pensions are 
based on a standard employer-employee relationship with limited suitability 
for developing countries. New forms of work are increasingly challenging 
this model in advanced economies as well, and, as a result, informal workers 
often lack access to this kind of support. The system is financed by labor taxes 
that raise the costs of hiring workers. As social contracts are reimagined, 
subsidizing a basic level of social insurance—especially for the poor—could 
be considered. Such a reform could also equalize the costs borne by different 
factors of production, such as capital and labor, as the financing of the system 
is at least partly shifted away from labor taxes toward general taxation.
Providing economic opportunities for young adults must be part of social 
contracts. But the pace of job creation for new labor market entrants has 
often been slow. For many young people, persistent gaps in access to ade-
quate skills are barriers to employment. International experience with the 
“productive inclusion” of poor and vulnerable young people reveals that 
a wide array of programs is available to connect them to wage employ-
ment and self-employment. Interventions may include wage subsidies, 
public works schemes, entrepreneurship grants and asset transfers (often 
part of “graduation” models), coaching, apprenticeships, internships, and 
various forms of training. Empirical evidence finds that these programs have 
mixed effects, with profiling, design, and their particular contexts shaping 
their cost-effectiveness. For example, wage subsidies may be appropriate 
in peri-urban contexts with large industrial parks, whereas graduation 
schemes are largely devised for rural populations (including the transfer of 
assets such as livestock).
Financing social inclusion
Social inclusion is costly. Simulations suggest that the components of build-
ing human capital, including early childhood development and support 
for literacy and numeracy by grade three, would cost around 2.7 percent 
of GDP in low-income countries and 1.2 percent of GDP in lower-middle- 
income countries. The cost of a more comprehensive human capital package 
is estimated at 11.5 percent of GDP in low-income countries and 2.3 per-
cent of GDP in lower-middle-income countries. These estimates are based 
on a fully costed model in developing countries, combined with data-driven 
assumptions. They are the costs of delivering the human capital package, 
irrespective of income level or coverage of existing programs. 
The actual costs could be lower for countries that choose to build on 
existing programs. Figure 7.1 shows estimates for three scenarios: a low- 
income country (Mali), a lower-middle-income country (Indonesia), and an 
upper-middle-income country (Colombia).
How much it costs to provide a guaranteed social minimum would vary 
according to the context and design choices. A basic social assistance pack-
age would cost 9.6 percent of GDP in low-income countries, 5.1 percent in 
lower-middle-income countries, and 3.5 percent in upper-middle-income 
countries. These estimates use a universal basic income (UBI), set at the 
average poverty gap level and aimed at adults. A more ambitious package, 

Ideas for social inclusion    |    131
illustrated by a UBI that reaches everyone, including children, would cost  
9 percent of GDP in lower-middle-income countries and 5.2 percent of GDP 
in upper-middle-income countries. In the poorest countries, the cost of this 
package would be in the double digits.9 
For the 1 billion young adults (20–29 years of age) worldwide, the average 
intervention costs, depending on the contents of the human capital package, 
would range from US$831 to US$1,079 per participant.10 The total cost for 
reaching vulnerable young adults, or 12.8 percent of the age cohort,11 would 
amount to between 2.9 and 3.8 percent of average GDP in low-income 
countries, from 0.9 to 1.1 percent in lower-middle-income countries, and 
from 0.2 to 0.3 percent in upper-middle-income countries.
A new social contract would therefore require a significant mobilization of 
revenue by most governments worldwide. Current taxation patterns reveal 
FIGURE 7.1 Low-income countries would pay more than lower-middle-
income and upper-middle-income countries for selected elements of a 
renewed social contract

Note: The basic human capital package includes (1) supporting early childhood development, including prenatal health 
care, birth assistance, immunizations, micronutrients, parental outreach, birth registration, and at least one year of quality 
preschool for every child; (2) implementing learning assessments at the end of grade three to shine a light on those who 
are at risk; and (3) offering reading and math assistance for students in grades one to three who need additional support. 
The more comprehensive human capital package includes, in addition to the basic package, the following elements:  
(1) access to safe water and adequate sanitation; (2) a pupil-teacher ratio of no more than 40:1 in primary grades; and 
(3) one pupil per textbook in primary grades. Element-specific unit costs are derived from rigorous studies of relevant 
in-country programs where available. Alternatively, the most recent cost estimates appropriate for the country’s income 
level are considered. Beneficiary calculations are based on population data from United Nations’ World Population Pros-
pects. Other country-level data such as gross domestic product (GDP), access to safe water and sanitation, and prevailing 
proficiency rates are derived from the World Bank’s World Development Indicators (database) and other studies. The 
basic social assistance package includes universal basic income (UBI) for adults set at the average poverty gap level. 
The more comprehensive social assistance package includes UBI for the full population set at the average poverty gap 
level. See chapter 6 for more details on UBI costing. Estimates are based on specific countries for each country group 
(low income, Mali; lower middle income, Indonesia; upper middle income, Colombia). As such, results are meant to be 
indicative. See note 11 in this chapter for the young adults estimates method.

large 
differences, 
especially 
between low-, middle-, and 
high-income countries. High- 
income countries collect a much 
larger share of their national out-
put in taxes—specifically, direct 
taxes—than do lower-income 
countries. Low- and middle- 
income countries, by contrast, 
rely more on indirect taxes such 
as consumption and trade taxes 
(figure 7.2). 
Additional revenue mobili-
zation is possible in most coun-
tries. Estimates suggest that Sub- 
Saharan African countries could 
raise between 3 and 5 percent 
of GDP in additional reve-
nue through a combination of 
reforms that improve efficiency, 
harness new technologies to 
improve compliance, and create 
new sources of taxation.12 
Governments can reduce tax 
policy and compliance gaps across 
a number of fiscal instruments (figure 7.3), including the value added tax, 
excise tax, and personal and corporate income and property taxes, as well as 
through fiscal regimes for extractive industries in resource-rich countries.
Often a first line of reform for developing countries, the value added tax 
is potentially a major source of revenue. But a few countries, such as the 
Maldives and Myanmar, do not have a value added tax. Many others, par-
ticularly in Sub-Saharan Africa, also continue to rely on sales taxes. These 
countries include Angola, Comoros, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, and São Tomé 
and Príncipe. Introducing a value added tax instead of general sales taxes 
avoids tax cascading (tax paid on tax) by taxing only the value added at each 
stage of the value chain. 
That said, even if a value added tax were in place in emerging economies, 
it may have only a limited impact on revenue generation. Poor fiscal capac-
ity often results in compliance problems related to flawed implementation. 
Raising the value added tax thresholds in countries that already have it, 
closing tax exemptions, and converging toward a uniform tax rate could 
raise significant revenue, in part by simplifying the system. South Africa and 
the Sub-Saharan Africa countries of Lesotho, Mauritius, and Senegal do not 
have many exemptions. By contrast, Cameroon, Malawi, and Zambia have 
extensive lists of exemptions. In Latin America, in Costa Rica, the Domini-

In Vietnam, moving to a uniform 
value added tax rate of 10 per-
cent and significantly narrow-
ing the list of exemptions could 
increase tax revenues by 11 per-
cent.14 Informal firms are more 
likely to pay the value added 
tax when it is combined with 
measures to promote payment 
such as inquiry services, targeted 
outreach, and incentives that 
reward compliance. Expanding 
coverage of the value added 
tax would also reduce the dis-
tortions created between those 
sectors of the economy that pay 
the tax and those that do not. 
Ultimately, such a step would 
enhance economic productivity 
and raise revenues further.
The value added tax is often 
considered regressive relative to 
income because the poor spend 
a larger share of their income on 
consumption than the rich. Even 
though consumption taxes are 
regressive when measured as a 
percentage of household income, 
they are either proportional or 
slightly progressive when mea-
sured as a percentage of house-
hold expenditure. Many coun-
tries exempt basic food products 
such as milk and bread and 
some medical products from the 
value added tax to ensure that 
poor people have access to them 
at lower costs. Simulations for four low- and middle-income countries— 
Ethiopia, Ghana, Senegal, and Zambia—show that, although preferential 
value added tax rates reduce poverty, they do not target poor households 
effectively. As a result, a UBI funded by 75 percent of the revenue gains from 
a broader value added tax base—despite being untargeted—could create 
large net gains for poor households.15
Excise taxes are another relatively accessible source of potential revenue. 
They are simple to implement and are compatible with most tax systems. In 
2015 Sub-Saharan African countries collected less than half (at 1.4 percent 
of GDP) of the excise taxes collected in Europe. There are wide differences

Tax and Development’s Government Revenue Data Set; Norre-
gaard (2013); IMF (2015).
Note: For the value added tax (VAT) and excise taxes, estimates 
are based on the difference between the average tax revenue 
collected as a percentage of the gross domestic product (GDP) 
for the top three countries in the income group and the average 
for all countries in the group. The VAT category includes the 
value added and sales taxes. For property taxes, the focus is 
on taxes on immovable property. Estimates for middle-income 
countries are from Norregaard (2013), who uses a methodology 
similar to the one followed here for the value added and excise 
taxes. For low-income countries, where no systematic data are 
available a conservative estimate of 0.5 percent of GDP is used 
to reflect the lower capacity of those countries to tax property 
because complete registries are rare. The potential tax revenue 
from improved compliance is drawn from IMF (2015), which 
reports potential gains of about 15 percent, or about 1 percent 
of GDP, from improved compliance with the value added tax in 
Latin America. This figure is used as the lower bound for poten-
tial gains from improving compliance in the whole tax system. 
For energy subsidies, estimates are based on the 2015 IMF data 
set of country-level estimates (IMF 2015). Unlike taxes, resources 
from eliminating energy subsidies would be available to only 
those countries that have such subsidies.

in excise tax collection across Sub-Saharan Africa, with several countries, 
including Benin, Côte d’Ivoire, Madagascar, Mozambique, Nigeria, and 
Sierra Leone, collecting excise revenues totaling less than 1 percent of GDP. 
Excise taxes are often used by governments to achieve social welfare or 
environmental sustainability objectives by adding in the social cost of nega-
tive externalities from the consumption of products such as alcohol, tobacco, 
and unhealthy foods and from pollution emissions. Some of these taxes are 
deemed regressive because the poorest families tend to allocate larger shares 
of their budget to them. This perception should be weighed against the  
longer-term benefits of these taxes such as lower medical expenses and  
longer, healthier working lives. 
Carbon taxes have become increasingly prevalent. Nationally efficient 
carbon pricing policies could raise substantial amounts of revenue—esti-
mated at more than 6 percent of GDP in China, the Islamic Republic of Iran, 
the Russian Federation, and Saudi Arabia.16 One study of the top 20 carbon 
dioxide–emitting countries found that, on average, potential revenues raised 
from nationally efficient carbon pricing would be almost 2 percent of GDP.17 
If revenues from such prices were used to reduce the burden of the broader 
tax system, the net benefits of carbon pricing could increase substantially. 
Carbon taxes are currently in place in nearly every large economy except 
Brazil and the United States, although the rates vary widely.18 Gradually 
increasing carbon prices could mitigate the short-term effects on the produc-
tive competitiveness of developing economies.
Carbon taxes could be paired with the elimination of energy subsidies for 
consumption. Globally, government spending on these subsidies amounts 
to US$333 billion. The fiscal gains from dismantling energy subsidies could 
be substantial: in many countries their overall level is higher than public 
spending on social assistance (countries on the right side of the 45° line in 
figure 7.4). Average spending on energy subsidies in the Middle East and 
North Africa region is three times higher than on social assistance. Never­
theless, the removal of energy subsidies must undergo a poverty impact 
analysis, especially for the fuel sources used most intensively by poor house-
holds, such as kerosene. 
In addition to taxes on goods and services, personal and corporate income 
taxes can play an important role in increasing revenues in developing coun-
tries. Just as technology improves delivery systems for social protection 
programs, it can facilitate income tax collection by increasing the number 
of registered taxpayers and social security contributions. The erosion of the 
corporate tax base affects many countries. It stems mostly from a combina-
tion of exemptions (tax incentives) and avoidance loopholes in the inter-
national corporate tax system. Higher effective corporate income tax could 
limit base erosion and profit shifting and address rising corporate market 
power. Effective tax rates could be increased by streamlining tax expendi-
tures and introducing robust anti–tax avoidance rules such as controlled 
foreign corporation regimes, limits on interest deductibility, and withhold-
ing taxes on payments for services. Withholding taxes are becoming more 
relevant with the increasing global presence of platform and other firms 
with a significant digital presence and relatively few tangible assets.

Another form of recurrent taxation that can be tapped for further 
resources in most developing countries is immovable property taxes. These 
taxes do not distort labor markets, human capital accumulation, or inno-
vation decisions. Property taxes also provide a stable source of revenue 
that is less susceptible to short-term economic fluctuations and is difficult 
to evade. And although property taxes would likely not flow into federal 
social protection schemes (they are typically raised by local governments), 
they could fund regional or municipal social services or reduce the level 
of federal transfers to local governments. On average, high-income coun-
tries raise 1.1 percent of GDP from immovable property taxes. In middle- 
income countries, these taxes yield about 0.4 percent of GDP.19 Yet property 
taxes represent untapped revenue potential for all countries. This revenue

gap is estimated to be 0.9 percent of GDP in middle-income countries and as 
much as 2.9 percent in high-income countries.20 Governments in Sub-Saha-
ran Africa are estimated to be missing out on revenues of 0.5 to 1 percent of 
GDP because of no property taxes whatsoever or their limited application. 
Although some countries apply property taxes broadly in the law, the taxes 
may generate limited revenues because of poor enforcement and informal-
ity. Securing broad compliance with property taxes is almost impossible in 
countries without clear property laws or land cadastres. Formally registered 
land constitutes less than 1 percent of total land in Cameroon and Rwanda. 
However, limited registration of land has not prevented the use of specific 
property taxes in most of Sub-Saharan Africa. For example, property taxes 
may be levied on leasehold rights, such as in Zambia, or other types of limited 
property rights, such as concessions in Cameroon and the Democratic Repub-
lic of Congo. But even where most property is subject to tax and captured in 
the register, tax rates may still be too low or the property valuation updated 
too infrequently to have a meaningful impact on revenues. Although prop-
erty taxes are becoming more common in Sub-Saharan Africa, some coun-
tries, including Botswana, eSwatini (formerly Swaziland), Lesotho, Malawi, 
and Zimbabwe, still rely on onetime payments. Some countries are taking 
steps to expand the tax base: Vietnam adopted a tax on nonagricultural land 
in 2010, and China is considering the imposition of a residential property tax. 
Technology can improve property tax collection by digitizing property 
registration systems. If accompanied by rigorous enforcement, the adoption 
of new technologies leads to a significant boost in revenues. In 2010 the  
rate of tax collection on urban immovable property in Lahore, Pakistan, 
was one of the lowest in the world—0.03 percent of the state’s GDP. The 
average for large cities in developing countries stands at 0.6 percent. The 
digitization of Lahore’s property records in 2012–13 led to the addition of 
1.7 million previously unregistered properties. As a result, municipal prop-
erty tax receipts increased by 102 percent. 
Finally, some resource-rich developing countries may be able to raise 
revenue by introducing or improving regimes applicable to extractive 
industries. Natural resource taxes and government royalties on oil, gas, and 
mining could make a substantial contribution to the revenue needs of many 
emerging economies. The impact of increased production on government 
revenues has been estimated at about 1 percent of 2011 GDP for Sub- 
Saharan Africa (assuming a 50 percent government share in rents). The 
revenue potential is even larger in other countries: 27 percent of GDP in 
Mozambique from gas exploration and 147 percent in Liberia from iron ore 
and petroleum exploration.21 
Preparing for and adapting to the changing nature of work require a 
strong social contract. While the precise components of such contracts may 
vary, it is important that they ensure the appropriate investments in edu-
cation and social protection. Yet sustaining renewed action in these sectors 
calls for substantial fiscal resources. A range of financing options is available 
to policy makers, the exploitation of which would require careful technical 
assessments, combined with political leadership at both the national and 
global levels.
