Preface
Everyone has an idea for a game. Coming up with ideas is easy. The hard part is 
turning that good idea into a working game that other people can actually play.
There are a million different ways to create a game, but some paths are easier 
than others. Far too many people get an idea and jump right into making their game 
right away. While this method can work, it’s more likely to lead to multiple dead 
ends and detours that can to frustration. The end result is often an unfinished game 
regardless of how good the original idea might have been.
Many people abandon their game ideas because of their lack of proper planning 
and structure. Making a game requires understanding what you can do, how you can 
do it, and what you want to accomplish. In other words, game design is both an art 
and a science.
By playing games, you can get an intuitive feel for what you like (and dislike) in 
games so you can develop your own style for designing them. By studying the com­
ponents of games and how they work, you can develop the knowledge and skills 
needed to turn any idea into a working game.
Too many people believe they can’t make a game. That’s not true. Even if you 
only possess a fraction of the skills necessary to make a game, you always have a 
choice. First, you can develop the skills needed to complete your game. This may not 
always be easy and will likely take more time than you want, but it’s always possible.
Second, you can cooperate with others who possess the necessary skills you need 
to complete your game. A person’s technical skills are actually far less important 
than their ability to get along with others. A handful of less talented and skilled 
people working together will get farther than a dream team of highly skilled and 
experienced people who can’t cooperate at all.
Whether you plan to develop your own game making skills, cooperate with oth­
ers, or do a combination of both, you can make a game. The purpose of this book, 
“The Structure of Game Design,” is to help both novice and experienced game 
designers understand the common components for creating games. By understand­
ing the mechanics behind how games work, you can pick and choose the best 
options for turning your own idea into a completed game.

vi
There is no right or wrong way to design a game as long as the end result creates 
a finished product. However, there are faster and slower, more frustrating ways to 
design a game. This book can provide guidelines to help you create games faster and 
more consistently by planning and designing ahead of time to maximize your 
chance of success.
With this book, you’ll have the knowledge you need to make a game. You just 
need to do the hard work of applying your skills and knowledge into making your 
game idea into reality.

helping me get a book contract through Springer.
Thanks also go to Dane Henderson at www.theredination.com, who has created 
numerous opportunities for me in the esports and gaming world. Dane’s invaluable 
network has put me in touch with more people than I could ever imagine.

of invaluable information about video games, their history, and the latest news and 
trends about different games and gaming studios.
Lastly, I’d like to thank my cats, Oscar and Mayer, who like walking across my 
keyboard and standing in front of my monitor so I can’t get any work done until I 
feed them, pet them, or let them outside.

Most everyone has played a game or watched other people play a game. However, 
not as many people have ever thought of creating their own game. This part of the 
book examines common elements found in nearly all games. The better you under­
stand what makes a game work, the easier it will be to design and make your 
own game.
People play games for a variety of reasons, but the essence of any game is posing 
a challenge to the players. That challenge can be mental (such as chess or poker), 
physical (such as pole vaulting or skiing), or a combination of both (such as deter­
mining how best to kick a ball closer into a goal when three attackers are rushing 
two defenders).
Games have goals that define the purpose of playing. Games have rules to create 
artificial restrictions. Games have a playing field where the game takes place, either 
on a board or a physical plot of land such as in football fields. Most importantly, 
games have players who follow the rules, on the playing field, to achieve the game’s 
goal. Games are simply a way to compete against ourselves or against others to test 
our skills and strategies in a regulated environment.
Designing games is a different skill than playing games. To design a game that 
others will want to play, aspiring game designers must understand not only what a 
game is, but also the underlying elements that make a game work, and that’s what 
this part of the book is all about.
Part I
Design Elements of a Game

Chapter 1
Creating a Game Idea
There’s no shortage of ideas for games. The real question isn’t what game do you 
want to make but why do you want to make a game in the first place? If you want to 
make a game just to make money, it’s easy to take shortcuts by chasing the latest 
trend. Unfortunately this often creates a copycat, generic, derivative game. If that’s 
all you want to do, then this book is not for you.
This book is for people who want to understand how games work so they can 
turn their ideas into an original game that captures their enthusiasm and creative 
vision. By understanding what game components exist and how they work, you’ll 
have a better idea which features are best for your game idea. Ideally, a game should 
satisfy you, the market, and the people playing your game.
The best way a game can satisfy you, as the designer, is to complete it. Unfinished 
game designs help no one. Even poor game designs can teach you mistakes to avoid 
so you can create a better game next time. Think of every game design as a learning 
experience that can help you get one step closer to making the best game possible.
Chances are good that no game will be perfect, but you can learn from each one 
so your next game will likely be better, more ambitious, and closer to the perfection 
you keep aiming to reach.
Just completing a game can be a success. Learning new technology or game 
making techniques can be a success. Developing or enhancing your existing skill 
and knowledge in designing, marketing, and selling games can be a success. The 
enjoyment that comes from creating a game can be a success.
Making a game will always involve problems and compromises, yet overcoming 
these obstacles can be part of the fun of making a game. If you aren’t happy making 
a game, why bother doing it? Given a choice between making a game that you don’t 
care about or a game that taught you numerous lessons, challenged you to overcome 
problems, and made you happy regardless of its ultimate success or failure, which 
experience would you rather have?

Thought Exercise
Identify what you want to get out of making a game. It might be the challenge of 
making your first game, it might be the chance to experiment with specific technol­
ogy (such as virtual reality), or it might be filling a particular niche in the game 
market that’s currently being overlooked or ignored. Whatever you want to get out 
of making a game, write it down and keep this statement where you can see it 
every day.
By identifying your purpose for making a game, your purpose acts as a guide­
line. Every day while you’re working on your game, use this purpose to make sure 
you don’t stray away from the original reason you even wanted to make that particu­
lar game.
Here’s the wrong way to make your game. Start with a vague idea and rush into 
creating the artwork and designing the playing pieces. If you’re creating a video 
game, add in the extra steps of putting music and sound effects into your game as 
well as writing code to make your game actually work.
This approach will get you started right away so you feel like you’re making 
progress, but it too often leads to a dead end. The problem is that you can’t rush into 
making your game before you even know what game you’re putting together in the 
first place.
Inevitably, you’ll wind up creating art you don’t need or that doesn’t match your 
game anymore or you’ll write code for features that technically make your game 
work but fail to make your game fun and interesting. The end result is that you’ll 
have to rethink and rewrite large portions of your game over and over again. You’ll 
wind up with different games pieces that don’t work together and you can look for­
ward to restarting or rewriting the same items until you finally decide to abandon the 
whole project out of frustration.
The better way to make a game is to start with an idea and realize ideas are noth­
ing more than empty air. The real value of any idea is how you implement it from a 
vague, abstract thought into a physical (or digital) working product. People don’t 
pay for ideas. People pay for results. As long as you can turn ideas (your own or 
other people’s) into working products, you’ll always be in demand.
So the first step to game design is to imagine you’ve already completed your 
game. Now how are you going to describe it to potential publishers, studios, and 
players? If you can’t give a clear, precise description to the question, “What is your 
game about,” your idea is likely still in the formative stage. Now is the time to crys­
tallize your thoughts before wasting time trying to create a game with no clear idea 
of what you’re trying to accomplish.
The first step is to give your game a descriptive name. Game titles must do the 
following:
•	 Grab attention
•	 Hint at what the game’s action will be
•	 Suggest the game tone
1  Creating a Game Idea

5
Even the best game will be useless if you can’t get people curious about playing it. 
So the main purpose of a game title is to grab people’s attention. Once a game title 
grabs someone’s attention, the next step is to hint at what the player will do within 
the game. Finally, the game title should also describe the game world and tone.
Of course, doing all this may seem impossible, especially when you want to be 
descriptive without being wordy. Ignoring any artwork, the game title may be the 
first thing people see so if the game title doesn’t sound interesting, nobody will 
bother to find out if your game is fun to play. Game titles give your game the only 
chance to make a great first impression.
The best game titles are short, descriptive, and intriguing. Study the following 
game titles:
•	 SimCity – The apparent combination of the words “Simulation” and “City” sug­
gests a game about controlling a city.
•	 Assassin’s Creed – The word “Assassin’s” hints that the player will have to assas­
sinate enemies.
•	 Grand Theft Auto – Suggests stealing and driving cars to get away.
•	 Candy Crush – Suggests multiple pieces of candy that fall to crush items.
•	 Tomb Raider – Suggests sneaking into tombs to steal valuable objects while 
avoiding traps and enemies.
•	 StarCraft – Suggests a science fiction setting involving starships.
•	 The Last of Us – Suggests a survival game in a bleak setting.
•	 War Thunder – The word “War” in the title clearly implies battles of some kind.
•	 Angry Birds – The odd combination between “Birds” and “Angry” suggests con­
trolling birds to fight in a battle.
Study your favorite games and ask yourself what about their titles grabbed your 
attention? Notice the emotional feeling each game title evokes. “Angry Birds” and 
“Candy Crush” evoke far different emotions than “The Last of Us” or “Assassin’s 
Creed.” The best game titles evoke strong, distinct emotions that accurately describe 
what your game is about so it appeals directly to your target audience.
Choose words that convey strong emotions, visual images, or action. “Red Dead 
Redemption” doesn’t tell you it’s a Western, but each word evokes a strong feeling. 
“Dead” implies death and the rhyme with “Red” makes the entire phrase memora­
ble. In addition, “Red” can also hint of blood. Finally, “Redemption” suggests a 
complete story arc.
On the other hand, a game title like “Kitten Rampage” suggests humor involving 
a kitten causing chaos. Anyone interested in “Kitten Rampage” will likely expect a 
humorous game involving exaggerated actions from a kitten that the player controls.
Thought Exercise
Create 5–10 titles for your game idea. As a shortcut, study existing game titles that 
you like and try to mimic those game titles for your own idea. Experiment with short 
game titles of 1–3 words. Then experiment with longer game titles of 4 or 
more words.
Thought Exercise

6
Focus on the action, emotions, or setting of your game idea. Start with clear 
descriptions of your game idea and then substitute words or phrases that are more 
suggestive and less precise. For example, a title like “Car Thief” may be descriptive, 
but it lacks any sense of intrigue like “Grand Theft Auto.” Similarly, “Survive a 
Serial Killer” may accurately describe the game’s action but “Dead By Daylight” 
sounds far more intriguing.
Compare game titles that cover the same topic but in completely different emo­
tions. For example, “Left 4 Dead” suggests zombies in a horror, survival setting 
while “Plants vs. Zombies” implies a far more whimsical tone.
Coming up with the perfect game title takes time so make up as many names as 
possible. A good game title acts like a guideline to help you identify the gameplay 
and tone of your game idea for both you (and your team) and any outsiders (publish­
ers, studios, investors, and players).
Crafting Your Game’s Pitch
A great game title is the first step. The second step is to describe, in one or two sen­
tences, what your game is about. Your game pitch expands on the game title and 
provides more details without giving everything away.
Imagine a major game studio asks about your game. A short, snappy game title 
can intrigue them. If they want to know more, they’ll ask for the pitch to better 
understand what your game is about. This combination of a catchy game title and an 
intriguing description of the game action is meant to get publishers, investors, stu­
dios, and potential players to say, “Tell me more.”
More importantly, a well-crafted game pitch can also guide you in creating and 
finishing your game idea. As you create your game, make sure it fulfills the promise 
of your game pitch. If not, then you either need to modify your game or your 
game pitch.
A game pitch must describe:
•	 What players do within the game
•	 What makes your game different
Suppose a game title suggests a game about dragons. However, you can make any 
type of game involving dragons. Is it a game about dragon racing like horse racing? 
Is it a game about controlling armies of dragons to conquer a fantasy world? Is it a 
game about role-playing as a dragon? Is it a game about raising dragons? The game 
title might describe dragons and hint at the game tone, but the game pitch must let 
us know exactly what players actually do.
1  Creating a Game Idea

Thought Exercise
Come up with several potential game titles and pick one. In one or two sentences, 
describe what players do within that game idea. For ideas of game pitches, visit the 
Wikipedia page of different video games that offer brief descriptions of the game­
play such as the following:
•	 Elden Ring is an action role-playing game played in a third-person perspective 
with gameplay focusing on combat and exploration.
•	 Call of Duty places the player in control of an infantry soldier who makes use of 
various authentic World War II firearms in combat.
•	 Portal consists of a series of puzzles that must be solved by teleporting the play­
er’s character and simple objects between two flat planes.
•	 Overwatch is an online team-based game designed around squad-based combat 
with two opposing teams of six players each.
•	 Minecraft players explore a blocky, procedurally generated 3D world with virtu­
ally infinite terrain to extract raw materials, craft tools and items, and build struc­
tures, earthworks and simple machines.
•	 80 Days is a branching, narrative storytelling game loosely based on the Jules 
Verne novel, “Around the World in Eighty Days.”
•	 Fallout: A Post Nuclear Role Playing Game is a role-playing game that takes 
place in a mid-22nd century post-apocalyptic and retro-futuristic world.
Notice that each of these game pitches expand on the game title. “Portal” and 
“Overwatch” are just one word titles that could mean anything, so the pitch further 
explains exactly what each game is about.
Remember, you can never please everybody. Don’t create a generic, vague 
description of your game to appeal to as many people as possible because you’ll 
likely appeal to nobody. Instead, target a specific audience.
For example, the title of “Call of Duty” might grab someone’s attention but when 
they find out it’s a game about controlling an individual soldier, they might be more 
interested in a military game where players control entire armies instead. Your game 
pitch is meant to both weed out people who won’t be interested in your game at the 
same time it directly appeals to people who will be interested in your game.
If you keep your game pitch too vague to broaden its appeal, people who want 
one type of game will eventually find out what your game is really about and lose 
interest anyway. Game pitches that are too broad will risk feeling too generic and 
appeal to nobody. Only people interested in exactly what your game offers will ever 
give you money.
Besides describing your game in finer detail, a game pitch must also emphasize 
what’s different. There are plenty of horror games, but “Dead Space” is different 
because it’s a horror game set in a science fiction setting. “Guitar Hero” is a music 
game where players imitate rock stars playing a guitar. “Dance Dance Revolution” 
is also a music game but players must coordinate their movements in time with 
popular songs as they dance.

Some ways to make a game different include:
•	 Change the topic
•	 Change the tone
•	 Change the scale
•	 Combine game ideas
•	 Create a unique game setting/world
•	 Subvert expectations
Changing the topic of a game creates an entirely different challenge. Civilization is 
a resource management game that puts you in control of running an entire nation. 
Apply that same idea to another setting and you might get Roller Coaster Tycoon, 
where you control an amusement park. Pick a more scientific, futuristic setting and 
you get Planet Crafter, where you terraform a planet. Even though resource man­
agement games work alike, each unique topic creates distinctive challenges for 
players to overcome.
The tone of a game can be serious, terrifying, romantic, dramatic, or even humor­
ous. Street Fighter is a fighting game that emphasizes cartoonish violence. Super 
Smash Brothers is also a fighting game that emphasizes cartoonish violence, but in 
a far more playful manner.
The scale of a game determines whether players focus on tactics or strategy. Metal 
Gear Solid lets players control a special forces soldier while Company of Heroes is a 
strategy game where players control entire military units on a battlefield.
Few games are one-dimensional. Games often combine different game elements 
such as Far Cry 3, which lets players choose between attacking enemies directly 
with rifles, grenades, and rockets, or choose a stealthier option to slip past enemies 
using silencers and knives. Rocket League combines elements of car racing with 
sports to create rocket-propelled cars trying to knock a soccer ball into a goal.
Another way to create a distinctive game is to apply a unique setting to your 
game world. Fallout 3 is about surviving in a post-apocalyptic world following a 
nuclear holocaust, but this futuristic world is stuck within a whimsical setting of 
1950s style technology. This creates a completely different game from Metro 2033, 
which depicts bleak survival in a Moscow subway station after a nuclear war.
A final way to create a unique game is to subvert expectations. In most shooting 
games, the object is to hit enemy players. In Splatoon, the object is to miss enemy 
players and spray paint on the surrounding area.
There’s no point in making a game that’s an exact copy of an existing game with 
minor cosmetic differences. By making a unique game, you can fully express your 
ideas and creativity as a game designer.
Thought Exercise
Take your game idea and play with all the different ways to twist your idea. Change 
the scale. Change the topic. Go for the bizarre. Instead of having soldiers fighting on 
a battlefield, what if you had animals or even plants?
1  Creating a Game Idea

Change the setting to serious to humorous. Choose a different target audience 
such as only women, only people interested in fantasy, or only people who like hor­
ror. The goal is to spur your imagination in ways that you wouldn’t normally 
think about.
Once you know your game title and a brief description of what your game is all 
about, the final step is to write 3-4 additional sentences that more fully conveys what 
players will do and experience while playing your game.
The purpose of a game description paragraph is to paint a visual picture of how 
players begin the game, what they’ll experience, and the goal they’re trying to 
achieve. This provides a complete picture of what the game will be. The combina­
tion of a game title, game pitch, and game description helps clarify your vision for 
your game idea while also making it easy for anyone to understand what your game 
is about. Study these examples to help create a description for your own game:
Ticket to Ride is a board game depicting a railway map of the United States and 
southern Canada. Players claim train routes across the map and earn points based on 
the length of the claimed routes, whoever completes the longest continuous railway, 
and whether the player can connect distant cities. The game ends when one player 
has only two or fewer of their colored train pieces.
Bejeweled is a video game that displays rows of colored gems (Red, Orange, 
Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple and White). Players attempt to swap two adjacent gems 
to create a line or row of 3 or more gems, which disappear once lined up. When 
gems are cleared from the board, gems above the game board fall downwards, 
potentially causing chain reactions, which award more points to the player.
Set in the fictional Kingdom of Khanduras in the mortal realm, Diablo lets play­
ers control a lone hero battling to rid the world of Diablo, the Lord of Terror. Players 
must journey through sixteen randomly generated dungeon levels until they finally 
enter Hell to fight a final battle against Diablo himself.
The combination of your game title, game pitch, and game description should 
excite and intrigue people so they’ll want to play (and buy) your game. By first 
identifying what makes your idea interesting, you can focus on making your game 
fulfill the promise of its title, pitch, and description.
•	 The game title grabs attention.
•	 The game pitch generates interest in the game and what makes it unique.
•	 The game description explains what players do within the game from start to fin­
ish to stimulate the desire to get the game.
This combination of attention, interest, and desire increases the odds that your game 
will keep attracting new players for years to come.
Thought Exercise
Share your game title, pitch, and description with others to get their reaction. Ideally, 
share your title, pitch, and description with people you don’t know. The more honest 
reactions you get from as many people as possible, the better you’ll be able to 
sharpen your game title, pitch, and description.
Thought Exercise

10
When you have a great game title, pitch, and description, you’ll also have a solid 
guidepost to follow. This can make sure your game idea doesn’t stray from what 
others found most appealing from your game title, pitch, and description.
Summary
Game design is more than just the technical skills of creating artwork and making 
up rules for how to play your game. Game design starts by identifying what makes 
your game idea appealing. Once you know what people find appealing about your 
game, then you can do the technical work of actually making that game achieve 
your vision.
Notice that defining your game title, pitch, and description gives you an initial 
direction. It’s entirely possible that as you design a game, you’ll run across prob­
lems or discover fresh ideas that could change the way your game works. However, 
if you don’t choose an initial direction as soon as possible, you’ll risk flailing around 
with no direction or focus at all, which will waste time and increase frustration. Stay 
flexible enough to change directions at any time while still retaining the basic struc­
ture of your idea.

Chapter 2
Defining a Game Idea
Unless you’re making games as a hobby, solely for your own amusement, you’ll 
probably want to release your game on the market. That means you need to define 
what success in the market means for your game.
For many games, success means making money. However the financial amount 
that could spell success for an indie game developer might mean disaster for a major 
game studio. By identifying what success means for your game, you define what 
you want to achieve. Every time you need to make a major decision about your 
game, ask yourself which choices give you the best odds for reaching your defini­
tion of success.
Of course, not everyone may want to sell a game. Social conscious games might 
want to raise awareness for a cause while educational games might want to improve 
teaching a particular skill or topic. Independent game developers might just be 
happy seeing other people playing their games and giving them feedback. The point 
is that by defining success in the market for your game, you can design your game 
from start to finish towards reaching that specific goal.
Thought Exercise
Imagine your game is complete and on the market. How will you measure if it’s a 
success? If you don’t know how to measure if your game is a success or not, you’ll 
risk pursuing a vague goal in the distant future. This is often a recipe for disaster as 
you lose motivation and focus because you don’t know what you’re trying to accom­
plish in the end.
First, identify what people will get out of playing your game. Every game should 
meet a specific need. Games that fail to meet specific needs are games that likely 
meet no one’s needs (and thus fail in the market).

Board games typically emphasize encouraging social interaction (poker, 
Monopoly, Pictionary). Mobile games entertain people for short periods of time, 
often while they’re alone. Console and major PC games often strive to immerse 
players in a completely different world for long periods of time.
By defining what you want players to get out of your game, you can identify the 
core of your game, which acts as another guidepost for creating your game.
Thought Exercise
Imagine someone sees your game for the first time. Why would they want to play it? 
Why would they want to play it multiple times? Why would they want to tell their 
friends about your game?
Every game’s success rests on satisfying the game designer, the market, and the 
players in various degrees. If a game only satisfies the game designer, nobody else 
might care about it, but that can still be fine if you achieved a specific goal such as 
learning a certain programming language or using a graphics design program to cre­
ate your own artwork.
If a game only satisfies the market, it might be a temporary success, but will 
likely disappear as people forget about it over time. If you’re only making a game 
for money, fame, or market share, none of that matters if you lose your happiness 
and well-being in the process.
Sometimes a game may satisfy the players, but still fail in the market if it can’t 
attract a large enough audience. Maybe you defined the target audience too nar­
rowly, maybe you didn’t promote the game correctly, or maybe outside circum­
stances worked against you (such as releasing a game too similar to a rival game 
from a larger publisher).
Every game will succeed at some level and fail on another level. Game success 
is a combination of planning, skill, talent, luck, and random circumstances that are 
completely out of your control. All you can do is strive to create the best game pos­
sible with the resources you have right now.
There is no right or wrong way to design a game, but by knowing your three 
goals ahead of time (designer satisfaction, market satisfaction, and player satisfac­
tion), you can maximize your chances of creating a game that will succeed, what­
ever your definition of success might be.
Remember, a game can be a success even if it never makes any money and hardly 
anyone plays it. Making yourself happy creating a game is the first step. Making 
others happy while playing your game is a second, optional step. Achieving finan­
cial success is the third and last optional step.
Define what success means to you for each game you create and then aim to 
achieve that goal, and you’ll be a success regardless of whatever else happens.
Once you know what you want to achieve with your game, start shaping the 
general game design. Don’t get bogged down too soon on specific details, such as 
deciding which game engine to use or which social network to promote your game. 
2  Defining a Game Idea

13
All that can come later. Initially, the goal at this stage is to flesh out a broad view of 
your game by answering these questions to sharpen your game’s focus:
•	 What will people play?
•	 What will people do?
•	 What will people feel?
•	 What will people remember?
•	 What will the game experience mean in the end?
What Will People Play?
There is no completely original game idea because if there was, nobody would rec­
ognize it. People recognize games because they look and behave similar to other 
games they’ve played and enjoyed. People play games because they enjoy three 
types of challenges:
•	 Physical challenges
•	 Intellectual challenges
•	 Random chance challenges
Physical challenges often test a player’s dexterity in how fast they can move or how 
well they can coordinate multiple actions simultaneously. Some games that chal­
lenge physical abilities include sports (boxing, basketball, skiing, karate, etc.) and 
video games (first-person shooters, vehicle simulations, 2D platformers, etc.). Even 
the board game tiddlywinks requires coordination as players attempt to flip discs 
into a pot.
Physical challenges tend to restrict the number of possible players. Sumo wres­
tling requires a different body size (big and bulky) than a basketball player (tall and 
fast). Likewise, video games that emphasize speed and dexterity reward dedicated 
players while frustrating novices from getting started and sticking with the game 
long enough to increase their own skill to compete against players who learned the 
game much earlier.
On the other extreme from physical challenges are intellectual challenges that 
force players to analyze current situations and then plan a strategy to maximize their 
chance for success. Popular intellectual challenge games are Go, chess, and Xiangqi 
(also called Chinese chess), but even a simple puzzle game like Hangman chal­
lenges players to think.
Like extreme physical challenge games, extreme intellectual challenge games 
restrict the number of possible players. Players of different intellectual skills might 
enjoy chess, but finding opponents close to your own skill level can prove difficult 
at times.
Random chance challenges are often used in children’s games because they give 
everyone a chance to win regardless of their physical skill or intellectual level. 
Children’s board games such as Candy Land or Chutes and Ladders rely completely 
on random chance where nobody has an advantage. Many casino games rely mostly

on random chance. Slot machines give everyone an equal chance of winning (along 
with an equally larger chance of losing) regardless of what you know or how skilled 
you might be.
Most games combine physical, intellectual, and random chance challenges in 
varying degrees. Sports are mostly physical challenges, but include intellectual 
challenges in matching players up against opposing players or strategizing team 
actions. Sports also include an element of chance where players risk dropping or 
missing a ball.
Video games often combine physical challenges with intellectual challenges and 
random chance. A first-person shooter video game might force players to run, 
dodge, and shoot enemies (physical challenge) while deciphering puzzles to unlock 
access to other areas on a map or plan a strategy for attacking an enemy army (intel­
lectual challenge). Like sports, video games often introduce an element of chance 
when moving, attacking, or defending.
Random elements in a game forces players to deal with uncertainty. Such uncer­
tainty increases suspense in games by giving players a choice between low-risk, low 
reward options or high-risk, high reward options. Randomness allows lesser skilled 
players to defeat higher skilled players, which is nearly impossible in pure intel­
lectual skill games like Go or chess.
All games are a combination of physical challenges, intellectual challenges, and 
random chance challenges. Every game relies on one type of challenge with lesser 
degrees of the other two types of challenges. The variation of each challenge is what 
creates a unique game.
Thought Exercise
Come up with an idea for a game. How would your game idea play differently if it 
emphasized a player’s physical dexterity? How would your game play different if it 
emphasized intellectual knowledge? How would your game play differently if it 
was guided largely by random chance?
By choosing one challenge to emphasize with lesser degrees of the other two 
challenges, you can alter the gameplay until it provides the right balance for your 
game idea.
Once you have a rough idea for how you want players to experience your game 
(as a physical challenge, as an intellectual challenge, or a random chance chal­
lenge), you can then decide how you want to present your game. Three common 
types of games include:
•	 Board games
•	 Card games
•	 Video games
Board games rely on a single playing field that defines where all the game action 
occurs. The size of the board defines the boundaries where playing pieces can go 
and valid places to move playing pieces.
2  Defining a Game Idea

15
Card games rely on the interaction between different items printed on each card. 
This interaction, along with the different types of cards and the total number of 
cards defines how the game works.
One drawback with both board and card games is that they’re often best when 
played with another person. In the absence of a human opponent, most board and 
card games aren’t as much fun to play alone or may be impossible to play alone.
Video games allow individuals to play games alone because the computer either 
replaces a human opponent or makes it easy to find players all over the world so 
you’ll always have someone to play the game with you.
Two other unique features of video games are the ability to simplify complex 
rules and the ability to allow real-time, simultaneous movement.
With board games, the more detailed the gameplay, the more complicated the 
rules. That means players have to read and understand the rules before playing, which 
severely limits the number of possible players willing to learn the rules ahead of time.
Video games enforce complex rules without the player needing to know them all. 
Instead of trying to force players to memorize a complex set of rules, video games 
simply offer players valid choices. Players can’t violate any rules because any rule-­
breaking options aren’t available at all.
Not only can video games enforce game rules, making it impossible for players 
to choose illegal actions, but video games can also allow hidden and simultaneous 
movement. In the game Battleship, players secretly position their playing pieces on 
a board and rely on trust to determine hits and misses. A video game can eliminate 
this need to trust your opponent and ensure that both players follow the rules.
In board games, players must move in turns. This can create an artificial and less 
realistic gameplay. In a video game, players can move at the same time and the 
computer tracks their position at every second, which creates a more realistic and 
dynamic game that can’t be duplicated by any board game.
Finally, video games allow for physical interaction between players and the com­
puter. Video games allow different types of input from traditional keyboard/mouse 
combinations to dedicated game controllers, gesture recognizers, touch screens, 
touch pads, and voice input. Such varied input options give video games greater 
versatility in player control and gameplay interaction.
Thought Exercise
Take your game idea and imagine how it would look as a board game? As a card 
game? As a video game?
Board games restrict gameplay in a specific area with rules for placing and mov­
ing game pieces on the board.
Card games focus on interaction between cards.
Video games can replace a human opponent, enforce complex rules, allow hid­
den or simultaneous movement, and offer a wide range of player control and input.

What can you learn by imagining your game as a board, card, and video game?

What Will People Do?
A game’s challenges (physical, intellectual, or random chance) and game type 
(board, card, or video) defines what game people can play. The next step is to get 
more detailed and define what players will do within your game. What players do 
most often must be fun and interesting because they’ll be doing it repeatedly.
Four common gameplay actions include:
•	 Movement
•	 Combat
•	 Resource management
•	 Puzzle solving
Movement is the most common action players can do in a game whether it’s physi­
cally running around a playing field, moving a game piece on a board or within a 3D 
imaginary world in a video game, or selecting and arranging items in a card game.
Movement involves choices. Make the wrong move and you risk losing the game. 
Make the right move and you increase your chances of winning even against tre­
mendous odds. Ultimately the purpose of movement is to attack or score against 
opponents. Therefore movement is nothing more than a way to increase your chance 
of winning the game.
The second gameplay action is combat, which can either mean eliminating an 
enemy or scoring points. In sports, scoring points often means placing an object 
such as a ball into a specific goal while your opponent tries to stop you. In racing 
games, the object is to place yourself or the object you’re controlling across the fin­
ish line before anyone else.
A third gameplay action involves strategy collecting, managing, and expending 
resources. In many economic simulation games, resource management defines the 
entire game where players control the growth and management of a city or country. 
In other games, resource management is just one aspect of the game, such as trading 
and acquiring players for a sports team or deciding which weapons, tools, and armor 
to carry in a role-playing game.
In a sports game, resource management can increase your chances of winning 
the game but isn’t usually the primary purpose of the game. Likewise in role-­playing 
games, choosing which items to carry can increase the chance of success but almost 
nobody will play such a game solely to manage a character’s resources.
Puzzle solving can be the whole point of a game, such as escape rooms where 
players must find clues to figure out how to get out. In many games, puzzle solving 
forces players to figure out problems so they can continue the game or gain access 
to resources.
Ultimately, the whole point of a game is to defeat an opponent who is trying to 
do the same thing to you. Therefore the fun in a game arises from the physical, intel­
lectual, and random chance challenges involving movement, resource management, 
combat, and puzzle solving.
2  Defining a Game Idea

17
Thought Exercise
Pick a game and define how players can attack or score against an opponent to 
achieve victory.
How does movement within the game increase the chance a player can attack 
and score?
How does resource management within the game increase the chance a player 
can attack and score?
How does puzzle solving within a game increase the chance a player can attack 
and score?
Repeat the above process with your own game idea.
Enhancing Challenges with Constraints and Limitations
Games are about constraints and limitations. In every game, there are a fixed set of 
valid moves so players must choose the best possible moves within those limited 
options. It’s illegal for soccer players (except for the goalie) to hit a ball with their 
hands just as it’s also illegal for soccer players to run outside of the playing field 
boundaries, put as many players on to the field as they wish, or use bicycles or 
scooters to make their players move faster.
Similarly, there are limitations on resource management. In many sports, teams 
have a fixed budget they can spend to acquire players, and there’s a limit on the 
number of players on every team. In many games, similar economics constrain what 
players can buy since they have a limited amount of money.
Constraints and limitations are what actually defines gameplay. First, limitations 
challenge players to win despite any restrictions. In war simulations where players 
control entire countries, the challenge can be juggling factory production between 
civilian needs and military needs in addition to outwitting and outmaneuvering your 
opponents on the battlefield.
Second, limitations force players to get creative within the game rules. In basket­
ball, you’re not supposed to foul the other team’s players. However when the score 
is close and the game is nearly over, it’s common to foul the opposing team’s play­
ers to keep them from scoring. The long shot hope is that they’ll miss their free 
throws (which score 1 point each) to give the ball back to your team so you can 
score a basket (and earn 2 points to catch up or surpass the opponent’s score).
Another common restriction involves time or quantity boundaries. Time limits 
force players to reach a goal by a certain time. In sports, the winner is the player or 
team with the highest score in the end. Having a higher score in the beginning or 
middle of the game doesn’t matter. Time limits increase suspense because as the 
game nears the end, players often make last second, desperate attempts to emerge 
victorious.
Quantity boundaries force a game to end when something runs out such as in 
Monopoly when every player but one runs out of money. Game tournaments often 
end when one player or team is the last one who remains undefeated.
Thought Exercise

18
Limitations identify what you cannot do. Boundaries define how far you can go 
before you reach an illegal move. In chess, you must trap your opponent’s king 
using the restrictions of both the playing field and the limitations of the way differ­
ent playing pieces can move. You aren’t allowed to punch your opponent in the face 
nor are you allowed to reach across the chessboard and knock over your opponent’s 
pieces. Games are interesting precisely because of their boundary restrictions, 
movement limitations, and resource management constraints.
Look at limitations in two ways. First, limitations define what players cannot do. 
Second, limitations indirectly define what players can do. In soccer, players cannot 
touch the ball with their hands (except for the goalie). That indirectly allows players 
to hit the ball with any other part of their body such as their feet, head, or chest.
Defining what players can do specifically limits their choices only to those fixed list 
of options. Defining what players cannot do allows for more creative freedom since 
players can choose actions that bend the rules but don’t break them. However, this 
openness also allows players to take advantage of rules, which can appear as cheating.
Thought Exercise
Pick a sport, board game, card game, or video game and define its boundary restric­
tions, movement limitations, and resource management constraints. How would the 
gameplay change if you modified or removed any of these restrictions?
What are the boundary restrictions of your game’s playing field? What are the 
movement limitations of your game’s players or playing pieces? What are the 
resource management constraints?
Summary
This chapter asks game designers to define “What will people play?” and “What 
will people do?” What people play defines the physical, intellectual, and random 
change challenges the game offers to players. What people do involves moving, 
attacking/scoring, and resource management along with boundary restrictions.
Defining these broad principles helps shape the overall game design without get­
ting bogged down in specific details too soon. When you can define the challenges 
of your game (“What will people play?”) and the options available to players (“What 
will players do?”), you’ll have a strong foundation to define the game details that 
support your original idea.

Chapter 3
The Appeal of Games
The previous chapter asked you to answer the questions, “What will people play?” 
and “What will people do?” These questions help you define the types of challenges 
in your game and the actions players must take to win.
Many games just focus on this basic level of gameplay, but if you want to create 
a deeper, more emotional experience, you should answer the following three ques­
tions about your game idea as well:
•	 What will people feel?
•	 What will people remember?
•	 What will the game experience mean in the end?
What Will People Feel?
In any game, winners always experience triumph while losers experience disap­
pointment. However, games should go beyond these primal emotions and create 
additional emotional experiences specific to your game regardless of whether they 
win or lose. The type of emotion you want players to feel defines the game genre.
Horror games convey a sense of dread and fear as a way to entertain players. 
Action games emphasize overcoming constant threats through fighting in different 
ways. Puzzle games challenge players to analyze and solve difficult problems. 
Humorous games often poke fun at popular game cliches such as Goat Simulator, 
which mocks simulation games by letting you control a goat on a farm. Games 
evoke strong emotions to enhance gameplay and make a game more memorable as 
a result.

One way to evoke emotions is to combine gameplay with the setting. Consider a 
game where players explore different rooms in a dungeon and examine objects in a 
fantasy setting like Dungeons & Dragons.
However, you can change the emotions of the game by changing the setting. 
Instead of setting these rooms in a dungeon, change the setting to a mansion where 
players must search for clues about a murder. The gameplay is the same but the 
actions in searching a mansion means something completely different from search­
ing a dungeon. A change in setting evokes different emotions in the player beyond 
the thrill of winning or the disappointment of losing.
To create emotion in any game idea, identify the core emotion you want players 
to experience. Once you know the core emotion you want your game to offer, use 
this as a filter to accept or eliminate any ideas that enhance or fail to support your 
game’s core emotional experience.
To identify the core emotion in your game, look at popular game genres that 
emphasize different emotions:
•	 Action – Fighting, running, and other actions that require dexterity (Excitement)
•	 Adventure – Exploring areas without necessarily relying on dexterity (Escapism)
•	 Horror – Hiding, running, and escaping (Fear)
•	 Mystery – Solving puzzles (Psychological satisfaction)
•	 Comedy – Poke fun at a specific target (Laughter)
•	 Simulation – Control a realistic vehicle or organization (Wish fulfillment)
•	 Strategy – Control a large organization such as an army or a corporation (Mastery)
•	 Romance – Explore relationships between people (Love)
•	 Serious – Examine a dramatic dilemma (Grief)
Thought Exercise
Define the main emotion you want people to feel while playing your game by iden­
tifying the genre of your game. Every genre makes a promise to the player so your 
game must deliver on this promised emotion.
Of course games rarely embrace a single genre. Most games embrace two genres 
where one genre defines the main gameplay while the second genre defines the 
game tone. For example, World of Tanks embraces both the Simulation and Action 
genres. Action involves fighting in a tank while Simulation comes from choosing to 
fight using a variety of historical tank models from World War II.
This lets players play “What if?” by letting them compare the strengths and 
weaknesses of different historical tank models in simulated tank battles. The main 
genre is Action, since players want to shoot enemy tanks, but the tone is based on 
Simulation.
Switch these genres around and you can create an entirely different game. 
Football Manager is a video game that focuses on Simulation first where players 
manage a football team. Then based on their decisions, they watch their team play 
3  The Appeal of Games

21
against other teams. Thus the main genre is Simulation where the tone is defined by 
the Action genre.
What is the main genre of your game idea?
What is a secondary genre that can shape the tone of the main genre?
Study games that fall under the same genres as your game idea so you can learn 
what they did right and what they did wrong.
What Will People Remember?
Most people have played plenty of games. The best games stick in your memory 
while mediocre games quickly fade from memory. Imagining your game idea as 
complete, what will make it memorable? What’s different about your game com­
pared to every other game already out on the market?
Whenever a popular game appears, numerous copycats appear right away. 
Despite superficial changes, these copycat games are almost never as popular as the 
original game that they copied. That’s because they offer nothing different. All they 
can hope for is to siphon off players from the original game.
So if you want to make a game that people will remember, don’t just clone an 
existing game (although cloning an existing game can be an excellent way to dupli­
cate the way a game works). To make a unique and memorable game, consider these 
options:
•	 Modify existing features
•	 Add or subtract features
•	 Change the setting or tone
•	 Exaggerate a feature
•	 Combine features
•	 Subvert expectations
Modifying existing features simply copies a feature from one game but alters it 
somehow to give players a different, but similar experience. Consider two racing 
games: Assetto Corsa and Gran Turismo Sport. Both video games simulate racing 
realistic cars. However, Assetto Corsa only simulates actual race tracks from around 
the world while Gran Turismo Sport offers both real racetracks and fantasy race 
tracks that have never existed.
Adding a feature creates different gameplay while still retaining the main fea­
tures that players enjoy. In Assetto Corsa, players can only rely on realistic driving 
methods to defeat their opponents. While Mario Kart is also a racing game, it gives 
players power ups and weapons to block players behind them or shoot objects at 
players ahead of them. Adding playful weapons creates an entirely different experi­
ence even though Mario Kart is just a racing game like Assetto Corsa.
Subtracting features can be another way to change the feel and experience of a 
game. Many horror games emphasize fear through realistic, colorful graphics but 
Limbo subtracts both color and realism to display eerie black and white, simplistic 
What Will People Remember?

22
graphics that make the game look and feel unnatural. Just this simple change makes 
Limbo more memorable than rival horror games.
In many games pitting you against numerous enemies, you may have a chance to 
fight back, even if you’re outgunned and outnumbered. Fighting as an underdog 
creates a greater challenge. However, strip away the ability to fight back and you 
create a greater sense of helplessness, which is perfect for horror games. Players in 
a horror game must find other ways to deal with enemies if you take away the option 
to fight.
Changing the setting or tone is another way to differentiate a game. The game 
Civilization lets you nurture a tribe from humble origins that gradually masters dif­
ferent levels of technology as they grow and expand. By substituting magic for 
technology, Warlock: Masters of the Arcane emulates Civilization except this sim­
ple change creates a game that appeals to an audience that enjoys fantasy.
Pokemon Go was one of the first popular augmented reality games. The basic 
gameplay involves roaming around trying to capture different types of Pokemon 
characters. However what make Pokemon Go memorable was that instead of roam­
ing around a cartoon map, players roam around the real world in search of Pokemon 
characters.
While many multiplayer games let people chat and play together over the 
Internet, Pokemon Go let people chat and play together in real life. Thus the game 
added a social element where you could meet and team up with fellow players who 
you could see and talk to without the need for cartoon avatars. It’s easy to develop 
friendships by chatting online, but meeting other players in person made Pokemon 
Go a far more socially engaging game.
Another way to change a game to make it more memorable is to exaggerate a 
single feature. In most first-person shooter games, players must maneuver wildly 
around obstacles while trying to shoot enemies charging at them. Superhot changes 
this dynamic by exaggerating the player’s movement.
Instead of moving frantically around obstacles, Superhot lets players speed up or 
slow down. If the player moves fast, the enemies move just as fast. If the player 
slows down, the enemies also slow down. If the player stops altogether, all enemies 
also stop as well, which can give you a chance to analyze a situation before moving 
once more. This unique game mechanic turns a traditional first-person shooter game 
into a combination first-person shooter with a strategy game element.
Combining features can create unique experiences. Creature in the Well lets you 
control a sword-wielding robot knight exploring a dungeon. This might seem like a 
typical dungeon crawl game, but inside the dungeon are elements from pinball such 
as bumpers and pins. Fighting your way through dungeon obstacles based on pin­
ball game elements is an odd combination that creates a distinct and memorable 
gameplay experience.
Another way to create a distinctive game is to subvert expectations. In most 
games, players learn the rules and once they understand the rules, the rules remain 
the same. In the game Move Or Die, the rules change with every level, forcing play­
ers to respond to completely different rules within a single game. Such rapid rule 
3  The Appeal of Games

23
changes make Move Or Die similar enough to understand, but different enough 
from practically every other game on the market.
Players should remember your game because it surprises and delights them in an 
unexpected manner. Ultimately, what players can do is what they’ll remember. The 
best way to make a game memorable is to give players an experience they can’t get 
from another game.
Thought Exercise
Take your game idea and choose one of the following to modify your idea:
•	 Modify a single feature
•	 Add a new feature
•	 Subtract an existing feature
•	 Change the setting or tone
•	 Exaggerate a feature
•	 Combine features between two different types of games
•	 Subvert a common feature in games
Apply each of these changes to your original idea, one at a time, and then analyze 
how this would change the gameplay experience. Then revert back to your original 
game idea and apply another change. By applying each change one at a time, you 
can better identify how that change might affect your game’s experience.
Remember, keep your core game idea intact. So if your core game is about rac­
ing, don’t eliminate that idea. Consider also reversing expectations. For example, in 
most sports, the goal is to get the highest score but in golf, the goal is to get the 
lowest score.
If your game idea is a first-person shooter, the typical goal is to gun down as 
many enemies as possible, but reverse that idea and examine how your game might 
drastically change if players had to avoid killing as many enemies as possible? What 
if players had to help as many enemies as possible?
Playing around with different game features can help you discover a range of 
possible alternate versions of your game that could be better than your original idea, 
so don’t be afraid to let your imagination go wild.
What Will the Game Experience Mean in the End?
Many games provide pure entertainment to players and that’s perfectly fine. 
However, many other games provide a meaningful experience by the end. This 
added meaning gives the game a far greater emotional impact than just gameplay 
and experiences within the game alone.
What Will the Game Experience Mean in the End?

24
If you want your game idea to create a meaningful experience for players at the 
end, it’s far better to define this emotional experience as early as possible. That way 
you can structure your entire game towards supporting this final emotional experi­
ence. Trying to tack on an emotional experience in the end likely won’t work.
Meaningful game experiences are essentially life lessons that you want players 
to learn emotionally. In “Journey,” the game is about reaching a distant mountain, 
but that goal teaches players that the real purpose of life is to enjoy the journey and 
not focus on the destination. To further mimic real life, “Journey” pairs players up 
with strangers who must cooperate through limited communication to reach your 
goal. This teaches you the importance of being nice to others on your journey 
through life.
In most games, the enjoyment comes from the choices you make. However in 
games that provide meaning, you’re often forced to reflect on why you choose cer­
tain actions over others and the consequences of your decisions.
While many games start with an action-oriented premise (such as rescuing a 
princess from a dungeon), meaningful games often start with a philosophical 
dilemma. In “To the Moon,” players live in a future where scientists can manipulate 
the memories of dying people to give them one last unique experience before they 
pass away.
“To the Moon” puts players in the role of manipulating the memories of a dying 
man who wants to experience going to the moon. The game challenges players to 
learn why this dying man wants the experience of going to the moon and what it 
means to him. Deciphering this man’s reasons helps you understand that life is short 
so you should pursue your dreams before it’s too late.
Meaningful games are meant to make you feel and think. Some games might 
simply be enjoyable diversions, but meaningful games can be both enjoyable and 
emotional. By creating a game that’s both fun and thoughtful, you can make your 
game unique and memorable in the market.
Thought Exercise
Pick a philosophical premise whether it’s related to your current game idea or not. 
Meaningful games force players to confront hard decisions. In action-oriented 
games, you might have a choice between killing an enemy or sneaking past an 
enemy. In a meaningful game, you might have that same choice, but later the game 
will force you to confront the consequences of your actions.
If you kill an enemy, you might be faced with the dead enemy’s widow and now 
fatherless child. If you sneak past an enemy, you might be faced with that enemy 
later killing one of your friends.
Think of a Catch-22 situation where there’s no clear cut right or wrong choice 
and that’s the type of philosophical premise that can make your game idea 
meaningful.
Pick a Catch-22 philosophical premise.
3  The Appeal of Games

25
Define major choices in your game that force players to confront the philosophi­
cal premise. Ideally, define the gameplay so it constantly forces players to face this 
philosophical premise. If you want to explore whether it’s right to kill or not, the 
gameplay could constantly force players to choose between killing enemies or let­
ting them live. In either case, players must deal with the consequences afterwards.
Summary
Everyone plays games. However, not everyone plays the same types of games. What 
one person might find fun, another person might dislike completely. You can never 
design a game that appeals to everyone. However, by understanding what makes 
games appealing, you can design a game that reaches the greatest number of people 
possible within your specific target audience.
Some games target the mass consumer market, such as Trivial Pursuit or 
Monopoly. Other games target niche markets such as the children’s game market 
(such as Candy Land or Mousetrap). The narrow the niche, the smaller the potential 
market but the greater the chances of meeting the needs of that particular target 
audience.
What makes a game appealing can be subjective, but consider the following traits 
found in popular games that have lasted for generations:
•	 Simple to learn, yet difficult to master (chess, Go, poker)
•	 A unique activity that creates a different and memorable experience from exist­
ing games (Scrabble, Pictionary, Twister)
•	 Engaging to play with others (bridge, sports, charades)
If a game is too easy to master, it gets boring. Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple game that 
children might enjoy but that adults do not since the game lacks challenge once you 
know the best moves to make. Likewise if a game can’t allow people to choose dif­
ferent strategies for playing, it can never become popular among a broad range of 
potential players.
If a game is too similar to existing games, it’s too easy to ignore.
If a game doesn’t allow playing with others, it’s potential audience will be too 
limited.
There will always be room for more games. The only question is what will make 
your game stand out from the crowd today and years into the future?

Chapter 4
Game Design Elements
Every game begins with a goal. This goal is the objective that players must achieve 
and is the whole purpose of playing the game. In many games, players (or teams of 
players) have identical goals. In sports, both teams are trying to throw the ball in a 
basket, kick it into a goal, or carry it into the opposing team’s end zone.
In board games like Monopoly, players are trying to get the most money. In a 
game like poker, players are trying to get the highest hand and ultimately win the 
most money. When players strive for the same goal, the winner is the one who gets 
the best score. This can mean getting the most (such as the highest score in base­
ball), getting the least (such as the lowest score in golf), or getting to a goal first 
(such as in a race). Whatever the case, goals give each player a direction to focus 
their action.
While some games give players identical goals, other games pose different goals 
for each player. One player might have the goal of getting to a certain location 
within a specific time limit while the other player might have the goal of stopping 
this first player from succeeding.
When players have identical or different goals, the game is often a race for each 
player to achieve their particular goal first, which they can do in two ways. First, 
they can direct all their efforts to achieving their goal. Two, they can keep the other 
player from reaching their goal. Often players do both and strive to reach their goal 
while hindering the other player at the same time.
With some games, the goal may simply to enjoy the activity in playing the game. 
Many people try to solve a Rubik’s cube in the shortest amount of time possible, but 
others might set their own goal of simply solving it eventually.
In some games, the goal is explicitly defined by the rules. In other games, players 
can challenge themselves with their own goals. In that way, each player can choose 
how they want to play that gives them the most enjoyment. Ultimately, the goal of 
any game is to have fun, whatever definition of fun might mean to you.

What makes a game challenging is the difficulty in achieving a goal. The fun in 
games comes from overcoming limitations and restrictions, which can occur through 
one or more of the following:
•	 The playing pieces
•	 The boundaries of the playing field
•	 The rules
•	 The actions of others (players and non-player characters)
Game Playing Pieces
Every game manipulates playing pieces such as a ball, cards, or even themselves (or 
symbols of themselves). In sports, players are literally in the game. In board games, 
players manipulate pieces that represent themselves within the game. In video 
games, players manipulate digital people or objects that represent themselves within 
the game.
Whether they’re literally playing themselves in a sport or manipulating an avatar 
of themselves within a board or video game, players strive to achieve a specific goal. 
Part of what’s stopping them from achieving that goal easily is their own 
limitations.
In real life, players can only run, jump, throw, dodge, and kick within physical 
limits. Even if they’re in peak health, they must still deal with fatigue over time 
within a game. On top of physical exertion, players must also engage in mental exer­
tion by making split second decisions at multiple points during the game. One 
wrong decision and players could lose. No matter what else happens within a game, 
players must always overcome their own limitations to achieve their goal.
Limitations define player avatars in board and video games as well. In a board 
game, players cannot move their playing pieces to an advantageous spot if that’s 
against the rules. In a video game, players must learn to control their avatars through 
controls such as touch gestures, keyboards, mouse, or game controller.
So part of a video game challenge involves learning what an avatar can do and 
part of the challenge arises from the player’s own physical limitations. Players must 
make split second decisions and then move fast enough to press the right key or 
move the mouse at precisely the right moment within a video game to achieve the 
correct movement that will achieve their goal.
In nearly every game, except those relying on pure chance, overcoming mental 
and physical challenges plays a decisive role in whether players win or lose the 
game. The more a game forces player’s to confront their physical and mental limita­
tions, the more challenging the game. The joy of winning stems directly from the 
physical and mental exertion needed to achieve victory.

Thought Exercise
Identify several different types of game such as a sport, a board game, and a video 
game. Identify the greatest physical challenge needed to win in each game. Identify 
the greatest mental challenge needed to win in each game.
Imagine removing this greatest physical or mental challenge. How would this 
affect the gameplay?
The Playing Field Boundaries
The players or their avatars are just one factor in determining the winner or loser of 
any game. A second factor is the playing field itself, which confines the gameplay 
within a specified area. In sports, that playing field defines the boundaries where the 
game must be played. In a board game, the board itself is the playing field while in 
video games, the playing field could be as vast as a digital universe. Yet even video 
games contain boundaries.
Even the most expansive, open world video game simulating multiple galaxies 
must still define what players can and cannot do. A game’s playing field always 
contains boundaries that shape where and how the game is played.
Change a game’s playing field boundary and you change the way the game 
works. If basketball hoops were placed ten inches off the ground instead of ten feet, 
the sport would be entirely different. Lengthen a basketball court from 28.65 m to 
28.65 km and you drastically alter the way people play the entire game as well.
A game’s playing field defines the boundaries and playing within these boundar­
ies defines the skills needed to excel in the game. Boundaries force players to 
develop specific skills and tactics for playing within a specified playing field.
A chess board with chess pieces can fit on a table, eliminating any physical exer­
tion needed by players. On the other hand, a football field allows players to run long 
distances, making physical stamina and endurance a key factor in winning or losing.
Although video games largely take place in a stationary location, video games 
can still challenge players physically by forcing them to react and make decisions in 
split seconds while coordinating their actions through a keyboard, mouse, touch 
screen, or game controller. Even though the playing field of a video game has 
boundaries, they can seem so vast that they appear unlimited. Many video games 
can even generate new playing areas as the player explores, essentially making the 
playing field completely unlimited.
Thus the purpose of a playing field isn’t just to define the game, but to define the 
physical and mental challenges the game will place on the players. By altering the 
playing field boundaries, designers can define whether a game requires more or less 
physical or mental effort.
The Playing Field Boundaries

30
Thought Exercise
Identify several different types of game such as a sport, a board game, and a video 
game. Identify the greatest physical challenge needed to win in each game. For each 
type of game, what change in the boundary would increase (or decrease) the physi­
cal challenge? What change in the boundary would increase (or decrease) the men­
tal challenge?
The Game Rules
To win, a player must overcome their own physical and/or mental limitations, 
defined by the game’s playing field’s boundaries. Another factor that blocks players 
from achieving a goal are the game rules.
Rules explicitly define what’s allowed. However, rules are based on assumptions. 
Originally, basketball rules did not define how long a team could hold a ball. The 
assumption was that players would focus on shooting. In reality, teams would score 
just enough points to get ahead and then spend the remainder of the game trying to 
keep the ball away from the other team until time ran out. This resulted in low scor­
ing games with long periods of tedium that made for dull games.
To fix this loophole, officials introduced the 24 second rule where teams had to 
shoot the ball and hit the rim within 24 seconds or lose possession of the ball. This 
forced teams to shoot more often, resulting in higher scores and far more engaging 
games for both players and spectators alike.
Because rules define what’s allowed, they can directly affect player decisions 
and actions. Until basketball introduced the 24 second rule, players had a greater 
incentive to hold on to the ball for as long as possible while their team was ahead. 
The 24 second rule forced players to change their tactics and their action.
Because rules define what’s allowed, they give players two specific choices. 
First, players can follow the rules (and the assumptions behind the rules) to deter­
mine the best way to win. Second, players can look for loopholes in the rules and 
take actions not explicitly banned by the rules to gain an advantage.
For example, baseball assumes pitchers will try to get batters out by striking 
them out or getting them to hit a ball to a fielder who can catch the ball or throw the 
batter out. Thus the assumption is that pitchers will try to get a batter out.
However, a pitcher can subtly subvert the assumption of this rule by deliberately 
walking a batter to face a weaker batter. Intentional walks are not usually part of the 
game, but are allowed because the rules specifically do not ban deliberate walks.
When defining rules for a game, it’s not enough to define what’s allowed. It’s 
equally crucial to understand how players might subvert any assumptions behind 
each rule. Otherwise players might follow the rules but exploit a loophole, which 
could give them an unfair advantage or create an unintentional outcome in a game, 
such as the case where basketball players would hold on to a ball for long periods of 
time after their team was ahead.
4  Game Design Elements

31
Following the rules (or exploiting loopholes within the rules) defines the actions 
players can take to win the game. In sports, referees or umpires enforce the rules 
(not always accurately) while in video games, the computer enforces the rules. 
Because the rules are hidden in a video game, players can often discover loopholes 
that they can exploit until the game developers patch the game to close this flaw.
Rules define how players can win a game by defining the difficulty levels of the 
actions players can take within a game. In soccer, the rules make the game more 
challenging by forcing players to hit the ball using any part of their body except 
their hands (the goalie is the exception). In chess, the rules define how each piece 
can move and attack, forcing players to calculate the arrangement of their pieces to 
attack and defend to win the game.
Because rules explicitly define what’s allowed, it’s crucial to look for any unin­
tended consequences of rules that players can exploit. In ice hockey, players are 
allowed to stand in front of an opposing goalie to block their line of sight. However, 
the assumption is that players will turn their back to the opposing goalie while 
watching the play in front of them. One player broke this assumption and exploited 
this rule by standing in front of the opposing goalie and waving his arms and stick 
while spewing out insults. Officials had to add a new rule specifically forbidding 
this practice.
In some multiplayer video games, players appear at specific spawn points. 
Therefore enemies often look for these spawn points so they can kill new players the 
moment they enter or spawn into the game. Such a practice is known as “spawn 
camping” and can be minimized by keeping enemies a fixed distance away from 
spawn points (giving players time and space to react) or by making newly spawned 
players temporarily immune from any attacks (giving players time to stay alive). In 
any case, video games often must define new rules specifically to either ban or mini­
mize the effect of unwanted behavior such as spawn camping.
The key to writing rules is to make them as short as possible and as complete as 
possible. The fewer rules, the easier the game will be to learn, but the more likely 
players will find a way to exploit the rules. The more rules, the harder the game will 
be to learn, but the less likely players can find a way to exploit the rules.
Every rule contains an assumption about how it affects the game so identify this 
assumption and imagine that the assumption is completely wrong. Now does the 
rule still affect the game the same way? By examining the assumption behind every 
rule, designers can minimize the risk that players can exploit a rule and negatively 
affect the way the game works.
Thought Exercise
Examine the rules in several different types of game such as a sport, a board game, 
and a video game. Pick one rule to eliminate and identify how that would change the 
physical or mental difficulty level. Pick one rule to modify and identify how that 
changes the physical or mental difficulty level.
Thought Exercise

32
Make up a new rule for each game and identify how your new rule would change 
the physical or mental difficulty level. Strive to make up a rule that drastically 
changes the physical or mental difficulty level.
The Game Opponents
In a game like Solitaire, the playing pieces (the cards), the boundaries (52 cards), 
and the rules (the player can only play cards based on previously played cards) all 
work together to make the game difficult to win. However, the playing pieces, 
boundaries, and rules passively block the player. What makes games far more inter­
esting is when other players (or artificially intelligent non-player characters) actively 
block the player from reaching a goal.
In a video game, the simplest non-player characters (NPCs) often provide obsta­
cles for players to overcome. Such NPCs challenge the player by sheer numbers 
and/or by directly confronting and attacking the player. In many zombie video 
games, zombie NPCs aren’t much of a challenge by themselves, but when collected 
in a group, their large numbers create an obstacle players must either avoid or 
destroy.
On a more challenging level, NPCs may be controlled by an artificial intelligence 
(AI) algorithm that gives NPCs seemingly intelligent behavior. Now rather than 
blocking a player’s progress through sheer numbers or random movement, 
AI-controlled NPCs behave intelligently and threaten players by appearing to 
respond to their actions.
However, even AI-controlled NPCs can feel limited and predictable. That’s why 
human players make the best opponents since every person has different skill levels 
with different methods for making decisions. This means humans can strategize and 
act in ways that AI algorithms often fail to duplicate. Human opponents can analyze 
your reactions and respond by deliberately targeting your weakness. Even more 
entertaining (or frustrating) is that human players can taunt players to create an 
additional emotional challenge to winning the game as well.
One human opponent can be hard enough to defeat, but many games allow mul­
tiple people to play at the same time. Trying to outwit a single human opponent may 
be hard, but trying to defeat multiple human opponents, who all have different play­
ing styles, can prove even more difficult.
Unlike AI-controlled NPCs, human opponents can make alliances with others, 
betray friends, and deceive everyone through misdirection or outright lies. Such an 
unpredictable element makes playing with and against human opponents most chal­
lenging of all.
Thought Exercise
A goal and the playing pieces needed to reach that goal define the physical and 
mental challenges players face.
4  Game Design Elements

33
The boundaries of a playing field increase or decrease the physical and mental 
challenges defined by the goal and playing pieces.
Rules adjust the difficulty level of the physical and mental challenges needed to 
reach a goal.
Opponents (whether AI-controlled or human) directly block a goal or force play­
ers in a race against time to reach a goal before their opponent can do so.
Pick any game and change the following to see how it affects the overall 
gameplay:
•	 Change the goal or playing pieces
•	 Change the boundaries of the playing field
•	 Add or subtract a rule
•	 Add or subtract the number of opponents
The Time Element
One factor that defines gameplay is the element of time. Specifically, does the game 
have a time limit when the game ends? In some games, there is no time limit. In 
baseball, a game can take however long it takes two teams to complete nine innings. 
In other games, there’s a fixed time limit, which forces players to achieve their goal 
before time runs out.
Time can create greater excitement because it forces players to take desperate 
action before they run out of time. Besides the end of a game, time can also increase 
play at the end of specific divisions of a game such as the end of each quarter or, in 
the case of basketball, at the end of 24 seconds each time a team gains possession of 
the ball. Time keeps players active because if they don’t take any action, they’ll lose 
automatically at the end of the time limit.
Players can also slow down time as well. In many sports, teams can call a time 
out where they can stop the clock and plan their next move. In the video game 
Superhot, players can slow down or even stop time by stopping their own movement 
so they can analyze the current situation. When the player starts moving again, the 
clock in the game starts ticking once more.
Time plays a crucial role in many games. To increase the pace in speed chess, 
players each get an equal amount of time. The longer they take to make a move, the 
more time they’ll consume, which means less time they’ll have to make moves in 
the future. Just adding a time limit in speed chess alters the game considerably 
where players used to regular chess may not necessarily excel in timed chess 
matches and vice versa.
By adding a time limit to the entire game, to individual divisions of a game, or to 
specific events within a game, designers can alter the pace of a game that can affect 
the entire experience of the game.
The Time Element

34
Thought Exercise
Choose a game with a time limit (such as basketball) and imagine how the game 
would change if the time limit didn’t exist. Choose a game without a time limit 
(such as golf) and imagine how the game would change if there was a fixed time 
limit for the entire game. For equal division of the game. For individual events 
within the game.
For games with time limits, how do time outs affect the game by stopping time 
temporarily? How does the lack of time outs affect a game with time limits?
One-Time Play vs. Repeated Play
Most sports, card, and board games are meant for repeat play. With these types of 
games, the challenge comes from playing multiple opponents who each bring dif­
ferent skills and strategies, which keeps the game fresh.
With the advent of video games, a different type of game has emerged that 
emphasizes one-time, solitary play. These types of games are more like novels or 
movies where part of the enjoyment lies in discovering a new world for the first-­
time. As soon as players finish these types of games, they can still play the game 
again, but the excitement of the unknown will be gone.
Such one-time playable games are meant to be consumed and enjoyed, but once 
you’re done, you can move on to another game. Many video games with a strong 
narrative and puzzle solving emphasis lean towards one-time play.
However, once you unlock the game’s various puzzles and explore most of the 
game world, you’ve essentially finished the game. Nobody can claim they’ve “fin­
ished” playing Go or baseball where they’ve mastered everything the game has to 
offer. Yet people can claim they’ve finished solitary video games once they’ve vis­
ited every part of the game world and completed all available tasks.
In general, the larger the emphasis on stories and puzzles, the more likely the 
game will be limited to one-time play. The more the emphasis involves playing 
against others, the more likely the game will offer repeat play that creates the same 
experience, but with different players, each time.
The reason why sports championships are popular year after year is because the 
two teams bring different players with their own stories to the game. This provides 
different challenges for their opponents to solve and for spectators to enjoy.
There’s a market for both one-time play games and repeatable play games. By 
knowing which type of game you want to create, you can design all elements of 
your game to support one type of game emphasis or the other.
4  Game Design Elements

35
Thought Exercise
Pick a sport and apply a story and multiple puzzles players must solve. How does 
the addition of a story and puzzle alter play and lessen the chance of repeat playing?
Pick a solitary video game, minimize the story, strip away the puzzles, and imag­
ine how you could play against multiple players. How does playing against others 
while minimizing a game story and puzzles increase the chance of repeat playing?
Summary
Playing a game means manipulating playing pieces in pursuit of a goal, staying 
within the boundaries of a playing field, following rules, and competing against 
opponents. Added to all this may be time limits to increase pressure on players to 
reach their goals.
Some games are meant to be played just once. These games are often solitary 
games that immerse players in another world that’s controlled by a computer. While 
this world may feel fresh the first time players encounter it, the game never changes 
afterward. This means the game is rarely as exciting to play a second time as it was 
to play the first time.
Other games, especially sports, card, and board games, are meant to be played 
multiple times where the challenge lies in playing different opponents.
The combination of all these elements define a game. Altering these elements in 
various ways can subtly or drastically change the way the game works. Even a 
simple change can have a ripple effect throughout the game. Great games depend on 
multiple elements that combine to create a satisfying experience.

Understanding Game Loops
Every game is repetitive. The challenge in designing any game is to make every 
repetitive loop interesting no matter how many times someone may play it. The 
moment a game’s repetitive loop stops being interesting, people will stop playing 
the game.
What makes a game’s repetitive loop interesting are challenges. Look at the dif­
ference between Tic-Tac-Toe and chess. The limited number of options in Tic-Tac-­
Toe makes that game far less interesting once you understand the basic choices to 
avoid losing. Once you can avoid losing with 100% success, the entire game ceases 
to be fun anymore.
On the other hand, chess offers an exponentially number of choices in every 
game. This makes chess fascinating for people to continue playing for entire life­
times. Both Tic-Tac-Toe and chess offer repetitive loops, but the repetitive loop in 
chess offers far more choices to consider, making that game far more interesting as 
a result. Repetition is unavoidable in any loop, but the key is to avoid identical rep­
etition where a game fails to show the player anything new.
In every game, there’s a core repetitive loop. In board and card games, this core 
loop occurs in each player’s turn. Each turn in chess and checkers, players must 
decide which piece to move. In poker, players must make choices based on the cards 
they have, the money they have, and the choices and behavior of the other players. 
Games that offer more choices create a more interesting experience.
In real-time video games, this core loop occurs every second. In a racing game, 
players need to decide where to steer and how fast (or slow) to go. In a first-person 
shooter game, players need to decide where to move and what to shoot at. Because 
these choices change each second, the game provides an ongoing challenge for 
players to resolve.

All game loops consist of the following repetitive steps:
	1.	 Identify the objective
	2.	 Collect information
	3.	 Form a hypothesis to reach the objective
	4.	 Test the hypothesis
	5.	 Observe results
	6.	 Interpret data from the results
	7.	 Return to step 3 to form a new hypothesis
At the start of every loop, players must know their objective. What are they trying 
to do? In the main core loop of every game, players are trying to win, but they must 
know exactly what they need to do to win the game. In sports, the object is to score 
more points. In board and video games, the object might be to defeat an enemy or 
be the first to reach a specific location. Whatever the goal might be, players must 
have a clear path to reaching that goal.
Once players know what they need to do, they need to evaluate their options by 
collecting information. Where is the goal? What is in the way? Where are they 
located in relation to the goal? What can they do to reach the goal?
This initial information gathering stage involves players evaluating their current 
state to understand what they can do to get closer to the ultimate goal. When they 
know where they are, what they can do, and where the goal is, they can create a 
hypothesis (plan) for how to get there.
Players must test their hypothesis by implementing their initial plan. Most likely, 
players will find their actions will either fail outright or simply prove more difficult 
than they anticipated. In either case, players can see the results of their actions and 
then decide what they can change. Did they fail because their plan itself was faulty 
or because they simply failed to execute a good plan correctly?
Based on their actions and the results, players can learn from their mistakes. 
Then they can form a new hypothesis and repeat the loop until they finally achieve 
their objective.
Thought Exercise
Pick a board or card game and identify its core game loop that occurs every turn. 
Pick different video game types (such as a sport game, a vehicle simulation game, 
or a horror survival game) and identify its core game loop that occurs every second 
or every turn.
Why are the choices in the board or card game interesting? Why are the choices 
in a video game interesting?
The core game loop (by turn or by seconds) defines the main action of the game. 
Make sure this main action is fun, challenging, and interesting by offering players 
options that keep changing. Either new options appear (and old options disappear) 
or the same options remain but in different and changed circumstances). Pick a 
game that you do not like. What about its main action is not fun, challenging, or 
interesting to you?
5  Understanding Game Loops

39
Identifying Macro and Micro Game Loops
Every game consists of multiple game loops. There’s the core game loop that defines 
the entire purpose for playing the game. In chess, the purpose of the game is to 
checkmate your opponent’s king. In soccer, the purpose of the game is to score the 
most goals. In any game, there are macro loops and micro loops.
Macro loops contain the major repetitive loops in a game. In a video game, there 
might be an inventory management loop, a movement loop, and a combat loop. In a 
board game like Battleship, there’s an initial ship placement loop and an attack loop. 
In a card game like poker, there’s a card dealing loop, a card exchange loop, and a 
decision loop whether to stay in the game or not. Macro loops define the major, 
repetitive loops that make up the entire core game loop.
5.1
•	 Move
•	 Buy property, pay rent, draw a card, or do nothing
•	 Collect rent from other players
Within each macro loop are one or more micro loops. In Monopoly, buying property 
represents one micro loop where players can decide to buy a property, pay money, 
and then receive the title for that property. The micro loops define the steps players 
take within the macro loop.
5.2
•	 Move
•	 Shoot
•	 Collect loot to upgrade player
 
Identifying Macro and Micro Game Loops

40
 
Within the shoot macro loop, players might go through several micro loops such as 
choosing which weapon to use, where to aim, and how many shots to fire.
Each game loop contains its own objective. Within the Move macro loop, the 
objective is to find the best position. Within the Shoot macro loop, the objective is 
to defeat an enemy. Within the Collect loot macro loop, the objective is to decide 
which loot is valuable enough to keep and use.
By defining the various loops that make up a game, you can better understand 
how different parts of a game work together to create a single unified experience for 
the player. Ideally, each micro loop should be fun to do and work together to support 
the larger macro loop of the game.
Thought Exercise
Pick a card or board game and identify its macro game loops. Then identify the 
micro game loops within one of its macro loops. Do the same for a video game.
How do the micro loops support the macro loop? Does each micro loop present 
players with interesting and ever-changing choices? If so, how? If not, how does this 
affect the game?
Defining Actions Within Each Loop
Each game loop defines a single unit of action. To take action, players need to know 
their options:
•	 Where does this loop take place? (Describes the playing field)
•	 What can the player do? (Describes the options the player must choose)
•	 How can players do something? (Describes how the player implements an option)
5  Understanding Game Loops

41
In Monopoly, the Move loop answers these questions like this:
•	 (Where does this take place?) Moves take place on a board divided into proper­
ties and random chance spots
•	 (What can the player do?) Each player must move clockwise around the board
•	 (How can players do something?) Players throw dice and move the amount 
determined by the dice total
By defining the main parts of each game loop, it’s easy to define the overall actions 
within the game without getting bogged down with details too soon.
In a first-person shooter video game, the Move loop answers these questions 
like this:
•	 (Where does this take place?) Moves take place within the game world that can 
be inside a building or outside in a city
•	 (What can the player do?) Walk, run, duck, jump
•	 (How can players do something?) Press buttons on a controller, press keys on the 
keyboard, move the mouse, slide a finger on a touch screen
The various tasks that make up the core game loop must be fun or as short as pos­
sible. If any task within a loop is not fun or takes too much time, players will quickly 
tire of the game and abandon it.
Thought Exercise
Pick a sport and identify its core game loop, its macro loops (that make up the core 
game loop), and its micro loops (that make up each macro loop). In each loop, iden­
tify where the loop takes place, what the player can do, and how the player can do it.
For example, a baseball team has a management loop. This loop occurs before 
the game plays (Where does this take place?) and lets players choose the players and 
the order they’ll bat (What can the player do?). A baseball simulation video game 
would also let players select players using a mouse, keyboard or game controller 
(How can players do something?).
Pick a board game and a video game (such as a real-time strategy or puzzle 
game) and identify its core game loop, macro loops, and micro loops.
Common Types of Game Loops
Every loop must challenge the player. Games often contain multiple repetitive loops 
that serve different purposes and create unique challenges for the player to overcome:
•	 The goal loop
•	 The inventory loop
•	 The movement loop
•	 The combat loop
Common Types of Game Loops

42
The Goal Loop
The goal loop defines the overall objective within that loop. Specifically, what is the 
player trying to achieve?
In a first-person shooter, the goal might be to reach a specific location. However, 
reaching that location would be boring if players could simply walk there with noth­
ing getting in their way. That’s why every goal loop needs obstacles.
Obstacles can be as simple as pits to jump over, doors to open, and tunnels to 
crawl through. Obstacles must threaten to stop the player from reaching their goal 
within that game loop. To make obstacles more challenging, games can:
•	 Increase the number of obstacles
•	 Increase the danger of each obstacle
•	 Introduce a time limit for getting past all the obstacles
Each successive loop must make the player’s goal harder to reach. Obstacles can be 
static, physical objects but the most challenging obstacles of all are other characters.
In a multiplayer game, other players represent obstacles to keep you from reach­
ing a goal. In some cases, other players can also be allies to help you reach a goal. 
Non-player characters (NPCs) provide other challenges for players to defeat in 
direct combat, avoid, or to negotiate to get them out of the way or even to help you. 
The sole purpose of obstacles is to keep players from completing the goal loop.
Thought Exercise
Pick any game and identify a game loop. What is the goal players are trying to 
achieve? What obstacles try to stop players from reaching their goal and how do 
they try to stop players? How do the obstacles change as the main goal loop repeats?
The Inventory Loop
One common loop, especially in the beginning of a game, is an inventory loop. An 
inventory loop lets players manage their current resources and possessions. During 
the inventory loop, players can identify what they have, which items are more valu­
able than others, and which items to use (and which items to abandon if necessary).
Every loop needs something to change to make it interesting and with an inven­
tory loop, a game must constantly give players something new to find. This forces 
players to decide whether to use the new items and whether to discard any old items. 
If the player must discard an old item, the challenge lies in choosing which items to 
abandon, never knowing for sure if that item might be useful in the near future.
5  Understanding Game Loops

43
In some games, players have the option of carrying more items at the expense of 
moving slower and getting tired more often. Now players must decide whether 
being overburdened is worth the possible advantage of having items you may need.
Another variation might give players options on where to store specific items 
such as in a backpack, jacket pockets, or in your hands. The location of specific 
items can determine how quickly players can access that item. Having a gun in a 
backpack will take time to grab if you get ambushed but if you had kept the gun in 
your jacket pocket, you could retrieve it faster.
Inventory systems commonly limit players to a fixed number of items they can 
carry, but others may limit players by weight. Thus you can carry lots of small, light 
items but only one or two heavy items.
Besides weight, inventory systems might also limit items by size. Carrying three 
daggers should be easy but carrying three battle axes would be much clumsier 
because of the greater weight and size. By using weight, size, and quantities, inven­
tory systems can provide different types of challenges as puzzles for players to solve.
Just remember that inventory management is rarely the purpose of the game, but 
a way to improve a player’s chances of reaching the goal of the game. The easier and 
simpler the inventory system is to learn and use, the better it will be for the overall 
game design. In the inventory loop, players want to feel rich based on the items 
they’ve collected.
Thought Exercise
Pick a non-children’s board game (such as Monopoly or the Settlers of Catan) and 
a video game, then identify its inventory loop. What makes the inventory loop dif­
ferent each time players repeat it?
Pick a team sport (like hockey) and an individual sport (like golf) and identify the 
inventory loop in each game. What changes occur that make the inventory loop dif­
ferent each time players repeat it?
The Movement Loop
In a game, players must do something and that usually means moving within the 
playing field. Movement is the most repetitive loop in most games, so the challenge 
lies in keeping movement interesting.
In video games, the most common way to keep movement interesting are obsta­
cles that need to be navigated around or avoided. When obstacles are other players 
or NPCs, those other players and NPCs may be moving too. That means players 
must either intercept them or plan ahead for how to avoid them. Where obstacles are 
static, they can be easy to find and avoid but other players and NPCs are dynamics, 
which makes them harder to find and avoid.
The Movement Loop

44
Even in the absence of obstacles, movement should be enjoyable because players 
can choose different movement options to express themselves. Walking, running, 
flying, climbing, jumping, and riding an animal or vehicle should all be fun and 
unique experiences in themselves.
Beyond obstacles and interactions with others players and NPCs, another way to 
make movement interesting is through scenery. Constantly changing scenery can 
make movement interesting, allowing players to explore the world around them.
Another option for making movement interesting is to provide a setting that 
teaches players how to use different movement options to navigate the environment. 
A swamp might force players to practice jumping from one log to another, a forest 
could teach players how to climb trees, a lake could give players a chance to swim, 
and an open field could teach players how to ride and control an animal such as 
a horse.
Movement should be more than just getting a player from one place to another. 
Movement should let players practice their options and explore the game world to 
learn more about how it works as well. That way players can develop their move­
ment skills in a safe area before risking doing it in combat. In the movement loop, 
players want to feel in control.
Thought Exercise
Pick a video game and identify its movement loop. How do obstacles change over 
time? How do other players and NPCs interact with the player while the player 
moves? How can the player explore the gaming world through movement? What 
ways can the player practice different movement options?
The Combat Loop
Combat is how players deal with other players or NPCs who get in the way. Combat 
can mean fighting but can also mean avoiding enemies. The combat loop is about 
confronting enemies and choosing options to deal with them.
To make combat interesting, games give players different options for fighting 
where each option lets players express themselves in a visually expressive way. 
When players defeat an enemy, they want to see a satisfying confirmation that the 
enemy is either defeated, wounded, or still a threat.
When players dispatch enemies from a distance using a ranged weapon like a 
gun or a crossbow, enemies should fall over with a different visual confirmation 
than when players attack enemies at close range using sword or an axe. The more 
ways enemies can show they’ve been defeated, the more emotionally satisfying 
defeating enemies will be.
Each weapon should dispatch enemies in a distinct and memorable style. A club 
should smash enemies apart while a sword should cut enemies apart. A pistol should 
5  Understanding Game Loops

45
visually cause damage to an enemy far differently than a shotgun or a rocket pro­
pelled grenade. Variations in how weapons affect enemies and how enemies fall 
apart with each weapon can make combat interesting.
During the combat loop, players want to feel powerful. Each weapon and each 
method of attack (ranged, close combat, hand to hand) should give players choices 
for how to attack. By combining different weapons with a variety of different ways 
those weapons affect enemies, games can provide variation so the combat loop 
remains visually interesting and challenging.
Thought Exercise
Pick a video game and identify its combat loop. What variations in weapons does 
the game offer to keep the combat loop interesting? What variations does the game 
offer in how the player can attack enemies? What variations does the game offer for 
showing successful results in dispatching enemies?
Summary
Every game consists of loops. The main goal loop represents the purpose of that 
loop. When a player reaches this goal, the loop ends. Each time a loop ends, another 
loop begins.
Inside the core game loop are smaller macro loops, and inside each macro loop 
are even smaller micro loops that run multiple times. The inventory loop makes 
players feel wealthy by collecting valuables. The movement loop gives players a 
feeling of control as they navigate through the game world. The combat loop lets 
players feel powerful as they dispatch enemies using a variety of weapons and com­
bat tactics.
Identify the loops in a game, make the loops interesting in themselves, and then 
make sure the loops support the overall goal of the game. The key to game loops is 
that they must constantly change and offer different challenges to hold the player’s 
interest no matter how many times they may repeat.

Randomness in Games
Randomness adds uncertainty in games. Some games have no randomness whatso­
ever such as pure skill games like chess or Go. Other games are completely random 
such as children’s games like Candy Land or Chutes and Ladders. When games lack 
randomness, the game outcome depends entirely on each player’s skill. When games 
embrace total randomness, the game outcome depends entirely on chance.
Most games are not completely skill-based or completely random but a variation 
of both. For example, poker uses randomness to determine the cards each player 
receives, but players can then use their skill to make the most of their cards based on 
their knowledge of the cards held by other players.
The combination and amount of skill and randomness in a game defines different 
playing experiences. Too much reliance on skill can discourage novices from learn­
ing the game. Too much reliance on randomness can make a game less interesting 
to play beyond children.
The purpose of randomness in any game is to add a level of uncertainty to an 
outcome. Given a choice between choosing a certain option or a less certain option 
that may be affected by chance, there’s no reason for anyone to choose the less cer­
tain option. Therefore, games balance uncertainty with reward. The more certain the 
option, the lower the reward. The less certain the option, the higher the reward.
This risk/reward option often occurs in sports. In basketball, players can opt for 
a close range shot and get 2 points, or take a chance for a longer range shot and get 
3 points. The closer range shot offers more certainty of success, but the longer range 
shot offers a higher reward with less chance of success. By offering higher rewards 
in exchange for greater uncertainty, games force players to make difficult choices 
that can make the game more challenging.

Dealing with the Imperfection of Randomness
In a perfect world, every option would have an equal chance of success. However in 
the real world, every form of randomness does not offer an equal chance of success. 
A typical die might display numbers from 1 to 6, but because of physical imperfec­
tions of the die, all numbers will not have the same chance to appear. This chance 
may be minuscule but it still exists.
Since few players want to lose a game due to a single flip of a coin, games often 
minimize the effect of randomness by multiplying the amount of randomness in a 
game. The chance of a single flip of a coin going against you is 50%, but the chance 
that twenty coin flips will all go against you is much less. Thus by offering multiple 
opportunities for randomness, games minimize the chance that players will lose due 
to one bad roll of the die.
Games often make players roll two or more die instead of one die to minimize 
the chance of getting an extremely low or extremely high value. Since rolling a 2 or 
a 12 on two die is least likely to occur (1 in 36 chance), some games provide extreme 
punishment or rewards. A roll of 2 on two die might represent really bad luck such 
as your weapon breaking. A roll of 12 on two die might represent extremely good 
luck where your attack hits a vital spot in an enemy and causes greater damage than 
normal. In this way, randomness can work both for and against the player in equal 
amounts.
­
6.1
Besides die, other random number generators include cards and spinners. With 
video games, randomness relies on a random number generator (RNG) algorithm. 
Just like the minute imperfections of a die can make some numbers appear more 
often than others, computer-generated random numbers are also not truly random.
Computer random number generators rely on a seed value. Based on this seed 
value, the random number generator algorithm can generate multiple numbers. 
While these numbers appear random, the limitation is that giving a random number 
generator the same seed results in the same list of random numbers.
If you know the seed used by a random number generator, you can predict the list 
of random numbers it generates. This fatal flaw means that if a player can identify 
the pattern of a random number generator, they can predict the next number that the 
random number generator creates.
To make a seed value as random as possible, random number generators often 
use the current time, measured in seconds or even milliseconds combined with other 
factors such as the movement of a computer mouse in the player’s hand. This essen­
tially makes it difficult for anyone to predict the seed value while also ensuring that 
the seed value itself will be unpredictable.
6  Randomness in Games

49
 
https://www.opencli­
part.org
Besides using a seed value that’s unpredictable and essentially random by basing 
it on the milliseconds of the current time, another key component to create random 
numbers is to use algorithms optimized for randomness. (Since it’s impossible to 
create true random numbers, computer-generated random number generators are 
often called pseudorandom number generators.)
One popular algorithm for creating random numbers is called Xorshift (https://
prng.di.unimi.it). To randomize a list of items, such as shuffling cards, many video 
games rely on a randomizing algorithm called the Fisher-Yates shuffle (https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher–Yates_shuffle). By using an algorithm optimized for 
creating random numbers, a video game can create random numbers that are as fair 
as possible.
When randomizing numbers, computer algorithms might define a range between 
2 and 12. However, this creates completely different probabilities than rolling two 
die, much like rolling a single 12-sided die. That’s because defining a random num­
ber between a range of 2 and 12 means that all numbers have an equal (theoreti­
cally) chance of appearing. On the other hand, rolling two die means a 7 has a 
greater chance of occurring (6 + 1, 5 + 2, and 4 + 3) while a 2 (1 + 1) or 12 (6 + 6) 
Dealing with the Imperfection of Randomness

are much less likely to appear since there’s only a 1 in 36 chance that both die will 
have an identical 1 or 6.
So rather than choosing a random number from 2 to 12, video games might gen­
erate two random numbers from 1 to 6 and then add them together. This mimics the 
same probabilities as throwing two die.
Remember, there are no such things as truly random numbers but through differ­
ent techniques (mimicking multiple die) and choosing optimized randomization 
algorithms, you can use various shades of randomization to influence the design 
of a game.
Thought Exercise
Nobody wants to play a game that can be decided on a single bad roll of the dice or 
turn of a card. Pick several games that include randomness and identify how these 
games minimize the risk that a single random event will decide the winner.
In a video game, what elements include randomness? For example, moving from 
side to side may be certain, but jumping to a distant ledge may involve randomness 
because the jump may or may not be successful. In general, the riskier the move in 
a video game, the more likely it will use randomness to determine the outcome.
(Video games often slant the odds in favor of the player. If a player takes a risky 
shot from a long distance, they’ll be happy if it succeeds but they won’t be upset if 
they fail. On the other hand, if players perform a move that seems certain but incor­
porates randomness, there’s a small chance that move could fail.
Since the odds are high the move will succeed, failing may be mathematically 
possible but infuriating to players who may feel the video game is working against 
them. For that reason, video games tend to make low risk options more likely to 
succeed even though this can eliminate randomness.)
Using Randomization in Games
Not all games need randomization, such as pure skill games like chess and Go. The 
purpose of randomization in any game is to create unpredictability. That way play­
ing the same game multiple times can create a different outcome each time, enhanc­
ing the enjoyment in playing that game.
For example, most adults tire of Tic-Tac-Toe as soon as they spot the limitations 
of the game. However, few sports fans ever tire of seeing the same sport because the 
game will never play exactly the same way as before, even between two teams that 
previously played each other.
Several ways randomization can create unpredictability in a game include:
6  Randomness in Games

51
•	 Creation
•	 Movement
•	 Combat
•	 Chance events
Creation involves introducing something new into the game such as new characters, 
new items (such as treasures or enemies), new actions (such as a non-player charac­
ter attacking an enemy), or new events that could affect the game (such as storms or 
droughts).
Randomization can alter amounts, quantities, and positions. For example, ran­
domizing amounts can alter the value of treasures found in a given area such as a 
loot box. The contents of a loot box can be randomized so players have no idea what 
it contains until they actually open it.
Randomizing quantities can alter the number of enemies that spawn at a specific 
area while randomizing their positions can alter their locations. Such randomization 
makes replaying a game enjoyable because the challenges are always different.
When creating video games, developers must manually design the entire gaming 
world, which limits how large that game world can be. To avoid this problem, devel­
opers rely on procedural generation where the computer can create new areas based 
on randomization. Through procedural generation of new areas, video games can 
offer new, limitless worlds for players to explore, which increases re-playability 
of a game.
When players move, they want certainty. Without this certainty, players would 
feel like they couldn’t control the game. However when enemies appear in a video 
game, they shouldn’t move in predictable patterns. Thus randomization ensures 
they move in unpredictable ways that can make a game more challenging. This also 
gives computer-controlled enemies the appearance of intelligence since they seem 
to be making decisions instead of choosing the same movement each time.
In skill-based games like chess or checkers, combat is always certain. In many 
other games, initiating combat may be certain, but the outcome involves an element 
of chance. This means that even overwhelming force may fail occasionally while 
outnumbered forces can sometimes emerge victorious.
Adding uncertainty in combat gives players a dilemma. Should they risk moving 
closer to an enemy to increase their chance of hitting (and getting hit in return)? Or 
should they stay further back to decrease the chance of an enemy fighting back but 
also decreasing the chance that they will hit the enemy at all?
Uncertainty forces players to make tough decisions. While a lucky break might 
help occasionally, more skillful players should win most of the time. Chance simply 
keeps a game interesting since players could still lose despite all the odds in their 
favor. This forces good players to adapt to unlucky breaks that further challenges 
their skill.
Randomization can also control events in games, such as the weather or actions 
of non-player characters. In a fantasy game, players might need to hire a boat to take 
them across the ocean, but if a random storm occurs, this can delay their journey or 
even cancel it altogether, forcing players to look for an alternate path to their goal.
Using Randomization in Games

52
If players transport spices from one area to another, a war breaking out between 
two kingdoms can threaten their trade route, their trading business, or even their 
lives as warring armies either block trade temporarily or permanently, or force play­
ers to choose sides to fight on. Random events keep a game from being too 
predictable.
Thought Exercise
Pick a skill-based game with no randomization, such as chess, and find ways to add 
randomization to the game’s initial setup, movement, combat, and random events. 
How does this alter gameplay?
Pick a children’s game that relies on randomness and replace the randomness 
with skill. How does this alter gameplay and make the game more difficult to play?
Input vs. Output Randomization
Randomization can occur in two ways: input or output. Input randomization occurs 
before the player can take action. Output randomization occurs after the player has 
already taken action.
An example of input randomization is any card game such as poker. The cards 
each person gets is random, but it’s up to the players to use their skill to make the 
most out of the cards they have. Skilled players can succeed, or at least minimize 
their losses, even after receiving a bad hand.
An example of output randomization occurs in many games where players 
choose to attack an enemy where the outcome of that combat depends on probabili­
ties. If the player has a massive advantage in combat, the attack will likely succeed, 
but could still fail. If the player has a tremendous disadvantage in combat, the attack 
will likely fail, but still has a chance to succeed.
Input randomization forces players to react to chance and then use skill. Output 
randomization forces players to use skill first and then take a chance that all their 
skill and planning could still fail in the end.
For that reason, players are often more accepting of input randomization (getting 
dealt a bad hand) than they are of output randomization (doing everything right only 
to still fail anyway).
When adding randomness to a game, decide whether you want to use input or 
output randomization because each type of randomization will give players a 
slightly different experience.
6.2
6  Randomness in Games

53
 
In video games, these lists of odds are not visible. As a result, players may have 
a distorted (optimistic) view of their chances of success that may not be realistic. If 
they fail, they may not understand why, which can prove upsetting.
For that reason, video games may skewer the odds. When there’s a slight chance 
of success, the video game may report less favorable odds of success. That way if 
the player does fail, they will think the odds weren’t that high anyway and accept 
the result.
When the odds are in the player’s favor (such as 90%), the video game may actu­
ally give the player a greater chance of success (such as 99%) to better match the 
player’s perception of their odds. When a player’s perception matches the outcome, 
they’ll be less likely to get upset and accept the hidden and opaque random calcula­
tion inside a video game.
Thought Exercise
Pick a game based on input randomization, such as poker where randomness defines 
the cards each player receives. Change this game to output randomization where the 
outcome of each player’s actions offers varying degrees of chance. How does this 
alter gameplay?
Thought Exercise

54
Pick a game based on output randomization, such as a sport like a penalty kick 
in soccer. Change this game to input randomization where players must adapt to 
random situations before making a decision. How does this alter gameplay?
Independent vs. Dependent Probability
Another type of randomization involves independent or dependent probability. 
Independent probability means every moment has the exact same odds. For exam­
ple, when you flip a coin, the odds are always 50–50 (assuming a fair coin). Often 
times with independent probability, people create irrational beliefs.
If you flip a coin ten times, it’s perfectly possible to flip heads ten times in a row 
with the same chance as flipping heads five times and tails five times in various 
combinations. When one possibility occurs too often, people erroneously believe 
that the next coin flip must be tails because heads appeared too often. Yet this is not 
true because each coin flip is completely independent of the previous coin flip. This 
belief that independent probabilities are related is known as the “Gambler’s fallacy” 
because gamblers cling to this belief when betting on casino games such as roulette, 
craps, or even slot machines.
Dependent probability occurs when the outcome of a random event directly 
affects the odds of succeeding random events. In many card games such as black­
jack, the odds of drawing two queens are 4 in 52. That’s because there are four 
queens in a deck and fifty-two cards available.
If you draw two queens, the odds of drawing two more queens is not 4 in 52 
(7.7%) anymore because both the number of queens and the number of total cards 
has changed. The odds are now 2 in 50 (4%) because there are only two more 
queens remaining out of fifty cards.
Each time you draw a card, the odds immediately change based on the type of 
card you drew and the number of cards remaining in the deck. That’s dependent 
probability.
Dependent probability gives players a chance to calculate their odds based on 
what has already happened. This can give players a greater sense of control and 
increases their chances of success, which is why card counting in blackjack can 
dramatically improve your chances of winning.
If you know which cards have already been played and which cards are left, you 
can better guess which cards are most likely to appear next. If all the aces have been 
played, then you know you can never expect an ace until the deck gets shuffled 
once more.
Independent probability (sometimes called white noise) makes every outcome 
feel completely random. Dependent probability (sometimes called brown noise) 
makes every outcome somewhat predictable. A combination of the two is referred 
to as pink noise where outcomes are generally predictable but can occasionally get 
out of control.
6  Randomness in Games

55
To resolve combat, a game might require players to throw two die. Since rolling 
a 2 or a 12 is less likely than any other number, one or both of these could trigger 
additional dice rolls, creating dramatically different results than normal.
Independent probability (white noise) can make players feel out of control. 
Dependent probability (brown noise) can make events somewhat predictable. 
However, the combination of the two (pink noise) can provide the most surprises 
since outcomes are largely predictable but can occasionally inject a massive sur­
prise (good or bad) that keeps any outcome from feeling too certain.
Thought Exercise
Pick a game that relies on independent probability such as a casino game. How 
would this game change if it relied on dependent probability?
Pick a game that relies on dependent probability, such as blackjack. How does 
independent probability make the game less predictable and how does this alter 
gameplay?
Look for an example of pink noise randomization in a game. How does this game 
allow for occasional wild deviations from the norm?
Summary
Randomness adds an element of uncertainty to a game. Too much randomness cre­
ates a feeling of helplessness in players since they have no chance of affecting the 
outcome of the game. Pure randomness is best for children’s games so children have 
an equal chance to win against adults. Otherwise purely random games are unlikely 
to hold most people’s interest for long unless they’re gambling such as in any 
casino game.
Randomness can occur before a player can do anything or after a player has 
already made a decision. When randomness occurs before a player does anything, 
the game forces players to react to their situation whether it’s good or bad. When 
randomness occurs after a player has already made a decision, failure can often 
upset players if they don’t understand how the game calculated and resolved 
the odds.
Randomness is meant to create variety in a game so every game plays slightly 
differently. By altering the amount and number of random events, you can modify 
the way players experience a game and increase the appeal of playing the game again.

Chapter 7
Psychology in Games
Every game must attract players to buy and then play the game. While playing the 
game, players need to follow rules. In the process of following those rules, players 
must receive some type of enjoyment from playing. This emotional experience can 
give players a reason to keep playing the game as long as possible and encourage 
them to play multiple times.
To achieve all of these goals, game designers often rely on psychology. 
Psychology in a video game can:
•	 Aid navigation
•	 Create emotional experiences
•	 Motivate players
•	 Minimize conflict between players
Aiding Navigation
All games give players choices. However, games must necessarily restrict player’s 
choices to valid options. In sports, referees and umpires enforce game rules while in 
card or board games, players enforce the rules themselves. In video games, the 
computer enforces the rules, but since players cannot read the video game rules, 
they have no idea what they can and cannot do.
Since video games hide their rules, video games need to let players know their 
valid options. However, video games must make discovering valid options easy and 
intuitive. Failure to do that can make discovering valid options frustrating.
Early text-based video games, such as Zork, forced players to type in commands 
for what they wanted to do. However, there was no clue what valid commands the 

58
game would accept. If players typed in an invalid command, the video game might 
simply reply, “That sentence isn’t one I recognize.”
Such trial and error methods for finding valid options can not only be frustrating, 
but can interrupt the game. The more times the game fails to respond to the player, 
the more frustrating the game and the less likely anyone will want to keep playing it.
One solution is to display a list of valid options so players can never choose 
invalid options. This is the method often used in point and click video games, but 
such restrictions can also limit the player’s sense of freedom.
To give players apparent freedom to choose without artificial restrictions on their 
options, video games often rely on psychology to manipulate players. Psychology 
lets players feel in control while subtly manipulating players to choose only valid 
options.
In most video games, players cannot roam anywhere they want. A simple solu­
tion is to block players from moving too far out of the game boundaries by using 
obstacles such as walls, mountains, or large bodies of water.
Since such physical boundaries can feel artificial and provide negative feedback, 
video games often use psychology to provide positive encouragement. Rather than 
restrict players through walls or oceans, video games might simply create empty 
expenses as boundaries. Players can freely roam through such empty expanses, but 
there’s nothing to see or do in those areas, which encourages players to move back 
within the playing area.
Video games often use positive enticement based on theme park designs. In 
Disneyland, Walt Disney wanted visual landmarks to make it easy for people to find 
their way around. That’s why Sleeping Beauty’s Castle appears in the center of 
Disneyland so no matter where people might be, they can see the spires of the castle 
and head towards it.
In contrast, think of a casino that’s purposely designed to keep people confused 
so they cannot easily find the exits. Such a confusing layout encourages people to 
stay as long as possible because the longer someone stays in a casino, the more 
likely they’ll gamble (and lose money).
Video games use these same principles to provide navigation guides. To create a 
sense of disorientation and helplessness, horror video games create maze-like areas 
that keep players confused. To create a sense of direction, video games often display 
prominent landmarks so players can easily see where they should head towards.
7.1
Some video games use arrows to point players where they should go, but a better 
solution is to identify certain areas in the game using colors or light. Colors can help 
guide players through the game world. Green might identify safe places where play­
ers can land while red might identify valid passages for players to follow. When 
players are navigating around a dark area, any form of light will be easily visible 
and help direct players where they can go.

Creating Emotional Experiences
Everyone plays games for different reasons. While everyone’s different, people tend 
to fall into recognizable categories. To provide a framework to classify different 
players, professor and game researcher, Richard Bartle, organized players into four 
general categories:
•	 Achievers
•	 Explorers
•	 Socializers
•	 Killers
Achievers play games because they enjoy the challenge of increasing their skills and 
completing the game. In multi-player games, achievers enjoy comparing themselves 
and showing off to others on leaderboards that rank their status.
Explorers play games to satisfy their curiosity in learning about a new world. 
These types of players prefer to take their time investigating every possible area of 
a game until they’re satisfied they’ve experienced everything within the game. With 
explorers, combat and achievements are less important than simply fully experienc­
ing the game world as much as possible.
Socializers play games to connect to others. Thus the enjoyment of the game 
comes from their interaction with other players in addition to the game itself. 
Socializers are more likely to help others and interact with them both in the game 
and outside the game in real life.
Killers enjoy competition by proving they’re better than everyone else. They 
want to challenge and defeat others, which can sometimes get to the point of ruining 
the fun for other players. Killers want to win and enjoy the thrill of overcoming 
everyone around them.
Most people exhibit traits of all four categories in varying degrees. A first-person 
shooter game might appeal to killers, but it can also appeal to explorers if the game 
challenges players to search a world for clues to solve a mystery. Such a game might 
also appeal to achievers who may enjoy trying to reach a specific goal, and social­
izers who may enjoy working in a team to protect each other.
By understanding different ways people enjoy games, you can create a game that 
satisfies as many playing styles as possible. Ideally, a game can satisfy all playing 
styles in different ways. For example, a game might let players attack enemies 
(Killer) or negotiate their way out of a fight (Socializer). The more options a game 
gives players to achieve a goal, the more freedom players can enjoy as they experi­
ment with the way they like best.
While people may have different reasons for playing a game, nearly all people 
share a common trait known as loss aversion. Basically, loss aversion occurs when 
people fear losing something more than they desire gaining something.
Given a choice between losing $100 or gaining $100, people feel the sting of 
losing far more than they feel the excitement of winning. When given a choice 
between losing something or gaining something, losing something is far more emo­
tionally memorable. That means games can use loss aversion to maximize a player’s 
emotional response.
7  Psychology in Games

61
The classic example of loss aversion in a video game comes from Portal where 
players are tasked with carrying around a companion cube with a heart on it. To help 
players emotionally bond to their companion cube, the hearts make it appear differ­
ent from all other cubes players have seen before.
In addition, players see graffiti on the walls supposedly written by other people 
talking about how much they loved their companion cube. The purpose of this graf­
fiti is to help players bond with their companion cube. After all, if other people 
(supposedly) felt emotionally attached to their companion cube, players will feel 
permission to emotionally bond to their companion cube as well.
Finally at one point in the game, players have no choice but to incinerate their 
companion cube. No matter how long players take to finally toss their companion 
cube in the incinerator, the game tells them that they took the least amount of time 
to decide to euthanize their companion cube, which evokes further feelings of guilt 
that strengthens the emotional bond the players had with their companion cube. 
Because of the way Portal exploits a player’s natural tendency to feel bad over loss 
aversion, the game heightens a player’s emotional experience playing the game.
Loss aversion is most often used in the inventory portion of a game where players 
must give up items they already possess. In Monopoly, nothing feels worse than hav­
ing to give up hotels, houses, or even properties to pay a debt. For that reason, many 
horror games use loss aversion to limit what players can hold. By forcing players to 
either abandon their current items or ignore newly found items, loss aversion in hor­
ror games can help players feel a greater sense of helplessness and emotional turmoil. 
In romance games, loss aversion can force players to make difficult decisions to 
choose one partner over another, knowing they won’t have a chance to reverse their 
decision later. This increases the emotion impact no matter how the decision turns out.
Loss aversion is partly what can make games so addictive such as slot machines. 
After spending enough money or time doing something, players don’t want to quit 
until they get the reward they’ve been pursuing. Therefore, people will keep playing 
longer than they originally intended.
Sometimes loss aversion can have an unintended effect in a game. In League of 
Legends, players were rated by their win/loss ratio. However, if a game started 
going against a team, players on that losing team often quit the game rather than risk 
hurting their win/loss ratio. This created a poor playing experience for the players 
who remained in a losing game since they’re now outnumbered and far more likely 
to lose after their teammates abandoned them prematurely.
Loss aversion can play an important role in designing a game. By understanding 
how loss aversion works, game designers can create games that influence the way 
players experience a game.
Thought Exercise
Pick a favorite game and identify which player style would find the game most 
appealing? The least appealing? Identify if your favorite game uses loss aversion in 
any way. If so, how does loss aversion influence a player’s behavior?
Thought Exercise

62
Since all players are a mix of different styles (Achiever, Explorer, Socializer, or 
Killer), which playing style do you embrace most often? Which playing style do 
you embrace least often?
Motivating Players
Every game designer wants people to buy their game, play for long periods of time, 
and play the game over and over again. The longer people play a game, the more 
likely they’ll convince their friends to play or buy items within the game to provide 
additional revenue to the game publisher.
People often play a game because they find it interesting, which is known as 
intrinsic motivation. However, they may play a game longer than they might nor­
mally do because of rewards, achievements, and leaderboards, which are known as 
extrinsic motivation.
Few people will play a game they dislike just to get a high score and brag to their 
friends. However, people may enjoy a game more if they already like the game and 
they can brag to their friends about their high score later. That’s how extrinsic moti­
vation can keep people playing games longer.
Rewards are often valuables that players get for completing tasks such as defeat­
ing a monster or unlocking a treasure chest. However, the frequency of rewards can 
determine how successful they are in motivating players. Common types of reward 
schedules are listed (from worst to best):
•	 Continuous (worst)
•	 Fixed interval
•	 Fixed ratio
•	 Variable interval
•	 Variable ratio (best)
Continuous rewards mean the game rewards players every time they complete a 
task. Imagine a rat in a cage getting a pellet of food each time it pushes down a lever. 
You might think rats would find a continuous reward schedule appealing because 
it’s predictable. Yet, continuous rewards are actually the worst form of motivation.
Because rewards are so predictable, it’s far too easy for people to tire of the 
rewards and the task needed to receive them. This may seem counter-intuitive but 
part of the fun in games lies in uncertainty. If we don’t know when we might receive 
a reward, we’ll be far more motivated to keep playing until we do get the reward. If 
we know we can get a reward reliably by performing a certain task, there’s no uncer­
tainty and thus no excitement.
Fixed interval schedules reward players after a certain amount of time has passed. 
That means players don’t receive rewards immediately after completing a task, but 
receive rewards at periodic intervals afterwards. This is the second worst reward 
schedule since players soon adjust to getting rewarded on a regular basis and quickly 
lose interest in completing the necessary tasks to start a new reward schedule all 
over again.
7  Psychology in Games

63
Fixed ratio schedules reward players after they complete a ratio of tasks, such as 
every time they complete three tasks no matter how long (or short) it takes them. A 
fixed ratio schedule is better than a continuous and fixed interval schedule, but play­
ers often lose motivation to keep playing as soon as they receive their reward.
Variable interval schedules reward players at ever-changing time intervals. 
Because the game rewards players in an unpredictable manner, players feel a sense 
of anticipation and excitement waiting for the next reward.
Variable ratio schedules are the most motivating because they reward players far 
less predictably free from time intervals. Since players never know when they might 
receive a reward, they tend to keep playing until they receive a reward. Then when 
they receive a reward, there’s new anticipation wondering how soon the next reward 
will arrive.
Because variable ratio schedules are the least predictable, they’re the most moti­
vating in keeping people playing longer. Slot machines use this unpredictable 
reward schedule to keep players anticipating a jackpot so they’ll keep playing.
Many video games use one or more of these techniques to keep people playing. 
For example, a game might reward players each time they play (fixed interval). 
Then while they’re playing, the game may provide rewards based on their perfor­
mance (fixed/variable ratio/interval). Through a combination of predictable and 
unpredictable rewards, games can keep people playing the game longer.
Similar to rewards are achievements. Where rewards occur when players com­
plete certain tasks, achievements acknowledge a player’s longer term goals such as 
completing a certain number of levels within a game. Achievements occur less often 
than rewards but occur based on the player’s performance. Thus achievements 
acknowledge a player’s growing skill, which can encourage them to continue play­
ing to reach the next achievement level.
Once someone has reached one achievement level, there’s often the desire to 
complete all of the remaining achievement levels. This desire for completeness is 
known as the Zeigarnik effect.
Imagine receiving a loyalty card from your favorite restaurant that gives you a 
free meal after you buy ten meals. Yet the card comes with two meals already cred­
ited so you only have to buy eight additional meals to get the free meal.
Because the card is already partially completed, people are nearly twice as likely 
to buy the remaining meals than if they were given a blank card that required them 
to buy eight meals. Video games can use this the Zeigarnik effect to entice players 
to continue playing so they complete any necessary tasks.
Instead of the video game acknowledging players for completing the first two 
levels, the video game may do nothing. Once players complete the first two levels, 
then the video game displays a list showing their two completed levels along with 
the remaining eight levels. Because players see they’ve already completed two lev­
els, they’ll be more motivated to complete the remaining eight levels.
Yet if the video game had simply displayed all ten empty levels as uncompleted 
right from the start, players would be less motivated to even complete the first level. 
Thus the Zeigarnik effect can be a way to keep people playing longer.
Motivating Players

64
Another form of extrinsic motivation occurs through leaderboards, which posts 
the highest scores of players for everyone to see. However, novices often find lead­
erboards intimidating because there’s a vast difference between a beginner and an 
expert who has been playing for years.
Instead of displaying a leaderboard for all possible players, games typically dis­
play leaderboards for a much smaller group such as players with similar levels of 
experience. From a psychological point of view, people prefer to be near the top of 
a lower performing group than at the bottom of a higher performing group. So lead­
erboards often display your position among similar players. That way everyone can 
feel like they have a chance to move up the leaderboard.
Leaderboards can be particularly appealing when players can compare their 
rankings with their friends. This competitive aspect encourages both players to keep 
playing so they can surpass their friend’s rankings, which in turn encourages their 
friends to keep playing as well.
Thought Exercise
Pick a video game and identify all the different ways this video game rewards play­
ers. Which types of rewards do you find most appealing? Which types of rewards do 
you find less motivating?
What types of achievements does the game give players? If the game allows 
multiple players, how does it display a leaderboard so you can compare your rank­
ing to others? How does this leaderboard keep novices from comparing themselves 
to experts?
The Appeal of Near Misses
People are more likely to quit any game when they’re losing by an overwhelming 
amount. That’s why video games often disguise failure by showing players almost 
succeeding. These near misses are rarely seen as losses. Instead they’re usually seen 
as near successes. Because players feel they almost succeeded, they feel the urge to 
try one more time.
Slot machines use this concept of near misses to make players feel like they’re 
close to success. No matter how many times people lose, the slot machine makes 
them feel like they almost won. Similarly, video games use this idea of near misses 
to make players feel like if they just try one more time, they’ll succeed. Since play­
ers feel like they’re on the verge of success, they won’t want to give up.
Seeing near misses as a sign of success instead of failure is the key to making 
games addictive. After all, nobody wants to quit when they’re ahead and nobody 
wants to quit when they keep getting so close to winning.
7  Psychology in Games

65
Video games use near misses to motivate players in combat, movement, and even 
economics. In combat, players may lose, but they almost defeated the enemy. In 
movement, players may fail at jumping from one ledge to another, but they almost 
made it. In economics, players may need a certain amount of money or other 
resources to purchase a much needed item, but they’re just short.
The dangling appeal of near misses makes players keep trying one more time 
because success seems just barely out of their reach. The end result is that players 
wind up spending more time playing the game in pursuit of this illusionary success.
Thought Exercise
Pick a video game and look for ways that the game makes failure look more like a 
near success. How does the game make you feel when you almost succeed? How 
would the game make you feel if it was blatantly obvious that you failed?
Dealing with Toxic Behavior
When playing any game, players must deal with toxic behavior of others. In card or 
board games, players often know each other and since they’re sitting in the same 
room, there’s less of a chance that one player’s behavior will get so obnoxious that 
the others will simply abandon the game rather than tolerate one person’s behavior 
any longer.
However, with online video games, toxic behavior is far more common. Part of 
that reason stems from the anonymous nature of online video games where people 
can hide their face and real names from others. When you’re anonymous, it’s far 
easier to behave the way you want with much less risk of any consequences 
whatsoever.
Besides the anonymity that online video games offer, there’s also the opportunity 
to play with people you don’t even know. With card or board games, you’re physi­
cally sitting in the same room as the other players, even if you’ve only met them for 
the first time so there’s a social element encouraging people to get along. With 
online video games, the combination of anonymity and complete strangers you may 
never meet again further encourages toxic behavior because there are no 
consequences.
Any video game that allows social interaction with others must deal with the 
problem of toxic behavior. One solution is to remove anonymity from players by 
forcing them to use their real names and possibly entering other personal informa­
tion such as their home address so the game publisher can identify players.
Even if other players cannot see the real names and personal information of other 
players, the game publisher can. Remove complete anonymity and players will 
more likely behave better among others.
Dealing with Toxic Behavior

66
To further enforce acceptable behavior, many online games allow players to 
report certain players for abusive language and unacceptable behavior. Players typi­
cally receive warnings of their behavior but if it continues, the game publisher will 
often ban those players for a limited time. If their behavior still doesn’t change, they 
may get banned for good.
By allowing players to report and identify problem players, the gaming commu­
nity as a whole can (hopefully) self-regulate itself. Even with these safeguards, 
toxic player behavior can still pop up far too often. The long-term solution is to use 
psychology to get toxic players from misbehaving in the first place.
Riot Games dealt with toxic behavior in League of Legends by disabling the 
cross chat option by default. That meant players could not talk to people on other 
teams but could only talk to their own team members.
Just this simple change reduced negative chats by 32.7% and increased positive 
chats by 34.5%. Because members on the same team needed to help each other, 
there was more of an incentive to remain positive to increase their chances of win­
ning. By simply removing the default option to trash talk opponents, Riot Games 
found they could drastically reduce toxic behavior among all players.
Another psychological tactic Riot Games used was by displaying chat logs of 
reported players so the community could see exactly what players were accused of 
doing and then vote on whether that behavior was toxic or not.
By identifying behavior that the publisher tagged as toxic, accused players got 
clear feedback on what they did wrong. Once toxic players saw what they did, they 
often apologized and changed their behavior to avoid making the same mis­
takes again.
To further increase the chances that people would regulate themselves, Riot 
Games tested in-game tips to encourage positive behavior. Using both messages and 
colors, Riot Games found that specific messages displayed in different colors has a 
measurable effect on player behavior.
Stating “X% of players punished by the Tribunal improved their behavior and are 
never punished again” decreased verbal abuse by 6.35%. Displaying “Teammates 
perform worse if you harass them after a mistake” in the color red decreased verbal 
abuse by 6.22% However, displaying that same message in white caused no changes 
in behavior.
Stating “Players who cooperate with their teammates win X% more games” in 
the color blue decreased verbal abuse by 3.64%, but that same message displayed in 
red caused no changes in behavior.
Ultimately, Riot Games found that various psychological tactics showed measur­
able differences in player behavior. Combining multiple tactics can dramatically 
lower toxic player behavior within an online video game as toxic players find psy­
chological reasons to regulate themselves.
7  Psychology in Games

67
Thought Exercise
Pick an online, multiplayer video game and identify all the ways the game tries to 
defuse toxic behavior among players. Which methods are most effective with you 
and why?
Summary
In any game, players want freedom but enjoying a game depends on following a 
constrained boundary and rules. Coercing players into following specific behavior 
will likely create resentment and rebellion. So a far better solution is to use psycho­
logical tactics to gently guide players into specific behaviors that can make a game 
more enjoyable. Such psychological tactics give players freedom of choice while 
directing them into behaviors that will increase their enjoyment of the game.
Whether players need help navigating around a game world or want to experi­
ence emotions from their actions, psychological tactics can make a game more 
enjoyable without the players even realizing they’re being guided. Psychology can 
further motivate players to keep playing through a system of rewards, achievements, 
and leaderboards.
Finally, psychology can help reduce toxic behavior from others by helping play­
ers regulate themselves. Such self-regulation will be far more effective than outright 
coercive techniques that risk generating resentment from players who feel they’re 
being forced to take certain actions. By using psychology, games can get players to 
do what the game designers want them to do while the players themselves cheer­
fully do it.

Game Balance
“The perception of balance is more powerful than balance 
itself.”
– Jeff Kaplan, Overwatch game designer
8.1
Except for simple games like Rock, Paper, Scissors, perfect game balance is 
impossible. One reason for this is that simple games can be symmetric. That means 
each player can choose from the exact same set of options (Rock, Paper, or Scissors). 
Most sports, card, and board games are symmetric where players have the exact 
same options, but even then games can be slightly skewered to one side or the other. 
For example, the person who moves first in chess has a slight advantage while in 
baseball, the home team bats last so they have a slight advantage.
However, most games are asymmetric, which means that players may choose 
different options to compete against each other. It’s relatively easy to balance a 
game with a limited number of options where each player has the exact same choices 
(Rock, Paper, Scissors). When there are a large number of options and players do 
not have the exact same choices, then game balancing becomes much harder.
In many historical wargames, each side may have different equipment and simi­
lar types of equipment can have drastically different features. A game simulating a 
battle between British tanks and German tanks is already inherently unbalanced 
because the forces are not exactly the same since one side may have more or less 
tanks than the other side.
Even more confusing is that German tanks have different advantages and disad­
vantages than British tanks. So even if the number of tanks are equal, the capabili­
ties of each tank differ. Asymmetric games force players to use different strategies 
and tactics to exploit advantages of their forces while exploiting the disadvantages 
of the enemy forces.

If one side has too much of an advantage (called overpowered or OP), this unbal­
ances the game because there’s no point in choosing any other side. If some playing 
units offer too little of an advantage, this can also unbalance a game because no one 
will bother even considering any option that can’t help win the game.
So there’s a risk that some units may be overpowered and some units may be too 
weak. In either case, players will either gravitate towards the overpowered options and 
completely ignore the much weaker options. In an ideally balanced game, every option 
must be equally useful or else there’s no point in offering that option in the game.
Game balancing is all about making sure every part of a game can be useful in 
different situations. If certain options are never useful in any situation, then that 
option either should be cut from the game or modified so it can be useful in certain 
situations. When every option is just as useful as any other option, a game will be 
completely balanced.
Thought Exercise
Pick a card, board, or video game and identify if it’s symmetric (all players start 
with the exact same options) or asymmetric (each player starts with a different set 
of options). If the game is symmetric, does one side have an advantage anyway?
If the game is asymmetric, are there certain (overpowered) options that are 
always good no matter what? Are there certain options that are never any good no 
matter what?
Balancing Quantity vs. Quality
At the simplest level, game balance is about making sure each player has the exact 
same choices at all times such as in chess, Go, checkers, or any sport. However bal­
ance is more than making sure players have the same quantity of options. In 
8  Game Balance

71
asymmetric games, each player has an unequal number of options so the only way 
to balance the game is to equalize the quality of each option.
One popular type of video game are tower defense games where the player con­
trols a handful of weapons mounted on towers while the computer controls an infi­
nite number of enemies. Even though the player is clearly outnumbered at all times, 
the player’s weapons are vastly more powerful than the computer enemies, balanc­
ing out the numeric differences.
Balancing a game numerically involves making sure each side has the exact same 
quantity of options. However when each option is unequal, balancing a game is 
much harder because each unequal option can affect the others in unpredict­
able ways.
In many fighting games (Mortal Kombat, Street Fighter, etc.), each player can 
choose a fighter with different abilities. Unless both players choose the exact same 
character, the game will be asymmetric. The challenge lies in making sure that no 
matter which character players choose (out of dozens of available characters), the 
game must still give each player an equal chance to win.
Some fighters might rely on speed but the force of their attacks is much weaker. 
Other fighters might rely on strength, but they attack at a much slower rate. Some 
fighters are good at punching while others are better at kicking. Then each fighter 
has a unique move that’s hard to do but gives massive damage to an enemy. Thus 
changing the abilities of each fighter is a delicate balancing act like building a house 
of cards. If even one character’s abilities are too weak or too overpowering, the 
whole balance of the game falls completely apart.
Preventing games from getting unbalanced is hard with asymmetric games that 
offer multiple options of varying power. Change one characteristic and it may inad­
vertently affect another part of the game. Sometimes the answer lies in varying the 
quality of each option, but sometimes the answer lies in changing the quality of 
completely different options. Sometimes the answer might be eliminating an option 
altogether.
Because multiple, unequal options can interact in so many different ways, the 
number of possible interactions increases exponentially. This makes finding the 
imbalance difficult and correcting the imbalance even harder.
When designers find a game mechanic that’s unbalanced, they’ll often increase 
its power, which is called “buffing.” An alternative is to weaken the powers of other 
game mechanics to bring them down to the level of the weaker game mechanic, 
which is called “nerfing.”
This constant balance between increasing and decreasing power of different 
game mechanics can keep a game feeling fair to all players at all times based on 
feedback from the players.
Thought Exercise
Card and board games are usually symmetric games where all players start with the 
same options. Despite this, every game typically gives one or more players an 
advantage by when they take their turns (first, last, after another player, etc.). 
Thought Exercise

72
Identify the advantage in a card or board game. How would the game change if this 
advantage did not exist? How could you eliminate this advantage?
Some video games are also symmetric, such as battle royale games where play­
ers on opposing teams may have the exact same options. However, many video 
games are asymmetric where players start with different options. How do such 
asymmetric video games balance the different, unequal options? Are there some 
options that are overpowered? Some options that are underpowered and totally 
pointless to choose?
Game Balance Is About Risk vs. Reward
Achieving absolute balance in any game is impossible. However, the real goal is to 
make players believe every option can be useful in the right circumstances. Thus 
game balance is really about making players feel their skill and choices can deter­
mine their chance of winning. The more choices available that all seem useful at any 
given time, the more the game will feel balanced. Victory depends partly on the 
game design but more on the player’s skill in choosing the right combination of 
options.
Suppose you flip a fair coin that always has a 50–50 chance that it will land as 
Heads or Tails. Now players must choose between Heads or Tails. If they choose 
Heads and the coin lands on Heads, they win $1. Likewise, if they choose Tails and 
the coin lands on Tails, they also win $1. This game is completely balanced but bor­
ing. Because the choices between Heads or Tails is equal, winning (making money) 
is more a matter of luck than decision-making.
Suppose the game changes by letting players decide how much to wager each 
time. The game is still balanced, but because players can control the amount they 
bet, they feel more in control of the game results. If they lose all their money, it’s 
because they made bad decisions. If they make a lot of money, it’s because they 
made good decisions.
Change the game some more and suppose if a player wins, they have the option 
of tripling their money if they bet their winnings on the next coin flip. Because play­
ers have the additional freedom of another choice, they feel more in control of the 
game’s outcome.
Suppose we unbalance the game and use a rigged coin that comes up Heads 75% 
of the time but only Tails 25% of the time. Now if the player bets on Heads, they 
only double their money (betting $1 gives them $2 in return) but if they bet on Tails, 
they get ten times the amount they bet (betting $1 gives them $10 in return).
Even though this game is completely unbalanced mechanically (the chances of 
Heads or Tails is not equal), the game is still balanced in the player’s mind because 
they have the freedom to choose either option.
Mechanically a game may be unbalanced, but if the rewards are large enough, 
players will accept the higher risks in return for higher rewards. So one way to solve 
an unbalanced game mechanic is to change the game so the mechanic becomes 
8  Game Balance

73
balanced (50–50 chances of Heads or Tails). A second way to balance a game is to 
change the ratio of risk vs. rewards. Now players will accept an unbalanced game 
mechanic if it gives them a chance to risk higher rewards in exchange for a lower 
chance of success.
Games of chance (casino games) are always unbalanced in favor of the house. 
People still play these games because the rewards (hitting a jackpot) seem far more 
appealing than the risk of seemingly minor losses. The challenge in playing an 
unbalanced game comes from the player trying to win despite the unbalanced nature 
of the game.
The more choices players can make, the more they feel in control of the outcome 
no matter how unbalanced a game might be (such as craps or roulette). Even though 
an unbalanced game works against players, most players will accept their losses due 
to their own decisions rather than to the stacked odds against them.
Ironically, few people would play casino games for free. Even though there’s no 
chance they could lose, there’s also nothing to gain. The promise of money makes 
casino games appealing to large numbers of people despite the odds against them.
Thought Exercise
Pick a game and identify an unbalanced part of the game. Why is that unbalanced 
part still in the game? Is there a high reward for choosing that unbalanced option? 
How do the number of choices make an unbalanced game appealing?
Study a casino game like roulette or craps and count the number of choices play­
ers can make. If the casino game only gave players one choice, would the casino 
game still be interesting and appealing to play?
Defining the Cost of Advantages and Disadvantages
Every game will be unbalanced in one form or another. Designers can nerf or buff 
the various game options to balance the game out, but this risks simply unbalancing 
the game in other areas. Designers can also give greater rewards for choosing 
options with lower chances of success as another way to balance the game. A third 
way to balance a game is to add costs.
If a particular item in a game provides too great an advantage, give that advan­
tage an added cost. For example, a certain gun in a first-person shooter might be too 
powerful so some ways to adjust its cost could be:
•	 Weight
•	 Size
•	 Available ammunition
Defining the Cost of Advantages and Disadvantages

74
Adding a weight cost could make such a powerful weapon less appealing because 
players might have to carry fewer supplies such as food or water. Adding a size cost 
could be another way to limit the weapon’s effectiveness. Perhaps the gun is simply 
too big to use in narrow hallways and corridors in the same way that a submachine 
gun or a pistol makes a better weapon for trench warfare than a shoulder-fired mis­
sile launcher.
Limiting the amount of ammunition available for a powerful weapon can be 
another way to reduce its effectiveness. Lugging a powerful gun around might dis­
patch enemies easily, but if you only have two shots, then players must decide if the 
carrying that gun instead of another, less powerful weapon, is really worth the risk 
of running out of ammunition and becoming defenseless.
Adding costs can be one way to balance a game. Another is to give discounts to 
less powerful options.
In a fantasy combat game, players might choose a sword as a standard weapon. 
If they want a more powerful pike ax, the length of the pike ax will be less practical 
in confined spaces and the weight of the pike ax might mean carrying less supplies.
So players could simply arm themselves with daggers instead of a sword. 
Daggers would cause far less damage and be harder to hit enemies, but their smaller 
size means players could move faster. This increased speed represents a discount to 
make up for the dagger’s lower combat effectiveness.
A dagger would also weigh less, meaning players could carry more items such as 
food, healing potions, or another small weapon. Thus players could deliberately 
choose the weaker option (a dagger) to gain additional benefits (less weight and 
smaller size).
By manipulating the costs and discounts of various items, designers have another 
way to balance a game.
Thought Exercise
Pick a game and identify which part of the game is unbalanced. Does the game cor­
rect this imbalance by imposing higher costs on powerful items and discounts on 
weaker items? If not, would costs and discounts balance the game better?
Analyzing for Game Balance
Balancing a game is a combination of art and science. The art portion focuses on 
keeping players happy whether the game is actually balanced or not. In many video 
games, the game is actually unbalanced in favor of players so they’ll have a more 
enjoyable experience. As long as players feel that the game is fair, the actual balance 
of the game won’t make much of a difference.
8  Game Balance

75
The science portion focuses on the numbers that give designers information on 
how well different parts of a game work based on the reaction of players. One com­
mon way to measure game balance is to identify the following:
•	 Win rate
•	 Pick rate
The win rate refers to different game items and how often those items lead to a win. 
In a fighting game, the win rate measures how often each fighter character wins. 
Ideally, this win rate should be close to 50%.
By examining the win rate for multiple characters played by a large number of 
people, designers can identify which characters seem to be winning more often and 
which characters seem to be losing more often. Then they can tweak the game to 
bring this win rate closer to 50%.
The pick rate refers to how many times players choose a particular game item or 
character. The idea is that if almost everyone chooses an item, it’s because that item 
gives players an enormous (and possibly unfair) advantage. Likewise, if players 
consistently avoid choosing specific items or characters in a game, that could be a 
huge clue that something is wrong with that item.
The pick rate for every item should also be around 50%, which means people are 
no more or less likely to choose that item. By adjusting a game so the pick rate of 
every item is close to 50%, designers can make games that feel fair and give every 
option in the game the same chance of winning.
To capture the win rate and pick rate of every item in a game requires lots of data. 
Knowing how ten people behave isn’t statistically valid but knowing how ten mil­
lion people behave can give you a much clearer view of how people generally play 
a particular game.
The win rate is not just a single number but a number for every possible combi­
nation. For example, fighting games offer dozens of characters. Therefore it’s 
important to know the win rate of one character against all the other characters. As 
long as the win rate against every other character is roughly 50%, the game is bal­
anced. It’s entirely possible that the win rate might be roughly 50% against most 
characters but suddenly rise or drop against a single character. That drastic differ­
ence can signal where the imbalance occurs.
Calculating the win rate and pick rate requires tracking the behavior of large 
numbers of people and analyzing every major decision they make. Such exhaustive 
research can be time-consuming to collect and examine, but it’s another tool design­
ers can use to ensure their game is properly balanced.
Thought Exercise
Pick a game and identify one item, either a possession (such as a weapon) or a char­
acter. Based on your own experience with the game, is this item or character over­
powered (higher win rate) or underpowered (lower win rate) against another other 
similar item or character?
Thought Exercise

76
Which item or character in a game is your favorite (pick rate) and why? Which 
item or character is your least favorite (pick rate) and why? Can you identify any 
evidence that could justify why something is your favorite and something is your 
least favorite?
The Mathematics of Game Balancing
To balance games, designers often rely on probabilities such as the win rate or pick 
rate. The easiest data for game designers to manipulate are numeric data. For exam­
ple, identifying popular choices boils down to counting what percentage of people 
might choose a particular item. Without numeric data, it’s difficult to compare one 
set of data to another.
The first step to gathering numeric data is to identify what type of numeric data 
to use. Pick rates and win rates are often defined as percentages because it’s easy to 
see that a 73% win rate is unbalanced (not near 50%). On the other hand, saying 
24,902 players won with a specific fighting character means nothing if you don’t 
also know the number of players who won with other fighting characters.
Numeric data can often be represented as percentages or fractions, depending on 
which would make the data easier to understand. When rolling a fair six-sided die, 
there are six possible outcomes so getting one particular outcome (such as a 5) has 
a 1 in 6 chance of occurring. Since every other number also has a 1 in 6 chance of 
occurring, that means all numbers have an equal chance of appearing on a single 
die throw.
Notice that stating a number has a 1 in 6 chance of appearing can sometimes be 
clearer than saying a number has a 16.7% chance (1/6) of occurring, even though 
it’s the exact same value. By viewing probabilities as a fraction, it’s easy to see at a 
glance the number of all possibilities (6).
Probabilities can appear as either fractions or percentages, but the range of prob­
abilities always ranges from 0 to 1 (or 0% to 100%). That means something may 
have zero probability of occurring or certain probability of occurring. However, 
there’s no way anything can have a negative probability or a higher probability than 
certainty (100%).
Probabilities typically identify what can happen, but the opposite can also iden­
tify how that same chance might not happen. For example, throwing a 3 on a six-­
sided die has a 1 in 6 chance of occurring. To determine the chances of not throwing 
a 3, simply subtract from 1 such as:
Chance of throwing a 3 on a six-sided die = 1/6
Chance of not throwing a 3 on a six-sided die = 1–1/6 or 5/6
Seeing the chances of something not occurring simply gives another perspective on 
the exact same probability. At any given time, the probability of something occur­
ring and the probability of something not occurring must always equal 1 (100%).
8  Game Balance

77
In many cases, probabilities define the chance that a single outcome will occur. 
However, sometimes you may want to know the chance that two or more, mutually 
exclusive outcomes might occur. For example, what if you wanted to know if a six-­
sided die throw will come up 1 or 6?
Mutually exclusive probabilities can be represented by the Boolean logic opera­
tor OR, which means calculating the odds that either a 1 or a 6 will occur by throw­
ing a six-sided die.
When calculating mutually exclusive probabilities (OR), calculate each proba­
bility separately and then add them together. So the chance that a six-sided die will 
display 1 is 1/6. Likewise, the chance that a six-sided die will display 6 is also 1/6. 
Add these two probabilities together to get the total probability that a six-sided die 
will display 1 or 6:
	
1  d i
v i d e
d by
 
6
 
p
l
u
s
 
1
 
divided by 6 equals 2 divided by 6 left parenthesis 1 divided by 3 o r 33.33 percent sign right parenthesis
	
By examining the fraction, it’s easy to understand that this probability is accu­
rate. Since we want a 1 or 6 to appear, those represent two possible numbers out of 
six possible numbers (2/6).
Instead of calculating the chances of two separate, mutually-exclusive outcomes, 
what if you wanted to calculate the chances of two or more outcomes occurring one 
after another? For example, what is the chance that throwing a six-sided die will 
display a 1 on the first throw and another 1 on the second throw?
Since the outcome of each throw of the die is completely independent (the out­
come of one die throw does not affect the outcome of the second die throw), multi­
ply the probabilities. The odds of throwing a 1 on the first throw of a six-sided die 
is 1/6. Then the odds of throwing a 1 on the second throw is also 1/6 so the total 
probability is:
	
	
Completely independent outcomes must occur sequentially in the correct order, 
which makes the odds much lower. Horse race betting uses this to offer bettors 
greater rewards in return for lower chances of success. A daily double forces bettors 
to guess the winning horse in two consecutive races.
The odds of picking one winning horse is low, but the odds of picking the win­
ning horse in the next race is equally low. Combined, the total odds of picking two 
winning horses in back to back races are extremely low, but that’s why daily doubles 
pay so well when they do occur. Someone always wins a daily double but the odds 
will always be against you being that winner.
While it’s possible to calculate and store data by hand, it’s far more common to 
use a spreadsheet. Spreadsheets not only make it easy to organize and calculate 
data, but create charts from that data as well. Visually examining data can help you 
spot trends. Then you can examine the actual numeric data that makes up that chart 
to get specific details.
The Mathematics of Game Balancing

78
Numeric data helps you identify imbalances in a game. By adjusting numeric 
values, designers can balance a game until it “feels” right regardless of the numeric 
data. The numeric probability data simply helps designers identify and balance a 
game, but choosing the exact numeric values to make that game balanced relies on 
the designer’s intuition and player feedback. In many cases, games that skewer 
results slightly in the player’s favor will create a more enjoyable game experience.
Thought Exercise
Pick a game and identify the probabilities of different outcomes. State the probabil­
ity as a fraction and as a percentage. State the probabilities of an outcome not hap­
pening. Store the results in a spreadsheet and create a chart displaying the 
probabilities.
Calculate two or more mutually exclusive outcomes. Calculate two or more 
dependent outcomes.
Summary
At the simplest level, game balancing is similar to the Rock, Paper, Scissors game 
where no single option holds an advantage over all other options. Instead, each 
option is better than others but also weaker in different situations.
Ideally, games should be completely balanced using numeric data such as win 
rate or pick rate. Symmetric games are easiest to balance while asymmetric games 
are much harder because of different starting conditions.
Game balance involves risk vs. reward. The lower the risk, the lower the reward. 
The higher the risk, the higher the reward. Every option often has a cost and a dis­
advantage. By adjusting the cost and/or disadvantage of each item in a game, 
designers can achieve a fair balance.
Designers use numeric data to identify probabilities as fractions or percentages. 
The lowest probability is always 0 and the highest probability is always 1 (100%). 
The probability of something not happening can be calculated by subtracting from 
1 such as:
Probability of 2 appearing on a six-sided die = 1/6
Probably of 2 not appearing on a six-sided die = 1–1/6–5/6
When calculating mutually exclusive probabilities, add them together. When calcu­
lating sequential probabilities that are independent from one another, multiple them 
together.
Ultimately, game balance is all about adjusting a game towards achieving a spe­
cific goal, whatever the purpose of the game might be.

No matter how well designed a game might be, games can only succeed if people 
find them fun to play. Yet the definition of “fun” is entirely subjective. One person 
might enjoy the thrill of running around while someone else might prefer the chal­
lenge of outwitting an opponent. Not all games will appeal to everyone, but every 
type of game must appeal to a target niche.
So what makes a game fun? Beyond superficial appearances of fancy graphics 
and imaginary settings in history, fantasy, or the present day, games provide a struc­
tured challenge for players to achieve. Sometimes players may compete against 
others, sometimes players may cooperate with others, and sometimes players may 
do both. In any game, overcoming challenges is what defines the fun in a game.
This part of the book divides different types of challenges, how they work, and 
why players find them interesting. Simple games may only provide a single element 
of fun such as in children’s games like tag, where the fun lies in running around. 
More complex games provide multiple elements of fun to provide greater and more 
complicated challenges that makes the game appealing to play over and over again.
Games can only succeed when they’re fun to play, so understanding how to cre­
ate fun is what game design is all about.

Chapter 9
Understanding Fun
Games should be fun, but everyone has a different idea what fun means. One person 
might like the thrill of escaping zombies or serial killers in a horror game while 
someone else might enjoy solving complicated word puzzles. Some people might 
find both types of games fun but may also like playing sports simulation games 
as well.
Although everyone enjoys different types of games, games are fun because of the 
challenges they pose to players. The way each game appeals to people depends on 
a combination of:
•	 Expectation
•	 Predictability
•	 Exploration of new worlds
•	 Choice and control
•	 Achievement
•	 Community
Expectation in Games
There are literally thousands of possible games anyone can buy and play at any 
given time. To help people identify the types of games they might enjoy, games 
target distinct genres where each game genre offers specific experiences so players 
can easily choose the game they want to play based on the emotion they want to feel.
A horror game focuses on fear and survival in a hostile environment while a 
vehicle simulation game focuses on letting players fantasize about controlling 
actual machines in real situations such as flying World War II fighter planes in the 

84
Battle of Britain or driving Formula One race cars on the famous Le Mans racetrack 
in France.
No matter what game people play, they want to feel powerful. That means play­
ers want to experience mastery over a game by developing their skills needed to 
reach the end of the game or whatever goal players might have set for themselves.
The following lists common game genres and the main emotional experience 
players expect from them:
•	 Action – Excitement and power in speed and combat.
•	 Horror – Fear by trying to run and escape from monsters.
•	 Stealth – Cleverness by trying to sneak past obstacles without being detected.
•	 Sports – Fantasy in controlling athletes in a popular sport.
•	 Vehicle simulator – Fantasy in controlling real or imaginary machines in combat 
or sports.
•	 Strategy – Fantasy in controlling a large organization.
•	 Puzzle – Intellectual challenge in solving difficult problems.
•	 Role-playing – Fantasy in pretending to be another person in another world.
•	 Comedy – Laughter in mocking something.
•	 Open world/sandbox – Curiosity in exploring a new world.
Every game genre promises a certain experience so any game within that genre must 
deliver on that experience. If you violate that genre’s expectations, you’ll disappoint 
players regardless of the quality of the game.
Consider a game with a title like “Kitten Rampage.” The title alone hints that it’s 
a comedy game but if the actual game showed a kitten tearing people apart with 
realistic bloody images while players try to hide and escape, then the game would 
emphasize horror instead of comedy. This would disappoint players just as much as 
if they were expecting a horror game but got a comedy or puzzle game instead.
Players seek fun in games that promise to recreate past experiences that players 
have enjoyed in other games. Genres act like shortcuts to help players quickly find 
which games they’ll most likely find enjoyable.
Thought Exercise
Pick a video game at random and based on the title, trailer, and art, can you guess 
what type of experience the game promises players? If not, what is not clear?
Pick any game and imagine it fitting in a completely different genre. How would 
the gameplay need to change to match this new genre?
Pick a game in a genre you don’t normally enjoy. What could a game do in that 
genre that would appeal to you and make you want to play it?
9  Understanding Fun

85
Predictability in Games
There’s a saying in Hollywood that explains why studios constantly remake movies 
and TV shows along with making sequels to popular films: “Give me the same 
thing, only different.”
Essentially people want what they already like, but they also want something 
new. These seemingly contradictory goals work in the gaming industry as well. 
People want games similar to what they already like, but they also want a slightly 
different experience.
If someone likes playing simulation games where they can pretend to manage an 
amusement park, they might also like a similar simulation game where they can 
pretend to manage a football team. When people play games, they often enjoy cer­
tain genres and play games within the same genres.
That means players expect other games, within the same genre, to give the same 
type of experience, but in a different setting. For a game designer, it’s crucial to 
study games within the genre of your own game design, and see what works and 
what could be improved.
By mimicking the best features of popular games, your own game can be easy for 
new players to learn as long as they’re familiar with that genre. By improving on 
existing features (or creating entirely new ones), you can make your game different 
while still being nearly the same. Basically, games must be predictable enough to fit 
within a specific genre, but different enough to entice people to buy and play it.
Players find fun in games they can predict and thus understand easily. By playing 
the same game or same type of game, players can gradually develop their skills and 
gain a sense of mastery, and that makes the entire process fun and enjoyable.
Thought Exercise
Pick two or more video games in any genre and identify what features they share. 
What makes each game different?
Pick two video games in different genres. What features do these two games 
share? What features are unique to each genre?
Exploring New Worlds in Games
Games, like movies, books, and music, help us ignore real life if only for a moment. 
The more we can ignore reality, the more appealing any form of entertainment can 
be. Unlike real life, games provide boundaries that define a safe area that encour­
ages experimentation (and failure) by offering a clear path towards overcoming 
obstacles and reaching a specific achievement. Games provide a sense of clarity and 
certainty that’s not always easy to find in the real world.
Exploring New Worlds in Games

86
Role-playing games let players pretend to be another person, either an enhanced 
version of themselves or an alter ego of who they wish they could be. Simulation 
games let players fantasize about controlling actual vehicles in realistic situations, 
or controlling large organizations to see if their choices could run a city or business 
successfully.
First-person shooter games let players pretend to be powerful heroes while sports 
games let players fantasize about playing at a professional level. Horror and survival 
games let players explore mysteries and test their wits to survive against the odds. 
Puzzle, stealth, and mystery games challenge players to find non-obvious ways to 
solve different types of problems.
The more a game can tap into a player’s fantasies by putting them in a world 
outside their regular life, the more appealing the game will be. The more a game 
gives players the feeling of controlling events in another world, the more the game 
will be fun to play.
Part of the fun in any game comes from learning, playing, and eventually master­
ing skills in an alternate world whether that alternate world is just a playing field in 
a stadium, a location in our own world that most people never experience (such as 
crime scenes), or a complete fantasy world populated by dragons and elves. New 
worlds essentially let people play “let’s pretend” in a structured and safe environment.
Thought Exercise
Pick a game in a genre you don’t enjoy and ask yourself why games in that genre 
would appeal to anyone. Then pick a game in a genre that you do enjoy and identify 
all the reasons why you like games from that genre.
Can you think of any game that does not create a different or alternate world for 
people to play in?
Choice and Control in Games
Games provide clear goals for players to achieve. To reach these goals, games define 
rules that force players to choose from different options. By offering a fixed set of 
options for players to choose from at any given time, games let players control their 
actions in ways that’s not always possible in the real world.
Clear choices combined with a feeling of control gives players a sense of mastery 
within the artificial world of a game. If a game only offered two choices, players 
would likely find the game too limiting. However, if a game offers multiple choices, 
then players can analyze their different options and choose what they think is the 
best option. Choosing from multiple options gives players a feeling of control 
within the game.
9  Understanding Fun

87
Even better, players should see the results of their choices. Such feedback lets 
players know whether their choices are helping or hindering them in pursuit of 
whatever goal they want to achieve. This feeling of control increases fun by letting 
players experiment with different choices just to see what might happen.
The more choices you give players, the more they can feel in control. The more 
players feel in control, the more they’ll play around to see what they’re capable of 
doing. Once players know what they can do, they’ll focus their control towards 
helping them achieve a specific goal.
Choice can be fun by giving players options. Too few options make a game bor­
ing like Tic-Tac-Toe. Too many options can make a game feel overwhelming, which 
is what often frustrates novices learning a complicated game for the first time. The 
key is offering just enough choices to make players feel in control but not too many 
choices that players feel out of control.
More importantly, each choice should feel meaningful by creating predictable 
outcomes. The more predictable the choices, the more players will feel in control. 
Games aren’t just about what players can do, but about understanding when and 
why they should choose different choices to affect the outcome of a game.
The fun in choices comes from trying to make the best choice at any given time 
and seeing whether you did it or not.
Thought Exercise
Pick your favorite game and identify how many choices you can select in the begin­
ning of the game. How many choices can you choose in the middle of the game? 
How many choices can you choose near the end of the game?
When you make choices in a favorite game, how do those choices give you more 
control over the game? How does this control make the game more (or even less) 
fun to play?
Pick a game you don’t like and examine the choices the game offers. What do 
you not like about the available choices? What do you like about the available 
choices?
Achievement in Games
When playing any game, people want to feel their activities have a purpose. If it’s a 
puzzle, people want to find the solution. If it’s an action game, people want to wipe 
out all the enemies and reach a goal. If it’s a vehicle simulation, people want to 
explore all the different ways to control the simulated vehicle while trying to achieve 
a result. In all games, players want a reason to justify their actions.
A reason gives every player a purpose for playing a game. This purpose is the 
whole point of the game, so striving to achieve this purpose can give players a sense 
of triumph when they finally reach the game’s goal.
Achievement in Games

88
Part of the fun in a game comes from striving towards a clearly defined goal and 
getting acknowledged for your accomplishments along the way. Achievements 
often appear in a game as badges, titles, on leaderboards, or by custom appearances 
for an avatar within a game to provide a visual acknowledgement of a player’s 
progress.
Constantly acknowledging a player’s achievements gives players motivation to 
continue playing the game. Players rarely continue playing to get more recognition, 
but recognition rewards players for how far they’ve gotten in the game. Each 
achievement recognition shows how much closer the player is to their ultimate goal, 
which can spur them on to keep playing until they finally complete the game’s goal.
People don’t play to receive achievements but recognition of any kind helps vali­
date a player’s time spent playing the game. However, achieving both minor and 
major goals within a game provides a challenge for players and a sense of accom­
plishment when they finally reach it. The more challenging a game, the more emo­
tional satisfaction players will experience when they finally master it.
The fun comes from the activity in the game. Any rewards or recognition for hav­
ing fun is just an extra bonus to reward players for the time they’ve already spent 
playing the game.
Thought Exercise
Pick a video game and identify how the game rewards a player’s progress while 
playing. How often does the game acknowledge a player’s progress? Does the game 
provide the player with any benefits or just recognition (or both)?
Pick a favorite video game that you play frequently and identify whether the 
game’s acknowledgements of your progress make the game better or worse to play.
Community in Games
People play board and card games for social reasons. Games give people a common 
goal to pursue while enjoying each other’s company in the process. Although it’s 
possible to play a board or card game by yourself, it’s rarely as entertaining as play­
ing with others.
Because a computer can substitute for a human opponent, video games have the 
option of letting players enjoy the game all by themselves. On the other extreme, the 
Internet now gives players the option of playing with people all over the world.
Yet even if someone enjoys playing a video game by themselves, they still have 
the chance of being part of a larger community, and that represents another way 
games can be fun. Communities centered around specific games can help people 
meet other opponents so they can play together, or just provide them with a new 
pool of possible friends who at least share the same interest in a particular game.
9  Understanding Fun

89
Popular video games often encourage fans to create art or stories based on the 
game, or even create their own modifications (mods) and levels to expand the game 
for others to enjoy as well. The more popular a game, the larger its supportive com­
munity and the more active the game modifications, making the game even more 
interesting to play.
The fun in communities comes from using a game as a social tool to reach out 
and connect with others. By playing together or simply sharing a common interest, 
communities centered around games can make people feel less isolated so they can 
find friends no matter what part of the world they may live in.
Thought Exercise
Pick a board or card game and identify how that game makes it easy for people to 
interact. Pick a video game, meant to be played alone, and identify how this game 
can provide a community for players to join. Pick a video game, meant to include 
multiple players online, and identify how this game provides a community for 
players.
What ways do communities make a game more enjoyable to play? How easy is 
it to find a community around a video game? Around a board or card game? Around 
a sport?
What benefits do people get from belonging to a community centered around a 
game? Could they get these benefits without the game?
Summary
The whole purpose of a game is to entertain people. Games do this by offering dif­
ferent ways to have fun. Players can have fun through a game that’s similar to what 
they already know, look for something different, immerse themselves in a new 
world, exhibit control and mastery over skills, strive for regular achievements, and 
join a community of like-minded individuals to create a shared experience.
Fun is relative but there’s always a way for everyone to enjoy themselves with 
the right game. To increase its appeal, games should emphasize different aspects of 
fun such as emphasizing community or realistic new worlds to explore. By empha­
sizing different aspects of fun, a game can be similar enough to attract attention but 
different enough to stand out. Ultimately, games are fun because they provide mul­
tiple ways to keep people entertained.

Fun in Movement
All games involve movement. Either the players themselves move (such as in sports) 
or the players move pieces that act as surrogates for the player (such as playing 
pieces in a board game or a digital avatar in a video game).
Movement changes the player’s state. Through movement, players can get closer 
towards achieving the goal of the game. In addition, movement can also block other 
players from achieving the goal of the game first. In some games, players must 
always move, such as in chess or in sports like marathon running. In other games, 
such as in first-person shooter video games, players have the option to do nothing.
Remaining stationary can be useful to plan the next move, rest and regain health, 
lie in wait to ambush another player, or reload or change weapons in safety. However, 
players must eventually move if they want to win the game.

10.1
In contrast to discrete movement, other games allow continuous movement in 
time and space. In many sports, such as boxing or horse racing, players can move 
whenever they want at any speed that they choose. The distances players move can 
vary but is not constrained to artificial areas so players can move at any time, in any 
direction, and stop wherever they wish.
Discrete movement sacrifices realism for preciseness in the game. In this way, 
players can easily understand the position of their pieces in relation to other objects 
on the playing field at all times. Turn-based and strategy games often use discrete 
time so players can analyze the game before making their next move.
Continuous movement sacrifices clarity for realism. Real-time, action games 
often use continuous movement to provide greater control and freedom within the

boundaries of the playing field. Continuous time puts players under pressure to 
respond because if they take too long making a decision, the game and the other 
players will move on without them.
Thought Exercise
Pick a turn-based game that divides movement within a regular grid overlaid on a 
map. How would this game change by making movement less discrete? How would 
this game change by forcing all players to react in real-time?
Pick a real-time game that allows continuous movement on a playing field. How 
would this game change by forcing movement into discrete areas such as squares or 
hexagons? How would this game change by forcing players to take turns?

Controlling Movement
In real-time games such as sports and video games, players strive to control their 
movements precisely and reliably. In sports, physical movement requires constant 
practice and rigorous training, yet a player’s physical performance can still degrade 
due to fatigue over time. In video games, players must map the movements of their 
digital avatars to the input devices of the computer or game console.
Such input devices often include a keyboard, mouse, trackpad, game controller, 
virtual reality (VR) headset, or even a motion detector. Unlike sports where players 
know how to run and jump, video games force players to learn how to perform basic 
movement through input devices.
­
10.2
In video games, input devices can be digital or analog. Digital controls are either 
on or off, such as pressing a key on the keyboard or holding down a button on the 
mouse. Analog controls, such as joysticks, can represent a continuous range of

values, which can allow finer control. When designing video games, players can 
optimize input controls so games respond immediately to their commands. Often 
part of the fun in a video game comes from discovering and mastering various input 
shortcuts or combinations that allow greater control over digital avatars.
Real-time games such as sports and video games that rely on dexterity, physical 
movement plays a crucial role in determining success or failure. For that reason, 
movement plays a crucial role in how a game works and whether players enjoy 
it or not.
Thought Exercise
Pick a game that offers movement in discrete time and space such as a turn-based 
game that places units on a map overlaid with squares or hexagons. How would that 
game be different if players could move at the same time? How would that game be 
different if players did not conform to an artificial area on a map like squares or 
hexagons?
The Purpose of Movement Within a Game
Movement defines the fun in a game whether players are moving themselves, play­
ing pieces on a board, digital avatars in a video game, or placing cards down on a 
table during a card game. Movement involves making decisions. By making consis­
tently correct decisions (or more correct decisions than their opponents), players 
can eventually win the game.
To make movement fun, games often pose these questions to players:
•	 Can players even do the move?
•	 Is that the right move?
•	 What are the consequences of the move?
Movement in games can be certain or uncertain. In games such as checkers or poker, 
you can perform any valid move. There’s never a question on whether you can 
choose a move, but in other games, choosing a move depends on the players skill 
(and perhaps luck) in whether they can successfully execute that move.
Sports and dexterity-based video games constantly challenge players to make 
moves. Thus players must choose between moves that are easy (but offer minimal 
rewards) or moves that are much harder (but offer greater rewards).
In fighting games (both real and virtual), players can make a simple move that 
causes slight damage, or risk making a more complicated move that could cause 
greater damage. The simple move may have an extremely high probability of suc­
cess but the more complicated move may have a much lower probability of success.
10  Fun in Movement

95
Part of the fun in giving different types of movement various degrees of uncer­
tainty is to encourage players to strive for mastery. The more players train and prac­
tice, the more likely they’ll complete their chosen moves with much less risk of 
failure.
Mastery involves not only increasing the success rate for common moves, but 
also in performing moves that few people can do. The ability to perform rare moves 
gives players an added advantage in a game, especially if their opponents are unable 
to duplicate those same moves.
Beyond the certainty or uncertainty in completing a move, games provide addi­
tional fun in challenging players to make the right move. The greater the number of 
possible choices, the more challenging deciding the right move.
At all times, choosing a move means deciding on what players think is the right 
move. Since the game constantly changes, the right move at one time could be the 
wrong move at another time. In American football, teams that score a touchdown 
early in the game often choose the safe move of kicking 1 extra point afterwards, 
rather than take the risk of throwing or running the ball in the end zone for a 2 point 
conversion.
However late in the game when a team is trying to catch up before time runs out, 
they often choose the riskier 2 point conversion. Success increases their chance of 
winning while failure drastically decreases their chance of winning.
The more choices, the more challenging the game. Chess and Go offer astro­
nomically number of possible moves players can choose at any given time. This 
makes chess and Go so appealing to so many people for centuries. On the other 
hand, games like Tic-Tac-Toe offer few possible moves and each additional move 
further narrows down the list of possible moves. The end result is that games like 
Tic-Tac-Toe reduce the challenge by progressively limiting the number of possible 
moves while chess and Go progressively increase the number of possible moves. 
The more possible moves, the more challenging it can be to choose the best possi­
ble move.
Being able to make a move and then choose the best possible move provides 
much of the fun in a game as players react to each other’s choices. That’s why the 
consequences of each move increases enjoyment and challenge in a game.
In fighting games, players have a choice between multiple types of attacks. If a 
player chooses a risky move and fails, that failure could leave them wide open to an 
easy counter-attack by their opponent. So not only do players risk failing in their 
move, but they also risk dramatically decreasing their chance of success in the 
future as well.
Even if players successfully complete a risky move, there might still be conse­
quences afterwards. In a fighting game, successfully completing a risky move could 
add fatigue, limiting the possible choices of moves the player can make in the 
immediate future. In multi-player games, successfully completing a risky move 
could alert other players to your risk of winning, which could cause them to gang up 
against you as a result.
Completing a move with varying degrees of certainty, choosing the right move, 
and dealing with the consequences of each move is what makes games fun to play.
The Purpose of Movement Within a Game

96
Thought Exercise
Pick a game where players are 100% certain in controlling their playing pieces. 
How does the game change if movement is less than 100% certain?
Pick a game where movement can be uncertain, such as sports like basketball or 
soccer. What happens if movement were suddenly changed to being 100% every 
time, how would that change the game?
Pick a favorite game and examine how the number of available options makes the 
game fun. Imagine cutting down the available options by 50% or more. Would that 
game still be fun to play?
Pick a game and identify two possible moves a player could make at any given 
time. Are there any consequences if the player should fail to make a move? Are 
there any consequences if the player should succeed in making a move?
What are the consequences if the player should fail in making that move? What 
are the consequences even if the player should succeed in making that move?
Making Movement Fun
On a basic level, movement within a game gets players one step closer towards a 
goal. The most common way to move characters in a video game is through walk­
ing, yet walking long distances can be boring. To make walking more interesting, 
video games offer several options:
•	 Allow users to vary their pace
•	 Display interesting settings to discover
•	 Threaten the user
The more options a game offers, the more freedom players have. For that reason, 
video games often give players the option to walk, jog, run, or sprint so they can 
choose the method they like best. While walking may seem the slowest, video 
games often provide different types of rewards for moving slower.
One technique is to display interesting settings for players to explore. These set­
tings can simply further immerse players in the game world (such as a fantasy or 
science fiction world) or provide additional clues or supplies players need to reach 
their goal. By walking, players can increase their chance of finding something use­
ful. By running, players may get somewhere faster but risk overlooking crucial 
clues or useful items such as weapons or food.
Another way to make movement interesting is to threaten the player. Horror 
games force players to move slowly to avoid making noise and attracting attention. 
Similarly, stealth video games encourage players to duck in and out of shadows 
while avoiding patrolling enemies. By giving different types of movement meaning 
and consequences, video games give players greater choices in how they want to 
play the game.
10  Fun in Movement

97
However, movement can serve multiple purposes than simply transporting play­
ers or playing pieces from one place to another.
Movement is often involved in combat. Players can either move closer (or farther 
away from) opponents, and that movement alone can be interesting since it can be 
part of the player’s strategy within the game. Sometimes movement itself is the 
combat, such as checker pieces jumping over each other or video game characters, 
such as Mario, who moves side to side and jumps on top of enemies to destroy them.
Whether movement is part of combat or not, players must first learn how to move 
in a game. This means knowing what they can do as well as knowing what they can­
not do. Initially, every player must learn the specific movements in a game, but 
eventually they’ll move to the next stage where they practice mastery of the moves 
capable of helping them win the game.
In sports, this might mean mastering throwing, hitting, or catching a ball. In 
video games, this might mean mastering the controls needed to make a digital avatar 
move exactly the way you want. First, players must learn how to move. Second, 
players must learn to master their movements.
The stages for learning movement in a game typically involves:
•	 Learning how to move
•	 Mastering the movement
•	 Understanding how to apply different types of movement to overcome obstacles 
and challenges
In video games, movement can be an enjoyable feature in itself. Once players learn 
to move and start mastering their movements, they can tackle progressively more 
difficult game challenges that involve:
•	 Chaining moves
•	 Timing
•	 Using the environment
Chaining moves involves performing two or more individual moves in rapid succes­
sion, which can create unique outcomes. In baseball, left-handed hitters can perform 
a drag bunt. Unlike a normal bunt that simply drops the ball down on the infield, a 
drag bunt lets a left-handed hitter run and bunt at the same time. This knocks the ball 
down on the infield while giving the batter a head start in trying to reach first base.
In many fighting video games, players can duck, jump, move, punch, or kick. 
Novices often do one action at a time such as move and punch or jump and then 
kick. However, each fighter can respond to multiple input that creates a fighting 
combination unique to that specific fighter.
Of course, it doesn’t do players any good just to learn any special combinations. 
Once they learn how to unlock special abilities, they must practice timing these 
moves for maximum effect against an opponent.
Any move done at the right time can succeed. Conversely, the right move done at 
the wrong time won’t help the player and may even set the player further back from 
winning. After mastering movement, players must then master their ability to 
choose any movement at the optimum time, which takes practice and experience.
Making Movement Fun

98
In many video games, players can time their different movements to move faster. 
Giving players options for moving and chaining multiple moves at specific times 
can challenge players to move in visually interesting ways that can be appealing 
in itself.
Just as movement can be an integral part of combat, so can movement change 
depending on the environment. Certain moves that may work in an open area may 
not be as effective (or may even be impossible to do) in a confined room.
Players may find they can move faster or move in ways to avoid enemies or 
obstacles by exploiting elements in their environment such as railings, wires, walls, 
or pillars. Now players can master movement and explore further advantages of 
those movements when paired with unique parts of the world around them.
Moving while taking advantage of the environment is the appeal of parkour, 
where players jump on railings and scale walls to get from one point to another. 
Similar ways of expressing movement can be found in games that allow players to 
use their environment for maximum effect like parkour, which makes moving fun in 
itself. Many players enjoy speed running, which involves completing a level or task 
as quickly as possible. Now the goal isn’t just to reach goal, but to reach that goal 
faster than anyone else. Speed running adds a time limit to make movement even 
more challenging and fun.
Movement as combat and movement taking advantage of objects in the environ­
ment can keep players further engaged in exploring what they can do in a game. 
Rather than just offer movement as a way to get from one place to another, games 
can offer multiple purposes for movement to give players greater freedom and 
expression. These greater movement options give players something to discover, 
explore, and ultimately master.
Thought Exercise
Pick a video game that allows players to walk in the gaming world. How many other 
options for moving does the game offer besides walking? If players choose to just 
walk, how does the game make walking interesting?
Pick a video game that allows multiple purposes for movement. How do players 
discover these additional uses for movement? How does the environment help or 
hinder movement?
In many board games, players move and then fight. How would the game change 
if the game forced players to fight first and then move?
Video games often let players combine multiple movements to create something 
more powerful than each individual movement. How could you apply this idea to a 
board game?
10  Fun in Movement

Summary
Movement can involve just getting playing pieces or a digital avatar from one place 
to another, but movement can be so much more. Movement can involve walking, 
running, jumping, ducking, or climbing. In addition, movement can include combat 
where moving can attack enemies.
With multiple movements combined in rapid succession, players might be able 
to unlock capabilities unique to their particular digital avatar in a video game. 
Movement represents a major part of any game and should be fun, interesting, 
and useful.
Players must learn how to move in a game and then master those moves. Finally, 
players must control their movements to do precisely what they want exactly when 
they need it. These multiple challenges to controlling moving is what makes move­
ment a large part of what makes a game enjoyable.

Fun in Puzzles
Puzzles appeal to our need for order. When a puzzle confronts us with a problem, its 
lack of a visible solution creates internal discomfort. The greater our unease, the 
greater our emotional need to put life back in order by solving that puzzle. Solving 
a puzzle removes uncertainty and chaos and replaces it with order and predictability, 
which provides a sense of psychological satisfaction.
Puzzles often consist of two parts. The first part misleads us with a seemingly 
obvious (but incorrect or difficult) solution. The second part is the actual way to 
solve the puzzle, which is often disguised so it’s easy to overlook.
This puzzle structure entices people to solve the puzzle using the most visible 
and seemingly obvious path, which leads to a dead end. Only by looking at the 
puzzle from a different perspective can people find the actual solution.
Consider this puzzle:
Two people ride a bicycle at 10 miles per hour heading in opposite directions. 
When both riders are 20 miles from each other, they ride towards each other in a 
straight line. At that moment, a fly on one bicycle heads towards the other bicycle. 
The fly travels at 15 miles per hour. Each time the fly reaches a bicycle, it turns 
around and heads towards the other bicycle. How far does the fly travel before the 
two bicycles meet?
The misdirection leads people to focus on the distance that the bicycles travel, 
decreasing the gap between them as the fly bounces back and forth. This seemingly 
obvious solution can work, but relies on a lot of complicated mathematics.
However, the real solution isn’t to focus on the distance but the time. If both 
bicycles travel at 10 miles per hour and start 20 miles from each other, they’ll meet 
after each has travelled 10 miles. Since they travel at 10 miles per hour, that means 
it will take them 1 hour before they meet.
Since the fly travels 15 miles an hour, after 1 hour, it will have travelled 15 miles, 
which is the answer.

Puzzles may be a challenge by themselves or as part of a game. Crossword puz­
zles, Rubik’s cubes, and sudoku puzzles are meant to be enjoyed on their own. The 
moment you solve the puzzle, you need new puzzles to continue playing. In the case 
of Rubik’s cube or jigsaw puzzles, you can scramble the pieces to create a new 
puzzle although solving the same puzzle a second time is rarely as challenging as 
trying to solve it the first time.
In some video games, the puzzle itself is the main purpose of the game. For 
example, mystery video games challenge players to solve a crime by collecting 
clues and interrogating suspects. Based on this information, players must deduce 
who the criminal might be.
In other types of video games, puzzles act like locked doors that block access. 
Solving the puzzle unblocks access like a key. These types of puzzles are meant to 
be solved once so the player can continue progressing towards a larger goal.
Some of the different ways puzzles can block access include:
•	 Access to areas (such as a locked room or hallway leading to another area)
•	 Access to information (such as finding and reading a diary containing clues to 
a murder)
•	 Access to items (such as a magical shield or ammunition for a gun)
The Risks of Puzzles
Because puzzles often block access within a video game, there’s the risk that if a 
player fails to solve a puzzle, that puzzle could completely stop a player’s progress. 
That means a puzzle should never be too difficult for the average person to solve. 
Some ways to ensure that a player can get past a puzzle include:
•	 Offer multiple ways to gain access besides solving the puzzle
•	 Offer multiple ways to solve the puzzle
•	 Offer hints for the player
•	 Provide different difficulty levels for puzzles
•	 Make the puzzle solvable with items visible near the puzzle
No matter how well you design a puzzle, someone will find it too frustrating to 
solve. To avoid stopping these types of players from completing a game, offer sev­
eral options for achieving access. Instead of solving a puzzle, players might be able 
to find a key to unlock a door instead. They may also be able to find an alternate path 
around the puzzle. The more options to bypass a puzzle, the less likely the puzzle 
will completely frustrate any player unable to solve the puzzle.
Since a puzzle can block access, another option is to provide multiple solutions 
to a puzzle. In chess, there are numerous ways to checkmate a king using two dif­
ferent pieces. You could use a king and a pawn, a bishop and a knight, a rook and a 
queen, and so on. So if your puzzle focuses on a specific outcome regardless of the 
exact method needed to achieve that outcome, players have a greater chance of solv­
ing that puzzle.
11  Fun in Puzzles

103
One possible solution for dealing with any puzzle might even be not to solve it at 
all. If your game makes a puzzle optional, players can choose to solve the puzzle or 
skip it altogether. By giving players the option to skip a puzzle, the game ensures 
players can never get stuck. By not solving a puzzle, players might miss out on 
additional money, weapons, or treasures, but they’ll still be able to continue playing 
the game.
If a puzzle can only be solved one way, your game can offer hints if the player 
asks. These hints keep a player from getting stuck. That way they can still gain 
access despite not solving the puzzle on their own. Remember, the purpose of a 
puzzle isn’t to stop players but just to slow them down and (ideally) force them to 
learn something about the game and the game world at the same time.
Since not everyone enjoys puzzles, another option is to give players an option to 
set a difficulty level for the puzzles within a game such as Easy, Medium, or Hard. 
That way players who want a challenge can choose the Hard option while players 
who aren’t as good at solving puzzles can choose the Easy option.
Multiple difficulty levels for puzzles can also increase re-playability. If players 
enjoy the game, they might replay it using a different difficulty level. Now the game 
will be different enough to challenge them.
When choosing a puzzle solution, some games scatter clues in different areas. 
This can frustrate players if they miss a particular clue and need to leave the puzzle 
and travel somewhere else just to retrieve that one clue.
A better option is to put all clues near the puzzle itself. That way players know 
they have all the tools needed to solve the puzzle. Now they can exhaustively try 
every possible combination until they find the answer. As long as you ensure that a 
puzzle doesn’t completely ruin a game for players unable to solve that puzzle, you 
can make sure everyone can enjoy your game.
Thought Exercise
Pick a game where a puzzle completely frustrated you. Why did this happen? Pick 
a game where you could solve a puzzle. How did the game make it easier to solve 
the puzzle?
Designing a Puzzle
When designing any puzzle, start with the solution first so you know the answer. 
Then work backwards to the beginning state of the puzzle. By defining the begin­
ning state of a puzzle, you’ll know exactly what the puzzle will look like when 
players see it for the first time. By defining the ending state of the puzzle, you’ll 
know what the solution looks like.
Designing a Puzzle

104
Once you know both the beginning state to the ending state of a puzzle, the next 
step is to define how the player can get from the beginning state to the ending state. 
Specifically, what does the player need to do?
There are two types of activities needed to solve any puzzle:
•	 The number of steps needed
•	 The time needed
The fewer the steps needed, the easier the puzzle. Similarly, the less time needed for 
each step, the easier the puzzle.
Think of a combination lock. Normally a combination locks displays numbers 
ranging from 1 to 36 and you have to turn them clockwise, counter-clockwise, and 
then clockwise again to three specific numbers. This makes guessing the right three 
number combination extremely difficult.
Instead of three steps (clockwise, counter-clockwise, and clockwise), what if a 
combination lock only required one step (clockwise) to spin the dial to the correct 
number? Since there are 36 different possible numbers, someone could eventually 
open this combination lock by exhaustively trying every number. Thus the reduced 
number of steps makes it easier to guess the right combination (a single number).
Spinning a dial to exhaustively try each number takes a minimal amount of time. 
What if the combination lock only let you make one guess every hour? In a worst 
case scenario, this would mean exhaustively trying 36 different numbers, which 
would take 35 hours (1 hour for each failed attempt). By increasing the amount of 
time needed, guessing the right combination suddenly becomes much harder.
When designing a puzzle, you can adjust the puzzle difficult by adjusting the 
number of steps needed and the time needed for each step. Once you know how to 
solve the puzzle, the next step is to mislead people.
Misdirection can work in two ways. First, play on people’s assumptions and 
desire to try the most obvious idea first, which will lead to a dead end. Second, cre­
ate assumptions in the player’s mind that they must break to find the right answer. 
Breaking this assumption forces the player to follow a completely different path. As 
long as they stick with the obvious path, they’ll never find the answer.
11.1

11.2
Puzzles consist of two parts: a key and a lock. The key is any element needed to 
solve the puzzle. The lock is where the key must go. By matching the key to the 
lock, players can solve a puzzle.
Suppose a puzzle forces players to collect three masks and then arrange those 
masks in a certain order to solve the puzzle. In this case, the masks are the keys and 
the area where players must place and arrange the masks are the lock.
If the three masks are near the lock, then players can just focus on arranging the 
masks in different orders until they solve the puzzle. However, if the three masks are 
11  Fun in Puzzles

105
 
 
scattered in different areas of a map, players must take time to find and collect them 
all, then bring them to the key. All of these extra steps make the puzzle harder to 
solve just because of the added amount of time needed to retrieve all the keys and 
bring them to the lock.
So another way to adjust the difficulty of a puzzle is by defining how far the keys 
are located away from the lock.
Most importantly, make it obvious how to find a key that belongs to a specific 
lock. If players never know how to find and arrange three masks to unlock a puzzle, 
they’ll get stuck and wind up frustrated.
Similarly, make the key logical and integral to your game. In Metal Gear 2, play­
ers must sneak into a military base surrounded by an electric fence. However, there’s 
no way to get over, under, or through that electric fence.
The solution is that the guards will shut the electric fence off at night. 
Unfortunately, the game never changes from day to night. To convince the guards 
that it’s night, players must find an owl and carry the owl near the guards. Once the 
owl hoots, the guards will think it’s night time and shut off the electric fence, allow­
ing you to sneak in.
Huh?
Note the numerous problems with this puzzle. First of all, it’s odd that guards in 
a military base will shut off a protective electric fence at night. Second, finding an 
owl as a key doesn’t fit into the military setting of the game. Third, using the hooting 
of an owl to convince guards that it’s night so they’ll shut off the electric fence 
seems completely illogical.
Designing a Puzzle

106
Puzzles must remain logical within the game world and setting. In real life, mov­
ing traps can never remain a danger around archeological sites for centuries, but in 
the game setting of Tomb Raider or the movie setting of Raiders of the Lost Ark, 
these puzzles make sense because they fit within the immersive world of that game 
or movie. The puzzle example with the owl in Metal Gear 2 does not.
Perhaps the most important part of any puzzle is to provide feedback. The first 
time players face a puzzle, they’ll have no idea how to solve it and their first attempt 
likely won’t be the correct solution. To help players gradually find the correct solu­
tion, it’s important for puzzles to provide feedback.
In the game Cows and Bulls (marketed commercially as the game Mastermind), 
one player picks four numbers (from 0 to 9) and arranges them in a specific order 
(such as 4278). The other player must guess those four numbers in the exact order.
11.3
­
­
11.4
Without such feedback, the only way players could solve this puzzle would be to 
guess the exact four numbers in the precise order, which is nearly impossible. With 
feedback, players can keep getting closer to a solution without feeling completely 
lost and frustrated.
Thought Exercise
Pick a puzzle and identify the seemingly obvious, but misleading direction that will 
lead to a dead end. Identify the assumption that leads players into a dead end.
Pick a puzzle and identify how it gives feedback that you’re getting closer to 
solving it. Now imagine taking away this feedback. How would this make the puz­
zle harder to solve?

The Purpose of Puzzles
At the simplest level, puzzles act like locked doors that slow players down and force 
them to find a way to solve them. However, another purpose of puzzles is to force 
players to learn new capabilities within the game. In this way, puzzles can act like a 
more engaging tutorial.
In Angry Birds, players must use a slingshot to fling cartoon birds at pigs hiding 
in a structure made out of various materials such as wood, glass, and stone. The first 
level teaches players the basic gameplay in shooting birds at the pigs, but each suc­
cessive level adds more complications, thus acting like a puzzle.
If players try to solve each successive level the same way they did in the previous 
level, they’ll likely fail. Instead, players must understand how the new structures are 
built that are protecting the pigs, and how the material of the structure works. Then 
using this knowledge, players gradually learn more about what different birds are 
capable of doing and the strengths and weaknesses of different structures.
So puzzles can serve several purposes:
•	 As a challenge in itself
•	 As a locked door
•	 As a tutorial
Most importantly, players must recognize a puzzle when they see it. If players don’t 
recognize a puzzle, they won’t even bother trying to solve it since they won’t know 
it exists. The appearance of a puzzle must make it obvious it must be solved, which 
can be provided with feedback.
Puzzles often get progressively harder and more challenging. Often times, solv­
ing an earlier puzzle can give hints on how to solve a newer puzzle. Puzzles work 
best when they allow anyone to solve them eventually.

Types of Puzzles
Every puzzle forces players to do something. The action needed to solve a puzzle is 
the puzzle’s mechanics. The combination of mechanics, misdirection, and a solu­
tion that involves non-linear thinking defines the puzzle.
Puzzles often fall into categories that define the main mechanics:
•	 Word puzzles – Scrabble, crossword puzzles, Wordle, hangman
•	 Number puzzles – Sudoku, magic squares
•	 Spatial puzzles – Rubik’s cube, mazes
•	 Pattern matching puzzles – Candy Crush, Bejeweled, Tetris
•	 Logic puzzles – Clue, mysteries
Word puzzlesrely on a player’s knowledge of vocabulary in a language that uses an 
alphabet. (Chinese and other language that use characters that represent entire 
words, are often not suitable for the same types of word games as alphabet-based 
languages like English.) In word puzzles, players must examine letters or spaces to 
create or deduce the right word.
Cryptography is a unique type of word puzzle that involves taking plaintext and 
following a fixed set of rules to scramble words and/or letters around to create 
cipher text. Now the challenge is to decipher the cipher text and identify the original 
message stored in the plaintext.
The rules for scrambling data are called encryption algorithms and often include 
a mix of substitution and transposition. Substitution replaces one character with 
another, such as replacing the letter “E” with the number “9” so the phrase “The red 
dog” becomes “Th9 r9d dog”.
Transposition moves a character a fixed distance from its original location, such 
as moving the letter “E” two places to the left. So the phrase “The red dog” becomes 
“eTher d dog”. By applying both substitution and transposition to each character, 
encryption algorithms can scramble data beyond recognition.
Number puzzles, like Sudoku, require knowledge of number values and some­
times simple arithmetic. Solving a number puzzle involves arranging numbers in 
specific patterns where the number values themselves restrict the placement of 
neighboring numbers.
Spatial puzzles rely on observing or manipulating objects such as shapes or col­
ors. Moving different objects in various patterns is how players can arrive at the 
puzzle’s solution, such as manipulating a Rubik’s cube.
Rather than manipulate objects, spatial puzzles may require players to maneuver 
around objects, such as racing around a track to avoid obstacles, or tracing a path 
through a maze. Solving a spatial puzzle involves understanding the position of 
multiple objects.
Pattern matching puzzles are a variation of spatial puzzles except they rely on 
identifying patterns among shapes. The challenge often involves spotting patterns 
within a limited time frame. If players fail to spot a pattern, the opportunity will be 
lost for good, such as trying to manipulate geometric shapes in Tetris before they hit 
11  Fun in Puzzles

another object and stop moving. One common pattern matching feature is called 
Match 3, which gets its name because players often have to match three simi­
lar items.
Puzzles may combine features. Tetris is a pattern matching puzzle that involves 
spatial puzzle features. Scrabble is a word puzzle that also involves spatial puzzle 
features. In video games, puzzles often involve spatial challenges in either moving 
a character to the right position or moving one or more objects in a specific pattern.
Logic puzzles provide information and define relationships between separate 
items to force players to deduce facts using a process of elimination. Such logic 
puzzles define detective mysteries that challenge players to gather clues and use this 
knowledge to identify the criminal among several suspects. Logic puzzles, such as 
in Myst, also define mysteries that force players to search for clues to determine 
what’s going on, where they might be, or who they can trust in a completely 
unknown environment.
The difficulty of logic puzzles depends on two items:
•	 The number of facts provided
•	 The number of relationships possible
When the number of facts provided is small, the logic puzzle is easier to solve. 
Suppose someone showed you a red ball and a blue ball and then dropped both balls 
in a bag. If you pull out the red ball, you can easily conclude that the ball remaining 
in the bag must be blue. In this case, the number of facts is 2 (red or blue) and the 
number of relationships is 2 (a ball is either in the bag or out of the bag).
Logic puzzles get more challenging when the number of facts increase. Suppose 
there are now 20 blue balls and 10 red balls in a bag. Each time you can pull out two 
balls at a time. If they’re the same color, add a blue ball to the bag. If they’re differ­
ent colors, add a red ball to the bag. What will be the color of the last ball left in 
the bag?
Note: Assume you have a big supply of Blue and Red balls for this purpose. 
When you take the two balls out, you don’t put them back in, so the number of balls 
in the bag keeps decreasing. (Answer: A blue ball.)
When the number of relationships between facts increases, players must use 
known facts and relationships to deduce additional facts, which is the basis for solv­
ing mysteries. Suppose Bob, Alice, and Selina hold the position of CEO, engineer, 
and secretary in a company, but not necessarily in that order. The secretary is an 
only child and earns the least. Selina, who is married to Bob’s brother, earns more 
than the engineer. What position does each person hold?
(Answer: Bob = engineer, Alice = secretary, Selina = CEO)
Logic puzzles require players to juggle multiple chunks of seemingly unrelated 
information and use this information to discover new facts, which can then be used 
to uncover more facts until players eventually find the right answer. Logic puzzles 
give players all the information they need so they can either find the answer through 
deduction or exhaustively test all possibilities until they find the right answer.

When designing puzzles for your game idea, keep in mind that word puzzles are 
the most limiting since they’re not playable the same way in different languages. As 
a result, word puzzles are the hardest to translate for a global market.
Spatial and pattern matching puzzles are usually best for reaching a universal 
audience since everyone can understand colors, shapes and positions. The best puz­
zles are those that offer simple rules that spawn a nearly limitless number of combi­
nations to play.
Thought Exercise
Pick a puzzle and identify the puzzle type (word, logic, spatial, etc.). What makes 
this puzzle appealing and challenging?
Summary
Designing puzzles can almost be a puzzle in itself. When creating puzzles for others 
to solve, identify the solution to your puzzle and the starting state of that puzzle. 
Then make sure there’s one or more possible solutions to get from the starting state 
to the solution.
Ideally, the solution should be integral to the game and teach players additional 
capabilities they can use in later parts of the game. Once you’ve created one or more 
solutions, focus on misleading players so they look for an obvious solution that will 
lead them to a dead end.
Consider how to help players if they get stuck solving the puzzle. Will you pro­
vide hints? Adjustable difficulty levels? Ways to solve the puzzle another way? You 
must make sure puzzles don’t stop progress completely or players will get frustrated.
Spatial and pattern matching puzzles can appeal to the widest possible audience 
since they do not rely on knowledge of language like word puzzles. Logic puzzles 
can eventually be solved by everyone as long as they take enough time. The best 
puzzles are the ones that challenge players, provide feedback to guide players, and 
offer multiple solutions so players of all skill levels can ultimately find a solution.

Chapter 12
Fun in Combat
Combat directly attacks enemies and opponents to stop them from attacking you or 
keeping you from achieving your goals. Combat can range from simply making 
enemies disappear to showing blood squirting out of open wounds in slow motion 
as you tear their heads off for a final killing blow.
Even in romance games, there’s combat where a player might strive to win over 
a love interest while other characters may try to block this goal (or convince the 
player to fall in love with them instead). Whatever form combat may take in a game, 
its whole purpose is to clear enemies from the playing field. On an emotional level, 
combat is meant to make players feel powerful.
In some games, such as first-person shooters, combat represents the main appeal 
of the game. In other games, such as stealth or horror games, players must actually 
avoid combat as much as possible to win. Some games, such as realistic simula­
tions, may not appear to offer any combat at all. Yet even in simulation games, there 
is still a form of combat where players must make decisions to overcome obstacles 
or opponents in their way. Any time an enemy tries to keep a player from achieving 
a goal, there’s conflict and that creates some form of combat.
The essence of combat lies in choice. Players must choose:
•	 Which enemy to hit
•	 Where to position themselves
•	 Which attack to use
•	 When to attack
•	 How to react against enemy attacks
The more choices players have, the more interesting combat will be. Think of com­
bat as a puzzle that forces players to maximize their odds of success by using:
•	 Their arsenal
•	 Their positioning
•	 Their environment
•	 Their skill

The Weapons Arsenal
To increase the appeal of combat, games typically give players options for choosing 
one or more weapons. Now the challenge lies in choosing the best weapon based on 
the player’s playing style and the pros and cons inherent in every weapon. Some 
weapons can attack from a distance (crossbow, rifle, hand grenade) while other 
weapons are meant for close combat fighting (axe, fists, club).
Some weapons can be used with one hand (club, pistol, whip) while others 
require two hands (broadsword, heavy machine gun, bow). Some weapons inflict 
massive damage but take time to prepare, manipulate, or reload (cannons, chainsaw, 
flamethrower) while others inflict low amounts of damage but can be used in rapid 
succession (dagger, brass knuckles, feet).
When designing combat in a game, ask the following questions:
•	 How many ways can a player attack enemies?
•	 How do different enemies respond to each type of attack?
The more ways a player can attack an enemy, the more choices the player must 
make to choose the best type of attack. Initially, player need to learn a basic way to 
attack, but that type of attack should never work on all types of enemies. As players 
encounter different types of enemies, they’ll be forced to learn other ways to attack.
In Super Mario Brothers, players fight enemies by jumping on their heads. 
However, some enemies have spikes on their backs, which actually hurt players if 
they jump on them. Now players must learn and use a different way to attack these 
spiked enemies since jumping on them will no longer work.
In many first-person shooters, players can carry a variety of weapons, but the 
tradeoff involves being able to carry a limited number of weapons and ammunition. 
Then players must decide on the right mix of weapons to take and eventually learn 
which weapons work best on different enemies. The fun in combat comes from 
deciding the best weapon to use at any given time.
Thought Exercise
Pick an action video game and identify all the different weapons players can choose 
to attack an enemy. What are the pros and cons of each weapon?
Pick a video game that does not emphasize combat such as a horror, stealth, or 
simulation game. What are different ways players can still attack enemies?
Positioning for Combat
Choosing from an arsenal of weapons can be like a kid choosing which sweets to eat 
in a candy store. Yet another challenge in combat involves moving within the game 
to advance or retreat from enemies.
12  Fun in Combat

113
Advancing can be as simple as charging straight towards an enemy, or as compli­
cated as maneuvering around a playing field to get in the best position possible 
before attacking an enemy. Retreating could be just running quickly away from an 
enemy, or it could involve retreating, attacking, then retreating some more.
Combat often involves various distances. Ranged combat allows players to attack 
with much less chance of getting hurt in return. Ranged combat might involve guns, 
crossbows, thrown spears, or magic spells that throw fireballs.
Close combat forces players to stand in front of an enemy and hit using weapons 
like swords, clubs, or staffs. With close combat, players increase their chance of 
hitting the enemy but with the risk that the enemy also has a greater chance of hit­
ting back.
Similar to close combat is hand to hand combat, which involves attacking an 
enemy by punching, kicking, or wrestling. Unlike close combat where players can 
often attack (or defend against) multiple enemies, hand to hand combat generally 
allows players to attack a single enemy at a time, which can make them vulnerable 
to attacks from other nearby enemies.
Positioning can involve changing the distance between the player and an enemy, 
but positioning can also mean where the player is in relation to the enemy. If the 
player attacks an enemy from the front, there will be less chance of success (because 
the enemy can see the player) than if the player attacks from behind (where the 
enemy might not see the player until it’s too late).
Players might also position themselves towards the side to attack an enemy or 
position themselves vertically such as in a tree or on the third floor of a building so 
they can shoot down on enemies. Positioning gives players a way to increase their 
odds of successfully attacking an enemy while minimizing the chance that the 
enemy can defend or fight back.
A player’s position can also be important for defense. In close combat, a player 
might duck, dodge, or jump to avoid getting hit. In ranged combat, a player can 
duck behind obstacles to avoid being seen and hit, and then move to get in a more 
favorable position to attack.
Fighting games often emphasize finishing moves to knock out an enemy using 
dramatically stylistic gestures. Such finishing moves further immerse the player in 
the gameplay experience even if that movement serves little practical use in 
the game.
Movement can be a way to position players to a more advantageous location to 
attack, move the player away from danger, or simply let players enjoy the aesthetic 
experience of moving with visual flair. Since players will spend more time moving 
than fighting, games must make moving intuitive and emotionally satisfying as well 
practical.
In any video game, identify the core movement that players do most often during 
combat. Make sure this core movement by itself is fun and interesting, then add 
variation to this core movement.
In Angry Birds, the core movement is simply shooting birds through the air using 
a slingshot. Players can adjust the angle and velocity that defines how the birds fly 
through the air to knock down targets. Once players learn and master this core 
Positioning for Combat

114
movement, variations give players a choice of which birds to shoot (who all have 
different abilities), but the core movement remains the same (adjusting angles and 
velocities).
Thought Exercise
Pick a simple video game and identify all the ways players can control movement. 
What makes movement fun and interesting?
Pick a more complex video game (such as a AAA title) and identify all the ways 
players can control movement. Are there ways to move in a AAA game title that 
could be adopted for a much simpler casual video game? Are there ways to move in 
a AAA game title that could not be easily duplicated in a simpler casual video game?
In any video game, what’s the core movement that players do most often? What 
variations in this core movement does the game offer?
Fighting in Different Environments
Almost every game contains different settings. Within a single game, players might 
go from an open field to an isolated dungeon to a bustling city. Different settings 
exist not just for variety but because they provide different challenges. Specifically, 
each setting provides different ways for players to fight.
In an open field, ranged combat might dominate since players can attack enemies 
from a distance. Move players into the narrow confines of a subway station and this 
forces combat to occur in shorter distances because players have less room to 
maneuver. However, a subway can provide different ways for players to take advan­
tage of their surroundings such as hiding behind pillars, knocking over trash cans to 
use as weapons, or pushing enemies in front of moving subway trains.
Terrain plays a crucial role in combat. Rivers and mountains keep players from 
moving in certain areas, forcing combat within a smaller range. Mud or sand can 
restrict movement, making fighting more difficult while forests provide plenty of 
cover for players to hide behind to set ambushes.
Every setting should provide new challenges that both limits and increases the 
available choices players can fight. Each new environment introduces players to 
additional ways to fight. Knowing more ways to fight increases the game challenge 
as players must master all the different combat options against different enemies in 
ever changing environments.
12  Fun in Combat

115
Thought Exercise
Pick a video game and identify at least three different environments that players 
visit. What advantages does each new setting provide players for movement? What 
disadvantages does each new setting create that inhibits movement?
If a game offers different environments that do not alter combat in any way, what 
is the purpose of having a different setting?
Using Skill in Combat
Beginners must always learn how to fight in a game. Once players learn the basics, 
the next step is to master these various combat options. Skill in combat involves:
•	 Precision
•	 Timing
•	 Speed
Precision means aiming (with ranged weapons) or striking specific parts of a target 
in close combat (such as stabbing a vulnerable spot on an enemy). By aiming an 
attack, players can hit weak spots and cause more damage than normal.
Timing means attacking at the optimal moment. In many fighting games, per­
forming a fighting move too soon gives away your intentions, allowing an enemy to 
retreat or defend against the attack. On the other hand, performing a fighting move 
too late will likely miss or make the player vulnerable to a counter attack. Timing 
means choosing the right moment to strike with the right combat option. Get the 
timing wrong and there’s a chance the attack won’t succeed at all, or may even leave 
players vulnerable to a counter attack.
Related to timing is speed. Attacking an enemy in rapid succession increases the 
chance of landing a blow, but at the risk of expending too much energy or ammuni­
tion. Attacking an enemy slowly increases the chance of hitting accurately, but risks 
getting hit in return before even getting a chance to attack.
Combat skill focuses on both attack and defense. On defense, players can block, 
parry, or dodge attacks. Defense isn’t just about avoiding or minimizing attacks, but 
in setting yourself up for a counter attack.
Enemies in a game serve several purposes:
•	 Block a player’s progress towards a goal
•	 Test the player’s offensive skills
•	 Test the player’s defensive skills
Different enemies offer different challenges to players. More versatile enemies can 
adapt to a player’s behavior to force players to change their methods of attack and 
defense so gameplay doesn’t become repetitive and dull over time.
Using Skill in Combat

116
In some cases, players can actually use enemies to help them in some way. In 2D 
platform games, players can often jump on top of enemies to help them reach 
heights they wouldn’t be able to reach otherwise. Discovering how to exploit ene­
mies rather than destroy them can be another way to make combat interesting and 
challenging.
Players can develop skill in precision, timing, and speed so they choose the right 
combat option at the right time and use it to cause the maximum amount of damage. 
Precision, timing, and speed can also be used to develop defensive skills in a game 
as well. When players feel that their skill can give them greater control over the 
game, they’ll find the game more enjoyable to play.
Thought Exercise
Pick a children’s game that relies entirely on luck. Notice how your knowledge of 
the game has no effect on the game. Now pick a video game that relies on fast 
reflexes and physical dexterity. Notice that in the beginning, novices are at a disad­
vantage because they’re still learning to control the game. However as players gain 
more experience and skill, they can develop greater control over the game outcome. 
How does the video game accommodate novices playing with more experienced 
players (if it does at all)?
Creating Depth in Combat
There should never be a single dominant strategy that defeats enemies every time or 
else players will simply choose that one method. Any type of repetitive gameplay 
will create a dull game.
To make combat exciting and challenging, players must constantly be challenged 
in several ways:
•	 Different enemies that must be attacked in different ways
•	 Different environments that force players to adapt different combat strategies
•	 Enemies that change behavior based on the player’s actions
Enemies must always challenge the player. Early enemies can teach players basic 
combat moves while later enemies can teach players more complicated types of 
attacks. By constantly varying the skills players need to defeat enemies, a game can 
increase tension and gradually ramp up the difficulty level without overwhelming 
the player.
Besides challenging players with enemies of different abilities, games must also 
challenge players with different environments. This forces players to learn new 
ways to move and fight as they encounter new types of terrain and obstacles. 
12  Fun in Combat

117
Combined with fighting different enemies, new terrain keeps combat challenging so 
players must keep learning what they can do to survive and eventually thrive.
As players learn how to defeat enemies, those enemies can further challenge 
players by altering their behavior as well. Attacks that previously worked on one 
type of enemy may suddenly fail to work or work less effectively in a new situation. 
An enemy might change their movement, defense, and attack strategies to force the 
player to adapt to this new behavior.
Ultimately games can make combat satisfying by letting players feel in control. 
That means giving players choices for how to fight. If there’s only one way to defeat 
an enemy, the game may be exciting until players discover this one solution. After 
that, the game won’t feel as exciting anymore.
Ideally, games should offer a wide variety of combat options that test the player’s 
knowledge and mastery. Knowing all available combat options challenges the player 
to understand the pros and cons of each option. Then players must learn when to use 
a specific combat option for each situation. This combination of facing different 
enemies and environments, while trying to choose the best combat option, keeps a 
game challenging.
Strategy forces players to evaluate their enemies and environment. Tactics forces 
players to choose the best combat option to defeat their enemies in that particular 
situation.
The best games don’t overwhelm players with too many combat options, but 
offer a handful of options with subtle variations. Ideally, all combat options should 
be easy to learn but difficult to master.
In chess, it’s relatively easy to teach novices how the different chess pieces move. 
However, it can take a lifetime to master how to move these various pieces in a 
coordinated attack and defense.
Board games need simple rules to make it easy to attract new players. Wargames 
often sacrificed simplicity for complexity to provide greater realism. Thus learning 
the rules to play many wargames required reading thick rule books that discouraged 
many people from even playing.
Even though video games mask much of the complexity in rules, they too need 
to make combat options simple to understand but difficult to master. One way video 
games do this is by allowing players to chain multiple, basic moves together to cre­
ate a unique attack or defense ability that no single combat option can offer.
Fighting games like Street Fighter or Mortal Kombat give each player unique 
moves that players must master for that particular character. Thus the challenge lies 
in not only learning each unique move and using it at the right time, but defending 
against the unique moves of other players as well.
Suppose a game offers players just two options for combat. This makes learning 
to fight easy, but ultimately repetitive and dull. Now give each option just three dif­
ferent variations and suddenly the number of choices increases from 21 (2) to 23 (8) 
possible options.
In other words, what makes combat challenging isn’t just the number of fighting 
options available, but the number of variations for each combat options. The more 
Creating Depth in Combat

118
combat option variations, the more interesting and challenging the game can be as 
players strive to master the best time to use each possible variation.
The more combat options available, the more players can express themselves 
within the game. Some players might prefer a more conservative approach to com­
bat while others might embrace a wilder combat style. The key is that neither 
approach is right or wrong but dependent on the situation and the player’s choices 
at the time. This provides players with a nearly endless amount of challenges for 
fighting.
Thought Exercise
Pick a video game that offers minimal choices for fighting, such as the simple jump­
ing mechanic in Super Mario Brothers. How does the game provide variations on 
this simple jump combat mechanic?
Pick a video game that offers a wide variety of fighting options. Does having so 
many fighting options make the game easier or harder to learn? Identify how many 
variations each fighting option offers. Does this make the game more challenging to 
play or not?
Real-Time vs. Turn-Based Combat
In video games, there’s a choice between real-time or turn-based combat. Real-time 
combat emphasizes player dexterity in responding to enemy actions. As a result, 
real-time combat video games let players feel their skill can determine the success 
(or failure) of any attack.
Turn-based combat emphasizes player strategy because they can take time to 
analyze each situation and choose their best options to attack and defend. Turn-­
based combat gives fighting more of a strategic emphasis at the sacrifice of less 
realism. Choosing from a menu of different options can slow combat down in a 
turn-based combat game. In addition, gameplay can slow down since everyone must 
choose an action before the video game determines the result.
Since turn-based combat doesn’t rely on the familiarity of input controls or game 
enemies, turn-based combat can be easier and less intimidating for beginners to 
learn. Also since turn-based combat gives players time to analyze every combat 
situation, turn-based combat places less stress on players.
However, real-time combat can be more visually appealing and exciting. Whether 
your game uses real-time combat or turn-based combat, the combat system must be 
engaging to make players eager to play it multiple times. The more engaging the 
combat system of a game, the more people will continue replaying a game.
12  Fun in Combat

119
Thought Exercise
Pick a video game that uses real-time combat and imagine how the game would 
change if its combat system was turn-based. Pick a video game that uses turn-based 
combat and imagine how the game would change if its combat system was real-time.
The Consequences of Combat
In some games, waves of enemies exist solely for the player to mow them all down 
in as creative and emotionally satisfying ways possible. However, many games cre­
ate consequences for combat to make a game more interesting so each attack affects 
the future in some way.
Depending on how players treat non-player characters (NPCs), those NPCs may 
later be friendly or hostile in the future. That means if players rely on sheer violence 
to solve their problems, killing so many NPCs will likely make other NPCs leery 
and suspicious of the player so they’ll least likely to help them and may even attack 
them instead.
Consequences help link individual battles together so they don’t feel like endless 
waves of combat for no reason. Instead, combat with consequences helps tell a 
story. What players do now has repercussions in the near and far future.
This gives players another way to think about their options. Should they fight? 
Negotiate? Retreat? Sometimes combat means fighting and sometimes it means not 
fighting, which can give players more options than blindly charging into a bunch of 
enemies just to blast them away.
Thought Exercise
Pick a video game that lets players fight enemies using weapons or hand to hand 
combat. Is there a story that links the consequences of one battle to the next? If so, 
how does this affect the gameplay? If not, would the game be better or worse if the 
consequences of one battle affected the next in some way?
Summary
Combat has competing goals. On the one hand, if combat is too easy to learn, it risks 
being quick to get boring as well. On the other hand, if combat offers too many 
choices, it’s too hard to learn and use.
Summary

120
The ideal balance lies in creating combat options that are easy to learn but hard 
to master. That means combat options should offer few fighting options but provide 
variations for each option that provides a seemingly endless amount of options for 
players to learn, explore, and master.
Ultimately, combat is meant to challenge players by testing their skills and 
knowledge. The more challenging the combat against different enemies and envi­
ronments, the more players can feel powerful. Combat is nothing more than a way 
for players to exhibit mastery of their skills so they have the freedom to express 
themselves by their choices.

Fun in Strategy
Every game challenges players to achieve an objective using a combination of dif­
ferent skills (along with a little bit of luck). Video games often emphasize dexterity 
and quick reflexes but board games and some video games emphasize long-term 
planning instead. Such games fall under the category of strategy games.
Strategy is about choosing how to achieve a goal while tactics are the collective 
actions needed to support that strategy. As a result, strategy games are a type of 
puzzle game that offers a wide variety of possible solutions where all solutions are 
equally valid. The challenge lies in choosing the best solution (strategy) based on 
the current game conditions and the actions (and reactions) of the other players. 
Since game conditions and player actions will always change, strategy games pro­
vide an endless variety of situations for players to analyze and react to.
13.1
In this minimax figure, the player has two choices. One choice offers a + 6 ben­
efit while the other offers a + 2 benefit. Initially, the seemingly obvious choice 
would be the +6 option.
However, if the player chooses the +6 option, the opponent will choose an option 
to change the game state that minimizes the game state against the player. In this 
case, choosing the +6 option might look like the best choice, but then the opponent 
will likely choose the option that sets the game state against the player at −1.
On the other hand, if the player initially chooses the +2 option, the worst the 
opponent can choose in reaction is a + 1 option. Thus it appears that the +2 option 
could actually be the better move.

Understanding the Game Rules
Strategy games involve analyzing current game states to determine the best possible 
move. To do this, players need a comprehensive understanding of the game rules (so 
they know what their options are and the consequences of each possible move).
In chess, it’s not enough to know how the individual pieces move. Players must 
also understand how the position of the various game pieces (both the player’s and 
the opponent’s) can interact on the board to create different types of challenges.
Board and card games must make its rules available for all players to read and 
understand. However, video games often hide the rule details from players such as 
how the game calculates combat odds between units on different terrain. As a result, 
players must often play a game multiple times until they can fully understand how 
each game rule works.
Part of the fun in playing strategy games is learning what all the rules are and 
then knowing how to apply those rules to gain an advantage. By knowing all the 
rules, you know all your options. By knowing how to apply those rules, you know 
the best time to rely on certain rules.
In chess, beginners often overlook moves like castling and en passant that depend 
on specific circumstances. However, chess masters not only know all possible 
moves, but also the best times to castle as well.
In a video game, armies might fight well against one type of opponent but poorly 
against another. Terrain might also make a difference such as defending from a 
higher position or trying to force march through swamp land. Video games can also 
13  Fun in Strategy

123
hide details of the battlefield so players won’t know what the terrain is or what 
enemy units might be located there until they search that particular area.
The more players can understand the rules and how different game elements 
might affect these rules, the better players can choose their best option at any given 
time. For strategy game enthusiasts, part of the fun lies in deciphering the game’s 
rules so they can fully master the game.
Thought Exercise
Pick a strategy board game and identify all the common rules and all the less com­
mon rules. Think of a game situation when a less common rule might give you an 
advantage.
Pick a video game and identify how you can infer the rules. What are some ways 
you can test your understanding of a rule in a video game?
Evaluating All Possible Choices
The more choices available, the more interesting the strategy game. Not only must 
players identify all possible choices, but they must also evaluate the best ones. In a 
good strategy game, some choices will be better than others, but in different circum­
stances, other choices might be better.
In making the first move in chess, players can move any of the pawns or the 
knights. Players cannot move the king, queen, bishops, or rooks because they’re 
blocked in by the pawns. However, later in the game, moving a bishop or rook might 
be a far better choice than moving a pawn or a knight. Yet in other situations, mov­
ing a pawn might be better than moving a queen. By giving players so many choices 
where the “best” choice constantly changes based on circumstances, chess always 
challenges players so they’ll keep playing the game.
The more valid options available to the player at any given time, the more inter­
esting the game. Valid options are any choices that could bring the player closer to 
victory while invalid options are choices that do not bring the player closer to vic­
tory. In chess, an invalid option might be moving a queen so it can be captured the 
next turn by the enemy with no resulting benefit. Therefore it should be easy for 
players to ignore invalid options but hard for them to choose between seemingly 
equal valid options.
With so many available valid options, evaluating the best valid option involves 
tradeoffs. Tradeoffs mean that no option will universally be best. Instead, each 
option can be best depending on how an opponent reacts and which strategy they 
choose. Some of the different possible tradeoffs include:
Evaluating All Possible Choices

124
•	 Offense vs. Defense
•	 Short-term gain vs. Long-term potential
•	 Low risk/Low reward vs. High risk/High reward
•	 Time vs. Resources
•	 Light vs. Heavy
The classic strategy choice forces players to emphasize whether they should focus 
on attacking opponents or build up their own resources and protect them against 
opponents. Thus the dilemma involves choosing a balanced mix of offensive and 
defensive capabilities.
Short-term gain promises immediate advantages while long-term potential 
promises advantages later in the game. This sets up a dilemma. Do you sacrifice 
short-term gain for long-term potential (and risk never reaching the long-term 
potential)? Or do you pursue short-term gain (and sacrifice any long-term poten­
tial gain)?
Sometimes the safe choice is to choose a low risk, low reward option. This often 
translates into a “sure” bet such as a financial game that forces players to choose 
between investing in bonds that pay a low interest rate but almost never go bankrupt. 
In comparison to bonds, players may have the option of investing in riskier stocks 
that could go bankrupt or skyrocket overnight.
The right answer is often a mix of both safe and riskier options, but which safe 
and risky options you choose and how many safe options you choose compared to 
risky ones keeps the game challenging.
Another tradeoff involves sacrificing time for resources, or expending resources 
to buy time. A game where you control a kingdom might force you to choose 
between spending time to farm or saving time by invading a neighboring country to 
steal their food supplies.
With a Light vs. Heavy tradeoff, players must choose between two extremes such 
as quality vs. quantity. Do you choose to build lots of weak units or a much smaller 
number of more powerful units? What about faster units that require more fuel or 
slower units that require less fuel?
A similar variation involves specialization vs. generalization. Should you build 
units that do one task well (and other tasks poorly), or should you build units that 
can do everything but none of it well?
The key to options is that there’s never a clear “right” answer. Thus players must 
choose the strategy they want to pursue and then pick the options that give that 
strategy the best chance to succeed by sacrificing some types of benefits in exchange 
for other benefits instead.
Thought Exercise
Pick a strategy game and identify the available opening moves each player can 
make. What are the tradeoffs for each option? Under what circumstances would a 
player find one option more desirable than another?
13  Fun in Strategy

125
If a player chooses one extreme option or another (such as focusing 100% on 
offense or 100% on defense), is there still a chance the player can win? Why or 
why not?
Evaluating Possible Consequences
Another key in strategy games is not only giving players multiple options at all 
times, but forcing them to evaluate the consequences of each option. Starting a war 
against a neighboring country might seem appealing, especially if the country is 
weak and easily conquered. However, this could turn other countries against the 
player, making future trade and negotiations difficult.
Consequences can be negative but they can also be positive as well. If players 
have a choice of attacking a country that’s already invading a weaker country, the 
player’s attack could increase the chance other countries will want to trade and sup­
port the player. In chess, it’s possible to sacrifice a queen to gain a positional advan­
tage several moves later.
Part of the challenge lies in evaluating possible consequences for each decision, 
and hoping you evaluated each consequence accurately. It’s entirely possible to 
choose an option that seems to have minimal consequences, only to find out later 
that your decision actually creates massive problems that you overlooked.
To evaluate consequences, players need to decide how their choices might affect 
the game and how their opponent might react to each decision. Sometimes oppo­
nents might not respond rationally or may react in an unexpected manner because 
they’re busy pursuing a different strategy that you may not recognize.
The inability to predict all possible consequences for each decision makes any 
strategy game interesting and unpredictable. Guess the consequences correctly and 
you can plan ahead. Guess the consequences poorly and even the best strategy can 
fall apart.
Ideally, every option should offer the player benefits and consequences. This 
forces the player to decide whether the benefits of a given option are worth the con­
sequences or not.
Thought Exercise
Pick a strategy game and evaluate two different options. What are the consequences 
of each option? If the consequences are not predictable, how could they drastically 
change for better or worse?
Thought Exercise

126
Anticipating the Opponent’s Strategy
Whether you play against a human opponent or a computer-controlled one, players 
must anticipate the opponent’s moves. The opponent’s moves can block the player’s 
strategy or bring the opponent closer to victory, forcing the player to devote more 
energy towards stopping the opponent than trying to win themselves.
To defeat an opponent, players must plan their own strategy and understand what 
their opponent may be trying to do. The better players can understand their oppo­
nent’s plans, the better players can defeat those plans or block them from interfering 
with the player’s own plans.
Strategy games essentially force players to create and implement their own plan 
while also watching how an opponent’s plan may be unfolding. When there are 
multiple players in a game, each player must interact with all the other players, 
which can lead to alliances (and broken agreements) and deception to fool others 
about each other’s plan.
Interacting with multiple players also creates another level of gameplay where 
each player attempts to influence the others. By tricking one player into taking a 
certain action that winds up helping you, players can negotiate and backstab one 
another to gain an advantage, which can increase enjoyment of the overall game.
Strategy games work best when players can out think and out bluff an opponent 
rather than rely on faster reflexes and physical dexterity to win the game.
Thought Exercise
Pick a strategy video game where one player competes against the computer. Now 
pick a multiplayer strategy board game where multiple human players compete 
against each other. How can players foil the strategies of the computer? How can 
players foil the strategies of multiple human opponents?
Characteristics of Strategy Games
Action-oriented games emphasize reflexes and dexterity. On the other hand, strat­
egy games emphasize analysis and planning. Some of the key characteristics of 
strategy games include:
•	 Multiple paths to victory
•	 Dramatically changing gameplay each turn/loop
•	 Feedback loops
In some board and video games, there’s only one way to achieve victory by reaching 
a specific goal. In strategy games, the fun lies in the fact that there is no single best 
13  Fun in Strategy

127
way to win a game each time you play it. Winning the game depends partly on luck, 
but mostly on players correctly analyzing the game state and reacting as it changes. 
That means a strategy that worked while playing one game won’t necessarily work 
while replaying that same game because the circumstances and opponent actions 
will likely change.
Besides offering multiple paths to victory, another way strategy games can alter 
victory conditions is by offering different ways a game could end. By offering mul­
tiple ways to win, strategy games offer players the freedom to choose the method 
they think is best.
Some common ways strategy games can end are:
•	 Acquisition – When one player collects a specific number or percentage of items 
or resources.
•	 Elimination – When all players are eliminated from the game. Also called “last 
man standing”.
•	 Physical Goal – When one or more players reach a specific physical objective 
(like checkmating the king in chess).
•	 Points – When one player reaches a specific number of points.
•	 Spatial Endings – When one player controls a specific portion of space such as 
50% of all territories or properties.
•	 Target – When one player captures, destroys, or collects an item or location.
•	 Turns – When a fixed number of turns has passed and one player has the lead in 
one of the above categories.
Because strategy games are much less action-oriented than first-person shooter or 
other action-oriented games, strategy games create variety by constantly changing 
the choices and challenges that confront each player in every turn. These new chal­
lenges are a direct result of the decisions each player made that interacts with other 
decisions, creating a constantly shifting landscape to analyze.
Part of the fun comes from studying each player’s move to determine how it 
affects you and how best you can take advantage of this new situation. To make this 
work, strategy games provide constant feedback so players understand the conse­
quences of each decision.
Feedback comes from studying the playing field and analyzing the resources 
each opponent may hold. Often times this information remains hidden but players 
can deduce their opponent’s status by their current and past actions. In poker, play­
ers can memorize their opponent’s past actions to deduce what they’re more likely 
to do in the present, which adds an additional layer of intrigue (and fun) in the game.
Each turn in a strategy game typically offers new and different challenges. In 
some strategy games, players take turns, which means each player must analyze and 
respond to the opponent who plays before them. Then the player’s actions directly 
affect the options available to the opponent who plays after them. Thus sequential 
play creates obstacles for players based on the actions of the opponent before them.
Instead of sequential play, strategy games may opt for simultaneous play, which 
means every player chooses an action without a chance to see what other players 
Characteristics of Strategy Games

128
might do first. Simultaneous play creates a different layer of interaction by forcing 
players to make decisions in the absence of other player’s choices.
Based on their available resources, players must choose the best options based on 
the current game state that’s constantly changing from the choices of each player. 
This constantly changing interaction makes every turn in a strategy game act like a 
different puzzle to solve. Each player has full knowledge of their resources but only 
partial knowledge of their opponent’s resources and goals.
Strategy games often offer three different play structures:
•	 Inclusive Play – All players remain in the game until the end.
•	 Exclusive Play – Players gradually drop out until only a single winner (or win­
ners) are left.
•	 Cooperative Play – Players can cooperate with each other to work towards a 
single goal, work as a team against other teams, or work against time limit.
Inclusive play can work best with multiple human players, often in a board game so 
play becomes more of a social event. By keeping everyone involved in the game, 
everyone can keep playing. Card games such as poker or bridge let people play 
together, mostly for social reasons.
Exclusive play offers a more competitive game and can work when games are 
short so players who get eliminated early don’t need to wait long before another 
game starts up again. Monopoly is a board game that’s often criticized since the 
game often goes on for too long as players gradually drop out.
Cooperative play can involve players working together to solve a single problem, 
such as trying to control a disease in the game Pandemic. In this case, all players 
win or lose as a group. Other types of cooperative play puts players in teams where 
they compete against other teams. In this way, players on the same team can form 
friendships but the game may then scramble players on different teams later.
Video games can be particularly appealing to individuals who can’t always get 
people to play in person, so they can play with online friends and strangers instead 
who may be located anywhere around the world.
Thought Exercise
The way a strategy game ends and the way it plays can greatly determine how play­
ers experience the game. Pick a strategy game and change the way it ends. Then 
change the player experience such as from inclusive play to exclusive play. How 
does each change alter the way the game works?
One hazard strategy games must avoid is an emergent, dominant strategy that 
wins all the time. Such a dominant strategy makes all other choices irrelevant to the 
point where players will no longer even consider them, which narrows the variety 
and scope of the game. Can you identify any emergent, dominant strategy in a strat­
egy game? If so, how can this dominant strategy be fixed to keep the other game 
options attractive?

Summary
Strategy games are about making decisions that involve weighing the pros and cons 
of every choice. When played alone, strategy games are like fancy versions of 
Solitaire but where players have more control over their chances. When including 
multiple players, strategy games force everyone to consider not only their own deci­
sions, but how to react to the decisions of the other players.
Multiple players can work together, work in teams, or work individually. Part of 
the fun in strategy games lies in analyzing the current state of a game and then 
choosing options from a constantly changing environment. Through thoughtful 
planning, bluffing, and deception, players can ultimately achieve success in a strat­
egy game.

Fun in Economics
Economies within a game represent the movement of resources. Because resources 
can be valuable (within the game), game economies can influence player behavior. 
Players will find a way to get rich within a game economy so they can increase their 
chance of success within the game.
Many games have some form of economics where players gather resources, trade 
them, and convert them into other valuable items like weapons and armor. In many 
games, an economics system helps make the game more realistic but isn’t the main 
focus of the game. However in some organization simulation games, the whole 
point of the game is to give players a chance to manage resources on a large scale 
such as running a city, a company, or an entire civilization.
Whether economics are the main focus of the game or just a small part of the 
game, economics forces players to make choices in managing resources. Any time 
players choose to buy one item, that means they can’t buy a different item. Such 
choices force players to think strategically so they can maximize their chances of 
reaching their goals.
Economies in games often consist of the following parts:
•	 Taps
•	 Inventories
•	 Converters
•	 Drains
•	 Traders
Taps create resources. This can be something as simple as killing enemies and 
receiving money as a reward or something more complicated such as mining for 
gold. Taps are necessary to provide resources for the player to earn or collect.
Taps can appear within a game in several ways:
•	 Defeating enemies/challenges
•	 Random

•	 Time
•	 Real money
Games often reward players for their actions, whether they win or lose. The more 
they play, the more rewards they get. This encourages players to take risks within 
the game and keep playing the game as many times as possible.
Sometimes players can find resources by exploring a new area of the game world. 
This encourages players to risk visiting new places. In some games, taps can appear 
at random, such as loot boxes that players can find.
Another source of resources can be time. The longer the player stays alive, the 
more points the player may earn. Thus the game rewards survival such as making it 
through an entire level without getting defeated by an enemy or obstacle.
Finally, many games even allow players to buy resources, trading real money for 
in-game items. Thus a player’s own bank account in the real world can act as a tap 
within a video game. The more taps a game offers, the greater the variety of play 
within the game.
Inventories hold resources such as a backpack or a bank. In some games when a 
player dies, all items in the inventory are lost. In other games when a player dies, the 
items in the inventory remain scattered in the area where the player died, which 
gives the player a chance to revisit that area to retrieve any items. Inventories are 
necessary to hold any resources the player collects.
Converters let players exchange one type of resource for another, such as turning 
gold ore into money or exchanging experience points for greater abilities such as 
increased intelligence or dexterity. Converters are necessary so any resource can 
eventually be converted into in-game money for players to spend.
Drains are the opposite of taps. Where taps create new resources, drains destroy 
existing resources to prevent an overabundance of resources. The simplest drain is 
ammunition for a gun. Each time the player fires it, there’s one less bullet available 
to use in the future. Drains can also force players to act if players gradually lose 
health over time and must replenish their health by eating food, which can 
cost money.
In a board game like Monopoly, drains are unexpected bills players must pay 
when they land on a certain space or draw an unlucky card. Drains exist to ensure 
there’s never an unlimited number of resources within a game.
Traders are a variation of converters. Where converters let players exchange 
resources for other items at a fixed rate for clothing, weapons, or supplies, traders 
introduce varying prices and costs. This provides players with another source of 
income. Rather than mine, farm, or retrieve resources, players can simply trade 
resources.
One area of a gaming world might have an abundance of wheat or iron that play­
ers can transport to another area to sell those resources at a large profit. Traders act 
like a combination of taps and converters. Traders are necessary to create additional 
risks and rewards for trading resources.
Economies can be zero-sum or positive sum. A zero-sum economy means there’s 
a fixed number of resources available, which encourages players to fight each other 
14  Fun in Economics

133
for those scarce resources. A positive-sum economy means there’s a constant gen­
eration of new resources so players have far less incentive to fight each other and 
more incentive to collect as many new resources as they arrive.
At the most basic level, economies need taps and drains where taps provide 
resources and drains eliminate those resources to keep them from becoming too 
numerous. By balancing taps and drains, designers can shape a game’s economy.
Thought Exercise
Pick a board game and identify how resources are created and how they can be 
destroyed. Then identify if the game uses inventories, converters, and traders. How 
do these affect gameplay?
Pick a video game and repeat the above. The main difference between a board 
game and a video game is that a board game forces players to manage the game 
economics while in a video game, the computer takes care of managing the game 
economics.
What is the advantage of having players manage the game economy? What is the 
disadvantage?
What is the advantage of having the computer manage the game economy? What 
is the disadvantage?
Shaping Player Behavior
Money changes people’s behavior and in-game currencies are no different. Because 
of this, one way games can influence players’ behavior is through the use of its 
game economy.
If a game wants to encourage players to explore and fight enemies, the game can 
reward players by emphasizing taps. Scatter treasure chests and valuable items 
around the game world to encourage players to explore. Provide a variety of rewards 
each time players defeat enemies. By rewarding the behavior you want players to 
do, they’ll likely do more of it.
If a game wants to encourage players to interact with others, including non-­
player characters (NPCs), then the game can emphasize converters and traders. 
Rather than give players valuable items directly, the game can force them to acquire 
resources, such as gold ore, that must be converted into something useful like food, 
clothes, or tools. Now players must collect resources and then travel to people who 
can convert their resources to what the players need.
To encourage players to trade, a game can emphasize various converters that 
have changing prices. As soon as players discover they can buy items at a low price 
and sell them at a higher price somewhere else, they’ll be more likely to engage in 
trading and speculating.
Shaping Player Behavior

134
Similar to trading is gambling. By offering gambling within a game, players can 
win (or lose) money. Gambling in-game currency gives players a chance to earn 
extra money quickly but at the risk of losing their money just as fast.
Games can also offer an investment system that forces players to expend 
resources now in hopes for a larger payoff later in the future. The challenge is that 
players must decide which long-term strategy to pursue. All may offer advantages 
but the advantages depend on the player’s own strategy within the game.
Many management simulation games emphasize long-term planning. Should 
players plant crops to feed their people, but at the risk of inviting other players to 
attack them and steal their food? Or should players emphasize military power at the 
risk of not having enough resources left over to feed their population?
By offering a collection of resources, games can entice players to complete an 
entire collection, such as collecting all the monsters in Pokemon or all the cards in 
Magic: The Gathering. Collections of resources give players an incentive to com­
plete their collection and provides another goal players can pursue within a game.
To increase a player’s sense of despair and helplessness, especially in horror 
games, emphasize drains such as the player’s health or supplies like limited ammu­
nition. If players expend or lose resources faster than they get them, each resource 
will feel far more precious. This forces players to hoard their resources.
Emphasizing a player’s inventory and how to spend resources essentially defines 
the basis for many strategy games or management simulation games. Now players 
must spend time analyzing the current situation and deciding how to allocate their 
resources to best pursue specific strategies.
Perhaps the greatest influence on player behavior occurs through the snowball 
effect, which can also be described as “the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.” 
That means players in the lead often have more opportunities to get even further 
ahead. Conversely, players falling behind have fewer opportunities, which causes 
them to fall even further behind.
The classic example of this occurs in Monopoly. Richer players have more 
money to buy properties, houses, and hotels while being able to withstand unex­
pected expenses. Poor players have less money to buy properties, houses, and hotels, 
which means they can generate far less income. Because they have less money, 
unexpected bills can force poor players to sell houses, hotels, or even entire proper­
ties so they can pay their debt. This creates a downward spiral for poorer players 
with fewer resources to generate any future income.
One way to help players who are behind is to give them additional bonuses or 
advantages so they can catch up to the leader. A second away to help players who 
are behind is to give players in the lead fewer bonuses or advantages. In both cases, 
helping players who are behind or minimizing advantages to the leader will keep the 
leader from pulling so far ahead so that other players have no chance of winning and 
simply drop out of the game.
Letting the rich get richer and the poor get poorer creates an overall negative 
game experience for everyone but the winner. Ideally, games need to minimize a 
leader’s advantage and aid players falling behind to keep the game outcome in doubt.
14  Fun in Economics

135
By simply emphasizing one part of an economy (taps, drains, converters, traders, 
inventories), games can greatly influence how players behave. By using resources as 
rewards, depending on whether players are ahead or not, games can keep a game 
challenging for all players from start to finish.
Thought Exercise
Pick a game with a game economy and identify which part the game emphasizes the 
most (taps, drains, converters, traders, or inventories). How does this emphasis 
change the gameplay? What would happen if this economic emphasis were reduced 
or eliminated altogether?
Types of Resources
Resources come in different forms. The most basic resource is money that players 
can spend to buy items. Through taps, money can be earned by doing jobs or finding 
them as treasures. Through drains, money can be spent to buy new items or repair 
current items.
Money may not be the only resource in a game. One other type of resource is 
subsistence, which can be represented as food or health points. While playing the 
game, players will consume (drain) subsistence, which forces the player to find or 
buy additional food or health points (taps). Where money represent resources that 
players can collect and hoard, subsistence resources represent consumables that 
players need on a regular basis just to keep playing the game.
Another type of resource are shortcuts, which typically provide a useful advan­
tage to the player such as enhanced movement, combat, or healing abilities. Think 
of games where players can find a magic sword, a powerful gun, or a medical kit. 
Shortcut resources may be temporary (such as increasing a player’s size for a lim­
ited amount of time) or permanent as long as the player possesses that item (such as 
enhanced armor that provides increased protection from attacks).
Players can often find shortcut resources by defeating enemies or finding them 
by chance (such as in loot boxes). Shortcut resources can increase a player’s chance 
of success but may also be traded or sold so they also represent a type of money 
resource as well.
Sometimes resources simply enhances a player’s overall character such as giving 
increased strength, dexterity, health, intelligence, or experience points. Increased 
strength may give the player the ability to use more powerful weapons while 
increased health may give the player the ability to withstand battle damage longer. 
Increased experience points may help boost a player’s ability to access more power­
ful equipment.
Types of Resources

136
Such enhancements or power-ups can vary in duration. Sometimes they last as 
long as the player owns the item (such a magical shield), sometimes they last for a 
limited time (such as the power-ups in Pac-Man that temporarily allow players to 
eat their enemies instead of the other way around), and sometimes they last until a 
certain event happens (such as getting hit a fixed number of times). By varying the 
duration of a power-up, games can prevent power-ups from dominating the game 
and making other resources less useful.
Some resources may serve little purpose other than to enhance a player’s social 
status among other players. Such status enhancement resources might include 
“skins” for vehicles or customized graphics for clothing. Status resources exist so 
players can show off their achievements or just provide another way to enjoy the 
game through customization of a player’s character or possessions.
By including and emphasizing different types of resources, a game can influence 
players’ actions. A survival game might emphasize the constant need to find food 
while a casual game might emphasize winning shortcut resources to overcome dif­
ficult challenges. By offering different types of resources, games can create differ­
ent experiences for players to enjoy.
Thought Exercise
Common resources in a game include:
•	 Money
•	 Shortcuts
•	 Power-ups
Pick a game and identify the types of resources available. Which type of resource 
does the game emphasize and how does this affect the actions of the players?
For example, Monopoly focuses solely on money so players strive to earn as 
much money as possible. On the other hand, a game like Dungeons and Dragons 
includes money (gold coins), shortcuts (magic swords), and power-ups (potions to 
increase strength). How do these different types of resources affect player actions? 
How long do power-ups last and how does this affect the value of the power-up?
The Psychology of Money
People don’t like losing and they especially don’t like losing money. To divorce 
people’s emotional attachment to money, games use play money. Players exchange 
real money for play money and since play money isn’t real money, they feel less 
emotionally attached to the value of play money.
This is why poker and other gambling games substitute real money with plastic 
chips that seem to have less value than the equivalent real money. Video games

adopt this same principle by using in-game currency as a substitute for real money. 
To further divorce emotions from real money, many video games offer several types 
of in-game currency.
One type might represent real money. Another type of currency might just be 
rewards for completing tasks or finding treasure within the game. By getting players 
comfortable spending in-game currency that cannot be exchanged for real money, 
games help desensitize players to the idea of spending in-game currencies of 
all types.
In gambling games, players can always exchange plastic chips for real money at 
any time. However in many video games, the exchange can only go from trading 
real money for in-game currency, but never the other way around. Yet other video 
games, such as Entropia Universe, do allow players to exchange in-game currency 
for real money, which creates a real world opportunity for players to profit from 
their activities within the game.
Video games use in-game currency so players can buy items or powers as a short­
cut. For players unwilling to pay for items or powers, they can still receive them but 
only after playing the game for a long period of time. Thus games give players the 
choice of spending either time or money to get further ahead.
Such an arrangement must be fair because if players can only buy special items 
or powers, they can essentially pay to win. Pay to win games put non-paying players 
at a disadvantage, causing them to drop out. Thus the game can eventually rely less 
on skill and experience and more on who’s willing to pay the most to win the game.
In many video games, players know exactly what rewards they’ll gain by per­
forming certain actions. In other video games, rewards occur randomly. One varia­
tion of random rewards are loot boxes.
Loot boxes are essentially rewards that players receive periodically after playing 
a certain amount of time or by finding items scattered throughout the gaming world. 
Because loot boxes contain random items, many video games let players pay real 
money to purchase additional loot boxes. The catch is that the contents of each loot 
box can vary from trivial items to super rare and powerful items that can give play­
ers a huge advantage.
Because the value of loot boxes is unpredictable, paying for additional loot boxes 
is basically a form of gambling. When players find loot boxes for free through 
exploring the gaming world or as rewards for completing quests, the unpredictable 
nature of loot boxes doesn’t matter. When video games encourage players, espe­
cially children, to spend real money to buy loot boxes, this can be an ethical and 
moral problem.
Essentially games replace real money with play money or use play money that 
players can earn within the game. This play money helps players think of it less as 
real money so they’ll be willing to spend it more freely.
The Psychology of Money

138
Thought Exercise
Pick a video game and identify all the in-game currencies the game offers. What are 
all the ways that players get more in-game currency? Does the video game let play­
ers exchange in-game currency for real money or does it only allow players to spend 
real money to get in-game currency? Can players simply spend enough money to win?
Pick a card game that allows players to buy additional cards using real money. 
How does this game prevent players from winning by simply spending more?
Summary
Economies are often just one part of a game but in management simulations, econo­
mies may represent the entire game. The most basic part of any economy involves 
taps and drains. Taps are anything that create resources while drains are anything 
that consumes and eliminates resources. Inventories hold resources, converters let 
players exchange resources for other items, and traders let players profit through 
moving resources from one area to another.
The way an economy works can influence player behavior. If resources are scarce 
(more drains than taps), players will likely play more cautiously. If resources are 
plentiful (more taps than drains), players will likely take more risks.
Resources can be money, shortcuts, or power-ups. Sometimes resources may 
need to be converted into another resource such as converting iron into armor and 
swords. Economies exist to influence player behavior in a game.

Fun in Storytelling
“Great stories agree with our world view. The best stories don’t 
teach people anything new. Instead, the best stories agree with 
what the audience already believes and makes the members of 
the audience feel smart and secure when reminded how right 
they were in the first place.” 
– Seth Godin, “Tribes: We Need You to Lead Us.”
Every game tells a story. That story may be brief (run away from ghosts as Pac-­
Man) or extremely detailed (the sole survivor on a plane that crashes in the Atlantic 
Ocean discovers an underwater city in BioShock).
Games don’t need stories, but stories can enhance a game through setting, graph­
ics, and tone to create a specific experience for players to enjoy. Strip away the story 
and every first-person shooter looks no more exciting than running around a maze, 
shooting at different shaped enemies that pop up at random intervals.
Now add a story and those same shapes in a maze could be hordes of zombies 
trying to trap you in a shopping mall, a posse of cowboys hunting you down in the 
Old West, or swarms of orcs attacking you in a castle located in a fantasy world. 
Each of these conflicts might be identical but story makes each one unique and adds 
a different type of meaning to the gameplay.
At the simplest level, story can provide a background history that explains the 
purpose of the game. In a game about building a space station on Mars, the story can 
explain that the player represents the first colonists on Mars who must survive by 
terraforming the planet and overcome natural disasters. Once the story explains the 
game setting, the player is free to make choices that can send the game in a variety 
of directions.
On a more complicated level, story defines the direction and experience of the 
player from start to finish. In many horror survival games, the story defines a spe­
cific order of events that players must follow in gathering information, meeting 
people, and solving puzzles. In these types of games, story shepherds the player 
from one scene to another with little freedom to deviate from the story’s plot. 
Although players have much less freedom, story-driven games give players a

specific type of experience that’s not possible to get from games that give players 
more choices and freedom.
Ultimately, story defines the player’s emotional experience in the game.
Thought Exercise
Pick a board game that does not have a story (such as backgammon, checkers, or 
chess). Does the lack of story help or hurt the game? How would adding a story to 
a board game make it better (or worse)?
Pick an old arcade game and identify its story. Imagine if this arcade game did 
not have a story. How would that affect the player’s experience playing the game?
Pick a more current video game and identify its story. How does this story shape 
the experience in playing the game?
The Elements of a Game Story
In the world of fiction (books, TV shows, and movies), a story highlights a hero 
striving to reach a goal while overcoming obstacles. At all times, fiction strives to 
tell a story by showing a hero in action.
In the world of games (board games and video games), a story also highlights a 
hero striving to reach a goal while overcoming obstacles. The main difference is that 
instead of seeing a hero in action, games let players control the hero’s actions. While 
fiction lets people experience a story by reading or seeing it, games let people expe­
rience a story by acting in it.
As a result, storytelling through a game revolves around the core game mechanic 
that players do most often. In both Tomb Raider and Uncharted, the story revolves 
around visiting exotic locations, battling enemies, and searching for treasure. So the 
main, repetitive action players perform in these games involve exploring, fighting, 
and solving puzzles to find the treasure.
To help players bond more easily with characters in a video game, many games 
rely on the crutch that the hero has amnesia. This lets the player and the character 
learn the elements of the gaming world together so there’s no possibility that the 
hero will possess any character traits that the player does not also possess.
Rather than rely on amnesia, a far better solution is to simply present an admi­
rable hero that players of all types and backgrounds will admire and enjoy playing. 
That’s why video game heroes are often described in broad strokes. Lara Croft from 
Tomb Raider is a British archeologist. Nathan Drake from Uncharted is a charis­
matic yet rebellious treasure hunter. Zelda from The Princess of Zelda is a princess 
ruling over a kingdom. Lacking in all video game heroes are detailed descriptions 
of their emotional personalities, which could contradict the player’s own 
personality.
15  Fun in Storytelling

141
Video games often describe heroes with appealing characteristics, which allows 
players of all types to embrace the hero. After all, even men can relate to the courage 
of Lara Croft as she explores ancient catacombs and even women can relate to 
Nathan Drake as he single-handedly defeats a multitude of enemies attacking him. 
Romance games may target young women, but both men and women can enjoy 
striving for love.
In video games, the player is the hero. Then the game’s setting lets the player 
express themselves through the hero’s actions and interactions with other characters 
and their decisions within the game world.
In general, the more detailed the hero, the more tightly bound players will be 
forced towards achieving a specific goal. The less detailed the hero, the more free­
dom players will have to do anything they want.
In Minecraft, the hero has little personality beyond their physical appearance. 
Thus players are free to do anything they want from killing enemies to building 
structures. Any stories the player experiences are created solely through the player’s 
own actions. The game simply provides a setting for those stories to take place.
In video games like Uncharted or Tomb Raider, the hero has a more distinct per­
sonality. Thus players are more tightly bound by the story. After all, it wouldn’t 
make sense to describe Lara Croft as an archeologist if the game let players control 
her in a kitchen to bake cookies and run a restaurant. Neither does it make sense to 
describe Nathan Drake as a treasure hunter if the game isn’t going to give players 
various treasures to find throughout the game.
Thus the three most crucial elements in a game story are:
•	 The hero
•	 The setting
•	 The core game mechanics
The setting provides the world for the player to explore. The hero provides a specific 
type of personality that will engage players. The setting must provide the greatest 
possible challenge for that particular hero to perform the game’s main core mechan­
ics such as moving, fighting, solving puzzles, talking to people, or managing 
resources.
Games typically define the hero by their occupation and this indirectly defines 
the setting for the game world as well as the hero’s goal. In Diner Dash, the hero is 
a restaurant owner named Flo. This occupation immediately defines the game 
world’s setting as a restaurant where Flo must serve customers. The core game 
mechanic involves moving back and forth to take orders and serve customers in a 
timely manner.
Once you know who the game’s hero is, you automatically know the setting and 
the player’s goal. Then you can craft the core game mechanic to emphasize that set­
ting. Or you can create an interesting core game mechanic first and then shape a 
setting and hero to match that core mechanic.
The more distinct the hero, the more defined the goal within the setting. 
Conversely, once you decide on a setting, you automatically know the type of hero 
who will fit in that setting.
The Elements of a Game Story

142
Create a game world set on a remote island and your hero must be someone most 
challenged to be on that remote island, such as a plane crash or shipwrecked survi­
vor. Putting a restaurant owner (from Diner Dash) on a remote island to survive 
among wild animals wouldn’t make sense.
Thought Exercise
Pick a video game where players control a hero. What type of occupation does the 
hero have? How does this occupation help define the game’s setting? How does the 
hero’s occupation help define the game’s goal?
How would the game experience change if the hero’s occupation had nothing to 
do with the game’s setting or goal?
Creating a Game World
The graphics of a video game can put players in any type of world from ancient 
Roman history to fantasy worlds with flying dragons and elves to science fiction 
spaceships visiting far away planets. However, creating a game world involves more 
than just fancy graphics. To make a game world feel real, games must also emphasize:
•	 Places
•	 Items
•	 Relationships
Every game world needs distinct and memorable places. When a game is based on 
real locations, the easiest places to highlight are actual landmarks such as the Golden 
Gate bridge that defines San Francisco, the Eiffel Tower in Paris, or Times Square 
in New  York City. When players see notable landmarks in a video game, that 
enhances the illusion that they’re actually in a real world.
If games don’t use actual landmarks, they often use stereotypes to represent cer­
tain areas in the real world such as palm trees and beaches to represent Southern 
California, signs written in Russian to represent a Moscow subway station, or 
decrepit houses displaying architecture from Civil War era plantations in the deep 
South. By emulating known buildings, structures, or landscapes, games can suggest 
that players are part of those particular parts of the world.
When games need to depict worlds that don’t exist such as fantasy worlds or sci­
ence fiction settings, they still play on our memories of existing locations and our 
expectations for what that type of setting should contain.
A world of medieval fantasy will likely contain castles, primitive wooden homes, 
and stables for boarding horses or equivalent animals like dragons. To further 
ground players in the realism of the game world, the game will likely put players in 
familiar settings such as taverns and trading posts.
15  Fun in Storytelling

143
On the other hand, a world of science fiction may depict a future, but it must still 
be a future that players can recognize. That means futuristic settings display famil­
iar settings such as restaurants, military command posts, and fighting vehicles such 
as armored mobile weapons that resemble futuristic tanks or starships that resemble 
technologically advanced battleships or jet fighters.
The more familiar the places in a game world, the easier players can understand 
and adapt to that imaginary world. The key is that every game world relies on our 
knowledge of common locations and expected types of locations such as a repair 
depot for a science fiction setting or a blacksmith shop for a fantasy or western 
setting.
At the simplest level, places can appear in the background, but a better solution 
forces players to interact with those recognizable locations as well. Put the Eiffel 
Tower in the background and players know they’re in Paris. Now make players 
engage in a firefight around the base of the Eiffel Tower and then climb it to elimi­
nate enemies, and then the realistic setting further immerses players in the 
game world.
Similar to familiar or expected locations are similar and expected items. A west­
ern setting feels more real when players can see cowboys sporting six-shooters in 
leather holsters on their hip while a fantasy setting feels more real when players can 
see wizards carrying magic staffs and warriors wearing armor and wielding 
broadswords.
Therefore games often emphasize players finding, collecting, and manipulating 
items that further emphasize the tone of the game world. In Fallout 3, players roam 
around a post-apocalyptic world where everyone uses bottle caps as currency. Bottle 
caps are usually a trivial item but in a futuristic world devastated by nuclear war, 
bottle caps represent a rarity, making them perfect as a symbol for money in that 
particular game world.
The more an item emphasizes the game world, the more importance players will 
give that item. That helps create a more engaging world.
Finally, note the relationships between different characters including the player. 
Non-player characters populating a game world have their own motives, history, 
and relationships with others. By learning how different characters relate to others 
and their beliefs about the game world, players can feel that the game world has 
more substance. If one group of elves hates another group of elves in a fantasy 
game, that tells players something about the dynamics of the world. Now players 
can use this information to make alliances to help them achieve their own goals.
Relationships characters have with others often focus on strong emotions like 
love, hate, revenge, or fear. The more other characters exhibit common emotions 
towards others, the more real the game world will feel.
Game worlds must always be grounded in reality, but that reality can be based on 
our imagination as well as reality. Through places, items, and relationships between 
characters, players can learn more about the game world they inhabit, making that 
game world feel more like real life.
Creating a Game World

144
Thought Exercise
Pick a video game with a unique setting and identify what common landmarks help 
make the game world feel like an actual location. Identify what items players use 
most often. Identify any relationships characters have with others that further 
defines the dynamics of the game world.
Using Story to Define the Path to the Goal
If a story defines the game setting and goal, that same story also defines everything 
that blocks the player from achieving that goal. Three common ways to stop players 
from reaching the goal include:
•	 Puzzles (specific physical obstacles in the game world)
•	 Other characters (non-player characters and other players in a multi-player game)
•	 Player limitations (the player’s own lack of skills needed to overcome obstacles 
and other characters)
Once players know the goal they’re trying to achieve in a game, their path to that 
goal should be as challenging as possible. If players can reach the goal too quickly, 
the game won’t be fun to play. If players get frustrated from too many obstacles 
blocking their path, they’ll stop playing. Thus games need to give players a gradual 
sense of progressing without being too easy or too hard.
Obstacles serve two purposes:
•	 They prevent players from reaching a goal too easily
•	 They force players to use new skills to overcome the obstacle
Puzzles represent physical obstacles that players must overcome. These can be as 
simple as pits or walls that players must learn to jump over, or they can be as com­
plicated as a locked door that can only be opened if players guess the right 
combination.
Any physical obstacle represents a puzzle that players must analyze to determine 
the best way around it. By trying to get past an obstacle, players must either learn 
new skills or practice variations of existing skills. Only by mastering new skills can 
the player get past the obstacles and be ready for the next obstacle in the way.
Obstacles are generally static and predictable. Other characters (NPCs and other 
players) are mobile and unpredictable, especially when controlled by other humans. 
Characters force players to adapt to different challenges and develop new skills in 
the process.
Perhaps the most important reason players cannot reach their goals too easily is 
the player’s own limitations. Think of every obstacle (physical or other characters) 
as a malicious teacher. They exist solely to expose the player’s limitations and force 
the player to acknowledge those weaknesses to improve them.
15  Fun in Storytelling

145
Story helps give obstacles meaning. Having a wall block your way can be dis­
couraging, but if that wall is part of a prison and you’ve been falsely imprisoned by 
an evil dictator who plans to wipe out your family, suddenly getting past that same 
wall has far more emotional meaning. It’s the same wall, but what that wall repre­
sents is more than just a simple obstacle.
Stories provide further details on what obstacles represent and give players a 
purpose for overcoming them. The best obstacles are difficult precisely because 
they attack the player’s greatest weakness at that moment. Then stories provide 
motivation for the player to overcome that obstacle beyond just the physical barrier 
to a goal.
Thus the purpose of stories in a game is to provide both a physical path and an 
emotional journey towards a goal.
Thought Exercise
Pick an early arcade game. Even though early arcade games could only provide 
simple gameplay (to make it easy for novices to learn), many of them still provide a 
simple story beyond the physical nature of the game. For example, strip out the 
animated characters in Pac-Man and you wind up with the player controlling a blob, 
eating dots in a maze, while trying to avoid other blobs. Even though Pac-Man lacks 
a story, its use of animated characters provides a simple story for players to 
understand.
Identify the story provided by an early arcade game. Strip out this story in this 
early arcade game. Would it still be as fun to play?
Pick a recent video game and identify the story. What type of obstacles must the 
player overcome, that’s related to the story? How does each different type of obsta­
cle (including other characters) force the player to learn and master a new skill?
The Importance of Plot in a Story
At the very least, a story defines the setting of a game and the reason for striving 
towards a specific goal. However, story can also define what happens, which is simi­
lar to a plot in ordinary fiction.
Plot describes what happens to the hero. Ordinary fiction offers a linear plot so 
no matter how many times someone watches “Star Wars” or reads “The Hunger 
Games,” what happens to the hero never changes.
However in video games, players control the hero. That means the game’s 
designers must decide how tightly they want to control the plot. In some games, all 
players go through the same major experiences and the choices they make may 
affect minor details (such as how NPCs react), but never affect the overall plot. Such 
story-driven games are most similar to ordinary fiction (books, movies, TV shows) 
in that all players experience the same plot no matter what they do.
The Importance of Plot in a Story

146
On the other extreme, open world games use story to provide a setting but allow 
players to define their own plots based entirely on their choices. Elden Ring’s story 
defines a fantasy world where players can raid dungeons, craft swords and arrows to 
sell, or cast magic spells. Grand Theft Auto’s story puts players in a fictional 
Southern California city where they can steal cars, rob banks, and sell drugs.
The story setting defines the type of activities the game offers. Yet the story’s plot 
creates a goal for all players to achieve. In such open worlds, players don’t have to 
follow the plot since they can freely explore the open world, but the plot gives play­
ers a direction and hence a goal to achieve. Without such a goal, players would 
likely quickly tire of aimlessly exploring the game world with no purpose.
The stronger the story in defining the hero and the setting, the more defined the 
plot that gives players a goal. The less defined a hero and setting might be, the less 
of a plot players need to follow. Minecraft’s story is much less defined. As a result, 
players can do anything they wish with no single plot to guide players toward 
achieving a specific goal.
In Minecraft, players create their own goals to pursue. In other games like Elden 
Ring or Grand Theft Auto, the story defines the setting and a loose plot that players 
can follow if they wish.
To prevent plot from forcing players to follow specific actions in a fixed order, 
many games offer side quests. The purpose of side quests is to allow players to devi­
ate from the main plot and choose other actions they wish to take within the game 
world. This gives players the feeling of freedom while still being constrained by the 
plot of the story.
So plot in a game can vary from restrictive (everyone must follow specific events 
in a specific order) to loose (everyone is free to ignore the plot if they wish, but the 
plot creates a long-term goal to pursue).
Plot is a tradeoff between telling a linear story with only one outcome to telling 
a non-linear story that may have multiple outcomes. Plots can vary from linear to 
non-linear with side quests or player-defined quests available to vary the flow:
•	 Plot types
•	 Linear plot - Everyone experiences the same events in a specific order
•	 Non-linear plot - Following the plot is optional, but provides a long-term goal 
to pursue
•	 Quest types
•	 Side quests that deviate from the main plot but offer mini-plots of their own
•	 Player-defined quests
Thought Exercise
Pick a video game that you’ve completed and identify the type of plot the game had, 
a strictly linear plot or a non-linear plot. If the game offered side quests, why did 
you play or not play them? If the game lets players make up their own quests, how 
does the story affect the game setting and define the hero that the player controls?
15  Fun in Storytelling

147
Summary
Stories create fun by defining interesting new worlds for players to explore, identi­
fying a goal for players to achieve, and shaping the path past obstacles towards that 
particular goal. Stories need a hero within a specific setting. The hero defines the 
type of setting and vice versa because every hero type creates certain expectations.
All stories need a hero, a setting, and a plot. The hero defines who players con­
trol, the setting defines where the game takes place, and the plot defines the order 
that players confront various obstacles and non-player characters.
Stories give meaning to the players actions. The more compelling the story, the 
more appealing the game. Stories provide motivation for players to play a game by 
letting them live in an alternate world of their fantasies.

Understanding the elements that make up a game can help you appreciate how 
games work (and how bad games fail). Knowing the different ways games create 
challenges that players find fun to overcome can help you better understand the 
mechanics of games. However, if you want to design and create games, you need to 
know how to make, test, and market them as well.
Designing a game requires the same types of skill as painting a picture, writing a 
novel, or filming a movie. First, you have to believe you can create something out­
side of yourself. Second, you need to visualize what you want to make. Third, you 
need to develop the skills and knowledge to build what you imagine. Fourth, you 
have to actually take action and do it.
Game design is nothing more than a skill where you can combine your talent and 
imagination to create something the world has never seen before. As a novice, your 
skill and knowledge might not equal the experts, but through time, practice, and 
constant learning, you can improve your skills, increase your knowledge, and gain 
crucial experience with each game you design. Game design is nothing more than a 
skill that anyone can develop.
Designing a game is just one step. Publicizing a game is an entirely different skill 
and making money from a game is yet another completely different, but related 
skillset. Some people might be happy just playing games, but others might want to 
try their hand at designing games.
Yet for many others, designing games can be more than a hobby; it can be an 
entire career. Game design is a legitimate field. This part of the book is meant to 
help you take your game ideas, bring them to life, and show them to the world.
Whether you make a little or a lot of money from your game designs is far less 
important than just the enjoyment of making a game in the first place. For many 
people, making games can be just as challenging and enjoyable as playing games. If 
you want to design a game, you can, and this part of the book will show you how.

Turning a Game Idea into a Real Game
Coming up with an idea for a game essentially points you in the direction you want 
to go. The next step is deciding how you want to implement your idea and turn it 
into an actual working game. Two main ways to create a game are:
•	 Paper
•	 Digital
Paper-based games can be card games and board games, but you can also think of 
sports as large paper-based games where the playing pieces are actual people. Paper-­
based games require physical playing fields and physical playing pieces.
Digital games are games that run entirely on a computer. Digital games can com­
pletely emulate paper-based games but they commonly create interactive experi­
ences that could not be possible with a paper-based game. One common advantage 
of digital games is the ability to allow a single person to play against the computer. 
Such solitary play is rarely possible with paper-based games that require human 
opponents.
Another advantage of digital games is that they test a player’s eye-hand coordi­
nation and reflexes. The only type of paper-based game that also tests eye-hand 
coordination and reflexes are physical games like sports.
When translating your game idea into an actual working game, consider the pros 
and cons of each type of game.
Types of Paper-Based Games
Paper-based games are much easier to make than digital games. The three types of 
paper-based games are:

•	 Card games
•	 Board games
•	 Sports
Card games emphasize randomness and relationships between information dis­
played on cards. Because cards can only display a limited amount of information, 
card games often have simple rules where the bulk of the gameplay stems from the 
unpredictable and wide variety of interactions that can occur when players play 
their cards.
Board games and sports emphasize a playing field of some kind. Unlike card 
games, board games may involve an element of chance or not (such as chess or 
checkers), but sports always involve an element of chance.

When considering how to implement your game idea, focus on the core mechanic 
of your game idea. The four most common game mechanics are:
•	 Movement
•	 Combat
•	 Resource management
•	 Puzzle solving
Racing games emphasize movement, fighting games emphasize combat, organiza­
tion simulation games emphasize resource management, and adventure games 
emphasize puzzle solving. Most games emphasize a single core mechanic but rely 
on one or more secondary mechanics as well.

16  Turning a Game Idea into a Real Game

For example, a racing game could be implemented as a card game (Mille Bornes), 
a board game (Formula D), or a sport (Indy 500). In all three types of games, the 
core mechanic is movement.
What matters is the secondary mechanic that will define which type of game will 
be best. As a card game, Mille Bornes lets players practice resource management 
(collecting and hoarding cards) to slow down their opponents (combat).
In the board game, Formula D, players must choose different gears (puzzle solv­
ing) for their car to maximize their chance for crossing the finish line based on their 
current location on the track and likely numbers that will appear on die rolls.
In the actual Indy 500 race, players race cars around a track and test their dexter­
ity skills along with managing fuel (resource management) and maneuvering around 
their opponents (puzzle solving).
To find the core mechanic for your game, start by defining the purpose of your 
game idea (such as movement for a racing game). Then define a secondary mechanic. 
Knowing this secondary mechanic, look for the best way to implement this second­
ary mechanic and that will point to the best type of paper-based game for your idea.
Thought Exercise
Think of your game idea. Identify the purpose of the game, which will define its 
core mechanic (movement, combat, resource management, or puzzle solving).
Now think of a secondary game mechanic you also want to emphasize. Once you 
know this secondary game mechanic, determine which type of game would best 
serve this secondary game mechanic (card game, board game, or sport).
If you want a completely skill-based game, you may want to create a board game 
(like chess or Go). If you want a game that emphasizes chance and resource man­
agement, choose a card game or a board game. If you want a game that emphasizes 
physical dexterity, choose a sport.
The core game mechanic defines the game purpose but the secondary game 
mechanic shapes how to implement that idea into a working paper-based game.
Types of Digital Games
Digital games require a computer, and that immediately makes them harder to cre­
ate than paper-based games. Despite this barrier, digital games offer multiple advan­
tages over paper-based games.
First, digital games can be played alone using the computer as an opponent. 
Second, digital games can be played with multiple players around the world, which 
is not possible with paper-based games. Third, digital games offer real-time action 
that only a sport game can match.
Types of Digital Games

154
Perhaps the biggest advantage of digital games is that they can create visually 
stunning worlds for players to explore, which paper-based games cannot do except 
through invoking players’ imaginations in paper and pencil role-playing games like 
Dungeons & Dragons. As technology continues to advance, graphics will get 
increasingly more immersive with realistic sounds and imagery (such as through 
virtual reality headsets).
When creating a digital game, define the purpose of your game. This purpose 
defines the core mechanic of your game:
•	 Movement
•	 Combat
•	 Resource management
•	 Puzzle solving
Suppose you want to make a game that explores surviving in different types of harsh 
climates. There might be some combat involving hunting animals or fighting off 
larger predators like bears, but the main action of the game could be puzzle solving 
such as finding and building shelter, getting food and water, and traveling across 
snow, rivers, or deserts without dying.
Defining your game’s core mechanic indirectly defines the obstacles and chal­
lenges that players must overcome. A game emphasizing movement (such as a rac­
ing game) will include obstacles and enemies that can slow down or block movement. 
A game emphasizing combat will include enemies that can kill you first. A game 
emphasizing resource management will threaten to drain your resources faster than 
you can replenish them. A game emphasizing puzzle solving will try to stump you 
so you cannot solve the puzzle.
Once you identify the core mechanic that players will do most often, then you 
can define how to present your game’s challenges to the player based on the purpose 
of your game. In other words, what will players experience through playing 
your game?
When creating a video game, identify the following:
•	 The game’s purpose
•	 How that game’s purpose shapes the core mechanic
•	 How that game’s purpose shapes the obstacles and enemies
•	 What secondary mechanics help the player
Every video game needs a purpose and a tone. The purpose shapes its unique back­
ground story (genre) to appeal to certain audiences and define the entire gameplay. 
The tone shapes how that video game should express itself for players to experience.
For example, suppose you create a video game about ornithopter racing. 
(Ornithopters were early attempts to build flying machines that flapped their wings 
like birds.) The game purpose would be to highlight ornithopters and perhaps focus 
on historical ornithopters that people actually built. The tone could be comical with 
cartoonish graphics, or realistic in a Steampunk setting.
The combination of purpose and tone would then define the types of obstacles 
players would need to overcome. Perhaps players would need to constantly flap 
16  Turning a Game Idea into a Real Game

155
their ornithopter wings to stay in the air. Maybe cartoon birds might collide with the 
flying ornithopters in mid-air. Maybe rain and wind could blow ornithopters off 
course. Maybe balloons could get in the way.
By clearly defining the game’s purpose (game setting) and tone (how that game 
setting is presented), defining the type of obstacles and enemies becomes easy and 
specific. Even though navigating a cartoon ornithopter across the screen may be 
similar to other types of comical flying games, the obstacles should be unique to that 
particular game setting, which would be obstacles from that same time period as 
ornithopters.
Pick another game idea such as baking pies where the goal might be to bake pies 
based on different customer orders that keep changing such as apple, blueberry, 
peach, or boysenberry pies. The goal is to bake and sell pies that people want with­
out getting stuck with too many pies customers don’t want, which will get too old 
and be thrown out, wasting money.
If baking pies is the game’s purpose, the tone could be whimsical and light-­
hearted so obstacles could be getting the right ingredients mixed in the right order 
while mice sneak in to steal food or rival bakers or shoplifters try to steal whole pies. 
In this case, the challenge would be keeping pies fresh enough to sell without bak­
ing the wrong types of pies, and making the most money in the end.
Once you have the game’s core mechanic defined and shaped into the player’s 
actions, think of what secondary mechanics could help the player. For example, in 
the ornithopter example, the core mechanic would be movement. Thus any second­
ary mechanic could be combat, resource management, or puzzle solving.
Combat might be a useful secondary mechanic by letting players shoot down 
enemies or even other players. Combat could be particular challenging (and comi­
cal) since it would require players to keep the wings of their ornithopters flapping 
while trying to aim and shoot at the same time.
In the pie baking example, the core mechanic would be resource management in 
using limited available ingredients to bake different types of pies. A secondary 
game mechanic could be movement, combat, or puzzle solving. If this secondary 
game mechanic involves puzzle solving, players might have to figure out different 
ways to grab ingredients and combine them in the shortest amount of time. If this 
secondary game mechanic involves movement, then pies might be on a conveyor 
belt and players would have to keep moving to grab them before they fell off the end 
of the conveyor belt.
By clearly defining the game’s purpose and tone, it’s much easier to define the 
types of obstacles and enemies players will need to overcome. By identifying a 
secondary game mechanic, it’s easy to define what could help or harm the player’s 
chances of succeeding in the game.
Types of Digital Games

156
Thought Exercise
Pick an idea for a game and define its purpose, which shapes the game’s setting and 
background. Knowing this setting and background, what would be obstacles and 
enemies unique to this setting and background?
What is the tone of the game? How will the tone shape the appearance of 
the game?
The purpose of your game should identify its core game mechanic (Movement, 
Combat, Resource management, or Puzzle solving). Use the remaining three game 
mechanics to define a secondary game mechanic, which can shape ways to help or 
hinder the player.
Choosing a Video Game Type
Once you’re clear what your game’s purpose might be, its core game mechanic (to 
define obstacles and enemies), and its secondary game mechanic (to define ways to 
help or hinder the player), the next step is deciding how to present this game to play­
ers. Three ways to create an experience through digital games are:
•	 Text-based perspective
•	 2D perspective
•	 3D perspective
16.1
Because text-based games lack real-time interaction, they’re best for forcing 
players to think more strategically. Players must choose between various options 
throughout the game, which can trigger unexpected consequences later in the game. 
Players must also manage their limited resources to reach their goal. Thus text-­
based games are best for Resource management and Puzzle solving (not necessarily 
Movement or Combat except in an abstract manner).
­
­
16.2
­
3D perspective gives players greater freedom of movement up/down, left/right, 
and forward/backward. Because a 3D perspective can display a more realistic world, 
16  Turning a Game Idea into a Real Game

Choosing a Video Game Type

158
graphics tend to vary from stylish and abstract to ultra-realistic. The tradeoff is that 
creating 3D games is much harder than creating 2D games.
Both 2D and 3D games can emphasize Movement and Combat as core game 
mechanics in ways that text-based games can never do. The main difference between 
the two is that 2D games often represent simplified worlds while 3D games tend to 
represent more realistic worlds.
Since 2D games display simpler graphics, they tend to focus less on exploring 
and more on combat, such as exploring a dungeon to steal treasure while fighting or 
running away from monsters. 2D games emphasize more simplified gameplay.
16.3
A flying simulation as a 2D game might let players fly up, down, back, and forth 
using simple controls. A similar flying simulation as a 3D game might display 
detailed cockpit controls that mimics a real airplane.
­
16.2
Card games, board games, and sports are meant to be played multiple times. 
Video games are different. Some video games are meant to be played once. After 
playing the video game once, players will know what to expect so the game often 
loses much of its appeal for replaying multiple times because the game never varies 
its challenges.

Table 16.2  Comparing different types of video games
Game type Advantage
Disadvantage
Text-based 
games
Easy to create since the game focuses on 
choices (puzzle solving) and resource 
management.
Allows creating a game without the need for 
extensive programming or graphics skills.
Generally not a good choice for 
movement or Combat game 
mechanics.
Lack of interaction and graphics 
appeals to a smaller niche audience.
2D games
Offers simple game rules that makes games 
easy for designers to create and players to 
learn.
Graphics can range from crude drawings to 
stylish images.
Takes more time to create than 
text-based games.
Requires programming, audio, and 
graphics skills.
3D games
Offers realistic and immersive game worlds 
for players to explore.
Graphics can range from stylish images to 
realistic and detailed images.
Takes far more time to create than 
2D games.
Typically requires a team of people 
with different and unique skills.
Video games designed for single play typically focus on surprises and specific 
emotional experiences. Horror, romance, and mystery video games often fall in this 
category because the game provides specific information in a fixed order. The first 
time playing the game, everything is new and a mystery, but each repeated play 
makes the game less enjoyable since players remember the location of traps and 
surprises, thereby stripping the game of any further excitement and sense of 
exploration.
However, some video games are specifically meant to be played multiple times, 
much like card or board games. Such video games may play the same, but the 
options in each game are nearly endless, creating new challenges no matter how 
many times they’re played.
For example, a battle royale game may always pit two teams of players to fight 
in the same battlefields. Since players on both teams are humans with their own 
unique playing styles, no two games can ever be the same, increasing the appeal for 
repeated play.

Summary
When creating a game, it’s important to start with your game’s purpose, which can 
help define the core game mechanic your game emphasizes (Movement, Combat, 
Resource management, or Puzzle solving). Knowing the core game mechanic helps 
define the types of obstacles and enemies players must overcome to reach a goal.
A secondary game mechanic can provide ways to help or hinder players. By 
combining a core game mechanic with a story setting and a tone, you can create a 
unique game.
Two ways to implement any game idea is through paper-based designs or digital 
designs. Paper-based games include card games, board games, and even sports. 
Digital games include text-based video games, 2D video games, and 3D video games.
Paper-based games are the easiest to create, but can be cumbersome to simulate 
games in great detail. Digital games are harder to create but offer real-time interac­
tion and greater immersion in a fictional game world.
The type of game you create depends on your game idea, your game designing 
skill, and the best way to implement your idea into an actual working game. The 
combination of background story, tone, core game mechanic, and secondary game 
mechanic helps define a unique game.

Chapter 17
Prototyping
Artists sketch ideas before committing themselves to applying actual paint. Writers 
jot down ideas in outlines before writing a novel, screenplay, or stage play. 
Filmmakers hire artists to sketch out storyboards to visually describe the major 
action before they shoot the final scene. In all cases, professionals start with a rough 
draft so they can examine whether it works or not.
Rough drafts serve several important purposes. First, rough drafts let you quickly 
create and test ideas. That way you can discard ideas that don’t work. Often times 
ideas that initially sound great wind up failing when put into actual practice. Other 
times an idea may not quite work the way you expected, so a rough draft can iden­
tify those problems early so you can fix them.
Second, because rough drafts are meant to be created quickly, they’re disposable, 
which means it’s far easier to change ideas drastically as a rough draft early rather 
than trying to change it later. Disposable rough drafts help ensure designers don’t 
get emotionally attached to any one idea just because they spent a lot of time 
making it.
In the world of game design, creating rough drafts is known as prototyping. 
Rather than go from an initial idea to a completed game (which is nearly impossible 
for all but the simplest of games), it’s far better to start with a rough draft and create 
one or more prototypes first. A prototype is nothing more than a simple version of a 
game, or part of a game, that lets you test out your ideas to see if they work or not.
17.1
There are two main types of prototypes:
•	 Paper prototypes
•	 Digital prototypes

Paper prototypes are created using nothing more than paper and pencil along with 
dice to create random numbers. Paper prototypes let you test your ideas quickly 
without any type of programming whatsoever. For example, a game designer might 
use a paper prototype to create a map of a game world and then move playing pieces 
on the map to identify areas that are too difficult or too easy to move through.
Because paper prototypes cost little to make and can be created easily and 
quickly, designers can try out multiple ideas in rapid succession. This increases the 
chance of finding the best idea to use rather than just settling for the first idea that 
comes to mind.
While paper prototypes can help shape a game in the early stages, they cannot 
accurately simulate certain types of video games such as games that rely on real-­
time movement. That’s why game designers often test their ideas using paper proto­
types and then transfer that prototype later to a digital prototype.
A digital prototype can not only let designers play the video game in a crude 
state, but digital prototypes let designers test out different user interface designs 
along with testing out any artificial intelligence (AI) code needed to move enemy 
units. If a video game needs to support multiple players online, a digital prototype 
can test this feature out as well, which a paper prototype could never do. For creat­
ing video games, digital prototypes are a must.
Although digital prototypes can give immediate feedback while playing, digital 
prototypes take much longer to create than paper prototypes. A simple digital pro­
totype might just test out different user interface designs so images can be static and 
clickable.
A more complicated digital prototype might need to test out movement and com­
bat, which can require simple graphic elements to represent the player and any 
enemies. Plus a digital prototype will often require someone to write code to make 
the digital prototype actually work.
Although digital prototypes can give testers a much better feel for how different 
aspects of a video game idea might work, the time needed to create (and debug) a 
digital prototype can be time-consuming. Because creating digital prototypes takes 
time, there’s a risk designers will test fewer ideas and embrace mediocre ideas just 
because of the time needed to create the digital prototype.
Since digital prototypes often involve writing code, there’s the temptation to con­
vert the prototype into the actual game. While this can be possible, it’s often far 
better to start from scratch. The prototype exists solely to test if a particular idea 
works or not. Because the prototype can be created quickly, any coding will likely 
not be organized or designed for the future. So code in digital prototypes can help 
designers see what works, but then it’s usually better to rewrite the code from 
scratch in the actual project. That way you can plan ahead and design your program 
properly.
17  Prototyping

163
For card and board games, paper prototypes are crucial to test out ideas. For a 
video game, a paper prototype is necessary to test out early ideas. Once those early 
ideas work, then designers can create digital prototypes to further refine the best of 
these early ideas. Ideally, a prototype should contain as little as possible except for 
the features the prototype needs to test.
Thought Exercise
Identify one feature in a card or board game and come up with three alternate ways 
that feature could work by creating paper prototypes of each alternate idea.
Identify one feature in a video game and come up with three alternate ways that 
feature could work by creating a paper prototype of each alternate idea.
Examine the user interface of a video game and create a simple digital prototype 
that displays the different user interface screens and shows how these different user 
interface elements work together such as showing the main screen connecting to a 
settings screen.
What to Prototype
The purpose of prototyping is to test out an idea, either if the idea will work or how 
to optimize that idea to make it better. Prototypes aren’t meant to test an entire 
game. Instead, prototypes are meant to test parts of a game. When you’re satisfied 
that each part of a game works on its own, then you can combine the different parts 
to see how they work together.
So the parts of a game you may need to prototype are:
•	 The movement system
•	 The combat system
•	 The user interface
•	 The resource management system
•	 The inventory system
•	 The economic system
Identify the purpose of the game element and design a prototype to achieve that 
purpose. By using prototypes of any kind (paper or digital), designers can make a 
game in incremental stages to increase the chances that the entire game will be fun 
and challenging to play. Ultimately, the purpose of creating any prototype is to test 
a single idea by answering a single question such as:
•	 Will it work?
•	 What’s the best way to do it?
•	 What’s fun about the prototype?
What to Prototype

164
For example, if you’re planning to create a unique combat system, you need to pro­
totype the combat system to make sure it even works. Once you get the combat 
system to work, the next question to answer is whether the combat system could be 
better. Then go one step further, identify the element that’s most fun, and strip away 
the rest.
Many times, prototypes can identify game elements that might actually be better 
than the original design. Rockstar Games originally designed “Race n’ Chase” as a 
street car racing game where players could race on the streets of a city with police 
cars in hot pursuit. While testing the game, the developers noticed that the pursuing 
police cars could ram cars off the street and knock them into buildings. This proved 
more popular to watch and play that the company shifted the focus of the game and 
renamed it “Grand Theft Auto.”
Game designer Gabe Cuzzillo originally tried to create a time-loop, stealth game 
where players had to sneak through a maze without being detected. However if 
guards appeared, the player could grab and throw them against the wall. That game 
mechanic of throwing guards against the wall proved so appealing during testing 
that Gabe dropped the stealth and time-loop parts of the game and renamed the 
game “Ape Out.” Now players could control an ape and attack human guards by 
flinging them against the wall, which was what made the game fun to play.
The main purpose of prototypes is to convert vague, abstract game ideas into 
actual working systems. Instead of saying, “My game will simulate air battles 
between World War One German Zeppelins and British biplanes,” prototypes force 
you to actually define rules and create algorithms for how to move units and how to 
resolve combat.
With a working prototype, you can test if a game idea is even fun to play or not. 
With a prototype, you can show others exactly what your game is and how it works.
Always have a goal or question to answer when creating any prototype. Prototypes 
can identify whether a game mechanic works, how to optimize that game mechanic, 
or whether to focus on a specific game mechanic that’s more fun than anything else.
Thought Exercise
Pick an existing game and create a prototype of one system (such as its combat or 
movement system). What kind of game could you create based solely around this 
one game mechanic?
Pick a game that you don’t like and identify the most annoying element. Create 
a prototype of this game element and improve it so you would like playing it.
The Parts of a Prototype
Every prototype must define rules for how a particular game mechanic works. Thus 
the purpose of the prototype is to identify if these rules work the way you expect. If 
not, then you’ll need to modify these rules somehow by modifying a rule, deleting 
17  Prototyping

165
a rule, or adding completely new rules until the game mechanic works the way 
you want.
(Just remember that sometimes a flawed game mechanic can be more useful than 
the original design. Stay open to recognizing the benefits of any flawed rules because 
those flaws might actually point the way to a more interesting and better game.)
When creating paper prototypes, start with a question you want the prototype to 
answer. The prototype must answer the following:
•	 How does the prototype work in ideal circumstances?
•	 How does the prototype work in extreme circumstances?
Suppose a prototype tests combat. Imagine a common occurrence, such as a knight 
fighting an ogre, and test to make sure the game rules in the prototype work as 
expected. Then focus on extremes such as a knight fighting a far more powerful 
dragon or wizard. Do the combat rules still work?
Do the combat rules work when the player first starts the game and is relatively 
weak? Do the combat rules still work when the player is much stronger near the end 
of the game? Do the combat rules still work when the player is gradually progress­
ing through the middle of the game? Do the combat rules still work with every pos­
sible character and weapon at all stages of the game? By testing all possible 
situations, a prototype can identify problems as early as possible.
Creating a prototype forces you to define the rules of the game. The rules of the 
game must be clear enough so they can be written down and translated into step by 
step instructions that players or a computer can easily follow.
Rules must translate into specific data. In a military game, tanks can move faster 
than infantry, who are walking, but how much faster does a tank move compared to 
infantry? Prototypes force you to assign numeric values to different attributes so it’s 
clear a tank moves 4 times faster than infantry or cavalry moves half as fast as a 
tank. By assigning numeric values to every attribute, you can then adjust these 
numeric values to modify the way the rules work.
So the two most important parts of a prototype are:
•	 Rules (algorithms)
•	 Numeric values (attributes)
Rules define how part of a game works such as its movement or inventory system. 
Numeric values define how the rules work such as defining the movement speed 
of units.
If there’s a problem with the way a prototype works, you can fix the problem by 
either adjusting the rules or adjusting the numeric values of various attributes. 
Changing numeric values allows for minor adjustments. Changing rules allows for 
major adjustments.
All numeric values only make sense relative to one another. A strength of 10 
means nothing by itself, but if an armor unit has an attack strength of 10, it makes 
sense that an infantry unit would have a much weaker attack strength such as 4. If 
an infantry unity had a strength of 14 compared to an armor unit’s attack strength of 
10, the numeric values make it easy to see something isn’t right. Either the armor 
attack strength is too low or the infantry attack strength is too high (or both).
The Parts of a Prototype

166
When testing a prototype, the basic set of assumptions typically progress as 
follows:
	1.	 Assume the rules don’t work. Test and modify the rules for different situations 
until the prototype works as expected.
	2.	 Assume the rules work but the numeric values are wrong. Adjust the numeric 
values until the prototype works as expected.
	3.	 Assume the rules work and all numeric values are accurate. Test to make sure 
they work in all cases.
The purpose of a prototype isn’t to prove your assumptions about the rules and 
numeric values are right. If you assume your rules and numeric values are right, 
you’ll risk looking only for those cases where both the rules and numeric values 
work as expected. In other words, you’ll try to prove you’re right by ignoring and 
overlooking situations where your assumptions could be completely wrong.
It’s far better to assume your rules and numeric values are completely wrong. 
Then use the prototype to test if they really are wrong or not. This subtle shift in 
mindset forces you to assume every rule and numeric value is wrong, so you must 
keep looking to prove if they are wrong. When you can no longer prove they’re 
wrong, then you’ll most likely have proven that the rules and numeric values 
are right.
Don’t try to prove your assumptions (rules and numeric values) are right. Always 
try to prove your assumptions are wrong. This will help you actively look for flaws 
that you can fix now before they get much harder to fix later.
Thought Exercise
Think of a simple game mechanic (movement, combat, resource management, etc.) 
and jot down rules for how it will work and assign any numeric values to any attri­
butes needed such as speed, attack strength, size, or whatever is most important to 
your chosen game mechanic.
Do your rules cover all possible situations? How did you assign numeric values 
to any attributes?

17.3
Although paper wargames may look complicated (and they are), the detailed 
rules, numeric values, and tables are actually hidden as code inside video games. To 
better understand how video games must work to cover all possibilities, study how 
17  Prototyping

167
 
paper wargames work. The rules needed to create a video game are similar in com­
plexity and completeness to the rules needed to create a paper wargame.
Paper vs. Digital Prototypes
Paper prototypes are necessary when creating card or board games. However, paper 
prototypes can also be useful for creating video games as well. Paper prototypes can 
be easy to make within seconds using nothing more than paper, pencil, and a ran­
domizer like dice. Once a paper prototype proves it works, designers can then con­
vert that paper prototype into a digital prototype.
Digital prototypes require a computer and coding, typically using a game engine 
such as Unity or GameMaker Studio. The game engine takes care of details such as 
collisions between two objects and detecting input from a keyboard, touch screen, 
or game controller. That way you can focus on defining the game element you want 
to test in the prototype.
Paper vs. Digital Prototypes

168
 
 
Even better, game engines can often create games for a variety of platforms such 
as Windows, Linux, macOS, iOS, Android, and HTML. That means if you create a 
prototype on a computer, the game engine can convert that prototype to run on any 
computer, a smartphone, or a browser. This lets you test a digital prototype on the 
actual hardware you want your completed game to run on as well.
Because digital prototypes rely on game engines, they require familiarity with a 
particular game engine and often some basic coding skills in a programming lan­
guage such as C#, C++, Lua, or a programming language specific to that particular 
game engine. No matter how familiar you may be with a game engine or how good 
you may be at coding, creating a digital prototype will always be slower than creat­
ing a paper prototype.
­
17.4
Creating a digital prototype will take time. The key is to keep the graphics simple 
so you can focus on how the game works rather than how the game looks at this 
stage. Since writing code can be time-intensive (especially if you’re not familiar 
with programming), an alternative to text-based coding is visual programming. (All 
game engines allow designers to program them using text-based programming lan­
guages like C# or C++. Most, but not all, game engines also let designers program 
a game engine using visual programming.)

However, visual programming graphs have several disadvantages compared to 
text-based programming languages. First, visual graphs take longer to create. 
Second, visual graphs often require an additional layer of interpretation. That means 
visual graphs can run up to 100 times slower than text-based programs, especially 
for intensive mathematical calculations.
Third, visual graphs take up space. The more the visual graph needs to do such 
as calculate mathematical formulas or detect input from different types of devices, 
the larger and more complicated the visual graph will get. This makes visual graphs 
harder to modify and expand over time. Adding more code to a text-based language 
means adding more lines of text. Adding more code to a visual graph means draw­
ing more nodes and connections between each node, creating a spaghetti-like jum­
ble that gets increasingly harder to read and understand.
It’s possible to program a game engine using just text-based programming lan­
guages, just visual graphs, or a combination of the two. Digital prototypes are sim­
ply another tool for prototyping video game elements, but they take longer to create 
and require more skill to make than paper prototypes.
Thought Exercise
Many video games, such as Portal, Doom, and Fallout, have been turned into board 
games. Study these video games and examine their board game versions. How could 
the board game versions have worked as paper prototypes to mimic gameplay in a 
video game?
Thought Exercise

170
Many board games (such as Monopoly, Battleship, and The Game of Life) have 
also been turned into video games. Generally the video game version of a board 
game simply lets the computer handle the rules, movement of pieces, and dice rolls. 
How could these board games have been tested using a digital prototype?
Summary
Everyone has an idea for a game, but ideas mean nothing until you’re willing to do 
the hard work of turning that idea into a working and playable game. Nobody takes 
a game idea and makes a flawless game in one step. Instead, game designers create 
prototypes to test out different parts of their ideas until they’re satisfied they 
might work.
Prototypes define rules and numeric values assigned to different attributes. All 
numeric values are arbitrary values that make sense when compared to other attri­
butes of the game. By modifying the rules and numeric values of attributes, you can 
modify how a prototype works.
Prototypes should be created quickly without regard to their appearance. Because 
prototypes can be so easy to make, there’s less attachment to keeping them. The 
more prototypes you create, the more ideas you can test in a short amount of time. 
Each prototype should be created as simple as possible to test one aspect of the game.
Paper prototypes can be created using pencil, paper, and randomizer items such 
as dice. Digital prototypes can be created on a computer using a game engine. Card 
and board games likely only need paper prototypes but video games need both paper 
prototypes and digital prototypes.
The whole purpose of a prototype is to force you to take an abstract idea for a 
game and define rules and attributes that clearly explain how that game will actu­
ally work.

Card Game Prototypes
Card games mostly involve playing with information printed directly on each card. 
As a result, card game prototypes must test the size and information displayed on 
each card. Displayed information must be consistent to make it easy for players to 
find the information they need at a glance, but not too overwhelming to make the 
game hard to understand.
In some cases, there might be a playing field of some kind where the cards must 
be placed and arranged, but for the most part, the main purpose of a card game pro­
totype is to test the interaction between different cards to make sure the game is 
balanced, offers players multiple choices (strategies) to pursue, and constantly 
changes each turn to provide variety.
Card games, like all types of games, focus on three elements:
•	 Offense – Playing one or more cards to get closer to winning or improve the 
chances of winning.
•	 Defense – Playing one or more cards to stop other players from getting closer to 
winning.
•	 Management – Choosing the cards to keep and discard to improve your chances 
of winning.
In simple card games, players may not have all three options available. In blackjack, 
players mostly focus on offense (trying to get as close to 21 as possible without 
going over) and management (deciding whether to get another card, use an ace as a 
1 or 11, or split cards). Blackjack players can never block other players from win­
ning except indirectly by getting cards that other players might need.
In more complicated card games, players can choose from all three options. In 
poker, players try to collect the highest scoring hand (offense) and decide which 
cards to keep and which to discard (management). By placing large bets or bluffing, 
players can drive other players out of the game (defense).
When designing a card game, designers must define:

•	 The different card types
•	 The relationships that define interactions between card types
•	 The game structure (number of players, fixed-length vs. no time limit goal)
•	 The card gameplay
Card games start by shuffling multiple cards in a deck. The game puts all players on 
an equal footing by giving everyone the same number of cards. However, the ran­
dom nature of shuffling changes which cards each player gets, and that determines 
whether one player has an initial advantage over another.
Now it’s up to each player to use their skill with the cards they’ve been dealt to 
create the greatest chance for winning. This combination of random chance and 
skill keeps card games interesting for beginners and experts alike.
Thought Exercise
Examine three different card games that can be played with an ordinary 52-card 
deck. How does each game handle the different values and suits (club, diamond, 
heart, spade) of the cards?
Examine a card game that uses its own cards. Why does this card game require 
its own cards? Are these cards as versatile as cards in a typical 52-card deck?
Setting Up a Card Game
Like board games and to a lesser extent with video games, card games are meant to 
bring people together. For that reason, card games (with the exception of solitaire) 
emphasize player interaction with each other.
Board games are often races where players try to reach a goal before anyone else. 
Video games can be played alone or with groups of people who players may never 
physically see or meet. Card games give people a reason to directly interact with 
each other, making card games more social than most other types of games. When 
designing a card game, keep this social aspect in mind.
Card game play revolves around three stages:
•	 Setting up the cards
•	 Playing the cards (Getting cards, discarding cards, and applying cards to help get 
the player closer to winning.)
•	 Defining a winner
Every card game requires a setup stage. Setting up the cards can be as simple as 
shuffling a deck of cards to randomize their position, or as complicated as creating 
your own deck of cards that may contain different cards from your opponent’s deck, 
such as in Magic: The Gathering.
18  Card Game Prototypes

175
In most card games, players start off with an equal number of cards but the cards 
themselves may differ although there’s still a chance players could get equivalent 
cards. In blackjack, both players could get 21 with an ace and a king, queen, jack, 
or 10. Even though only one player can hold an ace of hearts, the other player could 
have an ace of diamonds, clubs, or spades, which has the exact same value.
In Magic: The Gathering, players create their own decks. Not only is it extremely 
rare for players to build decks with identical cards, but it’s even less likely that two 
players would deal themselves the exact same cards as well.
Card game setups almost always create unbalanced hands among players. In 
poker, it’s possible to get dealt such a poor hand that it’s nearly impossible to win. 
However, poker typically involves playing multiple hands. That way a single bad 
hand won’t cause a player to lose the entire game.
Ideally, any hand players get can be a potentially winning hand with the right 
amount of skill in playing the cards. Even if skillful players can’t turn a losing hand 
into a winning hand all the time, they can tilt the odds in their favor often enough to 
partially offset bad luck. Ultimately, skill, not luck, should determine the winner.
Thought Exercise
Card games typically start with an equal number of cards for each player. However, 
the contents of those cards can differ in the following ways:
•	 Cards usually different, but possibly equivalent (such as blackjack)
•	 Cards almost always different (such as Magic: The Gathering)
Can you think of a card game that begins by giving players an unequal number of 
cards? Can you think of a card game that begins by giving players identical cards?
The Game Sequence of a Card Game
Once a card game has been set up, the main gameplay involves evaluating, manage­
ment, and application. After each player gets dealt a random set of cards, the first 
step is evaluating what they have.
If players have been dealt cards from the same deck, each player automatically 
knows which cards an opponent cannot possibly have. In poker, if one player has the 
three aces, there’s no way any other player can have anything more than one ace. 
This knowledge of their own cards and the number of those type of cards in the deck 
can give each player an edge.
As cards get used up, players can use “card counting” where they keep track of 
which cards remain. In blackjack, card counting lets players make increasingly 
accurate predictions on which cards they could draw because they know which 
cards are no longer in play. To prevent this, games often have large numbers of cards

to make card counting difficult, or shuffle cards after each play to eliminate card 
counting altogether.
In Magic: The Gathering, each player creates their own deck and draws cards 
from their own deck. As a result, each player has no idea what cards are in each 
other’s deck. This makes “card counting” impossible, increasing the challenge of 
the game. Part of the challenge lies in creating a deck with the best combinations of 
cards that work together.
Once players get dealt their cards, the second step involves managing those 
cards. The initial hand each player gets dealt will rarely be optimal. So the challenge 
lies in deciding which cards to keep and use, and in some cases, which cards to 
discard.
At this point, another challenge comes from seeing the cards an opponent plays 
and deciding which cards to play in response. This third step involves playing or 
applying a card to improve your own chances of winning or hurting another player’s 
chances of winning.
Ideally, players will have the perfect card to counter their opponent’s last card, 
but in most cases, players must choose which card to play, balancing the idea 
between using their best card now or holding it back to deal with a potentially 
greater threat in the future. Based on the currently held cards and the opponent’s 
cards, players must determine how to use their hand (known information) against 
their opponent’s possible future moves (unknown information).
Gameplay in a card game often involves this repetitive loop of getting cards, 
evaluating them, and using them. The challenge is knowing which cards to use 
and when.
Thought Exercise
Pick a card game that uses an ordinary 52-card deck and identify the repetitive 
gameplay. For example, poker’s repetitive loop involves getting dealt a hand, choos­
ing which cards to discard, drawing new cards, and then placing bets. What is the 
repetitive loop of the card game you chose?
Pick a card game that does not use an ordinary 52-card deck. What are the major 
categories of cards? What is the repetitive loop of this specific card game and how 
could this repetitive gameplay not be possible using an ordinary 52-card deck.
Defining the Winning Conditions of a Card Game
The first step in designing a card game is deciding how players can win. This goal 
directly shapes the purpose of the entire deck of cards. Winning conditions can be 
based on the following:
18  Card Game Prototypes

177
•	 Fixed number of turns vs. no fixed time length
•	 One or more paths to win
When a game ends after a fixed number of turns, this creates a “ticking time bomb” 
effect that forces players to take increasingly risky chances to win before time runs 
out. Think of any timed sport such as football or basketball that forces players to get 
ahead before a fixed time limit ends.
Most card games do not have a fixed time limit. Instead, these games can go on 
as long as the players want or until one player reaches a specific goal first. Essentially, 
games with no time limit act like racing games where the first person to reach a goal 
wins no matter how long it may take.
Some card games, such as blackjack or poker, consist of short games that can be 
played multiple times. Other card games take longer to play. In general, the simpler 
the rules, the shorter the game, which allows for multiple plays. The more games 
played, the less players can depend on luck to help them win.
Every game needs a goal for players to reach. Thus the game becomes a race to 
reach that goal first. However to add variety, some card games offer two or more 
ways to win. This creates uncertainty since someone almost at the goal can still lose.
In Mille Bornes, players must accumulate distance cards until they reach 1000, 
which defines a single path to winning. On the other hand, to win the Ticket to Ride 
card game, players must accumulate points to win. Since players can accumulate 
points in a variety of ways, this creates multiple strategies players can pursue to win 
the game.
When creating a card game, focus on how players win, whether there’s a fixed 
number of turns or whenever the first player reaches a goal. Also consider whether 
there is only one way to reach the goal or multiple ways. The goal of the game, plus 
the path (or paths) to that goal determine how the cards within a deck should be 
designed.
Thought Exercise
Pick a card game like blackjack that has no fixed time length to win. How would the 
game change if blackjack ended after a fixed number of hands such as ten? How 
would the game change if the game ended after the player has been dealt a fixed 
number of cards such as one hundred?
If a card game only has one way to win, how would that game change if there 
was another way to win? For example, the goal of blackjack is to get as close to 21 
without going over, but what if you could pay extra money to allow going over 21, 
such as paying an extra $10 per each additional number over 21. By paying $10, you 
could hit 22 or less and still win the game. By paying $20, you could hit 23 or less 
and still win the game.
Thought Exercise

178
Defining Card Types
What makes card games interesting are the types of cards available and their rela­
tionships that defines how they interact. In an ordinary 52-card deck, cards have two 
characteristics:
•	 A value (2-10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace)
•	 A suit (hearts, diamonds, clubs, spades)
The combination of values and suits makes each card unique since there can only be 
one 5 of spades or one 10 of diamonds. In some games, the suits make no difference 
such as in blackjack where a 4 of clubs is no different than a 4 of diamonds.
In other games, the combination of values and suits can make a huge difference. 
In poker, a 4 of clubs can spell the difference between a straight flush (five cards in 
sequential order of the same suit such as a 2 of clubs, 3, of clubs, 4 of clubs, 5 of 
clubs, and a 6 of clubs), or a much weaker straight (five cards in sequential order of 
any suit such as 2 of clubs, 3, of clubs, 4 of hearts, 5 of clubs, and a 6 of clubs).
When a card game defines its own unique cards, those cards are often divided 
into separate types or categories that serve different purposes such as cards for:
•	 Getting the player closer to winning
•	 Protecting chances of winning (or hindering an opponent’s chances of winning)
•	 Planning for the long-term future
Every card game must include cards that can get the player closer to achieving a 
specific goal to win the game. Such cards are essential such as in blackjack where 
the entire deck consists of cards with different numeric values ranging from 1-11.
Although adding the numeric values of cards together is the entire basis for 
blackjack, all games require choices. The more choices available to players, the 
greater the control players have over the game. If blackjack just consisted of adding 
cards together, the only choice would be whether to get more cards or not.
To add variety and give players additional choices, blackjack also lets players 
decide whether an ace should represent a 1 or an 11. An additional choice involves 
splitting hands if players get dealt two cards of identical values such as two aces or 
two 8 s. These additional rules for splitting hands or changing the value of an ace 
helps increase the player’s chances of winning without requiring any additional 
cards at all.
While most card games based on a typical 52-card deck focus on cards that get 
players closer to winning with options for increasing (or decreasing another play­
er’s) chance of winning, card games that rely on their own cards often include addi­
tional cards for increasing (or decreasing) a player’s chances of winning along with 
separate cards for improving a player’s chance of winning in the future.
In the card game Mille Bornes, the goal is to be the first player to reach 1000 
(measured in either miles or kilometers). Distance cards define the how far the 
player has travelled and represent the cards that get a player closer to winning.
18  Card Game Prototypes

179
To help or hinder winning, Mille Bornes contains additional cards called Hazards 
and Remedies. Hazards temporarily slow or halt another player’s progress while 
Remedies remove these Hazards. Hazards act like attack cards to hurt other players 
while Remedies act like defense cards to eliminate any Hazards other players have 
played against you.
18.1
Common card elements include:
•	 Card values
•	 Card modifiers
•	 Card relationships
•	 Wildcards
Cards typically represent a unit that the player controls, so card values define the 
strength of that unit. Ordinary playing cards range in value from 2 to 10 along with 
jack, queen, king, and ace. Because playing cards have a numeric value, they can 
also be used as a form randomization. Instead of rolling a die, players can draw a 
card to select a random number.
Cards unique to a particular game often include values as well that represent one 
or more characteristics of that unit such as its combat or movement ability. Such 
cards provide as much information as possible within the physical limitations 
of a card.
Card modifiers provide a way to slightly alter another card. One common modi­
fier is a form of defense that cancels out another player’s attack card. Another com­
mon modifier is a form of offense that increases a player’s unit to improve its 
chances of success. Card modifiers create variety by giving players additional 
choices to consider.
Many cards have unique relationships with one another, which creates additional 
surprises to a game that keeps play unpredictable and challenging. One common 
relationship is to have one card enhance the effects of another card. This creates a 
doubling effect where playing one card may do something (good or bad), but adding 
the modifier makes that card far more powerful.
Finally, many card games include a wildcard that gives players choices for how 
that card can be used. In many games based on 52-card decks, adding a joker creates 
a wildcard that can represent any value the player wishes. Wildcards alter a game by 
giving players the freedom to choose what they want (within limits) rather than wait 
to draw a specific type of card instead.
When creating a card game, consider the main units and their values, any modi­
fiers that can be applied to a card, any special relationships between cards, and the 
use of any wildcards within the game that give players choices.

The main card types are those that can help the player win. Then the other card 
types provide ways to increase or decrease chances of winning through modifiers, 
relationships, or wildcards.
Thought Exercise
Pick a card game based on a regular 52-card deck and identify how the different 
values determine how to win the game. Are there any ways to modify the cards? Is 
there any special relationship between specific cards? Are there any choices a player 
can make due to a wildcard?
Summary
Card games can often be played on any flat surface and engage two or more players. 
Cards are designed to be held in groups so information printed on the card should 
be readily visible. Every card game needs cards that allow players to win the game, 
and additional cards to attack other players or defend against other players.
Summary

182
When playing a card game, the variety of different cards appearing keeps the 
gameplay interesting. The number of cards and decks can make each game unpre­
dictable, which makes every game challenging.
Essentially, card games are puzzle and strategy games that force players to solve 
challenges and outwit opponents. The interaction between cards creates unique 
puzzles to solve and the behavior of other players helps dictate long-term strategies 
needed to defeat them. Combine puzzles with strategy and that’s the foundation for 
nearly every card game in the world.

Understanding Game Engines
There are many ways to create a digital prototype for a video game. To prototype the 
user interface, use a presentation program (such as PowerPoint) where each slide 
represents a single screen and their order defines how one screen transitions to 
another. However, to prototype gameplay elements for a video game, you’ll need to 
create a digital prototype using a game engine.
A game engine takes care of the common aspects of a video game (such as 
detecting collisions, dealing with gravity, and detecting input from a keyboard, 
mouse, touch screen, or game controller). Without a game engine, designers would 
have to code everything themselves. Such a process would be time-consuming and 
error-prone, which is why most video game developers rely on tested and proven 
game engines instead.
A typical game engine offers the following video game elements:
•	 Graphics
•	 Sound
•	 Physics
•	 User interface
•	 Input controls (keyboard, mouse, game controller, touch screen, touchpad)
•	 Artificial intelligence for controlling enemies
•	 Networking (for multiplayer play over the Internet)
Game engines provide the technical details of making a game work so designers can 
focus on the creative details for making their specific game. A game engine essen­
tially provides a simple, generic video game to customize so designers don’t have to 
create every video game element from scratch.

How to Use a Game Engine
A game engine provides the basic foundation for creating a video game. Then it’s 
up to the game designers to add unique assets such as player characters, instructions 
that define how the game works, game levels that define the location of enemies, 
allies, and resources, and the location of the goal that players are striving to reach.
Every game engine tends to specialize in certain features. As a result, there is no 
single “best” game engine to use. Instead, any choice involves finding the best game 
engine for your particular needs. Some game engines specialize in offering specific 
features for creating one type of game but lack other features for creating other 
types of games. A game engine might specialize in creating 2D games, but com­
pletely lack features for making 3D games. The advantage of such a game engine is 
that all of its features will help you make 2D games, but if you ever want to make a 
3D game, you’ll need to learn another game engine.
Other game engines offer multiple features, but specialize in one or two specific 
features. Such a game engine might offer the ability to create both 2D and 3D 
games, but really excel at creating 2D games over 3D games. The advantage is that 
if you later want to create a 3D game, you don’t need to learn a new game engine. 
The disadvantage is that the game engine might offer features you don’t need and 
that its features for creating a 3D game might not be as good as other game engines 
that make it much easier to create 3D games.
Some of the different game engine capabilities include:
•	 2D games
•	 3D games
•	 Platform support
•	 Programming language options
•	 Specialized game creation
Different Game Types
2D games restrict movement to horizontal and/or vertical scrolling, or no scrolling 
at all. Players may view the game from the side, top, or isometric (2.5D) perspective 
that simulates 3D geometry. The key is that players cannot move along the Z-axis 
(in and out from the screen surface).
A side perspective scrolls the background to follow the player. Side scrollers 
emphasize left and right horizontal movement, such as Mario Brothers. Platformer 
games emphasize up and down vertical movement such as Donkey Kong where 
players gradually ascend or descend between different platforms. The direction 
players must move to reach a goal determines whether the game is predominantly a 
side scroller (the goal must be reached by moving to the left or right) or a platformer 
(the goal must be reached by moving up or down).
19  Understanding Game Engines

185
Both a top-down and isometric (2.5D) perspective provides an overhead view of 
the game. Where side perspective games let you see what’s to the front, back, top, 
and below, top-down perspective games let you see what’s to the front, back, left, 
and right.
3D games specifically allow players to move forward and back along with side 
to side or up and down. First-person shooter games are one type of popular 3D game 
where players see through the eyes of the character that they’re controlling.
Another type of perspective is an over the shoulder view where players can see 
the back of their character. This type of perspective allows players to see around the 
player character so they can spot enemies and obstacles around them easier.
If you want to create different types of 2D and 3D games, you’ll want a game 
engine that can create all these different game types. Otherwise you may spend time 
learning a game engine only to find out later it won’t let you create a certain type of 
game later.
Thought Exercise
Two popular, general purpose game engines that are nearly equal in features are 
Unity (unity.com) and Unreal (unrealengine.com). Visit both websites and compare 
their features. Based on these features, which game engine do you think would be 
best for your particular game idea and why?
Two less popular but rival game engines are Godot (godotengine.org) and 
GameMaker Studio (gamemaker.io). Godot is free and open source but GameMaker 
Studio is proprietary and costs money to use. By studying different game engines, 
you can get a better idea which features might be most important for your game idea.
Platform Support
Whether you create a 2D or 3D game, the more platforms the game runs on, the 
greater the potential audience. Some common gaming platforms include:
•	 Personal computers
•	 Game consoles (including handheld consoles)
•	 Mobile devices (smartphones and tablets)
•	 Web (run inside any browser)
Personal computers run on operating systems that include Windows, macOS, and 
Linux where Windows is the most popular PC gaming operating system. While it’s 
still possible to sell games on discs for people to install on their computers, it’s far 
more cost efficient to distribute games over the Internet through a gaming platform 
such as Steam, Epic Games Store, Itch.io, Apple Arcade, or GOG.com.
Platform Support

186
Although personal computers remain popular gaming platforms, there’s an 
equally large market for games that run on game consoles such as Sony’s PlayStation, 
Microsoft’s Xbox, and Nintendo’s Switch. In different parts of the world, game 
consoles are more popular than personal computers but in other parts of the world, 
personal computers or smart phones are used for gaming more often than game 
consoles. The regional market you want to target can determine what game engines 
you might want to use (or avoid).
Another huge gaming market are mobile computers such as smartphones and 
tablets that run either iOS or Android. While games for personal computers and 
gaming consoles are meant to be played for long periods of time (such as hours), 
games designed for mobile devices can be played in minutes. This means mobile 
games are often shorter, easier to learn, and less complicated to focus on single or 
dual players who are physically together.
A fourth gaming platform is the Web where games can run in any browser. Such 
Web games are popular with people who do not have the space or computing power 
to run the latest video games. As a result, Web-based games are often simple and 
easy to learn, much like games designed for mobile devices.
Each gaming platform appeals to different people so games need to be designed 
for each audience and platform. For example, a game designed for mobile devices 
will likely be short and easy to learn while focusing on touch screen controls. Such 
a game may not appeal to game console users who want more involved games that 
can be controlled through game controllers.
So the game engine you choose depends partly on which platforms that game 
engine supports. If a game engine does not support a platform you want your game 
to run on, you’ll need to use a different game engine.
Thought Exercise
Which gaming platform would you want to reach with your game idea? Based on 
the gaming platform most important to you, research different game engines and 
identify the one you think would be best for your particular game.
Programming Language Options
To use a game engine, you need to load assets such as graphics and audio. To make 
your game actually work, you’ll need to write code. However, game engines tend to 
offer one or more different programming languages. The programming language 
you prefer might define which game engines to consider.
19  Understanding Game Engines

187
Some popular programming languages used in game engines include:
•	 C++ (used in Unreal, CryEngine, and O3DE)
•	 C# (used in Unity, Stride, and Godot)
•	 Lua (used in Defold, Solar2D, and O3DE)
•	 Proprietary languages (used in GameMaker Studio and Godot)
Many game engines support only one programming language but others support 
multiple programming languages, letting you choose the language you like for that 
particular game engine. Since writing code may be too difficult for many people, 
many game engines also offer a visual scripting option.
With visual scripting, you create a program visually using nodes (boxes) and 
links (connections between the nodes). Visual scripting provides a way for non-­
programmers to control a game without learning programming or waiting for a pro­
grammer to write a program for them.
If a game engine offers a traditional programming language and a visual script­
ing option, it’s possible to create a game using both, or just one or the other. Although 
visual scripting can be easy for non-programmers to use, they tend to get clumsy 
when writing large programs.
Unfortunately, visual scripts tend to run much slower than traditional program­
ming language code. Even worse, visual scripting takes up larger amounts of space 
just to make the simplest program. What might take a handful of lines of text in a 
traditional language like C++ could take up half a screen with a visual scripting 
language.
The end result is that creating short, simple programs is easy with visual script­
ing languages, but creating large, complex programs creates a tangle of lines and 
boxes that become increasingly hard to understand and modify. A 100-line program 
in a traditional language like C++ takes up a little more space than a 50-line pro­
gram. However, doubling the complexity of a visual scripting program can more 
than double the size of the visual script.
So the main purpose of visual scripting is to make it easy to get part of a video 
game working, especially for non-programmers. Then it’s common to either keep 
the visual script program small or rewrite that visual script in a traditional program­
ming language later.
Since traditional programming languages like C++, C#, and even Lua weren’t 
specifically designed for games, some game engines offer proprietary languages 
designed specifically to make writing video games easy.
Such proprietary languages are often based on existing programming languages, 
such as Python, to make learning them easier. Since game engines often do not sup­
port many programming languages, you need to choose the programming language 
you’re most familiar with first and then find a game engine that uses your favorite 
programming language.
If you don’t mind learning a proprietary language designed specifically for writ­
ing games, consider a game engine that offers a proprietary language.
Programming Language Options

188
Thought Exercise
Examine O3DE (www.o3de.org) and GameMaker Studio (gamemaker.io), which 
both offer proprietary languages along with visual scripting. Based on what you 
learn about the proprietary languages used in O3DE and GameMaker Studio, would 
you want to use either game engine, knowing you’ll need to learn a proprietary 
language? Why or why not?
Using Specialty Game Engines
Most game engines are designed for creating all types of video games. The advan­
tage is that once you learn how to use that one game engine, you can apply your 
knowledge of that game engine to create any other types of games you wish. 
However the disadvantage is that general purpose game engines are not optimized 
for any particular type of game. That means the game engine may be unnecessarily 
complicated and overwhelm you with features you don’t need.
As an alternative to general purpose game engines, many game designers rely on 
specialty game engines designed to create one specific type of game or offer a 
unique feature not easily found in rival game engines. By using a specialty game 
engine, you can create a particular type of game much easier and faster because it’s 
focused on creating the exact type of game you want. The disadvantage is that if you 
want to create a different type of game, you’ll need to learn and use a completely 
different game engine.
19.1
Unlike the more popular general purpose game engines (Unity and Unreal), spe­
cialty game engines lack a large user base, which means fewer resources for getting 
help in using the game engine. Specialty game engines may force you to learn a 
particular programming language that you may not want to use and may not be able 
to create games for all types of platforms such as mobile and consoles.
Ultimately, you have to decide whether it’s worth learning a specialty game 
engine and living with that specialty game engine’s limitations, or using a general 
purpose game engine and creating much of the game yourself that a specialty game 
engine could do for you instead.
Thought Exercise
Examine the specialty game engines that interest you and study its features. What 
features do you like? What possible limitations can you identify? For your game 
idea, would a specialty game engine be better than a general purpose game engine?

Choosing a Game Engine
Game engines can take care of the technical details of a video game so you can 
focus on the unique features that make your game work. Since there are so many 
different game engines available, choosing one can be overwhelming. It’s entirely 
possible that one game engine will make creating a game easy while a different 
game engine would make creating that same game much harder because of what 
features each game engine offers and your own personal preferences.
To help you decide which game engine might be right for you, consider these 
criteria:
•	 Popularity
•	 Ease of use
•	 Cost
Choosing a Game Engine

190
•	 Programming language options
•	 Features
•	 Support
The two most popular game engines (at the time of this writing) are Unity and 
Unreal. Learning a popular game engine means your skills can be marketable since 
more companies will need people familiar with Unity or Unreal than with less popu­
lar game engines. From a job perspective, Unity or Unreal game engine experience 
is far more useful than learning other game engines.
Popular game engines also offer plenty of support from its millions of users. That 
means more books, training classes, and online resources are available for Unity 
and Unreal than for other game engines. In case you’re not a graphic artist or can’t 
hire one, both Unity and Unreal offer a large asset store where other people sell or 
give away graphic and audio assets that you can use in your own games. Other game 
engines rarely offer the same amount of professional quality assets.
Also consider ease of use. Unity is considered easier to learn and use than Unreal. 
Because of that, more independent game developers tend to start with Unity and 
either stay with Unity or switch to another game engine later. What one person 
might find easier to use, another person might find harder to use so ease of use 
depends entirely on your perspective.
Another factor to consider is cost. Many game engines are open source so they’re 
free to use. Any games you create with them remain 100% under your control. In 
comparison, some game engines cost money just for the right to use it. Any games 
you create using that game engine remains 100% under your control.
Other game engines (such as Unity and Unreal) are free to use but once your 
game starts earning revenue above a fixed amount, you must pay a certain percent­
age of your profits to the game engine publisher. However, if your game never earns 
money past a fixed threshold, you’re never obligated to pay any royalties at all.
So the three most common costs for game engines are:
•	 Free
•	 Upfront cost, but no additional costs afterwards
•	 Free, but must pay royalties if your game earns a certain amount
Even though there are plenty of free, open source game engines on the market, 
many game designers prefer Unity or Unreal because both game engines are backed 
by a major corporation. That means the company will continue improving the game 
engine on a regular schedule.
While open source game engines let you access and modify the source code, 
doing this yourself will take time from actually creating your game. Open source 
game engines have varying levels of support from a handful of volunteers to the 
backing of major corporations. That means open source game engines have varying 
levels of development where regular updates and bug fixes may occur sporadically. 
If you need the dependability of a reliable game engine with regular updates, your 
choice of potential game engines narrows considerably.
19  Understanding Game Engines

191
Every game engine has its strengths and weaknesses. Ultimately a game engine 
is a tool so it’s important to choose the right tool for your particular game idea. The 
worst game engine in the hands of a skilled game designer will create better results 
than the best game engine in the hands of a novice game designer.
The more game engines you evaluate, the better you’ll be able to identify the 
features you need so you can find the game engine that’s best for you.
Thought Exercise
Make a list of the top three criteria that’s most important to you (such as price, pro­
gramming language used, or support). Evaluate different game engines (https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_game_engines) and identify at least three game 
engines that match your criteria. Which game engine would you choose and why? 
Why would you not choose another game engine?
Summary
Game engines provide a foundation for creating a game so you can focus on your 
game details rather than on the common properties of every video game such as 
displaying graphics on the screen or detecting user input from a touch screen or 
keyboard. Because there are so many game engines available, every game engine 
offers strengths and weaknesses.
Game engines must be programmed, which means learning the programming 
language that the game engine uses. This can be a popular language such as C++ or 
C#, or a less popular or proprietary language. For non-programmers, many game 
engines offer a visual scripting option as well.
Many game engines are free and open source, but the cost of using a commercial 
game engine might be worth it for the support, skill marketability, third-party assets, 
and regular updates. When choosing a game engine, consider the long-term benefits 
of learning that particular game engine and its programming language.
Game engines are a crucial tool for creating video games so make sure you learn 
at least one game engine. The best game engine is the one that helps you create a 
finished game.

Playing Field Prototypes
Every game must be played on a playing field. For card games, that playing field can 
be any flat surface. For board games and sports, the playing field is a defined area 
that restricts where playing pieces can move and the boundaries where they must 
stay within. For video games, the playing field appears within the computer, but can 
be as simple as a single screen or as expansive as an entire open world that players 
can endlessly explore.
Since every game needs a playing surface, one of the first items to prototype is 
the playing field. Some questions a playing field prototype can answer right 
away are:
•	 What are the boundaries of the playing field?
•	 Where can players move in the playing field?
•	 What obstacles block or restrict the player’s movement?
•	 What items help the player?
•	 What are players trying to do in the playing field?
Defining Playing Field Boundaries
How big is the playing field? Even in the most expansive open world video game 
that allows players to explore entire galaxies, players still need a specific place to do 
something within the game. Board games typically define a boundary based on the 
size of a folding board that can fit within a game box. Sports define a boundary 
based on an arbitrary size.
Boundaries aren’t just limited to the edges. In many board games, boundaries 
define where players can move. Three common ways board games restrict move­
ment include:

Video games may offer similar endless landscapes to explore, but may divide the 
entire game world into specific areas or levels. Each level represents mastery over a 
specific skill and provides a way for players to measure their progress towards win­
ning the game.
A playing field prototype can help you define the best size for a playing field. 
Small playing fields force players and enemies together, which can encourage com­
bat as often as possible. Larger playing fields allow players to avoid enemies if they 
wish, allowing less combat and more options such as stealth to sneak by enemies. 
 
20  Playing Field Prototypes

195
 
Defining Playing Field Boundaries

196
 
Video games often divide the entire game world into separate levels where each 
level can vary in size.
In battle royale games, the playing field starts out large and gradually shrinks 
over time to force players together, thereby increasing the chance that they’ll have 
to fight each other. The size and shape of the playing field greatly influences game­
play. By testing out different sizes and shapes for a game’s playing field, you can 
identify the optimum shape for your game design.
Thought Exercise
Pick a board game. How would gameplay be affected if the board were enlarged to 
five times its current size? How would gameplay be affected if the board size was 
cut in half? How does the board game ensure that all players have an equal chance 
of winning?
20  Playing Field Prototypes

197
Pick a video game. How does the video game display the entire playing field? 
How does the video game keep players from going too far away from the main play­
ing area?
Defining Movement Within the Playing Field
The playing field prototype must test where players can move within the game. A 
two-dimensional game restricts players to moving horizontally (x-axis) and verti­
cally (y-axis), while a three-dimensional game allows players to also move along 
the z-axis.
The size of the playing field limits where the player can move, but within the 
playing field there may be additional restrictions. In baseball, the batting team’s 
players can only run along the base paths while the fielding team’s players can 
freely run anywhere they wish. In hockey, players on both teams may move freely 
anywhere they wish, but the puck must cross the blue line before any attacking play­
ers do or else they are called offsides.
In sports and many board games, the movement restrictions within the playing 
field are uniform, meaning that the only differences between one area and another 
may be its location closer or further away from a particular area. However, one area 
of the playing field does not contain obstacles that another area does not.
In other board games and many video games, internal obstacles are not distrib­
uted uniformly. One part of the playing field may contain a river and another part 
may contain a forest. Because the internal obstacles differ so drastically, there’s the 
risk that the playing field itself will not offer players a fair chance of success depend­
ing on the location where they start.
The playing field defines the outer boundaries of the game along with the inner 
restrictions of movement within the game. In board and video games, movement is 
often confined to regularly spaces (such as squares or hexagons) where playing 
pieces may move. In some video games, this movement grid appears on top of any 
graphic terrain, but in other video games, this movement grid may exist but is invis­
ible to the player.
Square grids, such as those found on a chess board, let players move pieces hori­
zontally, vertically, and diagonally. The problem with diagonal movement on square 
grids is moving diagonally covers a greater length than moving horizontally or ver­
tically. Thus if a playing piece can only move three squares, diagonal movement lets 
a piece move further than if it moved horizontally or vertically.
20.4
Defining Movement Within the Playing Field

198
Most importantly, a playing field prototype can make sure that players can reach 
all areas of the playing field. Otherwise it’s possible to design a playing field that 
players can never access, making it pointless to create that part of the playing field 
in the first place.
In some cases, there might be a good reason for why a player should not access 
certain parts of a playing field. In many historical simulations, the playing field 
represents a map of an actual area that might include part of the ocean or lakes. Such 
areas might be inaccessible to playing pieces to maintain historical accuracy, but 
any such inaccessible areas should take up as little space in the playing field as pos­
sible. Otherwise large areas of the playing field will be unusable to the player.
Essentially, a playing field prototype should test that players can move where the 
designer expects them to move. That means making sure there are no areas where 
the player cannot reach.
Just as game designers must balance the opposing forces to ensure no player has 
an overwhelming advantage over another, so must playing field prototypes balance 
the playing field so no position is more important than any other area. Otherwise 
players will simply crowd one particular area of the playing field and ignore the rest.
In sports and simple video games, the playing field represents a blank area. 
However in many video games, the playing field does not appear as a flat, blank 
area. Instead, the playing field may be filled with trees, buildings, bridges, or bushes.
In a wargame simulation, the terrain might contain desert, swamps, forests, 
mountains, and open fields. Each of these different terrain can affect movement. 
 
20  Playing Field Prototypes

199
Thus the playing field prototype must test to ensure all areas of the playing field are 
useful in some way. If part of a playing field is never useful for any reason, players 
will simply abandon that area over time.
In a video game, a playing field may contain walls, rivers, lava, open pits, and 
other obstacles that either completely block movement or slow movement down. 
Video game playing fields may be an open world where players can freely roam, or 
mazes that direct players down certain pathways.
Thought Exercise
What movement limitations define where playing pieces can be placed on the play­
ing field? How does the playing field ensure that players have an equal chance of 
winning no matter what their initial starting location might be?
How do obstacles in the playing field affect where a player can move? How do 
obstacles in the playing field hinder the player’s movement options?
Defining a Goal in the Playing Field
The most important part about a playing field is identifying a goal for players to 
move towards. By knowing what the goal is, a playing field prototype can test 
whether players can reach this goal without it being too easy or too hard.
Goals must be clear. If a goal is not obvious, then players won’t have any idea 
what they’re supposed to do. If players are confused, they won’t have fun.
In many cases, goals are clearly marked so players can see them from a distance. 
That way even from the start, players know which direction they should go, even if 
they don’t know exactly how they’ll get there. Many video games make goals visi­
ble by making them appear as mountains or towers.
This design of goals as visible landmarks stems from the design of theme parks 
that use tall, distinct structures to help orient people. In Disneyland, Sleeping 
Beauty’s castle appears in the center of the park so people in any location can easily 
see it from any distance. Once people can see a landmark, they can gradually make 
their way towards it.
That’s the same principle behind designing video games. The goal should be vis­
ible so players know which direction they should go. Prominent landmarks work in 
video games set in the outdoors, but such prominent landmarks don’t work in indoor 
settings such as caves or dungeons. In that case, the design of the setting should 
gradually funnel players in the direction they need to go.
In a dungeon, there might be multiple directions players could move, but no mat­
ter which direction players choose, it will gradually lead them towards the goal such 
as an exit. Such a design limits players to either moving closer towards the goal or 
Defining a Goal in the Playing Field

200
backwards away from the goal. This makes it easy for players to know which direc­
tion they’re going at all times.
Sometimes, video games might deliberately want to disorient players, such as in 
horror games. By trapping players in a twisting maze-like setting, the game world 
works against the player finding an exit. The goal of such settings is to keep players 
from escaping.
Any playing field should maximize its space. So the playing field prototype can 
identify which parts of the playing field players tend to use most. That way design­
ers can change the output so players spend a nearly equal amount of time using all 
parts of the playing field.
Paths to the goal may be linear or branching. A linear path provides the greatest 
control over the player’s experience (from a designer’s perspective), but limits the 
player’s freedom to choose. With a linear path, designers know exactly the order 
players will encounter obstacles, resources, enemies, and non-player characters.
A branching path provides multiple ways to reach a goal. These branching paths 
can be mutually exclusive, meaning if players choose one path, they may never 
explore any of the alternative paths. Other times, branching paths may allow players 
to go back and choose a different path to explore more of the map or in case they get 
stuck on one path and want to try a different one instead.
Paths to the goal must be clear and obvious, or else players won’t know what to 
do and the game will feel confusing and pointless. A single path allows the game 
designer to control the player’s experience, which is often used in games heavily 
dependent on stories. Multiple paths provide greater freedom for the player but less 
control of the order that players encounter obstacles. This creates a less defined 
story experience. In some open world games, players choose their own goals.
In Minecraft, players can do what they want and go anywhere they want. 
However, even in such open worlds, the playing field must provide clues for what 
players might do, such as digging for resources, building a structure, hunting ani­
mals, or exploring a specific area of the map.
Instead of creating an open world where players can do anything they want, or a 
single path that restricts player’s choices, video games might offer multiple paths to 
a single goal, which gives players the option of choosing the path they like best. 
Multiple paths also provide players alternatives in case obstacles along one path 
prove too difficult to overcome. Yet just as with a single path, a playing field proto­
type must ensure that there are no obstacles so difficult that players cannot get 
past them.
Ideally, navigation through a playing area should also be fun and interesting. 
Players should be able to practice different skills and learn something new such as 
another skill or gain information about the game world that will be useful later.
Complex video games often divide the playing field into separate areas or levels. 
That means each level can focus on teaching players something different. One level 
might emphasize climbing and jumping while another level might emphasize swim­
ming and sailing a boat.
Ultimately, a playing field prototypes need to ensure that players can find a goal 
and reach it.
20  Playing Field Prototypes

201
Thought Exercise
Pick a board game. Just by looking at the board, is the player’s goal clear? Even if 
the player’s goal is not clear, how does the board show how the player can reach 
the goal?
Pick an open world video game. Even if there is no single goal to pursue, does 
the playing field provide hints at some of the different goals players can pursue?
Pick a video game that is not an open world game. How does the game show 
players what goal they should pursue?
Does the game offer a single path to a goal or multiple paths? How can players 
find the paths to the goal?
How does each playing field or level of a game surprise the player by forcing 
them to learn something new?
Defining Obstacles and Resources in the Playing Field
Not only must a playing field prototype define a goal for players to reach, but it must 
also place obstacles and resources in the player’s way. Obstacles block the player’s 
progress by stopping forward movement and/or damaging the player so they can’t 
keep moving. In a dungeon game, a troll might block the way. To get past the troll, 
players must fight the troll, which gives the troll a chance to wound or kill the player.
Resources help the player reach the goal. Common resources might be food, 
health boosters, ammunition, weapons, treasures, or even non-player characters 
who can be enticed to join forces with the player.
Games often reward players with resources each time they defeat an enemy. 
Another option is to sprinkle a playing field with resources that players can simply 
find. Yet another option is to hide resources and force players to search for them.
In a fast-paced first-person shooter, resources typically appear on the ground so 
players can easily find and use them. In an adventure game, resources may be hid­
den, forcing players to solve puzzles to find them. The type of game experience a 
playing field creates will determine how players easily players can find resources. 
The combination of obstacles and resources provides different ways to affect the 
player’s progression towards a goal.
Obstacles can be static such as walls, pits, or rivers that never change, or they can 
be dynamic and represent items that move around such as sliding platforms and 
spinning fans to avoid, or non-player characters such monsters or bandits. After 
players kill a monster, is the monster gone for good or will it reappear if players visit 
the same area at a later time?
The playing field prototype needs to test where to place obstacles and where to 
place resources. Too many obstacles will make the game too hard. Too many 
resources will make the game too easy.
Defining Obstacles and Resources in the Playing Field

202
The strength of each obstacle and resource can also affect the game. Obstacles 
may be numerous, but if they’re too easy to overcome, the game will feel too repeti­
tive. If obstacles are sparse but too hard to overcome, the game will feel frustrating. 
Likewise, if resources are too powerful, players won’t feel challenged. If resources 
are too weak, the game will also feel frustrating.
The number and quality of obstacles and resources needs to be adjusted based on 
the purpose of the game. An adventure game promises exciting gameplay so obsta­
cles tend to be weaker and resources tend to be more plentiful. On the other hand, 
horror games put players in a weak position so obstacles tend to be stronger and 
resources tend to be limited to further create a sense of dread and hopelessness. 
Whatever emotional experience the game plans to create, that’s the experience a 
playing field prototype needs to test.
So a playing field prototype must test:
•	 Is there a clear goal for players to pursue?
•	 What are the paths to this goal?
•	 What are the obstacles blocking the player’s path to the goal?
•	 What are the resources helping the player reach the goal?
Thought Exercise
In any video games, what obstacles block the player’s progress? If a player cannot 
get past a particular obstacle, what alternatives can the player choose, if any? What 
resources can players find that can help them?
Summary
The purpose of a playing field prototype is to:
•	 Find the right size for the playing field
•	 Test any movement limitations within the playing field
•	 Test the placement and quantity of obstacles and resources within the play­
ing field
•	 Make sure the goal is clear and achievable
In board games and simple video games, a playing field prototype might consist of 
a single large sheet of paper. For a complex video game, there might be multiple 
playing fields, or levels. Each level should be prototyped to determine how well it 
works. Then all levels should be combined to make sure they work together.
Initially, video game levels can be tested using paper prototypes. Then they can 
be tested using digital prototypes that provide a closer approximation of how the 
actual video game will work.
20  Playing Field Prototypes

203
A game’s playing field should be fun to navigate, filled with obstacles that force 
players to practice new skills, and designed so players know what they can do at all 
times to reach a specific goal. Since players will spend all of their time interacting 
with the playing field, it’s crucial to design the playing field so it matches the design 
goals of your game.

Chapter 21
Level Design Prototypes
Board games consist of a single playing field. On the other hand, video games often 
consist of multiple playing fields known as levels. Levels break up a large video 
game into smaller, interconnected parts that represent increasingly difficult chal­
lenges for players to overcome.
Since each level acts as a separate mini-game within the overall game, it’s best to 
prototype each level separately. Like a playing field prototype, a level prototype 
needs to define the size, boundaries, obstacles, and resources. However, level proto­
types must also focus on additional details:
•	 Exploration of the game world
•	 Teaching players specific skills
•	 Advancing the story
Think of each level like an escape room where players enter and cannot leave until 
they solve and overcome multiple problems. Like an escape room, levels must be 
fun and interesting to examine until players figure out a way to get out.
Exploring the Game World
When a video game consists of multiple levels, every level must be different and 
surprise the player in some way. The simplest way to surprise a player is to provide 
another part of the game world to explore, and the best way to surprise players is to 
rely on contrast in several ways:
•	 Place
•	 Challenges and obstacles
•	 Time

•	 Climate
•	 Enemies
•	 Difficulty
Every level occurs at a specific location. The more memorable the location, the 
more interesting it will be to explore. If one level involves a player exploring a cav­
ern, that means the player must learn to navigate through tight spaces. Now for 
contrast, the next level should be the opposite and provide a far more open space 
where players can roam around an open field. This sudden change from a confined 
area to an open area creates greater variety while also forcing players to adapt to an 
entirely different part of the same gaming world.
Contrast can not only come from the environment, but also from the types of 
challenges the level contains. One level might force players to battle monsters in 
close combat using swords or clubs. Then the next level can contrast this by forcing 
players to battle different monsters in ranged combat using arrows or spears. One 
level might force players to avoid fire but the next level might force players to avoid 
flying objects being thrown from above.
Contrast can also come from time and climate. One level might take place in the 
day time of bright skies while the next level might take place at night or in the dim 
corridors of a castle. One level might take place in a sandy desert while another level 
might take place among snow drifts in the mountains.
The number and type of enemies should also change from one level to another. 
The simplest change is to increase the number of enemies. In the arcade game 
Asteroids, players control a spaceship while asteroids fly around it. The player must 
blow apart the asteroids while avoiding an asteroid hitting the spaceship.
The first level displayed a handful of asteroids to teach players the basic move­
ment and shooting mechanics of the game. However, each succeeding level increased 
the number of asteroids flying around the player’s spaceship.
Another change can be increasing the speed or capabilities of the enemies. In 
Asteroids, not only did each level display more asteroids, but they also started mov­
ing faster. Yet another change might be including new enemies along with enemies 
from the previous level, or displaying the same enemies as a previous level but with 
new capabilities. In Asteroids, a flying saucer pops up periodically and shoots at the 
player, forcing the player to dodge the flying saucer shots and the asteroids at the 
same time.
Finally, levels must gradually increase the difficulty whether through more ene­
mies, faster enemies, more powerful enemies, or greater obstacles. The difficulty 
must be harder, but not dramatically so to ensure that players can still complete it 
with their current abilities.
The greater the contrast, the more variety in the game. The more variety in the 
game, the less likely players will get bored. Remember, the purpose of every level 
is to grab and hold the player’s attention so they’ll keep playing the game. Players 
must see and experience something different from each level to keep the game inter­
esting at all times.
21  Level Design Prototypes

207
Thought Exercise
Pick a video game that contains multiple levels. How do the levels differ between 
the first level and the second? How do the levels differ between the first level and the 
last level?
Can you think of a game where levels do not differ in any noticeable way? Can 
you think of a game where later levels are easier than earlier levels with fewer 
obstacles and weaker enemies to defeat?
Teaching New Skills
The only way players can win in a video game is to gradually develop skills. In the 
beginning, players know little about the gaming world and have little idea how to 
play the game, let alone how to win and complete the game. That’s why the first 
level of nearly every video game acts as a tutorial to teach players the basic moves 
they can make and give them confidence that they can play and master the game. 
Some typical lessons players learn in each level includes:
•	 Different ways to move
•	 Different ways to fight
•	 Different types of obstacles and enemies to overcome
In most games, the first level teaches players the basics of controlling their character 
whether it’s a vehicle (car, airplane, spaceship) or a person. This basic level chal­
lenges players to move and dodge fixed and moving obstacles without feeling over­
whelmed. Until players can master this first level, the game deliberately holds them 
back from succeeding levels because if they can’t control their vehicle or character, 
they’ll have no chance of succeeding in any other levels either.
21.1
Besides learning to move, most video games need to teach players how to fight. 
In Angry Birds, the first level teaches players the basics of aiming a slingshot, load­
ing different birds into the slingshot, changing the velocity by pulling back on the 
slingshot, and seeing how to attack enemy structures. Once players master this ini­
tial level, each succeeding level gets progressively harder with stronger structures, 
but also different types of birds players can shoot. This combination off additional 
challenges and different types of bird ammunition gradually teaches players new 
ways to play and win the game while overcoming increasingly difficult obstacles.
After players learn the basics to moving and fighting, levels can further challenge 
them by forcing them to combine existing skills or use existing skills in novel com­
binations. In many fighting games, players learn the basics of punching, kicking, 
ducking, jumping, and moving back and forth. The next step involves combining 
certain moves to create unique, powerful combinations that are greater than the 
individual parts.
Teaching New Skills

208
 
For example, a punch followed by a kick might cause a fixed amount of damage 
to an enemy, but if players learn to punch, then jump while moving forward, and 
then kick, this combination might create greater damage even though it still involves 
a punch and a kick. By forcing players to use their existing skills in novel combina­
tions, levels can teach players how to use existing skills to win the game.
Every game level acts as a new lesson for the player to teach a new or different 
way to move, fight, or understand different ways to use existing skills in unique 
combinations. Ideally, each new level should teach multiple lessons but they should 
all be focused on a similar theme.
For example, if a level teaches players how to climb the side of a cliff, then the 
level should also teach players how to fight enemies above and below while also 
explaining more about the game world itself. Perhaps the cliffs will lead the player 
to a castle on top of a mountain or the cliffs might just lead to a flat area with forests. 
Learning something new, or learning new ways to use existing skills, is the key to 
making every level different from earlier levels.
Thought Exercise
Pick a video game and identify the lessons the first level teachers players. Pick a 
level in the middle and identify how the lessons learned are different from the first 
level. Pick the last level and identify the skills players need to complete the game. 
Where did players learn these necessary skills before the final level?
21  Level Design Prototypes

209
Telling a Story Through Levels
Many games tell a story. In linear stories, the player experiences the story much like 
a movie or a book except they get to make choices within the story. In non-linear 
stories, player actions help create their own stories that fit within the larger story 
world of the game.
For example, Horizon Zero Dawn takes place in a world that’s been overrun by 
machines. Within that basic story setting, players create their own stories based on 
the choices and actions they make. However, every new area gives players more 
information about the game world background as they encounter new enemies and 
discover resources to help them better survive.
So whether a game is linear or non-linear, levels provide more information about 
the overall game story. Therefore each level must reveal more information about the 
story through the environment of that level along with any items the player may find 
or non-player characters the player may meet who can reveal more information.
When players go through levels in a specific order, information about the larger 
game story can be revealed in a linear fashion, much like a movie or novel. When 
players can choose which levels to explore in any order, the story information from 
each level cannot depend on information revealed in another level. Thus story infor­
mation can play a lesser role in shaping the player’s experience in the level.
Every level adds information to the overall game story, but every level should 
also tell a story of its own. This level story must define the player’s goal within that 
level. In Donkey Kong, each level story was simple. A gorilla has captured a prin­
cess and it’s up to the player to rescue her.
In Fallout 3, the overall story is about the player finding what their father plans 
to do with a secret project, but each level has specific goals for the player to achieve 
as well. The goal of an early level is simply for the player to find a way out of an 
underground vault to go searching for their father in the open wilderness. The goal 
of another level is to rescue their father from a scientist. Each level goal supports the 
larger goal of the overall story.
When designing levels, start by identifying the game’s overall story setting. Then 
make sure every level tells a different part of the story. Now within each level, define 
the starting point for players and the exit point from that level. It’s entirely possible 
there could be two or more ways players can exit a level such as two different doors 
in a dungeon that lead to the outside.
The structure of each level must tell story that fits within the overall game world 
story setting, but provides a unique challenge to the player from start to finish:
•	 What’s the player’s goal?
•	 What’s stopping the player from reaching the goal?
•	 What skills and resources does the player need to overcome the obstacles and 
enemies in the way?
•	 How can the player achieve that goal?
Telling a Story Through Levels

210
A level goal might consist of a single task such as finding an exit to a dungeon. 
However, sometimes a level goal might consist of several tasks, such as collecting 
multiple treasures scattered throughout the level. The order that players collect the 
treasures doesn’t matter, just as long as they collect all of them. When a level pro­
vides multiple paths to a goal, the player has greater freedom to choose the order 
they pursue each objective.
Not only must the goal be clear, but the path to that goal must be clear as well. A 
game can explicitly define the goal, such as in a cut scene where a non-player char­
acter tells you what you’re supposed to do next.
A second approach are implicit goals. These types of goals occur when players 
figure out their goal based on what they see in that level. A player finding them­
selves in a cavern would quickly figure out they need to find an exit. In the game 
Journey, there’s a mountain that appears in the distance, which clearly signals that 
players should constantly move towards that mountain.
Explicit goals occur when the game tells the player what to do. The goal is clear 
but learning about the goal can feel clumsy. Implicit goals occur when the player 
figures out what they should do. The goal may not be as clear but it can hold more 
meaning since the player themselves feel they have chosen this goal (even though 
the game environment gives players no other choice).
Once players know their goal within a level, the next step is how can they achieve 
that goal? One simple way to create obstacles is to take existing obstacles from a 
previous level and modify it by either changing how it behaves or increasing its 
number or size.
In Super Mario Brothers, players must jump on top of pillars. However, later 
levels display man-eating plants that pop up out the tops of these pillars periodi­
cally, giving pillars a new and added threat.
Obstacles and enemies can block a player’s progress, but another obstacle can be 
a fixed time limit. This forces players to reach a goal by a specific time, so every 
obstacle and enemy that gets in the way may not threaten to stop the player com­
pletely, but can slow the player down enough to keep them from reaching the goal.
If a level does not have a time limit, players can freely explore the entire level at 
a more leisurely pace. This can encourage exploration that a time limit actively 
discourages. Time limits represent another type of obstacle a level can offer to make 
achieving the level goal harder.
When players get past all the obstacles and enemies in a level, they need to know 
they’ve succeeded. Since completing a level represents a major milestone, this event 
must be larger and more emotional than anything that had gone on before in the 
level. The end of a level is where the player must defeat the final level enemy, often 
called the boss level.
This final enemy isn’t just bigger and tougher than anything else in the level. This 
final enemy must also test the player’s skill that they developed throughout the level. 
So if the level emphasized vertical movement and fighting, then players can only 
defeat the boss enemy by demonstrating mastery of vertical movement and fighting.
Think of all obstacles and enemies in a level as different lessons for the player to 
learn, and the final boss as the ultimate test that can demonstrate the player has 
achieved a certain level of skill. Failure to defeat the boss means the player must 
21  Level Design Prototypes

211
practice the level skills some more. Defeating the boss means the player has mas­
tered the level’s lessons and is ready to move to the next level.
When players encounter levels in a specific order, each level can build on the 
skills of the next. When players have greater freedom to choose which levels to 
access at different times, then each level must teach a separate skill that’s still chal­
lenging whether it’s the first level a player explores or the last. By defeating the 
boss, players know without a doubt that they’ve mastered a particular level.
Stories are nothing more than the gradual progression of enemies and obstacles 
that culminate in forcing the player to defeat the biggest enemy of all at the end. The 
emotional state of the player gradually changes over time.
Initially, the player starts each level from an emotional state of uncertainty facing 
the unknown. Then as the player gradually explores the level, they’re forced to learn 
new skills to overcome stronger and different obstacles and enemies. This gradually 
builds up the player’s confidence. Just when players feel they’ve mastered the skills 
necessary to overcome every obstacle and enemy in the level, they must face the 
biggest, strongest, and scariest enemy of all that throws everything in doubt once 
more. Only by defeating this final enemy can players feel a sense of accomplish­
ment that validates all their hard work getting to that final point.
Each level needs to provide its own climactic emotional conclusion. Then the last 
level must be the biggest, toughest, and most emotional battle of all. Levels don’t 
just put obstacles and enemies in the player’s path. Instead, levels use obstacles and 
enemies to create a gradually increasing emotional experience from start to finish.
Thought Exercise
Watch a favorite movie and notice the four main parts of a story:
•	 A hero has a goal but enters an unfamiliar world
•	 The hero can’t reach a goal because obstacles and enemies get in the way
•	 The hero must learn new skills
•	 The hero can finally overcome multiple enemies, including the biggest threat of 
all, by mastering new skills
Pick a video game with multiple levels and examine one or more levels. Do they 
start by putting players in an unfamiliar environment with a goal to pursue? Do 
obstacles and enemies force players to learn new skills? Can the player defeat the 
final enemy using the skills learned and mastered throughout the level?
The Mechanics of Level Design
Once you understand that levels must teach players new skills while creating gradu­
ally increasing emotional experiences, you must also understand the mechanics of 
level design. Levels must keep surprising the player.
The Mechanics of Level Design

212
If a level consists of a dungeon, there must be corridors and rooms for players to 
explore, so players must constantly see something different. Exploring an area once 
should be different from any other area, but returning to that same area could also 
be different to avoid repetition.
Suppose a player is exploring a dungeon and finds a dead body. Returning to that 
same area later might show that body stripped of flesh from rats. This creates greater 
realism within the game world and keeps previously visited areas different in subtle 
ways because something is always changing.
In many games, players can choose a difficulty level such as easy, medium, or 
hard. That means each level must be designed for all three types levels of difficulty. 
An easy difficulty level might omit certain obstacles and enemies while a medium 
difficulty level might add additional obstacles and enemies. A hard difficulty level 
might modify obstacles and enemies to be even harder to overcome. With each dif­
ficulty level, the level must be tested to ensure it offers the right amount of challenge 
for players.
One final consideration for designing a level is speed running. Many players 
enjoy timing how fast they can get through a level so levels can be tested to make 
them fun to navigate. To encourage constant forward movement, levels should not 
contain any dead ends, which will force players to backtrack over previously vis­
ited areas.
Instead, levels should allow players to always move forward without retracing 
their steps. Movement alone should be fun, allowing players to express themselves 
through different types of movement such as running, jumping, climbing, or flying. 
The more ways players can move through a level, the greater their freedom and the 
more likely movement will feel fun.
Spacing between various obstacles can also be important. Too much space 
between obstacles and the level will create dread space where nothing important 
seems to occur. Too little spacing means players may feel overwhelmed. Spacing 
out obstacles and enemies is important to make sure all parts of a level are enjoyable 
to visit.
When designing a level, don’t forget to consider height. Can players jump up or 
down, or climb up or down? Vertical movement allows a level to contain two or 
more floors within a level, allowing more room for exploration. By forcing players 
to consider vertical as well as horizontal movement, levels create greater variety.
Ultimately, level design is more than just placing objects on a map. It’s more like 
designing a theme park ride that tells an engaging story from start to finish that 
gradually builds to a climax at the end.
Thought Exercise
Pick a video game with multiple levels and examine one level to look for the 
following:
21  Level Design Prototypes

213
•	 Surprises
•	 Variable difficulty levels
•	 Movement
As players move through the level, what kind of surprises does the level offer? If 
players backtrack through a previously explored level, does anything change?
If the game lets you choose a difficulty level, how does the game level change 
between difficulty levels such as between Easy and Hard? How does the level make 
movement fun?
Does the level offer vertical movement? If not, how could vertical movement 
change a level? If a level does offer vertical movement, how would that level change 
if vertical movement were taken away?
Summary
Levels are more than just maps within a video game. Instead, levels represent mini-­
stories that must teach players new skills and reveal additional information about 
the gaming world. Levels are meant to be fun to explore and move through.
Right from the start, players should have an idea of what goal they’re supposed 
to pursue. Then every obstacle and enemy blocks the player while gradual lying 
teaching the player how to develop new skills and knowledge. The final test occurs 
at the end when players must overcome the biggest enemy of all, applying all the 
skills they learned throughout the level.
Levels tell emotional stories that start with an unfamiliar setting, then gradually 
introduces the player to new skills and knowledge. Think of levels as a tutorial 
designed to make players feel mastery. Only when they can demonstrate this mas­
tery by defeating the boss can they move on to another level in the game.

Chapter 22
Movement Prototypes
Movement lets players improve their chances of winning. In board games, move­
ment might involve moving one or more playing pieces a fixed or random distance 
determined by a spinner or dice. In a video game, movement involves controlling 
one or more playing pieces around a playing field using a keyboard, mouse, touch 
screen, or game controller.
Movement prototypes need to test one or more of the following:
•	 Movement types
•	 Distances
•	 Movement for other purposes
Testing movement usually requires a playing field prototype of some kind. This 
playing field prototype doesn’t have to be complete, just representative of the play­
ing field that players will move on.
Types of Movement
Two main ways games regulate movement are turn-based vs. real-time and predict­
able vs. random movement. Most board games offer turn-based movement since it’s 
easier to implement. The problem with turn-based movement is that if there are 
multiple players, players have to wait their turn, giving them nothing to do until it’s 
their turn.
One solution, especially for children’s games, is to make each turn short. That 
way nobody has to wait long for their turn. Another solution is to give other players 
a chance to respond to the current player’s turn. In Monopoly, players can make 
deals with other players, forcing those other players to make decisions separate 
from their own turn. In Pandemic, players are cooperating to win the game so every 

216
action one player takes indirectly affects the choices other players will have in their 
own turn. Giving other players something to do during another player’s turn can be 
crucial to keep everyone actively involved.
In video games, movement can be turn-based or real-time. Turn-based video 
games act like digital board games except that the computer takes care of the rules 
and tracking each player’s resources.
With turn-based movement, players must rely on their brains to determine the 
best action to take. With real-time movement, players must rely on their brains and 
their reflexes. Choosing the best move won’t matter if your reflexes can’t support 
your decision. Likewise, having the fastest reflexes won’t matter if you’re constantly 
making the wrong choices.
Thus real-time movement offers a greater challenge to analyze conditions and 
choose the best option within a limited period of time. Turn-based movement can be 
like chess where players can take their time analyzing a situation. Real-time move­
ment is more like speed chess where players must make moves within a limited 
time. Thus time itself becomes an obstacle that players must overcome.
Besides making the best split-second decisions, consider how many ways there 
are to move in a video game. Video games may offer a handful of different ways to 
move (walk, run, jump) but within the game, players can often combine multiple 
movements to create unique results. The more movement options available and the 
more ways they can be combined, the greater the freedom of movement players can 
experience and enjoy.
In turn-based movement, the emphasis lies in analysis. In real-time movement, 
the emphasis lies in analysis while moving or while your opponents are moving. 
Such an ever-changing, dynamic situation makes real-time movement feel more 
realistic and challenging.
A second consideration for movement lies in predictable or random movement. 
To create uncertainty, many board games rely on random movement using a spinner, 
cards, or dice to determine how far a player can move. With random movement, 
players can only react.
Random movement has two meanings. First, it could mean all possible move­
ment values are equally likely to occur. Rolling a single die means the numbers 1 
through 6 all have an equal chance of occurring.
Second, it could mean that some numbers have a greater chance of occurring 
than others, even though all numbers are random. Rolling two dice means the only 
possible numbers are 2 through 12. Yet, 2 and 12 can only occur 1 out of 36 times, 
which means both of those numbers are far less likely to occur than a 7, which can 
be formed by a 4 and a 3, a 5 and a 2, or a 6 and a 1. With so many different ways 
two dice can add up to 7, 7 will occur far more often than either 2 or 12.
In some cases, you may want all possible values to have an equal chance of 
occurring, but in other situations, you may want some values to occur more often 
than others. So even though a random value will occur, some values are more likely 
than others.
22  Movement Prototypes

217
In many strategic board games, players can choose their movement. They may 
move all, some, or none of their units. They also have a choice of moving units up 
to their maximum movement value or anything less including not moving at all.
In addition, terrain can affect movement such as increasing movement on roads 
or slowing movement when crossing swamps or rivers. Such variation of movement 
options gives players greater control over the positioning of their units so they can 
pursue long-term strategies that would be impossible to do if movement were random.
In video games, movement is often completely under the player’s control where 
they can move in different directions, distances, and speeds. However, such move­
ment has limits, forcing players to decide the advantages of moving quickly or 
slowly in any particular direction.
Video games typically give players complete control over their movement 
because part of the challenge lies in mastering movement within the game. Random 
movement may occur in limited situations, such as determining the success of a 
player making a risky move such as leaping for a moving train or jumping from one 
skyscraper rooftop to another.
In such risky moves, video games may introduce an element of chance where the 
player might fail and either die or suffer damage. Such randomization forces players 
to choose between safer movements that may not move them closer to the goal, or 
riskier movements that could move them faster towards the goal at the risk of pos­
sibly failing altogether.
In general, random movement appears more often in board games while predict­
able movement appears more often in video games. Predictable movement gives 
players added control and responsibility for their choices, which encourages players 
to develop their movement skills until they can master their actions.
Thought Exercise
Examine a board game that uses random movement such as a children’s game. How 
would the game change if players could choose their movement? Examine a board 
game that uses predictable movement such as a military simulation game. How 
would the game change if movement were completely random?
In a video game, how many basic ways can players move? How many ways can 
they combine movement options to create unique results? Compare two similar 
video games. Which one offers the best ways to move and why?
Testing Distances of Movement
When moving playing pieces, the first question is balancing between moving too 
much or moving too little. In a board game like Monopoly, players roll two dice to 
determine how far they move. Thus the minimum amount is 2 and the maximum 
amount is 12.
Testing Distances of Movement

218
Rolling one die would limit movement from 1 to 6 spaces, which might feel too 
little as players would take too long to get around the board. Rolling three dice 
would limit movement from 3 to 18, which could be too fast, allowing them to skip 
over too many properties . To test movement in board games, start by finding the 
balance between minimum and maximum movement.
To find this proper balance, examine how movement affects the outcome of the 
game. Suppose a racing game let players throw three dice to determine movement. 
Since getting 18 (a 6 on three separate die) is such a rare occurrence (1 in 216), any 
player that gets an 18 would move so far ahead that the odds of other players catch­
ing up would be much less. That means one lucky throw of the dice could essen­
tially win the game for that lucky player.
By identifying this problem, you can determine that the maximum movement 
should be much less. Then examine the minimum movement. In Monopoly, the 
minimum movement is 2 (two 1 s on two separate die), which has a 1 in 36 chance 
of occurring. One unique feature of this minimum movement of 2 is that it makes it 
impossible for players to land on the next adjacent square.
Although Monopoly players could move at 2 squares a turn, this minimum 
movement distance is rare and unlikely to occur too often. Now suppose Monopoly 
players moved by throwing a single die. That means movement from 1 to 6 squares 
would be equally likely to occur. If a player moved too slowly around the Monopoly 
board, there’s a chance they could run out of money before passing Go. Because of 
this, the minimum movement cannot be too low or occur too often so players can get 
around the board to pass Go and collect money.
By identifying how extremely low and extremely high movement values affect 
the game, designers can find the proper range.
In games with different types of units, such as tanks and infantry, unit move­
ments are based on their relationships. Suppose a tank can move twice as fast as 
infantry. It’s relatively easy to assign a movement value to a tank that’s twice the 
value of an infantry unit’s movement value. However, now designers must test both 
movements to make sure the game works.
If tank movement seems too fast, then its value must be lowered, which will 
directly affect the infantry unit’s movement. Now infantry might appear to move too 
slowly, which means increasing the infantry unit movement, which also increases 
the tank’s movement.
Adjusting movement values of different units can be one way to find the optimal 
values for both types of units. Another option is to adjust the scale of the map. By 
increasing or decreasing the scale of the playing field, designers can adjust the 
movement of units without altering any actual movement values. (Or they can 
do both.)
In video games, movement must match the player’s expectations where the 
game’s setting shapes the player’s expectations. A game where players control dif­
ferent types of World War I biplanes would create a completely different set of 
expectations compared to a science fiction game where players control futuristic 
starship fighters dodging asteroids while firing missiles.
22  Movement Prototypes

219
Ultimately, movement is the way players can get closer to winning the game. 
Test movement until it feels too slow, then test until movement feels too fast. 
Movement should feel fun, engaging, and interesting. Since the bulk of the game 
will involve movement, it’s crucial to make sure all forms of movement create the 
emotional effect that you want players to experience.
Thought Exercise
Pick a board game and cut the way players move in half. Then double or triple its 
movement. How does each type of movement alter gameplay?
Pick a video game and identify its game setting. How does its game setting define 
a player’s expectations for how to move within the game? Imagine if movement 
were halved or doubled, would the movement still match the expectations from the 
game setting?
Movement for Other Purposes
Movement typically changes the location of one or more units so the main purpose 
of movement is to put your units in the best possible position so you can win the 
game. However, movement has several other purposes beyond just changing a phys­
ical location:
•	 Movement for puzzle solving
•	 Movement for resource management
•	 Movement for combat
Many video games offer puzzles for players to solve before they can advance or 
gain the resources needed to deal with upcoming obstacles and enemies. Such puz­
zles often force players to move items to press down on switches, reflect light 
beams, or push items into jumping platforms so the player can reach previously 
inaccessible areas.
This type of movement is meant to solve a puzzle and does not move the player 
physically closer to the game’s goal. However, it may force the player to use exist­
ing movement skills or learn new movement skills to help solve the puzzle.
Movement can also be used for resource management. In the board game 
Monopoly, moving past Go gives players $200 dollars that they can use to pay bills 
or buy properties. In video games, players often need to find a store or trading post 
so they can convert their money or treasures into useful resources such as weapons, 
armor, or tools such as shovels and ropes. In this case, players must move to a store 
or trading post but this movement does not directly get them closer to the overall 
game goal in the same way that ordinary movement does.
Movement for Other Purposes

220
One common use for movement involves movement as combat where moving 
represents a way to defeat enemies. In Super Mario Brothers, players have a choice 
of either avoiding enemies (by jumping over them) or attacking enemies (by jump­
ing on top of them). When movement becomes a form of combat, it can be predict­
able (such as Mario jumping on enemies that works every time) or unpredictable 
(such as fighting games where a player can rush an enemy to knock them down, but 
which may not always succeed if players time their movement wrong).
Movement for puzzles, resource management, or combat should be identical or 
similar to movement used to get players from one location to another. That way 
players don’t have to learn any new type of movement skills.
Thought Exercise
Pick a board game where movement involves resource management or combat. 
How would the game change if this resource management or combat were taken 
away from movement? If a board game does not use movement for resource man­
agement or combat, how would the game change if either of these were added?
Pick a video game that uses movement to solve a puzzle. How is this movement 
necessary to solving the puzzle? If the game were to eliminate movement, how 
would this affect trying to solve the puzzle?
Prototyping Real-Time Movement
Turn-based video games are easy to prototype on paper since such prototypes act 
like board games. However, video games that rely on real-time movement require 
difficult considerations when creating a prototype.
Many video game designers create digital prototypes to test real-time movement, 
but it’s possible to test real-time movement on paper. Real-time movement involves 
a strict time deadline and hidden decisions that only become apparent to other play­
ers or enemies after players have committed to a specific action.
One way paper prototypes can emulate real-time movement is to give players a 
time limit to make decisions (such as 15 seconds), which can be enforced by a 
human referee or a timer. Before this time limit expires, players must choose an 
action and reveal it. This can capture the hectic rush to make decisions in a hurry.
To choose an action, players could write down their choices, but this could be 
tedious. A better solution might be to create options as cards that players can select. 
Now players just need to select an option defined by a card that shows which action 
they chose.
A second option is to let players make decisions simultaneously without a time 
limit. Then players reveal their choices at the same time. By eliminating a time 
limit, a game emphasizes analysis over reaction, which creates a different feel for 
22  Movement Prototypes

221
the game. Such simultaneous movement forces players to anticipate their oppo­
nent’s moves and outthink them. By applying a time limit to this same action, the 
paper prototype suddenly forces players to react faster and more intelligently than 
their opponents.
Note that any paper prototype that emulates real-time movement is just meant to 
capture the feel of gameplay that forces players to make split-second decisions over 
and over again. In first-person shooter games, split-second decisions form the heart 
of the game. The paper prototype can test whether the variety of options available to 
the player is too low or too high, and whether making rapid decisions would be fun 
as the main action in the game.
Thought Exercise
In real-time movement video games, the computer takes care of tracking simultane­
ous movement. In a paper prototype, players need to choose and reveal their actions 
at the same time, with or without a time limit. Pick a video game that uses real-time 
movement and create a paper prototype that mimics the game’s choices and game­
play feeling.
Summary
The two main ways to regulate movement are turn-based and real-time. Turn-based 
movement typically occurs in board games but also many strategy video games as 
well. The idea behind turns is that each player can analyze the current situation, 
make a decision, and then see the results of that decision before another player takes 
their turn.
Turn-based movement emphasizes strategy. On the other hand, real-time move­
ment emphasizes reflexes and quick decision-making along with choosing the best 
strategy within a limited time frame. Real-time movement is commonly found in 
video games but some board games offer a limited form of real-time movement.
To give players greater control, most video games make movement predictable, 
but occasionally video games offer unpredictable movement options that offer 
greater rewards in return for greater risks. Many board games use random move­
ment where players cannot predict how far they may move on each given turn. 
Many simulation board games do offer predictable movement to model movement 
of actual vehicles or military units.
Every movement involves traveling a certain distance. Prototypes must test that 
movement distance so it’s neither too slow or too fast. Adjusting movement can 
involve changing the movement values of various playing pieces or adjusting the 
scale of the playing field map.
Summary

222
Finally, movement can be more than just traveling from one location to another. 
Movement can involve puzzle solving, resource management, or combat. Movement 
should give players multiple options so they can freely express themselves through 
movement within a game.

Chapter 23
Combat Prototypes
Combat prototypes test whether fighting another player or non-player character 
feels fair and realistic for that particular game setting. In a realistic military simula­
tion, weapons would need to look and act like their real world counterparts. 
However, in a fantasy or science fiction setting, weapons would need to look and act 
like what most people believe about those game settings.
For example, people expect a laser to be powerful in a science fiction world, so 
if it barely causes any damage to an ordinary person, players would feel the weapon 
is unrealistic. On the other hand, a bow and arrow in a fantasy game setting would 
likely kill a human if a single arrow hits in the right area, but won’t likely kill a 
much larger animal with one shot such as a dragon.
Combat involves choosing between different types of attacks and different weap­
ons against different enemies and their unique defenses that might minimize or 
negate an attack altogether. Essentially, combat prototypes must test whether a 
game offers enough variety to make every possible type of attack viable under dif­
ferent situations.
Choosing Weapons
In strategy games, playing units might represent entire military divisions such as 
infantry, armor, or artillery. When playing units represent large groups, their attack 
and defense strength is abstracted as an arbitrary number, based on their relationship 
to other playing units.
In tactical games where players control individual units such as swordsmen, sol­
diers, tanks, airplanes, or even ships, combat can get more detailed. Instead of 
assigning an abstract attack/defense strength, games often give players a choice of 
weapons to use where each weapon offers various advantages and disadvantages.

224
A sword might offer the advantage of causing a decent amount of damage while 
letting players hold a shield in the other hand. A halberd is much longer and can 
attack from a further distance while requiring two hands to hold. That means players 
cannot hold a shield. A crossbow offers attacking from a distance, but becomes 
nearly useless in close combat. By offering a variety of weapons for players to 
choose, a game forces players to pick the best weapons for their playing strategy as 
shown in Table 23.1.
Giving players a choice of weapons creates a greater sense of freedom in choos­
ing how to arm themselves. Sometimes weapons have various costs so players must 
balance how much they’re willing to spend in return for the weapons they want (or 
can afford).
Once players choose one or more weapons, they need to master those weapons 
in different settings and against different enemies. The challenge for the game 
designer lies in making sure no weapon is too over-powered (so players use it all the 
time) or under-powered (so players never choose it at all). Every weapon must excel 
against certain enemies and falter (or be completely ineffective) against other 
enemies.
Thought Exercise
Pick a game where players can choose from multiple weapons and notice the differ­
ent characteristics of each weapon such as weight, cost, attack strength, ammunition 
load, etc. Which weapon offers the most power? What is the disadvantage of this 
powerful weapon? Which weapon is the weakest? What is the advantage of this 
weakest weapon?

Are there any two weapons that would make sense to use together? Are there any 
two weapons that have no reason to use together? Is there any weapon optimized for 
specific situations or enemies? If so, what is the weakest weapon for specific situa­
tions and enemies and how can players still use that weakest weapon to still triumph 
in the end?
Determining If an Attack with a Weapon Hits
Just having a weapon is no guarantee that players will hit anything with it. This 
forces players to balance the tradeoff between weapons that cause lots of damage (if 
they hit) vs. weapons that have a high chance of hitting (but cause much less 
damage).
For example, a two-handed broadsword will cause massive damage but it’s 
clumsy to wield, which makes it less likely to hit anything. On the other hand, a club 
is easy for anyone to swing around but it may not cause much damage unless it hap­
pens to hit a vital area like a person’s head.
For greater realism, many games define odds for hitting with a particular weapon 
and additional odds for hitting specific areas of an enemy. This makes it possible to 
hit an enemy but hit a non-vital area (such as armor), causing little or no damage. 
Players also have the chance of getting a lucky hit on a vital area, causing far more 
damage than normal. Adding in chance for hitting and additional chance for hitting 
vital areas creates greater variety that can create surprising and unexpected results.
Hitting an enemy can be a combination of that weapon type, the range between 
the attacker and the defender, the terrain of the defender, and the condition of the 
defender (stunned, demoralized, etc.) as shown in Table 23.2.
Once players determine they hit an enemy, the next step may be determining 
where the damage occurred. This means a player could repeatedly hit an enemy but 
get unlucky enough to hit armored, non-vital areas, or that a player could hit an 
enemy once and get a lucky hit that cripples the target as shown in Table 23.3.
The To Hit table determines the odds of hitting an enemy based on various fac­
tors such as range to target (the further away, the less likelihood of hitting), terrain 
of the defender (towns will provide better protection than open fields), and the type

of weapon attacking (pistols are much weaker with less chance to hit than a flame­
thrower or a rocket launcher).
A To Hit table outlines the odds that an attacker actually hits an enemy. Another 
type of table might be an Effects table that determines where an attacker hit. In man 
to man combat, hitting an enemy in the arm can create a different effect than hitting 
an enemy in the leg. In vehicle combat involving tanks or planes, hitting an engine 
creates a different effect than hitting an exposed gunner or pilot.
Thought Exercise
Pick a board game (such as a wargame, military simulation) and examine the numer­
ous tables needed to create realistic combat results. Wargames require numerous 
tables to add uncertainty to combat. By studying how these multiple tables work and 
interact with one another, you can see how paper wargames simulate combat in a 
particular battle. Such transparency makes playing a paper wargame tedious, but 
clearly shows you how the game works, making it easy to alter the tables to modify 
the gameplay.
In comparison, pick a video game that simulates combat. Because the video 
game calculates results in the background, the way it works remains hidden from 
players, making it difficult to modify or even understand why certain weapons 
behave the way they do.
Dissect a video game and convert it to a paper wargame. Notice how many charts 
and tables you may need to simulate greater realism in the game.
Understanding Combat Results Tables (CRTs)
In some games, combat is 100% certain such as in chess, checkers, or backgammon. 
In games with guaranteed combat results, the best defense is to avoid giving an 
enemy a chance to attack in the first place. Failing that, the second best defense is to

defend vulnerable units. In backgammon, this occurs by covering units so no play­
ing piece is left alone and vulnerable to attack. In chess, players can position other 
playing pieces so an enemy attacking a specific playing piece will lose more than 
they gain, which discourages an attack.
In many other types of games, combat represents a calculated risk. The basic 
dilemma revolves around whether a player should attack an enemy or not and how 
much force to use. The more force applied to a single target, the greater the chance 
of success. The less force applied, the lower the chance of success. Thus players 
must decide, at all times, not only what target they should attack but how much 
force to allocate against this single target.
Since players don’t have unlimited units to attack, the choice becomes whether 
to attack a small number of units that have a greater chance of success or attack a 
larger number of units that have a lower chance of success.
23.4
By studying the Combat Results Table in a board game, players can estimate 
their odds of success and better understand how the game works. Generally, attack­
ers need a 2–1 advantage before attacking. However in video games, the CRT is 
buried as code that’s hidden from view. This means players cannot understand how 
combat works except through trial and error.
Even then, they won’t truly understand how the game’s combat system actually 
works. For this reason, board games can often be more educational in understanding 
game mechanics because all possible details are clearly outlined in plain view.
In strategic games, a Combat Results Table assumes that an attacker can success­
fully hit a defender. In many games, especially those that simulate individual com­
bat, the game must determine if the attacker hit, and then determine where the 
attacker hit as shown in Table 23.5.
So during an attack, players may need to consult three different tables:

and defender strength

Understanding Combat Results Tables (CRTs)

228
•	 To Hit – Checks if the attacker even hit the enemy. If so, check the Effects table.
•	 Effects – Checks to see where the attack hit the enemy.
•	 Damage – Checks to see how much damage the attack caused in the area defined 
by the Effects table.
The combination of a To Hit, Effects, and Combat Results Table combines to create 
greater realism, especially when simulating combat between individual units such 
as soldiers, planes, tanks, or ships. When consulting each type of table, certain con­
ditions may give a modifying advantage to the attacker, the defender, or both.
If the defender is dug into a trench or inside a city, the attacker is at a disadvan­
tage. If the defender is caught in the open at the bottom of a hill, the defender is at 
a disadvantage. To simulate these advantages and disadvantages, games may include 
modifiers for one or more combat tables.
By understanding modifiers that increase or decrease the attacker and defender’s 
strength along with the odds of hitting, board games can give players a deeper 
understanding of the tradeoffs they need to make when deciding when to attack, 
who to attack, and whether the odds of success are worth taking or not.
The advantage of a board game listing game mechanics in various tables is that 
players can develop a better understanding of the game mechanics. The disadvan­
tage is that consulting so many tables can get tedious and time-consuming, making 
it harder to play the game.
With video games, the opposite is true. By hiding the game mechanic details, 
video games are much easier to play, but mask the deeper understanding of its game 
mechanics that a board game can offer.
Since video games cannot force players to consult and understand various tables 
listing the odds of successful combat, video games must rely on the game experi­
ence to teach players odds and choices. For example, a medieval combat game 
might give players a choice of using a dagger (that’s easy to use but causes minimal 
damage) or a battle axe (that’s unwieldy to use but causes extreme damage if it hits).
A board game might represent these weapon differences as tables listing numeric 
values that clearly show how a dagger has a greater chance of hitting but with small 
amounts of damage while a battle axe has a lower chance of hitting but with massive 
amounts of damage.

A video game must convey this information to the player through play. Whipping 
a dagger around should feel fast and fluid, but players should also see that stabbing 
with a dagger causes minimal damage, especially against large enemies such as 
trolls, minotaurs, or dragons.
When players wield a battle axe, their movements should be slower and clumsier, 
making hitting enemies harder. However when the battle axe hits, players should see 
that it causes massive damage. Thus through gameplay can players gradually under­
stand the tradeoffs in weapons and attack strategies in a video game that they could 
easily spot by examining a table in a board game.
Thought Exercise
Pick a video game that allows players to attack enemies, and try to determine a 
Combat Results Table that can predict the odds of attacking. If the video game 
depicts attacks on individual people or vehicles, is there a chance that players will 
attack an enemy but miss? When players attack enemies, can they aim for specific 
areas of the target or is this determined randomly?
Pick a board game and study the Combat Results Table (CRT) to get a better 
understanding how combat works. What type of modifiers can increase or decrease 
the attacker or defender’s strength? How could you translate a board game’s Combat 
Results Table into a video game and make it clear the different odds of success when 
attacking?
Summary
Combat may be the prime purpose of a game (such as in first-person shooter or mili­
tary simulation), or just a minor part of the game (such as in trading or puzzle 
games). If combat is the prime purpose of the game, determining the results of 
combat can get more detailed because that’s the experience players want. If combat 
occurs on a strategic scale or is not the prime purpose of the game, combat can be 
abstracted by just determining combat results.
Combat can vary between 100% certain (backgammon, chess, checkers, etc.) or 
uncertain. Both types of combat styles shape the way players attack and defend. If 
combat is certain, play becomes more strategic in defeating an opponent. If combat 
is uncertain, play may take calculated risks that can turn the tide of a game.
At the simplest level, combat can involve determining whether an attacker’s 
strength is enough to overcome a defender’s strength. When combat involves a com­
parison between an attacker’s strength compared to the defender’s strength, players 
must decide how much force to apply against a defender. This risk involves attack­
ing a few units with a fairly certain outcome or attacking many units with much less 
certainty in the outcome.
Summary

230
More detailed combat may require a To Hits table first to determine if an attack 
even hits a defender. The defender may increase their defensive strength through 
terrain such as defending in a forest or a town that provides additional protection. In 
man to man combat, armor may also prevent an attacker from hitting any vital area 
of the defender.
A game might create even greater realism by including an Effects table that 
determine if an attacker does successfully hit, where the attack actually hits on the 
defender. For individuals, hits might occur on an arm or leg. For vehicles such as 
tanks or planes, hits might occur on the engine, wing, tread, or on the people inside 
the vehicle.
If a player hits (To Hit table) and hits a specific area (Effects table), the final 
result can be determined by a Combat Results Table (CRT) that determines how 
much damage actually occurred. Adding an element of chance makes combat unpre­
dictable and thus more realistic.
There’s always a tradeoff between chance and realism. Too much chance makes 
combat feel unrealistic. Too little chance can make combat too certain and actually 
less enjoyable within the context of a particular game.
Combat represents the way players can overcome enemies, whether as the pri­
mary goal of the game or a secondary means of achieving the main goal. For many 
games, combat is what makes games fun and challenging to play so it’s important to 
test out combat in prototypes as often as possible.

Resource Management Prototypes
In many games, resource management acts as a way to increase your chances of 
winning the game. In role-playing games, players must manage their money and 
inventory so they can buy items such as weapons, armor, healing potions, or food. 
In other games, resource management is the whole purpose of the game. In a stock 
market simulation game, players need to buy and sell stocks. In a city management 
simulation, players must run a city by allocating money for services such as road 
repairs and police protection while taxing citizens.
Resource management is about choosing the following:
•	 Resources
•	 Results
•	 Time
Testing Resources
In any game, players will have a choice of different resources they can choose. In a 
game that lets players control the actions of an individual soldier in modern day 
combat, those resources could be a pistol, rifle, hand grenade, or mortar. In a game 
that lets players control entire armies, those resources might be tanks, machine 
guns, or artillery.
The two types of resources are:
•	 Currency
•	 Game items
Currency represents money that players earn and spend. In Monopoly, currency 
represents actual cash that players earn by passing Go, through luck when drawing

232
cards, or by collecting rent from properties. In a game like Democracy, which puts 
players in charge of a country as president or prime minister, the game’s currency is 
measured in “political capital” that players can spend to make changes.
Players typically collect or earn currency on a regular basis, either in a fixed 
amount (Collect $200 by passing Go) or in varying amounts, depending on the 
player’s current situation in the game. A fixed amount ensures that players will 
always receive something. A varying amount risks players falling into a deepening 
financial hole that they can never recover from, making it impossible to win the 
game past a certain point.
In Monopoly, one player tends to dominate to the point where there’s no way 
other players can possibly win as they’re forced to sell properties with no hope of 
ever getting them back. This means their chances of earning any money keeps going 
down while their chances of paying the dominant player their remaining money 
keeps going up. In every game, this inevitable downward spiral occurs where there’s 
no chance players can possibly win. To mitigate this as much as possible, designers 
may want to keep players in the game as long as possible.
In poker, players can stay in the game as long as they have money. It’s possible 
for players to lose all their money in the first hand, but since players have a choice 
of how much to bet, they have more control over their fate (unlike Monopoly). Since 
poker gives players new hands each game (increasing the chance that they’ll get 
luckier than their opponents), players have a better chance of playing longer and 
staying in the game.
While the object in some games (like poker) is to collect the most currency, other 
games are different. Instead, currency is only useful so players can purchase game 
items and those game items will help players win the game.
Game items provide advantages. In a financial game like Monopoly or a stock 
market simulation, game items represent investments that can earn more currency. 
By investing well, players can increase their currency hoard so they can buy even 
more game items.
In other video games, game items may increase a player’s attack or defense capa­
bilities. This indirectly helps players defeat enemies so they can collect more trea­
sures that represents another form of currency. The fun comes from deciding which 
game items to buy based on their cost and advantages.
To test resources, a prototype should define how players earn currency. 
Experiment with giving players no currency and then unlimited currency to see how 
that affects the gameplay. Then test various currency levels for how much players 
start with and how much players earn periodically. Test also for how often players 
should receive currency.
Create multiple game items at different prices: inexpensive, medium, and expen­
sive. Each game item should provide different ways to generate additional currency 
either directly (such as properties in Monopoly) or indirectly (such as armor and 
weapons in a role-playing game that increase a player’s chances of surviving a bat­
tle so they can loot a dungeon). The trick lies in balancing the cost of a game item 
compared to its advantages.
24  Resource Management Prototypes

233
No game item should be better or worse than any other game item. What will 
determine which game item is better or worse will be the circumstances of the 
game, which will be different in every game. If one game item were inherently 
superior to the others, there would be no reason for players to choose any other 
game item. Thus the superiority (or inferiority) of a game item occurs only through 
the current events in the game.
Thought Exercise
Pick a board game that involves resource management (typically money) and iden­
tify how much each player starts with and how much they earn periodically. What 
happens if you change the starting currency amount? What happens if you change 
how much players earn periodically? What happens if you change how often players 
receive additional currency?
Game items typically range in price from inexpensive, medium, and expensive. 
Think of the different prices for properties in Monopoly such as the cost of Park 
Place (expensive) to Baltic Avenue (inexpensive).
Pick the cheapest game item. What is the advantage of buying this game item? 
What is the disadvantage? Pick the most expensive game item. What is the advan­
tage of buying this game item? What is the disadvantage?
In your game prototype, define the following:
•	 The currency used in your game
•	 The amount of currency players start with
•	 The amount of currency players receive periodically (and how often players 
receive this currency)
Knowing the currency in your game prototype, define the following:
•	 How many different game items (choices) are available
•	 The pros and cons of each game item to ensure none are overwhelmingly domi­
nant or completely useless
•	 The cost of each game item
Testing the Results of Game Items
Players buy game items to increase their chances of winning. The challenge lies in 
choosing which game items to buy and use. That means all game items must be as 
equal as possible. Otherwise players may just choose one game item all the time or 
ignore other game items all the time.
What makes each game item superior (or inferior) to another lies with its rela­
tionship to the current game condition. So for every game item, there must be a 
Testing the Results of Game Items

234
moment when that game item is superior to every other game item, completely 
inferior to every other game item, and neither good nor bad compared to every other 
game item.
Although every game item must be equal, they offer varying ratios of risk vs. 
reward such as:
•	 High risk, high reward
•	 Medium risk, medium reward
•	 Low risk, low reward
In many first-person shooter games, players can choose from a variety of weapons. 
A pistol might cost the least but causes minimal damage. A rifle costs more but 
causes more damage. A gatling gun costs (and weighs) much more, but causes a 
large amount of damage.
Which weapon players choose can vary depending on cost, weight, and ammuni­
tion requirements. To test out these costs, risks, and rewards, start with just three 
game items that represent the High, Medium, and Low risk/reward.
Make sure the High risk/reward item is the highest/strongest/most expensive 
item. Based on these characteristics, make sure the Low risk/reward item is the low­
est/weakest/least expensive item. Then choose an item that falls in the exact middle 
as a Middle risk/reward item.
The purpose of just prototyping with three game items is to test the high and low 
extremes. By experimenting with the extreme high and low game items, you can 
adjust their values until they work within the game where working depends more on 
the feel of the game rather than any specific types of metrics. Defining the high and 
low values sets the boundaries for all other game items.
In Monopoly, the extreme low values are represented by Baltic Avenue and 
Mediterranean Avenue while the extreme high values are represented by Boardwalk 
and Park Place. Every other property falls within the range of these two extremes.
In Doom, the extreme weakest weapon is the player’s own fists that can punch an 
enemy. The extreme strongest weapon is the BFG 9000.
In stock market simulation games, the High, Medium, and Low risk items are 
often stocks (High risk/reward), mutual funds (Medium risk/reward), and bonds 
(Low risk/reward).
By simply starting with these High, Medium, and Low game items, you can test 
these values and once they work, it’s easy to add additional items that fit within 
these extreme high and low boundaries.
Thought Exercise
Pick a game that has a resource management system and identify the High, Medium, 
and Low risk/reward game values. How would the game change if the High value 
game item doubled in cost? How would the game change if the Low value game 
item cost were cut in half?
24  Resource Management Prototypes

235
To create a fair resource management system in your own game prototype, 
focus on:
•	 Making sure players never have too much or too little currency to purchase 
game items
•	 Making sure that all game items can be superior (and inferior) depending on the 
current game conditions
Testing Short and Long-Term Time Limits
In most games, players have currency that they can use to buy game items that have 
an effect on the game right away, such as choosing a more powerful weapon. 
However, some games introduce a time element where players can invest in a game 
item that will not produce any benefits until sometime in the future.
This forces players to decide whether to buy game items that can make an imme­
diate impact now, or invest in game items that can’t be used until later. Just as with 
game items with High, Medium, and Low risk/reward, so should there be game 
items with High, Medium, and Low time limits.
A Low time limit means the game item can be useful right away. A Medium time 
limit means the game item can’t be used right away but can be used relatively soon. 
A High time limit means the game item won’t be useful until a long period of 
time passes.
The longer the time restriction, the greater the benefit. The shorter the time 
restriction, the lower the benefit.
In the military simulation, Hearts of Iron, players control entire countries during 
World War Two. A Low time limit allows players to buy equipment (planes, tanks, 
ships) that can fight battles right away. A Medium time limit allows players to invest 
in more advanced equipment that won’t be available depending on how much play­
ers invest in research and development.
The challenge is that if players focus solely on buying equipment with Low time 
limits, eventually their equipment will become obsolete. This forces them to spend 
currency buying equipment they can use right away (Low time limit) as well as 
investing in more advanced equipment (Medium time limit) that will be ready in 
the future.
If players fail to invest in more advanced technology, they risk having their 
armies wiped out by opponents with more advanced technology. If players invest in 
too much advanced technology, they risk getting wiped out in the present.
High time limit items represent the greatest risk with the greater reward. In 
Hearts of Iron, players might invest in jet fighter planes, rockets, or atom bombs. 
The time needed to fully research these most advanced weapons take the longest, 
but their impact could be devastating if players can introduce them before their 
opponents can.
Testing Short and Long-Term Time Limits

236
By having game items that offer benefits with different time limits, games create 
additional challenges for players to consider. If players buy inexpensive (Low risk) 
items now, they’ll risk not having better items in the future. If they invest in better 
(High risk) items for the future, they’ll risk not surviving long enough to reap the 
benefits of their long-term investments.
Resource management involves making choices that often involve:
•	 Cost
•	 Combat strength
•	 Weight
•	 Size
•	 Time to receive any benefits
Resource management with time limits forces players to think tactically (the pres­
ent) and strategically (the future).
Thought Exercise
Game items often return benefits that increase the chance of winning. This can 
mean more:
•	 Currency
•	 Additional game items
•	 Greater combat strength
The sole purpose of buying any game items is to increase the odds of winning. 
Players must choose game items that match their strategy while also choosing game 
items that will help them defeat any other player’s strategies.
Test to make sure any game items with time limits don’t take too long so players 
can actually use them. Test to make sure players have an incentive to invest in game 
items with Medium risk/reward/time limits in addition to buying game items with 
Low risk/reward/time limits. Test to make sure it’s possible for players to get any 
High risk/reward/time limit game items.
Time limits force players to plan ahead and devote precious currency to balance 
between immediate benefits, medium-term benefits, and long-term benefits. This 
balancing act makes resource management challenging and fun.
Summary
Resource management may be the core mechanic of a game or just one part of the 
game. In either case, resource management should be fun, interesting, and challeng­
ing. Players should have a variety of options to choose but no single option should 
ever be dominant (and no single option should ever be completely useless). By 
24  Resource Management Prototypes

237
making every single option equal but different in some way, players have the free­
dom to choose the game items they want.
To purchase game items, players need to earn currency. This currency can be 
money, experience points, or any other measurement unit that fits your particular 
game. Currency can buy game items, which can then create more currency directly 
or indirectly.
When deciding which game items to buy, players must balance the pros and cons 
of each since in a balanced game, all game items should be equal. One of the biggest 
choices players may make is choosing game items based on time.
Short-term time limits mean players can buy and use a game item right away. 
Long-term time limits mean players must invest in a game item and can only receive 
the benefits sometime in the future. This can mean gaining a huge advantage but 
players must last long enough to gain this advantage.
Resource management is all about testing different values for currency and game 
items. Start with the extreme high and low values to define the boundaries of accept­
able values. Then it will be easy to fill in additional game items within these two 
extreme boundaries.
Ultimately, resource management is all about increasing the chances a player can 
win the game based on the short-term and long-term decisions they make.

Puzzle Prototypes
Puzzles act like locked doors. Players encounter a puzzle (locked door) and then 
must figure out how to solve this puzzle (unlock the door). Once they do this, they 
can continue the game beyond the puzzle.
Some games are nothing but puzzles such as Candy Crush or Tetris, which con­
stantly challenges players to match or align objects on the screen. Other games 
include puzzles as obstacles for players to overcome. Sometimes players can still 
play the game without solving the puzzle but other times they must solve the puzzle 
to continue playing.
When designing puzzles, follow these guidelines:
•	 The puzzle must have one (or more solutions) so it can be solved
•	 The puzzle cannot be too easy
•	 All clues needed to solve the puzzle are in plain sight
­
25.1
Solving a puzzle requires the following:
•	 One or more steps
•	 A core mechanic (spatial manipulation, word play, number play, matching, 
speed, logic)
The simplest puzzle requires one step to solve, such as a locked door with a key on 
the floor. Players simply need to pick up the key to unlock the door. However, if the 
key is hidden, that adds an additional step. If players need to find a chest that con­
tains the key, that adds another step. Each additional step makes the puzzle progres­
sively harder to solve because each step must be completed in the right order.

When creating puzzles, decide from the start if there will be just one solution or 
multiple solutions. With crossword puzzles, there’s only one possible word that can 
solve each part of the puzzle. With a Rubik’s cube, there are multiple ways to solve 
the puzzle.
Once players solve a single solution puzzle, there’s little enjoyment to solving it 
again. Puzzles that offer multiple solutions can be played over and over again, but 
their very nature means they tend to be less detailed and more abstract (think Tetris 
or a Rubik’s cube).
To test puzzle prototypes, make sure players know the following:
•	 What goal they’re trying to achieve
•	 The core mechanic for solving the puzzle
•	 How to interpret positive and negative feedback
Defining Puzzle Solutions
Puzzles are only interesting if players know what they’re supposed to achieve and 
how they’re supposed to achieve it. Therefore the first step in testing a puzzle proto­
type is to determine if people understand what the puzzle is and how to go about 
solving it.
That means the rules for solving puzzles tend to be simple. The challenge doesn’t 
lie in the restrictions of the rules but in the nature of the puzzle itself. For example, 
the rules for solving a crossword puzzle are simple:
•	 Read the clues for each vertical or horizontal line of a puzzle
25  Puzzle Prototypes

241
•	 Fill in that line of boxes where only one letter appears in each box
Although the rules for a puzzle may be simple, finding the right solution is not and 
that’s where the challenge lies. In many video games, players must solve a puzzle 
that involves a locked door. The rule is simple: find the key that unlocks that door. 
The challenge lies in finding where that key might be, which requires deciphering 
clues sprinkled around the game.
Finding the key is the solution (and opening the door with the key is trivial). The 
challenge is figuring out where the key might be. A poor puzzle might force players 
to exhaustively search an area for the key. A much better puzzle might require the 
player to decipher clues they found earlier in the game. Once players correctly deci­
pher these clues, these clues lead the player to the key.
So the puzzle solution must be clear. Then the rules must be simple. Finally, 
there must be clues to help players follow the rules to find the solution. This combi­
nation of a clear solution, simple rules, and clues must exist in a puzzle so a puzzle 
prototype can verify that all of these features exist in your puzzle design.
Think how a Rubik’s cube meets these criteria:
•	 Puzzle solution – Displays one color on each side of the cube.
•	 Puzzle rules – Turn, rotate, and manipulate rows of cubes.
•	 Puzzle clues – The colors visually show how close (or far away) you are from the 
solution.
Thought Exercise
Pick a physical puzzle. Can you understand the goal you must achieve to solve the 
puzzle? Are the rules simple to understand? What clues does the puzzle offer to help 
you find the solution?
Pick a puzzle in a video game that you like. Can you understand the goal you 
must achieve to solve the puzzle? Are the rules simple to understand? What clues 
does the puzzle offer to help you find the solution?
Pick a puzzle (in a video game) that you think is unfair or poorly designed. Do 
you dislike it because the solution is unclear? The rules aren’t simple and easy to 
understand? The clues are too confusing to help you solve the puzzle?
If you have a puzzle prototype, show it to others and ask them to identify the 
following:
•	 Does the puzzle make it clear what the solution is that players need to achieve?
•	 Are the rules of the puzzle simple and easy to understand?
•	 Does the puzzle provide clues to help players find a solution (and are those clues 
too easy or too hard)?
When testing a puzzle prototype, the key are the clues. If the clues are too hard to 
understand, the puzzle will be too frustrating. If the clues are too easy, the puzzle 
Thought Exercise

242
won’t be challenging enough. When testing a puzzle prototype, focus on making the 
clues easy to understand but challenging to use.
The different colors of a Rubik’s cube makes these clues easy to understand 
while still challenging players how to manipulate the cube next. The clues in a 
crossword puzzle describes the right word so players must decipher the deliberately 
vague clue based on the number of letters of the word along with occasional letters 
intersecting from other known words of the crossword puzzle.
Testing Core Mechanics
The solution to a puzzle should be clear to both players and the puzzle designer. 
What makes a game fun is the core mechanic or rules that players must repeat over 
and over again. With a Rubik’s cube, the core mechanic involves manipulating rows 
in different directions. With a crossword puzzle, the core mechanic involves filling 
in boxes with letters that form a single word. With Tetris, the core mechanic involves 
manipulating different geometric shapes as they fall.
The puzzle’s core mechanic is where the challenge and fun lies. In a poor puzzle, 
this repetitive core mechanic is simply not fun to do because it’s tedious and boring. 
Think of a combination lock where players must exhaustively try different three-­
digit combinations until they open it. The constant and likely failure of each attempt 
is simply not fun because there’s no choice.
25.2
Crossword puzzles can be frustrating because some clues are simply too hard to 
understand. However, players can choose which clues to solve first, and each time 
they solve one clue, the letters intersect to provide clues for letters that make up the 
missing words.
Puzzles are fun because the core mechanics keep getting players closer to the 
solution. Because of this positive feedback, even the most challenging puzzles can 
be hard to put down when players feel that they’re on the verge of solving the puzzle.
If puzzles are used throughout a video game, those puzzles often get progres­
sively harder and more complicated. The goal is to teach players new skills and 
ways to solve similar puzzle, which will later help them win the game.
Thought Exercise
Pick a puzzle and identify the core mechanic players must repeat. What makes this 
core mechanic interesting? How does this core mechanic help players get one step 
closer to the solution?
25  Puzzle Prototypes

243
 
Thought Exercise

244
In Tetris, the random appearance of geometric shapes keeps surprising players 
and forcing them to make split-second decisions on how best to manipulate and 
place it. On the other hand, trying to find the three-digit combination to a lock is not 
fun because each failed combination does nothing but eliminate one possible com­
bination out of thousands. Because progress is so slow, trying different three-digit 
combinations is not fun.
In your puzzle prototype, what is the core mechanic players must repeat? Is this 
repetitive core mechanic fun by offering players choices? Does this core mechanic 
get players closer to the solution?
Testing Puzzle Clues
Clues serve two purposes in a puzzle. First, clues give players a direction and guid­
ance for how to solve the puzzle. Second, clues should provide feedback letting 
players know how close (or far) they’re getting to the solution of the puzzle.
­
25.3
So clues serve two purposes in a puzzle:
•	 Clues point players in the right direction to solving the puzzle.
•	 Each time players solve one clue, it’s easier to solve other clues
Clues provide positive feedback that keeps giving players a sense of progress. 
Solving one row or column in a Sudoku puzzle gives players confidence they can 
solve another row or column. On the other hand, exhaustively trying three-digit 
combinations on a lock offers no clues for how to get started or how close the 
player’s guesses might be.
When creating a puzzle prototype, make sure that clues give players a direction 
and create a positive feedback loop that make the puzzle’s solution increasingly 
easier to solve.
Thought Exercise
Pick a puzzle and notice what clues the puzzle offers to get you started in the right 
direction. Are these initial clues helpful and clear? When you solve one clue, does 
this help you solve other clues?
Show your puzzle prototype to others and ask them to identify the initial clues 
your puzzle offers. Then ask them to identify whether solving one clue helps them 
solve another clue.
25  Puzzle Prototypes

245
 
Adding a Theme to a Puzzle
Since puzzles often involve manipulating objects (of different shapes, colors, or 
sizes), words, or numbers, puzzles often add a theme that provides a larger game 
world. Candy Crush uses the idea of colorful candy pieces for players to manipu­
late. Jigsaw puzzles display images such as landscapes, famous landmarks, or ani­
mals in the wild. Even crossword puzzles may contain clues where the words are 
related to a specific topic such as sports, movies, or popular songs.
25.4
Puzzles that are obstacles in a video game often reflect the theme of the overall 
game. A video game set in the future might contain puzzles involving computer 
hacking. Yet a similar video game set in medieval times might contain the exact 
same puzzle but with a historical theme to match the game’s setting. Themes are 
optional but colorful ways to make puzzles more enjoyable.
Adding a Theme to a Puzzle

246
 
Thought Exercise
Pick a puzzle and identify whether it has or does not have a theme. If the puzzle has 
a theme, how does this theme make the puzzle more enjoyable? If the puzzle lacks 
a theme, does this omission make the puzzle less enjoyable?
In your own puzzle prototype, ask if a theme would make the puzzle easier to 
understand and fun to play.
Making Puzzles Solvable
No matter how difficult a puzzle may appear on the surface, every puzzle must be 
solvable. When puzzles are the sole purpose of play, such as crossword puzzles or 
Rubik’s cubes, players know they can find a solution eventually. When puzzles 
appear in video games, sometimes puzzles may seem unsolvable.
25  Puzzle Prototypes

247
If players can’t solve a video game puzzle, there are several choices:
•	 Allow players to skip the puzzle.
•	 Provide hints that players can receive, often at a cost.
•	 Provide multiple ways to solve a puzzle to increase the odds that players will find 
at least one solution.
•	 Provide various difficulty levels that players can choose (Easy, Medium, or Hard).
Puzzles in video games should never completely halt a player’s progress because 
that can create a frustrating experience where players risk just quitting the game 
altogether. Ideally, every puzzle should be solvable, but because people of different 
skill levels, experience, and knowledge may attempt the puzzle, puzzles designers 
should plan for alternates.
Puzzles should be obstacles that players feel provide a challenge that they can 
overcome. Thus creating a puzzle will always involve a tradeoff between being too 
easy and being too hard.
Thought Exercise
Pick a physical puzzle. How can players get help if they get stuck? Pick a puzzle in 
a video game. What happens if players get stuck?
In your own puzzle prototype, what happens if players get stuck? What alterna­
tives will your puzzle offer in case players can’t find the solution?
Summary
Puzzles can either be the sole purpose of a game or an obstacle within a game. 
Resource management challenges are often puzzles in disguise that force players to 
make tradeoffs between which resources to cultivate and how long to nurture them.
Puzzles need a clear solution that’s obvious for players to solve. Clues provide 
players with a direction to take for solving the puzzle. Clues must get players started 
and help them solve additional clues in an increasingly positive feedback loop. The 
more clues players solve, the easier it will be to solve all remaining clues.
Rules represent simple mechanics that players must do repetitively to solve the 
puzzle. This combination of a clear goal, simple rules, and clues provide the basis 
for creating a challenging and enjoyable puzzle.
Above all, make sure every puzzle can be solved. Since not every person will be 
able to solve a puzzle, plan for alternatives that can help players solve your puzzle 
eventually. The goal of every puzzle is not to frustrate or block players, but to pro­
vide them with a fun challenge that forces them to think and experiment until they 
find the right answer, even if they need a hint now and then.

Selling a Game to the Market
Game ideas are meant to be completed. Whether the game makes millions of dollars 
or nothing at all, the main goal is to complete the game idea you started because that 
experience of completing a game will give you the confidence that you can tackle a 
larger, more ambitious project in the future. If you start a game but never complete 
it, you’ll never have that confidence that you can finish a project.
Completing a game is crucial, but you may have multiple goals for completing a 
game such as:
•	 Testing a game concept
•	 Learning a particular game engine
•	 Learning a particular programming language
•	 Making a social statement
•	 Learning a new skill (such as graphics design, level design, programming, sound 
design, etc.)
•	 Creating a game to give away for others to enjoy
•	 Creating a game to add to your portfolio
•	 Creating a game to learn about submitting games to an app store
•	 Creating a game as a hobby
•	 Creating a game to improve upon an existing game to show you can do it better
•	 Creating a game to make money
In other words, there are many reasons why you might want to complete a game 
beyond just making money. Whether that game is super primitive and ugly or visu­
ally stunning and exciting, what matters is that you finish your project. Before you 
start any new project, identify the outcome you want to achieve.
Then outline the steps you plan to take so you can achieve that outcome. These 
steps may actually be wrong or misleading, but you need a plan to follow so you 
make steady progress towards your goal.

Even if your planned steps don’t work, you’ll be forced to find a new step that 
will get you closer to your desired outcome. It’s not important that your plan be 
flawless. In fact, it’s far more likely that your plan will be flawed either by missing 
steps or including steps that may not be useful. The process of following your plan 
will identify which steps are right or wrong, and that will give you valuable experi­
ence for the next game project you tackle.
Ultimately, the goal of completing a game is to give you experience, knowledge, 
and confidence to create another game. The more games you create, the easier it will 
get and the more challenging ideas you can pursue. Game design most likely won’t 
be a get rich quick scheme but a long marathon of constant learning, failure, and 
frustration. In the end, the rewards can be immensely satisfying.
Thought Exercise
Identify the main reason why you want to create a game. Even if you plan for a 
game to make money, it’s not a failure if it doesn’t make you a millionaire over­
night. Most games earn a little money but not enough to provide a full-time income 
for the developer.
Think of each game you make as another step towards stretching your capabili­
ties, giving you more experience in game design and creation, and forcing you to 
better understand the marketing and business aspect of game development.
Over time, all of these skills and experiences will simply give you more oppor­
tunities to create more, bigger, and better games in the future.
Create a plan for turning a rough idea into a complete game that someone else 
can play. Having a deadline will force you to keep working on your game even if it’s 
just an hour or less a day.
Becoming a Professional Game Developer
Many people dream about becoming a game developer, but far too many people fail 
to pursue their dreams. Even those who pursue their dreams often give up too soon 
at the first sign of discouragement.
Whatever you want to do, you can do it. The quickest route to disappointment is 
to wait for someone else to give you permission to do what you want. The surest 
route to success is to give yourself permission to do what you want regardless of 
your circumstances, education, resources, or what others around you might say.
If you want to design games, you may think you need to get a job with a large 
game studio. The truth is that you can start designing games right now whether 
anyone recognizes your talent and skills or not.
Never wait for permission to pursue your dream or you risk waiting forever.
Some common paths people take to becoming a game designer includes:
26  Selling a Game to the Market

251
•	 Getting a job in the gaming industry, preferably with a large game studio
•	 Working with an independent (indie) game developer in a team
•	 Working as a solo game developer
Most people aspiring to become game designers and developers pursue the obvious 
route of getting a job in the gaming industry. The advantage is that you get to work 
in the gaming industry so you can get paid to learn from other professionals and 
spend your time working on games.
The disadvantage is that not every job in the gaming industry will be interesting. 
You may get stuck in a niche performing necessary tasks but limiting your exposure 
to other parts of game design. If you’re stuck in a job where you’re not learning 
other aspects of game development and you’re working long hours to make games 
that other people have designed, you may not have time to nurture your own skills 
in designing and developing games.
This trap can also apply to anyone who fails to get a job in the gaming industry 
but gets a job in another industry. That job may not give you time or experience 
designing games. Instead, the job may give you a steady income and the illusion of 
security, but it’s still up to you to take what little free time you have to continue 
studying and designing games because nobody else will care about your dream of 
designing games more than you.
That means even if you’re stuck in a boring job, no matter how well paid it might 
be, you must still learn in your spare time as much as you can about game design 
and development so you can achieve your ultimate dream of making a game of 
your own.
Rather than work for a large company where you risk getting stuck in a limited 
role, you might also work for an indie game developer that consists of a small team. 
Working for an indie game developer most likely means less money, but because 
there are fewer people on the team, it does mean more experience doing two or 
more jobs.
Since there are more indie game developers than large game studios, it can be 
easier to find a job with one of them. In addition, you’ll likely gain far more experi­
ence working for an indie game developer since teams will be smaller, forcing 
everyone to do multiple tasks. The drawback may be that the pay and job could be 
less secure and you may work hard and get less security, benefits, and money.
No matter what happens, you can always pursue the solo game developer route. 
This will force you to learn all aspects of game development including marketing, 
graphics design, sound design, programming, and advertising. Best of all, anyone 
can become a solo game developer.
The drawback is that solo game developers must do everything themselves (or 
with a small team) and being a solo game developer means performing tasks that 
may have little to do with game design (such as marketing, accounting, and 
advertising).
No matter which route you take, there will always be a way for you to become a 
game developer either on your own, with an indie team, or with a large game studio. 
All options have their pros and cons but they all give you an opportunity to become 
Becoming a Professional Game Developer

252
part of the gaming industry in one form or another. If you want to make games, the 
only thing stopping you is your own fear, reluctance, and uncertainty, and that’s 
something only you can overcome.
Thought Exercise
Make plans for how you could get a job at a large gaming studio, at an indie gaming 
studio, or just become a solo game developer. Which option looks most appealing to 
you and why? Which option looks easiest to you and why? Which option looks 
hardest to you and what can you do to make it easier?
If you have to take a job just to pay your bills, how can you structure your free 
time to continue pursuing your dream of game designing? If you lack certain skills, 
such as graphics design or programming, what plan can you create to help you over­
come those deficiencies (take a class, read a book, hire someone to do this task for 
you, etc.)?
Making Money with Games
You can make money designing games. You can also make money selling toilet 
paper, paperclips, ball bearings, and rubber gloves. If your sole goal is to make 
money, there are easier ways to do this than by making games.
You should only pursue game design if that’s what you want to do. Then find a 
way to make money doing it. If you want to make money from a game, the best time 
to start planning how you’ll make money from a game is before you start making 
that game.
Once you’ve created a plan for making money from your game, you can then 
design your game to optimize your chances of making money. If you make a game 
first and then try to figure out how to make money from it later, your game won’t be 
optimized to make money so the entire process will be much harder.
There are multiple ways to make money from a game. Some common ways 
include:
•	 Selling a game to another company and collecting royalties
•	 Selling a game direct to consumers
•	 Making money from in-app purchases
•	 Making money from advertising
•	 Making money from a crowd funding site
•	 Working on a game for a gaming studio
•	 Selling your source code
•	 Applying your game design skills in non-gaming industries
26  Selling a Game to the Market

253
In the old days before the Internet, game designers could make a game by either 
working for a larger company or selling their completed game to a larger company. 
This larger company then spent money to duplicate the game, package the game, 
ship the game to distributors, and then take a percentage of the profit while paying 
a royalty for each game sold.
With royalties, the game designer can focus on making games and let a game 
company take care of printing, production, packaging, marketing, distribution, and 
advertising. This process is still available, but the high cost of packaging and ship­
ping increasingly makes this path only viable for a limited number of games. While 
card and board games still need to be sold through a distributor, video games can 
now avoid distributors and go straight to consumers.
The most direct way to make money is to sell a game straight to consumers 
through an online gaming store platform like Steam (store.steampowered.com/
games), BattleNet (us.shop.battle.net), GOG (www.gog.com), Epic Games Store 
(store.epicgames.com), or GamersGate (www.gamersgate.com).
The advantage of selling directly to consumers is that you don’t need permission 
from any game company and you keep the bulk of the game sales with a percentage 
of each sale going to the online gaming store platform.
The disadvantage of selling through an online gaming store platform is that each 
platform already offers hundreds, if not thousands, of games so the odds of consum­
ers finding your particular game is low.
Although online gaming stores can reach thousands of people, most of those 
people will never know your game exists. That means you must spend time market­
ing and promoting your game separate from any time spent designing more games.
To promote games, game developers often rely on periodic sales to attract atten­
tion. That way some people will buy the game and those people will likely tell oth­
ers about it. In the mobile game market, game developers initially tried selling their 
games, but many people were reluctant to buy anything without a chance to try the 
game out first.
The next strategy mobile game developers used was to offer two versions of their 
game. A free version gave people a taste of how the game worked. If people liked 
the game, they could buy the paid version that offered more challenges and longer 
gameplay.
Finally, mobile game developers found the most success with free games that 
completely lowered the barrier to trying out the game. If people liked the game, they 
could buy in-app purchases that added new features to the game. Another variation 
was free games that included advertising that paid the developers. Free to play 
games quickly dominated the market because they made finding new games 
risk-free.
Since making a new game from scratch takes time and money, the biggest risk is 
funding a game long enough to bring it to market, and keeping it on the market long 
enough for it to start making money. To eliminate this problem, many game devel­
opers post their projects on crowd funding sites to raise money. Once they have the 
money to make the game, it’s simply a race to make that game before the crowd-­
funded money runs out.
Making Money with Games

254
Because making a game and trying to sell it on your own can be so time-­
consuming, difficult, and costly, many game developers prefer to make a game 
under contract with a larger gaming studio. That way the gaming studio takes all the 
financial risk, but they also take the bulk of the profits as well.
Every year, hundreds, if not thousands, of games appear on the market where 
most of them will barely break even or actually lose money. To recoup the cost of 
making a game, many game developers recycle their source code. One way to do 
this is to create a similar game but with different graphics, story background, and 
setting. So if you make a first-person shooter game based on a science fiction world, 
you might recycle the source code to create a similar first-person shooter game 
based on a historical world filled with gunslingers, bounty hunters, and sheriffs. 
Each time you recycle the source code, you can improve it and thus create a new 
game in much less time and expense.
A final way to recycle source code is to sell it. Many sites let developers sell their 
source code so that others can modify it and create their own games. Selling source 
code can be a way to profit from a failed game.
Although many people want to make games, many game designers and develop­
ers learn unique skills that can be applied to non-gaming industries. Since video 
games increasingly display realistic images, the television and movie industry often 
relies on game engines to create special effects faster and cheaper than before.
Architects, automotive designers, and aircraft manufacturers use game engines 
to model buildings, cars, and planes completely within a computer before they 
spend time making physical prototypes. Even though you may want to make games, 
any skills you develop as a game designer can be useful in so many industries out­
side of the traditional gaming world.
With so many ways to make money from a game, start by shaping your game 
around one or more money-making techniques. Making a game takes time and 
money with no guarantee of success, much like making a movie, writing a novel, or 
painting a picture.
Don’t make games because you think you’ll get rich. Make games because you 
want to make games, but make sure you look at how to profit from your hard work 
as well. Here are some guidelines for increasing your odds of making money mak­
ing games:
•	 Make games that you find interesting. (Don’t chase trends and create copy­
cat games.)
•	 Make games with a distinctive visual and narrative style. (Don’t make games that 
look and feel like other games.)
•	 Target a niche. (Don’t try to make games that appeal to everyone because they’ll 
wind up appealing to no one.)
•	 Make the best game you can. (Don’t think you can slap a game together quickly 
just to make money.)

Summary
Whether you make a full-time income, a part-time income, or just occasional money 
from a game, the important goal is to make games because you enjoy doing so and 
find the process fun and challenging. Ideally, you want to get paid as much as pos­
sible for your work, but that likely won’t happen from your first game or even your 
tenth game.
However, the more games you make, the more experience and knowledgeable 
you’ll get, and the better and more sophisticated games you can create. As long as 
you enjoy making games and keep moving forward, you’ll find success in one form 
or another.
The profit from making games involves more than just money. There’s also the 
satisfaction that comes from setting a goal for yourself and achieving it. That type 
of emotional satisfaction that comes from facing the unknown, overcoming chal­
lenges, trusting yourself, and creating something tangible out of your imagination is 
something that’s too often absent from ordinary jobs.
Making games can be nearly as fun as playing them, so keep making games and 
keep having fun. You can make people happy through games, but you’ll never know 
how many people’s lives you might affect until you make a game of your own.
So what are you waiting for? Start making a game today. There’s a whole world 
out there just waiting to see what you might create.

Appendix A: Gaming Supplies and Open Source Video Games
If you’re interested in making a paper-based game such as a board game or a card 
game, it’s easy to make pieces from ordinary office supplies. You can use index 
cards, cardboard, colored paper, and pieces from existing games like dice or playing 
pieces to make quick paper prototypes. If you need to create more polished paper 
prototypes, consider buying game supplies from online sources such as:
•	 BoardGamesMaker.com
•	 Gameparts.net
•	 99centgameparts.com.
If you’re interested in creating video games, nearly every game engine offers tutori­
als and sample games you can study. That way you can modify the source code and 
add graphic assets to change the game.
However, you can also learn the intricacies of video games by studying open 
source video games. Such open source video games allow you to examine the com­
plete working source code and multimedia assets (graphics and audio) so you can 
not only see how they work together, but also make your own changes to the game 
mechanics, user interface, or graphic appearance.
Open source video games typically mimic popular video games or video game 
genres such as first-person shooters or strategy games with a 2.5D perspective. 
Some popular open source video games include:
•	 0 A.D. (play0ad.com), an empire building strategy game like Age of Empires.
•	 Armagetron Advanced (www.armagetronad.org), a 3D version of Tron.
•	 Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead (cataclysmdda.org), a turn-based survival game set 
in a post-apocalyptic world.

If you’re interested in working in the gaming industry but don’t yet have experience, 
contributing to an open source video game can give you that valuable experience.
Keep track of what you contribute, what you learned, and what skills you devel­

Appendix B: PC Bootup Game Rules
PC Boot Up is a card game for two or more players where players attempt to be the 
first one to boot up their computer. Players use cards that represent different pro­
grams, problems, and solutions to boot up a PC and hinder other players from boot­
ing up their PCs. The game is meant to teach people the common types of problems 
that could prevent a computer from booting up along with the specific solution to 
solve each problem.
Game Components
PC Boot Up is a card game that consists of four types of cards:
•	 Problems
•	 Solutions
•	 Safeties
•	 Programs
Appendices

259
Problem Cards
Problems cards are used to prevent another player’s PC from booting up. A player 
must eliminate all Problem cards (by using a Solution or Safety card) in order to 
play a Program card. It is possible to play one or more Problem cards against 
another player.
The seven types of Problem cards are labeled Bug, Disk Fragmentation, Registry 
Failure, Virus, Hacker, Crash, and Trojan Horse. Players cannot finish booting up 
their PC until they eliminate all Problem cards from their PC.
Bug – represents a common error that can suddenly cause any program, such as an 
operating system or word processor, to act erratically or stop working altogether. 
All software contains bugs, which means that all programs can suffer problems 
caused by a bug.
Disk Fragmentation – represents a problem with the way some operating systems 
store files on a hard disk. When an operating system stores files as closely as pos­
sible, changing or deleting a file can leave empty gaps between existing files. 
When you add a new file, the operating system stores part of a new file in one gap 
and part of that same file in another gap, causing fragmentation even if your hard 
disk is largely empty.
Registry Failure – represents a common problem with some operating systems that 
use a special database called a registry, which every program uses to store data. 
Because every program needs to use the registry and multiple programs modify 
the registry contents all the time, it’s common for certain data, called registry 
entries, to get deleted by mistake or placed in the wrong area. This can cause the 
computer to slow down or even cease working altogether.
Virus – represents a malicious program known as a computer virus, which spreads 
between computers and can delete files, causing a computer to act erratically or 
cease working.
Hacker – represents an unauthorized intruder, known as a hacker, who can sneak 
into your computer and cause havoc such as deleting files or causing your com­
puter to stop working.
Crash – represents a failure that causes a program to act erratically or fail com­
pletely. Although crashes can often be linked to software bugs, computers some­
times crash simply because of unpredictable circumstances that cannot always 
be duplicated.
Trojan Horse – represents a malicious program that tricks you into running and 
installing it on your computer, where it can then delete files or adversely affect 
the performance of a computer.
Appendices

260
Solution Cards
Solution cards are used to eliminate a Problem card that another player places on 
your PC to keep you from successfully booting up. The seven types of Solution 
cards are labeled Patch, Defragmenter, Registry Optimizer, AntiVirus, Firewall, 
Boot Up, and Anti-Spyware.
Each type of Solution card can eliminate one specific Problem card as follows:
Problem card
Solution card
Safety card
Bug
Patch
Cloud Computing
Disk Fragmentation
Defragmenter
UNIX
Registry Failure
Registry Optimizer
UNIX
Virus
AntiVirus
Virtual Machine
Hacker
Firewall
Honeypot
Crash
Boot Up
Cloud Computing
Trojan Horse
Anti-Spyware
Virtual Machine
Patch – represents a software patch or update designed to fix and remove bugs from 
a program.
Defragmenter – represents a special utility program that reorganizes all the files on 
a hard disk so that every file is complete and not broken up into multiple pieces 
within empty gaps between other files.
Registry Optimizer – represents a special utility program designed to fix and repair 
problems with the registry by removing incorrect registry data and either delet­
ing it or placing it in its correct location.
AntiVirus – represents a special utility program designed to identify and remove 
viruses from a computer.
Firewall  – represents a special utility program designed to block unauthorized 
access to a computer through the Internet or over a local area network.
Boot Up – represents the process of either turning on a computer for the first time 
or restarting a computer that is already turned on. Booting up can often clear up 
problems caused by unpredictable program crashes.
Anti-spyware – represents a special utility program that can identify and remove 
malicious programs that can sneak into your computer without your knowledge, 
such as a Trojan Horse.
Safety Cards
Safety cards are used to permanently protect your computer against specific Problem 
cards. The four types of Safety cards are labeled Cloud Computing, UNIX, Virtual 
Machine, and Honeypot.
Cloud Computing – represents the ability to store software on a single computer, 
which allows multiple users to run that single program over the Internet. As a 
Appendices

261
result, individuals no longer need to worry about constantly installing patches or 
dealing with program crashes. The Cloud Computing card protects your com­
puter from the Bug and Crash cards.
UNIX – represents the UNIX operating system, which does not suffer from disk 
fragmentation or registry failures like other operating systems. UNIX deliber­
ately stores files as far apart as possible on a hard disk, which greatly reduces the 
problem of disk fragmentation except when a hard disk is nearly full. UNIX also 
does not rely on a registry, which completely eliminates any possibility of regis­
try problems. The UNIX card protects against the Disk Fragmentation and Reg­
istry Failure cards.
Virtual Machine – represents the ability to run one operating system (known as a 
guest) within another operating system (known as a host). A virtual machine can­
not stop viruses, but they can isolate an operating system to make it difficult for 
viruses to find and infect. In addition, a virtual machine can “clone” an operating 
system so if a virus or Trojan Horse does wreck it, the virtual machine makes it 
easy to delete the file representing the infected operating system and replace it 
with a previous, clean and uninfected version of that same operating system. As 
a result, a virus attack on a virtual machine can be quickly negated within sec­
onds. The Virtual Machine card protects against the Virus and Trojan Horse cards.
Honeypot – represents a special program designed to lure a hacker into a harmless, 
isolated part of a computer that displays fake, but seemingly important data. The 
goal is to trick a hacker away from a legitimate computer that contains important 
data, and trap the hacker into a fake computer where the hacker can do all the 
damage he wants, but the files are fake so nothing will cause problems. The Hon­
eypot card protects against the Hacker card.
Program Cards
Program cards are used to boot up your PC. The five types of Program cards are 
labeled Word Processor, Spreadsheet, Presentation, Web Browser, and E-Mail.
Word Processor – represents a program for creating, editing, and formatting text for 
creating letters or reports.
Spreadsheet – represents a program for performing numeric calculations.
Presentation  – represents a program for organizing and presenting information 
using text and graphics.
Web Browser – represents a program for accessing the Internet.
E-Mail – represents a program for sending and receiving e-mail messages.
Appendices

262
How to Win
Players need to play one of each type of Program cards to win. Players cannot play 
a Program card if they have an unsolved Problem card. Before a player can play a 
Program card, that player must first play a Boot Up card.
The first player to successfully play a Boot Up card and all five Program cards 
while eliminating all Problem cards using a Solution or Safety card is the winner. To 
successfully boot up your computer, you must play all of the following cards:
Boot Up (or Cloud Computing)
Word Processor
Spreadsheet
Presentation
Web Browser
E-Mail
Until you play a Boot Up card for the first time, you cannot play any Program cards. 
The one exception is that you can play a Cloud Computing card instead of a Boot 
Up card.
In addition, you cannot have any unresolved Problem cards such as a Bug or 
Virus card. To eliminate a Problem card, you must either use a Solution card or a 
Safety card. You can only play a Program card as long as you do not have any 
Problem cards played against you.
How to Play
Shuffle the cards and deal six (6) cards to each player. Players may never look at 
another player’s cards. Place the remaining cards face down. This represents the 
Draw Pile.
Determine which player will go first, second, third, etc.
During each player’s turn, a player can do one of the following:
•	 Play a Boot Up (or Cloud Computing) card to start the boot up process of your 
own PC. (You only need to do this once.) Lay the Boot Up card face up in front 
of you to show that your PC is booting up.
•	 Play a Program card to complete the process of booting up your own PC. Lay the 
Program card face up to show which programs your PC has managed to load. 
When you are the first player to have all five different Program cards (Word Pro­
cessor, Spreadsheet, Presentation, E-Mail, and Web Browser) face up in front of 
you, you are the winner.
•	 Play a Problem card to attack another player. (A player who has not played a 
Boot Up card cannot be attacked with a Problem card by other players.) Lay the 
Problem card face up in front of the player you are attacking. That player cannot 
play any Program cards until removing the Problem card with a Solution or 
Safety card.
Appendices

263
•	 Play a Solution or Safety card to eliminate any Problem cards against you. Place 
both the Solution and Problem card face up next to the Draw Pile. These face up 
cards represent the Discard Pile. Once you play a Safety card, you only return the 
Problem card to the Discard Pile but you never return a Safety card to the Dis­
card Pile.
•	 Discard one card.
Each player concludes a turn by drawing a new card from the Draw Pile. Once the 
Draw Pile runs out of cards, reshuffle the Discard Pile and flip it face down to turn 
it into the Draw Pile.
Play continues with each player taking a turn until one player successfully boots 
up a PC by playing a Boot Up, Word Processor, Spreadsheet, Presentation, Web 
Browser, and E-Mail card.
Sample Game Play
Sam and Julie want to play PC Boot Up so they first shuffle the cards, deal each 
player six (6) cards, and place all remaining cards face down to represent the 
Draw Pile.
Turn #1
Same goes first and does not have a Boot Up card. Since Julie has not yet played a 
Boot Up card, Sam cannot play any Problem cards in his hand against her. Sam also 
cannot play any Solution or Safety cards (because there are no Problem cards 
against him).
Sam also cannot play any Program cards until he plays a Boot Up (or Cloud 
Computing) card first. Since there is nothing Sam can do, his only option is to dis­
card a card and draw a new one.
Julie has a Boot Up card so she plays it by placing the Boot Up card face down 
in front of her. Now she draws a new card. At this point, Julie can now be attacked 
by a Problem card and she can also play any Program card.
Turn #2
Because Julie has played a Boot Up card, Sam can now attack her with a Problem 
card, so he places a Virus card in front of Julie. Sam now draws a new card.
Julie does not have an AntiVirus or Virtual Machine card to eliminate the Virus 
card. Julie also cannot attack Sam because he has not played a Boot Up card yet. 
Furthermore, Julie cannot play any Program cards in her hand because a single 
Problem card (the Virus card) has stopped her PC from booting up. Julie’s only 
option is to discard a card and draw a new one.
Appendices

264
Turn #3
Sam plays a Boot Up card and draws a new card. Because he has played a Boot Up 
card for the first time, he can now play Program cards in later turns. Julie can now 
play Problem cards against him.
Julie plays an AntiVirus card to eliminate the Virus card that Sam played against 
her. Both the Virus and AntiVirus cards are placed on the discard pile.
At this point, both Sam and Julie have played a Boot Up card so their PCs have 
started the process of booting up and they can now play Program cards.
Turn #4
Sam plays a Word Processor card and draws a new card. All he needs now is to play 
a Spreadsheet, Presentation, Web Browser, and E-Mail card and he will win.
Julie plays a Hacker card against Sam and draws a new card. At this point, Sam 
cannot play any further Program cards until he can remove the Hacker card by play­
ing a Firewall card (or a Honeypot card). However, Sam can still play any Problem 
cards against Julie.
Turn #5
Sam does not have a Firewall card to eliminate the Hacker card preventing his PC 
from booting up. However, Sam does play a Trojan Horse card against Julie and 
draws a new card.
Julie does not have an Anti-Spyware card to eliminate the Trojan Horse card. 
However, Julie chooses to play a Crash card against Sam and then draws a new card. 
Sam now has a Hacker and a Crash card preventing his PC from booting up. Before 
Sam can play any Program cards, he must remove both the Hacker and Crash card 
using a Firewall and a Boot Up card respectively. There is no limit to the number of 
Problem cards you can play against another player.
Eventually when the Draw Pile runs out of cards, Sam and Julie will shuffle the 
cards, place them face down as the new Draw Pile, and continue playing until one 
of them has finished playing a Word Processor, Spreadsheet, Presentation, Web 
Browser, and E-Mail card without a single Problem card still played against them.
Campaign Game
Normally you can play PC Boot Up as a single game where the first person to suc­
cessfully boot up is the winner. However, you can also play PC Boot Up as an 
extended campaign game where each player earns points and the first player to 
reach 1,000 points is the winner.
Appendices

265
When playing multiple games, award points to all players as follows:
•	 100 points to the winner
•	 25 points for each Program card played
•	 10 points for each Safety card played in response to an opponent playing a Prob­
lem card against you. (You do not get any points for holding an unplayed Safety 
card, nor do you get points for playing a Safety card before an opponent has 
played a Problem card against you.)
•	 50 extra points if you boot up your computer and win before your opponent has 
even played one Program card
If a player wins, that player will always earn a minimum of 100 points for winning 
plus an additional 125 points for each Program card (5 Program cards * 25 points) 
played for a total of 225 points.
