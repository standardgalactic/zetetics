Abstract
Visual dialog (VisDial) is a task which re-
quires a dialog agent to answer a series of
questions grounded in an image. Unlike in vi-
sual question answering (VQA), the series of
questions should be able to capture a tempo-
ral context from a dialog history and utilizes
visually-grounded information. Visual refer-
ence resolution is a problem that addresses
these challenges, requiring the agent to resolve
ambiguous references in a given question and
to ﬁnd the references in a given image.
In
this paper, we propose Dual Attention Net-
works (DAN) for visual reference resolution
in VisDial. DAN consists of two kinds of at-
tention modules, REFER and FIND. Specif-
ically, REFER module learns latent relation-
ships between a given question and a dia-
log history by employing a multi-head atten-
tion mechanism. FIND module takes image
features and reference-aware representations
(i.e., the output of REFER module) as input,
and performs visual grounding via bottom-up
attention mechanism.
We qualitatively and
quantitatively evaluate our model on VisDial
v1.0 and v0.9 datasets, showing that DAN out-
performs the previous state-of-the-art model
by a signiﬁcant margin.

Introduction
Thanks to the recent progresses in natural lan-
guage processing and computer vision, there has
been an extensive amount of effort towards devel-
oping a cognitive agent that jointly understand nat-
ural language and vision information. Over the
last few years, vision-language tasks such as im-
age captioning (Xu et al., 2015) and visual ques-
tion answering (VQA) (Antol et al., 2015; Ander-
son et al., 2018) have provided a testbed for devel-
oping a cognitive agent. However, the agent per-
forming these tasks still has a long way to go to
be used in real-world applications (e.g., aiding vi-
sually impaired users, interacting with humanoid
robots) in that it does not consider the continuous
interaction over time. Speciﬁcally, the interaction
in image captioning is that the agent simply talks
to human about visual content, without any input
from human. While the VQA agent takes a ques-
tion as input, it is required to answer a single ques-
tion about a given image.
Visual dialog (VisDial) (Das et al., 2017) task
has been introduced as a generalized version of
VQA. A dialog agent needs to answer a series of
questions such as “How many people are in the
image?”, “Are they indoors or outside?”, utilizing
not only visually-grounded information but also
contextual information from a dialog history. To
address these two challenges, researchers have re-
cently tackled a problem called visual reference
resolution in VisDial. The problem of visual ref-
erence resolution is to resolve ambiguous expres-
sions on their own (e.g., it, they, any other) and
ground them to a given image.
In this paper, we address the visual reference
resolution in a visual dialog task.
We ﬁrst hy-
pothesize that humans address the visual refer-
ence resolution through a two-step process: (1)
linguistically resolve the ambiguous questions by
recalling the dialog history from one’s memory
and (2) ﬁnd a local region of a given image for
the resolved questions. For example, as shown in
Figure 1, the question “Does it look like a nice
one?” is ambiguous on its own because we do not
know what “it” refers to. So we believe that hu-
mans try to recall the dialog history and implic-
itly ﬁnd out “it” refers to the “skateboard”. After
the resolution step, we believe that they will ﬁ-
nally try to ﬁnd the skateboard in the image and
answer the question.
For these processes, we
propose Dual Attention Networks (DAN) which
consists of two kinds of attention modules, RE-
FER and FIND. REFER module learns to retrieve
the relevant previous dialogs for clarifying am-

Figure 1: An overview of Dual Attention Networks (DAN). We propose two kinds of attention modules, REFER
and FIND. REFER learns latent relationships between a given question and a dialog history to retrieve the relevant
previous dialogs. FIND performs visual grounding, taking image features and reference-aware representations (i.e.,
the output of REFER). ⊗, ⊕, and ⊙denote matrix multiplication, concatenation and element-wise multiplication,
respectively. The multi-layer perceptron is omitted in this ﬁgure for simplicity.
biguous questions. Inspired by the self-attention
mechanism (Vaswani et al., 2017), REFER mod-
ule computes multi-head attention over all previ-
ous dialogs in a sentence-level fashion, followed
by feed-forward networks to get the reference-
aware representations. FIND module takes image
features and the reference-aware representations,
and performs visual grounding via bottom-up at-
tention mechanism. From this pipeline, we expect
our proposed model to be capable of question dis-
ambiguation by using REFER module and ground
the resolved reference properly to the given image.
The main contributions of this paper are as fol-
lows. First, we propose Dual Attention Networks
(DAN) for visual reference resolution in visual di-
alog based on REFER and FIND modules. Sec-
ond, we validate our proposed model on the large-
scale datasets: VisDial v1.0 and v0.9. Our model
achieves a new state-of-the-art results compared to
other methods. We also conduct ablation studies
by four criteria to demonstrate the effectiveness of
our proposed components. Third, we make a com-
parison between DAN and our baseline model to
demonstrate the performance improvements on se-
mantically incomplete questions needed to be clar-
iﬁed. Finally, we perform qualitative analysis of
our model, showing that DAN reasonably attends
to the dialog history and salient image regions.

Related Work
Visual Dialog.
Visual dialog (VisDial) task was
recently proposed by (Das et al., 2017), provid-
ing a testbed for research on the interplay be-
tween computer vision and dialog systems. Ac-
cordingly, a dialog agent performing this task is
not only required to ﬁnd visual groundings of
linguistic expressions but also capture semantic
nuances from human conversation.
Attention-
based approaches were primarily proposed to ad-
dress these challenges, including memory net-
works (Das et al., 2017), history-conditioned im-
age attentive encoder (Lu et al., 2017), sequential
co-attention (Wu et al., 2018), and synergistic co-
attention networks (Guo et al., 2019).
Visual Reference Resolution.
Recently,
re-
searchers have tackled a problem called visual ref-
erence resolution (Seo et al., 2017; Kottur et al.,
2018; Niu et al., 2018) in VisDial. To resolve vi-
sual references, (Seo et al., 2017) proposed an at-
tention memory which stores a sequence of previ-
ous visual attention maps in memory slots. They
retrieved the previous visual attention maps by ap-
plying a soft attention over all the memory slots
and combined it with a current visual attention.

Furthermore, (Kottur et al., 2018) attempted to re-
solve visual references at a word-level, relying on
an off-the-shelf parser.
Similar to the attention
memory (Seo et al., 2017), they proposed a ref-
erence pool which stores visual attention maps of
recognized entities and retrieved the weighted sum
of the visual attention maps by applying a soft at-
tention. (Niu et al., 2018) proposed a recursive
visual attention model that recursively reviews the
previous dialogs and reﬁnes the current visual at-
tention. The recursion is continued until the ques-
tion itself is determined to be unambiguous. A bi-
nary decision whether the questions is ambiguous
or not is made by Gumbel-Softmax approximation
(Jang et al., 2016; Maddison et al., 2016). To re-
solve the visual references, above approaches at-
tempted to retrieve the visual attention of the pre-
vious dialogs, and applied it on the current visual
attention.
These approaches have limitations in
that they store all previous visual attentions, while
researches in human memory system show that
the visual sensory-memory, due to its rapid decay
property, hardly stores all previous visual atten-
tions (Sperling, 1960; Sergent et al., 2011). Based
on this biologically inspired motivation, our pro-
posed model calculates the current visual attention
by using linguistic cues (i.e., dialog history).
3
Proposed Algorithm
In this section, we formally describe the visual di-
alog task and our proposed algorithm, Dual Atten-
tion Networks (DAN). The visual dialog task (Das
et al., 2017) is deﬁned as follows. A dialog agent
is given an input such as an image I, a follow-up
question at round t as Qt, and a dialog history (in-
cluding the image caption) until round t −1,
H = ( C
|{z}
H0
, (Q1, Agt
1 )
|
{z
}
H1
, · · · , (Qt−1, Agt
t−1)
|
{z
}
Ht−1
).
Agt
t denotes the ground truth answer (i.e., human
response) at round t. By using these inputs, the
agent is asked to rank a list of 100 candidate an-
swers, At =

A1
t , · · · , A100
t
	
.
Given the problem setup, DAN for visual dia-
log task can be framed as an encoder-decoder ar-
chitecture: (1) an encoder that jointly embeds the
input (I, Qt, H) and (2) a decoder that converts the
embedded representation into the ranked list ˆ
At.
From this point of view, DAN consists of three
components which are REFER, FIND, and the an-
swer decoder. As shown in Figure 1, REFER mod-
ule learns to attend relevant previous dialogs to re-
solve the ambiguous references in a given question
Qt. FIND module learns to attend to the spatial
image features that the output of REFER module
describes. Answer decoder ranks the list of candi-
date answers At given the output of FIND module.
We ﬁrst introduce the language features, as well
as the image features in Sec. 3.1. Then we de-
scribe the detailed architectures of the REFER and
FIND modules in Sec. 3.2 and 3.3, respectively.
Finally, we present the answer decoder in Sec. 3.4.
3.1
Input Representation
Language Features.
We ﬁrst embed each word
in the follow-up question Qt to {wt,1, · · · , wt,T }
by using pre-trained GloVe (Pennington et al.,
2014) embeddings, where T denotes the num-
ber of tokens in Qt.
We then use a two-layer
LSTM, generating a sequence of hidden states
{ut,1, · · · , ut,T }. Note that we use the last hidden
state of the LSTM ut,T as a question feature, de-
noted as qt ∈RL.
ut,i = LSTM(wt,i, ut,i−1)
(1)
qt = ut,T
(2)
Also, each element in the dialog history {Hi}t−1
i=0
and the candidate answers

Ai
t
	100
i=1 are embed-
ded as the follow-up question, yielding {hi}t−1
i=0 ∈
Rt×L and

oi
t
	100
i=1 ∈R100×L. Qt, H, and At are
embedded with same word embedding vector and
three different LSTMs.
Image Features.
Inspired by bottom-up atten-
tion (Anderson et al., 2018), we use the Faster
R-CNN (Ren et al., 2015) pre-trained with Vi-
sual Genome (Krishna et al., 2017) to extract the
object-level image features. We denote the output
features as v ∈RK×V , where K and V are the total
number of object detection features per image and
dimension of the each feature, respectively. We
adaptively extract the number of object features K
ranging from 10 to 100 for reﬂecting the complex-
ity of each image. K is ﬁxed during training.
3.2
REFER Module
In this section, we formally describe the single-
layer REFER module. Given the question and di-
alog history features, REFER module aims to at-
tend to the most relevant elements of dialog his-
tory with respect to the given question. Speciﬁ-
cally, we ﬁrst compute scaled dot product atten-
tion (Vaswani et al., 2017) in multi-head settings

Figure 2: Illustration of the single-layer REFER module. REFER module focuses on the latent relationship be-
tween the follow-up question and a dialog history to resolve ambiguous references in the question. We employ two
submodule: multi-head attention and feed-forward networks. Multi-head attention computes the h number of soft
attentions over all elements of dialog history by using scaled dot product attention. Then, it returns the h number
of heads which are weighted by the attentions. Followed by the two-layer feed-forward networks, REFER module
ﬁnally returns the reference-aware representations eref

. ⊕and Dotted line denote the concatenation operation and
linear projection operation by the learnable matrices, respectively.
which are called multi-head attention. Let qt and
Mt = {hi}t−1
i=0 be the question and dialog history
feature vectors, respectively. qt and Mt are pro-
jected to dref dimensions by different and learn-
able projection matrices.
We then conduct dot
product of these two projected matrices, divide by
pdref, and apply the softmax function to obtain
the attention weights on the all elements in the di-
alog history. It is formulated as below,
headn = Attention(qtW q
n, MtW m
n )
(3)
Attention(a, b) = softmax( ab⊤
pdref
)b
(4)
where W q
n
∈RL×dref and W m
n
∈RL×dref .
Note that dot product attention is computed h
times with different projection matrices, yield-
ing {headn}h
n=1.
Accordingly, we can get the
multi-head representations xt, concatenating all
{headn}h
n=1, followed by linear projection. Also,
we can compute ˆxt by applying a residual connec-
tion (He et al., 2016), followed by layer normal-
ization (Ba et al., 2016).
xt = (head1 ⊕· · · ⊕headh) W o
(5)
ˆxt = LayerNorm(xt + qt)
(6)
where ⊕denotes the concatenation operation, and
W o ∈Rhdref×L is the projection matrix. Next,
we apply ˆxt to two-layer feed-forward networks
with a ReLU in between, where W f
1 ∈RL×2L and
W f
2 ∈R2L×L. The residual connection and layer
normalization is also applied in this step.
ct = ReLU(ˆxtW f
1 + bf
1)W f
2 + bf
2
(7)
ˆct = LayerNorm(ct + ˆxt)
(8)
eref
t
= ˆct ⊕qt
(9)
Finally, REFER module returns the reference-
aware representations by concatenating the con-
textual representation ˆct and the original question
representation qt, denoted as eref
t
∈R2L. In this
work, we use dref = 256. Figure 2 illustrates the
pipeline of the REFER module.
Furthermore, we stack the REFER modules in
multiple layers to get a high-level abstraction of
the reference-aware representations. Details are to
be discussed in Sec. 4.5.
3.3
FIND Module
Instead of relying on the visual attention maps of
the previous dialogs as in (Seo et al., 2017; Kottur
et al., 2018; Niu et al., 2018), we expect the FIND
module to attend to the most relevant regions of
the image with respect to the reference-aware
representations (i.e., the output of REFER mod-
ule). In order to implement the visual grounding
for the reference-aware representations, we take
inspiration from bottom-up attention mechanism
(Anderson et al., 2018).
Let v ∈RK×V and
eref
t
∈R2L be the image feature vectors and
reference-aware representations, respectively. We
ﬁrst project these two vectors to dfind dimensions
and compute soft attention over all the object
detection features as follows:

rt = fv(v) ⊙fref(eref
t
)
(10)
αt = softmax(rtW r + br)
(11)
where fv(·) and fref(·) denote the two-layer
multi-layer perceptrons which convert to dfind
dimensions, and W r ∈Rdfind×1 is the projec-
tion matrix for the softmax activation. ⊙denotes
hadamard product (i.e., element-wise multiplica-
tion). From these equations, we can get the vi-
sual attention weights αt ∈RK×1. Next, we apply
the visual attention weights to v and compute the
vision-language joint representations as follows:
ˆvt =
K
X
j=1
αt,jvj
(12)
zt = f′
v(ˆvt) ⊙f′
ref(eref
t
)
(13)
efind
t
= ztW z + bz
(14)
where f′
v(·) and f′
ref(·) also denote the two-layer
multi-layer perceptrons which convert to dfind di-
mensions, and W z ∈Rdfind×L is the projection
matrix. Note that efind
t
∈RL is the output repre-
sentations of the encoder as well as FIND module
which is decoded to score the list of candidate an-
swers. In this work, we use dfind = 1024.
3.4
Answer Decoder
Answer decoder computes each score of candidate
answers via a dot product with the embedded rep-
resentation efind
t
, followed by a softmax activa-
tion to get a categorical distribution over the can-
didates. Let Ot =

oi
t
	100
i=1 ∈R100×L be the feature
vectors of 100 candidate answers. The distribution
pt is formulated as follows:
pt = softmax(efind
t
Ot⊤)
(15)
In training phase, DAN is optimized by minimiz-
ing the cross-entropy loss between the one-hot en-
coded label vector (i.e., yt) and probability distri-
bution (i.e., pt).
L(θ) = −
X
k
yt,k log pt,k
(16)
Where pt,k denotes the probability of the k-th can-
didate answer at round t. In test phase, the list of
candidate answers is ranked by the distribution pt,
and evaluated by the given metrics.

Experiments
In this section, we describe the details of our ex-
periments on the VisDial v1.0 and v0.9 datasets.
We ﬁrst introduce the VisDial datasets, evaluation
metrics, and implementation details in Sec. 4.1,
Sec. 4.2, and Sec. 4.3, respectively. Then we re-
port the quantitative results by comparing our pro-
posed model with the state-of-the-art approaches
and baseline model in Sec. 4.4. Then, we conduct
the ablation studies by four criteria to report the
relative contributions of each components in Sec.
4.5. Finally, we provide the qualitative results in
Sec. 4.6.
4.1
Datasets
We evaluate our proposed model on the VisDial
v0.9 and v1.0 dataset. VisDial v0.9 dataset (Das
et al., 2017) has been collected from two anno-
tators chatting log about MS-COCO (Lin et al.,
2014) images. Each dialog is made up of an im-
age, a caption from MS-COCO dataset and 10
QA pairs. As a result, VisDial v0.9 dataset con-
tains 83k dialogs and 40k dialogs as train and
validation splits, respectively. Recently, VisDial
v1.0 dataset (Das et al., 2017) has been released
with an additional 10k COCO-like images from
Flickr.
Dialogs for the additional images have
been collected similar to v0.9. Overall, VisDial
v1.0 dataset contains 123k (all dialogs from v0.9),
2k, and 8k dialogs as train, validation, and test
splits, respectively.
4.2
Evaluation Metrics
We evaluate individual responses at each ques-
tion in a retrieval setting according to (Das et al.,
2017).
Speciﬁcally, the dialog agent is given a
list of 100 candidate answers of each question and
asked to rank the list. There are three kinds of
evaluation metrics for retrieval performance: (1)
mean rank of human response, (2) recall@k (i.e.,
existence of the human response in top-k ranked
response), and (3) mean reciprocal rank (MRR).
Mean rank, recall@k, and MRR are highly corre-
lated with the rank of human response. In addi-
tion, (Das et al., 2017) proposed to use the robust
evaluation metric, normalized discounted cumula-
tive gain (NDCG). NDCG takes into account all
relevant answers from the ranked list, where the
relevance scores are densely annotated for VisDial
v1.0 test split. NDCG penalizes the lower rank of
the candidate answers with high relevance scores.

Implementation Details
The dimension of image features V and hidden
states in all LSTM L is 2048 and 512, respectively.
All the language intputs are embedded into a 300-
dimensional vector initialized by GloVe (Penning-
ton et al., 2014). The number of attention heads
h is ﬁxed to 4 except for the ablation study that
changes it. We apply Adam optimizer (Kingma
and Ba, 2014) with learning rate 1 ×10−3, de-
creased by 1 ×10−4 per epoch until epoch 7, de-
cayed by 0.5 per epoch from 8 to 12 epochs.

Quantitative Results
Compared Methods.
We compare our pro-
posed model with the state-of-the-art approaches
on VisDial v1.0 and v0.9 datasets, which can be
categorized into three groups: (1) Fusion-based
approaches (LF and HRE (Das et al., 2017)),
(2) Attention-based approaches (MN (Das et al.,
2017), HCIAE (Lu et al., 2017), CoAtt (Wu et al.,
2018) and Synergistic (Guo et al., 2019)), and (3)
Approaches that deal with visual reference res-
olution in VisDial (AMEM (Seo et al., 2017),
CorefNMN (Kottur et al., 2018) and RvA (Niu
et al., 2018)). Our proposed model belongs to the
third category.
Results on VisDial v1.0 and v0.9 datasets.

shown in Table 1, DAN signiﬁcantly outperforms
all other approaches on NDCG, MRR, and R@1,
including the previous state-of-the-art method,
Synergistic (Guo et al., 2019). Speciﬁcally, DAN
improves approximately 1.0% on MRR, 1.7% on
R@1 and 0.3% on NDCG in VisDial v1.0 dataset.

the candidate answers. In Table 2, our model sig-

her) as the semantically incomplete (SI) ques-
tions. Also, we can declare the questions that do
not have pronouns as semantically complete (SC)
questions. Then, we have checked the contribu-
tion of the reference-aware representations for the
SC and SI questions, respectively.
Speciﬁcally,
we make a comparison between DAN, which uti-
lizes reference-aware representations (i.e., eref
t
),
and No REFER, which exploits question repre-
sentations (i.e., qt) only. From the Table 3, we
draw three observations: (1) DAN shows signif-
icantly better results than the No REFER model
for SC questions. It validates that the context from
dialog history enriches the question information,
even when the question is semantically complete.
(2) SI questions obtain more beneﬁts from the di-
alog history than SC questions. It indicates that
DAN is more robust to the SI questions than SC
questions. (3) A dialog agent faces greater difﬁ-
culty in answering SI questions compared to SC
questions. No REFER is equivalent to the FIND +
RPN model in the ablation study section.

Ablation Study
In this section, we perform ablation study on Vis-
Dial v1.0 validation split with the following four
model variants: (1) Model only using the single
attention module, (2) Model that uses different
image features (pre-trained VGG-16 is used), (3)
Model that does not use the residual connection in
REFER module, and (4) Model that stacks the RE-
FER modules up to four layers with each different
number of attention heads.
Single Module.
The ﬁrst four rows in Table 4
show the performance of a single module. FIND
denotes the use of FIND module only, and RE-
FER denotes the use of single-layer REFER mod-
ule only.
Speciﬁcally, REFER uses the output
of REFER module as the encoder outputs.

the other hand, FIND does not take the reference-
aware representations (i.e., eref
t
) but the question
feature (i.e., qt).
The single models show rela-
tively poor performance compared with the dual
module model. We believe that the results val-
idate two hypotheses: (1) VisDial task requires
contextual information from dialog history as well
as the visually-grounded information. (2) REFER
and FIND modules have complementary modeling
abilities.
Image Features in FIND Module.
To report the
impact of image features, we replace the bottom-
up attention features (Anderson et al., 2018) with
ImageNet pre-trained VGG-16 (Simonyan and
Zisserman, 2014) features. In detail, we use the
output of the VGG-16 pool5 layer as image fea-
tures. In Table 4, RPN denotes the use of the re-
gion proposal networks (Ren et al., 2015) which
are equivalent to the use of bottom-up attention
features. Similar to VQA task, we observe that
DAN with bottom-up attention features achieves

Figure 4: Qualitative results on the VisDial v1.0 dataset. We visualize the attention over dialog history from
REFER module and the visual attention from FIND module. The object detection features with top ﬁve attention
weights are marked with colored box. A red colored box indicates the most salient visual feature. Also, the
attention from REFER module is represented as shading, darker shading indicates the larger attention weight for
each element of the dialog history. Our proposed model not only responds to the correct answer, but also selectively
pays attention to the previous dialogs and salient image regions.
better performance than with VGG-16 features. In
other words, the use of object-level features boosts
the MRR performance of DAN.
Residual Connection in REFER Module.
We
also conduct an ablation study to investigate the
effectiveness of the residual connection in REFER
module. As shown in Table 4, the use of the resid-
ual connection (i.e., Res) boosts the MRR score of
DAN. In other words, DAN utilizes the excellence
of deep residual learning as in (He et al., 2016;
Rockt¨aschel et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2016; Kim
et al., 2016; Vaswani et al., 2017).
Stack of REFER Modules & Attention Heads.
We stack the REFER modules up to four layers
with each different number of attention heads, h ∈
{1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64}. In other words, we conduct
the ablation experiments with twenty-eight mod-
els to set the hyperparameters of our model. Fig-
ure 3 shows the results of the ablation experiments.
For n ≥2, REFER (n) indicates that DAN uses a
stack of n identical REFER modules. Speciﬁcally,
for each pair of successive modules, the output of
the previous REFER module is fed into the next
REFER module as a query (i.e., qt). Due to the
small number of elements in each dialog history,
the overall performance pattern shows a tendency
to decrease as the number of attention heads in-
creases.
It turns out that the two-layer REFER
module with four attention heads (i.e., REFER (2)
and h = 4) performs the best among all models in
ablation study, recording 64.17% on MRR.

Qualitative Results
In this section, we visualize the inference mecha-
nism of our proposed model. Figure 4 shows the
qualitative results of DAN. Given a question that is
needed to be clariﬁed, DAN correctly answers the
question by selectively attending to each element
of the dialog history and salient image regions. In
case of the visual attention, we mark the object
detection features with top ﬁve attention weights
of each image. On the other hand, the attention
weights from REFER module are represented as
shading; darker shading indicates the larger atten-
tion weight for each element of the dialog history.
These attention weights are calculated by averag-
ing over all the attention heads.

Conclusion
We introduce Dual Attention Networks (DAN) for
visual reference resolution in visual dialog task.
DAN explicitly divides the visual reference res-
olution problem into a two-step process. Rather
than relying on the previous visual attention maps
as in prior works, DAN ﬁrst linguistically resolves

ambiguous references in a given question by us-
ing REFER module. Then, it grounds the resolved
references in the image by using FIND module.
We empirically validate our proposed model on
VisDial v1.0 and v0.9 datasets.
DAN achieves
the new state-of-the-art performance, while being
simpler and more grounded.
