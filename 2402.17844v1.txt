One of the obstacles to reconciling quantum theory with general relativity, is constructing a theory
which is both consistent with observation, and and gives finite answers at high energy, so that the
theory holds at arbitrarily short distances. Quantum field theory achieves this through the process
of renormalisation, but famously, perturbative quantum gravity fails to be renormalisable. Recently,
an alternative to quantum gravity has been proposed, in which the geometry of spacetime is taken to
be classical rather than quantum, while still being coupled to quantum matter fields [1, 2]. This can
be done consistently, provided that the dynamics is fundamentally stochastic. Here, we show that
this theory is renormalisable in the gravitational degrees of freedom. We do so via the path integral
formulation by relating the classical-quantum action to that of quadratic gravity. Because the action
induces stochastic dynamics of spacetime, rather than deterministic evolution of a quantum field,
the theory is able to remain renormalisable, while being free of tachyons and negative norm ghosts.
The scale invariant and asymptotically free theory appears to be favoured through considerations
of complete positivity. The results presented here have a number of implications for inflation, CMB
data, and experiments to test the quantum nature of spacetime.
They also point to a possible
resolution of the black hole singularity.

INTRODUCTION
In Einstein’s theory of general relativity, matter causes spacetime to curve, via
Gµν + Λgµν = 8πGN
c4
T µν
(1)
where the left-hand side encodes the spacetime degrees of freedom via the Einstein tensor Gµν, and on the right-hand
side sits the energy-momentum tensor T µν encoding the matter degrees of freedom. Since matter has a quantum
nature, the right-hand side of Equation (1) must become an operator ˆT µν, according to quantum theory (we will
henceforth denote quantum operators by placing aˆon them, and use units where ℏ= c = 1). Consistency would
then appear to require that the Einstein tensor become an operator as well, and there has been virtual unanimity in
pursuing this approach of quantising gravity. However, the initial difficulty with constructing a quantum theory of
gravity, arose because perturbative quantum gravity fails to be renormalisable. Over-coming this issue is one of the
central challenges in reconciling quantum theory with gravity. Loop quantum gravity [3–6] achieves UV-finiteness,
because the spin-foam network degrees of freedom essentially live on a lattice, which introduces a cut-off related to
the spacing of the lattice. String theory [7–10] is believed to be UV-finite, and this has been demonstrated up to
some order in the early teens in perturbation theory. The asymptotic safety program [11] assumes a renormalisable
theory of quantum gravity, and derives some of the consequences. The full Lagrangian is not known but some simple
examples of Lagrangians illustrate the principle.
Alternatively, instead of quantising gravity as has been achieved for the other fields, we can ask whether spacetime
should remain classical. This is motivated by the fact that the spacetime metric plays a very different role in quantum
theory in comparison with other fields. It provides a background causal structure, and notion of time in which the
other fields evolve. It is thus reasonable to have lingering questions about whether quantising the metric is appropriate.
Only gravity, amongst all the forces, can be described in terms of a universal background geometry. However, for
much of the history of this debate, the only theory in which gravity remains classical, was the semi-classical Einstein’s
equation, where one replaces the quantum stress-energy tensor of matter (an operator), by its expectation value [12–
14]. Treating such an equation as fundamental has long been known to be pathological since it is nonlinear in the
density matrix, and leads to super-luminal signalling [15–17] or a breakdown of the statistical interpretation of the
density matrix [18]. It is thus not surprising that equating a classical metric with semi-classical gravity, has led to
the rejection of such a possibility [19–22].
However, there are consistent ways to couple classical and quantum systems via a master-equation approach [1, 23–
27], and via a measurement and feedback approach in the case of sourcing the Newtonian potential by quantum
matter [28–30].
One can derive the most general form of consistent classical-quantum dynamics, by demanding
that the dynamics preserves the split of classical and quantum degrees of freedom, and preserve the positivity and
normalisation of probabilities [1, 27]. This can then be used to construct a consistent master equation for general
relativity via the Hamiltonian formulation [1, 31]. Recently a path integral formulation of classical-quantum dynamics
was introduced with Zach Weller-Davies [32] and used to formulate a manifestly covariant path integral for classical
general relativity coupled to quantum fields [2].
Given the existence of a consistent theory of gravity and quantum field theory, we now ask whether the theory
is renormalisable. Renormalisability is especially important for a theory which is motivated by the perspective that
gravity is different from the other forces because it describes the geometry of spacetime. If that’s the case, we’d
expect gravity to be described in terms of the spacetime metric, up to the smallest distance scales. We are therefor
most interested in whether the theory of [1, 2] is renormalisable in the gravitational degrees of freedom, which is the
question we will address here. We shall find that this is the case via the path integral formulation of [2], demonstrating
that the theory is not only a manifestly diffeomorphism invariant and consistent theory of general relativity coupled
to quantum fields, but that it is also renormalisable in the gravitational degrees of freedom.
We will show that the theory is renormalisable, by relating the path integral of
[2] to that of quadratic grav-
ity [33–36]. Quadratic gravity is considered an interesting alternative to general relativity, precisely because it is
renormalisable [33]. However, the theory suffers from tachyons or ghosts
[33, 35, 37]. The issue of ghosts is that
the Hamiltonian is unbounded from below, leading to the theory being unstable. Alternatively, this is equivalent
to negative norm states. In fact, for renormalizability, we must trade negative energies for negative norms. There
have been attempts to resolve this, this [36, 38–42], for example by finding that there are meta-stable states in the
theory [43]. Here we will see that while the theory of [1, 2] retains the renormalisability properties of quadratic
gravity, it doesn’t suffer from tachyons or ghosts precisely because it describes a stochastic classical theory, rather
than a unitary quantum theory of gravity. After explaining this, we next compute the propagator of the theory, which

3
is here interpreted as a correlation kernel. In the appendix, we also include the full equations of motion, which are
both different to those of quadratic gravity when it comes to their matter coupling but also have a very different
interpretation. They are not deterministic equations of motion, but rather, are termed most probable paths, which
we will shortly explain. The Appendix also contains an explanation of how the path integral can be gauge fixed in
Section C, to ensure that the path integral is a genuine sum over geometries.
II.
THE CLASSICAL-QUANTUM FORMALISM
Let us first briefly review the classical-quantum path integral formalism [32] and the path integral for gravity given
in [2]. A classical quantum (CQ) system is represented by a point in phase-space or configuration space {q, ˙q}, and
conditional on the classical system being at that point in configuration space, a density matrix living in a Hilbert
space H. Since we will need to allow for probability distributions over the classical degrees of freedom, a classical-
quantum state associates to each classical variable an un-normalized density matrix ϱ(q, ˙q, t) = p(q, ˙q, t)ˆσ(q, ˙q, t)
such that TrH
 ϱ(q, ˙q)

= p(q, ˙q, t) ≥0 is a normalized probability density over the classical degrees of freedom and
R
dq ϱ(q, ˙q, t) is a normalized density operator in the Hilbert space. Intuitively, p(q, ˙q, t) can be understood as the
probability density of being at a point q, ˙q and ˆσ(q, ˙q, t) as the normalized quantum state, given the classical state
q, ˙q occurs. The dynamics is then consistent, provided it preserves the state space, even when acting on only part
of a system, it must map a CQ-state to another CQ-state. This ensures that the classical and quantum degrees of
freedom remain classical and quantum respectively. Since the CQ state is positive and normalised, the dynamics must
be a completely positive, norm preserving (CPTP) map. The general form of dynamics possessing this property were
given in [1, 27] in the master equation picture, and in [44] in the trajectories picture. In the case of path integrals,
a sufficient condition for consistent dynamics was given in [2], and we here consider a path integral which is of this
form. The CQ path integral is related to the Feynman-Vernon path integral for open quantum systems [45], and the
Onsager-Machlup path integral [46] which appears in the context of stochastic classical dynamics. A table comparing
the classical-quantum path integral with these two forms can be found in Appendix A.
In order to describe the state of the quantum fields ϕ in terms of a density matrix, we formally imagine doubling
the number of fields, calling them ϕ+ and ϕ−to represent the bra and ket field respectively, as is done in the
Schwinger-Keldish or Feynman-Vernon [45] formalism. We can the write the CQ-state as
ϱ(q, ˙q, t) =
Z
dϕ+dϕ−ϱ(q, ˙q, ϕ+, ϕ−, t) |ϕ+⟩⟨ϕ−|,
(2)
with ϱ(q, ϕ+, ϕ−, t) = ⟨ϕ+|ρ(q, t)|ϕ−⟩being the components of the CQ state. In order for the CQ-state to give positive
and normalised probabilities of measurement results, ϱ(q, ˙q, ϕ+, ϕ−, t) must be positive semi-definite at all points in
configuration space, and normalised
Z
dq Tr(ϱ(q, ˙q, t)) = 1.
(3)
The CQ path integral can then be used to tell us how the components of the density matrix evolve.
ρ(qf, ˙qf, ϕ+, ϕ−, tf) =
Z
DqDϕ+Dϕ−1
N eICQ[q, ˙q,ϕ+,ϕ−,ti,tf ]ρ(qi, ˙qi, ϕ+
i , ϕ−
i , ti).
(4)
In Equation (4) it is implicitly understood that boundary conditions are to be imposed at tf, and we have included
a normalization factor N which can depend on the classical degree of freedom [47]. ICQ is the CQ-action [32] which
for the purposes of the present work, will be given by
ICQ = iSQ[q, ϕ+] −iSQ[q, ϕ−] + iSF V [q, ϕ+, ϕ−] + Sdiff[q, ϕ+, ϕ−],
(5)
where iSQ[q, ϕ±] are the usual actions for the quantum system which induce unitary evolution on the bra and ket
fields ϕ± respectively. There could be a dependence on the classical degrees of freedom q, for example through an
interaction term, which describes how the classical system influences the quantum system. iSF V [q, ϕ+, ϕ−] is known
as the Feynman-Vernon action. It couples the bra and ket field, which act to decohere the quantum system, and could

4
depend on the classical degrees of freedom, depending on the form of the interaction. A simple example is
iSF V [ϕ+, ϕ−] = −D0
2
Z
dx (ϕ+ −ϕ−)2,
(6)
which will cause off-diagonal elements of the density matrix to decay exponentially. The dynamics of the classical
degrees of freedom is contained in Sdiff[q, ϕ+, ϕ−], which encodes the backreaction of the quantum system on the
classical degrees of freedom through a classical-quantum version of the Onsager-Machlup [46] functional. In other
words, the classical system diffuses stochastically around its deterministic equations of motion, sourced by the quantum
degrees of freedom. For example [2],
Sdiff[q, ϕ+, ϕ−] = −1

induces a stochastic force on the classical field q(x), by an amount determined by the average of the bra and ket fields
at some point x, and whose variance is determined by the constant D2. The constant D1 determines the strength of
the back-reaction. Note that this looks like an equation of motion squared. This action, therefore suppresses paths
which deviate too far from the equation of motion 2q = D1

which is the path integral for stochastic fluctuations around the force F. In the case of more degrees of freedom qi

is required to be a positive semidefinite matrix. Note again, that the
Onsager-Machlup (OM) function is essentially an Euler-Lagrange equation squared. The phase-space version of the
OM path integral is related to the path integral of Martin-Siggia-Rose [48].
When 4D2 = D1D−1
0 D1 in the CQ path integral, the dynamics can be shown to be completely positive and norm
preserving [2], and the quantum state remains pure, conditioned on the classical degrees of freedom [44]. This condition
saturates an inequality known as the decoherence vs diffusion trade-off [49]. One typically also includes source terms
in the action, in order to compute correlation functions, but we shall omit these here for the sake of simplicity.

FROM THE CLASSICAL-QUANTUM PATH INTEGRAL TO QUADRATIC GRAVITY

in [2] with an action

(9)
where LQ is the standard Lagrangian density for the quantum fields, T µν± are the stress-energy tensor for the ϕ±
fields, Gµν is the Einstein tensor formed from the metric gµν in d spacetime dimensions, g is the determinant of the
metric, Λ is a constant, GN is Newton’s constant and dx is taken to mean integration over d spacetime dimensions.
The bottom term is similar to the ”equation of motion squared term” such as that of Eq. (7). If D0,µνρσ is positive
definite, then paths which violate Einstein’s equation sourced by the average stress-energy tensor over the bra and
ket fields, are suppressed.
The third term is a Feynman-Vernon term which decoheres the field in terms of the
stress-energy tensor.
However, there is an apparent tension if one wants to recover all of Einstein’s equations in the classical limit. Namely,
if we want the action to be manifestly diffeomorphism invariant, then D0,µνρσ should be constructed from the metric.
As noted in [2], if D0,µνρσ = D0(−g)−1/2gµνgρσ with D0 a positive constant, geometries which deviate too far from
satisfying the trace of Einstein’s equations are suppressed. This allows one to construct a diffeomorphism-invariant
and self-consistent theory of classical-quantum Nordstrom gravity [50] but whether one can recover the remainder of

5
Einstein’s equations has been an open question. The other suggestion in [2] was for D0 to be given by the generalised
deWitt metric parameterised by β
D0,µνρσ =
D0
2√−g (gµρgνσ + gµσgνρ −2βgµνgρσ) .
(10)
This form also consistently recovers the Newtonian limit of general relativity [51].
Unfortunately, in Lorentzian
signature, the deWitt metric is not positive semidefinite outside the the slow-moving weak field limit of the theory.
However, as we will see here and in a companion paper [47], the negative eigenvalues of D0,µνρσ appear benign.
Namely, we can use the relation
RµνRµν = CµνρσCµνρσ

(11)
where Cµνρσ is the Weyl curvature tensor and G is the Gauss-Bonnet term, to rewrite the pure gravity part of the

(13)
Since the Gauss-Bonnet term is a topological invariant in d = 4 spacetime dimensions and we do not sum over
different topologies, it is a constant and can be ignored. The fact that it comes with a positive overall coefficent in
the action would otherwise be problematic, since the path integral would favour infintite G. In this way, having three
spatial dimensions is special, not only because the action of (9) is renormalisable in d = 4, but also because only in 4
dimensions is the Gauss-Bonnet term a total divergence and hence a boundary term. In higher dimensions this term
would be non-trivial.
Up to overall constants and a total divergence, this is the action of quadratic gravity without matter, but here
it is purely real, because it describes a classical stochastic process rather than a quantum field theory. The theory
is therefore renormalisable in the gravitational degrees of freedom, since the fact that the action is real does not
affect its renormalisability properties. This is because propagators and vertices are only changed up to constant
factors and this does not influence the convergence of integrals. We have included a short summary of power counting
renormalisability, in Section B of the Appendix. We are also free to choose β so that α2 > 0 (in d = 4 this gives
β < 1/3). Further constraints on its value will follow. The Ricci curvature contributions to the Lagrangian density
then go as −

which acts to suppress deviations away from some constant Ricci curvature.
On the other hand, in [47], we consider the decomposition of the Weyl curvature scalar
CµνρσCµνρσ = 1
8 (EµνEµν −BµνBµν) ,
(14)
into its electric Eµν and magnetic parts Bµν. Both EµνEµν and BµνBµν are non-negative, but it’s only EµνEµν
which contains second time derivatives of the metric. It is only this part of the Weyl curvature contribution which is
of the Onsager-Machlup form, and it acts to suppress paths which have large EµνEµν, as we might expect. On the
other hand, the BµνBµν is non-dynamical. One can choose the discretisation of the path integral into time steps, such
that the magnetic part of the Weyl tensor term changes the probability distribution of the initial slice, but because
it doesn’t contain higher second time derivatives, it is merely part of the normalisation on the initial time slice. This
is more easily seen in phase space. By way of analogy, consider the discretised Onsager-Machlup action

which acts to evolve an initial distribution at step k −1 to one at k a time δt later. The normalisation is found by
integrating the Gaussian integral over all final states momenta pk, and thus the B(pk−1, qk−1)2 is normalised away.
This forms part of the content of [47], and a greater understanding of the implications of this, including whether it
effects diffeomorphism invariance, remains outstanding. However, given its non-dynamical role, it would appear that
the fact that the magnetic Weyl contribution is positive rather than negative, does not result in paths which are far
away from Einstein’s equation, having too great a weight in the path integral.
The matter part of the action with curvature coupling, is very different to that of quadratic gravity, and is given by

This modifies the equations of motion in comparison to those of quadratic gravity, and we include these in Appendix E.
The interpretation of these equations is also very different as we are about to see in the next section.
IV.
NO NEGATIVE NORM GHOSTS
Let us now address the elephant in the room. Although quadratic gravity has garnered widespread interest, owing
to it being renormalisable, it suffers from tachyons or negative norm ghosts. This can be traced back to the appear-
ance of second-order derivatives in the action, which was shown by Ostrogradsky to imply that the Hamiltonian is
unbounded from below [52]. However, problems arise only under the assumption that the action generates determin-
istic evolution. Indeed, actions with second-order (time) derivatives often appear when describing classical stochastic
processes undergoing Brownian motion. Under the assumption of path-continuity, Brownian motion processes can be
described by a stochastic path integral with the probability weighting of each stochastic path given in terms of an
action called the Onsager-Machlup function [46]. When describing a process undergoing Brownian motion through
kicks in momentum, the configuration space Onsager-Machlup function will include second-order time derivatives
when written in terms of the particle position. Let us present a simple example.
Consider the path integral for a free particle undergoing Brownian motion with no drift. The probability of finding
a particle at q(tf) = qf given that at t = 0 it was at q(0) = q0 and had velocity v0 and acceleration a0 is given by the
Onsager-Machlup path integral
P(qf|q0, ˙q0, ¨q0) = 1
N
Z qf

Dq e−

(¨q)2dt.
(17)
Note that the path integral acts to suppress the probability of paths which do not satisfy ¨q = 0, by an amount
controlled by the diffusion constant D2. The larger D2 is, the more stochasticity we are likely to find in the paths
which are realised.
This is an equivalent description of the dynamics often described by the Langevin equation,
¨q = F(q)/m + j(t), with F/m the drift produced by a deterministic force F (here set to 0), and j(t) a stochastic
white noise process. The dynamics can also be described via the Fokker-Planck equation [53] or Ito calculus [54]
and we refer the interested reader to [53] for a derivation of the Onsager-Machlup path integral.
The dynamics
described by the Onsager-Machlup path integral is in contrast to the Euclidean path integral, often used to compute
the partition function. In that case, the Wick-rotation to imaginary time allows one to compute the equilibrium state
of a Hamiltonian, while here, we describe diffusion which in the D2 →0 limit is deterministic Hamiltonian evolution.
In the case where −
1
2D2 = i
ℏ, we would be tempted to interpret ¨q2 as a Lagrangian, with Euler-Lagrange equation
d4q/dt4 = 0. The path integral of Equation (17) is then interpreted as generating deterministic unitary evolution of
a quantum system. However, Lagrangians containing terms second-order or higher in time-derivatives, suffer from
the Ostrogradsky instability [52]. Details on the construction of Ostrogradsky and the resulting instability in general
are given in detail in [55]. For our purposes it suffices to point out that the Hamiltonian which can be constructed
for the Lagrangian ¨q2 is H = P1X2 + P 2

4 , where P1 = ∂L
∂˙q −d
dt
∂L
∂¨q , X2 = ˙q, P2 = ∂L
∂¨q and X1 = q. It is linear in P1
and thus unbounded from below, leading to the instability. This classical instability must manifest itself quantum

7
mechanically, and indeed it does [33, 55, 56], we either obtain negative energy states (from canonical quantization),
or states with negative norms.
On the other hand, when D2 is positive, the path integral of Equation (17) corresponds to the free particle Hamil-
tonian H =
p2
2m with stochastic diffusion around some initial momentum. The higher derivative term in the action
is no longer a problem, as this is already a classical probability distribution of a particle with a stable Hamiltonian,
and no negative energy-modes. The deterministic equation ¨q = 0, with solution q(tf) = q0 + ˙q0t is still the global
maximum with action 0, but there are other extremal points of the form q(tf) = q0 + ˙q0t + 1
2 ¨q0t2 + 1
6αt3 which
also satisfy d4q/dt4 = 0. However, these are not deterministic paths, but rather the most probable path [57, 58],
taken for a particle which reaches a q(tf) and does not necessarily satisfy the deterministic solution ¨q = 0. There is
no Ostrogradsky instability here, because d4q/dt4 = 0 does not correspond to the deterministic equation of motion
generated by a Hamiltonian, but simply tells us the extreme points of the action and thus the most likely trajectories
connecting initial and final conditions.
Another way to see this is to see that one can derive the Onsager-Machlup path integral, by integrating out a
stochastic noise source which has positive energy (see for example, the derivation in Feynman and Hibbs [59] where
the −(¨q)2 action is also considered, or the derivation of Yasue [60] in terms of a Weiner noise process). In contrast,
in the quantum theory, one obtains actions of the form i¨q2, by integrating out a ghost field which must have negative
energy (see for example the pedagogical review in [61]. Note that there are additional degrees of freedom of a sort,
when one considers a path integral of Onsager-Machlup form as can be seen by the most probably path, which in the
case of Brownian motion has a parameter α. However, this merely represents the fact that the acceleration fluctuates.
This is generic, as we can see from the form of the Onsager-Machlup path integral in Eq. (8). If we vary the
Onsager-Machlup action, then since the action is an ”equation of motion squared”, the original equation of motion
will be the global extremal point. Likewise, for the action of Eq. (9), a solution to the Einstein-Hilbert action is still a
global extreme point. The action does not modify the ADM Hamiltonian [62] of general relativity but rather uses the
equations of motion generated by it to construct an Onsager-Machlup-like action describing a diffusive process in the
metric degrees of freedom. The ’propagator’, which is in fact nothing more than the second cumulant of the Onsager-
Machlup probability distribution, generated from it should then be interpreted as a classical correlation function.
Recall here that the path integral is not computing an amplitude in the classical case, but rather a probability. The
two point function, up to constants, has a similar form to that of quadratic gravity [34]

where αw = 1/2 for the action of Eq (12), P (n) are the geometric Barnes-Rivers operators [63–65] given in Appendix D
and △is a gauge-fixing parameter given in Appendix C. Taking the limit △= 0 is equivalent to working in the
harmonic gauge. We can take the Fourier transform of Eq. (18) to get the spatial correlation function. Since this
is required to be positive semi-definite since it gives a classical correlation kernel [53, 54], this implies by Bochner’s
theorem [66], that Eq. (18) be positive semi-definite. This imposes the further condition that not only should α2 be
positive (which in d = 4 requires β < 1
3), but also that α2 > 2αw/3, and α1 = 0. In the quantum case, setting α1 = 0
would be problematic, since it is equivalent to turning off the Einstein-Hilbert action, but here it merely corresponds
to setting Λ = 0 or β = 1/d as we can see from Equations (9) and (13). Since the action should be thought of as
”Einstein’s equation squared” as with Eq (8), we do not expect a term proportional to R unless there is a cosmological
constant.
Indeed with α1 = 0, one can still recover the Newtonian limit [51] and the Schwarzschild solution. It is likewise also
the case that in quadratic gravity one has the Newtonian solutions [34, 67] and, in conformal gravity, cosmological
solutions [68]. With α1 = 0, the action is similar to that of scale-invariant gravity, which is known to be renormal-
isable [69], asymptotically free [70, 71] and, as its name would suggest, scale-invariant and therefore of independent
interest [72, 73].
In quantum quadratic gravity, the coefficient αw is kept negative to protect us from tachyonic
ghosts, so that the overall sign of the action is positive. Here, αw must be positive for normalisability, but this has
no interpretation of a tachyonic particle and is required, in order to get standard diffusive behavior, in actions of the
Onsager-Machlup form (Equation (8)). The path integral is computing a probability and not an amplitude.
In the quantum theory, the P (2)
µνρω term corresponds to a spin-two graviton and P (0)

wave, and the scalar stochastic fluctuations of the metric discussed in [49–51], or in the non-relativistic regime, via the
Newtonian potential sourced by measurements or collapse models [28–30]. In terms of partial fractions the propagator

In general (i.e., in the quantum case), the second term is interpreted as a ghost due to the relative negative sign of
the residue. Further, the −iϵ prescription, which is necessary for renormalizability [55] gives negative norm states,
leading to a loss of unitarity. We can trade unitarity for renormalizability: the presence of these ghost particles,
with the ıϵ prescription spoils unitarity, and allows for negative norm states. This prescription is however necessary
for renormalizability, as we would pick up non-renormalizable residues while Wick-rotating to Euclidean space. In
the classical theory, there is no such interpretation. The relative minus signs between the partial fractions at best
indicate a positive and negative contribution to the correlation kernel which overall is positive semi-definite. While
the evolution is diffusive, probabilities remain positive and normalised by construction. Further, the two terms cannot
be interpreted as the propagators of two different particles, hence the problems of an interacting theory [37], with
ghosts (particles with negative energies) and non-ghost particles interacting and resulting in infinite positive energies
also do not arise.
The Fourier transform of Eq.
(18) can be performed and will depend on how one navigates the poles, or the
boundary conditions. However, since the momentum space propagator goes as 1/k4, it can be seen to be the Green’s
function for the d’Alembertian squared
22G2(x −x′) = δ(4)(x −x′).
(20)
One way to construct such a Green’s function, is to convolute a Green’s function G1(x −x′) for the d’Alembertian
with itself.
G2(x −x′) =
Z
d4y G1(x −y)G1(x′ −y).
(21)
Here, G1(x −y) could be the Feynman, retarded or advanced Green’s function. In the non-relativistic limit, Eq (20)
becomes the biharmonic equation
∇4G(⃗x −⃗x′) = δ(3)(⃗x −⃗x′),
(22)
with solution [74]
G(⃗x −⃗x′) = −1
8π |⃗x −⃗x′|.
(23)
At short distances, this two-point function becomes repulsive on expectation, with a strength that goes to zero at
shorter and shorter distances, although one should exercise caution in its interpretation as it is not a PSD kernel and
is likely to change due to 1-loop corrections at shorter distances. At longer distances, and depending on boundary
conditions, the Green’s function
G2(⃗x −⃗x′) =
1
(4π)2
Z
d3y
1
|⃗y −⃗x||⃗y −⃗x′|
,
(24)
can describe correlations in fluctuations of the gravitational field [49], as can be verified by direct application of ∇4.
Both (23) and (24) can also be extracted in a formal sense from the work of Diosi-Tilloy[30]. Eq. (24) is also the
non-relativistic limit of the retarded Green’s function
G1(x −y) = −δ((t −t′) −|x −x′|)Θ(t −t′)
4π|x −x′|
,
(25)
convoluted with itself.
Just as the quadratic gravity propagator is here reinterpreted as a classical correlation function, the saddle points
of Equation (12) also have a different interpretation.
In the case of quadratic gravity, they are taken to be the
Euler-Lagrange equation of motion [33]. Here, as in the Onsager-Machlup case, they correspond to the most probably
”path” (a spacetime), given an initial and final hypersurfaces. Because the matter part of the action is different to
that of quadratic gravity, the most probable paths not only have a different interpretation here, but they also have a

9
different form. In comparison to quadratic gravity, there are various non-minimal couplings between curvature terms
and matter degrees of freedom as found in I(m) of Equation (16). We compute the most probably paths in the classical
limit, by varying the action in Section E.
V.
DISCUSSION
Let us now summarise the main findings of this work. Together with [47], we have found that although the tensor
D0,µνρσ is not positive semi-definite, its negative eigenvalues appear benign, since they correspond to a boundary
term, or one which can be cancelled by normalisation.The main caveat which should be emphasised, is that we do
not fully understand the effect of the cancellation of the magnetic part of the Weyl curvature by the normalisation,
and this could have unintended consequences, for example, the theory may no longer be covariant [47]. We have
further found that the path integral of the classical-quantum theory of gravity is renormalisable and connected it
to quadratic gravity. However, unlike quadratic gravity, the theory doesn’t suffer from tachyons or negative norm
ghosts. While actions with higher time derivatives terms such as SQ =
i
ℏ
R
dt(¨q)2 lead to negative norm states in
the quantum theory, they are common in stochastic theories, and describe diffusive process with Onsagar-Machlup
action SOM = −
1
2D2
R
dt(¨q)2. The key difference is that the former path integral is computing an amplitude, while
the latter is computing a probability distribution, where one expects the action to be of the form of an equation of
motion squared. As such, the R2 and CµνρσCµνρσ terms are natural and don’t lead to ghosts. Although the action
of [2] was constructed in terms of the ”Einstein’s equations squared” we can in retrospect consider the more general
form given by Eq (12) without worrying about the translation of coupling constants given by Eqs (13). Likewise with
the matter-curvature couplings of Eq (16). One can then constrain their values by demanding that the two point
function be positive semidefinite and that the path integral be normalisable.
We have computed the equations of motion including coupling to matter, which here have the interpretation of most
likely spacetimes given an initial and final hypersurface. In the classical theory, the propagator of Eqn (18) describes
classical correlations in the gravitational field which arise due to stochastic fluctuations, rather than an amplitude.
The two-point function provides an experimentally testable signature of the theory as described in [49]. Requiring the
two-point function to be positive semi-definite appears to single out the asymptotically free theory, which is favoured
by considerations of naturalness.
The fact that the theory is asymptotically free has a number of consequences. Here, the coupling strength of the
action of Eq (12) is the dimensionless quantity
D0
G2
N , since
R
d4xR2 is dimensionless. In Planck units, D0 has units of
Planck length lP to the fourth. It is the GN
l4
P
coupling which goes to zero at short distances. This is reflected in the
fact that the Green’s function is a solution to 22G2(x −y) = δ(4)(x −y), which has solutions which are well behaved
at the origin. While the Schwarszchild solution has zero action and is therefore a global extremum given the boundary
conditions, there are other contributions to the path integral which need to be included [75]. Since it is believed that
singularities in black holes can be avoided or weakened in asymptotically safe gravity (see [76] and references therein),
this raises the prospect that at short distances, there is no singularity.
The modification to gravity at short distances also has implications for tests on the quantum nature of spacetime.
These fit into a number of categories. Those based on the detection of gravitationally induced entanglement [77, 78]
are unaffected by the results presented here since they aim to verify entanglement generation or coherence [79]
(c.f. [80]) over comparatively long length scales, which would still falsify local classical-quantum theories which cannot
generate entanglement. On the other hand, as emphasised in [1, 30, 49], experiments based on the decoherence-vs-
diffusion trade-off or bounds on anomalous heating can be sensitive to how gravity changes at shorter distances.
The non-relativistic models of [29, 30] are ruled out by both the trade-off [49] and tests of anomalous heating [30]
unless another length scale is introduced. Indeed, any models such as [28, 29] which are based around sourcing the
Newtonian potential or spacetime metric from measurements or stochastic collapse models, would naively suggest
that a fundamental CQ theory will be constrained by anomalous heating bounds [30, 81–86], without a cut-off, which
in some models can be as large as the proton radius. While the introduction of another length scale may appear
artificial, the results of this work suggest that it was retrospectively prudent.
This is because in theories such as [1, 2] there is no external collapse model – the classical nature of spacetime
directly induces decoherence in the quantum system, and the dynamics does not reduce to a Lindblad equation if the
gravitational degrees of freedom are integrated out. Classicalisation is mediated by spacetime itself. Since the gravity
sector is renormalisable, and indeed asymptotically free at short distances, we see here that relativistic models are
indeed naturally modified at short distances, and the decoherence-diffusion couplings D2D0 will become smaller as
the backreaction D1 becomes smaller. This is the case if the decoherence-vs-diffusion trade-off is saturated as it is

10
in [2], in which case the quantum state remains pure conditioned on the classical spacetime [44]. Since D0/G2
N is
dimensionless and runs to zero, one expects to generate another length scale by dimensional transmutation as happens
in QCD. This can happen at any scale, and would be determined by experiment. Since gravity is only tested down
to the millimeter scale, a better understanding of the short distance behavior of the theory, both experimentally and
from a theoretical point of view, could allow for other precision tests of this scale.
Further understanding of the free parameters of the theory could come from CMB data. Since the classical-quantum
theory requires an R2 term in the action, and induces an R term once matter degrees of freedom are taken into account,
this suggests that the well known model of Starobinsky inflation [87–89] is favoured. Indeed, the Starobinksy model
is also favoured by cosmological observations [90]. This would appear to both give further credence to the theory
in [1, 2], and allow for constraints from the CMB on parameters in the theory. Here, one ought to have a better
understanding of the non-minimal coupling terms in Eq. (16). These are expected to induce couplings in R [91] which
act as a dynamically generated Planck scale. While the present work suggests that gravity can be described in terms
of a classical spacetime to arbitrarily short distances, we have not addressed the question of whether the theory is
renormalisable in the matter degrees of freedom, or whether it can be made renormalisable. The appearance of terms
proportional to the stress-energy tensor contracted with itself in Eq. (16) are not power-counting renormalisable,
unless protected, which can happen in the case of open quantum systems [92]. Without protection of some kind, the
matter sector of the theory may only be an effective theory, only valid at low energy in the quantum fields.
Finally, it’s worth reflecting on the current evidence for a quantum vs classical nature of spacetime. While several
reasons have been given for why it’s reasonable to consider the hypothesis that spacetime should be treated as classical
vs quantum [93], the credence one gives to the idea has been largely a matter of taste (the black-hole information
paradox and status of the measurement postulate being two of the original motivating reasons for considering the
theory).
However, the fact that the classical path integral is both consistent and renormalisable in d = 4 while
the quantum theory is not, would favour the former over the latter.
The failure of the quantum theory to be
renormalisable is what motivates alternatives like string theory, but these require additional structure such as extra
dimensions and supersymmetry, while the classical theory does not. Furthermore, string theory has higher order
curvature couplings [94–96] as does effective field theory [97]. This results in tachyons and ghosts, while the classical-
quantum theory does not have such difficulties. While the ghosts may be removed in the full non-perturbative theory,
there is no reason to believe this happens. So although the hypothesis that spacetime is classical may appear startling
at first, the fact that the pure gravity theory is renormalisable does provide significant weight in its favour. This
further necessitates the need for experiments to probe the classical vs quantum nature of spacetime.

Appendix A: Comparison of classical, quantum, and classical-quantum path integrals
The classical-quantum path integral generalizes the Feynman-Vernon path integral of open quantum systems and
the stochastic path integral of classical systems. In [32], we compare and contrast these three different path integrals,
and for convenience, we include Table I below.

the diffusion matrix D2. In the case where the force is determined by a Lagrangian Lc, the action SC describes suppression of paths away

(b) A path integral for a general autonomous quantum system, here taken to be ϕ. The quantum path integral is doubled since it includes
a path integral over both the bra and ket components of the density matrix, here represented using the ± notation. In the absence of
the Feynman Vernon term SF V
[45], the path integral represents a quantum system evolving unitarily with an action S[ϕ]. When the
Feynman Vernon action SF V is included, the path integral describes the path integral for dynamics undergoing Lindbladian evolution
[101, 102] with Lindblad operators Lα(ϕ). Because of the ± cross terms, the path integral no longer preserves the purity of the quantum
state, and there will generally be decoherence by an amount determined by D0. As an example, taking L± = ϕ±(x) a local field, and

(c) A phase space path integral for continuous, autonomous classical-quantum dynamics. The path integral is a sum over all classical
paths of the variables q, ˙q, as well as a sum over the doubled quantum degrees of freedom ϕ±. The action contains the purely quantum
term from the quantum path integral in Table Ib, but also includes the term iSC + iSCQ. This suppresses paths away from the averaged
drift, which is sourced by both purely classical terms described by the Hamiltonian Hc and the back-reaction of the quantum systems on
the classical ones, described by a classical-quantum interaction potential VI. The most general form of classical-quantum path integral can
be found in [32]. In order for the dynamics to be completely positive, the decoherence-diffusion trade-off 4D2 ⪰D−1
0
must be satisfied
[25, 27, 49], where D−1
0
is the generalized inverse of D0, which must be positive semi-definite. When the trade-off is saturated, the path
integral preserves the purity of the quantum state, conditioned on the classical degree of freedom [44].

Appendix B: Renormalisability of the path integral
Here we recall the proof of power-counting renormalisability. For a full proof of renormalisability in the context of
quadratic gravity, see [33].
Consider a Feynman diagram with NV vertices, NI internal lines, and NL loops. Each propagator contributes a
factor q−4, each vertex contributes a factor q to the power up to 4, and each loop contributes a factor q4. Hence for
most divergent diagram we have
qDN = q4NV q4NLq−4NI,
(B1)
where DN is superficial degree of divergence. Using the topological identity
NI = NL + NV −1
(B2)
we can write
qDN = q4NV q4NLq4(1−NL−NV ) = q4.
(B3)
Hence the superficial degree of divergence does not increase with the number of loops and the theory is power
counting-renormalisable.
