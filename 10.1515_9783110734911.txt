Introduction
Experts are at the heart of any fact-cultivating enterprise. … Today, though, something has
shifted: the once-stable framework of facts and reliable knowledge that has supported our
liberal democracies is showing signs of fracture (Daniels 2021: 137–140).
Because the experts fill a genuine need for order in the chaotic whirl of high-tech, high-speed
living, some of us remain stunningly blind to their pervasive, invasive, encroachment on the
prerogatives of our private lives, as well as to the possibility that something besides pure be-
nevolence motivates their actions (Chafetz 1995: xiv).
In this book we tell the story of the decay of institutionalized trust as the lodestone
of expert authority. We also highlight the legitimacy struggles engaged in by vari-
ous expert groups to revivify the latter through strategies which do not follow the
orthodox ‘professionalization playbook’ in which a combination of formal creden-
tialism and jurisdictional regulation are the dominant elements.
Instead of striving to restore the orthodox or received ‘rational/deferential’
model of expert authority, we focus on the emergence of a ‘reflexive/deliberative’
model which is much more open, inclusive and collaborative than the former. How-
ever, we do not underestimate how difficult it will be to make the ‘reflexive/delib-
erative’ model a reality in a socio-historical context where economic dislocation,
ideological polarization and political fragmentation have cumulatively challenged
and threatened expert authority in manifold ways. Insofar as contestation lies at
the organizational core of the ‘reflexive/deliberative’ model, then so will its inher-
ent instability, fragility and complexity. Nevertheless, we suggest that a much more
open, dynamic and flexible model of expert authority and governance is required
if the latter is to retain the ‘adaptable resilience’ needed in a world of high risks,
high stakes decision-making where established conventions and predictions are
scarce.
Although they are separated by more than two and a half decades, the quotes
from Daniels (2021) and Chafetz (1995) which head-up this introductory chapter il-
lustrate how far we have travelled, ideologically, politically and culturally from the
‘high water mark’ of established expert authority and all its core presumptions
in favour of the latter as an institutional articulation of disinterested objectivity
in liberal democracies. Chafetz’s polemic against expert authority and its curtail-
ment of individual liberty and weakening of collective resolve was published
26 years before Daniels’ encomium for higher education as the primary institution-
al home of the objective expert knowledge fundamental to liberal democracy. How-
ever, he anticipates much of the excoriating critique of ‘experts’ which is to follow
in the succeeding decades. Indeed, the very fact that Daniels feels the need to re-
state the case for universities as the cultivators and curators of the objective expert
https://doi.org/10.1515/9783110734911-001

knowledge required to sustain, practically and ethically, liberal democracy shows
how serious the corrosive impact of more than two decades of neoliberal and pop-
ulist critique has become by the third decade of the twenty-first century!
This book traces this transition from a rational/deferential conception of ex-
pert authority which rarely feels the need to justify itself – apart from the rare oc-
casions on which it fails to live-up to its own exacting standards – to a reflexive/
deliberative model in which the demand to respond to challenges and threats to
its legitimacy are ever-present. It begins by scrutinising the established model of
‘professional authority’ as the overarching theoretical template for understanding
all forms of expertise-based legitimacy conceptually grounded in a Neo-Weberian
analysis of institutionalized domination structures. This is followed by three inter-
linked chapters in which escalating attacks on the institutionalized trust relations
which underpin the rational/deferential model are documented and evaluated
within three overlapping but distinctive analytical narratives. The latter, in differ-
ent ways and to different degrees, chart the fracturing of the core social, political
and economic foundations on which the latter depended for its legitimacy and sta-
bility.
Chapter 5 focuses on the Covid-19 pandemic and the opportunities which it of-
fers to expert groups to revivify their authority and status by providing the highly
specialized knowledge and technical interventions whereby the extreme risks
and uncertainties presented by a global disease and its highly disruptive impact
on ‘normal life’ can be contained and mitigated. It also highlights the ‘double-
edged’ nature of the opportunities which the pandemic offers in the ‘clear and pre-
sent danger’ that it entails to public trust in expert authority as experts find them-
selves drawn increasingly into a political decision-making process in which their
independence and autonomy is compromised, if not tainted, by closer association
with political power. They may have no choice but ‘to sup with the devil’ as they
become more intimately involved in high-risk mitigation and public order manage-
ment, but their need for a ‘long spoon’ becomes more evident as the boundaries
between ‘expert authority’ and ‘political authority’ are inevitably weakened and
narrowed.
In the following chapter we identify the nature and significance of the emer-
gence of a ‘reflexive mode of expert authority and governance’ which departs, in
several crucial respects, from the institutional logic and organizational practice
on which the orthodox ‘rational/deferential model’ outlined in chapter two rested.
We see this development, with all its complexities and uncertainties, as a cumula-
tive collective response to the mounting failings and limitations of the established
model. These have become more evident over the preceding decades-long critique
of the latter’s pivotal assumptions concerning the inherent stability of liberal rep-
resentative democracy and the unbreachable disinterested objectivity of scientific

knowledge. Both presuppositions played a key role in intellectually buttressing and
practically legitimating the rational/deferential model of expert authority. Howev-
er, they have become subject to an intensity and scale of critique that putatively
undermines their veracity and sustainability.
Reflexive expert authority and governance is presented as a more realistic and
resilient model better suited to the endemic uncertainties and instabilities of po-
litical, economic and cultural life in twenty-first century societies. Yet, we cannot
deny that it is also characterized by levels of contestation and tension which
make it much more tendentious and unpredictable as to its functioning and the
outcomes it produces. But we also contend that it is a necessary precondition
for a more responsible form of expert authority and governance to re-emerge
and regain the public trust on which its continued existence and effectiveness cru-
cially depends.
The final two chapters of this book look more towards the future as they
reflect on the kind of challenges which experts are likely to encounter as the twen-
ty-first century unfolds and the need for a ‘new social contract’ in which that fu-
ture can be potentially secured. If, as seems very likely, experts will inhabit a twen-
ty-first century expert ecology in which negotiated conventions, understandings
and improvisations, as much, if not more, than formalized rules, regulations
and accreditations lie at the core of expert practice, then their reliance on their
tacit interpretive judgements – mediated through reliable and relevant accumulat-
ed knowledge within and across their specialist fields – will inevitably increase
over time. Of course, emerging digital technologies and new expert systems yet
to be developed will also play an increasingly important role in supporting expert
decision-taking. Yet the need for interpretive judgement based on tacit knowledge
and ‘synthetic flexibility’ across a range of specialist domains is unlikely to disap-
pear in a world where high stakes, high risk decision contexts will proliferate. In-
deed, all the evidence suggests that reflexively negotiated expert interpretations
and judgements are likely to become even more critical in situations where formal-
ized rules and regulations cannot keep pace with the complexities and uncertain-
ties of the high stakes, high risks decision-making contexts in which increasing
numbers of experts will work in mid-twenty-first century societies.
During these final two chapters we also revisit theories of ‘reflexive modern-
ization’ developed by analysts such as Giddens and Beck, but in much changed
socio-historical circumstances from those in which they advanced their ideas at
the end of the twentieth century when underlying optimism about the long-term
trajectory and impact of globalization was at its zenith. In the three decades or
so which have followed this ‘Whig-like optimism’ about the necessarily progressive
dynamic inherent in the process of globalization has been severely dented, some
would say decimated, by a succession of economic, political, medical and military

crises that have undermined the epistemological assumptions and structural con-
ditions on which the former depended for its intellectual authority and govern-
mental legitimacy. We are living through much more dangerous and uncertain
times in which the combined threats of global economic recession, political polar-
ization, military conflict, cultural fragmentation and environmental degradation
seem to overwhelm whatever remaining belief we have in our individual and col-
lective capacity to deal with them in ways that enhance the ‘common good’. Under
these kinds of conditions, the shift from ‘passive trust’ based on institutionalized
authority to ‘active trust’ grounded in openly contested and renegotiable expert le-
gitimacy becomes infinitely more difficult to bring off as the latter can no longer
rely on the natural inertia and widespread compliance built into the former.
Nevertheless, we have drawn upon theories of ‘flexible modernization’ be-
cause we see them are providing crucial intellectual resources for navigating a
course between the extreme pessimism of visions anticipating an ‘existential col-
lapse’ in expert authority or, alternatively, the obdurate complacency of those ad-
vocating a ‘business as usual’ take on expert futures. For us, neither of these posi-
tions can provide an understanding of and explanation for the inherent dynamism
of expert authority as it struggles to reset its legitimacy and status within a socio-
historical context in which many of the material and normative props which it tra-
ditionally relied upon to support its positioning have become badly corroded and
decayed.
In the final chapter of this book, we set out a broad-ranging scenario for the
kind of wider intellectual and political innovations which need to occur if our
model of reflexive expert authority and governance is to stand any chance of
being practically realizable and sustainable. We do not offer this analysis as
some sort of instruction manual or recipe book as to how reflexive expert author-
ity and governance is to be constructed and enacted. Rather, we see it as offering a
‘framework of potentialities’ within which the latter might find greater traction
and support in twenty-first century conditions which are sure to be as, if not
more, challenging than those experts faced in the past.

Introduction

Chapter 1: Theorizing Expert Authority
1 Introduction
Debates about the nature, status and significance of expert authority have been do-
minated by a ‘received model’ of how the latter emerges and becomes established
as a relatively stable institutional form and sustainable organizational practice
(Davies 2018; Eyal 2019; Collins et al. 2020). This received model has been construct-
ed around key structural elements of a neo-Weberian ideal type of professional oc-
cupational association and control in which the rationalization and formalization
of advanced specialized knowledge and the socio-technical practices these process-
es generate provide a formidable mechanism of social closure and exclusion (Ab-
bott 1988; Macdonald 1995; Larson 2013; Burns 2019; Saks 2021). By legitimating the
monopoly occupational supply of and control over scarce cognitive resources and
technical skills through claims to scientific objectivity, disinterested public service
and practical efficacy, professional modes of association and practice became es-
tablished as the institutional exemplars of ‘expert authority in action’ by the twen-
tieth century.
However, it has become increasingly difficult to maintain this established or
received model of expert authority in the late twentieth and early twenty-first cen-
turies as it has been repeatedly challenged by theoretical critiques and socio-tech-
nical changes that fundamentally question its cogency and viability. If the received
model of expert authority is based on a ‘crown jewels’ conception of science (Col-
lins at al. 2020) and a ‘liberal public service’ mode of professional association and
practice (Marquand 2004; Moran 2007; Davies 2018, 2020a) which can no longer be
analytically sustained in anything like their ideal typical forms, then it seems we
need to rethink the way in which we theorize what continues to be such a central
social and organizational phenomenon in contemporary societies.
With this need for a ‘radical reappraisal’ of how we theorize the established
model of expert authority in mind, this chapter opens with an outline of the
major conceptual components of the latter and the way they were analytically in-
tegrated within the neo-Weberian ideal type of professional occupational associa-
tion and work organization. Subsequently, it moves on to consider the major ‘nar-
ratives’ or ‘theses’ which have challenged the theoretical dominance and empirical
sustainability of the neo-Weberian conceptualization of expert authority – that is,
the ‘de-legitimation narrative’, the ‘demystification narrative’ and the ‘decomposi-
tion narrative’. The chapter concludes with an assessment of the most significant
divergences between the received or orthodox model of expert authority and those
emerging from these three narratives as they identify an escalating crisis in the
https://doi.org/10.1515/9783110734911-002

institutional foundations and organizational forms through which the latter has
been legitimated and practiced.
2 The Ideal Type of Expert Authority
Much has been written about Weber’s definition and deployment of ‘ideal types’ in
sociological research and analysis (Albrow 1990; Ray and Reed 1994; Turner 1993;
Runciman 2002; Anter 2014; Reed 2020), but Parkin (1982: 28) provides a succinct
and accessible summary of the former:
Ideal types are conceptual abstractions that we employ in trying to get to grips with the com-
plexities of the social world. Weber rightly points out that we cannot grasp social phenomena
in their totality. Patterns of behaviour and institutional forms like capitalism, or Protestan-
tism, or bureaucracy are each composed of many interconnected elements, both normative
and structural. In order to comprehend any such institution or social formation it is neces-
sary to reduce it to its core components. We do this by singling out and accentuating the cen-
tral or basic features of the institution in question and suppressing or downgrading those fea-
tures that could be considered marginal to it.
As Parkin goes on to point out, Weber was well-aware that there will be a signifi-
cant degree of arbitrariness about which ‘core elements’ are selected and accentu-
ated and those that are marginalized or even ignored. But this process of, often
extreme, conceptual selection and abstraction is driven by the research questions
which are being asked and the wider theoretical frameworks and philosophical
traditions in which they are embedded. Thus, ideal types are seen to function as
a form of ‘analytical benchmark or yardstick’ against which empirical cases can
be compared and evaluated. The divergences, rather than similarities, between
the ideal type and the empirical forms or patterns under investigation become
the focus of analytical and explanatory attention insofar as the latter necessarily
exhibit ‘abnormalities’ or ‘discrepancies’ from the former requiring further anal-
ysis.
Consequently, the neo-Weberian ideal type of expert authority has been con-
structed and developed as a distinctive form of ‘legitimate domination’. Within
the latter, the power of certain occupational associations and groups possessing ad-
vanced specialized knowledge and the complex repertoire of socio-technical skills
emerging from them is authorized and sanctioned in ways that allows them to se-
cure and retain monopoly control over the ways in which they are acquired and
deployed. Of course, this ‘authorizing and sanctioning’ process is highly contested
and contingent upon support from other key groups and institutions such as polit-
ical and economic elites, state bureaucrats and the judiciary.

Chapter 1: Theorizing Expert Authority

But the paradigm case or exemplar of expert authority, as a form of legit-
imate domination, consists of a set of positionings and claims, occupied and made
by those who have successfully mounted what Larson (2013) calls ‘professionaliza-
tion projects’ authorizing and sanctioning their power to control those segments or
domains (Abbott 1988) of the labour market/working environment for expert serv-
ices pertaining to their interests and the material and social rewards accruing
from them. Not all expert occupational groups aspire to, or can realistically ach-
ieve, formal legitimation and recognition as ‘professionals’ – that is, as members
of a formal association who accredit, license, educate, train and develop their prac-
titioners with a relatively high degree of internal self-governance and management
(Burns 2019; Saks 2021). It is also the case – as we show in subsequent chapters of
this book – that ‘existing forms of professional expertise are now in flux in ways
not seen before’ (Burns 2019: 287) to the extent that they have been commodified,
rationalized and routinized by a conjuncture of economic, political and technolog-
ical transformations whose cumulative impact fundamentally questions the foun-
dations of the ‘professional state’ as it has been dissected and explained by succes-
sive generations of neo-Weberian researchers and scholars since the middle of the
twentieth century. Indeed, it is as a result of this research and scholarship that we
have increasingly been made aware of how complex, contested and contingent suc-
cessful professionalization projects are, as well as of how much they depend on
favourable exogenous political, economic and social conditions beyond the endog-
enous intra-organizational dynamics of the ‘system of professions’ itself (Abbott
1988; Macdonald 1995; Leicht 2016).
Yet, it is vital to remember – as Weber himself clearly recognized – that this
neo-Weberian ideal typical conceptualization of ‘expert authority as legitimate
domination’ in the labour market for professionalized expert services and the
wider expert division of labour which it generates and reproduces crucially de-
pends on the active and positive commitment of those requiring such services
who are usually, but not always, in a subordinate or supplicant position to experts.
The client or customer for expert services must retain a sufficient degree of trust
in and commitment to the authority of those experts providing them if the latter
are to remain in a position where they can confidentially expect the former to ac-
cept their commands and instructions. If this subordinate/client commitment and
acceptance becomes increasingly more contested and contingent, then the danger
is that expert authority begins to see its claims to legitimacy weakened and the
aura masking its operation demystified and critiqued.
As neo-Weberian researchers and scholars (Parkin 1979; Freidson 1986, 1994;
Krause 1996; Larson 2013; Johnson 2016; Gorman and Vallas 2020; Saks 2021)
have repeatedly highlighted, successful ‘professionalization projects’ – as evi-
denced by elite professions such as medicine and law – depend on complex com-

binations of structural and processual factors emerging within particular socio-
historical contexts supportive of the developmental trajectories they generate. In-
sofar as these mobility projects consist of two, closely linked, control strategies re-
lating to monopoly control over specialized knowledge and skill within the labour
market for expert services and organizational control over work domains within
the workplace, then they must simultaneously engage in activities aimed at secur-
ing ‘epistemic exclusion’ and ‘jurisdictional closure’ (Larson 2013; Abbott 1988;
Freidson 1994; Reed 1996, 2018). While the former relates to the capacity of an oc-
cupational group to develop and protect an exclusive cognitive/knowledge base
combining high levels of theoretical abstraction and technical indeterminacy, the
latter relates to its ability to translate this monopoly epistemological control into
domains of specialized work activity which can be closed-off from other groups.
This combination of exclusion and closure, if effectively constructed and sustained,
provides a powerful structural mechanism through which occupational groups can
establish and legitimate their claims to expert authority and the material and sym-
bolic advantages which it conveys. It can also ensure that their work activity re-
tains a relatively high degree of ‘in-determination’ in that it remains largely be-
yond the monitoring and control of externally imposed rules in ways facilitating
uncertainty, even secrecy and mystery, over how it is to be performed and evalu-
ated (Larson 2013: 41–42). Indeed, the shifting balance between ‘in-determination’
and ‘codification’ entailed within an ongoing ‘dialectic of control’ (Giddens 1994)
between autonomous self-management and external regulation constitutes, Larson
argues, the fulcrum around which legitimation struggles between expert groups
claiming recognition as a ‘profession’ are fought out.
Epistemic monopoly crucially depends on the collective capacity of an aspiring
profession and those professionals who are recognized, and recognize themselves,
as its members and practitioners to claim the ‘authority of science’ in endorsing
the standing and status of their ‘expertise’. Their authority derives from the fact
that their expertise rests upon an objective, universal and esoteric knowledge
base from which specialized interventions directed at the disinterested identifica-
tion and treatment of complex human and technical problems can be effectively
undertaken. Their expertise is legitimated, at least in part, through their appropri-
ation of scientific rationality in ways which demonstrate that the advanced, spe-
cialized knowledge which only they control, codify and co-ordinate is derived
from universal principles and rigorous practices accumulated through disciplined
abstraction, experimentation, testing and confirmation undertaken by scientists
stretching over centuries. Larson (2013: 180–181) summaries the key features of
‘epistemic exclusion’ as entailing ‘the capacity to claim esoteric and identifiable
skills – that is, to create and control a cognitive and technical base’. By constructing
and controlling a scientific knowledge base from which cognitive exclusiveness can
8
Chapter 1: Theorizing Expert Authority

be asserted and from which specialized technical skills can be monopolized and
marketized, certain occupational groups can begin to mount ‘professionalization
projects’ giving them the potential capacity to legitimate their domination of the
working environments in which they operate.
But this ‘epistemic exclusion’, on its own, is not enough to realize a successful
professionalizing project leading to a form of legitimate domination supportive of
professional status; it must be combined with ‘jurisdictional closure’ through an
organizational strategy bringing areas of work-related activity within which
such specialized knowledge and techniques are applied under exclusive professio-
nal control. The effective implementation of the latter entails the translation of ab-
stract theoretical knowledge and learned technique into sets of working routines
or ‘methodological templates’ (Brown 2019) around which practical boundaries can
be constructed and policed by certain occupational groups against actual or poten-
tial incursion by competitor groups. These templates of operational practices and
routines provide the power base from which defined areas of work activity are re-
lational and discursively ‘closed off ’ to competitor groups within a complex ecol-
ogy of interdependent occupational groups routinely engaged in strategies and tac-
tics directed to the carving-out and protection of ‘their’ jurisdictional domain. To
engage in a successful professionalization project requires the effective linking
of ‘epistemic exclusion’ to ‘jurisdictional closure’ by means of operational method-
ologies or templates translating abstract cognitive power and control into practical
workplace domains and spaces in which self-regulation over and management of
‘work performances’ can be routinely secured.
This combination of ‘epistemic exclusion’ and ‘jurisdictional closure’ is further
strengthened through the – always contestable and contested – construction of a
configuration of integrative mechanisms driving towards formal institutionaliza-
tion and hierarchical organization. Thus, legally-supported accreditation and li-
censing, standardized career training and development provided by universities
and colleges, forms of internal and external occupational regulation combining
meritocracy and collegiality, as well as the extensive paraphernalia of implicit ‘un-
derstandings’ associated with admittance to and progression within ‘the profes-
sion’ bolster the drive towards institutionalizing the processes through which ex-
pert market power is transformed into professional authority. Once exclusion
and closure have been effectively combined and stabilized in ways that have se-
cured a sufficient degree of monopoly control within the marketplace and work-
place, then a professionalizing project has the potential to be successfully pursued.
They are the epistemological and organizational building blocks on which pro-
fessionalizing projects legitimating the dominant labour market positioning and
workplace control of certain occupational groups claiming expert authority are
founded. When they are effectively combined, ‘exclusion’ and ‘closure’ generate
2 The Ideal Type of Expert Authority

the third precondition for the realization of a successful professionalization proj-
ect in which expert authority is stabilized and reproduced – that is, the generation
and maintenance of relatively high levels of uncertainty, secrecy and mystery in
the performance and assessment of the expert group’s core work activities such
that they remain inherently resistant to rationalization and codification.
However, this potential is only likely to be fulfilled if two further contextual
conditions are established; first, active and sustained support from political and
administrative elites occupying key positions within the state apparatus and, sec-
ond, the institutionalization of an ethic of ‘liberal public service’ in which expert
occupational groups take on the public persona of trusted public servants deploy-
ing their expertise on behalf of the ‘general good’ or ‘society-at-large’ rather than
their own vested interests or those of some other group.
Previous discussion has suggested that at the analytical core of the neo-Weber-
ian ideal type of expert authority lies the idea that certain occupational groups
with the capacity to access, develop and apply scientific knowledge within the mar-
ketplace and the workplace are able to ‘extend their powers of self-evaluation and
self-control [so]that they become almost immune to external regulation’ (Larson
2013: xii). But this focus on the internal mechanisms through which special occupa-
tions translate expert power and control into ‘legitimate domination’ has been
complemented by an exploration of the external mechanisms by means of which
expert groups strengthen their market and organizational authority – that is, by
gaining support from state elites and from the general public through the promul-
gation of an ethic of ‘liberal public service’.
In the case of elite professions – in fields such as medicine, law, science, and
architecture – Larson (2013: xii) insists that the sustained support of political, eco-
nomic and social elites occupying or with access to powerful positions with the
state’s administrative apparatus was, and remains, critical to them mounting suc-
cessful professionalization projects:
Professions ultimately depend on the power of the state, and they originally emerge by the
grace of powerful protectors. The privileged position of a profession is thus secured by the
political and economic influence of the elite which sponsors it … an account of the process
by which professions emerge illuminates the fact that professions gain autonomy; in this pro-
tected position, they can develop with increasing independence from the ideology of the dom-
inant social elites. The fact remains, however, that their privileges can always be lost.
This remains as true today as it has since the emergence of ‘expertise’ as a key
source of occupational power and organizational control from the late seventeenth
century (Johnson 1994; Krause 1996; Davies 2018). The translation of the latter into
‘legitimate domination’ still crucially depends on the capacity of proto-typical ex-
pert groups claiming special privileges within labour markets and work organiza-

tions being able to secure state support for cognitive, normative and organizational
strategies directed at enhanced autonomy and self-management within the juris-
dictional domains or fields in which they operate. So, as Larson (2013: 3) notes,
‘knowledge of Latin distinguished the “learned” professions from the craft guilds
that developed in the towns between the eleventh and thirteenth century [because
it] increased the aura of mystery surrounding the professions’ esoteric knowledge,
while Latin clearly associated them with the world of the elites.’ In a similar fash-
ion, contemporary expert groups require state support for formal accreditation
and licensing, regulation of their relationships with clientele, and self-management
of their conduct and performance in ways that distinguishes them, indeed sets
them apart, from actual or competitor groups. In the twenty-first century, expert
groups need the state to support – legally, administratively and ideologically –
their claims to ‘special status and esoteric knowledge’ and the privileges which
flows from them in much the same way as medieval priests, scribes and school-
men appropriated linguistic access to and control over religious, bureaucratic
and educational resources vital to the work of the fields in which they operated.
In addition to state support, the neo-Weberian ideal typical model of expert
authority also identifies the securing of ‘institutionalized’ or ‘passive’ trust (Gid-
dens 1994) within the wider community as a precondition for reproducing and sta-
bilizing expert power and control. Traditionally, this has been achieved through the
development and communication of a generic conception of ‘liberal public service’
in which experts play the vital role of accruing, codifying and ministering the eso-
teric knowledge and practical technologies through which social order and the
general wellbeing of the people – particularly in the face of crisis conditions –
can be maintained (Davies 2018, 2020a; Marquand 2004; Moran 2007; Collins
et al. 2020). By demonstrating how dependent ‘we’ are on the knowledge, skills
and technologies that experts can deploy to sustain our ‘normal, everyday lives’,
particularly when they are threatened by events radically undermining and desta-
bilizing the, usually unnoticed, foundations on which the later routinely relies, ‘we’
can see how much we need them to prevent, or at least contain, the Hobbesian
‘war of all against all’ that lies just beneath the surface of our routine existence.
By trusting experts to use the best of their cognitive, technical and organizational
capacities to maintain and protect the social communities and institutions in
which they are embedded – what Larson (2013: chapter 5) conceptualizes as
their service or ‘civilizing function’ as opposed to their power or ‘market-closure
function’ – ‘we’ give them the authority to deploy their knowledge and skills in
whatever way they think appropriate to secure and sustain order and discipline.
As we shall document in succeeding chapters of this book, ‘institutionalized
trust’ in expert power and control has become increasingly difficult – some
would say impossible (see chapter 2) – to sustain in a context where, say, dominant

political discourses and movements have fundamentally undermined the credibil-
ity of ‘experts’ to speak and act on behalf of ‘the people’ or the competition from
other expert groups has become so intense that trust can only be ‘actively and con-
tinuously’ achieved in limited temporal phases and social situations (Giddens 1994;
Beck 1999; Eyal 2019). Nevertheless, attaining and retaining ‘institutionalized trust’
remains a key strategic objective for any group claiming expert authority within
contemporary political economies and societies insofar as it establishes a relatively
secure and resilient form of legitimation that is portable and transferable across
temporal and spatial boundaries. If an expert group has secured a position of ‘in-
stitutionalized trust’ within the societies and communities within which it oper-
ates, then it is much better placed to realize and maintain the substantial political,
economic and social influence which it conveys. Any power struggles emerging
over ‘epistemological exclusion’ and ‘organizational closure’ – with actual or po-
tential competitor experts or with clients and customers increasingly aware of
their capacity to go to the latter for whatever services they need – are likely to
be much more containable, if not winnable, if they are in a position to support
claims to generalized high trust relations with those communities and groups
that they serve as they have become socially and ethically embedded over many
generations.
The five key structural features of the neo-Weberian ideal type of expert au-
thority are listed in figure 1 below. They summarize the theoretical benchmark
against which the emergence, development and impact of challenges and threats
to this established model of expert authority are reviewed and evaluated in sub-
sequent chapters of this book in relation to three analytically structured narratives
of ‘de-legitimation’, ‘demystification’ and ‘decomposition’ which are outlined in the
next section of this chapter.

Chapter 1: Theorizing Expert Authority

3 Analytically Structured Narratives: Conceptual Building
Blocks
The preceding section of this chapter has specified the key analytical components
of the Neo-Weberian ideal type of expert authority. This conceptual abstraction
treats the latter as a form of legitimate domination based, primarily, on market-
place and workplace control over the provision of advanced specialist cognitive
and technical services buttressed by a range of secondary trust-building mecha-
nisms ensuring a substantial degree of moral commitment from those dependent
on such services. In this way, the Neo-Weberian ideal type of expert authority is
based on a logic which analytically abstracts and combines cognitive, technical
and organizational elements in order to generate a model that integrates the en-
dogenous/internal and exogenous/external aspects of such a form of legitimate
domination.
In this section we focus on the overarching analytical architecture of the three
narratives that have been developed over the last two decades or so insofar as they
seriously call into question the theoretical viability and empirical sustainability of
the Neo-Weberian model of expert authority – that is, the ‘de-legitimation narra-
tive’, the ‘demystification narrative’ and the ‘decomposition narrative’. Each of
these narratives is discussed and evaluated in more detail and depth in the follow-
ing three chapters, but, in this section, we focus on their conceptual framing and
rationale insofar as they reveal an underlying configuration of analytical compo-
nents which they share and around which their ‘storylines’ are collectively con-
structed. While the former diverge in several fundamental respects, they also
share overlapping concerns and components as they strive to develop cogent un-
derstandings and coherent explanations as to ‘how’ and ‘why’ the received or or-
thodox model of ‘expert authority’ is no longer tenable in a socio-historical context
where the ‘conditions of possibility’ sustaining the latter have been eviscerated.
Each of the narratives unpacked in the next three chapters are constructed
around three conceptual components: first, a shared focus on a critical conjunc-
ture of structural changes which have, collectively, transformed the economic, po-
litical and social conditions under which expert authority can be institutionalized;
second, a concern with the underlying mechanisms through which the longer-
term impacts of these changes have been mediated and interpreted; finally, an at-
tempt to identify the substantive outcomes which the complex interplay between
structural change and mediating mechanisms has generated. Each narrative theo-
rizes these three key elements of ‘changes’, ‘mechanisms’ and ‘outcomes’ in very
different ways and accounts for the interplay between them by reference to con-
trasting explanatory logics. Yet, they also reveal a collective sensibility to a trans-
formative ‘paradigm shift’ in the material, ideological and political ‘rules of en-
3 Analytically Structured Narratives: Conceptual Building Blocks
13

gagement’ through which expert power and control is rewarded, legitimated and
organized. While they vary considerably in their judgements and estimations of
the scale of the challenge and threats which the established form of expert author-
ity faces, they agree that ‘business as usual’ is no longer a viable option for the lat-
ter in a world where its social and cultural foundations have been profoundly de-
stabilised, and its structural integrity substantially eroded.
3.1 Changes
If expert authority is a form of legitimate domination based on effective market-
place and workplace control over the possession and provision of expert services,
justified in terms of their technical efficacy and moral trustworthiness, then all
three narratives agree that it is in serious trouble today and for the foreseeable
future. Collectively, the latter begin their analyses of ‘why’ and ‘how’ expert author-
ity has been weakened and diminished by focussing on the deep-seated structural
transformations generating instability within the wider socio-historical context in
which it is embedded. These changes – such as neoliberal austerity, authoritarian
populism, state-driven deregulation, elite fragmentation and invasive technologies
of surveillance and control – are regarded as entailing systemic, long-term de-sta-
bilizing changes to the ideological consensus and political settlement that under-
pinned the rise of the post-Second World War social democratic/welfare state
and the key role which experts, technocrats and professionals were given in build-
ing and legitimating its institutional foundations and infrastructure (Blyth 2013;
Raco 2013; Swarts 2013; Wilks 2013; Crouch 2016; Hurt and Lipschutz 2016; Davies
2018, 2020a). In particular, the ‘hollowing out of the state’ and the changing balance
between ‘public’ and ‘private’ power – such that the latter effectively entails the
privatization and marketization of public power in ways which radically weakens
the authority and influence of scientific experts and elite professionals in govern-
ment policy making circles – are seen to generate a much more ‘hostile environ-
ment’ within which a ‘shadow elite’ of policy brokers and fixers emerge in ways
that side-line and marginalize mainstream expert authority (Wedel 2011, 2014; Da-
vies 2017; Navidi 2017; Davis 2018; Geoghegan 2020; Callison and Manfredi 2020).
Overall, underlying structural transformations in the political economy of ex-
pert authority that have been developing since the early 1980s – but which have
been intensified and reinforced during the decade or so following the financial cri-
sis of 2008 and the global, neoliberal-driven ‘austerity’ policy regime that emerged
in response to the latter – are seen to generate an ideological and political context
in which ‘abstract expert systems’ (Giddens 1994; Beck, Giddens and Lash 1994;
14
Chapter 1: Theorizing Expert Authority

Koppl 2018; Eyal 2019) are subjected to much higher levels of public criticism and
distrust.
Under the ‘bureau-professional’ governing regimes (Clarke and Newman 1997;
Newman and Clarke 2009; Noordegraaf and Steijin 2013; Pollitt and Bouckaert
2011) which came to dominate post-1945 social democratic welfare states in Europe
and North America (Whitley 2000; Mizruchi 2013; Streeck 2016) until the early
1980s, a hybrid structure of legitimate domination was established in which eco-
nomic, political and administrative elites effectively shared power with technocrat-
ic, professional and managerial elites. They governed within an overarching ideo-
logical and policy framework in which a wide range of stakeholder interests were
balanced off against each other in order to ensure that the gap between ‘winners’
and ‘losers’ never became so great as to undermine public faith and confidence in
the capacity of the system to deliver outcomes which kept everybody reasonably
happy. Experts played a critical role in providing the objective knowledge and spe-
cialist techniques through which this delicate balancing act could be sustained
over the long term in ways that minimally guaranteed every stakeholder’s vested
interest in keeping the system going by refusing to engage in forms of collective
action that potentially threatened its institutional foundations.
In the next three chapters of this book, we review the various structural
changes documented by each of our respective narratives as they identify the trig-
gers that transformed the wider socio-historical context in which expert authority
operated in ways that radically undermined the ‘bureau-professional’ governing
regime on which the social democratic welfare state had depended for its ideolog-
ical legitimacy and political sustainability. Taken together, they highlight a ‘stealth
revolution’ (Brown 2015) whereby ‘bureau-professionalism’ is eaten-away from the
inside as a result of exogenous changes in its wider political economy which inva-
lidated the ‘producer-dominated cartels’ that it legitimated in favour of ‘consumer-
driven markets’ in which private corporate power becomes the only acceptable
conduit for individual consumer choice.
3.2 Mechanisms
The second conceptual building block – on which our three analytical narratives
describing and explaining the ‘crisis in expert authority’ depends – relates to
the mechanisms by which the key structural changes referred to in previous dis-
cussion are shaped and directed in ways that contribute to the emergence of
major threats to the latter’s sustainability as a system of legitimate domination.
These mechanisms mediate and interpret the impact of structural change by pro-
viding the relational forms and discursive modes through which the demands and
3 Analytically Structured Narratives: Conceptual Building Blocks
15

messages contained within the latter are organized and carried. In this respect, the
‘imperatives’ contained within structural change don’t operate according to some
deterministic logic that imposes itself on actors in a mechanistic fashion. They are
always and everywhere shaped and reshaped by the relational networks in which
actors are embedded and through the discursive narratives which give them mean-
ing and value. Nevertheless, the mechanisms through which societies and organi-
zations mediate and interpret social change are often, if not usually, difficult to
identify and analyse because they do not present themselves in any obvious and
simple way. Indeed, they are usually extremely difficult to discern and ‘unpack’
since they are inherently complex in their internal makeup and their external im-
pact is subject to a wide range of contextual variation and diversity.
As previously indicated, these mediating mechanisms are best conceptualized
as socio-material hybrids which provide the discursive frameworks through which
major structural transformations are narrated and the interlinked disciplinary re-
gimes through which the latter are translated into organizational realities. In many
ways they play a ‘simplifying’ role to the extent that they filter out competing dis-
cursive and organizational translations in ways which justify and operationalize
dominant interpretations of what structural change entails and means for those
social actors who must grapple with its impact and implications. However, they si-
multaneously ‘complexify’ the socio-historical contexts within which structural
change is necessarily embedded by opening-up a range of alternative analytical op-
tics through which the latter might be refracted and viewed. Mediating mecha-
nisms attempt to limit the analytical and organizational options through which
structural change might be interpreted and implemented but in the very act of
doing so they make possible the emergence of creative and innovative alternatives
that escape the embrace of temporarily dominant narratives.
Consequently, mediating mechanisms provide the dominant narrative and or-
ganizational frames through which structural changes can be captured and coor-
dinated as necessarily following certain ‘institutional logics’ (Thornton, Ocasio and
Lounsbury 2012) and the ‘strategic action fields’ within which they are operation-
alized and sustained (Fligstein and McAdam 2012). However, the degree of interpre-
tive and strategic closure which mediating mechanisms achieve through formaliz-
ing and normalizing the narratives and frames they wish to project in relation to
certain ‘institutional logics’ or ‘strategic action fields’ are, at best, partial and con-
tested. They are always open to counter interpretations and interventions that
challenge and potentially over-turn the conventional orthodoxies which the latter
have striven to establish and legitimate. Whatever their stabilizing potential, medi-
ating mechanisms are inherently dynamic and flexible socio-material forms sub-
ject to competition and contestation from alternative narratives and frames telling
16
Chapter 1: Theorizing Expert Authority

very different stories justifying contrasting courses of social action to those project-
ed by proponents of the mainstream view.
In this way, mediating mechanisms frame the socio-material context in which
social actors intervene in the ebb and flow of social life in pursuit of certain out-
comes favourable to their values and interests. They promote and justify certain
courses of social action directed to the realization of social actors’ preferences
and inclinations as they emerge out of successive phases of social struggle and en-
gagement aligned, however well or poorly, with their desire to bring about situa-
tional outcomes in which their hopes and aspirations have some chance of
being translated into social realities.
This takes us to the final conceptual component around which our three ana-
lytical narratives are constructed and promoted – that is, the concept of ‘out-
comes’, and the role it plays in shaping the latter.
3.3 Outcomes
Each of the analytical narratives discussed in the following three chapters of
this book develops an account of the complex dynamics whereby key structural
changes, refracted through the primary mediating mechanisms they identify, im-
pact on established forms of expert authority in ways that threaten the latter’s
ideological legitimacy and organizational integrity. Consequently, they, individually
and collectively, document substantive outcomes which change, and in some cases
fundamentally transform, the ‘conditions of possibility’ for the emergence, stabili-
zation and reproduction of expert authority in ways that radically move us away
from the established Neo-Weberian model. As such, they suggest that we have in-
herited a model of expert authority, largely based on our understanding of modern
professions – and the core occupational and organizational mechanisms through
which the latter establish and sustain ‘legitimate domination’ – which is no longer
conceptually equipped to deal with the complexity it now confronts. Not only do
they insist that the ‘conditions of possibility’ under which the orthodox form of
professionally based expert authority was established have been transformed in
ways which undermine its credibility and sustainability, but also that new forms
of expert power and control have emerged which cannot be accommodated within
its theoretical parameters. Indeed, they emphasize that the proliferation of groups
and organizations claiming expert authority and status, as well as our continued
belief in and dependence on ‘expertise’ – however conditional and contingent
they may be in practice – have generated a much more crowded and competitive
marketplace for the services they provide, so that ‘trust’ must be pro-actively se-
cured and renewed by those claiming it. ‘Taken-for-granted’ assumptions about in-
3 Analytically Structured Narratives: Conceptual Building Blocks
17

stitutionalized trust in expert authority are no longer sustainable in a world in
which the ideological foundations and political scaffolding on and through
which the latter was sustained have become so insecure and corroded as to be
‘unfit for purpose’. As we shall explore in chapter five of this book, this may
even be the case in the context of a major public health crisis where our, literally
‘life and death dependence’ on expert knowledge, skill and technology may be pre-
eminent, but the dangers which this global emergency entails for those anticipat-
ing a renewal of expert authority should not be dismissed or underestimated.
Thus, the third element of the heuristic framework through which the next
three chapters of this book are organized relates to the current condition of expert
authority and what this might mean for its prospects. In some cases, both the anal-
ysis and prognosis as to its present state and future possibilities are very bleak
insofar as they identify a collapse in the institutionalized trust relationship be-
tween ‘experts’ and ‘citizens’ which is irreparable due to the latter’s scale and sig-
nificance. Other analytical narratives are somewhat less apocalyptic than this to
the extent that they envisage the emergence of a more realistic public understand-
ing and appreciation of the inherent limits of expert knowledge and the technolog-
ical and practical interventions which it makes possible. Still others anticipate the
evolution of a ‘hybridized’ form of expert authority embedded within a much more
complex system of expert ecologies in which experts become much more open and
sensitive to their ‘necessary connectivity’ to those whom they serve (Noordegraaf
2020; Reed 2020).
Yet, however much they may differ, indeed disagree, over the scale and depth
of the crisis which expert authority is currently facing, they share a common ap-
preciation of the need for a theoretical approach to our understanding of how ex-
pert power and control are legitimated under very different conditions to those in
which professions became established as the primary occupational carriers and
organizational expressions of institutionalized trust in modern societies. Together,
they point the way to the need for the development of a theoretical approach to
our understanding of expert authority that recognizes and expresses the inherent
complexities and realities of its constitution and articulation in twenty-first centu-
ry societies which we outline in the penultimate chapter of this book.
4 Conclusion
In this introductory chapter we have set out the key features of the Neo-Weberian
ideal typical model of expert authority – as it has been developed by industrial and
political sociologists and organizational theorists over half a century or more – and
of the heuristic underpinnings of the three analytical narratives which have ques-
18
Chapter 1: Theorizing Expert Authority

tioned the latter’s continued theoretical and empirical relevance to twenty-first
century forms of expert power and control.
This model of expert authority presumes a stable structural alignment be-
tween ‘epistemic exclusion’ and ‘jurisdictional closure’ which has become increas-
ingly difficult to sustain in a socio-historical context characterized by escalating
economic insecurity, social fragmentation and political polarization. The mediating
mechanisms through which this alignment has been traditionally secured experi-
ence declining integrative and coordinative effectiveness as they are exposed to in-
tensifying competitive and fragmenting pressures in both the marketplace for ex-
pertise and the workplaces within which it becomes organized. While the former
becomes hyper-competitive and fractured within a deregulated socio-political con-
text in which institutionalized trust is weakened and diluted, the latter begin to
lose their capacity to organize and police conventional occupational boundaries
and hierarchies as they are forced to adapt to new technologies that undermine
and eradicate the divisions on which they were previously established.
As a result, the ‘deus ex machina’ of expert authority – that is, its capacity to
maintain the ‘in-determination’ of its esoteric knowledge base and technical skills
from public exposure by retaining its mysterious, even ‘god-like’ or sacred quality
from all but those ‘few’ who are admitted into its inner sanctum through pro-
longed socialization and training (Grace 2014) – becomes progressively subjected
to the unremitting rationalizing impulses of externally imposed market discipline,
technological deskilling and remote organizational control. The ‘god in the profes-
sional machine’ is dragged, kicking and screaming, into the full glare of public ex-
posure and its symbolic trappings stripped away to reveal something much closer
to human beings in all their frailties and failings. But this, potentially, creates seri-
ous problems for professional authority insofar as it its claim to ‘special status’
over and above its claims to expert technical/functional expertise is stripped-
bare of its key legitimating identifier – that is, its unique capacity to resolve the
moral and ethical dilemmas which professional practice necessarily entails. If pro-
fessional authority – as the paradigm case of expert authority – is reduced to its
technical/functional effectiveness, then securing and retaining all forms of expert
authority becomes much more problematic in an environment where a ‘low trust’
dynamic seems to have become the dominant social, political, and cultural reality.
Insofar as the independent, self-regulating professional occupation and the in-
stitutionalization of exclusive specialist knowledge and socio-technical practices on
which its legitimacy rested has become the exemplar of expert authority, then it
must be critically reviewed and re-evaluated at a time when the ideological and
material pre-conditions on which it depended have been destabilized and trans-
formed. This is not something which has happened overnight; indeed, it is more
appropriately viewed as a long-term process in which several structural and dis-
4 Conclusion
19

cursive changes have coalesced to form a ‘critical juncture’ within which the cogen-
cy and viability of the established theoretical model of expert authority is increas-
ingly open to question.
As the forthcoming chapters will demonstrate, white-collar, middle-class pro-
fessionals, technocrats and managers – what Galbraith (1967) called the ‘corporate
technostructure’ – find themselves increasingly subjected to the levels of job inse-
curity, ubiquitous organizational control and low-trust workplace relations once
the preserve of working-class, blue-collar workers. Elite groups of experts within
the established professions, central governmental regimes and global corporate
technocratic networks have managed, so far, to insulate themselves from the
worst excesses of the new disciplinary regimes routinely experienced by middle
and lower-level personnel. However, they are also beginning to ‘feel the heat’
from encroaching employment market insecurity and technological/organizational
rationalization in ways that eats away at the liberal public service social contract
between ‘them’ and ‘us’, consequently undermining the institutionalized trust on
which their authority had once been legitimated. The more they strive to insulate
themselves – in both non-work and work settings (Bishop 2009) – from the rest of
us, the more isolated and remote they become, reigniting and reinforcing populist
critiques of socially remote and economically privileged ‘elites’ who no longer de-
serve our trust and support in exchange for the vital public services they suppos-
edly provide. In turn, this populist critique of expert authority has gained increas-
ing political traction as it reveals the social reality of a ‘meritocratic society’ in
which core norms such as ‘equality of opportunity’ are exposed as ideological mys-
tifications for the social reproduction of elite privilege and power (Sandel 2020;
Frank 2020).
In a hyper-competitive, deregulated and low trust political economy and soci-
ety, expert authority is now regularly exposed to levels of social critique and polit-
ical suspicion previously unknown to those groups who claim it. They can no lon-
ger bask in the luxury of political, economic and cultural support from within
governmental, corporate and media elite circles, nor in the certainty of automatic
or ‘passive trust’ from those that continue to depend on their services but with es-
calating levels of distrust and dissatisfaction.
In the next three chapters of this book, we provide an exposition and evalua-
tion of the three analytical narratives – based on the conceptual building blocks
outlined in the previous section of this introductory chapter – that have chal-
lenged, to varying degrees and intensities, the theoretical and empirical sustaina-
bility of the Neo-Weberian model of expert authority as a form of legitimate dom-
ination based on a stable structural alignment between ‘epistemic exclusion’ and
‘jurisdictional closure’ as exemplified in modern professional associations and oc-
cupations.

Chapter 1: Theorizing Expert Authority

Chapter 2: Delegitimation
1 Introduction
Of the three narratives reviewed in this book, ‘de-legitimation’ provides the most
pessimistic, even ‘existential’, evaluation of the current condition of and prospects
for expert authority. This is the case insofar as it signals a fundamental breakdown
in the institutionalized ‘trust relationship’ between experts and those whom they
serve, while signposting a future developmental trajectory in which attempts to re-
pair the former are doomed to fail.
If the legitimation of expert power – and its subsequent transmutation into
‘expert authority’ – rests on a generalized acceptance of its pivotal contribution
to the ‘greater good’ and public wellbeing within society, then the de-legitimation
narrative insists that the structural, ideological and political preconditions neces-
sary for this transformation to occur no longer exist. It advances a set of argu-
ments and supporting evidence which contend that these necessary preconditions
have been decimated by a ‘critical conjuncture’ of systemic changes fatally under-
mining the former’s credibility and sustainability.
In short, the de-legitimation narrative supports the view that expert authority
is in the throes of a ‘legitimation crises’ from which it is highly unlikely to recover
in anything like its established form as outlined in the previous chapter. Consid-
ered in this way, the crisis in expert authority is interpreted as a key element of
a wider, macro-level crisis in liberal democracy and capitalist modernity which
is deracinating the economic, political and social foundations on which such a
form of authority was once established and reproduced.
This narrative draws on, broadly speaking, neo-Marxist and neo-Weberian the-
oretical traditions in political economy and sociology to generate a substantial
body of literature which, analytically and historically, locates the crisis in expert
authority as an institutional expression of a deeper, systemic crisis in the overarch-
ing structures and relations through which modern capitalist accumulation and its
governance are sustained (Habermas 1976, 1985; Jessop 2008, 2016; Schneider et al.
2017; Streeck 2014, 2016; Levitsky and Ziblatt 2018; Runciman 2019; Scott 2020; Vor-
mann and Weinman 2021; Müller 2021).
Consequently, the de-legitimation narrative analytically focuses on the exoge-
nous structural changes generating a systemic crisis in the institutional architec-
ture and normative infrastructure through which contemporary capitalism and
its supporting state regimes are legitimated and reproduced. The crisis in expert
authority is interpreted as an integral feature of this wider implosion of authority
structures in contemporary capitalism and liberal representative democracy gen-

erated by the extreme and unrelenting pressures imposed on them by exogenous
changes in economy, polity and society. In this way, the de-legitimation narrative
rejects the more optimistic and pragmatic assessments of those researchers and
analysts operating within the ‘decomposition’ narrative (reviewed in chapter 4).
They have failed to appreciate the scale and significance of the transformation
that contemporary capitalism and liberal democracy are undergoing and the exis-
tential threat it poses to established forms of expert authority.
Following the analytical framework developed in the previous chapter, this
chapter proceeds to identify the structural changes which are transforming con-
temporary capitalism and liberal democracy, followed by a discussion of the me-
diating mechanisms through which they are selected and interpreted, concluding
with an evaluation of their substantive outcomes for established forms of expert
authority.
2 Structural Changes
As previously indicated, the de-legitimation narrative offers a transformative,
rather than adaptive or incremental, account of why and how expert authority
is being attacked in ways that irrevocably tear-up and destroy, root-and-branch,
its normative foundations and institutional integrity. It identifies a systemic break-
down of collective trust and belief in the moral foundations of the economic, po-
litical and social relations through which modern capitalism and its regulatory
order are maintained such that a tsunami of epistemological and ethical ‘nihilism’
threatens to engulf whatever remnants of scientific rationality and procedural jus-
tice are left in a world dominated by ‘might is right’ (Mair 2013; Davis 2018; Apple-
baum 2020; Davies 2020a; Geoghegan 2020). Insofar as ‘organized irresponsibility’
(Beck 1999; Tooze 2021) – that is, a systemic disregard for the escalating levels of
global, national and local risk and instability created by ‘organized economic
and political power’ on the part of both public and private authorities – becomes
the dominant ethos of ruling elites, then experts are relatively powerless to do any-
thing about it. The technocratic dream of a world in which ‘intractable questions of
ethics [and politics] become matters of expert judgement’ (Gray 2007:106) has mu-
tated into a nihilistic nightmare in which nobody and nothing is to be trusted as a
source of dependable knowledge and belief as a basis for ‘going on’ in ways which
accommodate divergent, and often conflicting, values and interests. Instead, the
Hobbesian vision of a ‘war of all against all’ beckons as the ‘new normal’ in a polity
where the ‘rules of the game’ decay and the groups expected to uphold them re-
treat into their gated communities safe in their conviction that they can withstand
whatever mayhem results (Bishop 2009; Müller 2021), whereas the ‘left behind’ are
22
Chapter 2: Delegitimation

expected to fend for themselves as best they can as ‘strangers in their own land’
(Hochschild 2016).
Thus, the de-legitimation narrative identifies a ‘critical conjuncture’ between
changes in several ‘system-critical domains’ which generates a system-wide trans-
formation in authority structures and their strategic role in managing socio-po-
litical order. This ‘critical conjuncture’ is conceptualized as a ‘coming together’ of
a configuration of economic/technological, political and socio-cultural changes
which generates a chain reaction of transformative, rather than incremental, inno-
vation in the core power structures through which societies are organized and
managed. It entails a complex recombination of systemic changes creating an ex-
istential crisis in which established institutions and the overarching pattern of
relations between them are subject to ever-increasing levels of instability and un-
certainty that cannot be contained by the ‘steering mechanisms’ on which modern
capitalist states have normally depended (Babones 2018; Jessop 2016; Guillén 2015;
Kennedy 2016).
In relation to economic/technological changes, the de-legitimation narrative
identifies four interrelated ‘system-critical and system-wide developments: first,
the global diffusion of neoliberal capitalism as the dominant form of economic or-
ganization; second, the ‘fourth industrial revolution’ entailing the exponentially de-
veloping power and influence of new technologies such as AI, big data, robotics
and data harvesting and their destructive impact on the world of work; third,
the rise of what some analysts have identified as ‘surveillance capitalism’ (Zuboff
2019) and others as the ‘surveillance state’ (Strittmatter 2019; Susskind 2020) in
which vastly expanded powers or ‘affordances’ (Susskind 2020) of centralized, re-
mote monitoring and decentralized, micro level control are made available to rul-
ing groups within private corporations and public bureaucracies; and, finally, the
intensification of ‘distributional conflicts’ between social actors as socio-economic
inequality widens and deepens.
Moving to political/socio-cultural changes, the de-legitimation narrative focus-
es on five linked changes: first, declining ideological and political elite support for
forms of expert power and authority which ‘get in the way’ of ineluctable progress
towards a market society and the crucial role which a reconstructed ‘neoliberal
state’ must play in both advancing and protecting the political process whereby
universal market principles come to dominate all aspects of socio-economic life
(Mirowski 2013; Davies 2014); second, the recrudescence of authoritarian populism
and its rejection of pluralistic modes of interest articulation and coordination;
third, recurring expert failures/scandals and their corrosive impact on public belief
in and support for ‘objective expertise’ as a crucial and trusted source of shared
knowledge and intervention; fourth, the secular decline of the public sphere/sector
under neoliberal policies and programmes driven by marketization, privatization

and deregulation; finally, the perceived rootlessness and remoteness of self-select-
ed and self-reproducing professional/technocratic elites who increasingly remove
themselves from the rest of society.
In the next section of this chapter, we will consider each of these changes in
turn before moving on to a discussion of the mediating mechanisms through
which they are brought together to form carriers of destructive and innovative in-
stitutional transformation.
2.1 Economic/Technological Changes
2.1.1 Neoliberal Capitalism
Several analysts and researchers have identified the ‘disorganizing dynamic’ at the
core of neo-liberalization as it has uprooted the social foundations and dismantled
the structural architecture through which post-1945, neo-Keynesian/neo-Corpora-
tist managerial capitalism was constructed and sustained until the 1980s (Harvey
2005, 2011, 2015; Jessop 2008, 2016; Peck 2010, 2015; Blyth 2013; Ban 2016; Crouch
2016; Swarts 2013; Schneider et al. 2017; Streeck 2014, 2016). Streeck (2016: 14 – em-
phasis in original) identifies this ‘disorganizing dynamic’ at in the following terms:
Contemporary capitalism, then, would appear to be a society where system integration is crit-
ically and irredeemably weakened, so that the continuation of capital accumulation – for an
intermediate period of uncertain duration – becomes solely dependent on the opportunism of
collectively incapacitated individualized individuals, as they struggle to protect themselves
from looming accidents and structural pressures on their social and economic status.
Under-governed and under-managed, the social world of the post-capitalist interregnum, in
the wake of neoliberal capitalism having cleared away states, governments, borders, trade un-
ions and other moderating forces, can at any time be hit by disaster.
However, he also notes that the destructive force of neoliberal capitalism – as evi-
denced in the systemic disintegration of the ‘system stabilizers’ that defined post-
war, managerial capitalism and the overall system breakdown which this generat-
ed – is regarded as ‘historical progress towards individual liberty and a free soci-
ety’ (Streeck 2016: 15) by political and economic elites occupying dominant posi-
tions within neoliberal political economies and their ‘ideological cheerleaders’.
In this way, the dismantling and weakening of the managerial structures and reg-
ulatory regimes through which post-War coordinated capitalism was stabilized and
steered – what Jessop (1994: 13–37) summarizes as entailing the hollowing-out of
the welfare state and its replacement with a neoliberal workfare state – sets in mo-
tion a process of institutional destabilization and social dislocation which threat-
ens all those who, actually or potentially, stand in its way. The latter can be iden-
24
Chapter 2: Delegitimation

tified with a number of interrelated structural changes and strategic policy shifts
directly associated with the emergence and development of neoliberal capitalism
since the 1980s such as: the rapid deregulation of the financial sector and the
increasing power of ‘finance capital’ (Cahill and Konings 2017; Lapavitsas 2013;
Vogl 2017); long-term austerity-driven economic policy and programmes generating
much higher levels of unemployment or ‘underemployment’ and socio-economic
inequality (Blyth 2013); the transference of public power to large-scale private cor-
porations and the marketization of public services which resulted (Hurt and Lip-
schutz 2016); the imposition of a system of ‘private government’ in which state and
corporate power are fused into one and transferred to non-accountable domains
in which public scrutiny is very difficult, if not impossible, to realize (Brown
2015; Anderson 2017); and the emasculation of public bureaucracies by undermin-
ing their statutory independence and diluting their organizational autonomy by
drastically reducing the quality of their employees’ employment conditions
(Malin 2020; Newman and Clarke 2009).
Cumulatively, these structural changes and policy shifts fundamentally alter
the balance of power between ‘capital’ and ‘labour’ in favour of the former such
that neoliberal capitalism becomes, at least potentially, ‘a victim of its own suc-
cess’. By routing its opponents in both the economy and civil society (trade unions,
local governments, social movements etc.,), neoliberal capitalism has removed, or
at least drastically weakened, any effective sources of ‘countervailing power’ (Gal-
braith 1967) to its rule. Yet, its victory leads to increasing levels of economic in-
equality and deprivation, intensified distributional conflicts, and rising levels of
socio-political dislocation and rootlessness which may be uncontainable within
anything resembling ‘democratic due process’ and a gradual but unmistakable
shift towards much more authoritarian and populist forms of governance. Indeed,
the latter have the potential to slow, if not reverse, many of the structural trans-
formations entailed in the emergence and reproduction of neoliberal capitalist po-
litical economies insofar as they reject the modernizing and globalizing thrust in-
herent within them in favour of a much more traditional and nationalistic outlook.
2.1.2 Fourth Industrial Revolution
Alongside the ever-accelerating process of ‘creative destruction’ unleashed by over
four decades of neo-liberalization – driven by an ideological vision and political
project determined to impose market discipline in every nook and cranny of
socio-economic life – a new configuration of informational and social technologies
emerged over this period which further destabilized the normative and structural
architecture through which expert power and control were legitimated. Traversing
a wide spectrum of innovative and exponentially advancing technologies, encom-

passing social media, data mining and extraction, robotics, and artificial intelli-
gence, this ‘fourth industrial revolution’ seems to dovetail with neo-liberalization
to constitute an existential threat to a form of expert authority based on claims
to exclusive, indeterminate, objective, and specialized knowledge putatively ‘be-
yond the reach of non-experts or machines’ (Susskind and Susskind 2015; Susskind
2020, 2022; Crawford 2021; Johannessen 2020; Ford 2021). Not only this, but the com-
bination of free market zealotry and socio-material technologies geared to ‘massi-
fied individualism’ and ‘surveillance capitalism’ pushes conventional, state-centric
politics and the established professions and technocrats on which it depends for its
routine administrative functioning even further on to the margins of socio-political
life (Zuboff 2019; Benanav 2020). In their place, a new cadre of management con-
sultants or ‘calculative experts’ emerges to take over the key strategic positions
and operational roles once occupied and performed by professional administra-
tors, scientists and technocrats who are no longer deemed to have ‘history on
their side’ (Raco 2013; Eyal 2019; Sturdy, Wright and Wylie 2016; Sturdy and O’Ma-
honey 2018; Malin 2020). Indeed, the former can be seen as constituting an infor-
mal ‘shadow elite’ supporting their political masters occupying formal positions of
authority within a streamlined neoliberal state apparatus and simultaneously win-
ning out on the jurisdictional power struggles occurring within established admin-
istrative and professional hierarchies (Wedel 2011, 2014; Reed 2018; Heusinkveld
et al. 2018). Johannessen (2020: foreword) summarizes the key ‘power shift’ gener-
ated by the fourth industrial revolution as entailing an economic and political po-
larization between an exclusive elite of ‘innovation and knowledge workers’ enjoy-
ing the material and social benefits once taken-for-granted by professional staff
and an expanding ‘precariat’ of insecure, marginalized and alienated workers:
Robots will have destroyed bureaucratic hierarchies and torn apart the middle classes. What
will remain is contract workers with insecure jobs … slightly further into the future, we can
see a major transformation in professional environments. Doctors will be medical engineers;
nurses will be nursing assistants accompanied by robots. Teachers will be replaced by robots
and holograms … the Fourth Industrial Revolution will decimate the middle classes.
However, there is more than a hint of technological and historical determinism in
this kind of analysis, which is mirrored in the, at times almost messianic, ontolog-
ical and epistemological commitments to be found at the analytical core of neolib-
eralism as a political ideology and project. The latter seems best articulated as a
theoretical hybrid of economic determinism and social constructionism which
seems incapable of recognizing the philosophical and political contradictions bare-
ly contained by its ideological patina of ‘individualized individualism (Mirowski
2013; Davies 2014 Springer 2016; Streeck 2016; Cahill and Konings 2017). Neverthe-
less, the combination of exponentially unfolding economic, political and technolog-
26
Chapter 2: Delegitimation

ical disorganization generated by successive waves of neo-liberalization and auto-
mation since the 1980s is very likely to have ‘fateful consequences’ for institution-
alized forms of expert authority exemplified by the established professions, senior
civil servants, scientists and other members of the top echelons of the once dom-
inant social democratic state.
As Crawford (2021: 217) reminds us, there is nothing particularly new or inno-
vative about technologies such as AI and robotics. Building on Hardt and Negri’s
(2019) distinction between ‘abstraction’ and ‘extraction’ in neoliberal/informational
capitalism – that is, between ‘abstracting away the material conditions of produc-
tion, while extracting more information and resources’ – she proffers an analysis
of AI stressing its critical role as an industry that integrates technology, capital and
power in much deeper and more inscrutable ways than earlier forms of capital
accumulation. By accelerating and deepening the global ‘disorganizing dynamic’
at the core of neoliberal capitalism, the AI industry abstracts and distances itself
from the economic and political imperatives which drive it through the promulga-
tion of ‘discourses that support its aura of immateriality and inevitability’ (Craw-
ford 2021: 217). In so doing, it also obscures the underlying shift of power and au-
thority away from, at least partially, accountable public officials, professions and
technocrats towards private elites and corporations who engage in a form of ‘hy-
brid rule’ as ‘the state harnesses the private sector and generates a new pattern of
state-capital or government-business relations that redefine our understanding of
political authority and power’ (Hurt and Lipschutz 2016: 3).
Crawford’s identification of the indelible link between globalized neoliberal
capitalism and AI is supported by Ford’s (2021) analysis of robotics and its role
in advancing AI as a disruptive and dislocating technology vastly expanding the
surveillance capabilities of both corporations and states (Pasquale 2015). He also
suggests that organizational roles requiring relatively high levels of creative, com-
plex and coordinating knowledge and skills may have some degree of protection
from the ‘rationalizing and downsizing’ impact of these new technologies. Howev-
er, they are unlikely to escape unscathed. Indeed, the likelihood of these, relatively
privileged and protected, knowledge/expert workers finding themselves enrolled
within advanced control systems and governance regimes even more pervasive
and intrusive than anything experienced under managerial capitalism is very
high. In an age when ‘super-intelligent machines’ pose an emerging, if still some-
what ‘futuristic, existential threat to even the most creative and complex organiza-
tional roles (Ford 2021; Susskind 2020) – particularly in a political environment
where ‘transparency’ and ‘regulation’ are viewed by neoliberal political and eco-
nomic elites with deep suspicion if not disdain – then the downgrading, if not elim-
ination, of these roles to subordinate ‘technical’ and ‘supervisory’ functions located
outside the organization’s core labour market is an ever-present threat.

Beyond the workplace, other commentators (Gurri 2018; Amoore 2020; Daub
2020) highlight the complex ways in which globalized social media has under-
mined the authority of established expert elites in the eyes of the general public
and advanced the political causes of, mostly right-wing, authoritarian populist
leaders and regimes. By challenging any claims to truthfulness, rational analysis
and objective knowledge – especially that claimed by institutionalized forms of
expertise in government and public service more generally – and encouraging
widespread disbelief in ‘public authority’, those organizations and groups who
own and control globalized digital platforms have created a public sphere in
which a ‘culture of nihilism’ becomes more evident. As Daub (2020) suggests, the
communitarian politics initialling shaping the development of social media has
been highjacked by a ‘libertarian counterinsurgency’ dismissive of governments
and experts who do not, indeed cannot, understand the driving forces behind neo-
liberal capitalism and their ‘entrepreneurial champions’ such as Peter Thiel, Egon
Musk and Richard Branson. Rather than leading to a transformation, even tran-
scendence, of modern capitalism into something called ‘hyper-capitalism’, the com-
bination of neoliberal capitalism and the ‘fourth industrial revolution’ have accel-
erated and replicated the power dynamics on which capitalist exploitation always
depended. But they have done this in even more authoritarian and anti-democratic
forms profoundly unwelcoming to anything and anybody representing publicly ac-
countable ‘expert authority’.
2.1.3 Surveillance Capitalism/State
As they become structurally aligned, neoliberal capitalism and the fourth industri-
al revolution can be seen to generate a new configuration, indeed fusion, of eco-
nomic and political power in which greatly expanded surveillance technologies
and their associated governance regimes gradually replace the formalized bureau-
cratic control systems typical of managerial capitalism.
Zuboff (2019) analyses these developments as entailing the move to a form of
‘surveillance capitalism’ in which the ‘Big Digital 5’ (Apple, Google, Amazon, Micro-
soft and Facebook) have created a new and unprecedented mode of accumulation
and surveillance through four interrelated mechanism or processes: first, the dis-
covery and manipulation of ‘behavioural surpluses’ (the traces we leave behind)
into surveillance products/assets sold to advertisers; second, the translation of
the latter into surveillance revenues through the construction of ‘prediction facto-
ries’; third, using AI to generate even more accurate prediction products by fore-
casting what users will feel, think and do; and finally, the trading of these predic-
tion products on ‘behavioural futures markets’ not limited to advertisers, This
28
Chapter 2: Delegitimation

regime of behavioural surveillance and commodification is then imitated by many
second and third tier digital corporations.
She further contends that this move to ‘surveillance capitalism’ has been made
possible through two, interrelated, structural transformations uniquely favourable
to its emergence and advancing dominance: first, the capture of the US governmen-
tal machine by neoliberal economic and political elites no longer committed to the
‘checks and balances’/’countervailing power’ model of governance accepted by
post-1945 governing elites as they become more fragmented and factionalized (Miz-
ruchi 2013), while moving toward a more confrontational mode of economic and
political governance in which ‘winner takes all’ at a global and national level (Gir-
idharadas 2018); second, the suspension of previously accepted and normalized
democratic rules and constraints on government action legitimated by the ‘war
on terror’ released by the aftermath of the 9/11 attack and the sharp tilt to exclu-
sionary and intrusive surveillance regimes that it encouraged. Levitsky and Ziblatt
(2018) proffer a wider analysis of this shift to more authoritarian modes of gover-
nance as exemplified in Trump’s administration and the abdication of the Repub-
lican Party in the face of a rising tide of right-wing populism in which the unwrit-
ten rules and constraints within which liberal representative democracy normally
operate are ‘subverted from within’ rather than by a classic coup d’état.
For Zuboff (2019: 100), the commodification of private behaviour made possi-
ble by the pivot towards surveillance capitalism under neoliberal/populist ruling
elites in Anglo-Saxon political economies points towards a future in which ‘market
power is protected by moats of secrecy, indecipherability and expertise … In this
future, we are exiles from our own behaviour, denied access to or control over
knowledge derived by its dispossession by others for others’. The rise of a new ‘cor-
porate feudalism’ under the twin drivers of neo-liberalization and technological
rationalization which Zuboff identifies is anticipated in Wolin’s (2004:588) analysis
of a ‘revolution from above’ in which corporate elites impose a political economy
in which ‘the state and the corporation have become partners in the process; each
has begun to mimic functions historically identified with the other’. Within this
new corporate feudalism – ironically, if not tragically, driven by a political ideology
and economic doctrine meant to release us from the bondage of collectivist feudal-
ism by the creatively destructive forces of unrestrained market competition and
exponential technological change – experts and their expertise become subordi-
nated to massive concentrations of knowledge and power in which ‘powerful pri-
vate interests are in control of the definitive principle of social ordering in our
time … it is the surveillance capitalist corporations that know … It is the compet-
itive struggle among surveillance capitalists that decides who decides’ (Zuboff 2019:
192). Experts are reduced to the level of ‘mechanics’ and ‘fine tuners’ who maintain
and recalibrate the digital machinery which makes surveillance capitalism a ma-

terial and operational reality, but they have little, if any, say in the strategic goals
and underlying productive logic determining how the latter will be used.
Kotkin (2020) also provides an analysis of the ‘coming of neo-feudalism’ in the
form of reconfigured concentrations of wealth, knowledge and power that are
ruled by a new form of aristocracy or oligarchy which has the dominant influence
over the government and culture, while closing itself off from access to all but a
tiny minority through the erection of economic, educational and political barriers
to entry defeating most aspirant candidates. He sees these ruling economic and
technocratic elites in terms set out by Daniel Bell (1960, 1973, 1976, 1999) in his anal-
ysis of ‘a new priesthood of power’ emerging under the driving force of capitalist-
led post-industrialization from the mid-1970s onwards and their advocacy of a new
‘technocratic authoritarianism’ replacing the inherent messy trade-offs of liberal
democracy with a new form of unaccountable ‘rule by experts’ but under the tu-
telage of a remote plutocratic elite. Runciman (2019: 180–201) sees the latter poten-
tially evolving into a ‘new epistocracy’ entailing not rule by mechanics and engi-
neers but by ‘the people who know best’; that is, a ‘net-archy’ (Thompson 2003;
Savage and Williams 2008) in which networks of technical experts in a wide
range of institutional domains find themselves subordinated to the hierarchical
rule of a plutocratic elite who allow the formal trappings of public accountability
to be maintained, while ensuring they don’t get in the way of ‘getting business
done’ in ways which reinforce plutocratic power and control (Davis 2018; Guilluy
2019).
This is also the analytical juncture at which ‘surveillance capitalism’ meets the
‘surveillance state’; the authoritarian pragmatism characteristic of Putin’s Russia
(Belton 2020) or Xi’s China (Strittmatter 2019; Hamilton and Ohlberg 2020) also de-
pends upon the right combination of concentrated economic-cum-technocratic
power and centralized political-cum-social control in order to ensure, as far as pos-
sible, that citizens are intensively monitored and closely watched in all aspects of
their lives. Such a ‘surveillance state’ also facilitates an ‘elite kleptocracy’ in which
a system of elite stealing and expropriation becomes so pervasive and dominant
that ‘everyone [becomes] hostage to the system’ (Belton 2020: 498), from the pluto-
crats and oligarchs who are the powerbrokers of the overall system to the techno-
crats and professionals who provide the technical expertise required to keep it
functioning. While the underlying institutional logics of surveillance capitalism
and the surveillance state may differ considerably in relation to their ‘system im-
peratives’ – that is capital accumulation and private appropriation as opposed to
political domination and social control – they both demand that expert authority
is subordinated to the dictates of ruling elites who are driven by their determina-
tion to reproduce the structure of power relations through which their rule is pro-
tected and to sustain the vast economic rewards it generates for them.

Chapter 2: Delegitimation

2.1.4 Distributional Conflicts
Yet, neoliberal capitalism, technological rationalization and the rise of surveillance
capitalism/state have not had everything their own way. Resistance, individual and
collective, disorganized and organized, sporadic and sustained, has been evident
throughout their evolution over the last forty years or so. But the ‘creative destruc-
tion’ wrought by neo-liberalization, automation and the advance of surveillance
capitalism/state has been so disruptive and dislocating as to make collective, organ-
ized and sustained resistance to the imposition of neoliberal rule and governance
extremely difficult to mobilize and maintain.
As Streeck (2014, 2016) has maintained, the combination of neoliberal capital-
ism and technological rationalization have had the cumulative effect of reducing
growth rates, increasing socio-economic inequality, steepening levels of public
and private indebtedness, enhanced reliance on a pumped-up money supply
through continuous quantitative easing and intensified competition between
states, corporations and regions have cumulatively generated more severe ‘distri-
butional conflicts’ and widespread cynicism as to the capacity of governments to
manage them. In place of the ‘give and take’ bargaining between vested interests
and the ‘deal making’ characteristic of neo-corporatist intermediation and mana-
gerial capitalism, neoliberal capitalism entails ‘substituting modern co-operative
problem-solving by experts for old-fashioned class conflict’ (Streeck 2016: 23). De-
mands for ever increasing ‘labour market flexibility’ and the precarious forms
of employment which such policies inevitably promote leads to increasing division
and conflict between and within social classes and status groups such that the mit-
igating and moderating influence of the ‘checks and balances’ enjoyed under social
democratic governance and coordinated modes of capital accumulation are denud-
ed of their restraining influence.
Expert occupational groups and organizations are very much ‘part and parcel’
of this intensified distributional conflict created by the destructive dynamic under-
lying neo-liberalization and its embrace of more openly class-based and confronta-
tional modes of conflict resolution. In many respects, they are located at the ful-
crum of the latter to the extent that they provide the expert labour required to
design, operate and administer the expert systems on which neoliberal capitalism
increasingly relies, while constituting a highly significant financial cost and organ-
izational risk to its corporate owners and controllers (Raco 2013; Leicht 2016; Stur-
dy,Wright and Wylie 2016; Spencer,Voulgaris and MacLean 2017; Reed 2018). Organ-
ization-level research has also suggested that middle-ranking experts constituting
the occupational core of the ‘corporate technostructure’ (Galbraith 2007) are will-
ing to engage in forms of workplace resistance which are directed at creating
and defending physical, mental and social ‘spaces’ in which more communal
and collective modes of action can flourish – even in the face of the individualizing
2 Structural Changes
31

and fragmenting dynamic which drives neo-liberalization (Fleming and Spicer
2007; Currie et al. 2012; Newman 2013; O’Reilly and Reed 2011; Reed and Wallace
2015; Courpasson, Younes and Reed 2021). These conflicts often revolve around is-
sues related to the standards and quality of work that expert workers wish to see
protected against the worst ‘deskilling’ and ‘de-professionalizing’ impacts of eco-
nomic and technological rationalization. They also relate to expert workers roles
as ‘knowledge brokers’ and the leverage this still gives them in intra-organizational
political processes focused on strategic decision-making over new markets, prod-
ucts, technologies and performance regimes.
Although neoliberal corporate bureaucracies have significantly reduced the
autonomy and power of expert workers through economic marketization, techno-
logical rationalization and organizational surveillance, this does not mean to say
that pose no risk, indeed threat, to the dominance of ruling economic and political
elites. The prevailing mode of institutional and organizational governance emerg-
ing under neoliberal capitalism entails a hybridization of ‘private’ and ‘public’
power in which a novel configuration of relations and practices aimed at bringing
these two orders or worlds into alignment sit rather uneasily together. Expert
workers continue to play a vital role in ‘making the hybrid happen’ (Reed and Wal-
lace 2015) to the extent that they are simultaneously the agents driving such a proc-
ess on, but they are also expected to provide the vital co-ordinating and integrating
expertise when hybridization threatens to overwhelm neoliberal corporate bu-
reaucracies, in both the public and private sectors, with unmanageable uncertain-
ty, complexity and chaos. Thus, the hybrid rule which becomes dominant under
neo-liberalization also becomes more and more ambivalent, vague, disconcerting
and disorienting for those subject to its bureaucratic complexities and uncertain-
ties and those expected to make it work in the face of the latter. As Hibou (2016:76)
concludes, neoliberal bureaucratization articulates and redefines the contradic-
tions, tensions and conflicts which lie at the organizational core of neoliberal gov-
ernance, but they do this in such a way as to impose even more pressure and stress
on expert workers to make them work without the normative, regulative and po-
litical steering mechanisms on which co-ordinated/managerial capitalism could
depend when ‘the going gets rough’. Expert workers now occupy the organizational
spaces in which the contradictory forces released by neo-liberalization collide,
spaces in which they can carve-out some degree of autonomy and control, but
only if they continue to provide the co-ordinating and integrating expertise
through which the destruction and chaos inherent within the former can be at
least mitigated and contained, if not exculpated.

Chapter 2: Delegitimation

2.2 Political/Socio-Cultural Changes
As previously indicated, the de-legitimation narrative identifies five key political/
socio-cultural changes which, when aligned with the economic/technological
changes discussed in the previous sections of this chapter, irreparably undermine
expert authority. This seen to be especially case when the ‘mediating mechanisms’
through which these changes have been interpreted and implemented – as re-
viewed in the latter sections of this chapter – are seen to be incapable of recogniz-
ing, much less ‘making good’, the destructive impact of neo-liberalization on the
normative and structural pre-conditions on which the legitimation of expert
power and control has been based under the established neo-Weberian model out-
lined in the previous chapter. These five key political/socio-cultural changes can be
summarised as entailing ‘elite withdrawal’, ‘authoritarian populism’, ‘expert fail-
ure’, ‘public service decline’ and ‘expert secession’.
2.2.1 Elite Withdrawal
Streeck (2016: 35–37) suggests, that social orders only implode when their ruling
elites are no longer prepared to do the hard work necessary to sustain them. If
true, then those researchers and analysts supporting the ‘de-legitimation narrative’
insist that this is exactly what has occurred under the governance regimes im-
posed by neoliberal economic, political and cultural elites who have carried
neo-liberalization forward since the late 1970s/early 1980s in Anglo-American polit-
ical economies (Harvey 2005; Peck 2010; Peck and Theodore 2015; Leicht 2016;
Springer 2016; Davis and Williams 2017; Busch 2017; Nichols 2017; Vogl 2017; Cahill
and Konings 2017). At the core of the neo-liberalization process and project lies
the ideological and political imperative of reconstructing the capitalist state in
ways that ‘purge it’ of any remaining neo-corporatist/social democratic traces or
residues and remaking it in the light of an unerring commitment to the universal-
ization of market principles that know no boundaries or limitations as to their un-
qualified application and guaranteed success (Davies 2014, 2018; Dardot and Laval
2013; Smets et al. 2017). Market competition and the economic discipline it imposes
must become the dominant institutional logic pervading all spheres of social life.
Consequently, the neoliberal state must play the central political and administra-
tive role in ensuring that government policies and programmes become carriers of
this market logic and that nothing must be allowed to compromise, much less con-
test, its realization right across the ever-expanding spectrum of economic, social
and cultural domains in which such a state must encompass. As Gamble (2009,
2014) so brutally and eloquently expressed it, ‘a free market needs a strong
state’ and that state must have the political will and administrative capacity re-
2 Structural Changes

quired to remove any and every obstacle that stands in the way of realising the
ideological nirvana of a ‘market society’ (Frank 2001, 2020).
No matter how compromised these hard ideological principles, and their
emergent political logic may become under the grinding pressures and tensions
of everyday governing in political economies subject to recurring crises and fail-
ures (Peck 2010; Davies 2014), they identify where potential opposition may located
and how it is to be dealt with by those ruling elites charged with making the neo-
liberal state an organizational and administrative reality. Expert authority – and
those groups deemed to be carriers of the legitimate powers and capacities
which it gives them – are always likely to be treated with suspicion, if not con-
tempt, by ruling neoliberal elites because they are deemed to embody an institu-
tional logic of independent, or at least quasi-independent, ‘professional’ autonomy
and control ideologically resonant of the social democratic/neo-corporatist state
and the support it gave to their self-governance and management. This is, and
will always be, a source of deep political concern for ruling neoliberal elites and
their remaking of the modern capitalist state because ‘professional experts’, or
for that matter any experts not under the effective control and direction of such
a state, remain a potential and powerful source of opposition and contestation
to the untrammelled imposition of market-driven policies and programmes. What-
ever form ‘embedded neoliberalism’ takes in different countries, regions or local-
ities at different historical periods (Swarts 2013; Cahill 2014; Peck and Theodore
2015; Ban 2016), the power, authority and status of professions and professionals
are a potential source of countervailing interests and values to those prioritized
by neoliberal governance regimes if they cannot be incorporated within the sur-
veillance technologies and administrative systems on which the latter depend to
secure the former’s acquiescence, if not commitment.
Indeed, as several scholars have noted (Peck 2010; Mirowski 2013; Swarts 2014;
Davies 2018, 2020; Reed 2018), ruling neoliberal elites have a ‘schizophrenic’ atti-
tude towards the modern nation state and the experts on which it depends for
its strategic steering and operational viability; on the one hand, they are extremely
suspicious, almost paranoid, about the power of state-supported professionals, of-
ficials, technocrats, scientists, and mangers to frustrate and even undermine the
neo-liberalization project by indirectly and subtly blocking and slowing its prog-
ress and momentum; on the other, they are acutely aware of their dependence
on these strategically-located expert groups to ensure that neoliberal ideology is
translated into state-backed policies and programmes which are practically sus-
tainable and politically effective.
This simultaneous ‘hate/love’ relationship between ruling neoliberal elites and
the public/private experts and their expertise on which they have to rely to get the
neo-liberalization project moving as a deliverable set of policies and programmes
34
Chapter 2: Delegitimation

means that they have implemented a series of ‘state make-overs’ in which the lat-
ter comes to resemble, as far as possible, the neoliberal ideal of a private business
corporation in relation to its corporate culture, structure and systems. Thus, a run-
ning series of neoliberal state reforms – such as ‘new public management’, ‘private
finance initiative’, ‘public-private partnerships’, ‘internal markets’, ‘performance
management’, ‘competitive outsourcing’, ‘continuous auditing’, ‘entrepreneurial
leadership’ and ‘extra-judicial regulation’ – have been undertaken over the last
four decades or more across a range of Anglo-American political economies with
the aim of ensuring that the administrative apparatus of the neoliberal state
and the ‘calculative/corporate experts’ who run it remain committed to the impo-
sition of competitive market discipline in all areas of socio-economic life (Du Gay
2005; Moran 2007; Wilks 2013; Raco 2013; Swarts 2013; Peck and Theodore 2015; Ban
2016; Eyal 2019 ; Reed 2019; Malin 2020; Plehwe, Slobodian and Misrowski 2020).
What we are seeing here is a gradual but persistent ideological and political
withdrawal of neoliberal elite support for established forms of ‘professional’ ex-
pert authority and the occupational groups legitimating their power and control
around the indispensable role they play in delivering an ideal of ‘public service’
which is no longer recognized or valued by the neoliberal state, While the social
democratic state and its ruling elites broadly supported the growing power, author-
ity and status of professionals, technocrats, experts and managers because of their
functional indispensability, collective responsibility and technical reliability, neo-
liberal state elites have no qualms about placing the latter in a much more
‘arm’s length’ relationship and subjecting them to a wide-range of intrusive and
demeaning surveillance and control regimes having little or no time for ‘due proc-
ess’ or ‘professional autonomy’.
This withdrawal of neoliberal elite ideological and political support for expert
authority has major implications for professionalized modes of occupational con-
trol and social closure. So, it is worth reiterating Larson’s (2013: xii) argument that:
Professions ultimately depend on the power of the state, and they originally emerge by the
grace of powerful protectors. The privileged position of a profession is thus secured by the
political and economic influence of the elite which sponsors it … an account of the process
by which professions emerge illuminates the fact that professions gain autonomy; in this pro-
tected position, they can develop with increasing independence from the ideology of the dom-
inant social elites … The fact remains, however, that their privileges can always be lost.
Larson may be developing her argument on the state-delegated and removable na-
ture of professional power and authority, but this is true of ‘expert authority’ in
general (Johnson 1994). Insofar as political, administrative, legal, and social elites
acting in the name of the state remain the ultimate source of ‘authorization’ for
those individuals and groups claiming such a status in relation to their expertise
2 Structural Changes
35

as an occupation, trade or skill, then they remain dependent on the former’s con-
tinuing ideological and institutional support. Nevertheless, this sponsorship and
support can always be withdrawn, particularly in a socio-historical context in
which a new cadre of state elites remain profoundly suspicious of those forms
of established expert authority which obstruct, dilute, or even oppose the disciplin-
ing force of unrestrained market competition. More than four decades of neo-lib-
eralization has generated a very different economic, political and cultural environ-
ment in which multiple forms of expert authority – and especially professional
authority – now find themselves exposed to state elites claiming to represent
the interests of individual customers and users – or even more powerfully, ‘the
people’ – against the self-interested interests and powers of elitist expert cartels.
Indeed, the emergence of ‘mutant’ strains of neoliberalism – forming hybrid
ideological combinations of libertarianism, communitarianism, nationalism and
technocracy – have been identified by a growing number of researchers as they
plot the rise of more ‘authoritarian populist’ neoliberal political regimes exchang-
ing globalism for ‘autarky’ and national self-reliance (Hurt and Lipschutz 2017; Cal-
lison and Manfredi 2020; Bickerton and Accetti 2021; Vormann and Weinman 2021;
Reed 2022).
2.2.2 Authoritarian Populism
The recrudescence of a more ‘authoritarian populist’ ideological, political and eco-
nomic strain of neoliberalism – as the latter ‘mutates’ in response to a changing
global, national and regional environment in which accepted orthodoxies seem
to be consistently overtaken and undermined by events (like a global financial cri-
sis in 2008/9 and world-wide pandemic in 2020/21!) – has been tracked and traced
by scholars researching ‘populism’ over the last decade or so (Müller 2016, 2021;
Judis 2016; Mudde and Kaltwasser 2017; Fieschi 2019; Moffitt 2020). However,
other researchers have argued that this ‘authoritarian turn’ in populist ideology
and politics is by no means ineluctable and argue for a more progressive, ‘cen-
tre/left’ version that is supportive of more egalitarian and democratizing policies
(Srnicek and Williams 2015; Mouffe 2018; Frank 2020). Either way, the recent rap-
prochement between neoliberalism and populism creates a potent ideological and
political mix from which new and innovative governance regimes emerge that
pose major challenges, not to say threats, to all forms of expert authority and
those groups, organizations and movements claiming to exist and act in the
name of their expertise.
Much like neoliberalism, populism is inherently distrustful and critical of
those claiming authority based on their specialist expertise and its crucial role
in protecting ‘the public’ against a wide range of threats to its wellbeing. By elevat-
36
Chapter 2: Delegitimation

ing the latter above the primacy of ‘the market’ or ‘the people’, claims to expert
authority threaten the unitary ideologies on which neoliberalism and populism
rest by admitting a plurality of, often contradictory and conflicting, interests and
values which cannot be easily accommodated within a monotheistic view of the
world in which ‘money’ or ‘folk’ constitute the one ‘true god’ (Frank 2001). In
this respect, both neoliberalism and populism are ideologies which are anti-elitist,
anti-pluralist, anti-liberal and pro-moralistic in their political ontologies in that
their commitment to ‘the will of the people’ refuses to acknowledge the possibility,
indeed probability, that their symbolic construction and interpretation of the latter
will be contested by other political epistemologies (Müller 2016, 2021). As unitary
social constructionists (Mirowski 2013; Müller 2021), both neoliberals and populists
find it very difficult, if not impossible, to admit to the existence of political ontol-
ogies celebrating diversity, difference and debate because this fundamentally con-
tradicts their belief that only they have direct access to ‘real people’ and their ‘real
needs’.
Thus, the emergence of a mutant form of ‘populist neoliberalism’ entails
‘double jeopardy’ for expert authority because it’s much more authoritarian ideo-
logical strains and their implications pose a double-edged threat to the latter; any
sources of expert authority not prepared to accept the policies and programmes of
political regimes speaking in the name of ‘populist neoliberalism’ literally become
‘the enemy’ and, as such, deserving of contempt and ridicule because of their un-
willingness, or inability, to see the error of their ways.
Neoliberalism is an inherently complex, dynamic and unstable political doc-
trine and practice whose ‘ideological fault-line’ lies at the point where its ‘libertar-
ian’ and ‘authoritarian’ strains come into direct contact and struggle to establish
their dominance (Hurt and Lipschutz 2016; Frank 2020; Callison and Manfredi
2020; Vormann and Weinman 2021; Reed 2022). While the libertarian strain has
been dominant since the emergence of neoliberalism as a governing ideology
and practice promoted and enacted by political, economic and social elites from
the late 1970s/early 1980s, the authoritarian strain has become stronger over the
last decade or so as national political leaders have attempted to exploit economic
and political crises and the growing sense of unease, anxiety and rejection which
they generate (Fieschi 2019; Moffitt 2020; Applebaum 2020; Müller 2021). This au-
thoritarian strain combines populism and nationalism to legitimate a communitar-
ian political ideology and a package of economic policies and programmes geared
to improving the material and social conditions of ‘real people’ overlaid with an
exclusionary and polarizing culture of identity politics in which multinationalism
and multiculturalism are rejected as fatally undermining communal traditions and
values.
2 Structural Changes
37

The recent ideological and political pivot towards an ‘authoritarian populist’
strain of neoliberalism is extremely bad news for all forms of ‘expert authority’;
it polarizes ‘the people’ against ‘the experts’ by rejecting the legitimacy of the latter
as entailing false claims to superior intellectual and technical capabilities at the
expense of making ‘ordinary people’ seem incompetent and incapable of making
decisions for themselves. As Frank (2020: 250–254) puts it, populist egalitarianism
seeks ‘to undermine [professional] elites by making ordinary people capable’ and
by refusing to accept the meritocratic doctrines through which expert hierarchies
are legitimated and reproduced (Sandel 2020). By disempowering ordinary people
by making them unable to function without their expertise, experts become an in-
tegral, if not essential, part of a ‘conspiracy against the laity’ undertaken by elite
ruling groups to ensure that their political, economic and social dominance is se-
cured – even in crisis situations where their authority may be directly challenged
by events and circumstances beyond their control.
This anti-meritocratic ‘turn’ in the ‘authoritarian populist’ mutation of neolib-
eralism is often, counterintuitively, combined with a technocratic logic of contem-
porary democratic politics in which hybridized forms of ‘techno-populism’ come to
dominate the latter across a wide range of historical and geographical contexts
(Bickerton and Accetti 2021). By claiming to legitimate modes of political represen-
tation through appeals to both technical competence and popular mobilization,
techno-populist discourses and movements/parties politicize expertise in ways
which unavoidably challenge the independence and neutrality of established social
democratic/corporatist state bureaucracies and professional associations. The lat-
ter cannot sustain claims to embody, directly and incontrovertibly, the ‘will of
the people’ and/or the ‘right to govern’ because they are compromised, if not taint-
ed, by their intimate links with and dependence on ruling elites who are more
than happy to manipulate and betray ‘the people’ in furtherance of their unearned
wealth and power. On the other hand, authoritarian/populist political movements
and parties are more than happy to concentrate power and control around a rel-
atively small cadre of ‘experts’ who are trusted to carry forward their long-term
strategy and objectives because the latter are appropriately imbued with its ideo-
logical mission and governing mentality. Yet again, we see, an admittedly fragile
and unstable, fusion of putatively opposed political ideologies/discourses and or-
ganizations which broaden and deepen the attack on established modes of expert
authority based on claims to ‘competence’ and ‘objectivity’ accumulated through
protracted education and training accredited by independent occupational bodies
and state institutions.
Such an authoritarian populist challenge to the legitimacy of expert authority
is likely to become even more protracted and acute in a context where repeated
38
Chapter 2: Delegitimation

and escalating ‘expert failure’ becomes more socially visible and politically inde-
fensible.
2.2.3 Expert Failure
Scepticism over the capacity of ‘elitist experts’ to deliver on their promises to keep
us safe, secure and satisfied has widened and deepened as trust in ‘expert systems’
wanes as a result of recurring failures to predict, control and manage the risks and
uncertainties we face as individuals and communities (Hanlon 2016; Koppl 2018;
Hopkin 2020). This accusation of recurring ‘expert failure’ resonates with the ideo-
logical and political inclinations of an increasingly populist and authoritarian
strain of neoliberalism in which market fundamentalism and cultural nationalism
come together to challenge the meritocratic credentialism of experts.
We seem to have come an awful long way since theorists of ‘reflexive
modernization’ predicted a future in which expert systems come to ‘de-contextual-
ize’ and ‘dis-embed’ our lives through steering mechanisms entailing ‘the evacua-
tion of the traditional or customary content of local contexts of action and the re-
organizing social relations across broad time-space bands’ (Beck, Giddens and Lash
1994: 85). While accepting that such a future would inevitably involve ‘living in a
world of multiple authorities’ and the potential for some groups to become ‘disen-
chanted with all experts’ (Beck, Giddens and Lash 1994: 86–87), such theorists
were confident that pre-modern, traditional and communal cultures rejecting ex-
perts, expertise and expert systems would be unable to resist the globalizing
and ‘de-traditionalizing’ dynamic inherent in modernization. However, it is those
very traditional and communal cultures and ideologies which seem to have
come back to haunt us as we struggle to navigate our way through a succession
of crises in which the reality of ‘expert performance’ falls far short of what experts
have led us to expect.
As Beck insists (Beck 1999), living in a ‘risk society’ necessarily means that we
become more dependent on the expert systems through which the, exponentially
increasing, risks endemic to such a society are managed and mitigated in ways
which we usually don’t understand and indeed don’t want to understand. If they
work, then we are happy for them to ‘go about their business’ without needing
or wanting to bother too much about how they work or what we do when they
show increasing signs of failing to function in the usual way. Indeed, experts
seem more than happy to allow us to maintain our collective state of ‘blissful ig-
norance’ if it protects them from intrusive interference from an increasingly
self-aware and critical public. However, in a situation where the effectiveness of
those very expert systems through which dangers and threats, often of an existen-
tial kind as in the case of a pandemic or climate collapse, seems to be rapidly wan-
2 Structural Changes
39

ing and, even worse, they come to be viewed as ‘risk enhancing’ in their own right,
then these escalating systemic failures add ‘ideological fuel to the flames’ of those
who denounce expert authority as a charade masking the vested interests and
prejudices of remote and uncaring ruling elites.
In this way, escalating critiques of and attacks on expert authority become en-
rolled in what Hopkin (2020) calls ‘anti-system politics’ – that is, an attack on a way
of doing politics combining liberal market economies and social democratic gov-
ernments in which experts adjudicate between conflicting interests and values
to produce workable compromises supportive of a progressive status quo. This ‘pol-
itics as usual’ system, and the key role which experts play in sustaining it, is seen
to have failed to protect most citizens against the economic disorder and social dis-
location unleashed by over four decades of neo-liberalization because it is geared
to reproducing itself rather than changing things in ways that benefit the majority.
Experts are now viewed as key operators within state systems and organiza-
tions failing to protect the general welfare of most of their citizens since they are
driven by a technocratic imperative to impose ‘scientific’ systems of knowledge on
unequal and divided societies which cannot be ‘made whole’ by their ministra-
tions. They cannot but fail to deliver on the vastly inflated expectations placed
upon them – and which they have also positively encouraged as part of their ‘mo-
bility strategy’ – because their claimed expertise has been found seriously wanting
in the face of the frighteningly complex problems and crises we now face. Indeed,
they increasingly pose a threat to the survival of ‘popular democracy’ as they be-
come more deeply embedded as a ‘shadow elite within a deep state’ that has near
monopoly access to and control over expert advice which no longer addresses the
everyday concerns of common people (Koppl 2018).
Thus, across a broad spectrum of biological, ecological, medical, social and
cultural domains, ‘politics as usual’ – in which experts play the key role of ‘honest
brokers’ bringing opposing positions into some sort of practical alignment as a
basis for ‘moving forward’ – is no longer viable as a way of responding to ‘disinte-
grating institutions’ (nuclear families, labour markets, nation states), ‘manufac-
tured uncertainties’ (pollution, poverty, over-population) and ‘environmental cri-
ses’ (pandemics, species extinction, recessions). Ultimately reassuring ‘expert
narratives’ about our collective capacity to cope with the existential threats
which these ‘new realities’ present seem increasingly unconvincing in a world
where their stories are perceived as self-interested, contradictory and technocrati-
cally-driven (Beck 1997, 1999). In a world where ‘hazards themselves sweep away
the attempts of institutional elites and experts to control them’ (Beck 1999: 150),
the ‘risk assessment bureaucracies’ in which so many experts now seem to hide
away from their failures to predict and contain the escalating threats which con-
front us seem riper than ever for downsizing, merging and even culling.

Chapter 2: Delegitimation

This is even more true at a time when ‘public services’ and the ‘public domain’
in general have been in serial decline as neoliberalism and populism cut into their
ideological capital and cultural support seemingly without fear of political cost or
electoral retribution.
2.2.4 Public Service Decline
As public services have been ‘hollowed out’ by the marketization, financializa-
tion, and outsourcing dynamic driven by several decades of neo-liberalization
(Raco 2013; Wilks 2013; Bowman et al. 2014; Bowman 2015; Anderson 2017;
Brown 2019), so the authority and status of the established professionals who pro-
vide those services has been in decline (Newman 2013; Reed 2019; Malin 2021; Wal-
lace et al. 2023). Emerging cadres of ‘calculative experts’ or ‘corporate professio-
nals’ have been incrementally positioned with key roles within marketized and
outsourced public services in order to ensure that the policy priorities and pro-
gramme directives of neoliberal state elites dominate organizational decision-tak-
ing (Raco 2013; Eyal 2019; Christensen 2017; Reed 2018; Sturdy, Wright, and Wylie
2016; Malin 2021).
This rising cadre of calculative/corporate experts design and manage the new
organizational technologies whereby the political, financial, and performance im-
peratives imposed by neoliberal state elites are translated into appropriate opera-
tional targets and plans. They incrementally displace the ‘old guard’ of public serv-
ice professionals who are no longer trusted to subordinate their expertise and
skills to the requirements of a new regime in which deregulated markets becomes
the ultimate arbiters of value and worth. Indeed, established public service profes-
sionals are increasingly seen as potential obstacles to, if not subversive of, this new
calculative and judgemental regime insofar as they refuse to accept their subordi-
nate position within the latter and continue to contest its allocative priorities and
distributional outcomes. Malin (2021: 209) summarizes this process of devaluing,
displacing and de-professionalizing public service professionals in the following
terms:
Neoliberalism, involving a remaking of the state, reconfigured to serve the demands of cap-
ital, has meant some professionals may have lost their authority because the state has lost its
authority. Instead of celebrating the virtue of professional expertise, a system based on neo-
liberal ideas tends to view profession as a raw material within a general commodification
process. … [A]cross areas of the public sector there has been a loss of autonomy in professio-
nal practice.
This general commodification of professional expertise and the dilution of expert
authority and autonomy – based on liberal/social democratic state norms of ‘serv-

ice to the public’ and their embeddedness within a wider cultural matrix of values
associated with communal wellbeing through collective agency – which it necessa-
rily entails, can be understood as part and parcel of a wider macro-economic shift
towards ‘rentier capitalism’ in which ‘rent-seeking’ becomes the dominant econom-
ic driver to be facilitated and protected by the neoliberal state. Christophers (2020)
analysis of ‘rentier capitalism’ suggests that, viewed in a wider socio-historical con-
text, the re-emergence of this neoliberal-led form of capitalist political economy
can be seen as the revitalization of an old/new ‘dominant bloc’ within contempo-
rary elite power structures in which the interests of landed aristocracy/property
and global financial conglomerates come together to prioritize ‘profit making
and capital accumulation through the holding of assets’ rather than from sustained
increases in productivity through technologically and organizationally enhanced
human labour. In the Anglo-American economies, such as the UK, US, Canada, Aus-
tralia and New Zealand, there has been a common ‘revivification of finance’ under
neo-liberalization and a much more pronounced process of deindustrialization
since the early 1980s in which ‘rentierization’ has been the dominant structural
trend. Leading corporations have become ‘rentiers’ in which economic rents de-
rived from control over exclusive assets, rather than from investing in new tech-
nologies, training, and organizations in order to achieve long-term increases in
the productivity of their employees’ labour, becomes the driving force for strategic
decision making over the allocation of large-scale resources.
Moving to ‘rentier capitalism’ under neo-liberalization has entailed fateful
consequences for the public sectors of the Anglo-American political economies
to the extent that ‘outsourcing’ public services to private business corporations
has emerged as one of the, if not ‘the’, dominant mechanism through which corpo-
rate control over exclusive assets and the long-term rents/profits to be derived
from it has been realized. Christophers (2020: chapter 5) detailed analysis of ‘out-
sourcing and contract rents’ right across diverse sectors such as health, education,
care, welfare, crime, construction and governing documents a process in which
‘fake competition’ becomes the new unstated rule and corporate providers an
emerging ‘shadow state’ of unregulated and unaccountable rentier capitalists
(White 2016). These ‘impenetrable organizations’ not only seal themselves off, as
far as is possible, from external scrutiny and transparency, but they also subject
their employees – and particularly those employees occupying expert and mana-
gerial roles generating and assessing information concerning the corporations’
performance and impact – to much more extensive and intensive surveillance re-
gimes. Professional/expert labour, like any other forms of labour under rentier cor-
porations, is squeezed, casualized and controlled, because it, in part, is the ration-
ale for outsourcing and because rentier institutions and organizations thrive on
42
Chapter 2: Delegitimation

near monopoly power in which any relatively expensive and problematic resource,
such as expert labour, must be exploited like any other exclusive asset.
Thus, the institutional logic on which neo-liberalized rentier capitalism thrives
demands that expert work and the workers performing it become embedded in a
matrix of power relations – which at the organizational level can be identified as
‘neoliberal new public management’ (NPM) (Reed 2019) – in which exclusive dom-
ination over and control of all assets by those corporate elites acting on behalf of
it becomes the norm. The latter are empowered to sweat and exploit the assets
which the former generate – esoteric specialized knowledge, scarce technical
skills, complex managerial technologies, and informal tacit understandings –
under rentier capitalism because it ensures that vast unearned rental income
and profits are maximized and sustainable. As Crouch (2016: 68–69) puts it, the
neoliberal form of ‘new public management’ (NPM) (Reed 2019) which has become
dominant under rentier capitalism ‘converges on an attack on the idea of public
service professionalism and its associated ethic … subjecting a professional activity
to market discipline means stripping away ethical inhibitions in the cause of in-
creased profitability’. In this way, neoliberal NPM under rentier capitalism has a
corrupting influence over the generation and application of professional knowl-
edge within public services in which the distinction between, ‘public value’ and
‘private interest’ effectively collapses to legitimate corporate profitability as the
only criteria for assessing the performance of public institutions and organiza-
tions.
This does not mean to say that public service professionals have simply ‘rolled
over’ in the face of the new managerial technologies through which marketized
and outsourced public services have been neo-liberalized at the level of service or-
ganization and delivery. Even under the latter, public service professionals play a
critical role in ‘keeping the show on the road’ when the congenitally ‘failing for-
ward’ dynamic that neo-liberalization consistently reproduces (Peck 2010) also gen-
erates all sorts of damaging fallout which only they can pick-up and rectify (Bu-
chanan et al. 2007; Kirkpatrick et al. 2005; Currie and White 2012). This ‘repair
and recovery work’ in which public service professionals are routinely engaged in-
evitably opens institutional niches and organizational spaces which they can, and
do, exploit in the furtherance of their own values and interests which often run
counter to what neoliberal NPM regimes may be striving to impose of them (New-
man 2013; Reed and Wallace 2015; Reed 2018). Professional service logics and ex-
pert values/practices are not eradicated by neoliberal NPM under rentier capital-
ism but, to a considerable extent, they do ‘go underground’ and are forced to adapt
to the dominant market-driven managerial logic which the latter regime legiti-
mates and proscribes as the solution to ‘bureaucratic inertia’ and ‘professional

sclerosis’ prevalent under social democratic forms of managerial/stakeholder cap-
italism.
Overall, the long-term decline of the concept of the ‘public sector/service’ as
entailing a distinctive institutional logic and form in which a wide range of ex-
pert occupational groupings, encompassing professionals, scientists, administra-
tors, and managers, work on behalf of the general wellbeing of society as a
whole and the extremely diverse communities that it encompasses has meant a
fundamental weakening of the legitimacy of expert authority across swathes of
contemporary public life. But arguably, expert workers have made matters even
worse through the ‘secessionist’ strategies in which they have engaged, often in re-
sponse to the depredation of the public service ethos and the exalting of private
interest, both within and without the contemporary workplace.
2.2.5 Expert Secession
Müller (2021: 20–41) deploys the concept of ‘secession’ to identify the process
whereby the most privileged groups within contemporary Anglo-American politi-
cal economies and those expert groups designing, building, and operating the phys-
ical infrastructures and technical systems sustaining them spatially insulate and
socially isolate themselves from the larger societies in which they exist. Indeed,
he argues there has been a ‘double secession’ through which elites ‘are to retreat
from any real dependence from the rest of society. Not everyone of them literally
lives in a gated community, but the underlying trends of ‘self-sorting’, and homog-
enization in wealthy enclaves are clear enough; the well-educated and the well-off
marry each other, live one another, and reproduce many of their privileges over the
generations’ (Müller 2021: 22–24). This ‘first secession’ becomes a ‘double or invis-
ible secession’, Müller contends, when elites and their expert cadres undertake var-
ious structural and cultural strategies to exclude disadvantaged groups from effec-
tively participating in the political decision-making processes through which key
choices impacting on their lives are taken and legitimated. These strategies can in-
clude a raft of options making it much more difficult for, an already alienated and
insecure body of people within the wider economy and society, to vote, to plan for
their or their children’s futures, or to access basic health, welfare, and educational
services.
As Müller (2021) also concedes, many of those expert occupational groups lo-
cated within an ‘increasingly stressed middle’ will find it difficult to maintain their
economic security, social status, and cultural standing in the face of technological
and organizational rationalization which threatens livelihoods and identities. Yet,
the seemingly resilient positions occupied by an upper-middle class of professio-
nals, managers, and technicians – who support the economic, political, and social
44
Chapter 2: Delegitimation

elites who have benefited most from neo-liberalization and rentier capitalism –
proffers a powerful aspirational example for those located in the middle echelons
of the expert occupational hierarchy to follow and imitate. This reinforces the ideo-
logical and political power of authoritarian populist leaders and parties who wild-
ly oscillate between condemnation of ‘metropolitan elites’ and support for them
once they begin to follow what seem like policies and programmes grounded in
nationalist autarky and monocultural exclusion.
Müller’s (2021) identification of the ‘double secession’ in which expert elites
have been routinely engaged in recent years has been supported by Bishop’s
(2009) analysis of the demographic restructuring through which increasingly
socio-economically homogenized communities have emerged in the US over the
last thirty years or so and Mandel’s (2020) interpretation of the complex ways
in which ‘meritocratic credentialism’ has come to be the ‘last acceptable prejudice’
surreptitiously legitimating a ‘success ethic’ which is self-confirmatory and justifi-
catory for upper-middle class professionals and middle-middle class technocrats
alike.
Bishop (2009) historically tracks and contemporaneously documents the eco-
nomically and politically driven demographic transformation which the US has
undergone during the last three decades which has drastically reduced social
and cultural diversity, while emaciating political life to a Hobson’s choice between
two equally unacceptable ideological tribes. Building on Florida’s (2003) research
on the rise of the creative class in the US since the 1960s/70s, Bishop identifies
the ‘big sort’ as a long-term demographic process through which high-wage expert
workers in communications, engineering, education, and entertainment have clus-
tered in socially homogenized demographic groups, primarily located in high tech
city-regions, through migratory movements transforming the country’s social land-
scape. This creative class of expert workers have driven the geographical and social
mobility whereby communities have been ‘sorted’ into segregated and homogen-
ized groups who no longer have any shared, collective sense of their identities
and futures. In turn, these demographic and socio-economic transformations
have generated various cultural shifts in which division and polarization, rather
than unification and consensus, have come to dominate contemporary politics in
which a growing ‘populist backlash’ against educationally and culturally derived
power and status has gathered political momentum and force (Frank 2020).
Sandel (2020) focuses on the ideological and political resources which the cre-
ative class, both in the US and other capitalist political economies, have drawn-on
to legitimate the economically and socially advantageous positions which they have
come to occupy, and even treat as a ‘natural right’, under an increasingly segregat-
ing and polarizing set of socio-economic structures. As they have reshaped the
demographic/urban landscape in ways that secure and protect their material

and social advantages from external competition and challenge, so expert occupa-
tional groups have become increasingly dependent, ideologically and politically, on
‘meritocratic credentialism’ as the crucial legitimating device through which ‘the
professional classes have figured out how to pass their advantages on to their chil-
dren, converting the meritocracy into a hereditary aristocracy’ (Sandel 2020: 119–
120). Once seen as a route for economic advancement and upward social mobility,
credentialism becomes an exclusionary mechanism and justificatory rationale for
elite professionals and middle-ranking expert groups determined to ‘seal-off ’ their
positions and privileges from ‘uncontrolled accesses’ from lower order groups who
may attempt to usurp their power and authority.
No wonder authoritarian populist leaders and movements have found their
attacks on ‘cosmopolitan elites’ such fertile ideological and political soil when
the latter are seen to corrupt the ideal of ‘meritocratic credentialism’ in such a bla-
tant and consistent manner.
3 Mediating Mechanisms
As discussed in chapter one, the configuration of structural changes reviewed in
this chapter do not impose themselves on social actors in a deterministic manner.
They are mediated and interpreted through a range of mechanisms which provide
the relational forms and discursive modes through which the ‘messages’ which
they contain are organized and carried. These mediating mechanisms constitute
socio-material hybrids through which structural change is translated into organi-
zational realities which need to be ‘acted on’ in various ways. They simplify and
filter structural change in ways that prioritize and justify certain ‘translations’
rather than others so that they become the dominant interpretive frameworks
through which individual and collective action is legitimated. Yet, their stabilizing
and legitimating role is always open to counter arguments which contest the dom-
inance of established orthodoxies to some degree or another.
Within the de-legitimation narrative, three, interrelated mediating mecha-
nisms are identified which are seen to play a pivotal role in shaping the structural
and discursive context in which the crisis in expert authority must be understood
and explained. First, the rise of a neoliberal state which replaces the core ‘steer-
ing capacities’ associated with the social democratic/neo-corporatist state and its
emphasis long-term economic planning and administrative co-ordination through
centralized bureaucratic management. Second, the emergence of a radical indi-
vidualist political ideology and discourse legitimating the policy regimes and pro-
grammes mobilized by a neoliberal political elite who effectively control the state
structures and systems through which the latter are pursued. Third, the increasing
46
Chapter 2: Delegitimation

political power and cultural influence of hybrid or ‘mutant’ political discourses
recombining selected elements of radical individualization and authoritarian pop-
ulism which promote ‘individual resilience’ and ‘communal restoration’ as the
basis for national success and collective protection in a violent and disordered
world.
As Mirowski (2013: 56, emphasis in original) reminds us, ‘a primary ambition
of the neoliberal project is to redefine the shape and functions of the state, not to
destroy it. [Neoliberals] are inclined to explore new formats of techno-managerial
governance that protect their ideal market from what they perceive as unwanted
political interference’. These new formats of techno-managerial governance are le-
gitimated as entailing ‘shrinking the state’, but the political and administrative re-
ality is of modes of quasi-market-based regulation which are bureaucratically
more complex and unwieldly than anything they have replaced.
Jessop (2008, 2016) argues that the neoliberal state and the techno-managerial
modes of governance that it legitimates and authorizes involves the emergence of a
‘strategic-relational approach’ in which the ‘Keynesian Welfare State’ (KWS) gives
way to a ‘Schumpeterian Workfare State’ (SWS) ideologically driven by the political
imperative to eliminate, systematically and structurally, any alternative state ca-
pacities and modes of policy making and implementation standing in the way of
neo-liberalization (Jessop 1994). In addition, the SWS relies on a complex configu-
ration of relational power networks through which political and economic elites
work to ensure, as far as they possibly can, that a neoliberal policy regime in
which market liberalization and the extensive bureaucratic apparatus which it re-
quires – now extensively outsourced to private sector corporations rather than ‘in-
sourced’ by public sector agencies – remains ‘on track’. These relational power net-
works give the semblance of decentralization and delegation, but they mask the
political and administrative reality of sustained concentration of state power
and control within a formally streamlined governance apparatus. Within these re-
lational power networks, certain groups of technical and organizational experts –
like management consultants and a whole army of ‘corporate professionals’ – may
play an important role in ensuring the effective functioning of the new modes of
regulation emerging under the neoliberal/SWS state. Yet, their role as ‘technicians’,
‘fixers’ and ‘brokers’ is subsumed within a wider governance structure in which
they remain under the control and direction of the political, economic and admin-
istrative elites ensuring that neo-liberalization continues to unfold, even when, in-
deed particularly when, it seems to falter and fail (Peck 2010; Peck and Theodore
2015; Springer 2016).
The ‘strategic-relational state’ emerging under neo-liberalization is supported
by a ‘radical individualist’ political ideology and discourse in which the collectivist
forms of individualism that dominated the post 1945 social democratic welfare
3 Mediating Mechanisms
47

state are progressively denigrated and dismantled (Streeck 2016; Bevir 2016; Cooper
and Szreter 2021). This ideological paradigm shift occurs through the incremental
intellectual seeding and political imposition of an individualist/libertarian value
system in which market-based competition between ‘rational actors’ driven to
maximize their rewards in a Hobbesian/Darwinian ‘struggle of all against all’ be-
comes the universal analytical and ethical template against which all forms of ‘gov-
erning’ are to be evaluated and legitimated (Dardot and Laval 2013; Davies 2014;
Brown 2015, 2019). Individuals are ideologically cut adrift from a supportive wel-
fare state which is effectively disempowered of its critical role in protecting
them when they are at their most vulnerable and exposed to the full disciplinary
force of unrestrained market competition. Instead, they must learn to become re-
silient in the face of such challenges and threats to their livelihoods, indeed exis-
tence, by psychologically accepting and internalizing the mental strength and skills
required to pursue, ruthlessly and unbendingly, their self-interests within a strug-
gle for survival in which ‘everybody is reduced to fending for themselves’ (Streeck
2016: 40). But this dismantling and disempowering of ‘collectivist individualism’
and the socio-political institutions and governance regimes through which it was
legitimated must be made to look as if it is the outcome of ‘spontaneous necessity’
rather than of intentionally planned and calculated political intervention on behalf
of the elite economic and political interests for which it is enacted and sustained.
As Cooper and Szreter (2021) suggest, the ‘collectivist individualism’ which under-
pinned the Keynesian Welfare State did not implode in on itself as a result of un-
derlying, impersonal structural forces un-connected to all and any form of socio-
political agency. Instead, it succumbed to a ‘virulent’ form of extreme libertarian
individualism propagated by neoliberal economic, political and cultural elites –
and their ‘media cheerleaders’ – over several decades who constituted a governing
coalition or bloc determined to overturn the ideological orthodoxies underpinning
the post-1945 social democratic consensus from which the ‘expert classes’ had
benefited so much materially and socially.
However, and particularly of late, libertarian individualism has not had every-
thing go its own way. Indeed, the more recent ‘authoritarian turn’ in neoliberal
ideology and political discourse signals a growing unease with the single-minded
pursuit of unrestrained market rationality and the re-emergence of neoliberal-
ism’s ‘pathological tendencies.’ Several analysts (Babones 2018; Callison and Man-
fredi 2020; Vormann and Weinman 2021; Bickerton and Accetti 2021; Reed 2022)
have argued that the authoritarian/populist strain within neoliberal ideology has
become more discursively active and politically impactful in recent years as the lat-
ter has mutated in response to worsening economic and social conditions within
advanced political economies since the financial crisis of 2008/2009 and the auster-
ity policy regimes which dominated the following decade. As this, inherently unsta-
48
Chapter 2: Delegitimation

ble and fragile, ideological hybrid of libertarianism, authoritarianism and technoc-
racy has gathered political momentum, so its impact on the organization and func-
tioning of the neoliberal state has intensified.
This has entailed strengthening the power of the executive arm of government
at the expense of the legislative arm, as well as concentrating the capacity to di-
rect and control policy making and implementation within a centralized adminis-
trative apparatus dominated by a ‘state party’ and its elite supporters within big
business and other leading sectors of the economy and society (Jessop 2016:
222–237). Enhanced executive power and single party dominance is reinforced
by a weakening of the authority of the judiciary and its pivotal role in upholding
the rule of law as populist leaders are empowered to speak and act on behalf of
‘the people’s will’ or ‘protecting national interests’- particularly in crisis situations
calling for immediate and drastic government action unencumbered by democrat-
ic probity or legal restraint.
Thus, the re-emergence of the authoritarian/populist strain within neoliberal
ideology has reinforced the idea that ‘technicians, experts and professionals can
replace professional politicians’ (Bickerton and Accetti 2021: 56). It has also, simul-
taneously, ‘demobilized professional knowledge workers whose empowerment
threatens the authority of administrators and managers’ (Callison and Manfredi
2021: 18). They, in turn, are only trusted insofar as they continue to act as the tech-
nocratic conduit for populist leaders above the hubbub of party politics and the
confusion it inevitably sows in a naïve and manipulable public.
Experts, like everybody else, become the subjects of an authoritarian/populist
variant of neoliberalism entailing an extremely uneasy ideological partnership be-
tween an ethic of unrestrained individual freedom and remote technocratic rule,
governed by a political elite who claim the right to speak and act on behalf of ‘the
people’ irrespective of democratic norms or legal restraints. As Bickerton and Ac-
cetti (2021: 30, emphasis in original) suggest, authoritarian populism promotes ‘a
politicization of expertise, one that can be used as a legitimizing resource for the
purpose of succeeding within the electoral game itself … the politicization of exper-
tise that comes with rise of a techno-populist logic can result in a conflict with the
expansion of technocratic power associated with depoliticization’. Claims or ap-
peals to technocratic competence or expertise are always subordinated to the
populist ideologies and movements in which they are embedded and from
which they take their political meaning and value. Experts become the servants,
rather than the masters, of the populist political leaders and movements who em-
power them to design the policies, programmes and technologies through which
‘the people’s interests’ will be protected and advanced.

4 Substantive Outcomes
Refracted through the mediating mechanisms of a neoliberal state, libertarian in-
dividualism and authoritarian populism, the crisis of expert authority can be un-
derstood as the outcome of a complex interplay between structural changes and
strategic agency which has irretrievably eroded the legitimacy of expert power
and influence. At its intellectual core, this revolt against expertise is rooted in
deep-seated controversy and uncertainty over the epistemological foundations of
‘true knowledge’ and a growing incapacity to distinguish between ‘fact’ and ‘fiction’
in a world in which populist iconoclasm is valued above consensus-building within
expert communities and between them and the wider publics they serve (Collins
et al. 2020). It’s ‘institutional fall out’ is to be found in the breakdown of the social
structures and political forms through which a diverse plurality of, often contrast-
ing and conflicting, values and interests were previously coordinated and integrat-
ed to form a sustainable consensus over the compromises and ‘trade offs’ necessa-
ry to make it work. This has reinforced the trend towards more concentrated
economic and political power in parallel with a fragmenting and fracturing of ex-
pert jurisdictional work domains and a secular decline in the legitimacy and effi-
cacy of expert-based forms of governing and organizing. As the latter have become
progressively colonized by political ideologies and discourses inherently suspicious
of expert claims to disinterested objectivity and practical efficacy on behalf the col-
lective interests of the communities in which they are embedded, so they have be-
come increasingly subservient to the power and control of the political and eco-
nomic elites who rule in the name of ‘the market’ and/or ‘the people’.
Considered in this way, the de-legitimation narrative documents and inter-
prets a long-term process of socio-historical decline in which the social contract be-
tween experts, society and the state that ideologically sustained and politically ar-
ticulated the social democratic consensus of the post-1945 era has imploded under
the combined pressure of structural change and social agency as it turned the lat-
ter to its advantage in order to destroy the obstacles standing in the way of its vi-
sion of a ‘market society’. For those who adhere to this de-legitimation narrative,
‘there is no way back’ to resurrecting that social democratic consensus and the
three-way stakeholder social contract it legitimated because their moral founda-
tions and institutional infrastructure have both been eviscerated by the cumula-
tive impact of the underlying structural movements and strategic political inter-
ventions documented in previous sections of this chapter.

Chapter 2: Delegitimation

5 Conclusion
In his book, Legitimation Crisis, first published in English in 1976 (Habermas 1976),
Habermas identifies what he sees as an irreparable breakdown in the ‘steering
mechanisms’ which had enabled post-1945 capitalist political economies to manage
threats to their continued operation and reproduction. While the latter had been
relatively successful in developing organizational forms and techniques which
enhanced their capacity to absorb challenges and threats to their continued exis-
tence, these ‘steering mechanisms’ were no longer able to co-ordinate and inte-
grate the complex economic, political, and social systems through which the accu-
mulating problems facing them could be effectively managed and contained. As a
result, the underlying legitimacy and acceptability of advanced capitalism was ex-
ponentially eroding as its capacity to respond to its citizens demands and needs –
for secure employment, decent welfare and housing, educational opportunity for
their children, and the protection of basic human and civil rights – was exponen-
tially weakening under the unrelenting pressure for sustained capital accumula-
tion and corporate profitability.
In particular, the ability of the state under ‘managerial capitalism’, to ‘substi-
tute government functions for market functions’ (Habermas 1976: 51) in ways
that mitigated the worst excesses of unregulated free market capitalism, such as
mass unemployment and increasing poverty, was being questioned as the ‘corpor-
atist modes of interest intermediation’ between business associations, trade union
organizations, and government policy makers was coming under sustained politi-
cal pressure. Even the ‘state-monopolistic capitalism’ which had developed in the
German Democratic Republic in the post Second World War period was undergo-
ing a deep-seated economic and political crisis as its organizational capacity to
manage the systemic contradictions between ‘socialized production’ and ‘market
rationality’ was being openly questioned and critiqued. This displacement of the
fundamental structural contradictions of capitalism on to the state administrative
system had worked for a while, but the latter was increasingly incapable of dealing
with the contradictory ‘steering imperatives’ that it was required to absorb, such
as the need for long-term planning and control set against the requirement for un-
restrained market competition as a precondition for sustained capital accumula-
tion. Repeated failure of the state administrative system to deal with these strate-
gic, steering imperatives was generating an ongoing ‘legitimation crisis’ in which
the political authority and cultural coherence of the former was dissipating as a
result of its inability to produce meaningful and acceptable understandings of
its ‘validity claims’ to act on behalf of the collective interests of the public at large.
Habermas’ book, like all academic texts, was very much ‘a product of its time’
(Milstein 2021: 29). However, it signals a growing awareness, both within the aca-

51

demic/intellectual community and the wider polity and society, that the Keynesian
Welfare State (KWS) ‘had not eliminated capitalism’s crisis tendencies; it merely
displaced them’ (Milstein 2021: 29, emphasis in original). For Habermas, both intel-
lectuals/academics and politicians/publics had seriously over-estimated the capaci-
ty of the modern, post-war social democratic/KWS – and it’s administrative/techni-
cal/expert elites – to transform corporate capitalism into a socio-economic system
in which the imperative need for compromises and trade-offs between the com-
peting demands and claims of a wide-range of stakeholder interests and values
could be ideologically and institutionally embedded within its overarching admin-
istrative architecture and decision-taking processes. Indeed, what we have wit-
nessed in the decades since Habermas’ book was published is how fragile and
weak that social democratic consensus has proved to be in the face of a succession
of economic, political and cultural crises which have undermined its legitimacy
and authority.
In this chapter, we have documented and reviewed what the unravelling of the
social contract between experts, publics, and states has meant for the legitimacy
and authority of expert power in a contemporary world in which ‘financialized’,
rather than ‘socialized’, forms of capitalist political economy have become domi-
nant and have reinforced underlying political and cultural tendencies treating
claims to ‘expertise’ with increasing suspicion and contempt. In many ways, expo-
nents of the de-legitimation narrative build on Habermas’ original analysis of the
inherent weaknesses of the ‘validity claims’ on which the legitimacy of liberal/so-
cial democratic state capitalist systems and the authority of those experts respon-
sible for managing them have proved to be. As they have been even more fully ex-
posed to the instabilities and dislocations generated by intensifying economic
pressures and political demands unfolding since the late 1970s/early 1980s, so
their capacity to deal effectively with the challenges which the latter pose has re-
peatedly failed to live up to expectations (Schneider, Schmidtke, Haunss and Gro-
nau 2017).
For analysts working within this de-legitimation narrative, the long-term dam-
age inflicted on expert authority by the complex conjunction of developments out-
lined in this chapter poses an existential threat which ‘the experts’ are repeatedly
failing to meet. For them, there is no way back to the institutionalized relationship
between experts, publics and states which emerged in the post-war period and
came to frame the wider socio-political context in which expert power could be
confidently legitimated and authorized.
In the following two chapters, we consider narratives which, while accepting
some of the analysis that exponents of the de-legitimation narrative advance,
are not in agreement with their highly pessimistic conclusions. For them, ‘de-legit-
imation’ is a synonym for a process whereby expert authority has been demystified
52
Chapter 2: Delegitimation

in ways which have, eventually, revealed its socio-political reality, or the former
has grossly exaggerated the extent to which the decomposition of the expert divi-
sion of labour necessarily entails the demise of expert authority as it adapts to a
new ecology of expert work.

Chapter 3: Demystification
1 Introduction
Our discussion of the de-legitimation narrative in the previous chapter identifies
an irreversible long-term decline in the legitimacy of expert authority generated
by a sustained erosion of the institutionalized trust on which it had depended
on for its resilience in the face of escalating attacks on and threats to its probity
and veracity. A wide range of structural, political and cultural changes have
come together to form a complex socio-historical conjuncture in which established
expert authority finds itself unable to cope with a ‘perfect storm’ of systemic insta-
bilities and uncertainties eradicating the core institutional foundations on which
its integrity and capability rests.
In this chapter, we review and evaluate an alternative demystification narra-
tive which rejects the theoretical presuppositions informing the de-legitimation
narrative, as well as its analytical scaffolding that frames its account of the ‘the
crisis in expert authority’. Rather than interpret the crisis as an outcome of an
irrevocable breakdown in institutionalized trust and the draining away of the le-
gitimacy which it once provided, this demystification narrative sets out a very dif-
ferent account that progressively strips away the conceptual prostheses and ex-
planatory legerdemain on which the de-legitimation narrative trades. Instead of
assuming that expert authority rests on socially given and ‘naturalized’ trust rela-
tions which automatically bestow legitimacy on expertise and those who claim it,
the demystification narrative removes these artificial theoretical presuppositions
and the explanatory sleight-of-hand which they entail. It analytically positions
and historically locates the ‘political rationalities and technologies’ through
which claims to expertise and the power which flows from them at the very centre
of the discursive practices and organizational processes ‘normalizing’ expert
power and control (Johnson 1994; Dean 1999; Burrell 2006; Miller and Rose 2008;
Davies 2011).
In this way, the demystification narrative identifies a nascent structural deter-
minism and neo-evolutionary functionalism at the theoretical core of both the
de‐legitimation and decomposition narratives (see the following chapter); they
both presume that an underlying ‘institutional logic’ is at work reproducing the
conditions under which expert authority is legitimated. While the de-legitimation
narrative sees the strength and impact of this institutional logic as being fatally
weakened by structural changes undermining its coherence and stability, it still re-
mains blind to the ‘political rationalities and technologies’ that are required to de-
liver and sustain expert authority as a viable mode of organizational governance

due to its myopic analytical focus on ‘sovereign power’ as embodied in the institu-
tional apparatus of the centralized state (Miller and Rose 2008; Jessop 2010, 2016).
Thus, the analytical focus on ‘governmentality’ – that is, the conduct of government
in all its various forms and levels from the most ‘local’ to ‘global’ and the wide
range of ‘political technologies’ through which it is made possible (Burchell, Gor-
don and Miller 1991; Jessop 2010; Brown 2015) – is central to the demystification
narrative as it strives to sensitize us to the innate contradictions and tensions
which expert work necessarily entails.
As Davies et al. (2022) have recently noted in their book on the Covid-19 pan-
demic, Foucault analysed how a new political logic of ‘hygiene’ emerged in the
eighteenth century and the ‘political technologies’ through which its unruly and
disruptive impact was to be contained. A wide range of ‘experts’ also emerged
over the next two centuries – in public health, housing, medicine, law, government
and commerce – whose power and authority flowed from their putative capacity
to design, operate, maintain and recalibrate the political technologies through
which the risks and threats posed by disease, poverty, crime and recession could
be propitiated and contained to maintain social order. They also note that the twen-
ty-first century Covid-19 pandemic generated a wide range of hybrid political tech-
nologies and new forms of expertise required to develop and implement them,
such as more advanced digital surveillance regimes and monitoring systems need-
ed to ‘track and trace’ infectious citizens or, more mundanely but nonetheless sig-
nificantly, the repurposing of hotels to form physical and spatial sites in which the
latter could be contained and confined (the pandemic and the demystification nar-
rative is discussed further in chapter 5 of this book).
In this way, the demystification narrative demands a rigorous analytical
and substantive refocusing on the organizational strategies through which expert
groups design and promote the various political technologies needed to contain so-
cial disorder and the material and symbolic advantages they derive from their po-
sitioning in key nodes of the relational networks of power emerging from the lat-
ter’s implementation. There is no a priori presumption or analytical tilt towards
the institutionalized trust relations through which expert authority is routinely le-
gitimated and reproduced because this is conceptualized as being inherently con-
tested, unstable and politicised by the continuous struggle for power in which its
necessarily embedded. It is only by stripping away these institutional trappings
and discursive ideological mystifications can we begin to understand how claims
to expertise and the power which they authorize are dependent on the develop-
ment of political rationalities and technologies and the forms of knowledge-
based subjugation which they unavoidably entail (Foucault 2003). They are and re-
main socio-historical formulations and instantiations of expert power which may
or may not become sufficiently normalized and stabilized to establish the precon-
1 Introduction
55

ditions under which modes of governmentality congenial to expert authority can
be sustained.
Given these preliminary remarks on the conceptual and theoretical terms on
which the demystification narrative trades, this chapter will proceed on a similar
basis to that developed in the previous and next chapters of this book.
First, we consider the analytical refocusing on endogenous, rather than exog-
enous, changes which have led to the emergence of more openly contested modes
of expert-led governmentality in which ‘the material operations, forms of subjuga-
tion, and the connections among the uses made of local systems of subjugation on
the one hand, and the apparatuses of knowledge on the other’ (Foucault 2003: 34)
are the central explanatory concern. This entails, we suggest, the move to a ‘bottom
up’, rather than ‘top down’, logic of analysis in which attention shifts away from
macro-level systemic or structural changes prioritized by the de-legitimation nar-
rative towards localized forms of political technology and the modes of governmen-
tality which they make operationally possible. ‘Sovereign power’ is analytically de-
throned (Miller and Rose 2008) in favour of a sustained explanatory focus on
the disciplinary networks which expert political technologies make possible
through their capacity to, literally, ‘see into our souls’ and to reconstruct our sub-
jectivities and identities as they do so. It is not forgotten, much less ignored, but it
is not allowed to dominate the analytical frame to the exclusion, or at least mar-
ginalization, of much more mundane, ‘material operations and local subjugations’
as they simultaneously reproduce ‘apparatuses of knowledge’ but in ways that also
stretch them far beyond their original rationales and capacities.
Second, we assess how this fundamental analytical refocusing influences
the demystification narrative’s understanding of ‘neoliberalism’ as a distinctive
mode of governmentality made possible through the mobilization of various inter-
related political technologies and their impact on the everyday processes and prac-
tices through which organizational discipline and population regularisation is
generated (Springer 2016; Brown 2019). Rather than seeing neoliberalism as a dis-
tinctive form of political economy supported by specialized macro-level steering
mechanisms emerging from the breakdown of the social democratic/neo-corpora-
tist consensus from the 1980s onwards, the demystification narrative signals a rec-
onceptualization of ‘neo-liberalization’ as a process or project driven by new
micro-level political technologies as they become propagated within everyday
life and come to govern the terms on which it is lived. Of particular significance
in this context, are the innovative surveillance and accounting technologies where-
by organizational discipline and population regularisation under neo-liberaliza-
tion comes to take on a much more insidious and abstract, but nonetheless ‘nor-
mal’ and ‘routine’, character as they seemingly detach themselves from any kind
56
Chapter 3: Demystification

of anchoring in physical realities and the direct constraints they impose on every-
day existence.
Third, we concentrate on the analysis which the demystification narrative pro-
vides of the role which ‘experts’ play in designing and operating political technol-
ogies through which neo-liberalization can come to have a ‘saturating effect’
(Brown 2019) throughout contemporary societies as they become populated by ‘ne-
oliberal subjects’ who have a very different relationship with the state and its
associated agencies than that envisaged under social democracy (Chandler and
Reid 2016). This is seen to entail ‘a continual process of preventive management
of society, based on the indirect shaping of the adaptive capacities and conduct
of its individual members’ (Chandler and Reid 2016: 81–82) so that their subjection
to society’s requirements, as mediated through the political technologies on which
‘preventive management’ relies, becomes softer, more nuanced, and less brutal
than under older governmentality regimes based on bodily incarceration and
physical punishment including torture and death (Garland 1990).
Here, the ‘governmentality school’ of research on new forms of expertise
emerging under ‘advanced liberal regimes’ has alerted us to the significance of
the role which experts in the social and human sciences play in ‘democratizing’
specialized knowledge and skill in contemporary organizations (Johnson 1994;
Dean 1999; Burrell 2006; Miller and Rose 2008; Davies 2011). At one level, this en-
tails an ‘opening-up’ to external scrutiny, particularly to the discipline imposed on
expertise by new forms of state-mediated regulation in which proxies for market
competition – such as competitive tendering, internal markets, service outsourcing
and performance management – play an increasingly prominent role in subjecting
experts to innovative modes of surveillance and control (Raco 2013; Christophers
2020). Yet, it also involves a weakening of the established formal, legal, administra-
tive and occupational regulative architecture to which expert power and authority
were previously subjected, to the extent that expert authority is marginalized by a
new ‘system of judgement’ in which the state becomes ‘a neutral enforcer of com-
petition, without regard to the consequences’ (Davies 2014: 172).
Finally, and has been the case in the preceding and succeeding chapters of this
book, we will consider what the overall implications of the demystification narra-
tive might be in relation to the key structural and cultural changes which it
identifies, the mediating mechanisms through which they are articulated and ex-
perienced, and the substantive outcomes they produce for experts and their sta-
tus as they become even more tightly integrated into neoliberal modes of govern-
mentality.
1 Introduction

2 Local Subjugation and the Knowledge Apparatus
Drawing extensively on Foucault and the work of the ‘governmentality’ school of
thought in organization studies, the demystification narrative develops a very dif-
ferent understanding of ‘neo-liberalization’ to that offered by the de-legitimation
or decomposition narratives. It suggests that neo-liberalization entails a transfor-
mation in both the way the conduct of governing is carried out and the emerging
relationship between ‘the state’ and ‘the subject’ under neoliberal governance re-
gimes based on this new mode of governmentality (Dardot and Laval 2013; Spring-
er 2016; Chandler and Reid 2016; Brown 2019).
As Miller and Rose (2008) suggest, neoliberal governmentality entails the shift
to a very different form of political rationality and technology to that prevailing
under social democratic/neo-corporatist regimes in which a relatively loose and
fissiparous configuration of state-delegated, and formally non-state agencies, be-
come the primary organizational mechanisms for securing neoliberal rule. In
turn, this entails a political strategy aimed at displacing and marginalizing the
core institutional structures and organizational delivery mechanisms on which
the social democratic state and neo-corporatist interest intermediation depended
– such as a universal health and welfare system and its supporting progressive tax-
ation regimes administered by an independent and autonomous civil service – so
that a new overarching political rationality and governmental technology could be-
come dominant. In Miller and Rose’s terms (2008: 24–25 emphasis added):
[Advanced liberal democracy] seeks to de-governmentalize the state and de-statize practices of
government … it seeks to govern, not through ‘society’ but through the regulated choices of
individual citizens, now construed as subjects of choices and aspirations to self-actualization
and self-fulfilment … as an autonomizing and pluralizing form of rule, this form of rule is
dependent upon the proliferation of little regulatory instances across a territory and their
multiplication, at a molecular level, through the interstices of our present experience.
How does this neo-liberalizing displacement and marginalization strategy work
and what are the conditions under which it proved to be so effective?
Foucault’s work has highlighted a number of different varieties or ‘modalities’
of power (Foucault 2003: 249), which operate on different levels or scales and using
different technologies (Foucault 1980). Foucault notes that in the modern era, two
great technologies of power are in operation: disciplinary power and bio-power.
Biopolitics represents a distinct form of power, concerned with regulating so-
ciety: ‘… the set of mechanisms through which the basic biological features of the
human species became the object of a political strategy, of a general strategy of
power’ (Foucault 2007: 16). In various texts (notably, the History of Sexuality,
Vol. 1 (1980) and his lectures at the Collège de France (2003, 2007, 2008)), Foucault
58
Chapter 3: Demystification

delineates bio-power from the earlier juridical form of sovereign power. Sovereign
power is the ‘right to decide life and death’ (Foucault 1991: 258), where power is
an expression of ‘deduction’ (Foucault 1991: 259), i.e., a repressive power of sup-
pression, deprivation and denial of property, services, even life. Contrasting with
this, this new mode of power, bio-power, emphasises a generative or productive
form of power, oriented towards organising and developing human life. Moreover,
bio-power represents not only a new and distinct form of power but also a distinc-
tive form of government, at the heart of which is concern for social regulation and
individual self-governance. This new form of power does not replace sovereign
power, rather it subsumes it, rendering this power – in the form of law and justice
– one element of a wider set of the apparatus of bio-power (Foucault 1980), with an
emphasis on establishing the norm and normalising. Bio-power represents there-
fore a constellation of techniques of power ‘in which modern human and natural
sciences and the normative concepts that emerge from them structure political ac-
tion and determine its goals’ (Lemke 2011: 33). At the organisational level, ‘biocracy’
(Fleming 2014a, 2014b) emerges where ‘life itself ’ is a key area of exploitation in
the contemporary neo-liberal organization.
Coupled with this, Foucault accounts for the emergence of ‘disciplinary power
and panopticon control’ in which ever-expanding domains of individual and col-
lective life are subjected to political technologies directed to the subjugation of bod-
ies – particularly in rapidly expanding urban areas where the ever-present threat
of social disorder and moral breakdown must be contained (Foucault 2003: 135–
145). Gradually, from the mid-late eighteenth century onwards, the ‘sovereign
power’ of the centralized state apparatus becomes increasingly dependent on
and displaced by more adaptable, agile and accountable political technologies in
prisons, schools, asylums, clinics, workhouses, factories, barracks and hospitals
in which ‘discipline organizes an analytical space’ (Cousins and Hussain 1984:
185). Thus, the emergence and reproduction of ‘disciplinary power’ is made possi-
ble through a complex network of interrelated spatial, temporal, observational and
normative practices whereby internalized self-surveillance and discipline are rou-
tinely secured without the extensive bureaucratic machinery on which the ‘sover-
eign power’ of the centralized state depends for its legitimacy and efficacy. As Mer-
quior (1991: 113) puts it, ‘unlike random sovereign power, which was chiefly
exercised over the earth and its products, disciplinary power concentrated on
human bodies and their operations. So, instead of discontinuous levies, modern
man [sic] got constant surveillance’.
Analysts of neoliberal modes of governmentality build on Foucault’s original
account of disciplinary power and biopower and the political rationalities and
technologies through which it they are made possible as a distinctive form of state-
craft by means which the everyday lives of ‘neoliberal subjects’ can be regulated in
2 Local Subjugation and the Knowledge Apparatus
59

unobtrusive and self-empowering ways (Davies 2011; Bell 2015). This suggests that
neo-liberalization entails a ‘recoding of the place of the state in the discourse of
politics’ (Miller and Rose 2008: 80) where the neoliberal state becomes ‘a decentred
state-at-a-distance’ in which government policies and programmes are refocused
on the ‘personal life’ of the individual consumer/client rather than the ‘public
life’ of the producer/citizen. These neoliberal policies and programmes, as well
as the bio-political and disciplinary technologies through which they are to be re-
alized, ‘promise to create individuals who do not need to be governed by others
but will govern themselves, master themselves, care for themselves’ (Miller and
Rose 2008: 24 see also Foucault 2008). With it, comes the regularizing and normal-
ising of the population (Foucault 1980, 2003, 2007) establishing characteristics and
norms that can then be measured, ranked, and shaped (Lemke 2011) by ‘stressing
desirable outcomes’ (Fleming 2022: 1991). These are also supported by disciplinary
technologies to provide normative expectations of behaviour that are subject to
regular monitoring and control (Hook 2007).
Under these internal transformations, the sovereign power of the social dem-
ocratic state can no longer be relied upon as new political rationalities and tech-
nologies, dominated by neoliberal discourses which ideologically valorise ‘power
without a centre’, come to displace the institutional apparatus on which the former
relied for its legitimacy and relevancy. Since the 1980s, the social democratic sov-
ereign state is transformed from a relatively well-integrated and centralized ad-
ministrative mechanism into an increasingly fragmented and fractured mode of
governmentality entirely dependent on new tactics, technologies and trade-offs
to make and remake ‘neoliberal subjects’ who are practically and emotionally
equipped to cope with the heightened uncertainties and insecurities which they
must face in a ‘market dominated society’. It becomes merely one agency, amongst
many others, now relocated organizationally and discursively within a network of
governmental relations and technologies, which operate without any overall direct-
ing strategic logic but are instrumental in making ‘actors complicit in their own
subjection to rules, norms and practices’ (Davies 2011: 70).
As should be clear by now, the demystification narrative provides an analysis
of expert power and status under neoliberal governmentality that foregrounds
the role of endogenous change in political rationalities and technologies generating
the reconfiguration of discursive and material conditions under which ‘expert au-
thority’ is legitimated. The latter is progressively stripped bare of its sacred and
mystical qualities and socially downgraded into a much more mundane, everyday
legitimacy claim subject to the same ideological struggles as any other claim to spe-
cial status and reward. By deconstructing the neo-Weberian sovereign state as a
unique form of ‘rulership’ whereby military, political and juridical power are in-
tegrated to provide the dominant institutional mechanism through which a legiti-
60
Chapter 3: Demystification

mate monopoly of the means of violence within a geographic area is secured (Jes-
sop 2010; Anter 2014; Fligstein and McAdam 2012), governmentality theorists pro-
vide a radically different understanding of the status and role of the state under
neo-liberalization by redefining it as one agency competing with many others to
claim and control certain areas of activity and resources. Any presumption, analyt-
ical or ideological, in favour of the state as the locus classicus of a Hobbesian ‘sov-
ereign power’ guaranteeing social order against incipient disorder and decay is re-
jected as an abstract, mythical construction unable to comprehend the intricate
webs of discursive and socio-technical power defining the neoliberal world (Davies
2011; Springer 2016). Over forty years of neo-liberalization has left us with a very
different form of ‘disciplinary’ and ‘bio’, rather than ‘sovereign’, power in which
the conduct of government requires political rationalities and technologies aligned
with the new realities of deregulated market competition, hollowed-out public
services, private sector corporate control and government policies and pro-
grammes directed at retraining an often recalcitrant and obdurate workforce
(Hurt and Lipschutz 2016; Callison and Manfredi 2020; Vormann and Weinman
2021).
Both the role and status of ‘experts’ under this neoliberal governmental re-
gime also become much more contested and problematic as the ‘reflected glory’
which they once enjoyed as technocratic ‘public servants’ to a sovereign state
wane quite dramatically. They are now under constant pressure ‘from above’ –
from political, economic and administrative elites to deliver on whatever promises
they are making to their populations – and ‘from below’ – from populaces who feel
increasingly remote from and excluded by those very same public servants who
are supposed to be their technocratic saviours.
However, before discussing this issue we need to attend in a little more detail
to the political rationalities and technologies through which neoliberal modes of
biopower, disciplinary power, and governmentality are generated and sustained.
3 Political Rationalities and Technologies under Neoliberal
Governmentality
Foucault highlights the emergence of much more complex networks of specialist
organizations and occupations as a precondition for neoliberal modes of govern-
mentality in a wide array of fields such as medicine, law, science, education and
administration (Clegg 1998). They are both products and carriers of a new ‘political
rationality’ – that is, a loosely integrated set of ideas focused on the creation and
management of ‘obedient and/or regularised subjects/bodies’ within large and di-
verse urban populations who must be governed through the promulgation and
3 Political Rationalities and Technologies under Neoliberal Governmentality
61

internalization of discursive practices conducive to self-correction and control. In
this respect, ‘the discourses of neoliberalism reflected a major shift in how politics
could be understood or contested … neoliberalism shrinks the understanding of
human subjectivity, removing the foundational sphere of rational autonomy’
(Chandler and Reid 2016: 81). Neoliberal subjects cannot be left to their own devi-
ces to develop and grow autonomously into their lives through the acquisition of
better knowledge and understanding. This is because they cannot be relied upon
to adapt to the continually changing demands and pressures presented to them
in their everyday lives within market-dominant economies and societies in
which much of the public support once provided by the state has been hol-
lowed-out and transferred to the private sector. Instead, they must be continually
subject to the ‘preventative management’ which neoliberal governmentality pro-
vides if they are to develop and retain the ‘self-resilient adaptability’ on which in-
dividual survival and advancement depends. In turn, this reduces the neoliberal
subject to a socially isolated ‘rational decision maker’ who is driven by the imper-
ative to maximize on the outcomes of their decisions by subjugating the latter to
the dictates of a market-determined rationality dominated by the pursuit of ration-
al self-interest (Davies 2014, 2018).
As a political rationality, neoliberalism requires a ‘technology’ which trans-
lates its, rather abstract and theoretical, discursive commitments into practical,
on-the-ground changes whereby state power – it’s capacities, responsibilities and
authority – is redefined in ways consistent with the dominance of market forces
and the much more self-resilient subjects they depend upon for their legitimacy
and efficacy (Springer 2016). This is seen to entail a proliferation of non-state agen-
cies which increasingly assume a wide array of functions previously located in cen-
tral state bureaucracies and gradually come to replace the latter as the locus of
political power and decision-making. In this way, by creating an innovative ensem-
ble of rationalities and technologies which displace and replace the sovereign
power of the central state with the disciplinary power and biopower of neoliberal
governmentality, a neoliberal system of rule emerges in which ‘local subjugation’
and ‘strategic knowledge’ are recombined in ways beyond the comprehension,
much less realization, of social democratic state elites.
A plethora of organizational technologies, reinventing and recombining local
control and central domination in novel ways geared to reproducing ‘obedient
and/or regularised subjects/bodies’, have been developed under neoliberal govern-
mentality. Often, these consist of ‘private/public hybrids’ which retain the carapace
of bureaucratic regulation and control but only insofar as it helps, rather than hin-
ders, the enhanced disciplinary power and biopolitics of privatized modes of gov-
ernance unrestrained by extra-market sources of authority and mediation (Davies
2011, 2018; Anderson 2017; Brown 2019). Rather than being imprisoned within a
62
Chapter 3: Demystification

Weberian ‘iron cage’ of bureaucratic rules and conventions, the neoliberal subject
becomes self-enclosed within a ‘panopticon gaze’ of surveillance and control tech-
nologies prioritizing ‘biopolitical life’ as the strategic terrain on which a panoply of
micro-level interventions is required to ensure it either conforms or regularises to
neoliberal governmentality norms. In particular, the combination of disciplinary
power and panopticon control provides this new regime with a matrix of semi-in-
tegrated governance systems and management mechanisms that spatially, tempo-
rally, physically and socio-psychologically contain the ‘neoliberal body/subject’ in
ways consistent with a political rationality legitimated around asocial utility max-
imizing rational actors (Reed 1999).
Private corporate government, and the supporting governance systems and
management mechanisms which make it possible, becomes the institutional and
organizational template for neoliberal governmentality because it protects biopow-
er and disciplinary power from any unwanted external interference making its op-
eration more open to scrutiny and critique. Consequently:
Government is ‘bettered’ by becoming less visible because it manifests itself in forms of au-
thority less detectable than hierarchical forms of government (there is no sovereign entity
that governs, only networks of ‘experts’) and it is more ingrained because it is in place in
the very operational practices of these expert bodies, in the collection of information and
data (statistics). (Sokhi-Bulley 2011: 266)
This power thrives on secrecy, opacity, complexity and confusion because they
cloak it in a veneer of everyday ‘naturalness’ and taken-for-granted ‘common
sense’ that make it very difficult, if not impossible, to challenge. If such challenges
emerge – from the legal system or from civil society organizations and voluntary
movements, for example – then these can be weakened and contained by recourse,
not to the mundane nature of its functioning but, conversely, to its highly rarefied
and esoteric workings only accessible and understandable to those specialists and
experts well-versed in its arcane complexities and mysteries. Thus, much of the
organizational innovation associated with the transition to neoliberal governmen-
tality – ‘network-based governance’, ‘project team working’, ‘hybrid domestic and
office working’, ‘knowledge management’, ‘platform micro-working’ and ‘corporate
social responsibility’ – can be interpreted as masking, or what Burrell (2022) calls
‘camouflaging’, the underlying political reality of privatized disciplinary power
and biopolitics in which resistance, individual or collective, is by no means impos-
sible, but extremely difficult and costly to mobilize (Martí et al. 2017). Once priva-
tized, corporate government is allied with the advanced information and surveil-
lance technologies now routinely available to neoliberal elites in politics, business,
culture and public services, then it becomes doubly difficult to take on the biopow-
er and disciplinary power embedded in neoliberal governmentality regimes due to
3 Political Rationalities and Technologies under Neoliberal Governmentality
63

the considerable risks and costs that it involves for individuals and organizations
alike (Reed 2019).
This also raises the question of what happens to ‘expert authority’ under neo-
liberal governmentality as experts seem to become even more central to the lat-
ter’s operational legitimacy and efficacy but simultaneously more dispensable as
their roles and status are exposed to incessant technological and organizational ra-
tionalization.
4 Expert Authority and Neoliberal Governmentality
Experts should do well under neoliberal governmentality as it is usually seen to
enhance ‘the significance of the “rule of experts” and technocratic knowledge
elites’ (Springer 2016: 25). As Springer goes on to suggest, this can be seen as a
self-reinforcing and reproducing process in which experts come to occupy the
nodal positions within globalized ‘power/knowledge networks’ playing a strategic
role in ensuring that the primary role of the neoliberal state is ‘to unleash market
forces wherever possible, as well as via the locus of state authority and its increas-
ing circumspection of political decision-making’ (Springer 2016: 25). Both discipli-
nary power and biopower embroil experts within their technologies, often provid-
ing the knowledge base from which to discipline or regularise (Ransom 1997). Thus,
neoliberal governmentality ostensibly enhances the power and authority of ex-
perts by placing technocratic knowledge elites at all levels of the governance proc-
ess and ensuring that they design and operate the discursive and material technol-
ogies whereby free market ideology and policy becomes generally accepted as ‘the
only game in town’ (Reed 2019). They also play a strategic role in providing the ex-
pertise and skills whereby the ‘streamlined/strategic state’ can become an organ-
izational reality by promoting policies and programmes, such as market deregula-
tion, service outsourcing, employment flexibility and internal competition, which
shift the burden of scrutiny and accountability away from central government to-
wards organizations and individuals who can no longer rely on the latter as the
primary source of institutionalized trust and order.
Insofar as neoliberal governmentality constitutes an ensemble of political ra-
tionalities and the technologies needed ‘to make them real’ in a constantly moving
and unstable environment in which there is a premium on adaptability and resil-
ience in the face of failure (Mirowski 2013; Peck 2010; Peck and Theodore 2015),
then we would expect it to place the production and dissemination of expert
knowledge at the organizational core of its legitimation and operation. As its de-
pendence on the latter grows, we would also expect the body of experts and ex-
pertise which it draws on for intellectual, technical and political inspiration to be-
64
Chapter 3: Demystification

come more complex, inclusive and heterogeneous encompassing an ever-expand-
ing range of officials, technocrats, advisors and professionals who often offer con-
flicting advice on ‘what is to be done’ or, even more importantly, ‘what is not to be
done’ (Gamble 2009, 2014; Jessop 2010; Loveridge 2013; Reed 2012; Savage and Wil-
liams 2008; Wedel 2011, 2014).
However, this increasingly diverse and influential, if not powerful, configura-
tion of overlapping, contesting and colluding expert circles – increasingly drawn
from the private corporate sector and often at odds with established public service
senior officials and managers – plays a critical role in sustaining neoliberal gov-
ernmentality as a viable mode of governance and management in which ‘the
state’ may become smaller but nonetheless even more ‘strategic’ (Jessop 2008,
2010, 2016; Morgan et al. 2015). In many ways, neoliberal governmentality comes
more closely to resemble Dahl’s (1971: 8) model of ‘polyarchy’ – that is, a political
regime which has been ‘substantially popularized and liberalized, which is highly
inclusive and extensively open to public contestation’ but ruled by competitive elite
minorities who have been forced to allow a widening range of interest groups
‘voice’ as they contend for their electoral support. Experts play an increasingly
strategic role within this neoliberal/polyarchic governmentality regime to the ex-
tent that they provide the specialist knowledge and technologies which frame
and legitimate the ‘offerings’ that ruling minorities make to the electorate in
order to sustain their power in government (Wallace et al. 2023). They blend ideol-
ogy and pragmatism in discourses and technologies which are aimed at retaining
political power and authority within a state apparatus which becomes increasingly
fragmented and fractious but nonetheless sustainable as a mechanism reproduc-
ing elite rule. As a hybrid of oligarchic rule and pluralistic stakeholder participa-
tion, neoliberal governmentality/polyarchy provides neo-liberalization with a via-
ble state form and strategy which can secure its longer-term survival so long as
it retains its inherent flexibility and adaptability.
Experts remain central to retaining this capacity to blend ideology and policy
in ways that enable that ensemble of rationalities and technologies we call ‘neolib-
eral governmentality’ to continue to do its job of reproducing the power relations
and interest coalitions on which it depends for its legitimacy and authority. It has
proved to be highly resilient in its capability to rationalize its mistakes and failures
(Davies 2011) over a period of five decades or more by deftly combining ‘hard’ and
‘soft’ power. This is achieved through the construction and maintenance of an ex-
tensive and complex infrastructure of surveillance and control in parallel with the
promulgation of ‘discursive imaginaries’ promoting the successes and advantages
of the regime and marginalizing any negative views of its performance (Fairclough
2010).
4 Expert Authority and Neoliberal Governmentality
65

This is where experts ‘come into their own’ under neoliberal governmentality
in that they provide the specialist knowledge and skill through which interrelated
systems of surveillance and control can be developed alongside discursive narra-
tives promoting the inevitability and normality of policies and programmes vener-
ating free market ideology and its inherent drive to deregulate, privatize and mar-
ketize (Bowman et al. 2014, 2015; Swarts 2013; Ban 2016). A range of empirical and
investigative studies have demonstrated the crucial role that experts – lawyers,
accountants, public relations and communications consultants, lobbyists, academ-
ics, statisticians, social media specialists, think tank associates and journalists –
play as ‘technocratic fixers’ and ‘political brokers’ mediating between competing
factions within neoliberal elite circles to ensure that neoliberal governmentality
sustains its underlying ideological momentum and political drive in the policy re-
gimes and programmes it legitimates and promotes (Heusinkveld, Gabbionetta,
Werr and Sturdy 2018; Wedel 2011, 2014; Spence, Voulgaris and Maclean 2017;
Burns 2019; Saks 2021). In this regard, finance specialists and economists have
been particularly prominent to the extent they have provided the intellectual, an-
alytical and technical resources whereby neoliberal political elites can justify the
dominance of financial markets, services and products within our political econo-
my no matter how spectacularly they fail and generate economic crises with long-
term consequences for those most exposed to their ravages (Davis 2009; Davies
2014; Lapavitsas 2013; Ho 2009; Morgan et al. 2015; Christophers 2020). Expertise
in financial management, whether for the corporation, household, agency or util-
ity, becomes the sine qua non of survival under neoliberal governmentality in
which market discipline comes to exercise a pervasive rule over all aspects of eco-
nomic, political and social life.
However, these studies also reveal growing inequalities and divisions between
different expert occupational groups and organizations which have proved so cen-
tral to the rise of neoliberal governmentality. They also document the deleterious
impact these factionalizing and fragmenting tendencies have exerted upon the in-
tegrity and credibility of the orthodox model of ‘expert authority’ as the institu-
tional repository of ‘objective knowledge’ and ‘passive trust’.
Evidence of growing inequality and division within those ‘expert cadres’ who
have been so significant in enabling the rise of neoliberal governmentality and
the policy regimes it has initiated and legitimated can be seen across a range of
dimensions. First, there is the geographic dimension as entailed in the growing di-
vide between those experts who function at a global/transnational level and those
who are defined primarily by their local/national location and sphere of influence
(Ban 2016). Second, comes the sectoral dimension as expressed in a clear hierarchy
of functional domains in which finance/economics is the dominant area of exper-
tise to which everything else comes a very ‘poor second’ (Christensen 2017; Davies
66
Chapter 3: Demystification

2017; Brooks 2018). Third, there is the employment reward and security dimension
referring to widening inequalities between a relatively small elite cadre of ‘corpo-
rate professionals’ who enjoy levels of remuneration and protection unheard of by
much larger groupings of middle and lower grade ‘technicians’ designing and run-
ning the information and communication technologies on which the former relies
but rarely acknowledges (Kirkpatrick and Noordegraaf 2015; Sturdy, Wright and
Wylie 2016; Crouch 2016; Sturdy and Mahoney 2018; Johannessen 2019). Finally,
the further away – spatially, organizationally and politically – expert groups are
from the core networks of power and control which emerge within neoliberal gov-
ernmentality, then their capacity to access and influence national-level policy mak-
ing networks is severely diminished to the point where they are downgraded to the
status of ‘roll out drones’ (Wedel 2011, 2014; Peck and Theodore 2015; Ban 2016).
These fissures within the heterogeneous coalitions of expert groups who ‘oil
the wheels’ of neoliberal governmentality through the mediating and brokering
processes which they enable, makes an inherently complex governance system
even more prone to fragment and implode in on itself. Yet, the capacity of the lat-
ter to adapt successfully in the face of these internal challenges should not be un-
derestimated as it continues to sustain the momentum of its political strategy of
‘franchising’ core state functions such as justice, education, welfare and health
(Bowman et al. 2014, 2015), reinforcing the move towards a ‘corporate welfare
state’ (Farnsworth 2014; Wilks 2013) in which vast amounts of public money are
transferred to private corporations, and ‘financializing’ personal and corporate
life by making credit-based expansion the main driver of economic growth so
that financial institutions and organizations come to occupy a dominant position
and role within neoliberal governmentality (Gamble 2009; Willmott 2011; Lapavit-
sas 2013; Davies 2017).
Within each of these key policy areas, elite expert occupations and organiza-
tions, as well as their ‘supporting cast’ of designers and technicians, have deployed
their expertise to construct, operate and normalize a complex intellectual and
technological infrastructure through which dominant political ideologies and dis-
courses can be translated into policy ideas and programmatic initiatives that re-
mains ‘loyal to the neoliberal theoretical core’ (Ban 2016: 19) while facilitating
all sorts of local ‘hybrid trade offs’ better adapted to their key constituencies
and conditions. As Peck and Theodore (2015: 24) suggest, ‘expert and technocratic
networks have been instrumental in the propagation of neoliberal reason, practice
and rule’ because they provide the specialized knowledge, models and techniques
through which governmental policies and programmes such as privatization, mar-
ketization and outsourcing can be mobilized and transferred within and across a
wide range of institutional environments. They design, service and repair the ‘trav-
elling technologies’ of government which neo-liberalization depends upon to ach-
4 Expert Authority and Neoliberal Governmentality
67

ieve sufficient and lasting acceptance and diffusion so that they, eventually, be-
come stabilized as dominant policy paradigms or ‘prisms’ through which elite ‘pol-
icy makers read, interpret, and act on the world’ (Peck and Theodore 2015: 19).
But the question remains as to the longer-term impact of this ‘chameleon-like’
act performed by increasing numbers of, factionalized but well-rewarded, expert
groups and organizations on their established claims to authority and the legitima-
cy it routinely bestows. Significant shifts in the locus, coherence, resilience and sta-
bility of ‘expert authority’ are very likely to occur as experts become increasingly
co-opted and embedded in new configurations of power relations entailing emerg-
ing asymmetries in legitimacy and control. Indeed, the inherent dynamism, mobi-
lity and ‘transformational potential’ of neo-liberalization and neoliberal govern-
mentality destabilizes established expert hierarchies and divisions in all sorts of
ways, making them more exposed and vulnerable to the dislocating impact of
‘technocratic/political modernization’ as it unevenly rationalizes certain expert
groups out of existence and generates opportunities for others to emerge. This
also exacerbates prevailing political tensions and conflicts within expert power
networks as they struggle to prove their worth to neoliberal governmental elites
desperate to demonstrate that the new policy paradigm is working and unforgiv-
ing of any, actual or perceived, failure on the part of ‘their experts’ to deliver the
technologies whereby ‘success’ can be documented and failure eradicated, or at
least obscured and hidden from public view.
In general terms, the rise of biopolitics, disciplinary power, and neoliberal gov-
ernmentality has burnished the ‘technocratic’ credentials of experts but at the ex-
pense of substantially weakening their authority as ‘public servants’ legitimated by
their dedicated commitment to a social democratic state in which the safety and
security of its citizens is the overriding policy imperative. They are increasingly
viewed as a remote and self-serving elite disengaged from the everyday lives
and concerns of ordinary citizens as they struggle to survive under the unrelenting
pressures exerted by market-driven economies and societies in which regulative
constraints have been progressively dismantled and delegitimated. In turn, this
has ideologically and politically exposed expert occupational groups to ‘populist
critique’ – often mounted by elite politicians within ruling neoliberal regimes de-
termined to secure electoral advantage from ‘culture war’ campaigns – which fur-
ther erodes whatever shreds of institutionalized trust and legitimacy they have
managed to retain. Indeed, several researchers (Davies 2018; Bickerton and Accetti
2021; Vormann and Weinman 2021) have identified the emergence of a new polit-
ical rationality or logic in which selected elements of authoritarian populism
and technocratic expertise are fused together in support of political movements
and parties hostile to the restraining influence of liberal democratic values and
norms. However, this emerging populist/technocratic political rationality requires
68
Chapter 3: Demystification

experts to surrender whatever independence and autonomy they may have legit-
imately accrued under the latter in the service of a wider ideological discourse
and political project where they are forced to subordinate their collective interests
to its dictates. Their ‘authority’ as purveyors of specialist knowledge and skills is
now completely subordinated to populist causes and programmes which threaten
to undermine whatever credibility they may have left as independent public serv-
ants supposedly acting on behalf of a liberal democratic state constrained by the
norms and conventions of representative parliamentary government.
Analysed in these terms, expert authority ‘sups with’ neoliberal governmental-
ity and its authoritarian populist inclinations at its peril; although the latter pro-
vides a socio-political context and apparatus in which the technocratic side of
expert authority may flourish, it also poses an existential threat to its viability
and survivability as a credible source of disinterested specialist knowledge vital
to maintaining the safety and security of a democracy’s citizens in the face of
major threats to their health and wellbeing. Experts dealing with neoliberal gov-
ernmentality is rather like children ‘playing with fire’ – it has its attractions
and excitements but at the risk of becoming trapped in the flames of a political
wildfire that will inevitably engulf them and destroy their credibility and viability
as necessary and authoritative sources of knowledge and advice in high stakes,
high risk environments.
5 Structural and Cultural Changes
Unsurprisingly, the structural and cultural changes which the demystification nar-
rative identifies as being generated as a result of the shift to biopolitics, disciplina-
ry power, and neoliberal governmentality are very different from those highlighted
by the de-legitimation narrative. While the latter predicts a system-wide break-
down in the institutionalized trust relations through which expert authority had
been legitimated, the former anticipates a much more complex and contradictory
dynamic in which the ‘technocratic’ components of expert authority are strength-
ened but at the expense of fundamentally weakening any claims it may try to make
concerning its independence, autonomy or objectivity.
To return to Miller and Rose (2008: 24), neoliberal governmentality ‘seeks to
de-governmentalize the state and de-statize practices of government’ by drastically
circumscribing what the state is expected to do and redefining how those remain-
ing core functions are to be performed and organized. At one level, this entails the
state withdrawing from many of the responsibilities and tasks which were previ-
ously taken-for-granted as being within its strategic vision and operational pur-
view, such as ‘full employment’ or ‘universal health and social care’ or ‘poverty re-

duction’ or ‘social mobility’ or ‘industrial planning’ or ‘public health’ or ‘climate
change’. In turn, in line with the growth of rentier capitalism, these policy con-
cerns are incrementally transferred to non-state agencies, particularly private sec-
tor corporations, who now operate as ‘state surrogates’ regulating and managing
areas of social and economic life once regarded as central to the conduct of govern-
ment.
This drastically downgrades, in theory and practice, the power and authority
of ‘the centre’ to engage directly in the micro-management of its citizens daily lives
and to take responsibility for protecting them from the threats and risks they face
from recurring economic, social and environmental crises. Indeed, under neoliber-
al governmentality the onus is very much on ‘individuals’ and ‘families’ becoming
sufficiently robust and resilient to navigate their way through the threats and chal-
lenges which market-driven economies and societies will inevitably throw at them.
It also downgrades the significance and status of experts as ‘public servants’ who
provide vital assistance to the general public, particularly in crisis situations when
their expertise can make the difference between life or death, or at least between
success or failure. At best, they are placed in a secondary or subordinate position
and role to the newly empowered cadre of private sector technocrats, managers
and consultants who take on the unenviable task of providing whatever protection
and support can be mobilized for the general populace by the ‘outsourced state’.
However, the other side of Miller and Rose’s neoliberal governmentality re-
quires experts to take on enhanced responsibilities and powers legitimating the
elevation of ‘market-based principles and techniques of evaluation to the level
of state-endorsed norms’ (Davies 2014: 6). A swathe of institutions, organizations,
groups and practices previously regarded as being outside the discipline of market
logic must now be reconstituted in such a way that they, at the very least ‘resemble
markets, if not entirely conforming to the latter’s theoretical principles and opera-
tional requirements’ (Davies 2014: 38). Thus, the technocrats, managers and consul-
tants newly empowered by neoliberal governmentality and the political rationali-
ties and technologies which it legitimates become the key actors in ensuring the
marketization of all social relations encompassing ‘the whole ensemble of social
institutions, organizations, networks and norms of conduct which regularize eco-
nomic relations’ (Jessop 1994: 30). They are given the task of ensuring that as much
as possible of non-economic life is brought under the domination and control of
market discipline – even if this is a simulacrum of the latter rather than its reality
– so that it conforms to the norms and rules of market competition which are the
only guarantors of efficiency and effectiveness. By designing and operating the
technologies through which non-market relations are transformed into market re-
lations, experts under neoliberal governmentality become the carriers of a politi-
cal rationality which putatively transforms whole ways of existing and living so
70
Chapter 3: Demystification

that they conform to these newly state-endorsed norms of market determined ex-
changes.
But, of course, there are ‘winners’ and ‘losers’ under neoliberal governmental-
ity which exposes its ‘expert carriers’ to criticism from an ever-expanding set of
stakeholders that they can no longer sustain any kind of claim or legitimacy to
be acting on behalf of the ‘general good’ because they are increasingly remote to
and disengaged from ordinary people leading ordinary lives. Once the vested inter-
ests and norms which these ‘neoliberal technocrats’ serve are fully revealed by
the political rationalities and technologies which they impose as they go about
their business of marketizing non-market relations, then any discursive strategy
aimed at defending their role and status as ‘public servants’ is denuded of its le-
gitimacy. This is even more the case when we look at the mediating mechanisms
through which their ‘mission’ under neoliberal governmentality is carried for-
ward.
6 Mediating Mechanisms
Previous discussion suggests that a wide range of expert groups have played a cen-
tral role under neoliberal governmentality in reconstructing and repurposing
‘the state’ in order to ensure that it becomes strategically focussed on transforming
‘society’ in ways which are consistent with the supremacy of ‘market forces’ in all
aspects of its operation and organization. They have become the primary agents,
operating within and across state/non-state boundaries which have become in-
creasingly deregulated and porous, ensuring that market competition and its dis-
ciplinary impact is progressively ‘rolled out’ across all spheres of economic, social
and political life. This is to be realized, however imperfectly and messily in prac-
tice, through a form of ‘statecraft’ directed to the production of ‘neoliberal sub-
jects’ who conform to whatever state-endorsed norms and routines are required
under neoliberal governmentality.
As a result, ‘expert authority’ becomes entangled in extended networks of
material and discursive relations in which the systemic contradictions between
its ‘technocratic’ and ‘public service’ components are exacerbated and more
fully exposed to critique, whether this comes ‘from above’ or ‘from below’ in the
guise of elitist distancing or populist rejection. Experts are now key actors within
these networks because they assemble and operate the political rationalities and
technologies through which the supremacy of ‘the market’ in all aspects of our
lives is to be made possible. They are the major carriers of a political rationality
whereby all social relations are to be subjected to the disciplining power of market
forces and its liberating impact on all aspects of neoliberal subjects’ identities and

lives. Also, they’re expected, by ruling neoliberal elites, to design and run the tech-
nologies through which this transformational project can be enacted in ways that
conceal, or at least obscure, its inevitable negative consequences for those who re-
fuse to accept its domination.
While this enhances the status and influence of experts as ‘technical special-
ists’, it simultaneously weakens whatever remains of their moral authority as ‘pub-
lic service professionals’ dedicated to the protection of the body politic and the so-
cial bonds on which it depends for its legitimacy and stability. On the one hand,
expert groups are charged with being ‘remote’, ‘uncaring’, ‘self-interested’ and ‘du-
plicitous’; on the other, they begin to lose their mystique as ‘guardians of the public
good’ as they are reduced to the status of just another vested interest desperately
trying to bolster their advantages in an increasingly fragmented and ‘dog-eat-dog’
world. They can no longer hide behind a ‘veil of ignorance’ in which their clients
and customers passively trust them to do their best for them and for the rest of
society as their key role in unleashing the forces of ‘creative destruction’ which
neo-liberalization inevitably releases becomes more evident. Neoliberal govern-
mentality and the statecraft on which it relies to ensure its reproduction, exposes
experts to the full blast of public resentment and political criticism because they
are charged with ‘making the system work’ as it inevitably fails to deliver on its
promises. If neoliberal governmentality and the political project it’s meant to
deliver can be seen as ‘consistently failing forward’ because they have ‘always
been about the capture and re-use of the state in the interests of pro-corporate,
free-trading market order’ (Peck 2010: 9) – this inevitably means there are likely
to be many more ‘losers’ than ‘winners’ under its rule. Consequently, experts
are the most obvious and convenient ‘fall guys’ for these deleterious outcomes.
Their authority and status as disinterested public servants dispensing their exper-
tise on behalf of society can no longer be sustained in a world where their culpa-
bility in producing so many of the ills which now confronts its members is so evi-
dent and undefendable.
However, several interrelated mechanisms have emerged under neoliberal
governmentality geared to mediating and moderating these systemic tensions
and their destructive impact on expert authority.
First, a whole panoply of advanced surveillance and control systems have been
developed over time as neoliberal governmentality has learned from its own mis-
takes and striven to at least contain, if not eradicate, escalating structural tensions
and conflicts within and between the expert groups who make its rule possible.
Second, various creative ‘discursive imaginaries’ have been promulgated as a
way of rationalizing mistakes and failures as necessary ‘learning experiments’
which must, however unfortunately, be experienced if the full advantages of
neo-liberalization are to be realized. Third, a seemingly never-ending stream of in-
72
Chapter 3: Demystification

novative organizational forms and practices have been promoted under neoliberal
governmentality as potential ‘shock absorbers’ of the risks, dislocations and polar-
izations which the neoliberal ‘stealth revolution’ (Brown 2019) inevitably produces.
Surveillance and control systems are central to neoliberal governmentality be-
cause they enable governmentality to achieve the simultaneous ‘double movement’
of mobility and co-ordination which would be impossible under traditional state
forms and the highly centralized and formalized administrative systems through
which they rule (Dean 1999; Jessop 2010; Mau 2019). The evolution of digital tech-
nologies and their capability for surveillance capitalism (Zuboff 2019) and the
transformation of social life to big data (Dencik 2020), play a key role here. It al-
lows technocracy to dominate (Sylvia and Andrejevic 2016), but also ensnares ex-
perts into to propagating more innovative modes of governmentality through
more technically advanced, organizationally pervasive, and socially ubiquitous sur-
veillance regimes (Kellogg et al. 2020;Visser et al. 2018) whilst also entrapping them
with those same regimes as well. Therefore, expert authority and status are con-
siderably enhanced through the benefits which these systems deliver – particularly
in crisis situations requiring highly specialized risk management technologies –
and the reality that they would be theoretically unrealizable and practically impos-
sible without the technical expertise which their architects and operators provide.
This serves to moderate the criticism and suspicion which ‘experts’ increasingly
attract, but it also reminds us that much of the trust we place in them is manufac-
tured rather than bestowed and consequently inherently more fragile in the face
of ‘evidence’ which undermines their credibility as indispensable navigators
through ‘troubled times’.
Creative discursive imaginaries (Fairclough 2010: 444) tell us stories about how
obstacles and difficulties may be overcome by representing ‘how things are’ and
‘how they might be’ if we would ‘only do better next time’. Experts shape and
disseminate these narratives in ways that are subject to certain ‘conditions of pos-
sibility’, ‘including what we might call practical adequacy – the world must be such
that the imagined reality is possible, the agents imagined as bringing it into being
have the power to so, and so forth – and conviction – imaginaries and the strat-
egies they are part of have to be convincing for the people who need to be con-
vinced’ (Fairclough 2010: 480 emphasis in original). Neo-liberalization has exhibit-
ed a very high degree of discursive flexibility and creativity, particularly in the face
of spectacular failures to deliver on its promises in economic policy, health and
welfare policy, education policy or international policy. Yet, expert neoliberal
story tellers have, with unnerving consistency, managed to redefine ‘failure’ as re-
quiring more of the same, or indeed stronger, treatment from the neoliberal gov-
ernmentality playbook and this has further cemented their positions within its
power networks. But how much longer this expert capacity to generate strategic
6 Mediating Mechanisms
73

narratives through creative discursive imaginaries which are both practically ad-
equate and convincing to an increasingly disenchanted and sceptical public audi-
ence can be sustained is highly questionable – particularly in the face of multiple
crises which seem to undermine the credibility of the neoliberal project and its
governmentality.
Finally, neoliberal governmentality has supported a rush of experimentation
in new organizational forms and practices which experts have promoted as sus-
taining, or at least reigniting, the transformation of sclerotic bureaucratic dino-
saurs into dynamic entrepreneurial systems (Burrell 2022). Much of this develop-
ment can be traced back to the ‘post-bureaucratic’ literature of the 1990s and the
academic legitimacy it provided for wider organizational changes in western polit-
ical economies which seemed to herald the transition to a more flexible and crea-
tive organizational future in the twenty-first century (Reed 2005). However, as Bur-
rell (2022) documents in some detail, over the last decade or so the burgeoning
literature on organizational experimentation seems to have been driven by the po-
litical drive to camouflage the realities of neo-liberalization in positive, upbeat
‘change narratives’ which elide the damage done by the latter to the socio-political
fabric of the Anglo-American economies in which its remit has run largest. Once
again, experts find themselves caught in the cross hairs of neo-liberalization as
they twist and turn in the face of the opportunities and threats which it presents
to them.
7 Substantive Outcomes
The major substantive outcome which the demystification narrative identifies
is the transition to a neoliberal governmentality in which a ‘strategic/relational
state’ emerges as ‘an ensemble of power centres that offer unequal chances to dif-
ferent forces within and outside the state to act for different purposes … the state
does not exercise power; its powers are activated through the agency of definite
political forces in specific conjunctures’ (Jessop 2008: 37). It very strongly suggests
that the sovereign power of the central state, as envisaged by Hobbes or Weber,
can no longer hold under these conditions because a plurality of power centres
and their supporting political rationalities and technologies have emerged that
eat away at the former’s structural integrity and organizational capacity. This
doesn’t mean to say that under neoliberal governmentality the state disappears
or is so fundamentally weakened that it can no longer play any part in the political
organization and management of socio-economic life. Indeed, in its more stream-
lined and strategically focussed form, the state under neoliberal governmentality
74
Chapter 3: Demystification

becomes redesigned and repurposed in ways which are more consistent with the
project of creating and sustaining ‘market societies’.
Under this reconfigured and refocused neoliberal state, experts come to play a
very different role than that envisaged in the de-legitimation or decomposition
narratives as outlined in chapters two and four of this book. They become the tech-
nocratic cadres who equip the neoliberal state and its governing apparatus with
the political rationalities and technologies it requires to think and act more stra-
tegically, while also providing the discursive imaginaries that are needed when
its policy initiatives and programmes hit cold reality and the inevitable recalibra-
tions and recalculations which this will call for if the neoliberal ‘stealth revolution’
is to survive these encounters in any kind of coherent shape. As such, experts
under neoliberal governmentality are condemned to ‘life on the edge’ of a regime
from which they derive much benefit, but in which they are forced to absorb the
incessant instabilities and uncertainties that this inevitably reproduces.
8 Conclusion
Perhaps rather surprisingly, the demystification narrative proffers a somewhat
more positive and upbeat evaluation of expert authority than that articulated by
the de-legitimation narrative. At the very least, it sees a future for experts in
which their power, status and legitimacy are reframed by the emergence of neo-
liberal governmentality in which they become key actors in the relational net-
works through which this can be enacted and reproduced. It may be their fate
under this regime to have to endure the ineradicable instabilities and uncertain-
ties which this generates and thrives on as it works its way through the institution-
al infrastructure of the social democratic state so pivotal to the legitimation of
expert power for the de-legitimation narrative. But at least they have a future –
indeed a central position and role – within neoliberal governmentality as it be-
comes more prominent across an increasing number of societies and economies.
However, they have been reduced in status to ‘technocratic fixers’ for a neo-liberal
governmentality regime that they simultaneously operate and are subject to – they
are both architects and slaves of the latter insofar as it can’t do without them but
will also dispose of them in the blinking of an eye if this is deemed politically ex-
pedient by the ruling political elite.
In the next chapter we consider the third narrative account of ‘the crisis in
expert authority’ – that is, the decomposition narrative which sees expert author-
ity being broken down into its separate, constituent elements and being reconsti-
tuted in a form that puts it in a better position to cope with and overcome threats
and challenges to its survival.

Chapter 4: Decomposition
1 Introduction
Each of the narratives reviewed in this book accepts that the restructuring of the
expert division of labour which has been occurring in Anglo-American political
economies over more than four decades has substantially changed the nature of
expert work and the way it is organized. However, they differ considerably in
how they gauge the long-term impact of this restructuring and reconfiguring proc-
ess in relation to how expert authority is to be legitimated in the future.
As we have already seen, the de-legitimation narrative proffers the most pes-
simistic reading of these developments to the extent that it insists on seeing the
latter as indicative of an unrepairable erosion of expert authority generated by
a ‘fatal conjunction’ between ever more concentrated economic and political
power and an irreversible fragmenting and factionalizing of expert jurisdictional
work domains. Expert authority is damaged beyond redemption to the extent that
the institutionalized trust relation between experts, publics, and states has been
progressively dismantled by unaccountable concentrations of elite economic and
political power at ‘the centre’ determined to take control of expert work and grow-
ing disenchantment with and distrust of remote and uncaring technocratic experts
within ‘the periphery’ of civil society and local communities.
For the demystification narrative, these developments signal a socio-political
process whereby ‘expert authority’ has been progressively stripped of its cultural
and symbolic secretiveness and remoteness to be revealed for what it really is –
that is, a key component within more complex and labyrinthine-like power net-
works in which ‘experts’ design and operate the surveillance technologies through
which ‘new subjectivities’ are constructed and controlled. Considered in this way,
experts and the work they perform remains of vital importance for the new gov-
ernance regimes emerging in modern states and societies. But their aura of objec-
tive rationality and political disinterestedness has been dissipated by their subor-
dination to a much more rapacious and unforgiving neoliberal governmentality
pervading advanced capitalist societies. Hardt and Negri (2019: 125–138) suggest
this is leading to a crisis of the modern administrative state or ‘Weber in reverse’.
Weber’s dream of ‘a rational, just, and transparent bureaucracy’ run by cadres of
enlightened experts, and Kafka’s nightmare of ‘obscure and alienating forms of
modern bureaucratic power’, are both superseded by ‘digital Taylorism’. Within
the latter, the production of ‘machine subjectivities’ emerges as the dominant po-
litical and administrative imperative where ‘a complex mixture of legal reasoning,
compassion, fear and callousness in play in governmental decisions’ (Hardt and
https://doi.org/10.1515/9783110734911-005

Negri 2019: 130) shapes the organizational context in which expert knowledge is
generated and consumed.
For the decomposition narrative, both the de-legitimation and demystification
narratives overestimate the destructive power and impact of the restructuring and
reconfiguring of expert work which has been dynamically working away since
the 1980s. It offers an alternative mapping and interpretation of these changes
in which the ‘adaptive capacity’ of the system of expert work is emphasized, so
that the emergence of a more contested and complex ecology of expertise is viewed
in a much more positive light because in enables the latter to grow and develop in
ways which meet the new challenges posed by 21st century economic and social
change. Far from witnessing the dismantling of expert authority, we are experienc-
ing its renewal and realignment within an evolving ecology of expertise in which
flexibility of response and connectiveness with wider society are the keys to future
expansion and legitimacy. While the ‘old order’ of elite professionalization, based
on epistemological exclusivity and jurisdictional control, may, no longer, be the
dominant exemplar to follow, new and more innovative forms of expertise are
emerging which redefine the normative frameworks and social forms through
which the latter can be legitimated and stabilized. As the established system of ex-
pert accreditation decomposes, it simultaneously recomposes itself into a more
complex institutional form which self-adjusts and self-corrects in order to absorb
threats to its equilibrium and long-term survival.
Accepting that expert authority, particularly in its more institutionalized and
formalized forms, has been exposed to the fragmenting and fracturing dynamic of
rapid socio-technical innovation and change, supporters of the decomposition nar-
rative reject the innate pessimism and fatalism of the de-legitimation and demys-
tification narratives. They believe in the inherent organizational adaptability and
resilience of the system of expert occupations to absorb threats to its existence and
to retain control over the structural and cultural mechanisms through which it is
reproduced and develops. Kirkpatrick, Aulakh and Muzio (2021: 3–4) express this
underlying confidence in the innate organizational capacity of the system of expert
occupations to absorb and transcend all threats to its existence in the following
terms:
While professionalism has adjusted partly in response to the changing political and ideolog-
ical climate, overall, there has been no wholesale reshaping of the turn-of-the-millennium in-
stitution … to a greater or lesser extent, in developed capitalist economies, professionalism
has been (and arguably remains) the dominant approach to organizing and regulating expert
labour.
Their confident reassertion of the continued dominance of professionalism as the
primary institutional mechanism for regulating expert work and of the ‘minimal
1 Introduction
77

impact of neoliberal ideas inspired policies on professionalism’ (Kirkpatrick, Au-
lakh and Muzio 2021: 13–14), rests on the argument that – particularly in the US
but in other market-based capitalist political economies as well – a sophisticated
‘certification ecosystem’ remains firmly in place to ensure ‘the robustness and em-
bedded nature of professional regulation’. For them, the latter reinforces and re-
produces the institutional architecture through which professionalism, as a formal
mode of occupational regulation, retains its legitimacy and continuity even in the
face of destabilizing structural and cultural changes ostensibly pushing in the di-
rection of de-professionalized modes of organizing and controlling expert work.
Far from witnessing ‘Weber in reverse’ – that is, a long-term decline in profession-
alized modes of expert authorization and regulation based on ‘epistemological ex-
clusion’ and ‘jurisdictional closure’ as outlined in chapter one of this book – we
must recognize the underlying institutional resilience of professionalism in the
face of, supposedly, existential threats to its survival.
Kirkpatrick, Aulakh and Muzio’s (2021) rejection of, what they label, ‘grand
narrative’ theories of professional de-legitimation and demystification, lies at the
more optimistic end of the spectrum of analyses and views reviewed in this chap-
ter. Like other analysts associated with the decomposition narrative, they accept
that the expert division of labour has become more differentiated, fragmented
and contested in recent decades under the combined pressures exerted by politi-
cal, economic, technological and cultural change. But they remain confident that
‘professionalism’, even in something like its Weberian/ideal-typical form, has the
required innate institutional resilience and organizational flexibility to withstand
any threats to its continuance because it provides the most reliable and robust sys-
tems for licensing and accrediting ‘expert labour’. We will return to their analysis
and the conclusions they draw from it later in this chapter as we review and assess
the full range of arguments and evidence advanced in support of the decomposi-
tion narrative. Suffice to say at this point that they put a great deal of emphasis on
‘occupational licensing’ and analytically equate it with ‘professional accreditation’.
This conceptual elision between a relatively low-level, routine exercise in bureau-
cratic or ‘paper checking’ processing and a high-level, extended process of selective
admittance and socialization into an esoteric and exclusive expert occupational as-
sociation may be particularly relevant if increasing reliance on the former is seen
as a key indicator of waning authority and diluted status rather than its obverse.
Kirkpatrick, Aulakh and Muzio (2021) also rely heavily, as do many contribu-
tors to the decomposition narrative discussed in this chapter, on a ‘neo-evolution-
ary institutionalism’ as their major explanatory theory of how a more complex ex-
pert ecosystem self-adjusts and self-corrects to a more threatening institutional
environment in order to generate hybridized systems of expert working.
78
Chapter 4: Decomposition

In resorting to a complexity-theory based conception of self-correcting and sta-
bilizing expert ecosystems possessing the innate capacity to re-establish equilibri-
um even in the face of extreme environmental turbulence and dislocation, expo-
nents of the decomposition narrative risk marginalizing, if not excluding, the
pivotal role of power relations and processes in shaping the legitimacy struggles
through which expert authority is won and lost. By treating the latter as the official
organizational outcome of regulatory mechanisms and ‘certification ecosystems’
that continue to function according to their own institutional logic irrespective
of escalating threats to their cultural meaning and political relevance, some de-
composition analysts may be again guilty of perpetrating a recurring confusion be-
tween ‘formal’ and ‘substantive’ rationality. Just because the incidence of occupa-
tional licensing or any other form of work-related certification is empirically
increasing doesn’t entail that it can be ‘read off ’ as a prime substantive indicator
of the continuing, or indeed increasing, power, authority and status of those occu-
pations to which it relates. Indeed, the proliferation of those occupational groups
claiming, ‘expert status and identity’, through whatever licensing, accrediting and
regulating mechanisms they chose to utilize, is to be expected as one of the defin-
ing features of ‘reflexive modernization’ as discussed in previous chapters of this
book. But this differentiation dynamic is likely to generate increasing segmenta-
tion, fragmentation and factionalism as more occupational groups struggle to occu-
py and police jurisdictional work domains as they become more open to conflicting
claims of authority-granting competence and control. In this respect, expert au-
thority becomes even more contested, diluted and unstable the more it comes to
rely on strategies of exclusion and closure dependent on formalized licensing
and accreditation. Documentation containing formalized and standardized licens-
ing agreements, even if backed by national occupational associations or local gov-
ernment agencies, will be less effective during intensifying jurisdictional conflicts
in which securing wider public legitimacy and support, often mediated through na-
tional media and state organizations, remains the key to securing and retaining
expert authority at a societal level. Indeed, an increasing emphasis on occupation-
al licensing, rather than pursuing an expansive strategy focused on securing and
retaining wider social and political legitimation through ‘epistemological exclu-
sion’, can be interpreted as a key indicator of a partial de-coupling of the twin-
track approach (epistemological exclusion and jurisdictional closure) to institu-
tionalizing expert authority as outlined in chapter one of this book. This is a
theme we will return to later in this chapter.
Occupational licensing may be part of the story but it retains a minor role in
the continuing struggle to legitimate expertise within a 21st century socio-historical
context which has moved on somewhat from the mid/late nineteenth/early twen-
tieth century timelines in which ‘professionalizing projects’ really began to attract
1 Introduction
79

political momentum and support from central government elites on which profes-
sional associations were so dependent for their power and authority (Larson 2013;
Burns 2019; Sacks 2021).
Our exposition and evaluation of the decomposition narrative will follow the
pattern established in previous chapters. First, we will discuss the key ‘structural
and cultural changes’ which exponents of this approach have identified as im-
pacting on the nature, organization and control of expert labour since the late
1970/early 1980s, primarily but not exclusively in Anglo-American political econo-
mies. Second, we will look at the ‘mediating mechanisms’ through which these
impacts have been filtered and interpreted to generate the potential for conse-
quential transformations in the ways expert work is authorized and legitimated.
Third, we examine the ‘substantive outcomes’ that have occurred in order to as-
sess how and why this potential has either been realized or nullified within com-
plex socio-historical contexts in which ‘patterns’ are always difficult to discern and
to explain amongst a wide range of contrasting and competing developments.
2 Structural and Cultural Changes
Drawing on classic studies of inter-occupational and intra-organizational jurisdic-
tional conflicts between expert groups and the exclusion/closure strategies they
engage in to establish and control jurisdictional domains within the expert division
of labour (Freidson 1994, 2001; Abbott 1988, 2005; Larson 1977/2013, 1990), exponents
of the decomposition narrative have highlighted four interrelated structural
changes which have exerted a major impact on how these conflicts are conducted
and shape emerging patterns of expert work.
First, series of complex institutional and technical changes entailed in
the rise of neoliberal/platform capitalism and new public management which, sep-
arately and cumulatively, have transformed the structural context in which a wide
range of occupational groups vie for recognition and status as ‘experts’ and the
material/symbolic rewards that it bestows on them.
Second, the proliferation of new managerial, technical and scientific occu-
pations contesting and challenging the successful legitimation and closure strat-
egies through which the established professions have established themselves in
the top echelons of the hierarchy of expert work roles and relations.
Third, the increasingly fragmented and fractured expert division of la-
bour which this proliferation and intensification of expert jurisdictional compet-
itions and conflicts has generated and reproduced.
Fourth, intensified ‘ontological insecurity’ on the part of those performing
expert work as they find themselves operating in working environments character-
80
Chapter 4: Decomposition

ized by increasing levels of precarity, instability and uncertainty concerning their
roles and status as specialists who can deal effectively with highly complex or
‘wicked’ problems and the unpredictable risks they present.
2.1 Institutional and Technical Changes
A complex combination of institutional, organizational and technological changes
structurally embedded in the transition to neoliberal/platform capitalism and new
public management are taken as the starting point for the decomposition narra-
tive.
At the global level, these changes embody ‘the collapse of the Bretton Woods
system paving the way for a new international financial and economic order
built on strong ideological faith in in the inherent efficiency and stability of
markets, which opened-up new profit-making opportunities for an increasingly
unregulated financial sector and highly concentrated forms of footloose capital’
(Gallagher and Kozul-Wright 2021: 42). This wider international economic transfor-
mation generates a series of interrelated institutional changes at the national level
further destabilizing the environmental fields and organizational settings in which
expert occupational groups operate. It entails a twin-track evolutionary dynamic in
which nation states and their governments find themselves in a much weaker po-
sition to regulate and control the legal and administrative context in which expert
occupations are accredited and monitored as a result of the transference of these
functions to international bodies and agencies which play an increasingly promi-
nent role in governing them. As Boussebaa and Morgan (2017: 77, emphasis in orig-
inal) argue, in the context of the internationalization of professional service firms
(PSF) and the international legal/administrative architecture through which they
are regulated and governed, ‘professional service firms have to balance efforts
to achieve global integration against the necessity to maintain not only local re-
sponsiveness but also professional autonomy’. They go on to suggest that this del-
icate balancing act between legitimation strategies focused on global regulation
and jurisdictional strategies geared to protecting local professional autonomy is
fundamentally about changing power relations and the much more unstable, shift-
ing and uncertain institutional environments in which professional service firms
operate. If this is the case for knowledge-based and highly specialized expert occu-
pations and organizations such as PSFs, located at the summit of the ‘expert hier-
archy’, then the increasing complexity and escalating risks for others – even if they
face relatively less immediate pressure from international bodies and agencies
than PSFs – are likely to be considerable in their scale and intensity.
2 Structural and Cultural Changes
81

In its emphasis on the institutional destabilization and dislocation generated
by the globalization of different forms of neoliberal capitalism (Swarts 2013; Cahill
2014; Ban 2016; Cahill and Konings 2017), the decomposition narrative is drawing
attention to the destructive dynamic which the latter has released and its impact
on the organization and governance of expert work. Although there has been con-
siderable national and sectoral variation in the extent to which neo-liberalization
has promoted a dismantling of the formal legal, administrative and political infra-
structure through which a wide range of expert occupations and organizations
have been regulated (Suddaby and Muzio 2015; Davis and Williams 2017; Spence,
Voulgaris and Maclean 2017; Adams 2017; Boussard 2018; Davis 2018; Saks and
Brock 2018), there has been an underlying movement towards market-based,
self-regulation and control in which external checks and balances are minimized
in the name of ‘liberalization’ and ‘competition’. This is consistent with the ways in
which neo-liberalization has reconfigured the administrative and governance ap-
paratus through which modern capitalist states govern by ‘creating new forms
of regulation with new market-oriented rules and policies to facilitate the develop-
ment of the “new” capitalism. Society is transformed in the image of the market
and the state is now itself “marketized” [in the form of ] “the competition state”’
(Munck 2005: 63).
Expert occupations and organizations now find themselves in a situation
where ‘the neoliberal project primarily reregulates and institutes an alternative
set of infrastructural arrangements: it never wipes the slate clean so that it gets
closer to the tabula rasa of laissez faire’ (Mirowski 2013: 16, emphasis in original).
This infrastructure of ‘reregulation’ is presented, by apologists for neo-liberaliza-
tion’, as a ‘spontaneous order’ that evolves according to the logic of market compe-
tition and the self-discipline it imposes on all actors irrespective of their choices
and tactics when engaged in market behaviour. However, behind this ideological
and discursive façade lies a brutal social reality in which privatized and marke-
tized reregulation, dominated by the financial and economic interests of powerful
private corporations, determines the conventions, norms, and rules through which
everyday organizational life is ordered and sustained. Thus, Cahill and Konings
(2017: 135–137) analyse reregulation as a long-term strategy of ‘regulatory capture
in reverse’ whereby control over state-driven public policy and the regulative pro-
grammes and regimes it produces are handed back to private corporate interests
under the guise of a deregulatory rhetoric extolling untrammelled ‘market ration-
ality’ as its motivating ethic.
For expert occupations and organizations, this neoliberal-driven strategy of re-
regulation is most clearly seen in the ways it putatively empowers individual con-
sumers and clients to a level at which ‘user sovereignty’ and ‘client capture’ come
to threaten their independence and autonomy (Saks 2021: 87–94). Expert knowl-
82

edge and skill are commodified in ways that equate them with any other commod-
ity subject to market competition and exchange and their overriding need to be
responsive to changing consumer wants and demands. A new bureaucratic surveil-
lance and control technology emerges under neoliberal reregulation geared to
managers ensuring that experts meet the consumer driven performance targets
and metrics which now become the quantitative proxy for market competition
and quality standards (Hibou 2016; Eyal 2019; Mau 2019). The latter find themselves
set-free by market liberalization and regulatory dismantling but only to be recap-
tured, or at least recolonized, by a neoliberal bureaucracy. The latter is dedicated
to a hybrid form of administrative rule which creates new tensions, splits and di-
visions between occupational groups who must be forcibly socialized into a man-
agerial culture and system in which ‘market indifference’ blurs the boundaries be-
tween ‘public’ and ‘private’ to a degree where they become almost meaningless
(Hibou 2016). Whether it be in the field of internationalizing the International Or-
ganization for Standardization (ISO) standards with the intensification of World
Trade Organization (WTO) negotiations or devolving the ‘responsibilization and
personalization’ of healthcare pathways to individual clients, neoliberal bureauc-
racy constructs and legitimates a reregulation regime in which experts are subject-
ed to more intrusive and detailed managerial surveillance and control.
Neoliberal reregulation in the private sector has been mirrored by in the pub-
lic sector where new variants of New Public Management (NPM) have come to play
an increasingly important role in shaping the performance and organization of ex-
pert work. We have already discussed the rise of a distinctive neoliberal form of
NPM in chapter two but in the context of a long-term decline in the public sec-
tor/service as embodying an institutional logic and organizational practice based
on collective values and social equity rather than private interests and market ra-
tionality. This weakening of the public service ethic and the professionally led
modes of service delivery which it legitimated was seen to be reinforced by the
increasing power and authority of ‘calculative experts’ or ‘corporate professionals’
who were progressively taking over the jurisdictional domains previously control-
led, if not dominated, by established public service professionals (Raco 2013; Stur-
dy, Wright and Wylie 2016; Eyal 2019; Reed 2019; Malin 2021).
Thus, the increasing impact of a neoliberal variant of NPM over the last decade
or so has been expressed through the implementation of governance regimes and
organizational technologies geared to subjugating public provision to the scrutiny
of markets as demanded by neoliberal economic and political theory (Peck 2010;
Peck and Theodore 2015; Dardot and Laval 2013; Davies 2014). A rolling programme
of policies and initiatives have been implemented over the last decade or so aimed
at completing the neoliberal (Thatcherite/Reaganite) ‘stealth revolution’ begun in
the 1980s (Blyth 2013; Brown 2015; Bowman et al. 2014; Bowman et al. 2015; Styhre
2 Structural and Cultural Changes
83

2014). The strategic role of the former is aimed at ensuring that market rationality
permeates all areas of public and social life through the imposition of privatization
and marketization technologies such as the private finance initiative and its suc-
cessors (Pollock 2004; Gamble 2014) competitive tendering, outsourcing, franchis-
ing and benchmarking, all legitimated through the mantra of ‘value for money’
and ‘consumer choice’. Across swathes of government activity encompassing hous-
ing and construction, justice, health and social care, education, security and de-
fence, combinations of austerity-driven funding cuts, outsourcing to private sector
corporations, such as Serco and Carillion, whose multinational expansion and
power has been almost entirely dependent on this ‘hollowing out’ of the public sec-
tor (Wilks 2013; Crouch 2016), and the increasing political influence of finance cap-
ital over public policy formulation and implementation (Crouch 2017; White 2016;
Morgan et al. 2015; Vogl 2017) have transformed the institutional landscape in
which expert groups and organizations operate.
From the perspective of the decomposition narrative, this incremental coloni-
zation of public sector institutional positions and organizational jurisdictions by
calculative experts/corporate professionals – facilitated and legitimated by the
rise of a much more ideologically aggressive and politically motivated neoliberal
form of NPM – has been reinforced by various technological and cultural changes
entailing the diffusion of digitally-based surveillance and performance technolo-
gies and the shift towards an ‘entrepreneurial’ managerial culture.
Mau (2019: 111–129) argues that this involves a ‘double movement’ whereby cal-
culative experts, such as business and management consultants, accountancy and
finance specialists, information management technologists, and communications/
public relations professionals, are brought into the public sector to design and im-
plement the new organizational technologies and performance systems whereby
the latter can be remade as a simulacrum of private sector business. These technol-
ogies and systems have the ‘nominative power’ – that is, the capacity to name,
quantify and objectify inherently complex and multi-faceted social phenomena –
required by neoliberal NPM to represent the market-driven reregulation which
they entail as neutral, disinterested, and objective outcomes of an impersonal, de-
terministic process akin to the ways in which selection mechanisms operate under
the laws of spontaneous natural evolution. But they also, simultaneously, have ‘dis-
placement’, as well as ‘nominative’, power in that they break-up established public
sector occupational hierarchies and the knowledge systems which they privilege
by undermining the concentrations of epistemological authority and jurisdictional
closure on which the latter are based. They do this, Mau contends, by challenging
the centralized nominative powers traditionally exercised by established public
sector professionals such as civil servants, medical and scientific specialists, and
other senior public officials. These expert groups are increasingly pushed on to
84
Chapter 4: Decomposition

the margins of strategic decision making as the power vacuums opened-up by the
fragmenting dynamic generated by ‘reregulation displacement’ are filled by net-
works of calculative experts/corporate professionals who are now free to roam
across a wide range of jurisdictional domains unencumbered by ‘bureau-professio-
nal hierarchies.’ It is they who are now the carriers of an innovative and entrepre-
neurial management culture transforming the public sector from a bureaucratical-
ly moribund and professionally stultified institution devouring taxpayers’ money
with little or no regard as to its deleterious impact on public expenditure into
an accessible and open marketplace for the services which it, or more likely its pri-
vate sector corporate surrogates, must provide within a reinvigorated competitive
environment.
2.2 Proliferation of New Managerial, Technical and Scientific Occupations
As Crouch (2016: 69) notes, the rise of neoliberal NPM is not only associated with
the transference of managerial authority and organizational control from estab-
lished public service professionals to private sector technocrats, but also ‘stripping
away ethical inhibitions in the cause of increased profitability.’ Of course, he
recognizes that this process of authority transference and ethical simplification
will be contested in various ways, both by established public service professionals
and by other occupational groups and their representative organizations. He also
sees that the organizational technologies, such as target-based performance indica-
tor regimes, through which market discipline is imposed on public services and the
professionals who they employ will only, at best, partially succeed in their mission
to subjugate public services to market scrutiny.
This continuing push-back and resistance against the surveillance and perfor-
mance technologies to which public service professionals and other public sector
workers are now routinely subjected has been highlighted by several research
studies into public sector workplace behaviour in recent years (Currie et al.
2010; Currie and White 2012; Newman 2013; Reed and Wallace 2015; Gorman and
Vallas 2020). Nevertheless, these studies also support Crouch’s wider argument
that the increasing fragmentation of the expert occupational division of labour
across the public sector has generated an intensification of inter-occupational con-
flict and organizational gameplaying indicative of the long-term movement to-
wards a ‘low trust/high control’ working environment. As the power, if not the au-
thority, of calculative experts/corporate professionals has grown, partly as a result
of their increasing numbers but more crucially as they have breached the bounda-
ries of jurisdictional domains once dominated by established public service profes-
sionals and begun to threaten their control – by enhancing the latter’s dependence
2 Structural and Cultural Changes
85

on the technologies which they design and operate – then, corporate and work-
place power struggles tend to get nastier and more brutish.
It might be argued that the proliferation of expert positions and roles is an out-
come of external structural changes which are unrelated to any wider ideological,
political and ethical struggles because they simply reflect the movement towards
higher levels of environmental complexity and uncertainty demanding a transition
towards more highly differentiated organizational designs and structures. Indeed,
this core argument about the deterministic, causal relationship between ‘environ-
ment and organization’ has been pursued by generations of contingency theorists
(Lawrence and Lorsch 1967) and more recently by those who draw on complexity
theory as offering a more conceptually sophisticated analysis of the ecological de-
terminants of the emergence of organizations and markets (Padgett and Powell
2012). As we have already seen, there are very strong intellectual echoes of this eco-
logical determinism in the analysis of professional licensing and accreditation ad-
vanced by Kirkpatrick et al. (2021).
However, over four decades ago, organization theorists such as Child (1973,
2019), Perrow (1986, 2008) and Silverman (1970) effectively demolished the intellec-
tual foundations of this approach because of its abject failure to incorporate the
power of agency, particularly collective or corporate agency, to shape the structural
conditions and strategic context under and in which occupational and organiza-
tional change must be understood and explained.
This is as true today as it was over forty years ago. Increasing complexity in
the expert divisions of labour in Anglo-American political economies and welfare
systems over this time has been driven by the material concerns and ideological
beliefs of elite groups – who are also embedded in more complex power networks
within government and economy (Reed 2018) – striving to reshape both the public
and private sectors in the light of those interests and values. Expert groups, occu-
pations and organizations in both the public and private sectors are struggling to
protect and enhance their authority and the material/symbolic rewards that it de-
livers within institutional environments and organizational settings which make it
increasingly difficult for them to assume any degree of stability and predictability
in the conditions under which they operate and the challenges which they will face
now and in the future.
Illustrations of this heightened awareness of chronic insecurity amongst ex-
pert groups can be seen in research on the intensified workplace power struggles
occurring between them as the pressures to do whatever needs to be done – irre-
spective of its morality or ethical implications – to hit performance targets, in-
crease turnover and profits, downsize or ‘right size’ employment levels, and to pla-
cate often disgruntled and vociferous customers/clients reaches new levels. While
these pressures often lead to a proliferation of expert roles and an expansion of
86
Chapter 4: Decomposition

their scope and improvement in status, it can also generate a blurring, if not col-
lapsing, of pre-existing jurisdictional boundaries and intensified conflicts around
who has the right or authority to determine where they begin and end or what
the ‘content’ of the work contained within them should (ought to?) be. This ‘desta-
bilization of expert knowledge [work] from within’ (Gorman and Vallas 2020: 3) –
through the fracturing and fragmenting of expert, epistemic and work, commun-
ities generated by new informational, spatial and organizational technologies
and the neoliberal political ideologies driving them – has weakened the authorita-
tiveness of expert knowledge, particularly for established professional groups who
now find themselves forced to compete for control over jurisdictional domains
which have become more crowded, heterogeneous and disrupted.
Recent research and investigative studies on intensifying jurisdictional strug-
gles between expert groups generated by the continuous, if at times staccato,
movement to dominant modes of market-based reregulation disrupting institution-
alized forms of expert authority can be grouped in to three categories: first, ethno-
graphic studies of the everyday organizational processes through which these
conflicts are conducted (Ho 2009; Courpasson, Younes and Reed 2021; Gendrot
2021); second, historical and comparative research focused on inter-occupational
power struggles between corporate and liberal professions (Sturdy, Wright and
Wylie 2015; Sturdy and O’Mahoney 2018); thirdly, sector specific studies focussed
on ‘professional service firms’ and their increasing transnational significance as
the dominant organizational form through which professional services are coordi-
nated and controlled (Empson et al. 2015).
Ho’s (2009) ethnographic study of the ‘white collar sweat shop’ in which elite
Wall Street bankers face the everyday organizational realities of ‘free market cap-
italism in action’ intricately documents the highly contested and fragmented occu-
pational arenas in which they are embedded. Her uncovering of the ‘organization-
al politics of hard work’ in which these elite occupations are routinely engaged
demonstrates that ‘the pinnacle of meritocracy is necessarily precarious: it is
shot through with class, race, and gender hierarchies; with the conscious and anx-
ious performance of smartness; and with a prestigious branding so dependent on
the singularity of the apex that it cannot help but degrade’ (Ho 2009: 58). Thus, in-
vestment analysts, associates, and client managers vie with each other to legiti-
mate their organizational existence as being vital to placating the gods of market
position, profit-making and shareholder values. In so doing, they reproduce the
material conditions and social relations under and through which an aggressive
free-market capitalism which ‘takes no prisoners’ and is as unforgiving of its prog-
eny as it is of its subjects.
Gendrot’s (2021) investigative journalist study, involving an ‘undercover jour-
ney’ in a Parisian police station, reveals the organizational lives of police person-

nel in the French capital as they precariously navigate between the institutional-
ized power of the state and ‘on the ground realities’ they routinely encounter as
they struggle to maintain everyday public order in a class divided and racially
segregated urban community and society. As in the case of Ho’s (2009) study, he
dramatically illuminates the wider tensions and conflicts between different ad-
ministrative/legal sections and intra-occupational groups within the Parisian gen-
darmerie as they attempt to impose some sort of control within an inherently cha-
otic and unmanageable situation in which ‘police professionalism’ is rent with the
very same racial, ethnic, economic, and gendered conflicts its’ meant to contain.
Courpasson, Reed and Younes’s (2021) ethnographically based study of middle
management and professional resistance to neoliberal corporate power and con-
trol highlights the complex social processes entailed in building and sustaining
the communities and solidarities which can become a vital source of opposition
to the policies and programmes corporate elites impose. Thus, it highlights how
work-related and friendship-related community building, within and without the
neoliberal workplace, can generate locations and spaces in which an alternative
moral order to that imposed by the latter can flourish. But it also suggests that
this managerial/professional resistance to neo-liberalization can have contradicto-
ry effects in generating belief systems simultaneously opposing and reflecting the
core assumptions about human agency on which the latter depends. By facilitating
the construction and legitimation of occupational and organizational ‘enclaves of
resistance’, professionals and managers embedded in neoliberal corporate hierar-
chies unavoidably reflect and reproduce the segmented and divided loyalties on
which the latter depends for its continued existence.
Historical and comparative research focused on inter-occupational and intra-
organizational power struggles between calculative/corporate professionals and
liberal/independent professionals (Sturdy,Wright and Wylie 2015; Sturdy and O’Ma-
honey 2018) shows how the transition to market dominated modes of reregulation
and increasing dependence on digital control technologies has transformed the in-
stitutional landscape in which expert occupational groups now operate. They trace
the rise of the neo-bureaucratic organizational form generated by the changing
modes of regulation occurring under neoliberal/investor capitalism as a new site
‘within which new discourses around leadership, networks, new public manage-
ment, knowledge work and enterprise reside’ (Sturdy, Wright and Wylie 2015: 3).
As a structural hybrid recombining selected elements of ‘bureaucratic’ and ‘post
bureaucratic’ organizing logics, the neo-bureaucratic form creates a context in
which occupational restructuring, blurring and redrawing the boundaries between
an expanding array of expert jurisdictional domains and the groups contending to
occupy and control them, becomes commonplace. In particular, the divisions and
distinctions between ‘managerial’ roles as opposed to ‘consultancy’ roles and the
88
Chapter 4: Decomposition

working practices which they separately embody become increasingly difficult to
identify as ‘management consultancy’ comes to dominate an ever-expanding spec-
trum of co-ordinating and controlling tasks within the neo-bureaucratic hybrid or-
ganization. This, highly contested and impactful, simultaneous deconstruction and
reconstruction of corporate managerial and professional consultancy roles, entail-
ing the separation and reintegration of ‘internal’ and ‘external’ jurisdictional do-
mains, results in a reframing of the wider institutional context within which ‘spe-
cialist knowledge and expertise’ are identified and legitimated. Overall, the latter
becomes defined by much higher levels of personal and emotional insecurity
where job tenure, career prospects and development opportunities are increasing-
ly dependent on organizational power politics and the constantly shifting relations
and precarious positionings which they entail.
Putting this study of inter-occupational and intra-organizational expert work
fragmentation into a wider historical and comparative context, (Sturdy and O’Ma-
honey 2018) suggest that national variations in the take-up of management consult-
ing, as constituting a distinctive body of externally sourced ideas, innovations and
practices geared to enhancing the performance of both private and public sector
corporations, can be accounted for primarily in relation to different forms of po-
litical economy. Thus, in Anglo-Saxon political economies much more extensive use
of external management consultancy has been ‘naturalized’ as a universally prefer-
red source of legitimate management knowledge and expertise because of the for-
mers’ historical, cultural, and political adherence to neoliberal market rationality
and the relatively weak legal and administrative regulative regimes to which they
have been subjected.
Finally, the burgeoning literature on professional service firms (PSFs) (Empson
et al. 2015) also illustrates the wider ramifications of an increasingly crowded and
competitive marketplace for expert knowledge and skills and its long-term impact
on an expert division of labour in which a fragmenting and fracturing change dy-
namic has been working away over the last three decades or more. Insofar as they
have become organizational vehicles for the generation and diffusion of innovative
managerial practices across the economic, political, and cultural spheres of con-
temporary societies, so PSFs can be seen to generate new configurations of expert
services and roles characterized by occupational heterogeneity and the more com-
plex regulatory forms which they require once power and control begin to move
from a national to international level. As Quack and Schüßler (2015: 62) contend,
the regulation of PSFs and the expert groups employed by them become a much
more complex affair in which states, firms, agencies, and international organiza-
tions negotiate and bargain to frame the organizational settings in which expert
occupations operate. The relatively cosy and paternalistic regulatory modes char-
acteristic of the 1970s and 1980s in which professionals and states, mediated by es-
2 Structural and Cultural Changes
89

tablished national professional associations, bargained over the rules which would
govern them is gone in a world where the proliferation of internationalized PSFs
necessarily means cross border regulative regimes. While country specific occupa-
tional licensing may continue to happen, its significance is much diminished in a
world where expert work and the ways in which it is organized and regulated are
now embedded within national and transnational contexts in which the power dy-
namics of governance and management are no longer containable in national bu-
reaucratic systems.
2.3 Increasingly Fragmented and Fractured Expert Division of Labour
Heusinkveld et al. (2018) argue that emerging patterns of workplace contestation
between different expert occupational groups over jurisdictional control are
structured around various temporal, spatial and organizational ‘settlements’ re-
flecting the recent expansion of management and related ‘knowledge-based’ occu-
pations into what were previously ‘professionalized task domains.’ Consequently,
they see new domains of ‘competition’, ‘colonization’ and ‘control’ opening-up in
which there is a broadening and blending of inter-occupational jurisdictional do-
mains characterized by increased fluidity, porosity and informality of weakly regu-
lated national and transnational spaces. This constant ‘striving for expert-based au-
thority and jurisdictional control over organizational and field levels’ (Heusinkveld
at al. 2018: 250) revolves around control struggles over knowledge domains and the
strength and durability of their linkages with workplace domains. Thus, the collec-
tive capacity of any expert occupational group to forge strong and enduring rela-
tions between the ‘knowledge’ and ‘work’ domains which they occupy will critical-
ly determine their legitimacy within the wider institutional fields in which they
operate and the socio-economic orders in which the latter are embedded.
They also conclude with the key point that this ongoing and intensifying strug-
gle to secure exclusive access and control over specialized expert knowledge and to
translate this into indeterminate and autonomous work domains subject to mini-
mal interference from either ‘organization-level’ competitors or ‘institutional/soci-
etal-level’ regulators inevitably generate a much more fragmented and factional-
ized expert division of labour. The latter becomes characterized by much higher
levels of complexity, instability and hybridity when compared to a more stable
situation in which a once dominant mode of professionalism comes to terms
with a social democratic state and its governing elites through forms of bureaucrat-
ic credentialism and regulation which recognize the political trade-offs that must
be made in order to meet the legitimate demands of both. As a result of this frag-
menting and factionalizing dynamic, enhanced inter-occupational boundary con-
90
Chapter 4: Decomposition

testation, weaker governance structures and management practices, as well as the
increasing importance of transnational spaces and international governance all
become key structural features of an expert division of labour in which the insti-
tutionalization of new expert occupational groups is inherently unstable and un-
certain.
Once you factor in the increasing power of the consumer of expert services
to shape how the latter are delivered, organized and regulated, as well as the ‘dig-
ital empowerment’ of the consumer/client highlighted in previous sections of this
book, you begin to see an emerging expert division of labour that has moved way
beyond the confines of a ‘bureau-professionalized’ system in which a social demo-
cratic state and its governing elites take collective responsibility for ensuring stable
order through formalized regulation and managed consensus. The technocratic
dream (or Weberian/Kafkaesque nightmare, depending on your point of view) of
elite human and machine-based expertise replacing inherently ‘messy’ and ‘waste-
ful’ democratic processes – that is, some political hybrid of technocracy and autoc-
racy or what Runciman (2019: 180 –191) labels ‘epistocracy’ or ‘rule by the people
who know best’ – seems likely to remain just a dream if those groups supposed to
realise it remain so divided and segmented. Other scenarios involving the selective
recombination of ideological, political and organizational elements of populism,
authoritarianism, neoliberalism and technocracy (Bickerton and Accetti 2021)
seem much more realistic options in a socio-historical context in which legitimacy
struggles around claims to ‘expert authority’ have become more intensely contest-
ed.
Also, as we shall see in chapters six and seven of this book, alternative ‘expert
futures’ are possible in which the legitimacy of expert authority emerges from
much more reflexive, participative and inclusive forms of societal and organiza-
tional politics which reject the anti-democratic sensibilities that seem to be dom-
inant now.
2.4 Intensified Ontological Insecurity
Giddens (1984, 1987, 2000) argues that ‘ontological insecurity’ has become endemic
within modern societies and corporations to the extent that the latter are routine-
ly failing to provide the everyday social relations and organizational routines
through which relatively stable and resilient self-identities can be constructed
and sustained. Indeed, ‘reflexive modernization’ has undermined the processes
and relations through which individual and collective security were established
by subjecting them to the ruthless imposition of disruptive expert systems and
organizational technologies radically destabilizing the negotiated settlements on
2 Structural and Cultural Changes
91

which bureaucratically managed order and control depended. While ‘ontological
insecurity’ can be seen in its most ‘extreme’ form in ‘total institutions’ (Goffman
1961; Pick 2022), such as concentration camps, prisons and asylums which system-
atically ‘strip’ individuals of their pre-existing identities and subject them to per-
vasive surveillance regimes, contemporary corporate organizations mimic these
totalizing organizational practices and relations by selectively reimposing them
through widespread employment precarity, performance regimes and managerial
cultures in which ‘organized irresponsibility’ are the dominant realities (Jackall
1998/2010; Vaughan 1996; Styhre 2014).
So, while some level of ontological insecurity has characterised the working
lives of managers, experts and professionals for many years, its level of intensity
and pervasiveness has grown exponentially as they have been forced to accept
major disruptions to their core expectations about employment security, career
trajectories and performance requirements. They find themselves operating in cor-
porate hierarchies and cultures which seem to lack any kind of bureaucratic con-
sistency or normative cohesion and are increasingly driven by unaccountable and
random opportunism where the only thing which matters is meeting whatever tar-
gets your superiors, however temporarily and grudgingly, favour. Experts are by no
means immune to this pervasive corporate culture and practice of ‘organized irre-
sponsibility’ because ‘professional training is not a control against the imposition
of particularistic world views’ (Vaughan 1996: 63) – especially in institutional envi-
ronments and organizational settings where amoral and deviant corporate behav-
iour has become normalized as what is routinely expected if one is to survive,
much less prosper, within a Darwinian struggle for existence.
Expert occupational groups are both architects and victims of this deepening
sense of ‘ontological insecurity’ throughout private and public sector corporations
in that they play a key role in designing and operating the expert systems and or-
ganizational technologies through which ‘low trust/high control’ regimes and rela-
tions are institutionalized, while finding themselves increasingly subjected to the
very same governance and surveillance systems ostensibly directed at others.
Fletcher (1973: 156) provided, over four decades ago, a somewhat apocalyptic but
nonetheless powerful vision of what corporate life would look like in a world
where ‘ontological insecurity/organized irresponsibility’ has become so culturally
pervasive and structurally embedded:
… within the company, the intricate and delicate management structure will disappear and be
replaced by a managerial atmosphere in which highly paid experts execute precise control,
observation, and distraction tasks for their masters’ using machines which also control them-
selves. By attrition, redundancy, unionization, or revolution managers will be finished, and
managers themselves are facilitating their own end.
92
Chapter 4: Decomposition

Allowing for a degree of poetic license, what Fletcher is evoking here is a sense of
expert groups right across the occupational spectrum encompassing managers,
professionals, technicians, scientists, engineers, designers and administrators be-
coming architects of their own demise because they ‘have now turned upon them-
selves, and the professions, those last citadels of independence and humanity, are
now subject to continuous erosion’ (Anthony 1977: 299). As Mizruchi (2013) and oth-
ers (Snyder 2016) have argued, by the mid-1980s the socio-political contract be-
tween the state, organized labour, and the banks which had constrained American
corporate elites in the post-1945 era was no longer providing an effective form of
countervailing power. Similar developments occurred in other Anglo-American po-
litical economies and welfare states in which the political coalitions and economic
deals that shaped post-1945 societies became weaker to the extent that they had ef-
fectively collapsed by the 1980s.
Professions and other expert occupations were very much part of this post-
1945 socio-political contract and alignment which held more aggressive and author-
itarian ideologies and movements in check and enabled them to construct and sus-
tain a viable legitimation strategy by effectively linking together ‘knowledge exclu-
sion’ and ‘jurisdictional closure’. But the demise of this political consensus and the
social contract it legitimated released a powerful set of ideological, economic and
cultural forces in which experts would be forced to ‘supp with the devil’ in order to
ensure the endemic instability and insecurity it entailed would not overwhelm
them, but at a price – that is, at the price of compromising their independence,
autonomy and authority in the furtherance of more short term, tactical goals relat-
ed to resilience and survivability.
Paying this price seems even more of a political necessity when the capacity
of experts to deal effectively with the ‘wicked problems’ (Ferlie et al. 2013) and ‘un-
predictable risks’ (Beck 1999) modern societies face is increasingly open to ques-
tion by ruling elites and the public at large. What we might call a ‘political perfor-
mance’ – that is, the ability to mount a show which outwardly demonstrates
problem-solving expertise without necessarily delivering on the practical and
measurable outcomes which the latter promises – seems to the best that experts
can do when the dominant corporate culture is one in which business requires
no wider moral or political justification beyond demonstrating high level share-
holder value to which any notion of ‘professional ethics or judgement’ must be
subordinated (Grace 2014).
Yet, to whom or what are we to turn except to ‘the experts’ when we find our-
selves faced by existential challenges and threats that remind us of the inherently
precarious and perilous lives which most of the people live? Rebuilding the cogni-
tive and epistemological consensus around which expert knowledge and skill can
be socially accepted, if not institutionally legitimated, seems more vital than ever

(Young and Muller 2014; Collins et al. 2020). However, this can only be possible if
based on a socially and politically realistic understanding of how this might be ach-
ieved in the light of the ways in which both the context and content of expertise
has been transformed by the changes documented in this and other chapters of
this book.
Living with deepening ‘ontological insecurity’ is now an existential reality for
growing numbers of expert occupational groups as they struggle to come to terms
with the deleterious impact of the structural changes documented in previous sec-
tions of this chapter. However, how they attempt to mediate and moderate these
deleterious impacts is considered in the following section.
3 Mediating Mechanisms
Three mediating mechanisms through which the decomposition of established ex-
pert authority has been interpreted and moderated are discussed below.
First, the emergence of more opportunistic strategies entailing the partial
decoupling and dilution of ‘epistemological exclusion’ and ‘jurisdictional closure’
examined in previous chapters. Second, a more sustained organizational focus
on tactical brokering combining both collaborative and competitive behaviours
rather than looking for dominant positioning within selected jurisdictional do-
mains. Third, a more concentrated collective effort around boundary manage-
ment processes and practices entailing the acceptance of lower levels of institu-
tional legitimation and organizational control.
Overall, these mediating mechanisms seem to involve collective adjustments
on the part of contemporary occupational groups engaged in the struggle to ach-
ieve social recognition as ‘experts’ to the very different cultural and political real-
ities which they now face as a result of the structural changes generating the de-
composition of the expert division of labour reviewed in the previous section of
this chapter.
3.1 Opportunistic Strategies
One way in which expert occupational groups have responded to the decomposi-
tion of the expert division of labour and the decay in institutionalized forms of ex-
pert authority which the latter has produced is by undertaking a series of incre-
mental, pragmatic shifts towards closure strategies aimed at partial control
through limited incursion rather than monopoly control through dominant coloni-
zation. Indeed, the increasing emphasis on occupational licensing, rather than for-
94
Chapter 4: Decomposition

malized professional accreditation, which Kirkpatrick et al. (2021) detect can be
read as a key empirical indicator of this shift towards less ambitious and more re-
strained expert closure strategies, as well as a tacit acknowledgement of the more
fragmented institutional fields in which they are located.
Although developed, conceptually, with a macro-level focus on the modern
state in mind, Fligstein and McAdam’s (2012) ‘theory of fields’ offers a way of inter-
preting this underlying trajectory towards opportunistic and limited expert closure
strategies as a collective response to the relatively unstable political context in
which they are operating. Within the latter, inter-occupational power dynamics be-
come more complex as expert occupational groups jockey for position and advant-
age more aggressively but within a more unsettled and open-ended political envi-
ronment in which outcomes are even more uncertain and temporary. As a result,
the ‘strategic action field’ which the contemporary expert division of labour con-
stitutes is likely to become less dependent upon domination structures formally le-
gitimating the power and control of elite occupational groups, like the established
or independent professions, and more reflective of shifting balances of power and
control between ‘usurper’ or ‘challenger’ groups engaged in a smorgasbord of com-
petitive and cooperative behaviours.
In his original work on professionalization as an ongoing process through
which occupations compete to control areas of organizational work, Abbott
(1988) conceptualizes ‘jurisdictional domains’ as linking abstract specialist knowl-
edge and everyday work practices. The latter emerge out of the strategies and tac-
tics which different occupational groups engage in to open, occupy, contain and su-
pervise areas of work activity within organizational settings by making effective
performance of the latter dependant on the expertise which they provide. But
he is very keen to stress that ‘jurisdictional boundaries are perpetually in dispute,
both in local practice and national claims. It is the history of jurisdictional disputes
that is the real, determining history of the professions’ (Abbott 1988: 2). He also re-
minds us that:
… any occupation can obtain licensure (e.g., beauticians) or develop abstract codes (e.g., real
estate). But only a knowledge system governed by abstractions can redefine its problems and
tasks, defend them from interlopers, and seize new problems – as medicine has recently
seized alcoholism, mental illness, hyperactivity in children, obesity, and numerous other
things. Abstraction enables survival in the competitive system of professions (Abbott 1988: 9).
Thus, to stand any chance in the struggle to establish effective control over the ju-
risdictional domains through which ‘expert’ authority, and particularly ‘professio-
nal’ authority, are accomplished and reproduced, occupational groups must pos-
sess abstract knowledge and technical skills which are organizationally relevant
within constantly changing socio-historical contexts. Through this process of trans-

lating abstract, esoteric knowledge into organizationally usable and adaptable ‘in-
tervention packages’ through which ‘problems’ can be identified, diagnosed and
treated, expert occupational groups place themselves in a better position to secure
and retain jurisdictional closure over areas of work on which their power and au-
thority depends.
While professional association and regulation can be seen as the most devel-
oped form of jurisdictional closure and control – in terms of the formal institution-
alization it achieves – all expert groups can be seen as being engaged in the com-
petitive struggle to link ‘knowledge’ and ‘work’ through organizational strategies
and tactics which effectively translate abstract, codified understanding into flexi-
ble, situationally-relevant practices. However, if they are to succeed, and continue
to succeed, within the ongoing struggle to construct domains of work activity
through which ‘expertise’ can be recognized and authorized, occupational groups
must ensure ‘they’ retain effective control over the ‘translation process’ whereby
the political potential inherent in abstract, specialized knowledge is turned into ac-
tual, ‘on the ground’ organizational power and influence. Indeed, success in the
ongoing struggle to secure and retain control over jurisdictional domains by max-
imizing the organizational power potential contained in abstract knowledge sys-
tems and technologies is vital in a socio-historical context in which the expert di-
vision of labour has become even more fragmented and political and economic
elites, egged-on by populist sentiments and movements, have become more openly
suspicious of and hostile to the ‘professionalized state’. In Fligstein and McAdam’s
(2012) terms, both ‘established’, and ‘challenger’ occupational groups are now
operating within strategic action fields in which much lower levels of formal insti-
tutional structuring and regulative governance are generating more unstable con-
texts in which tactical jockeying for position and influence within and over juris-
dictional domains are becoming more pragmatic and opportunistic.
Several research studies, broadly undertaken within the remit of a ‘decompo-
sition narrative’, illustrate the emergence and growing significance of more short-
term, opportunistic closure strategies focused on occupational control over juris-
dictional domains within work organizations and their partial decoupling from
long term legitimation strategies in which ‘epistemological exclusion’ through
state-supported professional accreditation and association has played the central
role.
Abbott’s (1988) analytical focus on jurisdictional struggles over areas of work-
place practice and relations in which knowledge-led competency and effective-
ness claims by competing occupational groups are the primary determinants of
how successful control strategies are likely to be is reflected in recent field level
and organizational level research by Newman (2013), Noordegraaf (2015), Sturdy,
Wright and Wylie (2017), Liu (2020), and VanHeuvlen (2020).

Chapter 4: Decomposition

Newman’s (2013) research on the political and organizational realignments
that UK public service professionals, managers and technocrats are being forced
to make as a result of the tighter imposition of neoliberal-type NPM regimes illus-
trates the increasing importance of reconciling competing institutional logics
based on market competition, administrative regulation and occupational differen-
tiation. Her work also documents the growing complexity and porosity of occupa-
tionally based jurisdictional boundaries within UK public services as the need to
meet, or at least placate, state-imposed policy imperatives and the heightened or-
ganizational tensions this generates work their way through governance and man-
agement systems striving to absorb the escalating demands made upon them.
In a similar vein, Noordegraaf ’s (2015) research documents the increasing hy-
bridization of ‘organizational’ and ‘occupational’ forms of professionalism and the
increasingly dominant role played by the former as greater numbers of professio-
nals and experts, across both the public and private sectors, find themselves sub-
ject to corporate governance and managerial regimes hostile to institutional logics
grounded in conceptions of self-regulation and autonomous working practices. He
also sees this hybridizing dynamic as diluting and weakening the jurisdictional
boundaries and barriers between expert occupational groups as they struggle to
contain the organizational pressures and managerial demands for internal ration-
alization and realignment which the former necessarily contains.While significant
elements of ‘occupational professionalism’ will remain, such as collegiate work cul-
tures and identities, these will be much more highly constrained by corporate level
determined surveillance and control regimes in which the power of expert groups
to resist them will indelibly shape the overall organization of jurisdictional do-
mains which emerges from these ongoing struggles.
Sturdy, Wright and Wylie’s (2017) comparative research study focuses on the
emergence of ‘consultant managers’ out of the jurisdictional struggles between var-
ious expert occupational groups embedded within increasingly constraining and
demanding ‘neo-bureaucratic’ corporations in which the political and administra-
tive drive to ‘de-differentiate’ existing occupational specializations and silos is par-
amount. Their research reveals how difficult it can be for knowledge-based occu-
pational groups to sustain jurisdictional boundaries within institutional fields and
organizational settings which are relatively ‘open’ and ‘fuzzy’ in relation to the em-
phasis given to commercial application and the inherent vulnerability of establish-
ed work domains to competitor incursion. Thus, consultant managers were able to
engage in various opportunistic strategies and tactics to take advantage of the shift-
ing occupational boundaries which neo-bureaucratic organizational forms encour-
aged in their emphasis on multi-functional project teams geared to the develop-
ment and implementation of commercially successful products and services and
the eradication, or at least dilution, of functional divisions and specialization.

97

But the very same openness and fuzziness of occupational jurisdictions under neo-
bureaucracy meant that the challenges which emerging ‘consultant manager
teams’ were able to mount against the jurisdictions of established expert manage-
ment groups in engineering, accounting, finance and human resources, putatively
lacking their ‘consultancy knowledge and skills’, only resulted in temporary ‘juris-
dictional realignments’ exposed to reappropriation by the latter.
Overall, Sturdy, Wright and Wylie’s (2017) study reveals a very high level of ex-
pert occupational instability and intra-organizational political tensions in which
control over jurisdictional domains and the ‘identity-building’ opportunities that
it offered were vulnerable to counterattack within the hybridity of neo-bureauc-
racy. Yet, as the latter becomes increasingly prevalent, if not dominant, as the un-
derlying organizational logic on which contemporary private and public sector cor-
porations are structured, then the best that expert occupations can hope for within
the ongoing struggle to close and control jurisdictional domains is a form of ‘cor-
porate professionalism’ lacking the close integration between ‘legitimation’ and
‘closure’ strategies characteristic of the independent or established professions.
Liu (2020) and VanHeuvelen’s (2020) research case studies on inter-occupation-
al jurisdictional competition in healthcare organizations involving managers and
professionals illustrate the increasing importance of workplace-level closure and
control where the increasing complexity and tensions generated through the im-
position of private sector business logics must be accommodated some way or an-
other.
Liu (2020) focuses on the ways in which professionals manage the threat of ‘im-
purities’ in the performance of their roles as a way of protecting their expertise
from dilution and a corresponding challenge to their autonomy. Whether from cli-
ents, other professionals, organizational managers, or political agencies, professio-
nals face the constant threat of their ‘purity’ being compromised or sullied by the
increasing dominance of market-based and bureaucratically based institutional
logics that potentially undermine their autonomy and control. He advocates a
much more pragmatic approach to the understanding of the social and organiza-
tional realities of professional task performance in which boundaries must be con-
tinually policed and repaired if autonomy and self-management is to be preserved,
even in a highly attenuated form.
VanHeuvelen’s (2020) research documents the ways in which shifts in working
practices within healthcare organizations, with specific reference to professional
roles and relationships in neonatal intensive care, impacted on professional au-
tonomy based upon jurisdictional closure and control. By focusing on the ‘articu-
lation work’ in which professionals, and other expert occupations, are routinely
involved – that is, identifying and mapping the co-ordination work which is need-
ed to bring together the diverse and often complex tasks that are required to de-
98
Chapter 4: Decomposition

liver plans and projects – she highlights the vital role of ‘articulation work practi-
ces’ in shaping the jurisdictional claims and domains on which expert groups rely
to establish and defend their internal autonomy against external control. This ar-
ticulation work and the relative expert autonomy which it makes possible are con-
tinually under threat from wider structural movements in policy and employment
regimes because they have a major blurring effect on the established divisions and
boundaries within existing hierarches of tasks through which co-ordination is ach-
ieved and legitimated.
3.2 Organizational Focus
Each of the research studies reviewed in the previous section highlight the grow-
ing emphasis on organizational level gains and loses within the competitive strug-
gle to create, close and control expert jurisdictional domains combining collabora-
tive and conflictual strategies and tactics. They document a shift in analytical focus
away from societal level legitimation strategies built on formal accreditation and
trust building and towards the field and organizational level politics in which ex-
pert occupational groups are now routinely engaged as they strive to establish and
protect jurisdictional domains increasingly exposed and vulnerable to external
shits in policy, governance and opinion.
In this way, they trace the trajectory of an underlying move towards much
greater political realism and opportunistic pragmatism on the part of occupational
groups living in a world where ‘hanging on to what you’ve got’ by the way of cor-
porate recognition and organizational status as ‘experts’ becomes more pressing
than the aggressive search for new jurisdictional domains through the legitimation
strategies previously followed by mature or elite professions such as medicine and
law. This is particularly the case if the latter are finding themselves increasingly
exposed to political, economic, technological and cultural pressures challenging
the relatively high levels of autonomy and control they have enjoyed for much
of the preceding century. As Heusinkveld et al. (2018: 259) conclude, intra-organiza-
tional level research has demonstrated the intensification of the jurisdictional
struggles through which expert occupational boundaries are ‘delineated, contested
and repaired and how they connect to different organizational processes and
outcomes.’ It has also helped us to better understand ‘how new forms of expertise
evolve and vary across different social groups [and provided] critical insight into
the extent to which new occupations are (de) institutionalized’ (Heusinkveld et al.
2018: 259).
However, it is vitally important to remember that this marked shift of empha-
sis towards intra-organizational jurisdictional struggles signals a partial decou-
3 Mediating Mechanisms
99

pling of legitimation strategies focused on epistemological exclusion and cognitive
monopoly within ‘labour market shelters’ (Freidson 2001) from closure tactics
geared to organizational control over the interrelated task domains through
which ‘organizational work gets done’. As the extant expert division of labour
has become more differentiated and fragmented, so the ongoing workplace level
jurisdictional conflicts between an ever-increasing number of occupational groups
claiming expert status and authority have intensified to an extent where winning
or losing intra-organizational domain struggles is more important (at least for
now!) than external societal recognition.
This is not an ‘either or’ situation, but more of ‘Hobson’s choice’ prioritizing
between equally unpalatable options within an increasingly complex and unstable
institutional environment in which challenges and threats come along more often
than buses. It’s about the changing balance between external regulative recogni-
tion and legitimation as opposed to internal competitive success and the relatively
advantageous ‘jurisdictional settlements’ it bestows on certain expert occupational
groups. As Abbott (1988: 59) continually reminds us, ‘in order to claim jurisdiction a
profession must ask society to recognize its cognitive structure through exclusive
rights’ over the work domains in which it practices and to seek further support
for these labour market privileges in relation to the legal system, government reg-
ulation and the ‘court of public appeal’. But in a world in which market competi-
tion, technological rationalization, state supported ‘reregulation’ and populist re-
volt has come to dominate the political and institutional landscape on which
jurisdictional struggles must be fought out, then winning the intra-organizational
battles to control the work domains through which expert status is achieved and
sustained assumes political primacy over incremental successes in occupational li-
censing and related forms of administrative regulation.
3.3 Boundary Management
Marking and setting demarcation lines between different forms of work practice
and the potential control over work activities lying within their boundaries
which they bestow has been central to the decomposition narrative as it has un-
folded in this chapter. Treating this demarcating work as ‘boundary management’,
offers further insight into the organizational processes through which occupation-
al groups strive to claim specialist expertise and the advantages and rewards that
it conveys to those groups who are successful in establishing and maintaining rec-
ognition and identification as ‘experts.’ Effective boundary management emerges
as an essential prerequisite for success in the competitive struggle to achieve
and sustain expert status, especially when the latter has become even more ‘Dar-
100
Chapter 4: Decomposition

winian’ in its scope and intensity. Degradation of long established ‘mature’ or ‘elite’
expert jurisdictional domains, never mind of more emergent and embryonic do-
mains, seems an ever-present possibility within an institutional environment char-
acterized by Darwinian struggles for survival in which previous settlements over
jurisdictional rights and privileges are no guarantee that your occupational group
is safe from incursion and erosion from competitors.
Constructing and policing jurisdictional boundaries between different areas of
work activity, within a more splintered and porous expert division of labour where
boundary disputes are likely to be a more regular occurrence and boundary settle-
ments less formal and stable, becomes a critical factor in determining the success
or failure of ‘expert mobility projects.’ By fabricating and monitoring boundaries
around work domains and the technologies through which the activities contained
within them are made possible, occupational groups can mount and defend ‘expert
mobility projects’ with a relatively high chance of succeeding. This is particularly
true if these technologies and the practices they make possible are of critical im-
portance to long-term organizational survival and growth within institutional
fields and environments in which competitively generated complexity and uncer-
tainty are preeminent.
A considerable body of organizational and occupational research dating
back to the 1950s/60s supports this argument that effective boundary management
at workplace and labour market levels, particularly if they are well-integrated
through interlinked external regulative strategies and internal organizational pol-
itics, are pivotal in creating jurisdictional domains from which ‘real’ occupational
power and control can emerge (Blau 1955; Crozier 1964; Selznick 1949/1966; Child
1973, 2019; Peck 1996; Reed 2011).While the formal regulation of these jurisdictional
domains through occupational licensing and/or professional accreditation can help
stabilize the patterns of occupational power and control which they confer, bureau-
cratic formalization and standardization are not essential preconditions for mobi-
lizing effective ‘expert mobility projects’ in which political support from governing
elites and civil society is more important to long-term success (Larson 2013; Saks
2021).
More recent research and analysis has focused on what Abbott (1988) and,
as we have previously mentioned, Liu (2020) conceptualize as the relative ‘purity’
of different jurisdictional domains and how successful the expert occupational
groups occupying and controlling them have been in managing boundaries to min-
imize the presence and impact of ‘impurities.’
Building on Abbott’s (1988) analysis of the forms of ‘impurity’ evident in pro-
fessional work, Liu (2020) argues that taking the latter seriously helps us to develop
a more socially realistic understanding of how important jurisdictional boundary
management is to sustain the status and identity of expert occupational groups as
3 Mediating Mechanisms
101

‘professionals.’ Abbott (1988) identifies five different forms of ‘impurity’ in relation
to the content of the expertise claimed by an occupational group, the strength of its
jurisdictional boundaries, the nature of its client base, the degree of organizational
constraints to which its work performance is subjected, and the extent to which
societal and institutional politics impinge on its capacity to engage in behaviours
moving beyond the prevailing status quo. While Abbott sees all five forms of im-
purity as being driven by the need for all expert occupational groups claiming pro-
fessional status to minimize, if not eradicate, ‘dirty work’ – that is, elements in
their work roles and contexts which dilute their capacity to resist and control con-
tact with ‘pollutants’ such as disorderly clients or external management control –
Liu (2020) argues these impurities are inherent in all types of professional/expert
work. Indeed, he maintains that these impurities, even within the most prestigious
and elite status forms of professional work such as medicine and law, are structur-
ally embedded in the work roles and performances of all expert occupational
groups and their retention can prove advantageous to the latter.
His analysis suggests that this is the case particularly in relation to ‘expertise
impurities’ and ‘jurisdictional impurities’ because all forms of expertise depend on
a hybrid combination of abstract knowledge and technical skill if they are to be
effective in real-world problem-solving situations and work task boundaries de-
pend on a range of negotiated settlements which always leave some discretionary
leeway as to which occupational group has intellectual and advisory priority. As
he concludes (Liu 2020: 153) in relation to the latter, all ‘intellectual and advisory
jurisdictions are characterized by porous boundaries and precarious control’. Con-
tra Abbott, even elite professional jurisdictional domains have to accept and con-
tain ‘impurities’ if those groups claiming this prestigious status and the authority
which goes with it are to be successful in legitimating the rights and privileges as-
sociated with this kind of high-status work. This is even more the case once we
move outside the relatively rarefied political contexts and cultural atmospheres
in which established or mature professions and professionals operate and enter
the even more contested, polluted and unstable institutional environments and or-
ganizational settings in which the majority of expert and ‘expert-aspirant’ occupa-
tional groups reside.
4 Substantive Outcomes
Filtered through the mediating mechanisms identified in the previous sections of
this chapter, the decomposition narrative traces the emergence of much more
complex ‘expert ecologies’ within which the escalating environmental pressures
imposed on expert occupational groups has generated hybridized forms of work
102
Chapter 4: Decomposition

and authority better adapted to the instabilities and uncertainties which the latter
now routinely encounter and experience in the course of their working days and
lives.
While accepting elements of the analysis provided by those working within
the de-legitimation and demystification narratives, decomposition theorists insist
that both fundamentally underestimate the strength of the underlying adaptive
mechanisms which allow expert ecologies to self-correct and restabilize even in
the face of threats that seem to challenge their very survival as viable complex sys-
tems. Kirkpatrick et al.’s (2021) rebuttal of ‘grand narrative theorizing’ anticipating
the demise, or at least dilution, of professionalism as the dominant mode of expert
occupational regulation rests on a competing ‘grand narrative’ of an underlying
evolutionary logic in which the continuing empirical strength of voluntary certifi-
cation and licensing supportive of professional associations across the occupation-
al spectrum in the US is accounted for by the path-dependent, endogenous and
self-reinforcing nature of professional regulation and the ‘certification ecosystem’
that it reproduces. This self-correcting and reinforcing expert ecosystem meets the
needs and interests of various employer and governmental stakeholder groups,
whilst also sustaining the institutional logic through which this underlying con-
tinuity in regulative forms can be maintained. Continuity in professionalized
modes of occupational regulation is guaranteed by the evolutionary-cum-function-
alist theoretical logic on which its institutional reproduction is predicated. The em-
pirical, statistical analysis evidencing the institutional reproduction of professional
regulation is already anticipated by the explanatory precepts which frame the evo-
lutionary trajectory that the latter must follow. Anything other outcome, indicative
of a more dislocated, declining, or non-linear trajectory, cannot be anticipated,
much less embraced, because this would contradict the theoretical ‘domain as-
sumptions’ (Gouldner 1971; Reed 1985) on which evolutionary institutionalism is in-
tellectually founded and legitimated.
Thus, the ‘evolutionary institutionalism’ on which much of the decomposition
narrative intellectually trades is, in turn, based on a complexity theory approach to
occupational and organizational analysis (Padgett and Powell 2012) in which ‘agen-
cy’, ‘power’, and ‘politics’ are conspicuous by their absence. Complexity theory
gives overriding explanatory primacy to self-organizing dynamics within highly in-
teractive and nonhomogeneous systems in which loops, and cycles of self-reinforc-
ing transformation ensure organizations and occupations discover ‘new purposes
for old tools’ (Padgett and Powell 2012: 12) – such as reworking occupational licens-
ing as a revitalized mechanism for sustaining professional regulation (Kirkpatrick
et al. 2021). This approach seems to remove ‘much of the power, conflict, disruption,
and social class variables from the analysis of social processes [because] it search-
4 Substantive Outcomes
103

es for ecological laws that transcend the hubbub that sociology should attend to’
(Perrow 1986: 213).
Within the decomposition narrative, occupational and organizational hybrid-
ization is explained as the outcome of self-correcting and reinforcing adaptive
processes driven by impersonal ecological evolution without very much, if any, ref-
erence to the wider ‘structures of dominancy’ (Anter 2014) in which the latter are
embedded. It tends to retreat into a form of evolutionary institutionalism based on
life science derived biological metaphors and modes of theorizing presuming that
change, innovation and transformation can be subsumed within self-organizing
complex systems subject to generic evolutionary imperatives beyond the power
and control of individual or collective agents. Analytically stripped of any serious
explanatory interest in how power struggles between individual and collective
agents shape and reshape the contested terrain which constitutes expert ecologies,
decomposition theory ‘smooths out the wrinkles’ in the latter to a point where they
all but disappear within an evolutionary logic in which ‘all will, indeed must, be
well’.
5 Conclusion
As we have seen throughout this chapter, the decomposition narrative offers an en-
dogenously driven explanation of the evolutionary pressures which have impacted
on the expert division of labour in ways that simultaneously destabilize and resta-
bilize expert authority to produce much more hybridized and inherently complex
expert ecologies.
In terms of the history of ideas, the intellectual roots of the decomposition nar-
rative can be traced back to debates over ‘de-professionalisation’ in the 1980s and
1990s in which professionalized modes of work and regulation were deemed to be
under increasing threat from the escalating pressures exerted by technological, or-
ganizational and cultural change (Abbott 1988; Derber et al. 1990; Burns 2019; Saks
2021). On the one side, there was a group of radical theorists and analysts who
saw an unstoppable rationalizing, deskilling and routinizing dynamic at work
that would inevitably weaken, probably fatally, the material foundations and insti-
tutional supports on which ‘professionalism’ depended for its cogency and legiti-
macy as the primary mechanism for organizing and regulating expert work. On
the other side, a group of researchers and analysts who insisted, in stark contrast,
that professionalism was much more structurally and ideologically resilient than
‘the radicals’ were prepared to accept because they fundamentally underestimated
its capacity to change and adapt incrementally in order to absorb immediate and
longer-term threats to its survival.
104
Chapter 4: Decomposition

As we have seen throughout this chapter, the decomposition narrative has its
intellectual roots in the second, ‘incremental adaptation’ school of thought on the
future of professionalised modes of expert work organization and regulation –
even in the face of greater threats from new technologies, political ideologies
and cultural shifts than those identified as potential dangers over four decades
ago.While recognizing that the contemporary expert division of labour has become
ever more fragmented and fractionalized over this time, the decomposition narra-
tive is secure in its judgement that expert-based forms of authority and regulation,
including hybridized modes of professionalism which depart in several crucial re-
spects from the orthodox model (Noordegraaf 2015, 2020), are resilient enough to
‘weather the storm’ and to emerge even stronger out the other side.
Whether or not this underlying optimism over the medium and longer-term
prospects for expert authority, in its increasingly hybridized forms, is justified is
a question to which we will return in a subsequent chapter of this book. Suffice
to say at this juncture in our exposition of the decomposition narrative, adaptive
evolutionary processes may reach a point at which ‘the system’ to which they refer
may become unrecognizable from that which preceded it. Expert authority may
become, over time, so dispersed, diluted and degraded that its essential identifying
characteristics as a distinctive social, occupational and organizational form com-
pletely decompose into an unrelated mass of scattered elements.

Chapter 5: Covid-19 – A Case Study on Expert
Authority
1 Introduction
In this chapter, we assess the three narratives regarding the demise in expert au-
thority as outlined in the preceding three chapters ‘in action’ in how the Covid-19
pandemic and its relationship to experts and expertise developed. Why look at the
pandemic as a particular case study? Well as Tooze (2021) highlights, this constitut-
ed the first crisis of the Anthropocene era and in a lot of respects showed our in-
ability to cope all that well. Consequently, it is an appropriate domain in which to
examine the role of expert authority and its ability to operate to help manage a
global crisis such as a pandemic.
Equally, ‘an event such as a pandemic is revelatory, but much of what it re-
veals are deep lying structures and hierarchies, which are denied or obscured dur-
ing periods of stability’ (Davies et al. 2022: 5). Therefore, the pandemic allows us to
consider what these narratives around expert authority reveal once experts are
put into a crisis rather than stable context. Whilst it posed a new challenge to ex-
pert authority, how different countries reacted to the pandemic also revealed some
of the issues around expert authority that were already circulating in these narra-
tives we identify.
Finally, when it comes to experts and expertise it has also become clear that
the world was quite well-equipped with information from experts on how to
deal with a pandemic from an early stage. For instance, by the end of January
2020, we knew:
… about the clinical progression, who was most at risk, how it was spreading, what health
systems should be prepared for, potential asymptomatic transmission, the incubation period,
the best strategy for containing spread and estimates of R0 for the virus. Adding this infor-
mation to the emerging information from WHO on China’s response provided a pretty robust
picture on what other countries would be facing … (Sridhar 2022: 76)
Nevertheless, there was a lot of deviation in response from different countries, sug-
gesting the authority and subsequent use of that expertise matters.
The chapter begins by taking each narrative on the demise of expert authority
in turn and considers how that narrative has emerged in the context of the pan-
demic. Then, the chapter considers what these narratives ‘in action’ mean for ex-
perts in the future – identifying the core dilemma expert authority contended with
between the potential for re-legitimation or equally politicisation. Towards the end
https://doi.org/10.1515/9783110734911-006

of the chapter, we begin to consider what the pandemic suggests for how experts
and authority can be re-imagined (and the risks this still poses).
2 The Three Narratives on Expert Authority ‘in Action’ during
the Pandemic
In this section of the chapter, we assess to what extent each of the three narratives
help us to understand and explain the role which experts played in interpreting,
mediating, and managing the threats which the pandemic entailed – both globally
and locally.We take each narrative in turn and look at the evidence for it in action
during the pandemic. Some of these narratives lend themselves to a more global
focus and for others a more local focus is pertinent to show the depth and detail
of how expert authority had to contend with other stakeholders that were also in-
terpreting and managing the pandemic. At junctures, specific aspects of the pan-
demic come under the spotlight such as advice on masks, use of vaccines, and
the notion of herd immunity. Overall, this analysis demonstrates that expert au-
thority was at different times, in different locations, and in different ways, delegi-
timated, drawn into more technocratic governance structures, and fragmented/div-
ided.
2.1 De-legitimation and Covid-19
During the pandemic, the de-legitimation of expert authority was seen in various
different locations across the globe and often centred around the behaviour of po-
litical leaders and government institutions and the use of social media to provide
‘alternative narratives’ of events.
Whilst China eventually responded well to the pandemic, it’s initial stance to
the emergence of Covid was to delegitimate its own experts, publicly condemning
those that observed a new illness was spreading in the country and silencing them,
to try and contain the problem before the world found out. This came to the fore
with the death of whistle-blower Dr Li, a 33-year-old doctor that died from Covid
after being publicly admonished by the Chinese government for releasing informa-
tion about this new disease with a Chinese and global outcry in the wake of his
death (Sridhar 2022). Ironically, it was scientists (within China and in other geog-
raphies) working together through the scholarly publishing system that navigated
the Chinese government’s crackdown on information coming out of the country at
the start of its pandemic (Farrar 2021) to begin to equip other countries with key
information to help them contain the disease.

Beyond the initial outbreak, de-legitimation of experts was most evident in
countries led by more populist right-wing governments with obvious examples
being President Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil and former President Donald Trump in
the US. In the US, before Covid arrived Trump had shut down several pandemic
response programmes established by his predecessor President Barack Obama
(Sridhar 2022). Other instances of de-legitimation would include: Trump announc-
ing a halt in funding of the World Health Organization because he felt it had played
a significant role in the poor management of the pandemic (British Broadcasting
Corporation [BBC] 2020)¹, his pronouncements regarding the potential benefits
of UV sunlight and disinfectant injections to combat the virus (Broad and Levin
2020), and his treatment of Dr Fauci² once he started to criticise the US response
to the pandemic (LeBlanc 2020) as well as other health officials (Diamond and LeB-
lanc 2020). Trump openly, ‘rejected various evidence-supported measures to com-
bat COVID-19, including distancing, test and trace, and masking and instead encour-
aged people to protest against [state enforced] lockdown rules’ (Sridhar 2022: 170),
which eventually led to his removal from Twitter.
As well as individual expert advisers, expert institutions were also in Trump’s
firing line. For instance, the CDC³ was regularly side-lined and decried by Trump
for how seriously it was taking the pandemic. As Sridhar (2022: 172) points out:
For the H1N1 (swine flu) crisis in 2009, the CDC held 32 out of 35 press conferences in the first
thirteen weeks of the pandemic. By contrast, Trump led 75 per cent of the 69 press conferen-
ces held in the first thirteen weeks of COVID-19.
Therefore, Trump was key in ensuring that expert organisations could not be as
vocal as him about how to manage the pandemic. In fact, former directors of
the organisation took to the Washington Post in July 2020 to highlight how the
Trump administration was undermining their guidelines and efforts in informing
the nation’s response to the pandemic, particularly in relation to school re-open-
ings (Sridhar 2022).
Overall, research ‘tracked more than 400 cases of the Trump administration’s
efforts to restrict or dismiss scientific research or evidence’ (Sridhar 2022: 174). As a
result, as the Editor of the medical journal The Lancet Richard Horton observes:
The story of COVID-19 in the US is one of the strangest paradoxes of the whole pandemic. No
other country in the world has the concentration of scientific skill, technical knowledge and
productive capacity possessed by the US. It is the world’s scientific superpower bar none. And

yet this colossus of science utterly failed to bring its expertise successfully to bear on the pol-
icy and politics of the nation’s response. (Horton 2020: 46–47)
De-legitimation of expert authority has played a significant role in these develop-
ments in the US and has only been quelled by the election of Joe Biden to the Pres-
idency and his alternate response (Maxmen and Subbaraman 2021).
Likewise, Bolsonaro has delegitimated expertise regarding the pandemic; reg-
ularly questioning the severity of the virus, breaking his own government’s rules
on social distancing (Phillips et al. 2020), potentially circulating misinformation
about Covid-19 (Harris 2020), firing three Health Ministers during the crisis (Phil-
lips 2021), and facing a severe death toll from the disease. Brazil therefore wit-
nessed a lack of leadership on account of the pandemic not being taken seriously
by its President, with the country instead reliant on states, municipalities, and fa-
velas trying their best to respond with little to no federal support (Sridhar 2022).
The country’s de-legitimation of experts and expertise combined with the lack
of leadership and financial support for the pandemic meant that a country that
had the capacity to prevent illness and death did not do so (Sridhar 2022).
The individual behaviour of political leaders and government personnel was
also key in the de-legitimation of experts because their behaviour could serve to
undermine the expert advice given to the public. A studied example of this is
the ‘Barnard Castle Effect’ on account of Dominic Cummings’⁴ behaviour at the
height of the pandemic in the UK in April 2020.Whilst the country was on its tough-
est lockdown with citizens told to ‘Stay at Home’ and not visit family members out-
side the home, it was revealed that Cummings whilst unwell with Covid drove from
London to Durham to stay at his parents and was then spotted with his wife (on
her birthday) at Barnard Castle which he publicly insisted was to test his eyesight
before the drive back to London. As Sridhar (2022: 152–153) explains this had far-
reaching effects:
A study in the Lancet tracked more than 40,000 people’s views and found that, over the three
weeks after the Cummings headlines, willingness to comply with restrictions dropped steeply
in England. There was no similar drop in Scotland or Wales.
Likewise, populist political leaders tended to catch the illness early on and their
behaviour in relation to this was also indicative of a de-legitimation of expert ad-
vice. For instance, Trump insisted on being photographed driving outside Walter
Reed hospital to demonstrate that Covid was not that bad an illness (infecting ev-
eryone in the car in the process). His response to his own experience of the disease
Cummings was Chief Advisor to the UK Prime Minister.

even, ‘… led some critics to suggest that he had faked getting the disease in order to
prove it wasn’t as serious a threat as scientists had claimed’ (Sridhar 2022: 173). Bol-
sonaro also tried to use his experience of catching the disease to play down its ef-
fects. He claimed to have ‘a slight fever, muscle pain and tiredness, and said that
using the drug hydroxychloroquine⁵ had cured him’ (Sridhar 2022: 225)
It’s telling that a lot of the countries where de-legitimation of experts took
place also fared the worst in their pandemic response and volume of deaths (Srid-
har 2022). They were also often the locations of the emergence of ‘variants of con-
cern’ – variants of the disease that would often supplant previous variants that
were often more transmissible each time it mutated.
In the behaviour of these governments is evidence of the institutional break-
down in trust of expert authority that the de-legitimation narrative highlights.
These populist regimes’ distrust of expertise also serves to undermine rational
civic debate, ‘… that used to go a long way towards determining our consensus re-
ality’ (Buranyi 2020: para 8). Consequently, de-legitimation in the context of Covid-
19 also evolves to become a ‘culture war’ against measures attempting to protect
public health during the pandemic where the likes of lockdown, social distancing,
and wearing a mask are constructed as constraints on individuals’ liberal rights
designed by elite experts (Geoghegan and Fitzgerald 2020; McKelvey 2020; Sridhar
2022). Coupled with this, conspiracy theories abound including the role of 5G in the
pandemic (Goodman and Carmichael 2020), anti-vaccination sentiment, dismissing
the pandemic as a hoax (Buranyi 2020), or trolling medical experts (Channel 4
News 2021). This growth in the volume and distribution of conspiracy theories
has also allowed others around wellness and health to flourish in the wake of
the pandemic (Wiseman 2022). Combined, these have served to allow populist
and far right governments or groups to reclaim the pandemic through their own
ideological lens (Krzyżanowski and Krzyżanowska 2022).
The pandemic therefore also became an ‘infodemic, ‘when people are exposed
to large quantities of both accurate and misleading information related to a health
topic’ (Gruzd et al. 2021: 2). In this context, large volumes of misinformation – false
information shared but without the intention to mislead – and disinformation –
false information shared in order to mislead (Singh and Banga 2022) – circulate
globally and at speed making it hard to fact-check and dispel. Therefore, ‘an info-
demic makes it challenging for people to know what or whom to trust, especially
when faced with conflicting claims or information’ (Gruzd et al. 2021: 2). However,
emerging research on audience reception of this information suggests that a ‘prag-
There’s no evidence this drug can cure Covid (Farrar 2021: Sridhar 2022).
110
Chapter 5: Covid-19 – A Case Study on Expert Authority

matic scepticism’ (Kyriakidou et al. 2022) is emerging in response which gives ex-
perts hope for the future.
Nevertheless, evidence collected so far suggests that public trust in govern-
ment to deal with a health emergency is highly dependent on the state’s commu-
nication with its public (Liu et al. 2022) and the infodemic, proliferation of con-
spiracy theories, and culture wars generated during the pandemic serve to
undermine trust in both the state and experts (often seen as too aligned with
them in populist ideology). However, trust is what traditional expert authority
has relied upon. Instead, distrust of government and experts (and even espoused
hatred of them at times – see Kupferschmidt 2021) has prevented the pandemic
being managed as effectively as it could have been.
A clear example would be the propensity for vaccine refusal in the US with Dr
Fauci commenting that had the spread of dis/misinformation been as prolific in
previous health crises we wouldn’t have been able to eradicate smallpox and
polio (Sridhar 2022: 161). Doctors observed that at the core of these refusals was
a general mistrust of government and questioning of authority – it was not
based on evidence and fact (Karkowsky 2021). It has led to high profile experts
within the media to express surprise and dismay at the general population’s rejec-
tion of science (e.g., Roberts 2021) with doctors talking of experiencing ‘compas-
sion fatigue’ (Karkowsky 2021), questioning why they continue to look after people
that reject medical treatment and science in some respects (i.e., vaccine) but not in
others (e.g., hospital treatment if got ill from Covid), often putting medical profes-
sionals at risk as a result.
In sum, whilst de-legitimation can often focus on extreme responses to expert
authority, they can have some fundamental consequences in the actions some gov-
ernments take and can contribute to shifting the public discourse around the pan-
demic and the role and authority of expertise. In contrast, demystification demon-
strates how government regimes can create distrust in expert authority in a more
discreet manner.
2.2 Demystification and Covid-19
To analyse demystification and the pandemic we will focus on the UK government
as it serves as a classic example of the co-option of expertise into political rhetoric
where ‘following the science’ became the buzzword phrase in daily briefings to the
population (Mathers 2020) and with it the UK government attempted to rationalise
‘the science’ and its scientists within the neoliberal governing policy regime (Cal-
vert and Arbuthnott 2021).
2 The Three Narratives on Expert Authority ‘in Action’ during the Pandemic
111

As the Director of the Wellcome Trust⁶, and member of the government’s ad-
visory group SAGE⁷, Jeremy Farrar (2021) provides an insightful first-hand account
of the relationship between expert authority and the UK government. He highlights
that in the very early stages of the pandemic it was not clear to SAGE panel mem-
bers what direction the government was seeking to take and what strategy they
were pursuing (that they would therefore need advice from SAGE on). As a result,
questions were being asked of SAGE members that weren’t in their remit (e.g.,
whether to call in the Army). By March 2020, Farrar (2021) depicts SAGE advisers
as becoming increasingly frustrated with government and more demonstrative
with them as they did not feel they were being taken seriously in terms of the
scale of death they were presenting based on the current strategy the government
was pursuing. Consequently, he argues scientific experts and academics⁸ were key
in the UK government eventually changing course and locking down.
Nevertheless, technocratic rationality was the favoured response to the pan-
demic initially where behavioural and mathematical modelling was influential
(Farrar 2021; Simons 2020; Sridhar 2022; Sodha 2020). Furthermore, the UK govern-
ment sought to focus on numbers, figures, and graphs in their daily briefings to the
population – rationalising their approach and ‘progress’ against the pandemic (Bil-
lig 2021), which was largely accepted by the UK media (Winston and Law 2021).
‘Official’ experts used by the UK government also became enveloped into the
political regime and its desire to control the messaging around the pandemic. Con-
sequently, those within SAGE (e.g., Farrar 2021) and beyond (e.g., Horton 2020; Srid-
har 2022) concede there was a lack of transparency as to who constituted SAGE,
what discussions were had within SAGE, what advice was given by the body, and
how/when/if the UK government was following any of that advice. Minutes from
SAGE meetings were not made available to the public, with Farrar (2021) insisting
that members of SAGE together with Chris Whitty, Chief Medical Officer for Eng-
land, and Patrick Vallance, Government Chief Scientific Adviser, pressured the gov-
ernment to make them public. Likewise, there are indications of other areas of dis-
connect between experts and the UK government with Farrar (2021) noting that
minutes from key meetings of SAGE in mid-March 2020 played down the urgency
and anxiousness actually present in those meetings. He also highlights that the no-
Wellcome Trust is a global charitable foundation which supports science to solve urgent health
challenges.

tinued to not pursue a national lockdown.

tion of herd immunity⁹ whilst mentioned publicly, ‘… was not something that I re-
call being explicitly recommended by SAGE or even discussed at SAGE meetings as
a strategy. Other advisers share this recollection’ (Farrar 2021: 104).
Despite this, the claim to the public continued to be that the UK government
was ‘following the science’ – a statement that increasingly became untenable
when the UK government brought England out of lockdown measures rapidly in
the Summer 2020, prevaricated on lockdown in winter 2020/1, and abandoned
most measures to contain the disease in 2021/2 (Independent SAGE 2021). Farrar
(2021: 153) is adamant that ‘Ministers were not following the science, even if
they said they were. Governments owe it to people to be clear about when they
are following advice and when they are rejecting it’ and later quit the advisory
group in October 2021.
When it became clear that the UK government hadn’t handled key aspects of
the crisis well, the medical/scientific experts were then being left to handle the
tough questions with concerns they were becoming scapegoats for political deci-
sions (Farrar 2021; Matthews 2020a; Sodha 2020; Wickham and Baker 2020). This
became apparent in some of the UK government’s subsequent criticism of scientif-
ic experts, such as former Health Secretary, Jeremy Hunt’s critique of SAGE (Payne
2020), the criticisms made of Public Health England (Campbell and Walker 2020),
and the abandonment of SAGE advice as the pandemic progressed, particularly
in the second wave onwards (Alwakeel and Demianyk 2021). It has also been the
subject of the current Conservative party leadership contest (and next UK Prime
Minister) with Rishi Sunak stating that too much power had been conceded to ex-
perts in the height of the pandemic (BBC 2022).
Horton (2020) is particularly critical regarding the transformation of experts
advising the government to technocratic functionaries, arguing that, ‘[Scientific]
advisors became the public relations wing of a government that had failed its peo-
ple’ (Horton 2020: 59). The emergence of Independent SAGE as opposed to SAGE is
also considered by Horton (2020) as an indication of elite experts’ deference to gov-
ernment where Independent SAGE was needed, as official SAGE had too many gov-
ernment employees on it and was too secretive and thus became compromised as a
trusted body of expertise. This left the British Medical Journal to observe that, ‘The
pandemic has revealed how the medical-political complex can be manipulated in
an emergency’ (Abbasi 2020: para 2).
The World Health Organization (WHO) defines herd immunity as: ‘… the indirect protection
from an infectious disease that happens when a population is immune either through vaccination
or immunity developed through previous infection. WHO supports achieving ’herd immunity’
through vaccination, not by allowing a disease to spread through any segment of the population,
as this would result in unnecessary cases and deaths’ (WHO 2020).
2 The Three Narratives on Expert Authority ‘in Action’ during the Pandemic
113

As well as the co-option of experts into political rhetoric and the technocrat-
ic neo-liberal regime, there has also been the reframing of what constitutes ‘exper-
tise’ for the UK state. It has been observed that before the pandemic, the UK was a
country with a good reputation for public health expertise and pandemic control
and yet it was not prepared when Covid struck (Sridhar 2022). Cooper and Szreter
(2021) indicate that this is on account of the fact that a lot of the previous expertise
on disease and infection control had been ‘hollowed out’ due to ‘rentier capitalism’.
Consequently, in line with the government’s approach before the pandemic, pri-
vate sector consulting expertise was sought and often dominated in the Covid strat-
egy, demonstrating, ‘quite how close the relationship between the state and those
para-state industries had grown, often outside of the public eye’ (Davies et al. 2022:
14).
Examples of this influence include the creation of the National Institute for
Health Protection comprised of largely executives from the private sector rather
than public health or medical/scientific experts (West 2020). Likewise, the UK gov-
ernment’s test and trace programme, led by former Chief Executive of TalkTalk,
Dido Harding and outsourced to private sector consulting firms rather than
using local authority skill and expertise in testing and tracing. This resulted in a
very expensive test and trace programme (£37 billion¹⁰) that never performed
well and yet it constitutes a key facet in the fight against disease control (Cooper
and Szreter 2021). Even so, private sector consulting has still been very well finan-
cially rewarded for its pandemic efforts with the likes of Deloitte awarded £280 m
of Covid related public sector contracts with 691 partners each receiving £854,000
profit share (O’Dwyer 2021). Therefore, in this context, we see neoliberal regimes
rewarding those who demonstrate ‘obedience to the ideology of the ruling elite’
(Cohen 2020: para 8) and thus the expert as ‘technocratic fixer’ is favoured, as in-
dicated by this narrative.
Ultimately, the commons inquiry into the UK government Covid response was
damning of both the government but also its expert advisors, pointing to specific
instances where poor decisions were made that evidence did not support (e.g.,
locking down late, abandoning testing early on, discharging patients back into
care homes) that the inquiry felt were a significant contribution to the UK’s
death toll (House of Commons 2021; Sample and Walker 2021).
The example of the UK government pandemic response certainly demon-
strates a more subtle relationship with expert authority, where it doesn’t seek to
publicly decry or denigrate it as seen in de-legitimation, but instead either draw

Chapter 5: Covid-19 – A Case Study on Expert Authority

it into its neo-liberal regime or outsource authority to other privatised consulting
expertise in project delivery that are often more aligned to state neoliberal inter-
ests. But this approach can still serve to question expert authority as it has been
originally conceived as well as the implicit contract and bonds of trust it relies
upon. It’s this theme of the ‘turf war’ between experts that forms the crux of
the decomposition narrative that can also be seen at work in the response to
the pandemic across the globe.
2.3 Decomposition and Covid-19
This narrative manifests in the tensions between the authority of different forms
of expertise. In relation to the pandemic, it involved an array of different forms
of expertise in order to manage a challenge of this global proportion. In turn, ten-
sions and debates emerged (sometimes at a national level and sometimes at a glob-
al level as we shall see) between different experts, particularly with respect to ad-
vice for measures to protect populations from illness, thus presenting expert
authority as more contested and fragmented.
As seen in the previous section, one particular area of fragmentation and fis-
sure in the UK, has been between ‘corporate professionals’ from the likes of man-
agement consultancy versus public health or medical/scientific professionals. Con-
tracts for PPE, the production of testing kits, the testing centres and the testing
labs have increasingly been outsourced to private companies in the UK (Davies
2020b; Kinder and Plimmer 2020) and with it has been operational fragmentation
and huge difficulties in achieving overall strategic coordination and direction
(Jones 2021). This use of corporate professionals in a public health crisis has
come under greater scrutiny as the pandemic has progressed, with investigation
into procurement processes for Covid contracts (Waugh 2021a) and spending on
the likes of the UK test and trace system (Waugh 2021b). This test and trace system
struggled to cope with demand where private management consultancies rather
than public health experts on mass screening and testing have been used (Goodley
and Halliday 2020). These experts have also been side-lined for management con-
sultancy expertise in the proposed ‘operation Moonshot’ programme, with public
health experts identifying numerous problems with the proposal (Booth 2020).
There have also been tensions between different forms of expertise special-
isms that pertain to the pandemic (for example, between public health scientists,
medical scientists, economists, mathematicians, psychologists, behavioural scien-
tists – see Bourgeron 2021). This arena of fragmentation results in highlighting
the endemic complexity and opacity of the development of expertise and knowl-
edge, where the public begins to realise that ‘science’ does not constitute one
2 The Three Narratives on Expert Authority ‘in Action’ during the Pandemic
115

objective homogenous entity or practice, but instead is inherently more piecemeal,
contested, and fluid (Balloux 2022; Farr 2020; Smith, Blastland, and Munafò 2020).
This has been seen in particular in the differing global expert opinions around key
facets of how to tackle the Covid pandemic.
In the earlier stages of the pandemic, one example would be the use of masks
(Gallagher 2020) and the understanding around airborne transmission which was
‘one of the most heated topics within the scientific community’ (Sridhar 2022: 100),
with some highlighting droplet transmission as key (similar to how cold and flu is
often spread) and others indicating airborne transmission was more important to
consider particularly to control the spread of the disease. Scientists such as Profes-
sor Trish Greenhalgh have been critical of WHO and the CDC for being too slow
to acknowledge airborne spread of Covid (Sridhar 2022). She considers how the
dominance of certain scientific disciplines over others (e.g., medical versus chem-
ical) has been behind the reticence to declare this transmission as key to under-
standing the disease and with it, recommending masking as a key form of protec-
tion (Greenhalgh et al. 2021). Consequently, governments often over-emphasised
handwashing over ventilation (Sridhar 2022).
Likewise, herd immunity as a concept to drive government strategy in their
response to the pandemic was also debated within the scientific community.
Herd immunity is based on the principle that by letting the disease spread through
the population (whilst shielding the most vulnerable in society), immunity will
be built up through exposure. A Professor in Global Public Health, Devi Sridhar
(2022: 142) considers herd immunity ‘fringe among mainstream public health
and infectious disease researchers, and called unethical and immoral by the
head of WHO’.
Nevertheless, there were experts putting this view forward such as Anders
Tegnell, chief epidemiologist for the Swedish public health authority and the
‘Great Barrington Consensus’ in the UK. In Sweden, this strategy was pursued
and ultimately considered a failure:
King Carl XVI Gustaf, as well as the Swedish Prime Minister, publicly acknowledged that the
approach taken had failed to protect lives. The King said, ‘I think we have failed. We have a
large number who have died and that is terrible. It is something we all suffer with.’ (Sridhar
2022: 211)
In the UK, the government sought counsel from the Great Barrington Consensus to
help counter the SAGE advisory group advice to engage in a ‘circuit breaker’ lock-
down to stem the spread of Covid in Autumn/Winter 2020 (Calvert and Arbuthnott
2021). Anti-mask and anti-lockdown groups also jumped on this idea to pursue
116
Chapter 5: Covid-19 – A Case Study on Expert Authority

their goals. Consequently, we see the exploitation of scientific debate for ideological
means take place in relation to this specific concept.
Other features of the pandemic also resulted in debate and contestation be-
tween expert groups. For instance, the notion of ‘lockdown fatigue’ suggested by
England Chief Medical Officer, Christ Whitty but refuted by some at SAGE (Sridhar
2022). Equally, the testing of large-scale live events as a means to see if lockdown
measures could be lifted in the Netherlands had their veracity questioned by other
epistemic communities such as behavioural scientists (Sridhar 2022). Similarly, dif-
ferent methodological tendencies in different scientific disciplines (e.g., modelling
versus observation of practice) meant that travel restriction advice by the likes of
WHO was opaque and of limited use (Sridhar 2022). Once vaccines were developed,
doubts were seeded over the AstraZeneca (AZ) version when it emerged blood clots
had featured in some people that received the vaccine (European Medicines Agen-
cy 2021). As the scientific community investigated the source of these clots and de-
bated the advice they should give for who should now receive this vaccine, anti-
vaxxers could use this instance to voice concerns over vaccines in general and gov-
ernments (such as the German and Danish) retreated from the use of AZ despite
the risk being small as Sridhar (2022: 120) outlines:
The chance of a 55-year-old having a vaccine-linked blood clot was estimated to be 4 in a mil-
lion, while being hit by lightning in 2021 was 1 in a million, and dying of coronavirus (which
also causes blood clots) was 800 in a million.
As with masks and herd immunity, these tensions between different expert groups
had real-life consequences for the action (or inaction) of governments, the public
discourse surrounding expertise and the pandemic, and ultimately the success in
managing the spread and death toll of the disease.
For Sridhar (2022: 118), a lot of the debate amongst the scientific community
over aspects such as masks, early lockdowns versus herd immunity, and vaccines
was on account of the precautionary principle not being evoked enough: ‘This al-
lows measures to be implemented in situations where scientific evidence is defi-
cient, but inaction threatens permanent harm.’ Some scientists don’t think it
wise to move ahead based on this principle, others say it might be necessary in
unfolding situations where the science is still learning. The Czech Republic is a
good example of applying the principle as an early adopter of mask policy that
was made mandatory in the country by 18 March 2020:
… the Czech Republic just made a decision that face coverings carry little harm, and possibly
huge benefits, and therefore it made sense to mandate them. This decision would pay off in
letting the country stay open for longer, while containing the spread during its first wave. By

117

April 2020 Spain had recorded 517 deaths per million people, Italy 453, the UK 325, and the
Czech Republic only 21 (Sridhar 2022: 112)
Despite the debate and contestation of expert knowledge (and therefore its author-
ity), there were also indications that a more diverse set of expert disciplines should
have been involved in tackling the pandemic. In the UK, there have been calls for
broader areas of expertise from the likes of social sciences, engineering, logistics,
and cultural studies to name a few to play a role as the pandemic endured (Bing-
ham 2021; Sozudogru 2020). Certainly, reflections from experts in the UK suggest
that a wider range of disciplines beyond epidemiology and modelling should
have been present on the SAGE advisory group from the start and that a greater
number of international experts and a wider diversity of gender and ethnicity
serving on the group would have been beneficial (Costello 2021; Farrar 2021;
Grundmann 2021; Horton 2020; Sridhar 2022).
In this context, debate and contestation between different expert groups is
considered healthy and appropriate to cope with an emerging situation:
The language of unanimity in the SAGE minutes is concerning, in that it reflects a lack of dis-
sent from the consensus that complete suppression was not the right short- or long-term strat-
egy. There seemed little reflection that buying 6–12 months’ time might help science deliver
solutions. This also indicates why diversity and disagreement are healthy and necessary in
scientific advisory groups, especially when there is considerable uncertainty attached to
the topic and no ‘correct’ way forward. (Sridhar 2022: 140).
Whilst the notion that knowledge is evolving and contested might not be novel to
those in expert authority its effect on the perception of expertise by the public
(and by extension, policy and government officials) is a cause for concern for
some (Balloux 2022). For instance, Horton (2020) argues that the differing voices
of a more fragmented expertise base can be used by certain governments as a
plaintive excuse for why they didn’t react quickly enough to the threat posed by
the virus. Preliminary indications also suggested that as the pandemic developed
there was greater risk to trust in experts on account of the changes in scientific
advice (Matthews 2020b). Nevertheless, Horton (2020) and Sridhar (2022) also
argue that self-criticism within science and academic disciplines and beyond
will be needed to continue to manage society even post-Covid, leading to a
wider diversity of expertise being drawn upon in the future. Therefore, in line
with the slightly more positive future envisaged by this decomposition narrative,
there is some room for hope here that a diverse array of expertise will be appre-
ciated as we emerge from the pandemic.
Ultimately, whilst the pandemic constituted a fundamental new global chal-
lenge for expert authority to contend with, each narrative regarding the demise
118
Chapter 5: Covid-19 – A Case Study on Expert Authority

in expert authority can be found to be in operation during this period. De-legitima-
tion of expert authority focused on the behaviour of populist right-wing political
leaders and the use of mis/disinformation to breed at the very least doubt, but
also culture wars and at the more extreme end of the scale, conspiracy theories
regarding the measures experts recommended to contend with the spread of the
disease. Meanwhile, the de-mystification of expert authority could be seen in con-
texts where the rhetoric suggested that expertise was being pursued and underpin-
ned the pandemic response strategy but also where that expertise became envel-
oped into the technocratic neoliberal regime of that same state pursuing that
response strategy. Finally, the decomposition of expert authority is evident in
the various debates and controversies that emerged over how to manage the pan-
demic as the expertise regarding the virus developed in real-time as we all lived
with the emergence and then prevalence of different variants of Covid. Expert au-
thority appeared more contested, heterogenous, fragmented, and fluid but there
was also an emerging appreciation of the need for diversity of expertise to tackle
the many different challenges the pandemic posed. The fact that all three narra-
tives are present in the various experiences of expert authority poses some funda-
mental questions and tensions for the expert and their authority going forward
which the next section of the chapter will analyse.
3 Covid-19: The Return of the Expert?
In establishing the narratives regarding the crisis in expert authority ‘in action’
during the pandemic, what is left for the expert as we begin to emerge from the
challenges it posed for expert authority? In this section, we identify the fundamen-
tal dilemma which experts and their authority faced during the pandemic and
what this begins to indicate for the future. At the heart of the dilemma has
been the degree to which the pandemic resulted in the re-legitimation of expert
authority, or a growing politicisation of expert authority. In the case of re-legitima-
tion, this is assessing whether the pandemic allowed for expert authority to re-
claim some of the legitimacy and status which had been previously lost by provid-
ing the expertise through which the risks of the virus could be effectively
contained. Alternatively, for politicisation, this involves considering whether in
fact expert authority lost even more ground by experts allowing themselves to
be co-opted by political leaders for their ideological and political purposes and
in turn, exposing themselves even more to the populist critique of being merely
’servants of power masquerading as independent and autonomous agents’.

3.1 Re-legitimation
Re-legitimation envisages a revival and renewal of the public service ethic in and
through which traditional forms of expertise are ideologically grounded and or-
ganisationally articulated. Elite expert groups are able to reclaim their occupation-
al identities and organisational roles as guardians of the public interest because
their position and function as public servants protecting us from collective
harm, has been indelibly reinscribed through their vital contribution to navigating
a way through the pandemic. As a result, they can reclaim the social capital and
political legitimacy damaged, if not lost, in recent years as their recurring failure
to live-up to their liberal public service ethic has been restored by their contribu-
tion to managing the pandemic in ways that have saved lives and sustained collec-
tive wellbeing (Collins, Evans, Durant and Weinel 2021).
In some vital respects the pandemic did allow for renewed claims to legitima-
cy for expert authority on this basis as it quickly became clear that science was
going to be a key means by which the world would manage the pandemic
(Tooze 2021; Sridhar 2022). In turn, we witnessed a range of experts across the
globe mobilising quickly from the outbreak of the pandemic onwards to use
their expertise (often voluntarily and pro-bono) and not always within formal gov-
ernment structures and agencies (Farrar 2021) to help mitigate, mediate, and man-
age the pandemic. This was borne out in the various success stories of science: the
creation of PCR¹¹ tests, the creation of LFTs¹², the discovery of treatments to help
Covid sufferers, the development of genome variant sequencing, and of course ul-
timately the development of vaccines.
There were also plenty of instances across the globe where governments did
engage with experts and act on their advice accordingly, re-legitimating expert au-
thority. For instance, Greece gave their expert advisory group not only the power to
advise but also to enact their advice (Sridhar 2022). South Korea, learning from its
experience with MERS¹³ recognised expert advice on testing as key to success and
based its pandemic strategy around this, also attempting to share a lot of its pro-
tocols with other countries. Sub-Saharan Africa, learning from its experiences with
Ebola focused on similar preventative public health informed measures, with cases
such as Senegal showing expertise and not money was the key in the fight against
the pandemic (Sridhar 2022). The obvious final example would be New Zealand,
who listened to public health experts and looked more internationally in terms

120
Chapter 5: Covid-19 – A Case Study on Expert Authority

of the evidence base to draw from, pursuing a successful elimination strategy and
with it boosting public trust in the government (Sridhar 2022).
There were also global organisations that helped to co-ordinate the pandemic
response in significant ways such as WHO, providing ‘technical advice, norma-
tive authority and convening action on the part of its member states’ (Sridhar
2022: 273); CEPI¹⁴, which was influential in vaccine development, centralising test-
ing and enabling comparison of immune response to different vaccines; and
COVAX¹⁵, which focused on the global distribution of vaccines, particularly to coun-
tries with less resources. Whilst each organisation has also been challenged by na-
tional self-interest (e.g., Paiva and Miguel 2022), it has demonstrated the need for
global co-ordination of expertise and logistics to tackle the pandemic and potential
future global grand challenges.
The success of science in manging the pandemic and the success of experts
to be influential in government responses to the pandemic has also resulted in a
rise in public trust for science. For instance, the Wellcome Global Monitor that sur-
veyed more than 119,000 people in 113 countries about their attitudes towards sci-
ence highlighting that: ‘more than three-quarters of people said they trusted sci-
ence (80 per cent) and scientists (77 per cent)’ (Grove 2021: para 2). Research
into news television audiences also suggests that there is in fact a public appetite
to hear more from experts, and a wider range of them, particularly when navigat-
ing a crisis (Morani et al. 2022)
Consequently, there were prospects for expert authority to be re-legitimated
on account of the pandemic. However, this event also thrust experts into the polit-
ical spotlight, and this has left expert authority caught in the cross hairs of the po-
tential for re-legitimation, but also for increased politicisation, particularly as the
pandemic has waxed and waned in is development.
3.2 Politicisation
Politicisation suggests that rather than experts remaining independent of the state,
they become ensnared within the regime, which can in turn damage the basis of
their authority. This can involve either the co-option of experts or even more ex-
treme, the colonisation of experts, to political demands. As Jeremy Farrar observes
this ‘brings me back to the central moral dilemma: does staying in an advisory role

mean being complicit in the outcomes of bad decisions? To be honest, I still don’t
know the answer’ (Farrar 2021: 176).
Here, we return to the particular case study of the UK to begin to examine the
potential the pandemic demonstrated for expert authority to be politicised. This
is on account of the fact that the UK government engaged with experts during
the pandemic, but the terms of this engagement has been nuanced and insidious
where at times it has appeared to pay deference to expert authority and yet at
other times it has played off expert groups against one another and/or co-opted
or even colonised expert representatives to policy/political positions.
3.2.1 Co-optation
‘Co-optation’, Selznick (1949, 1966: 14) tells us, is ‘the process of absorbing new el-
ements into the leadership or policy-determining structure of an organization
as a means of averting threats to it stability or existence’. He conceptually distin-
guishes ‘formal’ from ‘informal’ co-optation: the former, refers to a process that is
publicly visible and bureaucratically identifiable but politically insignificant in
that it doesn’t alter the balance of power within the host organisation; the latter,
to a process which remains privately opaque and bureaucratically obscure but is
politically significant because it fundamentally alters the balance of power within
the host organisation.
In the context of the UK, it might be argued that both forms occurred for key
expert groups, particularly those experts that operate as government advisors. This
notion of co-optation posits that experts have allowed themselves to be absorbed
into a governing regime in which they come to play the pivotal roles in construct-
ing and communicating the scientific gloss which legitimates political decisions on
the grounds of objective and disinterested reasoning – that is, the application of
‘scientific rationality’ – rather than the political logic that has effectively driven
the choices ministers have made in light of them exercising their ‘political ration-
ality’. Key instances in the development of the UK government Covid strategy high-
lighted that the cognitive and organisational boundaries between ‘scientific’ and
‘political’ rationality had become so blurred and porous that medical and scientific
expert advisors seemed to become an integral component of what Selznick (1949/
1966) called an ‘administrative constituency’ and Child (1973) a ‘dominant coalition’
between experts and politicians which jointly manages the crisis.
The Sunday Times investigative journalists Calvert and Arbuthnott’s (2021) ac-
count of the UK government’s ‘Battle with Cornonavirus’, makes it clear that expert
advisors were being used to provide scientific veneer to political decision making.
For instance:
122
Chapter 5: Covid-19 – A Case Study on Expert Authority

It had been Hancock’s [UK Health Secretary] idea to present government decisions to the
public as if they were entirely based on scientific advice, when, in fact, they inevitably in-
volved a huge amount of political calculation. The earnest scientists were taken from their
normal habitat in the corridors of Whitehall and thrust into the limelight as an embodiment
of this scientific approach in order to gain the public’s trust. It was also a way of deflecting
responsibility when tough decisions had to be made’ (Calvert and Arbuthnott 2021: 157–158, em-
phasis added)
Likewise, Calvert and Arbuthnott (2021) provide an extensive account of how Depu-
ty Chief Medical Officer for England Jennifer Harries, was utilised by the govern-
ment to provide scientific gloss for the herd immunity approach initially preferred
by UK ministers. In particular, it focuses on a video that featured Prime Minister
Boris Johnson in conversation with Jennifer Harries shared by Downing Street on
social media on 11 March 2020:
The set-up was Johnson would feed earnest pre-arranged questions and she would give a sci-
entist’s view. Therefore, the government would be seen to be ‘following the science’. It would
start with easy topics such as questions on the well-known symptoms of coronavirus and
build up to the point where she would explain why the UK was following a different path
to the rest of the world with its delay strategy … Johnson then posed what was supposed
to seem like a thoughtful question on a thorny subject. ‘There’s obviously people under a
lot of pressure. Politicians, governments around the world, need to be seen to act’, he said,
with little disguise that he was referring to his own predicament. ‘So, they may do things
that are not necessarily dictated by the science?’ It was a leading question and Harries
knew the script. ‘As a professional, I am absolutely delighted we are following the science’,
she said, – almost as if she was appearing in a shampoo advert as the bespectacled lab tech-
nician in a white coat. She continued: ‘There are other things we can do in this country and
the timing is really important’. Johnson, interjected, eager to reinforce the point: ‘And the tim-
ing is very important, isn’t it?’ Harries was keen to confirm: ‘Critical, absolutely critical. If we
put it in too early, we will just pop up with another epidemic peak, later on’, she said. This was
a further articulation of the government’s intention to allow the virus to spread so that im-
munity could be built-up in the population to prevent a second wave (Calvert and Arbuthnott
2021: 183 emphases added)
In another incident observed by Sridhar (2022: 144) Jenny Harries negates the WHO
advice on testing, masking the political impetus behind the decision:
However, the government was reluctant to acknowledge that testing was constrained because
of capacity. Instead it said this was a strategic decision. Dr Jenny Harries, England’s Deputy
Chief Medical Officer, defended the policy in a press briefing. ‘There comes a point in the pan-
demic when that is not an appropriate intervention’ and argued that WHO’s advice to ‘test,
test, test’ was intended for poor countries, not the UK.
Also, this ‘scientific veneer’ does not appear to have been particularly questioned,
with recent research into TV news coverage of the pandemic highlighting that ex-
3 Covid-19: The Return of the Expert?
123

pert sources weren’t a predominant feature of bulletins but when they were, they
tended to be representatives from SAGE who ‘were not routinely used to scrutinise
the government’s advice’ (Morani et al. 2022: 12).
In addition, co-optation allows for the scapegoating of experts for political
ends, something Farrar (2021) considers occurred with the government treatment
of Public Health England and something seen in now UK Prime Minister, Rishi Su-
nak’s comments that too much power was handed to experts to decide on Covid
measures (BBC 2022). Moreover, some of the reflection on the UK government pan-
demic response so far have also pointed the finger at expert advisors for their cul-
pability and compliance to political authority as well (Walker 2021; Ball 2022). This
is despite the fact that others have also argued that the UK government failure to
respond well to the pandemic was largely on account of ignoring advisors at key
junctures (Reicher 2021).
Consequently, what this demonstrates is that there are very real risks for ex-
perts in allowing themselves to be absorbed into the governing regime in this way.
They are allowed into the ‘inner circle’ decision-making arenas in which key policy
options are formulated and complex operational choices are framed, but their
newly found status as ‘insiders’ risks compromising whatever social capital and le-
gitimacy which has accrued to them as a result of their playing a central part in
‘saving us’ from the worst ravages of the pandemic. Their status as independent
and objective ‘expert advisors’ is now under threat from their much closer and in-
timate association with political decision takers who are driven by the electoral
consequences of the actions they individually and collectively take during the pan-
demic. Whilst potential co-option raises some serious questions as to the status of
the expert, potential colonization may pose an even bigger challenge.
3.2.2 Colonization
Deetz (1992) develops the concept of ‘corporate colonization’ to analyse the un-
obtrusive, but nevertheless pervasive and effective, communication processes
through which the interests and values of powerful economic elites are naturalized
or normalized as ‘taken-for-granted, common sense’ assumptions framing all as-
pects of corporate life. Rather than simply being ‘co-opted’ into a decision-making
process in which opposing views and voices are filtered-out of the decision-taking
agenda in order to protect the vested interests of powerful groups, ‘colonization’
implies a process of total absorption of oppositional groups into a dominant ideol-
ogy in which they completely lose their distinctive identities and rationalities as
actual or potential ‘resistors’. Potentially oppositional groups can then become en-
rolled within a ‘framing narrative’ and in supporting a set of socio-political rela-
tions in which their independence and autonomy becomes so diluted that they
124
Chapter 5: Covid-19 – A Case Study on Expert Authority

lose all claims to a separate and distinctive voice or standing as ‘outsiders’ chal-
lenging the ‘status quo’.
As such, experts may find themselves enrolled, if not colonized, as ‘techno-
crats’ within an emerging political logic of ‘techno populism’ (Bickerton and Accetti
2021). This can be construed as:
… an organizing logic of electoral competition based on the combination of populist and dis-
cursive tropes and modes of political organization [it is] a new structuring logic of contempo-
rary democratic politics [in which] a contextually and historically specific set of incentives
and constraints … affects the way in which rival contenders for public office compete with
one another in the electoral sphere, independently of their substantive policy goals (Bickerton
and Accetti 2021: 17–21).
It claims, in different ways and in a range of socio-historical contexts, to represent
the ‘people as a whole’ and appeals to technical expertise and competence which
can be combined and recombined with one another. It emerges out of the break-
down of the post-Second World War political consensus around managed social de-
mocracy from the late 1970s/early 1980s onwards and can be seen in New Labour
in the UK, the Five Star Movement in Italy, Macron and his political movement in
France and more hybrid examples such as Podemos in Spain.
Bickerton and Accetti (2021) further suggest that the pandemic is likely to re-
inforce this techno populist political logic insofar as it strengthens the ideological
appeal and political authority of ‘technocrats’ by relying increasingly on scientific
modes of reasoning and their associated technologies to protect the health and
welfare of ‘the people’. Consequently, relevant experts are being rapidly incorpo-
rated, even colonized, within the discursive embrace of this political logic to the
extent that they are absorbed within a political-cum-policy narrative which pre-
sumes ‘one best way’ or ‘rational answer’ to keeping the virus under control
and returning society to some sort of ‘normality’ resembling our pre-Covid exis-
tence.
The UK government’s decision to not pursue a ‘circuit breaker’ in September
2020 in order to prevent a further lockdown later that year, starts to indicate
some of the techno-populism Bickerton and Accetti (2021) refer to in action. Calvert
and Arbuthnott (2021) highlight that in mid-September 2020 Boris Johnson is trying
to establish whether to pursue short period circuit breaker of restrictions to stave
off a lengthier and more restricted lockdown in later months as recommended
by SAGE and Independent SAGE. A secret meeting is had between Johnson, and ex-
perts in favour of the herd immunity principle – Professor Sunetra Gupta, Profes-
sor Carl Heneghan, and Anders Tegnell, Sweden’s top epidemiologist. The only
other expert at that meeting was Professor John Edmunds, the UK government’s
3 Covid-19: The Return of the Expert?
125

leading modeller, to articulate the view of his fellow members on SAGE that an im-
mediate two-week circuit breaker lockdown was vital.
Despite this, Johnson opts to call off preparations for the circuit breaker, large-
ly because the herd immunity science is better for his political agenda at the time
in order to appease his chancellor and other more libertarian right-wing elements
of the Conservative party. Nevertheless, ‘The split between No. 10 and its chief
medical and scientific advisers had never been more apparent’ (Calvert and Ar-
buthnott 2021: 360). This decision is a classic incident of policy-led science, but
Chris Whitty, Patrick Vallance, Jennifer Harries, and Jonathan Van Tam still had
to remain the ‘faces’ of this verdict. The innate ideological and political comple-
mentarity or ‘elective affinity’ between populism and technocracy is reinforced
by the pandemic because it forces experts to ‘go along with’ the emerging govern-
mental ‘strategy’ for dealing with the substance and impact of the Covid-19 crisis,
whatever their reservations and worries over its efficacy and effectiveness. Unin-
tendedly, they may be accruing increased public legitimacy and credibility at the
cost of reduced political power and diminished social status within the wider com-
munity.Whitty and Vallance at times were on ‘resignation watch’ by the UK govern-
ment with SAGE scientists concerned they were being used as ‘human shields’ (Cal-
vert and Arbuthnott 2021) for government ministers.
It is for reasons such as these that Davies (2020a: 236) concludes that, ‘in spite
of the brief hiatus, when public expertise and policy competence experienced a
resurgence of enthusiasm from the Johnson government, the longer-term effect
of the pandemic looks likely to be a hastening of the collapse of British liberalism’.
And, as previously suggested, the ethic of ‘public service’ which underpins the
notion of expert seems to have become so fragile that it is in danger of being evis-
cerated by a populist-cum-technocratic political logic that speaks much more vis-
cerally and emotionally to our fears and search for security in profoundly uncer-
tain and unstable times. As Krastev (2020: 39) suggests:
More than any other crises, a public health emergency can induce people voluntarily to accept
restrictions on their liberties in the hope of improving their personal security … [but are
these restrictions] … genuinely favourable to authoritarian concentrations or seizures of
power?
4 A More ‘Public’ Expert
The assessment so far suggests there has been a systemic tension for some experts
between re-legitimation and politicisation as they strive to maintain their distance
and independence whilst simultaneously being prepared to ’put their reputations
126
Chapter 5: Covid-19 – A Case Study on Expert Authority

on the line’ by engaging directly with the roles they were asked to perform by po-
litical elites who remained the final decision makers with the power to accept or
reject their expert advice. The degree to which the re-legitimation, co-option, or
colonization of expert authority becomes fully realised is yet to be seen, but is
there a fourth option that the experience of expert authority during the pandemic
begins to suggest for the future?
Those experts that have been involved with the pandemic in some way suggest
that the answer may lie in expert authority prioritising a more public facing di-
mension where experts are ‘… more open and engaging about what we do, how
the scientific process works, how scientific research and analysis influences policy
making and how its benefits can be shared fairly’ (Farrar 2021: 230).
Nevertheless, engaging more with different publics is by no means easy and
the likes of Sridhar (2022) have also been very honest about the scrutiny, abuse,
and threats she has faced by pursuing this more public facing notion of expert au-
thority. She is but one of many examples she cites of other experts in different
countries across the globe that have also received political pressure and/or public
abuse or even threat to life on account of being a more public facing expert.
This individual experience is in line with Nature’s broader survey into the
abuse of scientific experts indicating that ‘more than two-thirds of researchers re-
ported negative experiences as a result of their media appearances or their social
media comments’ (Nogrady 2021), which can also serve to make these same experts
reticent to engage publicly again. Also, a Guardian survey of UK scientific and med-
ical advisers also indicated the volume of abuse they (and people close to them)
experience (Sample 2021). This suggests that experts can still be de-legitimated
by any means possible, and it won’t just be the individual but science and expertise
more broadly in the firing line as well (Farrar 2021). Consequently, this suggests the
alternate future of a more public facing and transparent expert is also not without
its risks.
5 Conclusion
Overall, this chapter indicates that the three narratives regarding the demise of
expert authority are still very salient in capturing the experience of experts and
expertise even in an emerging global crisis such as the pandemic where expertise
is needed but also has to contend with different government priorities (and ideol-
ogies), a global media system more open to dis/mis information, and a range of
expert groups with their own conventions and norms to begin to tackle this chal-
lenge. Consequently, analysing the pandemic in relation to these narratives reveals
how the arguments contained within them are still pertinent today and could go

127

some way in explaining how the world didn’t respond to the crisis as well as it
could, and certainly how there was a variance of response across different coun-
tries.
In assessing what this means for experts and expert authority there appears to
be a potential triple edged sword to the pandemic for experts where it serves as:
(a) A chance to reassert traditional expert authority as societies realised they
were going to need experts to navigate out of this crisis
(b) The potential for co-option or colonisation of experts by policy and the state
(c) A phenomenon that has highlighted the contingent nature of knowledge and
expertise
Initially, the pandemic seemed to offer expert groups of professionals, consultants,
technicians, and administrators a ‘golden opportunity’ to regain their position and
status as trustworthy specialist advisors, if not legislators, as their knowledge and
technologies become even more critical to managing the risk of the virus. As polit-
ical elites seemed to become ever more dependent on the analysis and assessments
which their professional, technical, and managerial/administrative elites provide,
so their public standing and social status revived in ways that substantially pushed
back against the accusations of ‘remote elitism’ and ‘duplicitous objectivism’.
However, the enhanced political and social capital accruing to experts as a re-
sult of their, seemingly, vital contributions to re-establishing the public health
environment to a semblance of ‘normal’, has to be balanced against the dangers
which this new, highly visible and vital, role in restoring safety and public order
presents. Experts may now be standing, if it hadn’t been for social distancing,
‘shoulder to shoulder’ with government ministers and political leaders in ways
they haven’t been of late, and this offers very real opportunities to re-establish
their credentials and status as ‘public servants’ acting on behalf of society’s collec-
tive values and interests. However, there is always the lurking threat that these
same experts will find themselves being, once again, regarded with suspicion, if
not distrust, by the public at large as they become seen for what ‘they really
are’ – that is, technocrats totally incorporated within governing regimes which
will do whatever they have to do to retain, or gain, political power.
Likewise, Covid-19 has demonstrated that ‘even populists need experts’ (Bick-
erton and Accetti 2021: 212), but experts need to be very careful as to what they let
themselves – and ‘us’ – in for particularly when they allow themselves to be drawn
into some sort of ‘Faustian pact’ with populist governments. At the very least, ex-
perts may find themselves enrolled into a governance regime in which they be-
come an integral, and vital, part of the ‘dominant coalition’ (Child 1973) which
determines government policy during the pandemic, but at the potential cost of ab-
sorbing that regime’s priorities and values without necessarily knowing it.
128
Chapter 5: Covid-19 – A Case Study on Expert Authority

Therefore, the pandemic perhaps doesn’t suggest a return of the expert as con-
ceived in the traditional ideal type or in Giddens’ (1994) notion of institutionalised
trust. Instead, the boundaries between science and medicine on the one hand and
politics on the other are becoming more difficult to police. Where this leaves the
expert (and the professional groups that underpin them) is where research now
needs to turn. There are signs of hope in the recognition of the diversity of exper-
tise needed to tackle global challenges such as the pandemic and in experts recog-
nising their authority may come from a greater engagement with a variety of
stakeholders, including the public. These final points are the launchpad for the
next chapter where we begin to formulate how expert authority can be re-concep-
tualised to suggest a more ‘reflexive’ form going forward.

Chapter 6: Reflexive Expert Authority and
Governance
1 Introduction
Over the course of the analysis developed so far in this book, several major, inter-
related themes have been identified which we focus on in this chapter relating to
the emergence of a distinctively ‘reflexive’ form of expert authority and gover-
nance which departs in several crucial respects from the established model out-
lined in chapter one.
First, the need for a more realistic conception of science and scientific ration-
ality which differs from the ‘crown jewels’ or ‘immaculate conception’ of the latter
that more conventional models of expert authority and governance have tradition-
ally relied on to justify their claims about its unique epistemological foundations
and form.
Second, a reappraisal of the distinctive structural and processual features of
expert knowledge and skill which are analytically and substantively grounded in
a proper appreciation of the inherently contested, provisional, and contextually de-
pendent nature of the understandings and interventions that experts provide.
Third, a more rounded understanding of the scale, scope and severity of the
risks which experts are now called upon to deal within an environment where
multiple threats and challenges simultaneously present themselves to ‘them’ and
‘us’ in ways that may undermine previously accumulated knowledge and practice.
Fourth, a better developed analysis of the ‘trust and control dynamics’ which
indelibly shape and reshape all forms of expert knowledge and skill in a world
where the balance between them seems to have shifted decisively in favour of
the latter and to the detriment of the former.
Finally, and by building on the improved understanding made possible by the
previous analysis, to appreciate the key role that reflexive thought and action plays
in legitimating expert authority and the modes of governance through which it is
most likely to be articulated and implemented.
However, before dealing with the above themes we focus on the political phi-
losophy roots of reflexive authority in theories of ‘associative’ and ‘deliberative’ de-
mocracy and the endemic tensions which this dual intellectual inheritance be-
queathed.

2 Democratic Theory and Reflexive Expert Authority
Associative democratic theory has its intellectual roots in a communitarian/collec-
tivist tradition of political thinking and practice (Nisbet 1969; MacIntyre 1981, 1988;
Etzioni 1988, 1993; Horton and Mendus 1994; Hirst 1994; Wolin 2004; Collier 2018),
while deliberative democratic theory is grounded in a rationalist/individualist tra-
dition in which democratic decision making is seen to rest on ‘agreement through
argument’ (Elster 1998; Cohen and Arato 1992; Forrrester 2019; O’Flynn 2022). Yet,
both traditions also share an overlapping political philosophy and practice de-
manding the (re)empowering of civil society in which voluntary associations, social
movements, and local organizations hold big business and government to account
by scrutinizing and challenging the epistemological-cum-ethical grounds on which
their decisions are made and the quality of the substantive outcomes they gener-
ate. This is the new socio-political context in which ‘reflexive expert authority and
governance’ emerges as a response to the much heightened anxieties and uncer-
tainties of a risk environment in which multiple ecological, biological, and political
crises now confront us and in which our dependence on and suspicions about ‘ex-
perts’ are greater than ever. As Freedland (2022: para 11) reflects, ‘if the public de-
cides it can no longer trust those in authority, then when the chief medical officer
stands up to warn of a new threat to public health, there is no guarantee that any-
body will listen’.
Hirst (1994: 19) defines ‘associative democracy’ as a political philosophy prem-
ised on the claim ‘that individual liberty and human welfare are both best served
when as many of the affairs of society as possible are managed by voluntary and
democratically self-governing associations.’ This claim legitimates a theory of polit-
ical practice in which voluntary self-governing associations become the primary
mode of institutional and organizational governance in which power is redistrib-
uted as far as possible to lower levels of political decision-making. In turn, this ne-
cessitates ‘that the state should cede functions to such associations and create the
mechanisms of public finance whereby they can undertake them [thus reducing]
the scale and scope of the affairs of society that are administered by state agencies
overseen by representative institutions’ (Hirst 1994: 21).
Moves in this direction would create a very different political and governance
context to which most expert occupational groups and organizations are used to
and would radically shift the balance of power and control away from them and to-
wards the newly empowered ‘citizen consumer’ (Clarke at al. 2007). As we have
seen repeatedly throughout this book, the increasing power and authority of ex-
pert groups and organizations in general and of elite professions such as medicine
and law has depended on political elites embedded in state administrative struc-
tures being prepared to support, if not sponsor, their ‘upward mobility projects’
2 Democratic Theory and Reflexive Expert Authority
131

over extended periods of time. Centralization of state power has gone together
with successful ‘professionalization projects’ which have protected and enhanced
the twin-track ‘epistemological exclusion’ and ‘jurisdictional closure’ strategies ex-
pert groups have pursued in order to legitimate and stabilize their claims to ‘au-
thorized control’ over particular occupational territories and organizational do-
mains. Although there has always been tension and conflict between state elites
and expert groups and associations – and particularly as we have repeatedly
seen under neoliberal state elites – over how much self-governance and manage-
ment the former should allow the latter to enjoy, centralized power and expert au-
tonomy have been able to come to terms with each other under the unwritten/in-
formal social contract between states, experts, and publics previously discussed in
this book.
Insofar as a move from ‘representative’ to ‘associative’ democracy would nec-
essarily entail some significant deconstruction of and reduction in centralized
state power in favour of ‘civil society’ associations and movements such as region-
al and local governments, voluntary organizations and other non-state agencies,
then this would radically change, if not transform, the institutional landscape in
which expert occupational groups operate. It would require a fundamental rene-
gotiation of the terms on which the implicit social contract between states, experts
and publics have been previously agreed in order to ensure a marked shift in the
balance of power and control towards ‘civil society associations’ in which citizens
and consumers were empowered as a precondition for them ceding greater collec-
tive and individual trust to the experts supporting them. This would also require
much great openness and ‘connectiveness’ (Noordegraaf 2020) of expert occupa-
tional groups to the values, needs and priorities of the wider communities in
which they become more socially and organizationally embedded as a result of
this overarching shift towards associative democracy. This would only be possible
if expert occupations and the organizations regulating and protecting them be-
come much less defensive, secretive and self-regarding in their corporate cultures
and practices.
Although not quite as radical in their scope and strategy, theories of ‘deliber-
ative democracy’ also have wide-ranging implications for how expert occupational
groups and organizations are regarded and regulated. Elster (1998: 8, emphasis in
original) defines ‘deliberative democracy’ as involving ‘collective decision making
with the participation of all who will be affected by the decision or their represen-
tatives [and including] decision making by means of arguments offered by and to
participants who are committed to the values of rationality and impartiality’.
While this raises the organizational and epistemological preconditions required
for deliberative democracy to a relatively high level, it has the advantage of em-
phasizing the need for a focus on outcomes as well as processes to the extent
132
Chapter 6: Reflexive Expert Authority and Governance

that it depends upon a close analogy being drawn between political and scientific
argumentation in which decision-making proceeds through and is legitimated by
deliberation. Again, this may be held up as an ideal set of conceptual preconditions
which real functioning democracies may only approximate to in varying degrees,
but it has the advantage of analytically specifying the theoretical model against
which various forms of criticism may be evaluated (O’Flynn 2022). It provides a
set of criteria for assessing the legitimacy of decision-making in which ‘public argu-
ment and reasoning among equal citizens’ (O’Flynn 2022: 17) lies at its conceptual
core, as well as highlighting the vital role that ‘institutional support’ plays in nur-
turing and protecting ‘deliberative procedures as the source of legitimacy’ (O’Flynn
2022: 18) and hence ‘authority’. Legitimacy and authority of collective decisions or
choices arises out of ‘free and reasoned deliberations’ between participants who
are not constrained by pre-existing power relations and the ideological preferen-
ces and normative conventions which they embody. Thus, ‘ideal deliberation aims
to arrive at a rationally motivated consensus’ (O’Flynn 2022: 20), but there is no
guarantee that this consensus will be forthcoming or that it will last forever. In-
deed, the expectation built into the theoretical model of deliberative democracy
is that consensus will be time bound and open to reappraisal and renegotiation
when enough participants subject to it demand that it should be revisited.
As with ‘associative democracy’, the theory of ‘deliberative democracy’ has
major analytical and practical implications for expert authority and governance
(Holst and Molander 2017). It refocuses attention on the accountability and scruti-
ny mechanisms through which the legitimacy of the latter can be reviewed and
revitalized within deliberative arenas and processes such as ‘citizens’ juries’ in
Scotland (Roberts et al. 2020) or other ‘mini-publics’ like ‘citizens’ assemblies’ in
Ireland (O’Flynn 2022) in which critical legal and public policy issues are debated
and resolved. In these fora, the role of the expert is potentially transformed from
one of exclusively possessing superior knowledge and exercising jurisdictional con-
trol into one of leading the discursive processes and shaping the technical inter-
ventions through which consensus-based decision-making over complex disputes
and problems can emerge and be ratified.
Theories of associative and deliberative democracy have been roundly criti-
cized for their lack of attention to the material and structural inequalities that in-
delibly shape political decision-making in real world democracies and the ways in
which the institutional innovations and experiments they recommend are open to
cultural and political manipulation in a social media saturated world (O’Flynn
2022). While theories of associative democracy are more cognisant of corporate
power and the role which it plays in framing the structural context in which de-
liberative processes occur and theories of deliberative democracy are more sensi-
tive to the importance of individual reasoning in shaping the latter, the analytical
2 Democratic Theory and Reflexive Expert Authority

tension between them provides a useful ‘jumping off point’ for understanding the
growing significance of reflexive forms of expert authority. This underlying tension
between ‘structure’ and ‘agency’ opens up possibilities for analysing the processes
through which expert authority is ‘legitimated through contestation’ in ways that
are consistent with a more reflexive model of the latter as it has emerged from
‘science and technology studies’ in which deliberatively generated collective epis-
temological consensus plays a not dissimilar role.
3 Science and Scientific Rationality
Since the 1970s ‘science and technology studies’ (STS) have focused on what scien-
tists do in their everyday work in the lab, or field, or station, rather than what they
‘ought to be doing’ according to some idealized, ‘revelatory’ or ‘crown jewels’
model of scientific perfection (Collins et al. 2020: 76). Focusing on ‘the detailed ob-
servation of scientific practice – treating it as day-to-day work rather than a set of
hidden, priestly rituals – resulted in some debunking of the mystery of science’
(Collins et al. 2020: 49–50). This ‘debunking process’ has given rise to a more social-
ly realistic model of what science is and how it works, while raising difficult and
complex questions about how extensively epistemological consensus building in
science should go beyond the scientific community itself to include a potentially
infinite range of non-expert stakeholder groups.
Interpreting the significance of this body of STS research very cautiously and
carefully, Collins et al. (2020: 57) suggest it paves the way for a ‘rough diamonds’
model of scientific knowledge and practice in which ‘scientific judgements are
intricately related to social judgements about the priorities, preferences and behav-
iour of patients or users.’ It also lends support to a conception of the ‘scientist’ or
‘scientific expert’ as an ‘honest craftsperson doing their best, informed by noble
values, but inevitably fallible’ (Collins et al. 2020: 76). They also maintain that
this reconceptualization of science and scientists as organizationally and occupa-
tionally grounded in ‘painstaking craftwork in the context of a complex reality’
(Collins 2020: 77), rather than as high priests engaged in ‘revelatory epistemology’,
does not detract from or undermine scientific expertise or the scientific profes-
sions’ claims to authority. Instead, both the profession and the legitimation of
their expertise are now based upon the conception of science as ‘systematic inqui-
ry’ working towards better understandings of and solutions to complex problems
by expert crafts persons who try to adhere to core values around integrity, disin-
terestedness and evidence. They also note that the increasing ideological and polit-
ical influence exerted by free market capitalism and authoritarian populism has
put this craft-based, ‘rough diamond’ model of science and scientific practice
134
Chapter 6: Reflexive Expert Authority and Governance

under extreme pressure in recent years. This is the case in that they both recognize
only the legitimacy of those forms of expertise which are willing to subject them-
selves to external domination and control in the service of profit maximization or
‘the peoples’ will’.
Oreskes (2019) fleshes out the implications of this rough diamond/craft-based
model of science and scientific expertise for the way we might look at ‘scientific
rationality in practice’. She argues that the latter emerges from the ‘transforma-
tive interrogation’ processes embedded within ‘agnostic fields’ of specialization
through which ‘novel solutions to problems are developed, accepted, and sustained
as facts’ (Oreskes 2019: 247–248, emphasis in original). Epistemological contestation
within and between communities of expert groups and organizations operating
across a wide range of scientific fields – that is, disputes and disagreements as
to what is to count as ‘true’ or ‘valid’ knowledge – and the communities and insti-
tutions which they serve, is now regarded as a strength rather than a weakness of
scientific practice. Scientific rationality emerges from these disputes and disagree-
ments in the form of ‘sedimented epistemological consensus’ over well-founded
judgements accumulating over long periods of trial and error and the ongoing in-
terrogations and scrutiny of the results that it has produced. Rational assessment
of competing epistemological claims is now seen to be grounded in the accumulat-
ed, codified experiences and understandings of scientific craft persons doing their
best to adjudicated between them, rather than being determined by the mechan-
ical application of algorithms, metrics or laws.
For Oreskes (2019: 248), it is those knowledge claims that have survived sus-
tained interrogation and critical scrutiny by those ‘craft experts’ who are deeply
involved their production and evaluation which deserve to be regarded as valid
in the sense of being well-founded and based on the ‘dynamic consensus’ at the
epistemological core of scientific investigation and development. Science simulta-
neously generates continuity and novelty in the form of competing claims made by
those knowledgeable and skilled in the crafting of scientific investigations and
appraising the quality of the knowledge which they produce. Articulating the irre-
deemably ‘social’ character of science and the scientific expertise through which it
is made possible is not an admittance of weakness but an expression of the under-
lying robustness and strength of the knowledge it reproduces. Indeed, science and
scientific expertise can no longer rely on ‘reactive’ or ‘passive’ trust as a basis for
legitimating its authority and status. They must both actively and proactively en-
gage in processes and practices of ‘trust building’ within the communities in
which they are embedded, confident in the view that it will provide the social
and cultural foundations for justifying collective decision making in risk environ-
ments where rising levels of uncertainty and anxiety are the ‘new normal’
(Oreskes and Conway 2010).

135

4 Expert Experience and Civic Epistemology
This more socially realistic model of science and the practice-based understanding
of scientific expertise which it promotes is also reflected in more recent work on
‘experience-based expertise’ and the critical role that it plays in the formation, le-
gitimation and regulation of professional knowledge and skill (Collins and Evans
2009; Collins 2013; Young and Muller 2014). If STS research and scholarship has en-
couraged a measured reappraisal of ‘crown jewels’ science through the develop-
ment of a more socially grounded and politically sensitive appreciation of how sci-
ence works in practice and what this means for justifying scientific expertise in a
wider socio-cultural context, then experienced-based approaches to expertise have
simultaneously reinforced our understanding of a ‘citizens or civic epistemology’
and the role of professionals in generating and curating the latter (Collins et al.
2020).
In a series of landmark publications, Collins and his co-authors (Collins and
Evans 2007; Collins 2013; Collins 2019; Collins et al. 2020) have develop a general
analytical framework for understanding different forms of expertise within a:
wider transformation in the way expertise has been understood [in] a move away from see-
ing knowledge and ability as quasi logical or mathematical and toward a more wisdom-based
or competence-based model … expertise is now seen more and more as something practical –
something based in what you can do rather than what you can calculate or learn (Collins and
Evans 2009: 23 emphasis in original).
Specialist knowledge is now seen as being practice dependent, and requiring,
above all else, ‘mastering a tacit knowledge-laden specialism to a high level of ex-
pertise’ (Collins and Evans 2009: 23).
Conceptually relocated within this ‘practice turn’ to the study and understand-
ing of expertise, ‘contributory expertise’ is of greatest relevance to the analysis we
have developed in this book because it redirects our analytical attention to the
fact that it ‘enables those who have acquired it to contribute to the domain to
which the expertise pertains; contributory experts have the ability to do things
within the domain of expertise’ (Collins and Evans 2009: 24). A five-stage model
of ‘contributory expertise’ is subsequently developed, entailing a move through
from ‘stage 1 the novice’ through to ‘stage 5 the expert’, as consisting of the unself-
conscious recognition of ‘complete contexts’ in which high level performance of
domain specific expertise relies, primarily, on tacit knowledge and understanding
that often doesn’t correspond, or even contradicts, rules acquired at the novitiate
stage. It also highlights the critical importance of ‘interactional expertise’ to the
successful performance of ‘contributory expertise’ as entailed in mastering do-
136
Chapter 6: Reflexive Expert Authority and Governance

main specific language and enculturation within a linguistic community’s values
and practices.
Without high level ‘interactional expertise’, contributory experts are ill-equip-
ped and unable to bridge the gaps and fissures that often open-up and fester be-
tween expert groups and the communities which they serve. In addition, they
need high level reflective ability and skill because of its critical role in building in-
teractional expertise on the part of contributory experts who, if they are to be suc-
cessful in gaining the attention and sympathy of the wider communities in which
they are embedded, must cross ‘social boundaries and [spend] a long time in alien
social environments to which there is restricted access’ (Collins and Evans 2009:
37). Only in this, relatively open, implicit, interactional and reflexive way can ex-
pert groups effectively exercise their domain-specific ‘contributory expertise’ in
ways that build and enable our citizens to develop a more inclusive and participa-
tory ‘civic epistemology’ that can counteract the severe damage which authoritar-
ian populism would inflict on pluralist democracy (Collins et al. 2020: 84). This
consensus building and pluralistically based ‘civic epistemology’ recognises that
science, or for that matter any other ‘contributory expertise’ such as medicine, ar-
chitecture, engineering, or sociology, can never be ‘pure’ in the sense of completely
disengaging from society and the social relations and practices through which they
are all made possible as sustainable institutional ensembles. Yet, it does insist that
‘expertise must be given its due’ by recognizing that the authority on which ex-
perts depend for their position and trust within the communities in which they
operate presumes they will do their level best to build epistemological consensus
through ‘organized scepticism’ – that is, through constructing, critiquing and curat-
ing the best available shared specialist knowledge and skills pertaining to society’s
problems and crises, whether poverty or pandemics – and that they will do this by
consistently engaging with the communities in which the latter occur.
This ‘experience or practice turn’ in STS is also reflected in the ‘sociology of
professional expertise’ in which reflexivity on the part of professional practition-
ers as they go about their daily business assumes rather more analytical impor-
tance and explanatory relevance than the institutionalized and formalized regula-
tory processes given so much prominence in orthodox, mainstream research
focused on licensing, accreditation and closure (Young and Muller 2014; Burns
2019; Gorman and Vallas 2020; Saks 2021). Drawing on the concept of Schön’s
(1990) ‘epistemology of practice’ and Bernstein’s (2000) concept of ‘regional knowl-
edges’, Young and Muller (2014: 13) develop a conceptualization of professional
knowledge that:
is both “theoretical” (that is, general and unvarying) and “practical” (that is, purposive and
contextual). Contemporary professions are about doing things but doing complex things
4 Expert Experience and Civic Epistemology
137

that cannot rely on experience alone, like crafts could for their expertise … professional
knowledge is always sectoral, not general, like the traditional disciplines; it relates to specific
occupational sectors such as health, transport and education.
Within this practice-based conceptual framework, the concept of ‘a professional or
expert practitioner’ cannot be reduced to merely functional technical expertise but
must embrace the tacit, reflexive judgements which they are called upon to make
as they confront the inevitable ethical, moral and political dilemmas the latter en-
tails (Grace 2014).
By refocusing analytical attention on the centrality of the reflexive – that is, the
‘creative/interpretive’ rather than ‘rational/technical’ (Saks 2021) – aspects of pro-
fessional expertise, the ‘experience/practice based’ approach to the study of profes-
sional work also reminds us of the critical importance of the wider socio-political
context in which professionals operate as it shapes and reshapes the challenges
they face (Leicht 2016; Reed 2018; Burns 2019; Saks 2021). Once we begin to see
the full analytical significance of what Collins and Evans (2009) conceptualize as
the ‘contributory expertise’ lying at the core of professional-cum-expert work, as
it is communicated and justified through their interpretive discursive practices,
shifting role identities and dynamic knowledge regimes (Burns 2019: 209–216),
then we begin to appreciate how ‘contextual challenges’ and ‘reflexive practices’
are becoming intimately interconnected in a world where traditional defences
of epistemological exclusivity and jurisdictional closure no longer guarantee the
legitimacy and protection they once delivered.
Leicht (2016) and Saks (2021) suggest that in this ‘brave new expert world’ –
where the institutionalized defences which established professionals once relied
on to legitimate and protect them are no longer, structurally or ideologically, robust
enough to guarantee or underwrite their authority and status – professionals will
need to redefine their roles, practices and identities. If, for example, the ‘sophisti-
cated certificate ecosystem’ on which Kirkpatrick et al. (2021) place so much reli-
ance in defending the regulatory regimes through which professional ‘labour mar-
ket shelters’ (Freidson 2001) and ‘jurisdictional work domains’ (Abbott 1988) are
protected and policed are no longer able to offer the degree of ‘expert insulation’
they once did due to their inherent lack of administrative discrimination (‘every-
body has one’) and declining political impact (‘nobody really cares’), then this
would imply the need for a radical reworking of the working practices and discur-
sive regimes through which all forms of professional/expert authority is reflexively
communicated and legitimated. Indeed, this will be even more the case for expert
groups who never enjoyed the degree of institutionalized protection afforded to es-
tablished professionals and who are even more reliant on ‘active’, rather than ‘pas-
138
Chapter 6: Reflexive Expert Authority and Governance

sive’, trust building to garner whatever social recognition and political support
they can for legitimating their knowledge claims and the authority flowing from it.
Thus, the turn from a largely ‘technical/rational’ conception of professional/
expert knowledge and practice towards a much deeper recognition of their ‘reflex-
ive/interpretive’ dimensions, as well as of the critical role the latter will play in re-
adjusting and realigning contemporary professionals to a very different socio-po-
litical and economic-technical context, allows us to see the emergent nature of
contemporary professionalism in a new analytical light. Between them, Leicht
(2016), Burns (2019) and Saks (2021), collectively suggest that the highly specialized
and esoteric ‘theoretical-cum-technocratic’ discursive regime which has dominated
our conventional understanding of professional/expert authority is giving way to a
much more inclusive ‘practical-cum-mediative’ discourse in which ‘managing risk’,
‘knowledge integrity’ and ‘innovative change’ become the new communicative sig-
nifiers. Burns (2019) summarizes this discursive-cum-practice shift in our under-
standing of professional/expert authority as entailing an ‘unbundling’ of ‘professio-
nal’ and ‘expertise’ such that the latter is cut from its umbilical institutional cord
to ‘professionalism’ and indiscriminately reproduces across a wide range of pre-ex-
isting occupational domains and organizational boundaries. No wonder Kirkpa-
trick’s et al. (2021) ‘certificate ecosystem’ remains so fecund, even if it does so at
the cultural and political cost of severely diluting, if not denuding, its claims to
‘sophistication’ as it lends its formal legitimacy to anybody prepared to pay the cer-
tification fee required. The larger the number of occupational groups the ‘certifi-
cation ecosystem’ recognizes, the less potent it becomes as a regulatory mechanism
offering meaningful administrative differentiation between distinctive levels of oc-
cupational expertise and the political legitimation this confers on those ranked
more highly within the expert hierarchy it reproduces.
We will return to the longer-term implications of the increasing political and
cultural influence of ‘reflexive expert authority’ in the next chapter of this book.
For now, we turn to its significance for our understanding of the critical role
which ‘contributory expertise’ plays in contemporary risk management.
5 Reflexivity and Risk
As Hoogenboom and Ossewaarde (2005: 612) suggest, Beck, Giddens and Lash’s
(1994) original conceptualization of ‘reflexive modernization’ is grounded in the ar-
gument that ‘late modern society is a society in a continuous legitimation crisis.’
Because they can no longer lay claim to universal, rational, and objective knowl-
edge as a basis for legitimating decision-making in government, business, public
services and civic organizations, late modern societies have become much more
5 Reflexivity and Risk
139

dependent on the temporary, negotiated agreements arising out of political and
economic struggles between major institutional actors as a basis for ‘moving for-
ward’ in relation to longer term policy formulation and implementation. Thus,
the ‘epistemological consensus’ taken-for-granted under rationalist modes of deci-
sion-making typical of earlier phases of modernization can no longer be relied
upon because it has been seriously eroded and compromised by an increasingly
disputatious, fissured and relativistic polity and culture. Rational authority has
to give way to some other form of legitimation and authorization which is more
‘in tune with the times’ and recognizes the need for much more pluralistic, inclu-
sive and reflective modes of collective decision-making under conditions of multi-
plying risks and uncertainties, and the deep-seated generalized sense of anxiety
they produce.
Under reflexive modernization, ‘for the reflexive organization the point is how
to integrate members in the context of extreme uncertainty’ (Hoogenboom and
Ossenwarde 2005: 616), while also having to depend upon more informal, ad hoc
and renegotiable integrative mechanisms lacking the stability and continuity asso-
ciated with formal bureaucracy based on rational-legal authority. Within these re-
flexive organizational forms, experts play a very different role to that specified
under rational bureaucratic organization. They must build and sustain ‘active
trust’ because they can no longer rely on ‘reactive or passive trust’ to legitimate
their authoritative role in complex collective decision-making contexts in which
competing expert knowledges vie for attention and reinforce the uncertainties
and anxieties embedded within the latter. ‘Active trust’ must be sought by ‘opening
out’ institutions to a much broader and more inclusive range of ‘voices’ and ‘val-
ues’ in situations where ‘we have no choice but to make choices, filtering these
through the active reception of shifting forms of expert knowledge; in such circum-
stances, new forms of organizational solidarity replace the old’ (Beck, Giddens,
Lash 1994: 187). In this way, ‘institutional reflexivity’ becomes a self-reinforcing
process whereby expert knowledge disputes proliferate, dividing rather than unit-
ing and integrating organizational members, under decision-making situations al-
ready characterized by extreme uncertainties in relation to the risks that commun-
ities face and the most appropriate ways of coping with them. As they become
more reflexive – that is, open to and dependent on the very expert knowledges
which they generate and reproduce in their search for ‘active trust’ and ‘contested
integration’ – institutions and organizations become permeated by circulating
‘modes of knowing and doing’ which cannot be formalized and codified as they
were under legal rational bureaucracy. Older forms of organizational solidarity
– such as hierarchy, function, occupation and rules – remain in place but they be-
come more fragile as decision-making is ‘opened out’ to a much wider range of in-
terests, movements and technologies which, directly and indirectly, challenge the
140
Chapter 6: Reflexive Expert Authority and Governance

formal authority which experts have accumulated through their monopoly control
over specialized knowledge and the claims to expertise it passively justified.
This conceptualization of institutional/organizational reflexivity and the
modes of governance and administration which it authorizes is logically and em-
pirically tied to an analysis of the changing forms of ‘risk’ emerging under late
modernity and the escalating scale and scope of the threats and challenges they
pose to communities in the 21st century. Both within the sociology of organiza-
tions/professions and the sociology of science/technology, an overlapping body of
knowledge has emerged that moves us away from a somewhat narrowly focused
rationalistic/engineering approach to ‘risk’ towards a discursive/political approach
in which institutional and organizational reflexivity play a central role (Turner
1976, 1978; Perrow 1984; Vaughan 1996; Beck 1992, 1997, 1999).
Within the sociology of organizations/professions research literature, there
has been increasing emphasis on the political and cultural processes through
which ‘risks’ are normalized as ‘natural’, or at least ‘acceptable if regrettable’ rou-
tine features of organizational life in highly competitive economic environments.
Dominant corporate cultures and expert systems ensure that achieving targets,
deadlines and profitability override any concern with the threats that risk-taking
poses to human safety and well-being. As Vaughan’s (1996: 387–422) case study
of the Challenger disaster concludes ‘contextual rationality’ – that is, the rational-
ity embedded in recurring organizational/expert routines and the corporate hier-
archies and cultures justifying them – played a critical role in ‘normalizing devi-
ance’ from established safety rules and permitting, indeed encouraging, unsafe,
high-risk behaviour to occur on a regular basis.
In a complementary manner, recent developments in the sociology of science/
technology highlights both the threats and opportunities presented by ‘risks [as]
man-made hybrids’(sic) (Beck 1999: 146 emphases in original) which combine nat-
ural and human processes in complex, unintended ways that do not lend them-
selves to easy scientific prediction or technical control. As ‘man-made hybrids’,
contemporary risks require much higher levels of institutional and organizational
reflexivity in order to encourage and support experts to think and act in respon-
sible ways and not to be dominated by political and economic elites who control
the ‘risk assessment bureaucracies’ (Beck 1999: 150). For Beck (1999: 143), ‘risks
are at the same time “real” and constituted by social perception and construction’.
They have real world impacts on our lives and the ways in which we live them
but our knowledge about them and their actual and potential influence is mediat-
ed by a complex configuration of historical, cultural and political factors which
must be openly debated and sensitively calibrated as we ‘go along’ dealing with
them as best we can.
5 Reflexivity and Risk
141

If ‘reflexive experts’ are to be effective managers of hybrid risks in which
natural phenomena and human processes are so intimately intertwined, then
they will need the cultural sensitivities and political skills required to understand
and communicate the complexities and challenges which these configurations of
threats and opportunities present to ‘us’ as communities of pluralistically diverse
and often conflicting values and interests. The ‘bureaucratic-cum-technocratic’ vi-
sion of expertise and the authority it conveys can no longer equip ‘them’ or ‘us’ to
deal with the multiple hazards that now confront us in an era when the conven-
tional divisions between ‘nature’ and ‘society’ are breaking down under the esca-
lating pressures generated by ecological deterioration, social dislocation and polit-
ical polarization.
What Beck (1999: 91–108) conceptualizes as ‘sub politics’ – that is, sub-state/
national level politics which can encompass a range of institutional levels and or-
ganizational forms from regional/local governments to civic associations and vol-
untary organizations – cannot presume that the formal, rational legal authority
represented by state-sanctioned experts and professionals will be able to sort
out the disputes and conflicts crystalizing around the identification, calibration
and containment of ‘risks’ in highly uncertain environments. Simply waiting for
government sponsored and legitimated ‘expert research, and more expert re-
search’ to solve the problem of effective risk management for you won’t work
under conditions where the complex combination of ecological and technological
hazards means ‘trust becomes central; a trust capital that can be wasted by con-
tinuing to act out the old industrial scenario’ (Beck 1999: 101). Instead, effective
risk management under these conditions demands a new form of ‘sub politics’
in which innovative intraorganizational and interorganizational modes of expert
action are legitimated through ‘much better-informed publics and socially aware
firms, all brought face to face with the consequences of their actions from
which they are at present largely divorced … we have to find ways to deal demo-
cratically with the ambivalences of modern life and decide democratically which
risks we want to take’ (Beck 1999: 108).
Under ‘sub politics’, the role of the expert becomes one of facilitating this ‘face-
to-face’ confrontation with the consequences, both intended and unintended, of
our individual and collective actions through the reflexive monitoring and commu-
nicating of the complex realities which living in world where large-scale hazards,
risks and manufactured uncertainties unavoidably entails. The latter are ‘no longer
the preserve of scientists and experts, the nature of hazards is demonstrated ev-
erywhere and for everyone willing and interested to see’ (Beck 1999: 151). This
means that the scientists and experts’ primary responsibility is to accrue and dis-
seminate the more collaborative and coproduced forms of expertise through which
this ‘seeing’ can be achieved. Their authority is legitimated through their willing-
142

ness and success in engaging in this process of reflexively ‘opening-up’ their speci-
alized knowledge and understanding in ways which better equip the communities
of which they are an integral part to see the complex realities they face and to find
ways of dealing with them more honestly and collectively.
We have clearly come a long way, analytically and normatively, from the con-
ventional, neo-Weberian model of expert authority legitimated through monopoly
control over specialized knowledge and the workplace occupational closures it
makes possible. Under ‘reflexive expert authority’, the ‘trust and control dynamics’
shift ineluctably towards a much more open, participatory and negotiated gover-
nance system in which experts willingly admit a far broader range of values
and interests into the decision-making process. In so doing, they also must be pre-
pared to enable these newly empowered stakeholders to access the specialized
knowledges and technologies through which risks are evaluated and the actions
they require undertaken.
Such a substantial shift in trust and control dynamics will inevitably encoun-
ter obstacles and resistances along the way in relation to both the political strategy
which drives it and the outcomes the latter envisages. These are considered in the
following section.
6 Trust/Control Dynamics
The changing balance between trust and control relations under relatively unsta-
ble and uncertain contextual conditions has been a central theme in the sociology
of organizations and professions over several decades as political economies and
societies began to experience escalating levels of threat posed by interrelated eco-
logical, technological and ideological transformation (Courpasson 2000, 2006; Reed
2001; Clegg, Harris and Höpfl 2011; Courpasson, Golsorkhi and Sallaz 2012; Burns
2019; Saks 2021). Within the sociology of organizations, much of the debate centred
around the putative emergence of ‘post-bureaucratic’ or ‘network’ organizational
forms signalling a shift towards ‘softer, trust-based’ modes of governing and man-
aging and away from ‘harder, control-based’ systems in which formalized hierar-
chies and rules had played the central role in ensuring compliance with authorized
instructions ‘from above’. In the case of the sociology of professions, there was a
parallel debate over the extent to which the traditional defensiveness and exclusiv-
ity of established professionalism was giving way to a more inclusive occupational
culture and ideology under the mounting pressures generated by the internation-
alization of the market for professional services, as well as by the rationalizing dy-
namic inherent in technological change and mounting political and public hostility
to ‘expert closed shops.’

143

Both fields were analytically and substantively converging around a shared
focus on the pressures undermining established organizational and occupational
forms primarily reliant on combinations of bureaucratic and professional control
to legitimate their power and the emergence of alternative systems and cultures in
which building and sustaining ‘high trust’ relations becomes the key to securing
longer term stability and success. However, while there is an emerging shared rec-
ognition that trust and control are essential features of organizational life, there is
also a joint realization that one is not dealing with an ‘either/or’ situation here but
with a complex interplay between both factors as they shape and reshape the proc-
esses and structures through which the construction and coordination of organiza-
tional and occupational relations occurs. An increasing awareness of an over-reli-
ance and dependence on control-based governance regimes in no way guarantees
a successful move towards trust-based cultures and systems in which legitimation
struggles are ‘consigned to the dust bin of history’.
Beck, Giddens and Lash’s (1994) analysis of ‘reflexive modernization’ and the
greatly enhanced ‘institutional and organizational reflexivity’ which it implies –
that is, the capacity to self-monitor and reproduce or modify the ability of its con-
stituent systems and technologies to adjust to changing conditions and threats –
comes at a price. On the one hand, trust in relatively abstract and remote expert
systems to perform these critical monitoring and adjusting tasks becomes even
more crucial to their capacity to cope with extreme risks and the hazards they en-
tail. On the other, this also means that the ‘creation of stable abstract [expert] sys-
tems are a fraught endeavour’ (Beck, Giddens, Lash 1994: 89–90) when expertise
itself becomes more contested and divided than ever and is open to reappropria-
tion and redirection by anyone with the resources to do so. This is especially the
case when expert systems become increasingly spatially, organizationally and ex-
perientially ‘remote’ as they breakdown and traverse existing jurisdictional do-
mains in the very act of compressing time/space barriers and the political-cum-cul-
tural protection and stability they once provided.
But there is clearly a more positive side to this analysis insofar as it anticipates
the pro-active, trust-building work in which experts must engage if any kind of
acceptability and stability in the systems which they design and operate is to be
realized. In parallel, this would also require much greater accessibility and influ-
ence on the wide range of stakeholders increasingly dependent on the protection
that expert systems provide and a move towards ‘distributed control’ systems in
which their voice is heard more loudly and effectively than ever before. So,
trade unions, local governments, civic associations, voluntary organizations, social
movements and citizens assemblies would need to be empowered, not just with
the formal knowledge but also the ‘practical know-how’, to enable them to partic-
144
Chapter 6: Reflexive Expert Authority and Governance

ipate in collective decision-making arenas in which critical choices over risk man-
agement are to be made.
There are a range of decision-making levels which need to be considered in
relation to the move towards pro-active, trust building expert systems in which
more shared/participatory modes of deliberation over the evaluation of ‘risks’
and of the collective response which they require can flourish and become embed-
ded in organizational designs and routines. Experts play a vital role in ensuring
various checks and balances exist within representative pluralist democracies
by providing the expertise through which various ‘authorities’ can be challenged
and ‘held to account’ for what they have or have not done. But they can also be
seen, under certain conditions, as evolving into an unaccountable ‘technocratic
elite’ so that, rather than be identified as an undeniable asset to the maintenance
of pluralistic decision-making they become something of a liability, if not a direct
threat, to building and curating both the informal conventions and formal rules on
which the latter depends for its legitimacy and fairness (Taylor 2019: 210–233). So,
as we have seen throughout previous discussion in this book, experts and their ex-
pertise are needed in all modern societies – and particularly those in which ‘insti-
tutional reflexivity under extreme uncertainty’ has emerged as a dominant feature
of their risk management architecture – yet the expert systems they provide can
be also become enmeshed in forms of private corporate power and public admin-
istrative authority which undermine the very pluralism and openness they are
meant to protect.
At the level of the expert group – whether embedded in large, multinational
corporate organizations or more nationally/regionally-based professional bodies
and occupational associations – various regulatory and governmental mechanisms
provide some degree of formal transparency and accountability to the wider com-
munities in which they operate. However, the need to strengthen the latter in
the light of growing concerns over the inherent limitations of established regula-
tory machinery in the face of escalating accusations over political/cultural elitism
and technocratic rule has been recognized. As we have already seen, a robust ‘civic
epistemology that guides what is expected by way of evidence in public decision-
making and identifies who is to be recognized as able to provide that evidence’
(Collins et al. 2020: 79–80) is an essential structural prerequisite for achieving a
better balance between public trust and expert control in pluralistic democracies.
This needs to be supplemented by other ‘checks and balances’ mechanisms build-
ing public trust in specialist expertise but also ensuring that it remains open to
democratic scrutiny and accountability to the wider society that both depends
on it and defends it against unwarranted political interference or indifference.
These additional ‘checks and balances’ mechanisms would be focused on open-
ing-up expert decision-making to broader social and political debates around

how complex problems and the risks they present needs to draw on a diversity of
specialist and lay expertise if they are to be collectively overcome. Breaking down
barriers between ‘experts’ and ‘non-experts’ in ways that facilitate building more
robust and lasting consensus within and between them over ‘what should be done’
when dealing with high-risk situations would seem to offer a preferable way for-
ward to the hierarchically driven and exclusionary strategies dominant under the
orthodox model of expert authority as outlined in the first chapter of this book.
Yet, when moving beyond the level of expert groups to the ‘corporate behe-
moths’ in which an increasing number of them – particularly those working in pri-
vate and public sector corporations with the organizational capacity and reach
to make fateful decisions impacting on all our lives – are employed, then the
‘trust/control dynamics’ become especially challenging. Of course, there is, in one
sense, nothing new about the multiple ways in which large scale, powerful corpo-
rations have come to dominate contemporary economic, social and political life as
revealed in Freeman’s (2018) historical analysis of the growth of the ‘factory sys-
tem’ in late eighteenth/early nineteenth century England to early twenty-first cen-
tury ‘Foxconn City’ in China and Vietnam. But the early twenty-first century high
tech corporate giants through which ‘surveillance capitalism’ (Zuboff 2019) and the
‘surveillance state’ (Striitmatter 2019) have become institutional realities seem to
present configurations of expert power and control way beyond the reach of
any form of democratic scrutiny or accountability (Pasquale 2015; Taylor 2019;
Daub 2020). In many ways, they – and the financial corporate giants which now
operate alongside them (Lapavitsas 2013; Wilks 2013; Vogl 2017) – have come to ex-
emplify what Wolin (2004: 605) defines as the structural essence of twenty-first
century corporate power in the form of ‘a permanent revolution instigated and
perpetuated by elites [as] represented in what I have called the hybrid of the cor-
porate state’. For him, the central political and ethical challenge which this ‘perma-
nent revolution from above’ presents are that of ‘nurturing a discordant democra-
cy [which] in being rooted in the ordinary, it affirms the value of limits … the task
is to nurture the civic conscience of society’ (Wolin 2004: 606).
A much more reflexive form of expert authority and governance, we contend,
has a vital role to play in ‘nurturing a discordant democracy and civic conscience’
by assisting challenges to closed corporate decision-making in ways which expose
it to political, legal and ethical scrutiny in its darkest corners and recesses.
Zuboff ’s (2019) dissection of the structural mechanisms on which ‘surveillance
capitalism’ depends for its cycle of exploitation to function effectively (see chapter
two of this book for a more detailed discussion) also includes some analysis of how
it might be challenged and resisted. In this context, she emphasizes the crucial im-
portance of ‘decision rights’, and the various ways in which ‘we’, the public, can
proactively reclaim control over the knowledge and information from big tech
146
Chapter 6: Reflexive Expert Authority and Governance

companies which enable them to exploit our everyday lives and needs by ‘mone-
tizing’ them into saleable services and products accruing vast profits in the proc-
ess. In addition, these surveillance systems and control technologies can be turned
towards political, rather than economic, strategies aimed at manipulating voting
behaviour and other forms of democratic participation to ensure outcomes favour-
ing the powerful and wealthy elites who benefit most from their operation. Both
in regard of reclaiming economic and political ‘decision rights’, Zuboff sees a crit-
ical role for a wide range of experts in challenging and correcting the ‘knowledge
asymmetries’ embedded in the highly concentrated forms of corporate power and
control surveillance capitalism depends on for its functioning and reproduction.
She identifies three, interrelated arenas in which the ‘trust/control’ dynamics in-
herent in surveillance capitalism can be changed in favour of citizens and com-
munities reclaiming their economic and political decision rights: first, by repurpos-
ing expert knowledge and skill to make the public much more self-aware as to
what surveillance capitalism is taking from them by way of re-asserting self-pos-
session of our digital lives; second, by assisting individuals, groups, organizations
and movements demanding the strengthening of the legal and non-statutory reg-
ulation of the mechanisms and processes through which digital exploitation rou-
tinely occurs; thirdly, by experts putting their knowledge and skill at the disposal
of various private and public sector interventions aimed at enhancing competitive
forces and weakening the dominant monopoly control of the high tech corporate
behemoths.
Zuboff ’s overall strategy for ‘democratizing knowledge’ through reclaiming
decision rights over our economic, political and social selves as ‘digital agents’ is
paralleled by other researchers and writers who seek to nurture citizens’ trust
and participation in a ‘discordant democracy and civil conscience ‘in the face of
the over weaning power and control of high tech/finance corporations. Pasquale’s
(2015) analysis of the ‘black box society’ focuses on the need to critique and refute
the ‘techno-libertarianism’ which ideologically and politically underpins the power
of the high-tech giants and the strategic institutional nexus emerging between
them and the high finance giants. He further suggests that this will only be realized
when there is a substantial political and cultural shift against the high tech/finance
power corporate networks so that the once popular mantra of ‘leaving it to the
tech/fin experts’ is challenged by other experts in law enforcements agencies, pub-
lic service bureaucracies and civil society movements determined to ‘open up the
black box of surveillance and secrecy’ to interrogation by a ‘countervailing power’
(Galbraith 1952, 1967) moving against a digital aristocracy. This analysis is echoed in
Daub’s (2020) deconstruction of what he calls ‘Silicon Valley thinking’ in which an
unrestrained libertarian ideology is discursively fused with a political theory deny-
ing the legitimacy of any form of expert authority grounded in ‘any large collective
6 Trust/Control Dynamics
147

group having an accumulated sense of how best to do certain things’ (Daub 2020:
64). Although professing a belief in ‘heroic individualism’ and untrammelled mar-
ket competition, the corporate elite of Silicon Valley collectively think and act in
ways which ensure their monopoly control is maintained in the face of all threats
to its preservation. They see themselves as ‘disrupters of tradition’ undermining
any attempts made by experts acting in the name of counter movements to chal-
lenge their status as ‘keepers of an esoteric knowledge few others possess’ (Daub
2020: 111) and the inalienable rights this gives them to protect others who may be
led astray by countervailing sources of expertise.
All these studies cumulatively demonstrate the need for a ‘countervailing theo-
ry of expert authority and governance’ analytically grounded in reflexive modes
of collective agency and drawing on the specialist knowledge and skills provided
by expert groups and organizations prepared to put their epistemological resour-
ces and technical ‘know how’ to work for the benefit of a ‘discordant democracy
and civic conscience’. As Galbraith (1952, 1967) repeatedly emphasizes, the major
source of countervailing power in modern capitalism must come from within
the ‘technostructure’ or ‘internal planning systems’ of private corporations, public
sector organizations and third sector agencies as their constituent expert groups
collectively learn how to challenge the legitimacy of unrestrained neoliberal cap-
italism and the elite interests it protects. Adler’s (2019) analysis of the ‘99 percent
economy’ provides a contemporary theoretical and empirical expression of the
critical importance of ‘expert countervailing power’ in describing the very dif-
ferent kinds of roles experts play under the collaborative forms of working and
learning made possible by democratized modes of knowledge accumulation and
participative forms of strategic planning and management. As such, experts will
necessarily play a pivotal role in ensuring a better balance between centralization
and participation in large, complex organizations because they provide the special-
ist knowledge and technical skills through which functional silos and departmental
fiefdoms can be broken down and replaced by more powerful ‘knowledge net-
works and repositories’ facilitating more shared and collaborative decision-mak-
ing. He also provides examples of this process ‘in action’ within corporations
such as Kaiser Permanente, IBM and Toyota in which staff experts have played
a major role in reshaping real organizational conditions through building and
maintaining the collaborative forms of collective working and democratic learning
in which strategic needs and operational realities can be more finely adjusted and
balanced.
While these more participative and reflexive organizational innovations often
decay and ‘run out of innovative steam’, they demonstrate the possibilities that
more high trust, collaborative knowledge systems and team-based working open-
up for complex private and public sector organizations and the wider communities
148
Chapter 6: Reflexive Expert Authority and Governance

and societies in which they are located. Expert groups perform a vital role in man-
aging the endemic tensions between ‘trusting participation’ and ‘controlling cen-
tralization’ in ways that generate more sustainable modes of reflexive collabora-
tion, organization and governance.
7 Reflexive Expert Authority and Governance
In chapter 1, figure 1 of this book we set out the key features of the ideal typical
model of ‘legal rational expert authority and governance’. The latter, in summary
form, has five, interrelated structural components defining its analytical dis-
tinctiveness and their explanatory implications: first, ‘epistemological exclusion’;
second, ‘jurisdictional closure’; third, ‘autonomous self-regulation’; fourth, ‘elite
state sponsorship’; and finally, ‘institutionalized passive trust’.
We now set out, in the penultimate section of this chapter, the key features of
the ideal typical model of ‘reflexive expert authority and governance’ and their ex-
planatory implications for emerging forms of the latter under current and foresee-
able conditions.
The legal rational model of expert authority and governance starts from the
axiomatic assumption of an ‘exclusionary epistemology’ in which specialist knowl-
edge and skills are systematically accumulated and protected from external influ-
ences through the construction of various cognitive and institutional ‘barriers to
entry’ of both an informal and formal kind.While the former relates to occupation-
al socialization and acculturation, the latter are more a matter of legal and ad-
ministrative regulatory processes embedded in professional and quasi-professio-
nal accreditation or licensing in which an underlying ‘meritocratic ideology’
plays a central legitimating role (Taylor 2019; Sandel 2020).
However, the ideal typical model of reflexive authority and governance, in
stark contrast, is analytically anchored in an ‘inclusionary epistemology’ in
which specialist knowledge and skills are opened-up and made much more widely
available to the lay public for their edification and scrutiny. Cognitive and institu-
tional barriers to meaningful ‘civic participation’ in the epistemological processes
through which specialist knowledge and skills are generated, learnt and assessed
are gradually diluted in favour of more collegiate, collaborative and coproduced
modes of knowledge acquisition and application (Clarke et al. 2007; Ferlie et al.
2013; Newman 2013; Crouch 2016; Eyal 2019). This also logically implies that the pre-
sumption of a clear and consistent dividing line between ‘science’ and ‘politics’ or
‘expert’ and ‘lay’ understanding can no longer be made as the axiomatic starting
point for theorizing contemporary forms of expert authority and governance.
7 Reflexive Expert Authority and Governance
149

Yet, as Eyal (2019: 145) reminds us, this ‘conceptual bottom-line commitment’ to
‘participatory science and “hybrid forums” composed of experts and lay people,
who put their trust in the foregrounding of uncertainty [must] reckon with the in-
convenient fact that openness, inclusion, transparency, and participation do not, by
themselves, secure legitimacy’. Any substantial and significant movement towards
the inclusionary epistemology which is the conceptual loadstone for the ideal type
of model of reflexive authority and governance must recognize that a ‘new consen-
sus’ around expert knowledge and its legitimate application must be constructed
and that the latter is likely to be fraught with all sorts of seemingly intractable is-
sues and disputes. Again, as Eyal (2019:145–146) concludes ‘legitimacy depends on
the ability to bring reasoned debate to an end, or at least a temporary halt (while
keeping its potential continuation in sight). The inconvenient fact is that participa-
tory and inclusive hybrid forums lack mechanisms for doing so, or they are ex-
tremely vulnerable to strategies which exploit the weaknesses of whatever mech-
anism they possess’.
This takes us to the second conceptual component of reflexive expert authority
and governance in its ideal typical form – that is, the shift form ‘jurisdictional clo-
sure’ to ‘jurisdictional consensus’. Here we are focusing on the work task do-
mains in which the specialist knowledge and skills of experts is deployed and
the organizational structures and technologies which link them together to form
integrated work units equipped to carry out complex projects and problem-solving.
Moves towards civic or participatory epistemologies logically demand more ‘trans
domain’ modes of working in which experts pool and share their knowledge and
skills, both between themselves and with the lay communities in which they oper-
ate, as a precursor to achieving enhanced collective learning and understanding
in highly uncertain decision-making situations (Blowers, Boersema and Martin
2005; Fischer 2003; Elstub and McLaverty 2014). Of course, organizational and in-
stitutional politics will continue to shape and reshape the actual hybrid modes
of expert working that will empirically emerge ‘on the ground’ and the processes
through which expert inter-domain jurisdictions are negotiated and justified. But
the model of reflexive authority and governance insists that the role and legitima-
cy of ‘experts and ‘expertise’ can no longer be defined and realized through the
‘politics of jurisdictional closure’ but now crucially depends on a continuing
quest to achieve a workable consensus around overlapping and shared modes of
specialist working that will inevitably change as the context in which they are lo-
cated changes. However, this requirement for consensus-based jurisdictional work
organization must also accept the much higher levels of contestability and instabil-
ity which they necessarily entail as the world of defensive jurisdictional closure
gives way to one in which the latter is both unacceptable and unattainable because
150
Chapter 6: Reflexive Expert Authority and Governance

it cannot deal with the nature and scale of the challenges, we face in the twenty-
first century.
Analytically combining ‘epistemological inclusion’ and ‘jurisdictional consen-
sus’ gives the third conceptual component of the ideal type of reflexive expert au-
thority and governance – that is, ‘embedded management and regulation’ which
rejects the logic of autonomous self-management and regulation dominant under
the legal rational model outlined in chapter one. Embedded management and reg-
ulation insist that the legitimacy of expert knowledge and the interventionist strat-
egies and technologies which they facilitate can no longer depend upon ‘experts
policing themselves’. Instead of expert occupational groups, organizations and
associations being the sole, or at least primary, arbiter of their performance in
an ethical, technical or legal sense, embedded forms of expert governance and reg-
ulation give a much-expanded role to external, community-based modes of scruti-
ny and evaluation which often critique and reject the insularity and narrowness of
performance review mechanisms where the expert remains ‘on top’. No longer
prepared to accept, passively and paternalistically, the ‘immaculate conception’
or ‘crown jewels’ model of expert authority in which claims to expertise and its
performance-enhancing properties can be accepted with little by way of ‘external
checks and balances’, these guarantees are now subjected to interrogation by the
stakeholder communities they are meant to serve. What Oreskes (2019: 247–248)
calls ‘transformative interrogation within agnostic fields’ goes significantly beyond
expert domains of specialist knowledge and skill to encompass, intellectually and
institutionally, much wider spheres of communal activity and practice in which
stakeholder values and interests are taken much more seriously into account. Em-
bedded expert management and regulation moves beyond the corridors of elite
power and control to include collective voices and opinions often drowned out,
or at least marginalized, within established expert governance structures and
the proprietary interests which they protect.
Yet, there is no getting away from the fact that a move towards embedded
management and regulation is likely to prove discomforting, not to say discombob-
ulating, for most expert occupational groups and organizations who now find
themselves in a situation where they must be much more accommodating, even
welcoming, to external checks and balances restricting their autonomy and con-
trol. Under the legal rational ideal type of expert authority, experts can rely on rel-
atively abstract, remote and formalized governance structures and regulative sys-
tems in which the political and administrative practices which they necessarily
entail for their practical operation are hidden from public view and challenge (Ez-
zamel and Reed 2006). Embedded management and regulation logically demand,
as a precondition for securing and retaining ‘practical expert legitimacy’, regulato-
ry mechanisms and processes which are much closer to – spatially, politically and
7 Reflexive Expert Authority and Governance
151

organizationally – the civic communities in which they operate and the represen-
tative agencies through which they mobilize public opinion over issues which mat-
ter to them. Governance and regulatory arrangements under the legal rational
model of expert authority are logically driven by ostensibly objective ‘efficiency
and effectiveness criteria’ relating to how principals can control their agents with-
in ‘low trust’, market-based exchanges at minimum cost and disruption (Ezzamel
and Reed 2006). However, the reflexive ideal type works with an entirely different
‘risk calculus’ in which the instrumental rationality dominating the legal rational
model gives way to a substantive rationality in which long-term, high trust rela-
tionships between all stakeholders gradually emerge from the ‘transformative in-
terrogation within agnostic fields’ (Oreskes 2019: 247–248) in which the latter
are continually engaged as they struggle to come to terms with high risk, complex
problem solving under extreme uncertainty. Expert groups and organizations are
an essential and critical component of the interrogative deliberation processes
through which collective decision-making occurs, but they must be prepared to ac-
cept the additional external regulatory restraints that the latter imposes on their
internal operation and governance.
This model of reflexive expert authority and governance is not premised on
some utopian or idealistic premise of a ‘politics free’ decision-making process
in which a universal ideological commitment to collective values and interests
eradicates, or at least marginalizes, sectional divisions and conflicts to a point
where they all but disappear. Instead, ‘politics’ remains at the analytical core
and substantive base of the reflexive ideal type in that it actively embraces the so-
cial reality of contestation between opposing interests and values as indelibly
shaping the ‘trust/control dynamics’ underpinning expert authority and the mech-
anism through which it is legitimated and regulated. It is grounded in the logical
premise that the legitimacy struggles in which expert groups and organizations are
necessarily engaged cannot be democratically conducted or resolved unless ex-
perts accept the need to share their expertise with others through communal dia-
logue and collective deliberation in which a far wider range of voices and opinions
are actively welcomed into the decision-making arena than is normally the case
under status quo conditions.
Prioritizing embedded modes of reflexive expert management and regulation
logically leads on to the fourth analytical element of the ideal type – that is, the
transition from ‘elite state sponsorship’ towards ‘pluralistic stakeholder sponsor-
ship’ in which governance regimes dominated by closed networks of ruling groups
and the ‘passive trust’ they rely on gives way to proactive support and engagement
on the part of multiple stakeholder groups and the experts working with them.
While the former legitimates its authority through prioritizing hierarchy, meritoc-
racy, stability and inequality, the latter contends that an embedded mode of expert
152
Chapter 6: Reflexive Expert Authority and Governance

management and regulation can only become a practical reality if it emerges from
a fundamental shift in value commitments where collegiality, participation, en-
gagement and equality become the guiding principles. Rather than be seen as
the defenders and protectors of privilege, exclusivity and impunity, expert groups
and organizations are reimagined and repurposed as collaborators in collective
mobility projects aimed at translating democratic ideals into practical collective ac-
tion focused on making elite political and economic decision-makers accountable
to the publics they serve and the core values which any democratic polity worthy
of the name should embody.
Overshadowing much of the exposition and analysis provided in this book is a
growing awareness that the ‘crisis in expert authority’ is an integral part of a larg-
er ‘crisis in elitist managerial politics.’ This conjunctural crisis in elite and expert
authority can be interpreted as the cumulative outcome of successive failures on
the part of both groups to deliver on the promises of economic prosperity, social
mobility and cultural integration made to an increasingly sceptical and disillu-
sioned public distrustful of its political leaders’ capacity to govern on their behalf
(Runciman 2013; Stiglitz 2013; Seymour 2014; Glaser 2018; Koppl 2018; Babones 2018;
Applebaum 2020; Taylor 2019; Davies 2020a; Frank 2020; Bickerton and Accetti
2021). Much of what might loosely be called the ‘populist critique’ of elitist mana-
gerial/expert politics emerges out of and ideologically exploits this increasing pub-
lic consciousness of repeated, ‘across the board’ failure by political elites and their
technocratic advisors to deal effectively with the escalating risks and threats which
the general public now routinely confronts. Rather than prompt a serious reap-
praisal of how elitist managerial politics operates and the results it produces,
this succession of mounting failures – to, for example, reduce persistent and wid-
ening socio-economic inequality or to integrate health and social care or to deal
effectively with a pandemic – has directly reinforced the retreat into even more
closed and exclusive forms of political decision-making and governing in which
‘the people’ play little or no part. Elites and experts hide behind defensive institu-
tional barriers and esoteric organizational enclaves that make it even more diffi-
cult for ordinary members of society and polity to access the decision-making are-
nas which govern their lives. Babones (2018: 38) captures the polemical core of this
populist critique of elitist managerial politics when he suggests that ‘the authority
of experts and the money of the rich ensure that liberal points of view are always
prominently aired in political debates, but liberals as a group are never numerical-
ly strong enough to win elections under universal suffrage’. He then proceeds to
argue that the insidious ‘new authoritarianism’ of the expert class has been direct-
ly challenged by the ‘populist purgative’ of Trump, Brexit and the International Ref-
ugee Crisis.
7 Reflexive Expert Authority and Governance
153

One of the fundamental errors of this kind of analysis is that it ignores the
simple but axiomatic truth that expert knowledge and skill are prerequisites for
the survival and functioning, much less flourishing, of any modern society, econo-
my and polity facing complex or ‘wicked problems’ in which the ‘decision stakes’
are very high indeed (Brown 2015). While the threat of technocratic rule by illegit-
imate and unaccountable experts is real enough, it cannot be resisted, much less
assuaged, by denying ‘expertise’ any kind of legitimate authority or strategic
role and placing collective trust in the ‘will of the people’ and those political lead-
ers who purport to speak in their name without any regard to the extensive plural-
ity and diversity of values and interests inherent to modernity.
As Brown (2014: 57) contends ‘citizens must trust experts [but] their trust need
not be blind. Lay citizens and their representatives need effective opportunities to
hold experts to account’. Drawing on the pragmatism of Dewey, Harbermas’ model
of deliberative democracy, and policy studies literature, Brown outlines an analyt-
ical framework for identifying the institutional architecture, discursive norms,
communicative principles and political processes through which pluralistic stake-
holder sponsorship of expert authority can be mobilized and sustained. This
framework specifies a ‘dual track model’ of deliberative democracy built on Hab-
ermas’ distinction between ‘track one’ of formal state institutions and professional
bureaucracies and ‘track two’ of the informal public sphere of civil society empow-
ered organizations and movements. The critical role of the latter is to discursively
and practically challenge expert authority in institutional arenas and organization-
al locales in which horizontal rather than vertical power is emphasized and where
non-professional, ‘experiential expertise’ is, formally and informally, given voice
and support from civil society representative groups and agencies. Thus, ‘lay judge-
ments of expert authority need to employ both epistemic and social criteria’
(Brown 2014: 57) so that the legitimacy of expert authority does not depend on ‘un-
questioning acceptance’, but the ‘tacit trust’ based on lay experience given so much
emphasis in Collins et al. (2009, 2020).
Finally, Brown (2014) outlines a typology or roles that ‘trustworthy experts’
might play, particularly when dealing with the high risk/high stakes decision-mak-
ing discussed earlier on in this chapter. Adapting his typology somewhat, we might
analytically identify four role types: the ‘pure expert’, the ‘expert arbiter’, the ‘ex-
pert advocate’ and the ‘expert broker’. This envisages a spectrum of possibilities
beginning with epistemic expertise in the case of the ‘pure expert’ and moving
through to a much greater emphasis on social and political expertise in the case
of the ‘expert broker’. However, none of the four role types can be viable without
the trust-building and reinforcing practices on which any form of reflexive author-
ity and governance depends for its legitimacy and authenticity.

Chapter 6: Reflexive Expert Authority and Governance

Indeed, this takes us to the fifth and final analytical component of the ideal
type of reflexive expert authority and governance – that is, the foundational im-
portance of proactive, negotiated trust as opposed to the passive, institutional-
ized trust underpinning the legal rational model. Throughout the analysis devel-
oped in this chapter we have repeatedly returned to the centrality of proactive,
negotiated trust to the legitimacy and viability of expert authority under the reflex-
ive model. This emphasizes the reality of the inherently contested, provisional and
contingent nature of negotiated trust in expert authority under the analytical pre-
cepts on which the reflexive model is logically constructed and justified. Insofar as
experts are primarily ‘mediators’ – that is, their primary role is as mediators or
brokers ‘between established stocks of knowledge, new developments and urgent
demands for action’ (Stehr and Grundmann 2011: xi) – then they are only able to
fulfil this generic function if their expertise is trusted by those who depend on it to
make decisions ranging from highly complex strategic policy issues to everyday
routine problem solving. However, this implicit public trust in explicit or tacit ex-
pertise is never unconditional or universal; by making complexity manageable ex-
perts reduce anxiety generating uncertainty for the rest of society, but they can
only do this if ‘trust becomes a central component of the social relationship be-
tween expert and client’ (Stehr and Grundmann 2011: 43).
By establishing their credibility and reliability within society, experts repro-
duce legitimacy for their authority and status as trustworthy interpreters and me-
diators utilizing their specialist knowledge and skill to identify the options availa-
ble to decision makers facing difficult and often poorly understood problems. Yet,
by setting the decision-making context and agenda in this way, they inevitably be-
come key players in the political processes that coalesce around the issues which
the former frame; as such, they play a pivotal role in ‘negotiating order’ by delicate-
ly navigating their course through contending interests and values. Any attempt to
maintain a cast iron separation between ‘science’ and ‘politics’ is likely to founder
in this situation where the experts have no option but to pay the entry price for
becoming the key actors in decision-making contexts likely to have profound con-
sequences for societies and their members.
Under these kind of conditions – where trust must be negotiated, credibility
won, and legitimacy fought for in an ongoing political struggle – reliance on insti-
tutionalized or ‘passive trust’ is no longer a viable option for reflexive forms of
expert authority and governance in conditions where many of the support mech-
anisms shoring up the former have become corroded and weakened. As interpret-
ers and mediators of specialist knowledges and skills, experts ‘use the leeway that
exists between the production of knowledge and the need for advice, between the
uncertainty of scientific facts and the need to take action, between the release of
scientific research and knowledge and the urgent day-to-day business’ (Stehr and
7 Reflexive Expert Authority and Governance
155

Grundmann 2011: 118). They can no longer fall back on institutionalized hierarchies
of trust and control because the internal dynamics and external context of the lat-
ter have moved way beyond those hierarchies’ legitimacy and authority.
The five key structural features of the ideal type of reflexive expert authority
are set out in Figure 2 below and offer, in a logically and conceptually extreme
form, a directly opposed configuration to the ideal type of neo-Weberian or legal
rational expert authority specified in chapter one, Figure 1 of this book. Any em-
pirical form of expert authority will consist of a selective recombination of ele-
ments drawn from each of these logically contrasting types, depending on the con-
ditions under which they operate, and the strategic choices made by powerful and
influential actors facing the latter. However, the trajectory of the analysis provided
in this book very strongly suggests that there is an underlying movement towards
hybrid forms of expert authority in which the conceptual elements associated with
the ideal type of reflexive authority are likely to become stronger and more pro-
nounced, while those associated with the legal rational type are diluted and weak-
ened. Nevertheless, there is no ‘historical promise or guarantee’ of movement in
this direction because the complex interplay between ‘agency’ and ‘structure’ gen-
erates a dynamically moving socio-historical context in which several possible out-
comes can emerge and find traction.

8 Conclusion
In this chapter we have set out the key conceptual features of reflexive expert
authority in ideal typical terms and contrasted it with the Neo-Weberian legal ra-
tional type outlined in chapter one. Although substantive forms of expert authority
will display combinations and re-combinations of elements drawn from both
types, we have also argued that these are likely to exhibit stronger features of
the reflexive form. We think this is the case to the extent that the latter is much
better equipped to handle the competing challenges and pressures that legitima-
tion struggles over expertise in the twenty-first century will continue to present
to societies in which high risk decision-making becomes more commonplace. In
turn, this will also require a shift in the ‘trust/control’ dynamics of reflexive expert
authority in which trust-building under conditions of increasing complexity and
uncertainty is a prerequisite for effectively engaging publics, experts, and states
in expert practices to generate collective learning and collaborative decision-mak-
ing.
However, a substantial move in the direction of reflexive expert authority
doesn’t solve or remove the fundamental dilemma or conundrum which lies at
the core of legitimation struggles over expertise – that is, the structural tension
between public acceptance of the primacy to be afforded to expert knowledge in
decision-making situations and public trust that experts will not misuse their dis-
cretionary powers for their own or others’ advantage. Expert authority, whatever
form it takes, is about exercising power and control in decision-making contexts
which, by their very nature, are open to ‘multiple authorities’ and the ‘expert sys-
tems’ that they rely on to justify and implement the decisions they take – or don’t
take. Expert systems and the technologies they rely on are designed and operated
by specialists on behalf of elite groups to, directly and remotely, monitor and con-
trol ordinary people in their working and domestic lives. The former has a built-in
tendency to favour remote control logics that disembody and decontextualize ‘local
experience and knowledge’ in ways which make it amenable to manipulation and
closure in the furtherance of other objectives such as surveillance, resocialization
or profit (Beck, Giddens and Lash 1994). Yet, this dynamic of remote control fatally
weakens the generalized trust it needs to cultivate and sustain the acceptance and
stability it craves if its legitimacy is to be secured.
Reflexive expert authority significantly moves the trust/control dynamic more
in favour of localized trust-building and away from remote control, but ‘openness,
inclusion, transparency, and participation do not, by themselves, secure legitimacy’
(Eyal 2019: 145). As Eyal (2019) also argues, making expert decision-making pro-
cesses more accessible and amenable to public participation runs all sorts of addi-
tional risks, including increasing the influence of powerful groups and organiza-
8 Conclusion

tions who gain legitimate entry to the former on an ‘openness/inclusive ticket’ with
the aim and means of turning them in directions they favour rather than for the
public good. Sectional interests and values are given extended opportunities to
make their presence felt in more reflexive and participative modes of expert deci-
sion-making and they can effectively take control of the process by undermining
the credibility of and trust in those who supposedly speak in the name of ‘exper-
tise’.
In this respect, support for a move towards more reflexive forms of expert au-
thority does not expunge the dilemma which lies at the core of the neo-Weberian
legal rational model – that is, how to ensure the accountability and legitimacy of
expertise to the publics which it serves, while simultaneously ensuring that the lat-
ter has sufficient autonomy and capacity to do its job of ‘“bringing the bad news”
[and] teaching others how to “recognize inconvenient facts”’ (Eyal 2019: 149).
In the following chapter we consider how this core ‘trust/control’ dilemma
might be handled under different trajectories and forms of future expert authority
and governance as they take shape against the background context of contestation,
instability and uncertainty emerging from our analysis so far.

Chapter 7: Expert Futures
1 Introduction
‘Business as usual’ for the established approach to expert authority is no longer
viable, analytically or substantively, because the socio-historical context in which
it was promulgated has changed dramatically in ways that severely weaken its
core theoretical premises and empirical claims. In particular, the assumption
that institutionalized trust could and would continue to legitimate legal rational
expert authority in ways that protected it from sustained threats and challenges
to its coherence and stability cannot be sustained in a world in which ‘multiple au-
thorities’ have the capacity to mount extended campaigns against its authenticity
and veracity. Established modes of expert authority are ‘in the firing line’ and will
continue to be so for the foreseeable future. They can no longer hide behind an
institutional carapace of taken-for-granted ideological conventions and structural
protections which attempt to laminate the ‘politics of expertise’ in a veneer of sci-
entism and technocracy.
Yet, even the alternative models of expert authority which have been devel-
oped in response to the perceived weaknesses of the orthodox model, such as
the reflexive mode we have outlined at some length in the previous chapter of
this book, will continue to struggle with the ‘trust/control’ dilemma or dynamic
which is to be found at the centre of any theorization of such a complex phenom-
enon. Thus, the various scenarios of ‘expert futures’ which we develop in this chap-
ter will be forced to confront the structural contradictions and dynamic tensions
between ‘expert control’ and ‘lay trust’ that lies at the heart of any socio-political
process striving to legitimate expert knowledge and skill in a world of multiple and
competing authorities.
In this chapter, we will review four scenarios which map out rather differ-
ent ‘futures’ for expert authority in a world in which it is widely accepted ‘experts
alone should not determine the purposes for which their expertise is used’ (Brown
2014: 57) but also the reality that ‘at some point, expertise inevitably depends not
on persuasion but authority’ (Brown 2014: 59). First, we will look at attempts to re-
habilitate ‘meritocracy’ as the ideological and institutional cornerstone of a revivi-
fied conception of expert authority in which ‘the aristocracy of talent’ (Wooldridge
2021) is rebuilt on solid social and ethical foundations. Secondly, we examine the
vision of an expert future in which ‘technopopulism’ has become the dominant
ideological and political strategy for wining and retaining power in contemporary
representative democracies (Bickerton and Accetti 2021). Thirdly, we assess the
emergence of ‘civic’ or ‘connective’ professionalism as a potential hybrid strategy
https://doi.org/10.1515/9783110734911-008

for redefining and reworking the future occupational cultures and organizational
architectures through which expert work is legitimated (Clarke et al. 2007; Noorde-
graaf 2015, 2020). Finally, we turn to the concept of ‘critical elitism’ as it develops a
model of expert of authority in which contestation between a wide range of expert
institutions, civil society organizations, and democratic movements – collectively
striving to fashion a ‘dynamic consensus’ over how expertise should be legitimately
authorized and deployed in a pluralistic democracy – emerges as the hallmark of
twenty-first century expertise (Moore 2017).
2 Meritocracy Recrudescent
We have already seen that ‘meritocracy’ has been subject to a series of excoriating
critiques and attacks of late which fundamentally challenge its intellectual coher-
ence and institutional capacity to legitimate unequal access to and control over ex-
pert knowledge and skills through occupational and organizational mechanisms
guaranteeing ‘equality of opportunity’ and ‘fairness of outcomes’ (Taylor 2019; San-
del 2020). Going much further than earlier critiques focused around the ‘latent’ as
opposed to ‘manifest’ functioning of meritocratic ideology and practice – that is,
their actual role in promoting and protecting structures of inequality rather
than opening them up to genuine competition and increasing opportunities for
social mobility (Young 1958) – recent critiques have concentrated more on meritoc-
racy’s necessary connection with ‘credentialism’ and its strategic role in perpetu-
ating elite power structures closed off from any kind of democratic scrutiny and
accountability. They see credentialism as an integrative mechanism through
which professional elites legitimate their occupational power and social status
by systemically linking educational attainment and career progression together.
‘Winners’ are awarded the top jobs based on their educational performance and
‘losers’ are justifiably denied access to these elite positions due to their failure
to secure the necessary credentials which entry into elite circles and networks re-
quires (Sandel 2020; Frank 2020). By ideologically cloaking elite professional self
interest in the meritocratic discourse of ‘equality of opportunity’ and ‘fair compe-
tition’, credentialism makes the securing of high-level educational qualifications a
political and moral justification for the perpetuation of socio-economic inequality
and cultural division. What Sandel (2020: 104) labels ‘the diploma divide’ generates
a ‘relentless credentialism [driving] working class voters towards populist and na-
tionalist parties and deepened the divide between those with and those without a
university degree’, as well as legitimating a belief in a mode of technocratic gover-
nance overriding any residual concern with democratic niceties.
160
Chapter 7: Expert Futures

Taylor (2019: 210–211) takes this critique further by insisting that ‘expertise is
inherently undemocratic’ because it necessarily excludes most citizens from its de-
liberations and, over time, gives rise to an elite class based on the principle of mer-
itocracy ‘which means the rule of a class of educated or otherwise advantaged peo-
ple while most citizens are frozen out’. Thus, educational attainment becomes a
‘sorting mechanism’ whereby ‘the best’ go on to the top-level elite jobs in business,
government, media and communication while ‘the rest’ are consigned to middle
and lower-level positions. But within this ‘technocratic-meritocratic’ approach to
educational attainment and occupational allocation, ‘everybody has a chance’ be-
cause the performance criteria for success are clearly stipulated and potentially
achievable by all those who enter the educational system. By institutionally and
ideologically tying credentialism and meritocracy together in this way, expert sta-
tus and authority can be legitimated on the presumption that it’s an outcome of a
competitive process in which there is equality of access and mobility to the extent
that it transparently rewards those who perform best in a rule-based and objec-
tively measured system of educational attainment.
Much of the analysis and critique of technocratically-meritocratically legiti-
mated expert authority is anticipated in Collins’ book The Credential Society
(2019), originally published in 1979, but at a time when suspicion of, if not hostility
to, expert authority was only beginning to gather political pace and cultural mo-
mentum which rapidly accelerated in the following decades. His book provides a
detailed historical and sociological analysis of what he calls the ‘credential system’
in the US between the mid-nineteenth and mid-twentieth centuries in which the
rapid expansion and institutionalization of the tertiary education sector is closely
linked to the ethos or ideology of ‘technocracy’. The latter, he continues, legitimates
the massive ‘proliferation of professional and technical degrees and their control
over specialized work enclaves’ (Collins 2019: 117) thus establishing a very high de-
gree of integration between a system of educational stratification and occupational
stratification which is structurally, materially, and culturally advantageous to the
professional, managerial, and expert classes. In this way, Collins (2019: 120) isolates
the growth of the educational credential system as the ‘most direct agent’ generat-
ing the expansion of professional and other related forms of expert occupational
labour and the very powerful occupational associations and elite groups which
have emerged to promote and protect their collective interests and values.
These professional and related expert occupational groups, he opines, have
come to be regarded as ‘the saviours of the modern world’ (Collins 2019: 175),
even if they sometimes fall somewhat short of this idealized vision through ‘pro-
fessional hubris’ as a recurring organizational dynamic (Tourish 2019) or in the
form of systemic ‘professional resistance’ to external scrutiny and accountability
(Picard, Durocher and Gendron 2021). Nevertheless, such professional/expert bod-
2 Meritocracy Recrudescent
161

ies and organizations have deployed political and cultural power very effectively
in defence of their ‘monopoly and self-governing rights by getting the force of
the state to license them and back up their collective authority’ (Collins 2019:
177). They have also successfully engaged in a series of sophisticated ‘mystification
strategies’ (see chapter three of this book) in which various forms of occupational
secrecy, emotional manipulation, and discursive dissembling play a central role in
protecting their autonomy and authority. Overall, he concludes, professionalization
through meritocracy and credentialism ‘is an extension of the age-old struggles of
self-interested groups using refinements of traditional tactics’ (Collins 2019: 180).
While recognizing the reality of professional/expert altruism as embodied both
in ethical codes and occupational cultures/practices, Collins’ sociohistorical analy-
sis continually emphasizes the strategic role of meritocracy and credentialism in
providing the integrated stratification mechanism whereby expert groups secure
the patronage of the state in licensing their monopolistic control over critical juris-
dictional domains within the workplace.
Although Collins (2019: 253–270) notes that the credential system which has
come to dominate American education and employment has undergone a series
of rolling ‘mini-crises’ since the 1960s in which the ‘mobility guarantees’ under-
pinning it began to look increasingly uncertain, if not threadbare, its ideological
and institutional resilience should not be underestimated. Dismantling, or even re-
forming, the credential system will remain a distant possibility if institutional and
organizational politics around current forms of ‘positional property’ continue to
favour the preservation of ‘educational barriers to entry’ – particularly for high
status/reward specialist occupations and the hierarchically stratified occupational
systems over which they preside.
Goodhart (2020) brings the critique of the meritocratic/credential system and
the technocratic ideology legitimating it right up to date in his historical analysis
of the ‘rise of the cognitive class’ and the various ways in which it has come to es-
tablish political and cultural domination over both education and work in post-in-
dustrial societies. He distinguishes ‘meritocratic selection systems’ and ‘meritocrat-
ic societies’ on the basis of technical/practical necessity as opposed to political/
social division; while the former is a functional necessity in any post-industrial po-
litical economy, the latter remains a major source of stratified inequality in that it
systemically and amorally excludes the majority of citizens from effective partici-
pation in the decision-making arenas that determine their, and their offspring’s,
life chances. Effectively managing the endemic tension between technocratically-
driven ‘inequality of esteem’ and democratically driven ‘equality of esteem’ or be-
tween ‘economic inequality’ and ‘political equality’ is the fundamental problem for
all post-industrial societies.
162
Chapter 7: Expert Futures

Identifying three types of work in post-industrial societies – ‘head work’, ‘hand
work’ and ‘heart work’ – Goodhart (2020) explores the structural mechanisms
and socio-historical processes through which ‘head work’ – in which specialized
knowledge and cognitive skills are valorised as being more functionally critical
and culturally prestigious than craft skills or emotional intelligence – has come
to dominate political debate and the policies followed by successive governments.
Nevertheless, recent social and economic trends clearly indicate that ‘hand’ and
‘heart’ work are becoming more necessary and relevant as revealed during the
Covid-19 crisis and our increasing collective reliance on ‘key workers’ who often
lack the meritocratic credentials prioritized by the professional classes and
other expert elites who have shaped social and political debates in recent years.
His analysis of ‘the rise of the cognitive class’, and the mechanisms through
which it’s social reproduced, assigns explanatory primacy to the complex ways
in which educational and occupational stratification became closely aligned in
all industrial societies from the mid-nineteenth century onwards and how the lat-
ter became institutionally and culturally embedded in post-industrial societies dur-
ing the twentieth century. He recognizes that the ‘respective roles of professional
associations, universities and the state in certifying membership of the cognitive
class played out differently in different countries’ (Goodhart 2020: 38). But the un-
derlying dynamic and the trajectory it generated institutionalized the power and
authority of scientific knowledge and cognitive skills over experiential knowledge
and practical skills to the detriment of wide-ranging abilities, capacities, and tal-
ents which could not or would not conform to the epistemological and technical
hierarchies which the former imposed. The emergence of post-industrial political
economies and societies in the latter half of the twentieth century structurally re-
inforced the changes which had produced ‘the cognitive class’, to the extent that
they ‘hollowed out’ labour markets based on ‘hand’ and ‘heart’ work while but-
tressing the elite status of ‘knowledge work’ and those qualified and smart enough
to do it. By depoliticizing technocratic rule in ways which seemed to make demo-
cratic politics redundant, political elites were disengaging or withdrawing from the
‘rough and tumble’ of everyday political life and turning governing over to a pro-
fessional/expert elite who weren’t subjected to the usual checks and balances asso-
ciated with representative democracy (Mair 2013: 96–98).
Yet, Goodhart (2020: Part 4) argues that the political tide has begun to turn de-
cisively against this meritocratic-technocratic ideology and politics as its inherent
limitations and failings become more and more apparent under the combined
pressures of widespread socio-economic dislocation and cultural alienation gener-
ated by digitalized Taylorism and the rise of populism. While these developments
are extremely distressing and uncomfortable for many, they provide a much
more favourable socio-political context for the recalibration of ‘head’, ‘hand’
2 Meritocracy Recrudescent
163

and ‘heart’ work so that much broader, more inclusive and participative concep-
tions of ‘knowledge’ and ‘skill’ come to frame contemporary debates over the fu-
ture of work in twenty-first century post-industrial societies. Only this way can
the ‘institutional stranglehold’ of meritocratic credentialism and the technocratic
ideology and politics that legitimated it be broken.
Although meritocratic credentialism has taken a lot of ‘critical fire’ in recent
times, there are those who are more than prepared to defend it – both as a ruling
ideology and a dominant regulative practice. Wooldridge (2021: 16) offers a defence
of meritocracy as a global, even ‘ruling’, ideology which has shaped the organiza-
tion of modern society since the nineteenth century in relation to its status as a
‘protean idea’ ‘allowing people to rise as high as their talents will take them’. He
distinguishes between different forms of meritocracy – ‘political’, ‘economic’, ‘tech-
nocratic’ and ‘academic’ – but insists they are all equally open to ‘self-correction’ in
that they can prevent themselves from degenerating into closed and self-perpetu-
ating elites through moderating counter measures based on regulation, competi-
tion and legislation. Indeed, he maintains that this is exactly what is happening
currently in that the danger of the meritocratic elite ‘hardening into an aristocracy
which passes on its privileges to its children by investing heavily in education, and
which, because of its sustained success, looks down on the rest of society’ (Wool-
dridge 2021: 17) is being counteracted by increased emphasis on market incentives,
selective state financial support, targeted affirmative action, upgrading vocational
education, and ‘re-moralizing the meritocratic ideal’ so that governing elites are
reminded of their continuing responsibility to maintain merit-based accessibility.
In this way, he concludes, the only viable mechanism for re-establishing the integ-
rity of meritocracy as a universal principle of educational stratification, occupa-
tional allocation, and social mobility is to overhaul and reset ‘the meritocratic ma-
chine’ by making it function properly according to its founding principles and
ensuring it remains responsive to wider political and social concerns over its in-
nate tendency to degenerate into a domination structure protecting the self-inter-
ests of a self-perpetuating elite. Meritocratic renewal is a necessary precondition
for meritocratic survival, and the former can only be realized if the ‘machine’s’ in-
nate failings are fully recognized and dealt with through corrective action that re-
stores its moral virtues against populist, communitarian and libertarian critiques.
Thus, his call for both a ‘better’ and ‘wiser’ meritocracy is intended to revivify the
credentials of meritocracy as the primary organizing principle for rewarding tal-
ent and achievement in which ‘the “winners” of the meritocratic competition have
much more of a sense of responsibility to the wider society – and that the “losers”
have alternative paths to dignity and self-fulfilment’ (Wooldridge 2021: 376).
In much the same vein as Wooldridge (2021) offers a defence of a meritocracy
as a ruling ideology, legitimating the organization and governance of a competitive

struggle to reach the top in which genuine ‘talent’ can succeed – even if with a re-
newed sense of ‘noblesse obliges’ suited to modern conditions – Kirkpatrick et al.
(2021) develop a parallel case for credentialism as providing a resilient and adap-
tive ‘regulatory ecology’ grounded in formal rationality and procedural fairness.
They insist that the ‘certification ecosystem’ on which professionalized modes of
occupational regulation continue to depend has been sufficiently robust and effec-
tive – at least in the US and by empirical extension in other advanced political
economies as well – to minimize the inroads made by neo-liberalization into its
capacity to generate and sustain labour market shelters for occupational groups
claiming a significant degree of autonomy in and control over their work perfor-
mance. Thus, they see the continued combined strength of professional association
formation, voluntary certification programmes and occupational licensing, sup-
ported by the state and other key stakeholders, as providing robust evidence for
the continuation of a dominant pattern of expert occupational regulation in
which formalized, legal and quasi-legal, credentialism plays the central role.
They explain the continuing resilience of ‘certification credentialism’ in terms
of a complex interaction between a range of variables including path-dependency,
institutional inertia, stakeholder self-interests and, echoing Wooldridge’s (2021)
analysis, the turn towards ‘home grown talent’ and the collective investment in en-
hanced skills training and professional development which it requires. However,
they ultimately turn to a combination of ‘historical legacy and switching costs’
as providing an overall explanation for the continued power of occupational cre-
dentialism and the authority it bestows on occupational groups relying on special-
ist expertise as their primary route to jurisdictional closure and the material and
symbolic rewards it conveys and protects. Neo-liberalization may have severely
weakened trade unionism and collective bargaining but professional regulation,
embedded within a certification ecosystem that continues to support the latter’s
legitimacy and efficacy, has, at least so far, proved to be a ‘much tougher nut for
it to crack’!
In previous discussion we have argued that Kirkpatrick at al. (2021) have a
very limited, not to say restricted, analytical focus on professional/expert regula-
tive authorization in relation to its formal accreditation and functional adaptation;
any interest in the substantive rationality on which the latter depends – that is, its
core values, symbols, rituals and routines – is conspicuous by its absence. However,
even if we were to take their, and Wooldridge’s, defence of meritocratic credenti-
alism at face value, another fundamental problem remains – both analyses only
provide support for what Turner (2014: 7–10) characterizes as a ‘process-based
legitimacy’ which leaves untouched the substantive, ‘output-based legitimacy’ is-
sues around which most of the controversy has raged in recent years. A defence of
meritocratic credentialism relying primarily on a functional or procedural ration-
2 Meritocracy Recrudescent
165

ality – in which bureaucratic structures and systems are relied on to absorb
‘trust‐based’ legitimacy controversies by neutralizing them through administrative
norms and rules technically guaranteeing procedural equity – is unlikely to prove
that effective when, for ‘users of expert claims, including experts themselves, there
are issues of trust [relating to] what is called output legitimacy as distinct from
process legitimacy’ (Turner 2014: 9). ‘Output legitimacy’ essentially revolves around
doubts and uncertainties which users and other experts articulate concerning the
specialist knowledge and skills that ‘these experts’ are assumed to hold and deploy
when dealing with the vast array of problems which they are expected to solve.
Diplomas, certificates, rules and regulations may provide some solace in the face
of ‘process legitimacy’ challenges but they are much less likely to prove sufficiently
reassuring when ‘output legitimacy’ controversies concerning the innate trust-
worthiness of expert claims and the interventions they authorize are increasing
in magnitude and intensity. Credentialism is not a functional substitute for trust-
based ‘outcome legitimacy’.
Indeed, the technocratic disguise which meritocratic credentialism often
cloaks itself in can prove to be much more receptive to ‘going into partnership’
with those ideological systems and political movements, such as populism and neo-
liberalism, which have been most virulently hostile and condemnatory in relation
to the former’s credibility and viability. We consider the implications of the emer-
gence of these ideological-cum-political hybrids for the legitimation of expert au-
thority in the following section.
3 Technopopulism
Bickerton and Accetti (2021) provide the most theoretically well-developed analy-
sis of ‘technopopulism’, but it is anticipated in earlier publications such as Hurt
and Lipschutz (2016), Davies (2018), Callison and Manfredi (2020) and Vormann
and Weinman (2021). All these texts identify the emergence of hybrid ideological
formations and political movements which have made significant impacts on the
organization and conduct of legitimacy struggles around power, authority and sta-
tus in contemporary political economies and societies over the last decade or so.
These hybrid formations and movements are also seen to have major implications
for the range and diversity of the legitimation strategies through which political
and expert elites have come together in various networks and coalitions in
order to defend or enhance their ‘hard’ and ‘soft’ power resources in the face of
increasing economic and political instability. In this respect, they seem to generate
a very different political, social and cultural context in which experts, both collec-
tively and individually, must navigate with instrumentation which has to be thor-

oughly recalibrated in order ‘to get them through’ the much more threatening con-
ditions they must cope with now and in the future.
We have briefly discussed Bickerton and Accetti’s (2021) book in a previous
chapter, but we now need to consider their analysis in a little more depth as we
attempt to develop a scenario of an expert future which stands in stark contrast
to the somewhat complacent, if not myopic, scenario of ‘refurbish and reset’ out-
lined in the previous section. For Bickerton and Accetti (2021), ‘technopopulism’ is
an organizing logic followed by political parties seeking electoral success in repre-
sentative democracies in which technocratic and populist discursive topes and po-
litical organizations are combined to form more inclusive electoral strategies en-
compassing a wide range of economic, political and social interests. Although it
can take different forms, technopopulism is a strategy which claims to represent
‘the people’ as a whole and to deploy ‘expertise’ in the furtherance of their collec-
tive values and interests as a unified community in a highly fragmented and fis-
sured world. Rather than replacing more conventional and established political
logics, it superimposes itself on them from above and below through a combination
of tactics encompassing elite-led takeover and follower-led entryism in which so-
cial media and digital technologies play a pivotal role.
As technopopulism becomes more evident across a range of European and
North American representative democracies, so its medium and long-term implica-
tions for expert power and authority grow in significance and scale. Increasingly,
expert occupational groups and their representative organizations find themselves
drawn into an ideological embrace and political movement in which they are
tied in much more explicitly and closely into ‘projects’ and ‘causes’, rather than
‘policies’ and ‘issues’, dominated by ‘techniques of theatre and spectacle’ (Bicker-
ton and Accetti 2021: 148–153). Rather than providing objective technical advice
based on rigorous research and analysis, experts find themselves now operating
and mediating between governing elites and the electorate as they ‘sell’ the latter’s
‘offerings’ to an increasingly divided and sceptical public. They are no longer seen,
or can expect to be seen, as the carriers of independent specialist expertise and the
autonomous role it once played in the formulation and implementation of ‘policy’.
Instead, they metamorphosize into technocratic fixers whose very existence, much
less status, depends on their usefulness to governing elites always on the lookout
for ‘manufactured consent’ in a world of rapidly shifting alliances and deals.
In this extremely unstable and uncertain world, the unwritten social contract
on which the institutionalized trust between states, experts, and publics once de-
pended upon to legitimate expert authority can no longer provide the surety and
stability it previously delivered. Its vulnerabilities and limitations have become
increasingly exposed to more extreme ideologies, organizations and movements
in which a political discourse of tolerance and compromise has given way to
3 Technopopulism
167

one dominated by the discursive tropes of conflict, division, and mistrust. Techno-
populism provides a logic and mode of political representation in which the latter
can be subsumed and dissolved within a more encompassing unitary ideology and
discourse in which reconciliation between ‘trust’ and ‘control’ becomes possible
without recourse to conventional liberal democratic politics and all the messy com-
promises on which it relies for its legitimacy and viability. Technocratic and pop-
ulist discourses merge in a hybridized melange of political ideology and practice in
which collective differences are translated into ‘individual problems’ that require
technical solutions through a depoliticized management of public affairs overrid-
ing sectional interests represented through party-based organizations and opposi-
tional social movements (Bickerton and Accetti 2021: 178–180).
However successful a technopopulist logic and strategy may have been in re-
cent years – as exemplified in the New Labour triumphs of the late 1990s and
early/mid noughties, the Tory landslide in the 2019 election, Trump’s successful
presidential campaign in 2016 or Macron’s election to the French presidency in
2017– constituted as a recombinant ideological and political hybrid, it must absorb
and contain some very significant internal tensions and pressures. At its core, tech-
nocracy is a politics based on ‘truth’ as generated and confirmed through some sort
of independent epistemic process and its supporting ‘knowledge-producing institu-
tions’ such that those experts who speak in the name of ‘science’ or ‘medicine’ or
‘profession’ do so with the legitimate authority conferred by the former. Their ‘epis-
temic authority’ is generated and validated through processes and procedures by
means of which the highly esoteric and specialized knowledge they possess and
profess is legitimated so that it comes with a ‘gold ticket’ guarantee of its independ-
ence, objectivity and relevance. Populism, on the other hand, trumps (no pun in-
tended!) ‘truth’ with an appeal to ‘popular sovereignty’ in which expert authority
must be subjected to the collective will and priorities of ‘the people’ as refracted
through populist movements and their leadership and the political parties and
elites which emerge from the latter. Its political elites and media cheerleaders
are assumed to have a ‘direct line’ to what the people want and how they want
it, unencumbered by the conventional trappings of expert knowledge and all the
confusion and uncertainty which its prevarications and qualifications sow.
Consequently, ways need to be found to soften these differences, take the ideo-
logical and political edge out of them in ways that ensure a transition into power
and modes of governance effectively containing what residual internal tensions
and pressures remain. Here again, experts play a central role in discursively
‘smoothing over’ and organizationally ‘co-opting’ potential recalcitrant interest
groups and movements into a wider configuration of political representation with-
in which their voices and concerns can find some expression and articulation.
They become the ‘bridge builders’ and supporting maintenance crew whereby in-
168
Chapter 7: Expert Futures

ternal ideological contradictions and policy differences can be translated into
more neutral, inclusive discourses emphasizing the ‘non-political’ character of
what the party or movement, particularly when it comes into power, wants to ach-
ieve and how it will go about achieving it.
Yet, ‘the attempt to use as a political resource a form of legitimacy – expertise
– usually legitimized by precisely its non-political character certainly has limits’
(Bickerton and Accetti 2021: 198 emphases in original). As we have already seen
in chapter five of this book on the Covid-19 crisis, these limits are very likely to be-
come even more apparent and stressed under the pressures generated by the latter
when high-risk, high-pressure decision-making situations become a routine socio-
political reality in which the reconciliation between ‘expertise’ and ‘popular will’
becomes extremely difficult – if not impossible – to pull off. By reshaping the dis-
cursive frame and political means through which contemporary democratic poli-
tics is conducted, technopopulism may be rather more effective as a logic and strat-
egy for gaining power than it is for exercising power once governmental office is
secures. Once in office, a technocratic governing strategy based on discursively le-
gitimated expert authority and politically sanctioned administrative interventions
threatens to push populist ideology and leadership on to the margins of power and
to exacerbate all sorts of pre-existing internal tensions and conflicts as a result.
Various initiatives may be undertaken to moderate the latter’s impact on the gov-
erning regime’s practices and popularity – such as setting up specialized units of
experts enabling technologically-driven governing at the administrative core of
the government machine – but these debilitating tensions and conflicts are likely
to continue to haunt governments whose paths to power depended on powerful
emotional appeals to cultural identity, popular sovereignty, and national exception-
alism. Although more ‘pure’ forms of technopolitics – such as that practiced under
Blair’s New Labour administrations in the UK between the late nineties and mid-
twenties – are unlikely to experience these problems with the same severity as
they better integrate technocracy and populism, all governing regimes following
such a political logic and strategy will be exposed to the endemic tensions between
the latter.
One way out of this post-election impasse for technopopulist governing re-
gimes may lie in the direction of importing selected elements of the ‘neoliberal
playbook’ into the strategic mix of policies and practices which they develop
when coming under sustained external political pressure. Hence, the repeated ten-
dency for most administrations pursuing a technopopulist strategy to fall back on
‘managerial politics’ subjecting government policy making and practice to private
sector cloned methodologies and technologies in which market competition, bench-
marking performance targets and corporate surveillance play an increasingly im-
portant role. In an American rather than European context, Peck and Theodore
3 Technopopulism
169

(2015: 5) refer to the ‘mobilities of neoliberal governmentality’ in which ‘fast poli-
cies’ based on ‘hybrid mutations of policy techniques and practices across dynamic
institutional landscapes’ emerge and become discursively legitimated through an
ideologically promiscuous mix of technocracy, populism, and neoliberalism in
which adaptability, flexibility and ‘realism’ are the dominant themes. However,
this tactic entails a significant shift in the locus of authority over policy making
and implementation which risks ‘re-politicizing’ expertise as it becomes re-em-
broiled within disputes over ‘the role of expert and technocratic networks,
many of which have been instrumental in the propagation of neoliberal reason,
practice and rule’ (Peck and Theodore 2015: 24). This is likely to increasingly jar
against populist sentiment, ever suspicious of elitist technocratic rationalism
and its marked preference for globalized policy paradigms over localized senti-
ments and geographies (Kennedy 2016).
Thus, the structural and ideological fault lines characteristic of technopopulist
parties and movements, once they get into power, are almost certain to become
more pronounced and destabilizing as they struggle with the realities of governing
with a political/policy paradigm in which expert authority is simultaneously laud-
ed and despised. Their dependence on experts and their expertise is a ‘truth which
cannot speak its name’ because to do so would reveal how they cannot dispense
with them and their knowledge in a highly complex and extremely uncertain
world. On the other hand, the more populism and neoliberalism re-politicize’ ex-
pert knowledge and skill, the more damaging this can become for claims which at-
tempt to legitimate the latter based on their disinterested objectivity and techno-
cratic acumen. In this respect, technopopulist politics presents very real dangers
as well as rewards for experts and their claims to epistemological authority and
technical control; right-wing populist parties/movements and their leaders remain
hostile to professional and technocratic elites no matter how much they might
need them – particularly in crisis situations when their expertise is desperately
required to shore-up decisions often made on ‘political’ rather than ‘technical’
grounds. Indeed, the more power and influence which experts inevitably accrue
in crisis situations will be greeted by right wing populists and libertarians alike
with unrestrained suspicion and derision as, for them, it smacks of a return to
the social democratic ‘statism’ which they abhor and detest (Reed 2022).
Overall, the technopopulist scenario is, at best, a ‘mixed-bag’ for expert author-
ity in that it promises a degree of recognition as a legitimate element of the gov-
ernmental regimes and policy paradigms it’s likely to generate but this remains
highly conditional on the understanding that experts continue ‘to know their
place’ in established power hierarchies. It certainly doesn’t hold out any realistic
promise or prospect of a return to the heady days of ‘institutionalized trust’
170
Chapter 7: Expert Futures

when experts could realistically count on the support of both state elites and gen-
eral publics for their claims to authority and status.
In the next section of this chapter, we turn to consider a third scenario in
which the return of institutionalized trust may be regarded as a realistic possibility
– that is, the emergence of a new form of ‘civic’ or ‘connective’ professionalism.
4 Civic/Connective Professionalism
Within the technopopulist scenario, experts are seen as critical mediators and
brokers between the technocratic and populist wings of the political logic and
strategy on which the former depends for its ideological and electoral appeal. How-
ever, once in government, parties and movements which have successfully fol-
lowed this political logic and strategy in their ‘ascent to power’ find it increasingly
difficult to accommodate expert authority. Those who claim it are often seen,
especially by committed populists, to exceed their allotted role and status as ‘tech-
nical advisers’ or ‘political fixers’ in their aspirations to shape, if not direct, the
policies and programmes which technopopulist governments are wanting to ini-
tiate and develop. This tension between ‘technocrats’ and ‘populists’ is exacerbated
if those expert groups attempting to achieve much greater influence over govern-
mental strategy and policy come to be seen as ‘professional elites’ who threaten to
wrench strategic control from those leadership groups regarded as the ‘carriers of
the populist flame’. Expert authority is an endemic source of tension and conflict
within the technopopulist scenario because it constantly threatens the ‘meritocrat-
ic recrudescence’ so despised by populist leaders and followers committed to its
demise. For them, ‘professionalism’, in whatever form or guise it appears, is to
be regarded as an enemy to be defeated because it has become the major source
and expression of the present-day elitism which populists must eradicate if popu-
lar sovereignty is to be regained and protected.
However, this scenario singularly fails to consider the possibility that ‘profes-
sionalism’ may mutate into an institutional form and practice which can accom-
modate a broader range of interests and values in connecting much more mean-
ingfully to the wider civil societies and communities in which professions are
embedded. This possibility leads us to the third scenario we consider in this sec-
tion – the emergence and potential of ‘civic’ or ‘connective professionalism’
which seeks to rejuvenate selected elements of the institutionalized trust relation-
ship so badly damaged by recent economic, political and cultural transformations.
In a series of publications, Clarke and Newman (1997, 2005, 2007) have identi-
fied the potentialities for the emergence of a ‘civic professionalism’ in UK public
services as they respond to the imposition of market-based, consumerist policies
4 Civic/Connective Professionalism
171

and practices associated with various ‘waves’ or ‘phases’ of New Public Manage-
ment (Reed 2019). They trace a long-term developmental process whereby ‘bu-
reau-professional’ governance regimes – in which public service professionals
must adapt to new modes of managerial control unsympathetic to established
norms and practices of professional autonomy and self-regulation – eventually
give way to more open and flexible forms of ‘stakeholder governance’ in which
‘citizen consumers’ demand more accessibility and accountability from managers
and experts alike. Thus, their book ‘Creating Citizen Consumers’ (2007) identifies a
paradigm shift from a ‘bureau-professional’ governance regime based on a tripar-
tite ‘economic/political, social and organizational settlement’ in which managerial-
ism and professionalism accommodated each other in an inherently uneasy and
unstable ideological and institutional compromise to a more reflexive ‘consumer-
ist-citizenship’ governance regime. Within the latter, ‘the problem of how to man-
age diverse, differentiated and mobile populations [who] are also “reflexive” and
becoming detached from previous forms of authority, identity, identification and
attachment’ (Clarke at al. 2007: 23) emerges as the key strategic issue for successive
New Labour regimes responding to increasing public scepticism and cynicism over
public services organized and managed by remote technocratic and professional
elites.
Subsequently, the book analyses the rise of the concept of the ‘citizen-consum-
er’ in which both major UK political parties became ideologically and organization-
ally committed to bringing a consumerist culture much more prominently into the
provision and evaluation of public services. Although they differed considerably in
the policy strategies and organizational mechanisms through which the latter was
to be realized – internal/manged markets and performance targets as opposed to
marketization and outsourcing – both major UK political parties agreed that ‘users/
consumers’ needed to be at the centre of a consumer-centred model of public serv-
ices in which ‘choice’, ‘equity’ and ‘quality’ were to be the new priorities. As Clarke
et al. (2007) note, the populist undertones of this paradigm shift from ‘bureau-pro-
fessionalism’ to ‘citizen-consumer’ were never very far from the surface as the in-
creasing prominence of a consumerist culture across the ideological/political spec-
trum gave voice to representations of government in which popular sovereignty
assumed priority over vested interests and elite control. Hence, the ‘authority of
the consumer’ became conjoined to the ’needs of the citizen’ within policy hybrids
that attempted to rework existing networks of ideas in which individual choice
and collective security could be selectively recombined to form new, innovative
‘programmes and projects’ focused around reconciling the competing demands
of providers and publics within marketized service sectors. Various ‘evaluation
methodologies’, such as ‘best value inspection audits’ in local government (Miller
2005), were developed and utilized to assess the extent to which individual service
172
Chapter 7: Expert Futures

consumers’ needs and interests were being properly represented, either materially
or virtually, in these new programmes and projects in which ‘network governance’
systems were meant to replace professionally dominated ‘hierarchical gover-
nance’.
These developments have major implications for public service professional-
ism to the extent that they call for a radical overhaul of the occupational-organiza-
tional formations in which public service professionals operate and through which
they legitimate their authority and status as ‘expert staff ’ who play a central role
in shaping the strategic direction which their services will follow. Empowering ‘the
citizen-consumer’ under the dispensation of a new policy and governance para-
digm in which users, patients, customers, and voters – rather than politicians,
professionals, managers, and technocrats – become the new source of primary le-
gitimate authority, as articulated through their choices as consumers and their
votes as citizens, becomes highly problematic for established service professionals
as they scramble to adapt to a changed world in which they are no longer at the
epicentre of its movement and trajectory. As Clarke et al. (2007) document in some
empirical detail, service sectors and the organizations which populate them be-
come sites of increasing strain and tension between the various stakeholders
who are meant to make ‘the citizen-consumer’ paradigm work at the level of policy
implementation and service delivery. It is here that the old and the new paradigms
clash most transparently and where service professionals are expected to ‘keep the
wheels turning’ in health trusts, local government authorities, police authorities,
school chains and a myriad of devolved agencies. Various organizational innova-
tions such as ‘expert patients’ or ‘responsible health users’ are serially tried and
dispensed with as they run up against the realities of widening disparities in
the range and quality of provision and the continuing impact of power inequalities
on the allocation and distribution of scarce resources.
Yet, it’s the service professionals who must embrace the operational outcomes
which the ‘citizen-consumer’ paradigm generates by opening themselves up to the
challenges it presents and adapting their occupational cultures and organizational
practices to a consumerist ethic and civic responsiveness to new laws and regula-
tions enshrining individual and collective rights to services. In place of a policy/
governance paradigm in which experts and managers are always expected, and
even deferentially trusted, ‘to know best’, they must now regain legitimate author-
ity in situations where the dependency relationships between providers/professio-
nals and users/clients seem to have been permanently rebalanced in favour of the
latter. Hierarchically organized professional knowledge and the authority it auto-
matically bestows on those formally responsible for its deployment has given
way to horizontally distributed expertise and the much more inclusive civic net-
works of relationships and demands within which it has become enmeshed. Meet-

ing and managing an often bewilderingly complex spectrum of needs and expect-
ations has become ‘the norm’ for public service professionals and managers as
they struggle ‘to make the hybrid happen’ (Reed and Wallace 2015).
Indeed, Newman (2013) argues that, by the time a coalition government comes
into power in the UK in 2010, the shift from hierarchical to network governance is
well-advanced enough to ensure that a more open, adaptable and inclusive form of
public service professionalism is here to stay. Professionals have always held a
somewhat ambiguous position within public services in that neoliberal-led ‘mar-
ketization’ and ‘managerialism’ has become so organizationally pervasive in the
UK and the US it has severely weakened whatever occupationally based resistance
expert groups might have mounted in their defence. Nevertheless, she also identi-
fies significant institutional spaces and organizational enclaves in which they cre-
ate and sustain new forms of agency such as ‘professional social entrepreneurs’ or
‘personal advocacy groups’ which gives them much greater control over their work
and the ways in which it is evaluated. In turn, this is likely to make more establish-
ed, even ‘small c-conservative’, professions more aware of the need, indeed imper-
ative, to connect-up with wider civic interest agencies and movements, while devel-
oping the new communicative, promotional and political skills required in this
‘brave new world of the citizen consumer’. Even though professional and other
expert jurisdictional boundaries still prevail and make a positive contribution to
getting work done under pressure and with high quality care and outcomes (Currie
and White 2012; Currie et al. 2012; Farchi, Dopson and Ferlie 2022), in the future
professional/expert legitimacy will have to dispense with the melange of defer-
ence, passivity and proceduralism characteristic of ‘bureau professionalism’. In
its place must come the recognition of radically transformed institutional, organ-
izational, and occupational realities in which professional/expert authority will
have to work much harder and more transparently to establish rather different
trust relationships based not on secrecy and dependency but on visibility and part-
nership.
Noordegraaf (2007, 2011a and b, 2013, 2020) tells a very similar story to that told
by Clarke and Newman but from a Northern European rather than Anglo-Ameri-
can perspective in which the influence and impact of neoliberalism and populism
have been much more muted and nuanced because of continuing governmental
and communal support for ‘professions and professionalism’ from both the state
and the public. His work has consistently demonstrated an awareness of the innate
potential of hybridized forms of professionalism to metamorphosize into a new
type of professional work organization that moves considerably beyond the estab-
lished or orthodox model of expert authority which we outlined in the first chapter
of this book. In particular, he has drawn attention to the multiplicity of pressures
and challenges impinging on contemporary professions as they struggle to adapt to
174
Chapter 7: Expert Futures

demographic shifts, high risk problems and rising public uncertainties that cor-
rode the structural foundations and cultural frameworks on which established
professionalism depended for its legitimacy and credibility. Indeed, he sees profes-
sional hybridization as a response to the manifold ways in which professional as-
sociations and work organizations are being forced to open-up to these ‘external-
ities’, and the internal restructurings and reconstructions which they require if
‘professionalism’ is to be able to sustain itself as a viable mode of expert work reg-
ulation in the future.
By selectively recombining elements of organizational logics and practices
drawn from a range of institutional forms – including managerialism, collegiality,
marketization, digitalization and communitarianism – professional hybridization
generates a change dynamic in which qualitatively different modes of profession-
alism based on inclusion and collaboration rather than exclusion and competition
become realistic possibilities (Kirkpatrick and Noordegraaf 2015). While internal
structural and cultural tensions will necessarily remain in whatever modes of pro-
fessionalism emerge from this change dynamic – between hierarchy and network,
control and autonomy, compliance and commitment – the latter can be seen as real
attempts ‘to move beyond established dualisms [and] seeking new ways to become
more organized to ensure legitimacy and sustainability’ (Kirkpatrick and Noorde-
graaf (2015: 103).
This, relatively optimistic, vision of what the future of professionalism, and ex-
pert authority more generally, might look like has been outlined in some detail in
Noordegraaf ’s (2020) theorization of ‘connective professionalism’ and the latter’s
capacity to repair much of the damage that has been wrought by growing social
and political distrust. He sees the latter as constituting an ideal type of profession-
alism entailing a distinctive move ‘beyond hybridization’ in that it embodies a
fundamental reconfiguration of the three core conceptual elements that define
‘what professions are’ – ‘expertise, ‘autonomy’, and ‘authority’. ‘Protective profes-
sionalism’ is configured around a series of ‘protective shields’ or defensive mech-
anisms simultaneously distancing and linking professional work to real world
situations by means of interlinked external labour market shelters and internal
workplace jurisdictional controls enabling professions to remain essentially in-
ward-looking, self-regulating and self-reproducing expert occupational cartels.
However, this form of professionalism has come under extreme pressure in recent
years from the accumulated impact of economic, technological, political and cultur-
al changes undermining its internal cohesion and external viability to the extent
that it has been forced to adapt to the threats and challenges which the latter
pose. Hence, the emergence and momentum of various hybridizing strategies in
which competing organizational logics and practices – such as ‘managerialism’
and ‘professionalism’ or ‘bureaucratization’ and ‘marketization’ or ‘hierarchy’
4 Civic/Connective Professionalism
175

and ‘network’ – are selectively recombined, both at the level of work organization
and roles, in ways that partially move the configuration of expertise, autonomy
and authority towards a more inclusive, collective, and collaborative mode of pro-
fessional action.
However, Noordegraaf (2020) argues that hybridizing adaptations simply don’t
move far enough away from the core components of the protective model because
they still retain significant residues or ‘leftovers’ from the latter as embodied in
the continuing commitment to professional epistemic exclusivity and jurisdiction-
al independence. Only the transition to full or complete ‘connective professional-
ism’ can realize the radical reconfiguration between expertise, autonomy, and au-
thority which the underlying logic and dynamic of contemporary environmental
transformation demands as it drives us towards a better understanding of profes-
sionalism as ‘an interactive, living phenomenon, taking shape in real-life processes,
situated in complex service ecologies, with multiple relations to stakeholders’
(Noordegraaf 2020: 2011 emphasis in original). Once we conceptually and empiri-
cally grasp the ontological status and significance of ‘professionalism’ as a living,
dynamic, relational entity – necessarily embedded in external ecologies indelibly
shaping its form and content – then, and only then, will we be in a position to ap-
preciate how ‘professionalism’ has to be enacted on a continuous basis through
various processes and mechanisms and able to answer the $64.000 question
‘how can connected professionals remain experts, autonomous and authoritative
in complex webs of relations?’ (Noordegraaf 2020: 2011).
Noordegraaf proves a relatively optimistic, upbeat and consensus-building
answer to this key question in his specification of an ideal type of ‘connective
professionalism’ in which ‘distributed/adaptive expertise’, ‘collaborative autonomy’
and ‘performative authority’ are linked together and enacted by means of proac-
tive, trust-building mechanisms ensuring much greater internal transparency
and external accountability shared between all stakeholders within this increas-
ingly complex and dynamic expert ecology. No longer the highly secretive, exclu-
sive and guild-like defences of traditional professionalism but the emergence of
a mode of professional action and organization in which ‘professional acts are
not performed by “professionals” but they are part of service processes, in
wider service ecologies, in which many actors and factors play a role; “profession-
alism”, in other words, is not so much made or produced by professionals them-
selves and then secured, it is largely “made” by others/outsiders when they interact
with professionals’ (Noordegraaf 2020: 219 emphasis in original).
While recognizing a role for agency, individual and collective, in shaping the
transition from ‘protective’ to ‘connective’ professionalism, Noordegraaf clearly
thinks that ‘history is on the side of the latter’ in that change in service ecologies
is seen to be driving change in service processes and forms within an overall tra-
176
Chapter 7: Expert Futures

jectory guaranteeing a successful transition to a more connected, inclusive, and
participative reconfiguration of professional/expert authority. Indeed, he sees
empirical indicators of the latter’s inevitability in a range of contemporary organ-
izational experiments such as ‘community judges’ and ‘multi-disciplinary medical
health teams’ and ‘impactful academics’ which exemplify many of the key features
of connective professionalism’s inherent capacity to move beyond more partial and
limited hybrid forms and to embrace the logic of ‘relational professionalism’ in all
its interactive complexity and high-risk visibility.
Putting to one side methodological reservations over Noordegraaf ’s use of
ideal types (Adams, Clegg, Eyal, Reed and Saks 2020), very real concerns remain
over the teleological/evolutionary logic which underpins his analysis of the transi-
tion from ‘protective’ to ‘connective’ professionalism. By choosing to emphasize the
long run determining impact of environmental or ecological change on occupation-
al or organizational change, Noordegraaf assumes that the inherent ‘divisiveness’,
‘messiness’, and ‘incompleteness’ of any change process is overridden by evolution-
ary dynamics and forces driving in the direction of higher-level adaptation and
growth. His ‘teleological optimism’ – that is, the belief that there is an evolutionary
logic underpinning history inevitably driving in the direction of better adapted and
integrated ecological systems – underwrites his analysis of the eventual triumph of
‘connective professionalism’ and the distinctive form of expert authority on which
it depends. It also illustrates the socio-political specificity and cultural relativity
of that analysis within a ‘continental/European’, as opposed to an ‘intercontinen-
tal/Anglo-Saxon’ theoretical tradition (Collins 1990; Kirkpatrick and Noordegraaf
2015), in which central states played a more explicit and directive role in professio-
nal development and formation. Within the former, key institutional actors such
as states, governments, and political parties are seen in much more benign,
even positive, terms insofar as they are consistently supportive of modes of profes-
sional development and formation embedded in wider collective and communal
mobility projects. Perhaps even more crucially, the unwritten, implicit social con-
tract which underpinned the trust-building processes and mechanisms between
states, experts, and publics in Anglo-Saxon political economies and welfare sys-
tems has been much more formalized, and legally and governmentally protected
in their European counterparts. Thus, the latter exhibited a much higher degree
of resilience and robustness in the face of economic, socio-political and technolog-
ical changes which threatened its cohesion and standing, while the former became
increasingly frayed and threadbare under the accumulative pressures exerted by
neoliberalism, populism, and digitalization.
In this respect, Noordegraaf ’s confidence in the eventual transition to ‘con-
nective professionalism’ may be much more historically, politically, and culturally
relative than his ‘teleological optimism’ permits. Try telling UK academics that ‘im-
4 Civic/Connective Professionalism
177

pactful academics’ may be seen as a contemporary empirical illustration of ‘con-
nective professionalism in action’ when the political agenda behind the former
has been driven by a decade or more of central state policy in relation to higher
education (and public services) reform strategies in which ‘corporatization’ and
‘managerialism’ have been, and remain, the dominant change ideologies imposed
on public service professionals (Reed 2019; Wallace et al. 2022). Also, Noordegraaf ’s
analytical commitment to an evolutionary, rather than historical, institutionalism
(Campbell and Pedersen 2001; Thornton, Ocasio and Lounsbury 2012) means that
he sees change, necessarily, as a linear movement towards more socially and nor-
matively progressive social forms across a wide range of institutional fields. This
linear/progressive analytical focus marginalizes, if not excludes, the possibility of
a backward or return movement towards more regressive social forms because
the ‘direction of travel’ logically built-into evolutionary institutionalism rules out
the possibility of any cyclical dynamic reversing the trajectory towards higher lev-
els of ‘managed complexity’. As Hay 2001: 199) has argued, under evolutionary in-
stitutionalism, ‘the process of policy evolution then tends to be characterized by
successive stages or iterations of strategic learning within the broad parameters
of an evolving paradigm’ where crises lead to policy and practice transformations
in which established configurations are succeeded by new ones extirpating any
residual elements of the latter. In this respect, Noordegraaf ’s evolutionary logic
of ‘protective – hybrid – connective’ configurations of professionalism underplay,
if not ignore, the power struggles within and between economic/political elites,
expert groups and publics which shape both the trajectory of change and the out-
comes that it generates in terms of the ever-shifting ‘trust/control dynamic’ be-
tween these key institutional actors (Reed 2018). Instead, we are expected to accept
the underlying explanatory logic and methodological protocols of a form of anal-
ysis in which a unidirectional movement towards a more democratically advanced
and organizationally complex form of professionalism will necessarily be secured
because it is implicit in the evolutionary mechanisms and ecological processes
which determine the developmental path it must follow. If history is on our
side, then there’s no need to worry too much about the modes of collective and
individual agency whereby it might be brought, however contingently, untidily
and ambiguously, into existence. Yet, Keynes’ salutary reminder that ‘in the long
run we are all dead’ suggests that the historical possibilities and options are
much broader and contested than evolutionary institutionalists might suggest.
As such, it also reminds us of ‘the elephant in the room’ with evolutionary in-
stitutionalist analyses of the ‘rise and rise of civic/connective professionalism’ –
that is the inescapable reality of the fact that ‘expertise necessarily involves in-
equality’ (Moore 2017: 6) insofar as it constitutes ‘a social relation among unequals,
which depends on recognition by a given audience’ because ‘experts claim to pos-
178
Chapter 7: Expert Futures

sess knowledge, skills, information and experience that others do not’. Noorde-
graaf too easily assumes that a move towards more relational forms of expertise
necessarily entails a progressive shift in the direction of more open, inclusive and
connected professionalism, whereas the actual ‘historical out turn’ is likely to be
much more contested, contradictory, and ambiguous than his analysis suggests.
5 Critical Elitism
Our fourth and final scenario for ‘expert futures’ rejects the teleological optimism
underlying the evolutionary institutionalism which seems to have become so intel-
lectually influential, if not dominant (Reed and Burrell 2018), within mainstream
sociology of organizations/professions over the last decade or so. It begins with
the reality that relational expertise is necessarily embedded within a structure
of power relations based on inequality of access to and control over scarce and val-
uable resources such as knowledge, skill and experience which must be legitimat-
ed if it is to be established and recognized as ‘epistemic authority’ (Moore 2017:
8–9). Although the innate risks to democratic accountability and control posed
by the latter can be mitigated in various ways, epistemic authority is anchored
in configurations of power relations that cannot be ‘wished away’ however inclu-
sive, connected and deliberative they may become in certain circumstances (Eyal
2019). Expertise, if it is to remain ‘authoritative’, can never become fully ‘democrat-
ic’ in the sense of being constituted by and subject to the rule of others who are
unable to sustain any legitimate claims to the epistemic knowledge on which its
authority is based. This does not mean that expert authority is beyond contestation
and challenge, quite the reverse, but it does entail acceptance of the reality that
the former needs to be protected from becoming ‘politicized’ in the way which
it has under neoliberal libertarianism and populist authoritarianism. As Eyal
(2019: 30–36) argues, ‘expertise’ entails a capacity to perform specialized tasks
which cannot be carried out in its absence or are more ineffectively and ineffi-
ciently carried out without its presence; in turn, experts organize themselves in
corporate groups to exercise control over the knowledge which effective special-
ized task performance requires and to ensure appropriate standards against
which the latter can be judged. Neither of these will work if they are to be routine-
ly subjected to public vote or other forms of formal, external intervention based on
a political logic in which ideology or popularity are the overriding considerations.
There is a structural contradiction and systemic tension between ‘expertise’
and ‘democracy’ which must be factored into any set of proposals relating to
how epistemic authority and those claiming it are to be scrutinized and made ac-
countable to a set of values and priorities ranging beyond their immediate jurisdic-
5 Critical Elitism
179

tional domains. If the ‘golden era’ image or vision of experts as ‘objective empiri-
cists’ or ‘technical nerds’ can no longer be sustained under the combined pressures
we have examined in this book, this does not mean to say that the endemic ten-
sions between ‘expert autonomy’ and ‘democratic control’ have simply withered
away. As Rosenfeld (2019: 89–91) insists, ‘technocratic expertise can threaten the
basic values of equality, pluralism, and shared decision-making on which democ-
racy is meant to stand … if technocracy attached to global capitalism has increas-
ingly threatened to overpower the idea of cooperative democratic decision … the
reaction, with its characteristic anger and know-nothingness, has started to consti-
tute its own form of risk’.
Building on the ‘deliberative democracy’ tradition we outlined in the previous
chapter of this book, Moore (2017) develops his model of ‘critical elitism’ as a pos-
itive response to the crisis in expert authority in which expertise has been politi-
cized and politics depoliticized as they both become caught in the crosshair of au-
thoritarian populism and technocratic egalitarianism. For him, the fundamental
problem ‘is how to conceptualize and construct expert authority in a context of
widespread public capacities to challenge and contest it’ (Moore 2017: 4). Rising
public scepticism and questioning of expert authority, reinforced by various polit-
ical movements determined to take advantage of this situation and the increas-
ing economic inequality that capitalist-led technocracy has generated, have pro-
duced a series of ‘legitimation crises’ which show no signs of abating even in
the face of various policy responses and initiatives from governments, businesses
and other key institutional actors such as universities. ‘Expertise’ is increasingly
viewed as a major source of unaccountable power which must be ‘democratized’
if it is to be transformed into a legitimate form of authority subject to collective
supervision and control by independent institutions and movements beyond its
purview and influence.
In opposition to strategies for re-legitimating expert authority demanding its
‘democratization’, Moore’s (2017: 6 emphases in original) offers his model of ‘crit-
ical elitism’ ‘as a framework for understanding the ways in which expertise is not
in itself democratic but can be integrated into a wider democratic system’. In this
way, ‘critical elitism’ is based on three, interrelated core assumptions: first, that ex-
pertise necessarily involves inequality because it is integral to a complex web of so-
cial relations necessarily entailing variable degrees of dependency on the part of
those needing it; second, that some degree of exclusion and passivity on the part
of the latter are also necessary because complete or total ‘public inclusion and par-
ticipation’ in expert decision-making would compromise its independence and
effectiveness (Collins and Evans 2009); third, that expertise must be deliberatively
constituted if it is ‘not to be construed in terms of blind deference … in order to
be effective, claims need to be accepted as authoritative; it is vital that over time
180
Chapter 7: Expert Futures

and across institutions there are live possibilities for contestation and challenge’
(Moore 2017: 8).
This model of expert authority as combining both epistemological elitism and
public scrutiny is subsequently developed in ways which demonstrate how the nec-
essary inter-relation between expertise and critique – as it unfolds within and
across different ‘deliberatively participative contexts’ – strengthens the former’s
capacity to deliver good and effective interventions reducing risks in both the so-
cial and natural world. Reconciling structural asymmetries of power and knowl-
edge between ‘experts’ and ‘non-experts’ demands more open and inclusive
modes of decision-making in which various ‘publics’, and their concerns are re-
garded a pivotal component of the deliberative processes through which the latter
emerge and are legitimated. But ‘the puzzle is how to have inclusion without col-
lapsing the very concept of expertise, how to engage public judgement in expert
practices in a way that does not reduce to populism’ (Moore 2017: 10).
Moore’s ‘critical elitism’ responds to this theoretical and practical conundrum
by systematically focusing on the inter-connected modes of communication, repre-
sentation, and contestation through which expert/public consensus over ‘wicked
problems’ and the complex solutions they require can be generated and sustained
in ways that break the self-reinforcing relationship between ‘the politicization of
expertise and the depoliticization of politics’. Given thar expert authority is both
a ‘promise’ and a ‘threat’ to democracies – because it offers the means to cope
with the complex risks which the latter face, but those very same means can be-
come a source of unaccountable power – then ways must be discovered and imple-
mented to strike the right balance between ‘trust’ and ‘control’ by experimenting
with different modes of ‘distributed deliberation’. Within the latter, authority is
‘ontologically pluralised’ – that is, it is a precondition for authority’s existence –
and is regarded as ‘a sort of voucher for discursive justification advanced against
a particular good’ (Moore 2017: 74). Also, societal practices of contestation and cri-
tique must play the central role as ‘conditions of possibility of the exercise of citi-
zen judgement and with regard to complex, expert-mediated issues, and are thus
vital to the generation of the democratic authority of expertise’ (Moore 2017: 95).
Only through systems of distributed deliberation based on societal practices of
contestation and critique can ‘active consensuses’ between opposed arguments
and positions be realized and the latter, by their very nature, are open to reap-
praisal and recalibration in the future as new evidence, analyses and evaluations
emerge. Under Moore’s conception of ‘distributed deliberation’, expert-mediated
and societally scrutinized epistemological consensus and the authority it generates
is never final, unconditional or closed as it’s always open to the outcome of future
interactions between ‘expert’ and ‘public’ deliberation.
5 Critical Elitism
181

Finally, Moore considers some of the institutional innovations which might
be required to make the systems of ‘distributed deliberation’ on which critical elit-
ism organizationally-depends practical possibilities. The former, he suggests, aspire
to provide organizational settings in which citizens can engage with experts
through deliberative modes of collective decision-making which positively embrace
the need for critical public scrutiny and the challenge to generate expert/lay con-
sensus over the policies and practices which ‘ill-structured problem solving’ re-
quires. Experiments with such forms of deliberative expert/lay collective decision
making have been attempted across a wide range of policy areas including technol-
ogy, science, medical/health care, environment, transportation and development
(Moore 2017: chapter 7) as policymakers and policy-experts respond to ‘legitimation
pressures’ with discursive and organizational practices in which securing public
trust, involvement and dialogue are their priority. They provide ‘deliberative fo-
rums’ which ‘draw on expertise without being dominated by it’ (Moore 2017: 150)
and in which lay participants have genuine ‘collective voice’ leaving them less
open to manipulation and control by governmental elites and their technocratic
advisors. These types of arrangements often morph into ‘hybrid deliberative bod-
ies’ such as collaborative planning processes and other forms of ‘minipublics’ fo-
cusing on underlying thematic issues of risk, uncertainties, and trade-offs between
‘competing collective goods’ in major policy domains such as abortion, electoral re-
form and biotechnology. Responding both to challenges to expert authority and the
threats of expert hubris and domination, these experiments in institutional inno-
vation have the potential to integrate citizen/lay engagement and expert/techno-
cratic governance within distributed deliberative forums meetings ‘the demands
for communicative accountability and justification without empowering critics to
veto or obstruct democratically authorized purposes and delegation’ (Moore
2017: 178).
Moore’s theorization of critical elitism speaks to the key issue of the ‘politics
of extension’ highlighted by Collins (2013, 2020) and Eyal (2019) as the ‘deference
model of expert authority’ is finally forced to give way to its democratic counter-
part- that is, how far can the democratization of expert authority go in its ever-wid-
ening inclusion of lay publics until the knowledge boundaries between experts and
non-experts effectively dissolve away? Given, as Eyal (2019: 31) argues, our knowl-
edge systems are governed by expert abstractions, theories, models and methodol-
ogies which do not easily lend themselves to lay understanding and evaluation,
then how far can lay participation be extended without compromising the very ef-
fectiveness and trustworthiness of expertise? This built-in ‘trust/control dilemma’
generates a political dynamic through which expert power must be legitimated
through the publics’ acceptance of its right and capacity to take decisions on
their behalf because they believe that it’s in their collective interest to do so. How-
182
Chapter 7: Expert Futures

ever, this acceptance and belief are not unconditional in that they can be renego-
tiated and even withheld in the event of expert authority failing to live up to its
ethical ideals and/or failing to deliver on its performative promises. There are in-
herent limitations to how far expert authority can be democratized along the lines
of maximum lay participation and citizen engagement which go substantially be-
yond the various experiments in institutional innovation outlined by Moore (2017).
As Eyal (2019: 148) insists, they ‘are attractive ethical ideals, but poor machineries
for producing legitimacy. They possess no mechanism for bringing debate to an
end, and no defences against abuse by the merchants of doubt and other deter-
mined and interested parties.’
6 Conclusion
Each of the four responses to the crisis in expert authority and the ‘expert futures’
which they anticipate – rejuvenated meritocracy, technocratic populism, connec-
tive professionalism, and critical elitism – reviewed in this chapter struggle with
the conundrum of how democratic oversight of expertise is to be realized without
damaging the ‘trust rebuilding’ efforts on which the latter depends or conversely
pushing experts into an even more defensive repositioning in which they desper-
ately scramble to reassert their untrammelled autonomy and control. They all
speak to the ‘trust/ control dilemma’ we have highlighted throughout this book
and attempt to provide a reconceptualization of ‘expert authority’ in which the
balance between them shifts in the direction of rebuilding public trust through
greater democratic transparency and accountability without so fatally weakening
expert autonomy and control that they become bereft of any material significance
or symbolic value.
Rejuvenated meritocracy aspires to overhaul the ideology and practice of ‘mer-
itocratic credentialism’ in ways that make it genuinely more open and accessible to
those normally excluded from effectively participating in the competition for op-
portunities and rewards which it entails. ‘Equality of opportunity’ is to be recon-
structed and revitalized in ways that translate its promise into a reality through
enhanced educational and social mobility, better vocational training, affirmative
action and political leadership attuned to the need for ‘levelling up initiatives’ di-
rected at breaking the stranglehold over positional power and wealth enjoyed by
established elites.
Technopopulism envisages a new rapprochement between technical elites and
political leaders around the need to develop winning electoral strategies in which
the critical role of experts and expertise is fully recognized, but without ignoring
the legitimate claims of ‘ordinary people’ to be included in and benefiting from the
6 Conclusion
183

policies and programmes that elected populist governments deliver. Experts are re-
imaged as genuine ‘servants of the people’ rather than ‘servants of power’ and
their expertise is rededicated to the design and delivery of ‘programmes’ and ‘proj-
ects’ better equipping currently disadvantaged groups to compete in the struggle
for material rewards and social recognition.
Connective professionalism anticipates the emergence of a form of professio-
nal work organization and association much more open to the wide range of stake-
holder interests and values which must be fully taken into account when striving
to solve complex problems with sensitivity, compassion and tolerance. Citizens, cli-
ents, and consumers are reimagined as partners in a collaborative endeavour to
deal with seemingly intractable and recalcitrant obstacles standing in the way
of achieving better forms of living for the community as a whole. Deference to ex-
pert authority gives way to relational forms of expertise socially and ethically
grounded in shared understandings of ‘what needs to be done and how it needs
to be done’ if entrenched political polarization and extreme socio-economic in-
equality are to be overcome ‘in the quest for community’ (Nisbet 1969).
Critical elitism calls for a sensible and deliverable balance to be struck be-
tween ‘epistemic authority’ and ‘democratic accountability’ through the design
and construction of innovative institutions which can effectively accommodate de-
liberative decision making around complex social, political and economic prob-
lems inherently resistant to ‘quick fixes’ or ‘bureaucratic massaging’. It recognizes
the inherent limitations of political and administrative strategies aimed at democ-
ratizing expertise, if expert authority is to retain its legitimacy as a trustworthy
and reliable source of specialist knowledge and skill vital to the management of
risk in highly unstable and uncertain environments. In this respect, experts will
retain significant elements of their positioning and status as cognitive or epistemic
elites, but the latter will be exposed to much greater scrutiny and challenge – by
other experts, government agencies, civic groups, social movements, and public in-
terest organizations – than was routinely the case under the deferential model.
However persuasive each of these scenarios for expert futures may be, they
also remain open to further interrogation and contestation – a rejuvenated meri-
tocracy still remains a mechanism for entrenching elite power and wealth how-
ever flexible it may become; technopopulist movements and parties seem to be
eternally distrustful, if not dismissive, of expert authority once they get into gov-
ernment; connective professionalism relies on a communitarian ethos and ethic
which may prove far more difficult to sustain in the long-term when the clamour
of competing sectional interests and values begins to gather political momentum;
finally, critical elitism is ideologically and practically embedded in a political real-
ism which recognizes the trade-offs and rebalances required when ‘change’ seems
184
Chapter 7: Expert Futures

to be transitioning into ‘crisis’ but the question remains as to whether or not the
latter can hold out against rising anti-elitist populism.
Once this wider social and political context is fully considered, then the puta-
tive collapse of the unwritten, informal social contract between states, experts, and
publics through which expert authority was underwritten as a ‘collective good’ re-
quiring no further legitimation or justification seems to cut the ground from un-
derneath all four of the ‘expert futures’ discussed in this chapter.
It is to this pivotal issue – that is, the viability of calls for ‘a new social contract’
to underwrite, if not guarantee, the kind of futures for expert authority reviewed
in this chapter – that we turn in the final chapter of this book.

Chapter 8: Towards a News Social Contract
1 Introduction
Battered and bruised on all sides, ‘expert authority’ – as a concept, relation and
practice – has seen much of its accrued social capital dissipated by waning public
belief in and support for its probity and effectiveness. As the ‘deferential model’
(Moore 2017) of expert authority has increasingly struggled to defend itself against
the accumulated threats posed by political, cultural and technological change, so
the emergence of a ‘democratic/reflexive model’ has striven to fill the intellectual
void left by the former’s eclipse. Yet, it too has struggled to renew the legitimacy
of expert authority and replenish its accumulated social capital as the social and
normative presuppositions on which it’s based have come under extreme and sus-
tained scrutiny, both ‘from above’ and ‘from below’ over the last decade or so in
which ‘crises come along like buses’ – never on their own but in frighteningly
and disturbingly quick succession.
Indeed, ‘continuing crises’ – or ‘permacrisis’ to use the most recent term used
by Collins dictionary – seems to have become the default position over the last dec-
ade or so. As economic crises (financial crisis of 2008/2009 and the decade of aus-
terity which followed) and political crises (presidential election of Trump and
other authoritarian populist leaders from 2016 onwards, and political crisis around
attempts to block Biden’s occupancy of the White House in 2020; UK Brexit from
EU in 2016) have given way to global public health (global Covid-19 pandemic
from 2019/2020) and military conflict crises (Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022
and the prospect of economic recession/stagflation) – and all the while, the climate
change timebomb is ticking away, louder than ever! Moving from ‘passive’ to ‘ac-
tive’ trust as a basis for repurposing, if not remaking, expert authority has proved
to be rather more difficult in practice than the theorists of ‘reflexive moderniza-
tion’ (Beck, Giddens and Lash 1994) seemed to anticipate back in the closing decade
of the twentieth century. Then, globalization was in the ascendancy, both structur-
ally and ideologically, and the overriding problem seemed to be whether liberal
democracies could develop the self-reflexive technologies and cultures required
to cope with whatever dislocations and disillusionments it brought with it. While
this book has indicated that the general thrust of their analysis of the weakening
of institutionalized trust has been confirmed in the early decades of the twenty-
first century, the projections and trajectories which they formulated and anticipat-
ed in relation to rebuilding and renewing ‘active trust’ have proved to be overop-
timistic and oversimplistic. In short, they seriously underestimated how difficult it
would be to revitalize ‘active trust’ in core institutions and practices – such as ex-
https://doi.org/10.1515/9783110734911-009

pert authority – through the instigation of more ‘reflexive governance systems’
when the later were being subjected to escalating ideological, political and techno-
logical pressures to reverse the economic and social gains which globalization had
supposedly produced. As the twenty-first century unfolded, it became increasingly
evident that the destructive dynamic released by neoliberal globalization, digital-
ization, and de-industrialization would be much less easy to contain as the ‘dis-em-
bedding mechanisms ‘on which it depended – particularly expertise and expert
systems (Giddens, Beck and Lash 1994: 82–95) – to do its work would effectively
‘rip-up’ so much of the institutional infrastructure on which the post-1945 liber-
al/social democratic settlement had depended for its stability. Escalating strains
and stresses on the latter revealed that it was much less resilient than many
had assumed as they tested its capacity to absorb structural dislocations and ideo-
logical fractures which challenged its very institutional core and the conventions
on which it depended for its legitimacy.
Relying on institutionalized trust as the primary structural mechanism and
discursive formation through which expert authority has been legitimated is no
longer viable for reasons we have identified throughout the preceding chapters
of this book. The overarching rationale for ‘cutting the umbilical cord’ between in-
stitutionalized trust and expert authority is the increasingly threadbare condition
of the unwritten and implicit social contract between states, experts, and publics
which stabilized the relationship between them within a delicate mesh of informal
understandings, conventions, and norms underwritten by the post-1945 liberal/so-
cial democratic settlement. Both states and publics have become increasingly sus-
picious of, not to say hostile to, the taken-for-granted assumption that experts are
delivering on their side of the bargain which this settlement entailed. This is the
case both in relation to the latter’s intentions and capacities to meet their obliga-
tions under the social democratic consensus which emerged at the end of the Sec-
ond World War. Since they have become key players in a technocratic elite which
turns a collective deaf year to public opinion and has consistently demonstrated its
capacity to circumvent ‘the unwritten rules of the game’ in pursuit of their vested
interests, expert occupations and organizations are now seen as ‘the problem’
rather than ‘the solution’ to tackling complex, high stakes problems in high-risk en-
vironments.
Yet, this done not mean to say that the situation which expert authority is now
placed in is irretrievable – that it is no longer defendable or dependable in the
world we live in now and are likely to live in tomorrow. As we have also consistent-
ly documented in the previous chapters of this book, we will remain dependent on
expert authority for the foreseeable future because the knowledge, insight, and skills
which experts possess remain indispensable to our, individual and collective, at-
tempts to live safer and better lives in an increasingly threatening world. However,
1 Introduction
187

on the other hand, it does mean to say that we need a fundamental rethink and
revision of the liberal/social democratic social contract underpinning the interre-
lationships between states, publics, and experts which is now in need of a radical
overhaul if it is to be up to the challenges that the 21st century presents to all three
collective actors. Institutionalized expert trust, based on a passive, deferential and
defensive modus vivendi between states, experts and publics has become so ossi-
fied that it can no longer provide the substantive, values-based foundations for le-
gitimating expert authority in the twenty-first century. Even if the regulative husk
of its ‘certification ecosystem’ formally remains in place (Kirkpatrick et al. 2021), it
cannot sustain the trust-building mechanisms and relations on which a much more
openly contested, transparent and accountable mode of expert authority must be
legitimated.
There are several intellectual resources we can draw on to get a better under-
standing of what this renewed social contract in which states, experts, and publics
can be re-embedded might look like, and how it may help to legitimate the much
more democratic and reflexive forms of expert authority and governance required
in the 21st century.
We will begin by exploring the intellectual inheritance bequeathed by the
communitarian/Durkheimian tradition in social and organizational theory, high-
lighting its analytical focus on the ‘non contractual foundations of contract’
(Lukes 1975; Wolin 2004; Collier 2018; Courpasson, Younes and Reed 2021). Next,
we proceed to the revival of social contract theory in contemporary political theo-
ry with its renewed emphasis on the need to reconceptualize the ‘modern subject’
as both ‘a bearer of rights’ and ‘a carrier of communal obligations’ (Forrester 2019;
Shafik 2021). Thirdly, we focus on those analysts anticipating the revival of the
social democratic/interventionist state and the ‘collectivist individualism’ on
which it is ideologically predicated as a result of the massive increase in the
scope and depth of governmental action in response to the global pandemic as
it unfolded from 2019/2020 onwards (Kahl and Wright 2021; Cooper and Szreter
2021; Tooze 2021; Gerbaudo 2021). Finally, we return to the contemporary political
sociology of expert work as it attempts to absorb and evaluate what this ‘long dec-
ade of crises’ – and the fundamental rethinking of contemporary socio-political
and organization theory which it generated – means for our understanding of ex-
pert authority ‘beyond contract’ (Fox 1971, 1974, 1985). Here we emphasize the en-
during significance, both theoretical and practical, of the complex networks of
‘countervailing power’ (Reed 2018; Reed and Reed 2022) in which expert authority
is necessarily embedded as coalitions of governing elites, expert organizations, and
public institutions come together to shape ‘the politics of expertise’ in twenty-first
century societies (Stehr and Grundmann 2011; Turner 2014; Moore 2017; Eyal 2019).

Chapter 8: Towards a News Social Contract

2 Non-Contractual Foundations of Contract
Durkheimian/communitarian social and organization theory has consistently em-
phasized the dependency, both structurally and ideologically, of formalized con-
tractual exchanges and relationships on the tacit, implicit and unwritten under-
standings and conventions on which they must rely if they are to function as
protections against rule and promise breaking. As Lukes (1975: 140–160) argues,
Durkheim rejects the Spencerian model of society as nothing more than a sponta-
neous form of social cooperation and coordination emerging automatically from
the free play of individual economic interests requiring only the minimum of
legal regulation to ensure that ‘free exchange’ can continue unencumbered by ex-
ternal interference. This philosophical and sociological reduction of ‘society’ to the
multitude of atomistic contractual exchanges through which economic interests
are spontaneously and temporarily coordinated – which has become the intellec-
tual bedrock of contemporary neoliberal theory (Davies 2014) – treats society as
‘a vast system of bargaining and exchange’ (Lukes 1975: 143) ontologically and the-
oretically stripped of the complex infrastructure of conventions and norms in
which the latter are embedded and on which they necessarily depend for their
functioning. For Durkheim, modern societies are ‘organized social structures char-
acterized by a high degree of interdependence … changes at one point are rapidly
transmitted to others’ (Lukes 1975: 154), so that the social solidarity which emerges
within them cannot be reduced to the free play of individual material interests
and the legal rules through which they are regulated. Indeed, the latter cannot
exist, much less function, without the socially dense and ethically rich configura-
tion of informal conventions and norms in which they are embedded and on which
they depend as ‘trust-building mechanisms’ underpinning the formalized rules
and regulations through which market exchanges are stabilized and regularized.
This Durkheimian/communitarian tradition in social and organization theory
rejects the economic rationalism which has come to dominate social science since
the 1980s, and its intellectual roots in a form of liberal individualism that elevates
the unencumbered pursuit of self-interests to the ‘fundamental essence of morali-
ty’ (Wolin 2004: 362). In denying the philosophical and theoretical significance of
‘organization’ as a living structure constituted by and through a rich and subtle
socio- political life which constantly evades the attempts of formal rules and reg-
ulations to capture it, economic rationalism and neoliberalism cannot even begin
to see how and why its existence pre-empts the very ontological and methodolog-
ical reductionism they rely on for their intellectual legitimacy. As Witztum (2019)
has exhaustively documented in his two-volume philosophical and theoretical de-
construction of both liberal classical and modern economic theory, the continuing
failure of the latter to recognize the historical roots of ‘rationality’ in ‘sociality’
2 Non-Contractual Foundations of Contract
189

means that it is constitutionally incapable of understanding the inherently dynam-
ic relationship between individuals and society because of its innate propensity to
reduce social reality to conceptual abstractions that ‘freeze’ the latter in fixed,
timeless and context-less categories.
Communitarianism, as mediated through the writings of philosophers such as
MacIntyre (1981/1985, 1988), Horton and Mendus (1994) and sociologists such as Fox
(1971, 1974, 1985) and Anthony (1977, 1986), has undergone something of an intellec-
tual renaissance of late in contemporary organization and social theory (Nielsen
2006; Collier 2018; Forrester 2019). In so doing, it has renewed and refocused atten-
tion on the vital ‘obligation-building’ role of communal values and norms as they
nurture and expand our innate inclinations and capacities as social beings to col-
laborate with others in pursuit of collective projects requiring the subsuming of
individual interests within wider social goals.
Fox’s (1971, 1974) analysis of the complex dynamic between a ‘low trust/low dis-
cretion’ and ‘high trust/high discretion’ syndrome within modern organizations is
indicative of this Durkheimian/communitarian tradition and the various ways in
which it continues to speak to control relationships within ‘the neoliberal organi-
zation’ (Courpasson, Reed and Younes 2021). He suggests that organizational man-
agers veer between a control strategy driven by the priority of securing worker
compliance through a combination of tight disciplinary surveillance and external-
ly imposed sanctions in which the risk of potential resistance and misbehaviour is
minimized through fear and coercion, as opposed to one that radically shifts the
emphasis towards securing worker commitment through ‘trust building’ mecha-
nisms encouraging collective problem-solving and shared risk taking. While recog-
nizing that this ‘control/trust dynamic’ is subject to considerable historical and
socio-cultural variation, in true Durkheimian fashion Fox contends that the
move towards a ‘high trust/high discretion’ strategy combining social integration
and solidarity signals a shift ‘beyond contract’ in which the traditional conception
of ‘master-servant relationship’ underpinning economic rationalism and liberal-
ism is superseded by notions of social partnership and workers’ democracy.
Whatever the inherent philosophical and theoretical limitations of this Dur-
kheimian/communitarian tradition in socio-political and organizational theory, it
has the undoubted intellectual and practical benefit of reminding us of the ‘non-
contractual foundations of contract’ and the crucial role they will play in rebuild-
ing trust in expert authority as it struggles to renew its social contract with states
and publics. It shows that any attempts to develop a new social contract between
publics, states and experts must be grounded in an appreciation of the structural
tensions, contradictions and conflicts that are likely to continue to prevail between
them, however quickly and far we move ‘beyond contract’ into a more ‘high trust/
high discretion’ reflexive governance regime.

3 Social Contract Theory
By refocusing attention on the non-contractual foundations of contract, the Dur-
kheimian/communitarian tradition in social and organization theory highlights
the crucial importance of what MacIntyre (1981) sees as the necessary interde-
pendence – functional, political and ethical – between ‘institutions’ and ‘practices.’
As Moore and Beadle (2006) reflect, as a communitarian theorist, MacIntyre also
sees the systemic contradictions and tensions embodied in this ‘love/hate’ relation-
ship between institutions/organizations and the values/practices through which
they are generated and reproduced. While institutions/organizations and their
managers are primarily concerned with achieving ‘external goods’ geared to
long-term survival within a competitive and hostile environment, practices/values
valorise ‘internal goods’ aligned to cooperative care and communal wellbeing
which often come into conflict with managerial priorities. Managerial logics driven
by the search for contractual relationships giving the institution/organization a de-
gree of security and stability unavoidably clash with communal logics in which the
nurturing and curation of collective mutuality and respect between people is the
overriding obligation, irrespective of its impact on formalized legal agreements.
Recent developments in social contract theory (Forrester 2019; Shafik 2021;
Hennessy 2021; Tooze 2021; Gerbaudo 2021) attempt to rework the concept of ‘social
contract’ so that it can more effectively bridge the underlying tensions between
‘rights-based’ theories of protecting individual liberty and ‘obligations-based’ the-
ories of sustaining collective wellbeing. Forrester’s (2019) detailed conceptual de-
construction and historical reconstruction of the ‘social contract tradition’ in liber-
al egalitarian political philosophy and it’s theoretical anchoring in Rawls’ A Theory
of Justice (1971), forensically identifies the exposure of the latter to a communitar-
ian critique which refuses to accept the deracinated conception of human agency it
depends on to make its arguments work. This communitarian critique also chal-
lenges the first principles on which liberal egalitarian, individual rights-based the-
orizations of ‘justice as fairness’ is based and does the philosophical groundwork
on which a thorough going rejection of ‘meritocratic credentialism’ (as discussed in
chapter 6 of this book) can be carried forward. Thus, communitarian philosophers
such as MacIntyre (1981) prepared the theoretical ground for communitarian soci-
ologists such as Nisbet (1969, 1970) and Etzioni (1993) to mount a defence of human
agents as ‘institution builders’ who are continually engaged in social practices en-
tailing wider communal obligations which cannot be reduced to their individual
self-interests and the ‘utilitarian decision-making calculus’ through which they
are prioritized.
Contemporary attempts to revivify the social contract tradition in socio-polit-
ical and organization theory seem to have learnt the lessons of this ongoing dia-

191

logue between liberalism and communitarianism by calling for a renewal of the
shared ethical frameworks and institutional relationships through which human
agents can collectively thrive across the generations. In this respect, Shafik’s
(2021: 2) call for ‘a new social contract’ is predicated on the assumption that the
norms and rules governing how collective institutions operate are ‘the most impor-
tant determinants of the kind of lives we lead. Because it is so important and be-
cause most people cannot easily leave their societies, the social contract requires
the consent of the majority and periodic renegotiation as circumstances change’.
Here she is explicitly recognizing the inherently dynamic character of the social
contract and why its structure and content must be open to review and renewal
as the balance between trust/control relationships shifts in response to the chang-
ing socio-historical context within which it is embedded. Individual self-interests
and the decision-making mechanisms through which they are translated into for-
malized preferences subject to contractual regulation, alone, cannot provide the
tools and aides which we require to navigate our way through the complex and
dense networks of mutual obligations and collective relationships on which we de-
pend to live better and more fulfilling lives. Instead, we have no choice but to rely
on extended norms of reciprocity and the shared expectations which they embody
as we collectively build the institutional frameworks and supportive normative in-
frastructures on which they rely to gain legitimacy and stability.
This ‘partnership model’ of the social contract in which individual and collec-
tive agents can pool their risks and routinely engage in collaborative relationships
to their mutual benefit and wellbeing takes us, conceptually and substantively, con-
siderably beyond the liberal egalitarian and utilitarian tradition in which rights-
based theorizations of justice and fairness were originally formulated. It also high-
lights the growing disappointment and disillusionment of those individuals and
groups who had been led to expect something much better from those key collec-
tive actors, such as states, political and business elites and technocratic managers,
who had promised so much but had failed to deliver on their side of the social con-
tract with the general public. As the latter becomes more fragmented and fissured
through the cumulative impact of political, economic and technological changes po-
larizing and dividing groups and communities into mutually hostile and suspicious
‘interests’, so the capacity of the ‘partnership model’ to sustain social solidarity and
collective action is seriously called into question.
Shafik’s (2021) proposals for designing a new social contract are based on
three core principles and a range of organizational mechanisms for translating
the latter into actionable projects and programmes. First amongst the former is
a call for minimum economic security for all as provided through universal
basic income schemes tailored to guaranteeing a decent standard of living for
all citizens relative to prevailing levels of economic prosperity within the countries
192
Chapter 8: Towards a News Social Contract

in which they live. Second, there is a demand for maximum investment in citizens’
capabilities allowing them to realize their full productive potential and to contrib-
ute to the common good of their countries for as long as they are able through life-
time training and personal development programmes. Thirdly, is the principle of
pooled or shared risk-taking such that individuals, families and communities can
be confident that if they face difficult economic and social conditions they can
reply on material and moral support from the state, businesses, public agencies
and civic organizations to help them navigate their way through these trying times.
These principles and their policy implications, Shafik (2021: 188) are based
on the axiomatic premise that ‘a more generous and inclusive social contract
would recognize our interdependencies, provide minimum protections to all,
share some risks collectively and ask everyone to contribute as much as the can
for as long as they can’. She also insists that this new social contract does not entail
the uncontrolled expansion of the welfare state and the bureaucratic apparatus re-
quired to administer it, but it does demand a much more inclusive and supportive
institutional framework for collectively managing the inevitable disruption and
dislocation that rapid technological, political and social change will impose on
those least prepared to withstand their impact.
Such a set of general principles and their broad policy implications has gar-
nered ideological support across the political spectrum from the centre/left (Etzio-
ni 1993; Srnicek and Williams 2015; Hutton 2015; Reich 2016; Collier 2018; Coats
2018; Cruddas 2021) and from those sympathetic to a more progressive and inclu-
sive populism (Seymour 2014: Mouffe 2018; Frank 2020; Sandel 2020). However, it is
the Covid-19 pandemic and its implications for the possibility of a new social con-
tract to emerge which has generated most debate about a ‘post-pandemic future’ in
which the latter becomes a political and social necessity rather than an increasing-
ly attractive policy option in an increasingly uncertain world.
In a UK context, Hennessy (2021) has recently insisted that the pandemic has
been the biggest collective experience of the British people since the Second World
War and constitutes a ‘new Beveridge moment’ in which the state and other collec-
tive agencies have been called upon to protect the safety and security of its popu-
lation on a scale and scope unheard of since that time. In ideological and political
terms, he argues, this entailed an unqualified recognition by the government and a
wide range of economic, social and cultural organizations that they owed ‘a duty
of care’ to its citizens which could only be delivered if the state, the professions and
the public came together in a new social settlement geared to its overriding mis-
sion of protecting the collective wellbeing of all. This would generate ‘a new,
more consensual politics and a shared programme made possible by that consen-
sus, strengthening it in a cycle of mutual reinforcement’ (Hennessy 2021: 131)
through a ‘new Beveridge’ in which a long-term programme of reform tackling in-
3 Social Contract Theory
193

justice, inequality and economic/technical underperformance simultaneously
would become a political reality. This would be focused on improved social care
provision, a rapidly expanded social housing programme, enhanced technical ed-
ucation, gearing our economy and society up for artificial intelligence, and mitigat-
ing and combating climate change over a period stretching to 2045. It would also
include specific policies relating to a universal basic income, improved welfare
support for those struggling to avoid the poverty trap and a reformed justice sys-
tem in which the dispensation of timely and fair justice is guaranteed to all of
those who come before it.
Tooze (2021) and Gerbaudo (2021) analyse the long-term impact of the pandem-
ic on our economy, society and politics at a more global level. Tooze (2021: 28–41)
begins with an excoriating critique of the ‘organized irresponsibility’ – a theme
that we have previously discussed in this book – which dominated government
thinking about the threats which biomedical catastrophes pose to their citizens
in which ‘preparedness’ and ‘mitigation’ rather than ‘eradication’ or ‘overcoming’
become the overriding imperatives governing state policy. As a result, ‘there is no
willingness to make structural changes to our food chain or transport system to
reduce risk or even to invest in an adequate public health system’ (Tooze 2021:
35) and, in turn, this leads to widespread state failure to protect its citizens’
lives – the core normative and political foundation of the modern state’s existential
rationale as identified by Hobbes in the late seventeenth century (Garrard 2022).
This generates not just economic and social dislocation on a massive scale but
also a major political crisis fundamentally calling into question the willingness
and capacity of modern states to take responsibility for their citizens’ wellbeing
and to engage in the forward-looking planning and interventions which the dis-
charge of the latter requires. Indeed, too many administrations, at all levels of gov-
erning, seemed more than prepared to pursue a policy of ‘trade-offs’ in which legal
regulations, normative conventions and ethical considerations could be, tempora-
rily, ‘put to one side’ in balancing-out the, admittedly regretful, loss of human life
against business interests and ‘state raison’. If protecting national health care sys-
tems from being overwhelmed and collapsing eventually emerged as the driver of
state policy and action during the first two years of the pandemic – as the threat
which it posed to collective order and individual liberty waxed and waned with
alarming unpredictability – then this would leave those individuals, groups, organ-
izations and societies most dangerously exposed to its ravages to fend for them-
selves as best they could.
Yet, Tooze also goes on to argue that ‘organized irresponsibility’ gradually gave
way to collective responses which, however piecemeal and contested they proved
to be in practice, paved the way for policies, programmes and projects that took
the threat posed by biomedical crises much more seriously and developed ‘expert
194
Chapter 8: Towards a News Social Contract

systems’ of various kinds – surveillance technologies, vaccine development pro-
grammes, and economic recovery strategies – to cope with their more damaging
impacts (see chapter 5 of this book for more detail). He concludes that the collec-
tive capacities of governments and societies to mobilize the massive scientific and
technical resources required to mount effective responses to future pandemics and
the existential threats they pose to ‘our way of life’ will determine whether ‘organ-
ized responsibility’ prevails. Without key established institutions such as central
banking to provide the ultimate support for market-based financing, the technos-
cientific networks needed to develop effective vaccines at such a rapid pace and
the resilience of health and medical systems in the face of stress-testing pressures
of a scale and intensity never experienced, the, interim, outcome of the pandemic
would have been very different. Nevertheless, he accepts that the evaluation of the
threats posed by ‘reflexive modernization’, as provided Beck, Giddens and others
in the 1980s and 1990s, have been vindicated by the Covid-19 pandemic insofar as it
reinforced our continued dependency on governing institutions alone having the
collective capacity to respond to ‘systemic mega-risks’ in the face of which neolib-
eral shibboleths such as ‘free markets’ or ‘minimal states’ simply crumbled. They
remain the ultimate providers of ‘organized responsibility’ because only they can
legitimately mobilize the vast resources which ‘systemic mega-risk management’
requires in ways that secure the levels of generalized public trust and compliance
on which the latter depends for its authority and efficacy.
Tooze (2021: 303) concludes his analysis with a fulsome recognition of the stra-
tegic role that interdependent networks of elite and expert power will continue to
play in systemic mega-risk management. Only by identifying and dissecting these
elite/expert power networks can we hope to uncover ‘the thickets of analysis, in-
formation, and knowledge produced day by day from inside the apparatus as its
protagonists struggle to cope with the radical outcomes that their systems are pro-
ducing’. It is this ‘arcane expertise’ which lies at the organizational core of the
power-knowledge systems which simultaneously contain and intensify the existen-
tial risks we all face in a high risk, high stakes world where the pace and scale of
change has accelerated in ways that seem to challenge our capacity, individually
and collectively, to deal with them.
Finally, Gerbaudo (2021) provides a synoptic overview of ‘the return of the
state’ under the cumulative pressures generated by economic recession, technolog-
ical rationalization, biomedical crisis and political chaos since the financial crash
of 2008/2009. Neoliberal ideology has been seriously ‘found out’ as these crises have
come together to present it with systemic challenges requiring collectivist respons-
es in which the central state and its supporting governing institutions are the ‘only
game in town’ if its centuries old promise of protecting the safety and security of
its citizens is to be kept. Although neoliberal ideology, policy and practice has
3 Social Contract Theory
195

moved closer to an authoritarian populism in which national sovereignty, econom-
ic protectionism and cultural identity have become the dominant themes, there is
increasing evidence that this will not save it from deep-rooted structural transfor-
mations moving in the direction of a new post-pandemic, neo-statist politics in
which ‘government protectivism’ emerges as the key trend and new reality. This
movement has entailed the return to a more inward-looking politics – in stark con-
trast to the outward-looking politics which dominated the era of neoliberal global-
ization – in which internal order, security and safety becomes the dominant con-
cern as we struggle to cope with the extreme uncertainty and polarization that the
‘era of continuing crises’ has produced.
Both right and left-leaning populist movements and parties have exploited this
demand for ‘taking back control’ through the promotion of nationalist-based ideol-
ogies and policies that reject the dominance of an elite politics in which the capaci-
ty for collective action has been effectively outsourced to international bodies and
corporations in which a clique of global ‘experts’ replaces the role once performed
by the state. As Norris and Inglehart (2019: 66) suggest in their exhaustive review of
authoritarian populism across the globe:
populists claim legitimacy from direct popular expression reflecting the voice of the people,
where majority preferences override minority interests. The authority of the voice of the
people is valued even when at odds with professional experts (‘Britain has had enough of ex-
perts’), legal authorities (‘so called judges’), main-stream media commentators (‘fake news’),
scientists (‘climate change is a hoax’), and elected politicians (‘just in it for themselves’).
However, as Gerbaudo (2021) insists, this return to ‘the politics of interiority’ has a
progressive potential as well as a regressive drive; it reasserts the centrality of the
need for collective democratic control over institutions and resources in the face
of natural and social existential threats of a magnitude and complexity defying
market-based and technocratic solutions. Growing appreciation of the extent to
which neoliberal globalization has directly and indirectly reinforced extreme in-
equality and insecurity opens-up political spaces in which collective action – at
a wide range of levels of political organization from the central state to civil society
and across a broad swathe of organizational forms from the business corporation
to the voluntary agency – is given a renewed lease of life as a mechanism and ve-
hicle to rebalance and rebuild through democratic decision making. Only in this
way can the ‘hollowing out’ of formal democratic institutions by neoliberal global-
ization and authoritarian populism be reversed so that great areas of political de-
cision-making, either outsourced to an international cadre of brokers and experts
or delegated to unelected national authorities, can be returned to their rightful lo-
cation in a range of public arenas where ‘expertise can be reconciled with democ-
racy’. Within the latter, a new middle class of well-educated and relatively young
196
Chapter 8: Towards a News Social Contract

‘knowledge workers’ and professionals across the public and private sectors are
likely to play the critical role in providing the technical expertise and cultural le-
gitimacy for a new form of ‘post-pandemic politics’ in which central governments,
regional/local agencies and business corporations come together to pursue a policy
agenda in which sovereignty, security, sustainability and control are the overriding
themes.
In their very different ways, the analysts previously reviewed in this section
are searching for the renewal of the social contract between states, experts and
publics which has all but been destroyed during an era in which socio-economic
dislocation and political polarization have pushed it on to the margins of debate.
Yet, they all realize that this process of renewal must be undertaken in very differ-
ent conditions and constraints from those prevailing between the mid-1940s and
early-1980s. In addition, they accept that ‘reconciling expertise and democracy’ is
going to be particularly difficult when experts seem to have played such a signifi-
cant part in ripping-up the very foundations of the social democratic settlement
through their design and operation of systems and technologies which so radically
disrupted and destabilized the ‘shared protective expectations’ on which the latter
had rested. Thus, the key question remains as to how the ‘disembedding mecha-
nisms’ which lie at the core of expert systems – that is, their inherent logical
drive and organizational capacity to rip, stretch and codify localized knowledge,
skills and routines away from their situated contexts so that they become trans-
formed into portable and remote technologies (Beck, Giddens and Lash 1995) –
are to be reprogrammed and repurposed to facilitate ‘re-embedding strategies’
in which localized control, security and stability can be revitalized.
Cooper and Szreter’s (2021) historical study of the vital role that ‘collectivist
individualism’ has played in managing existential biomedical crises in the UK
since the seventeenth century gives us very real insight into how expert authority
and governance have come to serve the wider community in the past and can con-
tinue to do so in the future. They contrast the way the Covid-19 crisis has been
managed in the UK with the emergence of the Elizabethan Poor Law inaugurated
in 1601 and the ways in which it supported England’s economic growth over the
next 150 years, as well as the period after the Second World War when the welfare
state was constructed. By the time the Covid-19 crisis hit the UK in 2019/2020, it had
experienced a series of central government administrations which had managed a
decade or more of retreat into a neoliberal minimal state totally and utterly unpre-
pared to cope with a microbial existential threat due to long-term disinvestment in
the public infrastructure through which the latter could be effectively managed.
This retreat from the liberal/social democratic welfare state into the neoliberal/
minimal state also entailed radically undermining the ideology of ‘collectivist indi-
vidualism’ on which the former had rested with its historical roots deep in the
3 Social Contract Theory
197

Tudor era when the institutional foundations of a modern British nation were laid
down.
Cooper and Szreter (2021) also maintain that this retreat into a minimalist,
disempowered neoliberal state was carried through over a number of linked his-
torical phases – the financial deregulation of the 1980s/1990s in which corporate
and finance capital became the dominant economic and political coalition within
the UK as its economy completed its transition into a form of ‘rentier capitalism’
(Christophers 2020) where it became ‘butler to the world’ (Bullough 2022) which
was followed by a wider deregulation of public services in which ‘just in time’ de-
livery by marketized and privatized agencies in healthcare, public health, social
care, education and justice became the overriding political imperative – which
ate away, locust-like, at the ‘collectivist individualism’ which had legitimated the
liberal/social democratic welfare state. But this retreat from the post-Second
World War welfare state and the implicit social contract underpinning it ‘hit the
buffers’ as the Covid-19 crisis unfolded and widening asymmetries of wealth,
power and status which the neoliberal state proactively deepened severely weak-
ened the collective capacity of the country to respond effectively. Emerging cracks
in the neoliberal order, incrementally constructed since the 1980s, started to be-
come chasms as the neoliberal state and its incumbent political elite repeatedly
failed to accept the enormity of the crisis which faced them and the scale of the
collective response which it would require if it was to be contained and brought
under public control.
Renewal of the ‘collectivist individualism’ – that is, reviving the dynamic bal-
ance and ideological fusion between ‘collectivism’ and ‘individualism’, between
practices and relations which prioritize communal wellbeing and those which pro-
tect individual rights and personal freedom – which has informed public policy
and practice in the UK over centuries of its history has become both a political
and moral necessity according to Cooper and Szreter (2021: 286–317). The ‘negative
liberty’ on which UK neoliberal/rentier capitalism depends for its ideological oxy-
gen and political momentum has been exposed to a test which it has completely
failed to pass in that it has left millions of its citizens facing the trials and tribu-
lations of the Covid-19 crisis alone and bereft of protection from that institution
which, above all others, is charged with guarding their safety and security –
that is, the central state and its panoply of supporting agencies and organizations.
While the success of the vaccine programme may have ‘saved the political bacon’ of
governing elites for now, sustained reinvestment, financial, political and social, in
universal public services by a newly empowered and modernised welfare state is
the only way in which we are going to enhance our collective preparedness for ‘cri-
ses to come’.
198
Chapter 8: Towards a News Social Contract

Cooper and Szreter (2021: 318–350) conclude their analysis with an outline of
the core principles on which this renewal of the tradition of collectivist individu-
alism and its legitimation of a proactive state and an empowering society are to be
founded. These range widely across a spectrum of values from ‘respective and in-
clusive support for all’ to a participatory politics in which democratic and civic en-
gagement are revitalized. Echoing the call for a new social contract between states,
experts and publics repeatedly made by the analysts and researchers considered
in this section of our book, they put a renewed call for a democratically account-
able and publicly visible expertise – as displayed during the pandemic – at the cen-
tre of their recommendations. As Cooper and Szreter (2021: chapters 2, 3 and 13)
serially demonstrate, public service expertise – in public health, healthcare, bio-
medical science and other critical domains of collective intervention – was consis-
tently challenged and undermined by private sector corporate power and incum-
bent political elites determined to profit from the Covid-19 crisis to the greatest
degree possible, even if this meant endangering the general public as a result (Cal-
vert and Arbuthnot 2021).
Once again, this raises the question as to how a contemporary ‘political soci-
ology of expertise’ might play a significant role in helping to translate these aspi-
rations for a new social contract and a renewed collectivist individualism into re-
ality.
4 Political Sociology of Expertise
Working within a mainstream neo-institutional approach within the sociology
of organizations, Muzio, Aulakh and Kirkpatrick (2019) have recently presented
a broadly reassuring – theoretically, empirically and normatively – appraisal of
the continuing longevity and resilience of professionalized modes of work organ-
ization and occupational regulation. For them, the contemporary sociology of or-
ganizations remains focused on a social phenomenon that retains the institution-
alized trust of the societies in which it is embedded and has continued to cope in
an exemplary fashion with the technological, ideological and political disruptions
it has faced so that it retains its established social legitimacy and moral authority.
However, even though this, largely unqualified, reassuring narrative might be seen
as somewhat complacent by some researchers – and as will be crystal clear to any
readers of our book by now, this would certainly be our view – even they must
admit that ‘the field might also be enhanced by incorporating the sociology of
the professions within a more inclusive ‘sociology of expertise’ (Muzio, Aulakh
and Kirkpatrick 2019: 66). In this way, their relatively narrow and single-stranded
focus on the institutionalized logics through which jurisdictional boundary man-
4 Political Sociology of Expertise
199

agement, task control, and formal regulation become reasonably well-integrated
and stabilized can be at least complemented, if not superseded, by a much
wider and inclusive analytical lens through the development of a contemporary
political sociology of expertise properly attuned to the multiple threats that the es-
tablished ‘professional state’ faces (Burns 2019; Saks 2021).
Unlike neo-institutionalist perspectives in the sociology of professions/occupa-
tions which tend to assume that ‘professional authority’ is necessarily embedded
in and reproduced by the institutional logic from which it derives its legitimacy,
a ‘political sociology of expertise’ must treat the latter as ‘essentially contested’
as an interrelated concept, relation, and practice. Neo-institutional theory (Thorn-
ton, Ocasio and Lounsbury 2012: 29) presumes that legitimacy, and hence authority,
is based on the shared preference that humans and organizations have ‘for cer-
tainty, predictability, and survivability [so that] much behaviour falls into the cat-
egory of seeking legitimacy to garner resources which sustain existing institutions.’
While later versions of the institutional logics’ perspective give greater emphasis to
the power politics and material interests which drive this inherent tendency to-
wards the cyclical reproduction of legitimacy and authority through ‘institutional
isomorphism’ – that is, the various developmental processes and trajectories
through which organizations, occupations and organizations come to resemble
each other – it remains an axiomatic assumption on which neo-institutionalist so-
ciology of professions has been predicated. Underlying pressures driving towards
organizational isomorphism will cyclically self-reproduce the processes and struc-
tures through which organizations and occupations secure legitimation and au-
thority within the fields in which they operate. Thus, Muzio, Aulak and Kirkpatrick
(2019) restrict their discussion of ‘cultural de-legitimation and the loss of confi-
dence in expertise’ to declining cultural support for professional expertise and
waning trust in professional socialization which various self-corrective mecha-
nisms, such as tighter formal regulation and more transparent external scrutiny,
will correct to enable reconfigured forms of ‘hybrid professionalism’ to prosper
in the future. They omit to engage with the more fundamental critiques of expert
authority and what Weber called the ‘structures of domination’ and Foucault iden-
tified as the dominant ‘discursive formations’ through which its legitimacy is, how-
ever contingently and temporarily, secured. Their institutionalist proclivities in-
cline them to a social ontology in which underlying evolutionary dynamics will,
eventually, self-correct the temporary instabilities, even short-term crises, which
any social ecology of occupations, organizations and professions undergoes in
order to ensure its long-term survivability and prosperity. Institutionalization is
a guarantor of professionalized occupational forms and their underling social le-
gitimacy because it always ‘comes to the rescue’ as a self-correcting mechanism re-
200
Chapter 8: Towards a News Social Contract

pairing temporary breakdowns in public trust and reputation and restabilizing the
formal organizational scaffolding around which they can be rebuilt.
Once we move away from this neo-institutionalist approach to the sociology
of professions towards a political sociology of expertise in which the legitimacy
and authority of experts are subject to continuing contestation and instability,
then a much wider range of theoretical possibilities open-up in which the enduring
socio-political realities of the latter’s, collective and individual, existence can be
brought into analytical focus. As an ‘essentially contested’ concept, relation, and
practice, expert authority is made and remade out of the struggles – intellectual,
social, and technical – through which it is legitimated in a sociohistorical context
in which there is no underlying guarantee that it will be reproduced through the
process of institutionalization and the evolutionary dynamics which determine its
trajectory and outcome. To say that a concept, relation, and practice such as ‘expert
authority’ is ‘essentially contested’ is to argue that it necessarily and contingently
entails open-ended disputes about its meaning, status and relevance (Connolly
1983) which cannot be permanently settled or resolved because they are integral
to its application and significance. In this respect, ‘expert authority’ is an apprais-
ive concept, relation, and practice ‘in that the situation it describes is a valued ach-
ievement, when the practice described is internally complex in that its character-
ization involves reference to several dimensions’ (Connolly 1983: 10 emphases in
original). Consensus around shared rules of interpretation and application can
and do emerge, but they are always subject to challenge and revision as new
and unforeseen situations arise that open them up to further interrogation and re-
appraisal in the light of what the latter entail.
There can be little or no doubt that we are living in times when there have
been seismic shifts in the material conditions and structural contexts in which
‘expert authority’ is understood, organized and undertaken so that its meaning
and status as an appraisive concept, relation, and practice need to be fundamen-
tally re-evaluated and reset. This relates both to the similarities and differences be-
tween ‘expert authority’ when compared to other forms and modalities of author-
ity and to its resilience and sustainability under the extreme pressures to which it
has been subjected as they have been identified and assessed in previous chapters
of this book.
Although ‘expertise’ comes in a very wide range of forms and modalities (Col-
lins 2009, 2013, Collins et al. 2020), its contested authorization as a legitimate and
trusted practice differentiates it from other types of authority even if they are all,
ultimately, based on power relations and the legitimacy struggles that coalesce
around them. These legitimacy struggles make and remake expert authority as a
distinctive concept, relation and practice as they are shaped and reshaped by
the ‘trust/control dynamics’ that drive the former.
4 Political Sociology of Expertise
201

Considered in this way, expert authority has a number of interrelated and de-
fining dimensions which differentiate it from other forms and modalities of au-
thority. First, expert authority is hierarchically structured but is increasingly re-
quired to extend its socio-political base significantly beyond those ‘experts’ who
claim it if it is to be successful in mobilizing its ‘legitimacy claims’ within the so-
cieties in which it operates. Second, this structural or systemic tension between ‘au-
tonomy/control’ and ‘accessibility/trust’ is likely to become even more complex and
disruptive as experts, either through choice or necessity, reach out beyond the ju-
risdictional domains in which they are most comfortable to engage with wider au-
diences and stakeholders who are already more sceptical, even suspicious, about
their ‘legitimacy claims’. Third, there is the issue of how the increasing plurality
and diversity of expertise might complicate attempts to bring it under more inclu-
sive and participative governance arrangements without compromising its capaci-
ty to ‘do its job properly’ as it comes under ever more intrusive forms of public
scrutiny and accountability. Finally, there remains the overriding problem of ‘if
and how’ experts can continue to perform their vital role in mobilizing and medi-
ating specialist knowledge under conditions of extreme instability and uncertainty
when the political pressure to produce results that work rapidly and convincingly
intensifies.
Expert authority is hierarchically structured epistemologically, institutionally,
and organizationally: forms of specialist knowledge are differentially ranked in re-
lation to the processes through which they are produced and reproduced, as well
as to their reliability and relevance for problem solving; the institutional source
and standing of these specialist knowledges plays a critical role in determining
how they are rated both by fellow specialists and the public at large; the jurisdic-
tional work domains which these specialist knowledges support and legitimate are
also subject to wider evaluation as to their relative status and prestige so that ‘rep-
utational politics’ has a major impact on the material resources and social support
they receive from the societies in which they are embedded (Stehr and Grund-
mann 2014; Turner 2014; Moore 2017; Collins et al. 2020). This interrelated hierarch-
ical structuring process generates a multiplicity of problems for any movement,
policy or programme aimed at ‘democratizing expertise’ because it highlights
the inherent limits of the latter and exposes the systemic tension between ‘expert
authority’ and ‘political authority’ (Heazle and Kane 2016; Moore 2017; Collins et al.
2020).
Heazle and Kane (2016) maintain that ‘expert authority’ and ‘political author-
ity’ relate to each other in highly variable and complex ways depending on the
wider political regimes in which they are located and the specific socio-historical
contexts in which their dynamic relationship unfolds. Nevertheless, they contend
that there is a systemic tension between them to the extent that ‘expertise’ is le-

gitimated through scientifically generated and validated claims to specialist knowl-
edge and technical skill, while ‘policy’ is justified based on goals and priorities
emerging from ideological values and the material interests they promote. This dis-
tinction has been questioned by successive waves of conceptual and empirical re-
search over the last decade or so, but its credibility has been sustained through the
development of a more nuanced and sensitive appreciation of the interplay be-
tween ‘epistemological credentialism’ and ‘political authorization’. The ‘linear ra-
tional’ model of policy development and implementation in which ‘science and pol-
itics are wholly autonomous and distinct’ (Heazle and Kane 2016: 6) has been seen
to be conceptually and empirically unsustainable. However, more recent formula-
tions of the relationship suggest an interdependency which is ‘messy, dynamic,
contested and unstable’ but which generates sufficient expert legitimacy and polit-
ical consensus to move forward incrementally across a range of policy areas such
as climate change, environmental health, nuclear power and assisted reproductive
technology. While research in these, and other, policy domains reveal an in-built
tendency for expert authority to become politicized as the struggle for legitimacy
intensifies, the former remains robust enough to resist political domination as long
as liberal/social democratic ‘checks and balances’ remain in place to counter the
challenges posed by populism or neoliberalism.
Yet, this shift towards a more sociologically and politically realistic analysis of
the tensions between ‘expertise’ and ‘politics’ leaves unresolved what Collins et al.
(2020: 83) call ‘the problem of extension’ and its relationship to ‘the problem of le-
gitimacy’. While the former problem relates to increasing the diversity of expert
decision-making sufficiently to include both ‘experience-based’ experts and ‘tech-
nically-based’ experts, the latter refers to the democratization of policy making
in order to ensure that it doesn’t become dominated by a narrow range of scien-
tific experts and technocrats excluding other relevant points of view. Collins et al.
(2020) suggest that both issues can be dealt with my demarcating the ‘technical’
from the ‘political’ phases of policy making and implementation such that ‘partic-
ipation in the technical phase is limited to those with relevant specialist expertise
but participation in the political phase remains open to all citizens’. However, the
question remains as how sustainable this division of labour between ‘technical’
and ‘political’ phases or domains of policy making proves to be when ‘it is likely
that expert authority will more often be hijacked by political interests that selec-
tively support one expert position over another on the basis of its ability to fit with
policy rather than its ability to inform policy’ (Heazle and Kane 2016: 191 emphases
in original). This suggests that the boundaries between ‘expert’ and ‘political’ au-
thority have become so permeable and diluted that the former is always likely
to face the prospect of being penetrated, if not dominated, by the latter as our ear-
lier analysis of expert authority during the pandemic indicates (see chapter 5).
4 Political Sociology of Expertise
203

Yet, expert authority must retain the epistemological power and organization-
al capacity to challenge the political status quo whatever its ideological predilec-
tions and policy agenda because they are crucial to retaining its legitimacy and
trust-building capability. As Eyal (2019: 93) consistently argues, the crisis in expert
authority is recursive in the sense that it varies in scale and intensity temporally
and spatially but is cyclical and persistent in its dynamics and effects insofar as it
relates to ‘the institutional frames and mechanisms that organize deliberation, and
especially of the temporal frames that separate, in time, technical problem-solving
from political decisions.’ As Weber and Foucault insist (O’Neil 1986; Reed 1999), ex-
pert authority is always embedded in systems of domination which simultaneously
support and threaten it; while the latter needs the former to fulfil a wide range of
administrative, technical and organizational functions, there is always the danger
that it will ‘turn on’ its functionaries in ways that threaten their legitimacy. In
turn, once political and economic elites begin to ‘turn on’ expert authority, they
will do their best to ensure that ‘the people’ follow their lead, particularly when
wider conditions in the economy and polity encourage increasing public scepticism
and suspicion over the power that experts wield within their societies.
However open, participatory, reflexive and deliberative expert authority may
become, ‘they do not, by themselves, secure legitimacy’ (Eyal 2019: 145). Legitimacy
must be secured and renewed in a continuing struggle to retain its potency and
efficacy in which the power it authorizes and justifies has recognizable limits
but also supportive institutions and mechanisms that generate sufficient epistemo-
logical consensus and closure required ‘to move on’ in any sphere of contemporary
life. In short, expert authority must retain its freedom and capacity to challenge
the prevailing status quo and to protect itself against threats to its integrity and
credibility which cannot be guaranteed by simply widening its ‘participatory
reach’ or enhancing its ‘reflexive capacity’. As Turner (2014: 73) maintains, expert
authority – if it is to reproduce its social legitimacy and public trust – must retain
an institutional infrastructure and personal substructure that guarantees, how-
ever imperfectly and messily, the impersonality and integrity of expertise. It
must have the collective capacity to ensure that ‘the production of expert knowl-
edge is controlled through the indirect means of professional certification and rec-
ognition, as well as the concentration and control of opinion through methods of
peer review and evaluation that typically do not directly assess the truth or valid-
ity of expert claims, just their minimal professional adequacy.’
Only in this way can expert authority ensure that it retains the wider public
support and trust it especially needs when those in positions of power within dom-
ination systems ‘turn against it’ and try to recruit the general populous to their
‘ideological drumbeat’. It must constantly revivify the core institutions and mech-
anisms on which its legitimacy rests if it is to retain sufficient public trust and sup-
204
Chapter 8: Towards a News Social Contract

port when its integrity and relevance are under extreme ideological and political
pressure. This will necessarily entail retaining limits on how participative and
open it becomes to wider influences and demands.
Currently, the ‘politicization of expertise’ constitutes as much of a threat to the
legitimacy of expert authority as the ‘technologization of politics’ in that it negates
whatever protestations experts might make against claims that they are simply
‘servants of power’ with little or no regard for the communities they are expected
to serve. Once expert authority is seen to be irrevocably compromised by the hier-
archies and networks of political power in which it is inevitably intermeshed, then
its corrosive impact on its internal integrity and external status is likely to become
irreparable. Only by maintaining a flexible and shifting balance between ‘trust and
control’ relations within a dynamic institutional landscape can expert authority ex-
pect to retain the legitimacy and trust on which its veracity and viability depends.
Contestation and instability, both internal and external, are inherent within such a
dynamic process and relationship; they cannot be contained and stabilized within
certification ecosystems and credentialled regulations however formalized and en-
trenched they may seem from the inside. Ultimately, it is this endemic dynamism
and flexibility which will save expert authority from the twin threats of bureau-
cratic ossification and political imperialism which many of its friends refuse to
admit much less contemplate.
5 Conclusion
Throughout this book we have focused on how ongoing debates about expert au-
thority have fused to form an intellectual crucible in which so many of the struc-
tural and political tensions which have defined the last half century or so have in-
termixed to produce all sorts of ‘strange and wonderful’ alloys.
Thus, the tensions between globalism and nationalism, liberalism and popu-
lism, pluralism and authoritarianism, science and tradition, meritocracy and com-
munity, and planning and markets have coursed their way through the crucible of
‘expert authority’ as it attempted to capture something vital about the times we
are living through. These have been, indeed are, times in which crises and crisis
narratives have been pervasive and somewhat overwhelming. While not underes-
timating the scale and significance of these crises, we have also attempted to nav-
igate an intellectual course between dystopian visions of ‘digitalised Taylorism’ or
‘surveillance capitalism’ or ‘technocratic authoritarianism’ on the one hand and
complacent narratives about ‘resilient certification ecosystems’ or ‘refurbished
meritocracy’ on the other.
5 Conclusion
205

Along the way, we have also tried to make a case for a ‘reflexive expert author-
ity and governance’ which recognizes the need for more open, participative and
deliberative modes of policy making and implementation but also remains firm
in the belief that ‘expertise’ must remain true to itself, and resist attempts to de-
mocratize it in ways that rob it of its own ‘machineries for producing legitimacy’
(Eyal 2019: 148). Expertise cannot and should not be collapsed into politics, both for
its own sake and for the sake of those whom it may serve. As Eyal (2019: 149) also
concludes, in sympathy with Weber, the most important role that experts serve is
as ‘bringers of bad news’ to both political and economic elites and the wider polity.
They must act with an ‘ethic of responsibility’ as their guiding principle where the
recognition of inconvenient facts, particularly in crisis situations where states,
experts, and publics have a lot of ‘skin in the game’, may prove very difficult
for all decision-makers and stakeholders to admit. As Owen and Strong (2004:
xxxi–xxxii emphasis in original) remark in their introduction to ‘The Vocation
Lectures’, ‘Weber argues that science does have an important ethical role to play
within the totality of human life, namely, to provide clarity concerning “ultimate”
problems [and] must operate against the background assumption that there is a
plurality of incompatible orientations to life’. Considered in this way, expert au-
thority – whether of the scientist, medic, academic, architect, lawyer, administra-
tor or manager – consists in legitimate claims to specialist knowledge and skills
with their own internal integrity and responsibility to be ‘bringers of bad news’
in a world where a plurality of incompatible values and interests bely any attempt
to produce universal agreement and certainty.
Expert authority is much more than certificates, licences and regulations but it
must retain its own distinctive organizational forms and regulative structures if it
is to remain in a position where it can at least question and even challenge power
elites based on its own internal values and the wider obligations they entail. Ex-
pert authority, at its organizational and discursive core, is about legitimating spe-
cialized knowledge and the critical role it must continue to play in our lives in
general and particularly in high risk, high stakes decision-making. ‘We’ cannot
do without it, and ‘it’ cannot do without us, but the relationship in which we
are jointly engaged will always be prone to conflict, tension and breakdown that
will require repair, compromise and consolidation.
In this final chapter, we have argued that the re-emergence of the ‘inter-
ventionist state’ (Tooze 2022; Cooper and Szreter 2021; Gerbaudo 2021; Garrard
2022), ideologically and politically nourished by a new ‘social contract’ reviving
and realigning the tripartite partnership between states, experts, and publics pre-
vailing under liberal/social democratic regimes (Shafik 2021; Hennessy 2021), con-
stitutes a major structural change likely to transform the governmental context in
which experts will operate. As a response to a series of crises, in which the global
206
Chapter 8: Towards a News Social Contract

pandemic has, at least so far, played the critical role, the re-emergence of an inter-
ventionist state, ideologically driven neither by neoliberalism or populism but by a
rejuvenated ‘collectivist individualism’ (Cooper and Szreter 2021), offers experts a
very real opportunity to re-establish their high trust relationship with the general
public and to renew their authority within the wider polity. Not only this, but the
return of the ‘interventionist state’ also offers the opportunity to restate the cen-
trality of ‘the public good’ in our lives and the key part that reflexive expert au-
thority will play in making that collective concern a political reality. Expert legiti-
macy struggles will continue to emerge and ebb and flow around the three core
purposes which the modern state fulfils, and which have become even more
self-evident in the aftermath of the series of crises which the world has faced
since 2008 – ‘security, welfare and democratic control of both politics and the econ-
omy’ (Garrard 2022: 175). Keeping its people safe, securing and promoting their so-
cial and economic wellbeing by actively engaging with powerful corporations in
order to ensure that they, alongside public agencies, provide essential public
goods to all its citizens by ‘reversing the policies of privatization and outsourcing
that has transferred so many of the functions of the state to the market (Garrard
2022: 184), and rebalancing of public and private power in favour of the former
constitutes the priorities for a revived liberal/social democratic state. In all of
this, experts will provide the specialist knowledges and skills required to make
the ‘public interest state’ a political reality and will seek to re-establish their legit-
imate authority based on how they will be judged by states and publics alike in
helping to realize this transformation in our collective and individual lives.
Expert authority has always been made and remade through struggles over its
legitimacy (Kennedy 2016) and will continue to be so. However, it relies on suffi-
ciently robust sources and mechanisms of ‘countervailing power’ (Galbraith
1967; Reich 2016) which have been severely weakened during the socio-historical
period covered in this book. Along with the return of the liberal/social democratic
state, experts will remain a vital source of power and authority interacting with
other sources of countervailing power within a pluralistic socio-political order
in which private interests are counterbalanced by public agencies. However, they
will only be able to do so if they are prepared to respond to the challenges
which much more reflexive modes of expert authority and governance demand.
Insofar as this book can make a contribution to social democratic revival and
the renewal of the countervailing power mechanisms and relations on which it de-
pends through an analysis of ongoing debates about ‘expert authority’ helping us to
interpret it in a more socially and politically realistic light, then it will have done
its job.
