Supervisor’s Foreword
A challengeable and rewarding Ph.D. quest should be involved in a topic that is in a
cutting-edge research ﬁeld with great potential for facilitating the leap beyond
current understanding. Recent decades have witnessed the accelerative and
impressive progresses on digital computer, while they are still suffered from high
energy consumption and low efﬁciency in dealing with unstructured problems.
Building an electronic brain is daunting but would evoke new computing paradigms
that should complement and/or propose alternative solutions to the classical Von
Neumann/CMOS association. The reemerged attention on neuromorphic engi-
neering that beneﬁt from recent innovative nanotechnologies has motivated Wan
Changjin, to develop transistor-based synaptic devices for synaptic emulations and
to explore the possibility of neuromorphic computing applications by exploiting
them.
Transistors, especially the electric-double-layer (EDL) transistors possess several
advantages as a candidate for building an electronic brain, for example the con-
nectivity. Such transistors could integrate multiple inputs through ionic coupling
evoking a conductance change through the channel, which is inherently similar to
the neurons with massive dendritic terminals. Before fully utilize these properties,
good understanding on the EDL electrostatic coupling as well as electrochemical
properties that underlie synaptic emulations should be studied. This thesis thus
could be divided into two main parts—mechanism studies and applications rooted
on them. In the ﬁrst part, several of synaptic behaviors involved in memory and
learning have been mimicked, which also propel the modeling of synapse-like
behaviors rooted in the classical theory of EDL transistors. In the second part,
several neuromorphic computing functions were realized such as dendritic inte-
gration, neural arithmetic, and orientation tuning.
In general, Changjin’s thesis opens several new chapters in the exploration of
neuromorphic engineering by exploiting oxide-based EDL transistors. All the phe-
nomena, characterizations and the methodologies are carefully described in the
ix

thesis. It’s no doubt that this thesis will serve a useful reference both for established
researchers and graduate students working in this cutting-edge area of modern
research.

Supervisor’s Foreword

Abstract
Human brain has a massively parallel and reconﬁgurable architecture with a
complex network of *1011 neurons and *1015 synapses. Such architecture makes
possible more robust, plastic and fault-tolerant learning/memory functions than any
current digital computer. In the neural network, the neuron that receives spike
inputs from thousands of synapses distributed across dendritic trees is often con-
sidered to be the computational engine of the brain. Synaptic plasticity is the
biological process by which speciﬁc patterns of synaptic activity result in changes
in synaptic strength and is thought to contribute to learning and memory. Therefore,
emulation of essential synaptic plasticity and computation are viewed as a key step
toward neuromorphic computing. Recently, synaptic electronics which is aimed at
capturing synaptic plasticity and computing power by single electronic device has
aroused widely interesting. At the outset, two-terminal devices such as memristors,
phase change memory, and atom switches, etc, have been explored as the building
blocks of neuromorphic systems. More recently, three-terminal neuromorphic
devices such as ionic/electronic hybrid transistors and ferroelectric transistors have
been demonstrated in the pursuit of the synaptic plasticity and computation in a
single device. The reported three terminal neuromorphic devices reveal alternative
potentials in acting more than a weight tunable connection, which can perform
signal processing/computing serving as synaptic ﬁlter, integrator, etc., in neuro-
morphic circuits. The ion-coupled oxide-based electric-double-layer (EDL) tran-
sistors are intrinsically equivalent to the ionic/electronic hybrid transistors, which
could be applied to tune the conducting characteristics of the semiconducting
channel in short-term and long-term, respectively, due to the ion/electron-correlated
electrostatic coupling and electrochemical processes. On this basis, this thesis
focused on the essential synaptic plasticity emulations and neuromorphic com-
puting applications by the ion-coupled oxide-based EDL transistors. The main
content can be summarized from the following aspects:
(1) Preparation and electrical performance research of electrolytes. In this thesis,
nanogranular SiO2, methylcellulose, and graphene oxide were successively
prepared. All of the electrolytes exhibit perfect insulativity. For example the
xi

maximum leakage current for the nanogranular SiO2 is as low as 0.6 nA.
What’s more, all of the electrolytes are good proton conducting ﬁlms. The
highest proton conductivity of 4.2  10−4 S/cm was obtained from methyl-
cellulose ﬁlms. These results indicate the electrolytes are perfect platform for
formation of EDL. Huge EDL capacitances >1 lF/cm2 were observed and the
highest capacitance was measured to 18 lF/cm2 in graphene oxide.
(2) Fabrication and performance characterization of oxide-based EDL transistors.
Oxide-based EDL transistors were fabricated by using the electrolytes men-
tioned in (1) as the gate dielectric. Good transistor performances were achieved
with ﬁeld-effect mobility higher than 20 cm2 V−1 s−1. The on–off ratio and
subthreshold slope of the oxide-based EDL transistors gated by nanogranular
SiO2 are 2  107 and 114 mV/decade, respectively. The fabrication processes
of the oxide-based EDL transistors gated by Nanogranular SiO2 are compatible
with the CMOS technologies, which indicate that such transistors can have the
great potentials for building neuromorphic circuits/chips. The transistors gated
by graphene oxide or methylcellulose exhibit good transistor performance.
Such transistors deposited on ﬂexible substrates are also demonstrated with
perfect mechanical ﬂexibility. No appreciable degeneration in performance can
be observed in the ﬂexible graphene oxide gated oxide-based EDL transistors
even after bending test for thousands times. In that case, such transistors could
potential applied for large scale ﬂexible neuromorphic circuits.
(3) The short-term behaviors of synapse were successfully mimicked. These
short-term behaviors are excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC), paired-pulse
facilitation (PPF), spatiotemporal correlated dynamic logic, and short-term
memory. What’s more, a theoretical model for short-term synaptic behaviors
emulations based on EDL modulation and stretched-exponential decay function
was proposed. Such model is consistent well with the experimental results. As
the theoretical model is not limited to the EDL transistors mentioned before,
our results will provide a useful guideline for short-term emulations of other
ion-coupled EDL transistors.
(4) The long-term behaviors of synapse were successfully mimicked. The elec-
trochemical doping/dedoping processes between protons in electrolyte and
electrons in semiconducting channel can be observed under a high gate voltage
(|V| > 4.0 V). The XPS measurements indicate that the oxygen vacancies in
IZO were increased by the electrochemical doping process, which results in a
long-term increase in channel conductance. On the contrary, the electrochem-
ical dedoping process would result in a long-term decrease in channel con-
ductance. On this basis, the long-term behaviors such as spike-timing-
dependent plasticity (STDP), long-term memory, and classical conditioning,
were successfully mimicked.
(5) Dendrite related functions were successfully realized. The huge EDL capaci-
tance is formed at the interface between electrolyte and channel function as a
nanoscale capacitor. Almost all the gate voltage is applied on such capacitor
with nearly no potential difference across the electrolyte. Therefore, multiple
gate inputs could paralleled coupled to channel. Nonlinear dendritic integration

functions were realized, which is very similar to the biological experiments.
What’s more, the neural arithmetic behaviors were successfully mimicked by
using additional gate electrode as the modulatory input.
(6) Visual processing functions were successfully realized. In analogy to the
structure of visual neural network, an artiﬁcial visual system was built based on
oxide-based EDL transistors. Such visual system shows selectivity in response
to edge orientations around zero degree. The orientation tuning function can be
realized with a full width at half maximum of 44.5°. Then the collision
avoidance behaviors of LGMD neuron were successfully realized based on an
artiﬁcial visual system with 20  20 photodetectors and multiple-gate
oxide-based EDL transistors.

Introduction
1.1
Background
The human brain is a massively parallel and reconﬁgurable neural network with
~1011 neurons and ~1015 synapses and operates at a ultralow energy consumption
(<20 W), which is much more robust, plastic, and error-tolerant than any digital com-
puter [1–3]. There are two dominant merits of human brain when compared with dig-
ital computer: (1) massive parallel in structrurally; (2) highly plastic in functionally.
Few decades ago, Carver Mead conceptually proposed the so called neuromorphic
engineering [4]. Neuormorphic engineering is aimed at developing nonbiological
systems that resemble the essential merits of brain, in order to achieve self-learning
and self-cognition computers with ultralow energy consumption ultimately. To real-
ize neuromorphic computing, software and hardware-based approaches have been
proposed. For the former, it’s reported that the IBM team has to employ Blue Gene/P
(BG/P), a super computer equipped with 147 456 CPUs and 144 TB of main mem-
ory, to perform certain cortical simulations at the cat scale even at ~100 times slower
ﬁring rate [5]. It is because the algorithm is essentially run by conventional sequen-
tial machines with limited parallelism for software-based approach. In that case, to
realize neuromorphic computing by using much less resource is considered as a sig-
niﬁcant challenge. Hardware-based approach that physically achieves the massively
parallelism and highly plasticity as the human brain may potentially overcome this
challenge.
Neuron is the basic unit of memory and processing in the brain, and neurons
connect to each other through synapses. Thus, realization of physical devices with
synaptic/neural functions is of great interesting for hardware implementation of the
neuromorphic computation system. Therefore, synaptic electronics [6], a hardware
based approach, has been proposed, which is aimed at developing electronic devices
to capture the essential synaptic plasticity and computing powers. Up to now, a
broad spectrum of electronic devices have been proposed, including two-terminal
synaptic devices such as atom switch, memristor, and phase change memory, and

Introduction
three-terminal synaptic devices such as electric-double-layer transistors (EDLTs)
and ferroelectric-gate ﬁeld-effect transistor (FeFET) [7–23]. Thanks to the achieve-
ments on these synaptic devices, synaptic plasticity such as paired-pulse facilitation
(PPF) and spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), and neuromorphic computing
such as spatiotemporal correlated dynamic logic and pattern recognition, have been
successfully mimicked [7–23].
EDLTs, also called electrolyte-gated transistors (EGTs), are very promising
among various synaptic devices. Previous research on EDLTs spans a spectrum of
issues including ﬂexible electronics, printed electronics and biosensors [24–29]. By
applying a voltage to the gate electrode, the migration and accumulation of ions could
be observed at the gate-electrolyte and semiconductor-electrolyte interfaces, which
will induce the electric-double-layer (EDL) at these interfaces [30–32]. Importantly,
the thickness of the EDL is very small (~1 nm), thus the EDL capacitance could
be very large (>1 μF/cm2). In that case, such type transistor could electrostatically
induce a very high density of carrier (>1014/cm2) in the semiconductor channel at a
very low voltage (normally below 3 V). Furthermore, if the semiconducting channel
is permeable, the ions in electrolyte could penetrate into the channel under a relative
high gate voltage, known as the electrochemical doping process [29]. On the con-
trary, we called the electrochemical dedoping process as the return of the ions under
reversed electric-ﬁeld.
The EDL electrostatic coupling shows a volatile manner and the electrochemi-
cal processes show a nonvolatile manner, which have been proved with the resem-
blance to short-term plasticity (STP) [33, 34] and long-term plasticity (LTP) [15,
16, 23], respectively. More interestingly, transistor-type synaptic devices possess
several merits than two-terminal synaptic devices due to their three-terminal struc-
ture and capacitive coupling working mode. For example, (1) these devices enable
concurrent learning without stopping signal transmission; (2) the synaptic behav-
ior modulation and energy consumption reduction are available by adding another
gate electrodes; (3) artiﬁcial neural network could be realized without hard-wired
based on the capacitive coupling [20, 21]. Therefore, EDLTs is of great interesting
in neuromorphic engineering.
This work will start from studies on a series of electrolyte materials and the EDLTs
performance based on these materials. More importantly, synaptic emulations and
neuromorphic computing applications will be discussed based on these EDLTs.

devices [35]. Later on, Chao et al. fabricated microelectrochemical transistors that
were employed to amplify small chemical signals and to explore the dependence of
conductivity on electrochemical potential, which could be deemed as the foundation
of EDLTs [36, 37]. Nowadays, EDLTs have drawn a world-wide attention and were
endowed with variety of names [32, 38–43], including electrolyte-gated transistors
(EGTs), organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs), ion-sensitive ﬁeld-effect tran-
sistors (ISFETs), and hygroscopic insulator ﬁeld-effect transistors (HIFETs). In this
work, such type of transistors was uniformly named electric-double-layer transistors
(EDLTs).
The utilization of electrolyte is based on two dominant advantages than conven-
tional gate dielectric materials: (1) the huge EDL capacitance and (2) the low tem-
perature fabrication process. Conventional gate dielectric materials, e.g. the SiO2
obtained by thermal oxidation, are good insulator for both electron and ion. The
capacitance between gate electrode and channel could be equivalent to parallel plate
capacitor, the speciﬁc capacitance is estimated by the equation: Ci ε0εr/d, where
ε0, εr, and d are the vacuum permittivity, relative dielectric constant, and thickness
of the dielectric layer, respectively. Therefore, decreasing the thickness or using
high dielectric constant (high-κ) dielectric materials could signiﬁcantly increase the
speciﬁc capacitance. However, simply decreasing the thickness will increase the
leakage current through the dielectric layer. The operation voltage could be effec-
tively decrease to a low value (≥3 V) by using high-κ dielectric materials such as
zirconia (ZrO2) and titanium silicate (TiSiO2) [44, 45]. While, it’s still a big chal-
lenge to further increase the speciﬁc capacitance. What’s more, the high-temperature
annealing process is always needed for the fabrication of high-κ dielectric materials,
which limits the applications in ﬂexible electronics, printed electronics and so on.
Ideally, electrolyte is an ionic conducting and electronic insulating material. The
removable ions in electrolyte can drift along the electric ﬁeld and form a dense
electric-double-layer at the electrode/electrolyte interface [30–32]. The schematic
diagram of the EDL structure is shown in Fig. 1.1. At the electrolyte side, ions are
distributed in compact layer and diffuse layer, and the potential drop is mostly applied
on the Helmholtz Plane with thickness of ~1 nm. Such thickness thus enable a huge
speciﬁc capacitance of ~1 to 500 μF/cm2. The ions at the interfaces screen the carriers
with opposite polarity and same concentration in the metal or semiconductor side.
Such strong electrostatic coupling effect could achieve a very high carrier density
of >1014 cm−2 and induce a very large electric ﬁeld intensity of >1 × 106 V cm−2
[29]. What’s more, most electrolyte materials for gate dielectric could be obtained
at room temperature, e.g. using solution process, which is very suitable for printed
electronics, ﬂexible electronics, and bioelectronics applications [24, 29, 45–51].
1.2.2
Basic Principle of EDL Transistors
EDLTs are one type of ﬁeld-effect transistors (FETs) [52]. The switch effect of FETs
is realized by the tuning of channel carrier concentration or conductivity. By applying

a voltage which vertical to the semiconducting channel, the channel conductivity
could be capacitively modulated through the gate/dielectric/channel capacitor. The
FETs could be divided into N-type and P-type based on the carrier type of the
semiconducting channel (electron for N-type and hole for P-type). In this book, the
N-type FETs are used as the example for working principle demonstration of FETs.
ThereareseveralimportantparametersforFETssuchastheturn-onvoltage(VON),
threshold voltage (VTH), ON–OFF current ratio (ION/IOFF), subthreshold slope (SS)
and carrier mobility (μ). The precise and detailed deﬁnitions of these parameters
will not provide in this book and we simply introduce some essential theories about
the FETs.
We deﬁned the relationship between channel current (IDS) and swept gate voltage
(VGS) with a constant drain voltage (VDS) as transfer characteristics, and the rela-
tionship between channel current and swept drain voltage (VGS) with different gate
voltage (VGS) as the output characteristics. Figure 1.2 shows the curve for transfer
characteristics (a) and output characteristics (b), respectively.
We ﬁrstly discuss the transfer characteristics of FETs. When the applied gate volt-
age (VGS) is lower than turn-on voltage (VON), the carriers are completely depleted,
which induce a very low channel current. In that case, the transistor is on its off
state. When the applied gate voltage is larger than turn-on voltage and lower than the
threshold voltage (VON < VGS < VTH), the channel can be induced a small number
of carrier, and the IDS at this state is called subthreshold current. At the subthreshold
region, current is dominantly induced by the diffusion of carriers, thus the IDS and
VGS show an exponential relationship:

where, κB and T are Boltzmann Constant and absolute temperature, respectively.
When the applied gate voltage is larger than the threshold voltage, the carriers in
channel could be induced and accumulated. Then a positive drain-to-source voltage
(VDS) will induce a channel current which is similar to applying a voltage on a
resistor. In that case, the IDS is in proportion to VDS, and we call this current region
as linear region. The IDS and VDS thus yield the following equation:
IDS  WCiμ
L
(VGS −VTH)VDS
(1.2)
where, W, L, Ci, and μ are the channel width, channel length, speciﬁc capacitance
of the gate dielectric, and the ﬁeld-effect mobility, respectively.
The potential drop between drain and gate will decrease with the increase of VDS.
Therefore, when the VDS reach saturation voltage (VDsat), the carrier induced by the
gate voltage will be depleted near the drain electrode side. After that, even the VDS
increase to a value larger than VDsat, the current would be almost constant. We deﬁne
this region as saturation region and the transition point as pinch-off point. The IDS
versus VDS yield the following equation:
IDS  WCiμsat
2L
(VGS −Vth)2
(1.3)
where μsat is the carrier mobility at the saturation region. This parameter is a very
important criterion for transistor performance.

Introduction
Based on the description above, we summarize the essential tips which would be
used in later chapters [52].
a. The turn-on voltage is deﬁned by the voltage when IDS in logarithmic coordinates
signiﬁcantly increases or the FETs are just completed turned off.
b. The threshold voltage is deﬁned by the lowest voltage for the formation of carrier
accumulation layer at the interface between gate dielectric and channel.
c. The current ON/OFF ratio is deﬁned by the ratio between the ON state current
and OFF state current.
d. The subthreshold slope is the slope of the transfer curve in the plot of logarithmic
at the subthreshold region, which can be calculated by SS  ( dlogIDS
dVGS |max)−1.
e. The carrier mobility is the carrier drift velocity under a unit electric ﬁeld, which
characterizes how quickly an electron (hole) can move through a metal or semi-
conductor. The ﬁeld effect carrier mobility at saturation region is calculated by

There are two working modes for the EDLTs as shown in Fig. 1.3b. The ions in
electrolyte could be driven by electric ﬁeld and accumulate to the interface between
the channel and electrolyte. For the impenetrable semiconductors (Fig. 1.3b, left
panel), these ions screen the charges in the gate metal and cause accumulation of
carriers in the semiconductor channel formed a layer called the electric-double-layer
(EDL). At steady-state (quasi-static operation), the ionic current from the gate to
source electrodes is near zero ideally and potential drop is almost applied on the EDL
[29]. Such process could be described by the electrostatic modulation as mentioned
before.
While for the penetrable semiconductors, the EDL will form under a low gate
voltage, too. However, the ions could penetrated into the semiconducting channel
and induce carriers in the channel as dopant. Such process is termed electrochemical
doping. Such kind of transistors is also named as electrochemical transistors (ECTs)
[29, 35]. What’s more, when applied a reversed voltage, the ions could be driven out
of the channel, known as the electrochemical dedoping process. Such doping and
dedoping processes would induce a structural change of semiconductor, which may
modify the conducting property of the semiconductor [29, 34].

Gate Dielectric Materials and Applications of EDL
Transistors
The dielectric materials of EDLTs are generally polyelectrolyte [53, 54], ionic liq-
uids [55–57], ion gels [24, 58, 59], inorganic solid electrolytes [60–62], and so on.
One of the earliest studied polyelectrolyte is poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) doped with
a lithium salt (e.g., LiClO4) [63]. More recently, the ionic liquids and ion gels that
possess much higher ionic conductivity, become very promising candidates for EDLs
with high switching speed [55–57, 59]. Besides, ionic liquids and ion gels also exhibit

negligible volatility, non-ﬂammability, exceptional thermal, chemical and electro-
chemical stability. Therefore, these materials are also used as dielectric for abroad
spectrum of applications including dye-sensitized solar cells [64], electromechanical
actuators [65], lithium ion batteries [66], electrochemical capacitors [67]. The high
ionic conductivity is due to the weak electrostatic interaction between ions in the
electrolyte despite of the high ion concentration. Figure 1.4 show the transfer and
output characteristics of an ionic liquid gated organic transistor [58]. The ionic liquid
used in this transistors is polystyrene-poly(methyl methacrylate)-polystyrene (PS-
PMMA-PS). The speciﬁc capacitance and ionic mobility are estimated to 30 μF/cm2
and 10−3 S/cm, respectively. Such transistors thus show a high ON/OFF ratio of ~105
and high mobility of >1 cm2/(V s).
Nanogranular SiO2 is composed of solid nanoscale granular silicon dioxide
with hydrogen, which is deposited by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition
(PECVD) method using silane and oxide as reactant gases [60]. Such solid elec-
trolyte proposed by our group in 2009 possesses a high speciﬁc capacitance up to 30
μF/cm2 and high ionic conductivity within a range of 10−4 to 0−3 S/cm [60]. The
basic mechanism for ionic conductivity is due to the hoping of hydrogen ion between
hydrogen bonds, as shown in Fig. 1.5 [68].

Figure 1.6 shows the ionic conductivity range of some electrolytes. The polar-
ization speed or the EDL formation time of the electrolyte is related to the ionic
conductivity, which can dominate the switching frequency of the devices. Normally,
the polarization speed is higher than microsecond, thus the switching frequency of

the EDLTs is less than megahertz. In this case, the EDLTs is limited for some low fre-
quency applications such as printed electronics [24, 69], ﬂexible electronics [46–48,
50, 70, 71] and sensors [51, 72–75]. These applications will be demonstrated by
several EDLTs as follow.

EDLTs are also widely used in ﬂexible electronics. Figure 1.9 shows a ﬂexible MoS2
transistor gated by ionic gel [48]. The MoS2 active layer were deposited on Polyimide
substrate through chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method. The patterned nickel
electrodes serve as source, drain and gate, and the ionic gel (PS-PMMA-PS) as the
gate dielectric. The transfer curves of the transistor under bent (red line) and after
bent (blue line) were shown in Fig. 1.9b. Negligible degenerations could be observed.
Furthermore, the maximum drain currents and normalized mobility were also shows
a slight decay by increasing the curvature radius. Less than 10% changes could be
obtained when the curvature radius decrease from inﬁnite to 0.75 mm. Therefore,
such devices show very good ﬂexibility by using the electrolyte as the gate dielectric.

FET sensors are one of the most promising sensors, which have been widely used
for detection of biological small molecule, protein and DNA [72–75]. To obtain
the selectivity, the gate dielectric or electrodes of the EDLTs based sensors were
modiﬁed with selective layer. Figure 1.10 shows an ion-sensitive EDLT, in which the
gate electrodes were coated with an ionic selective functional ﬁlm [76]. Such ﬁlm is
very sensitive to potassium and calcium ions. A very low limit of detection (LOD)
of micromole level could be achieved as a result.

Introduction of Synapses and Their Behaviors
Our brain is a highly parallel, energy efﬁcient and event-driven information process-
ing system, which is fundamentally different from traditional von Neumann com-
puters. It is a complex and elaborate network, which is comprised of 1011 neurons
interconnected by 1015 synapses. The neuron structure is diagramed in Fig. 1.11.
A neuron typically consists of soma, dendrite and axon. Synaptic transmission is a
complex process which starts with the opening of voltage-gated calcium ion channels
by the external simulations. Ca2+ ions diffuse inside the neuron and cause synap-
tic vesicles to release neurotransmitters to the synaptic gap, known as the synapse.
Synapse is a ~20-nm-wide gap between the end of the axon and the next neuron’s

dendrite start (Fig. 1.12). Neurotransmitters then diffuse through the synapse and
bind to the receptor sites of Na+ gated ion channels at the post-synaptic neuron side.
Such process causes the receptor sites to open and allow the Na+ ions to diffuse
inside the postsynaptic neuron. The membrane potential of the postsynaptic neu-
ron becomes more positive and if it reaches a threshold, the neuron ﬁres an action
potential. We called the excitatory postsynaptic potential/current (EPSP/EPSC) as
the postsynaptic potential/current that makes the postsynaptic neuron more likely
to ﬁre an action potential. On the contrary, we called the inhibitory postsynaptic
potential/current (IPSP/IPSC) as the postsynaptic potential/current that makes the
postsynaptic neuron less likely to ﬁre an action potential [3]. The EPSC or IPSC
temporally last for 1 × 104 ms in a postsynaptic neuron, which enable the postsy-
naptic neuron to collectively process the currents to establish spatial and temporal
correlated functions.

Introduction
Fig. 1.13 The paired pulse
facilitation behavior
The neuron and synapse are the most basic computing components of brain. Neu-
ron integrates multiple signals from presynaptic neurons to generate action potentials
that modify the connection weight of the synapses. The modiﬁcation process is called
as synaptic plasticity, which underlies the memory and learning [3]. The synaptic
plasticity is often classiﬁed into three categories based on time scale: (1) short-term
plasticity (STP) lasts from few milliseconds to few minutes; (2) long term plasticity
(LTP) lasts from hours to eternal [77].
The paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) is a very important form of STP in which an
increased EPSC can be observed when the second spike closely follows a previous
spike [78]. As shown in Fig. 1.13, the EPSC amplitude (A2) triggered by the second
stimulus is higher than the EPSC amplitude (A1) triggered by the ﬁrst stimulus. We
deﬁne the facilitation ratio as the ratio between the two amplitudes (A2/A1). The
facilitation ratio decays with the time-interval between the two stimuli. The STP
is highly involved in many neural activities including short-term memory, temporal
information decoding, and so on [79, 80].
The long-term plasticity can be divided into two categories: long-term potentia-
tion (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). Figure 1.14 shows the LTP behaviors
observed in hippocampus of a E18–20 embryonic rats [82]. A train of paired-pulse
stimuli was applied at t ≈30 min. The mean value of EPSC increases from ~50 to
~100 pA were observed before and immediately after the applying of stimulation
train, respectively. After the train of stimuli, the EPSC shows a gradually decay man-
ner. However, the EPSC value remains larger than the baseline for more than 30 min.
In that case, the EPSC or the synaptic weight was long-term enhanced by the tetanic
stimulation.
As shown in Fig. 1.15b, Bi and Poo found the asymmetric STDP rule in which the
synaptic weight is dependent on the timing of the pre- and postsynaptic spikes [83]. If
the presynaptic spikes trigger prior to the postsynaptic spikes (t > 0), the synaptic
connection strength will be enhanced. On the contrary, if the presynaptic spikes

trigger posterior to the postsynaptic spikes (t < 0), the synaptic connection strength
will be weaken. The relative change in synaptic connection is dependent on the time
interval (t) between the spike pairs. In other words, the closer time interval, the
larger change in the synaptic connection could be found. What’s more, there is a time
window of ~100 ms for such behavior [83–85]. Latest studies have revealed various
forms of STDP as shown in Fig. 1.15c [83–85]. The ﬁring rate, spiking orders,
dendritic location, and cell/synapse type will greatly affect the plasticity [86]. Its
simplicity,biologicalplausibilityandcomputationalpower,makesSTDPgeneralized
as a mechanism which regulates the synaptic connection strength depending on their
spike timing. However, STDP is not the only form of plasticity let alone the only
cellular-levelcomputingmechanism.Evenso,STDPhasbeenwidelyinvestigatedfor
pattern recognition, temporal sequence learning, coincidence detection, navigation,
and direction selectivity.

Background of the Neuromorphic Devices
Traditional computer based on complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor transis-
tor (CMOS) and von Neumann architecture is believed to be the ideal tool for dealing
with structuring and well-deﬁned computations. However, even our best machines
struggle with tasks that interact with the real-world. The memory modules and com-
puting modules are separated in the traditional von Neumann machines, which may
limit the data transfer rate between the central processing unit (CPU) and memory
subject to the capacity of the data bus [87, 88]. On the other hand, and the efﬁciency
the von Neumann machine that works based on binary logics decreases dramatically
with the increasing of complexity. While, the human brain possess intrinsic different
architecture and properties compared with the computers: (1) massive paralleled, 3D
constructed and compact structure; (2) high energy efﬁciency; (3) integrated mem-

IBM reported a human-computer competition in 2011, which was carried out for
computational tasks involving mainly voice recognition, natural language process-
ing, information retrieval, and machine learning [89]. The supercomputer Watson
won the contest (Jeopardy) with the advantage of almost 40-fold difference in reac-
tion time to activate the buzzer. However, the results are not so proud considering
the energy consumption, physical sizes and so on. Watson has 2880 computing cores
and requires about 80 kW of power while human brain occupies less space than 2 L
and consumes of the order of 10 W [2].
At present, to achieve brain inspired computing or neuromorphic computing, there
are software-based and hardware-based approaches. The software-based approach
still works on the traditional sequence program machine with limited parallelism. In
that case, the implementation of neuromorphic computing with limited resource is
still a big challenge. Alternatively, hardware-based approaches that implement the
massive parallelism and high plasticity as the neural network at physical level pos-
sess the great potential for realization of neuromorphic comuting. However, to build
a brain-like system with 3D and compact structure is still out of reach. A critical
issue is the shortage of devices that could mimic the synapse or neuron behaviors.

1.3 Overview of Neuromorphic Devices

The impressive progresses in neurosciences have greatly shaped our understanding
on neuron and synapse, which also shed light on the importance of them in bio-
logical computation paradigm. Synapse is the 20–40 nm gap between neurons and
is responsible for transmission of electrical and chemical signals. Synapses as well
as neurons are the most abundant computing units. In that case, the realization of
artiﬁcial synapse or neuron would a step forward the massive paralleled computation.
Synaptic electronics is aimed at developing artiﬁcial synapses that capture the
essential computing power as the biological one. Few decades ago, the concept
to construct cognitive and adaptive artiﬁcial devices has already been proposed.
It’s not until 2008, renewed attention were paid on building a compact computing
system with ultralow energy consumption and high fault-tolerance as human brain
by the release of Darpa Synapse program [6]. From 2010, a series of novel electronic
devices including memristor, atomic switch, phase change memory, ion/electron
hybrid transistor, ferroelectric ﬁeld-effect transistor, etc., were developed for synaptic
emulations and neuromorphic computing. Hereinafter, the synaptic devices were
divided into two-terminal and three-terminal synaptic devices, respectively, based
on the terminal number of the device.
It should be noted that the synaptic devices mentioned in this book might mimic or
implement more complex functions than that of synapse, such as spatiotemporal inte-
gration, gain modulation, etc. Therefore, we redeﬁne these devices as neuromorphic
devices in this book.
1.3.2.2
Two-Terminal Synaptic Devices and Synaptic Emulation
Applications
Memristor is predicted by Prof. Leon Chua in 1971 as the fourth basic circuit element.
Memristor is deﬁned as any 2-terminal device obeying a state-dependent Ohm’s law
[90]. For a memristor, the input signals at a given moment only determine the time
derivative of the state variable, and the device state can be sufﬁciently determined
only after knowing the history of the inputs. In brief, the conductance of a memristor
can be modiﬁed by controlling charge or ﬂux through it. In that case, the memristor is
verysimilartobiologicalsynapsewherethesynapticweightbetweentwoneuronscan
be precisely adjusted by the ionic ﬂow through them. Therefore, the memristors were
intensively investigated for mimicking some essential synaptic behaviors involved
in memory, computing, learning and so on.
A memristor based on Si/Ag active layer was shown in Fig. 1.16 for synaptic
emulations, which is proposed by Prof. Lu’s group from University of Michigan [12].
The memristor consists of a layered device structure including a cosputtered Ag and
Si active layer with a properly designed Ag/Si mixture ratio gradient that leads to the
formation of a Ag-rich (high conductivity) region and a Ag-poor (low conductivity)
region (Fig. 1.16a). Under applied bias, the continuous motion of the conduction
front in the cosputtered memristor device replaces discrete, localized conducting
ﬁlamentformation,andtheconductionofthedevicethuscouldbetuned.Theartiﬁcial
synaptic network could be fabricated based on a cross-bar structure as shown in

Fig. 1.16b. The synaptic potentiating/depressing processes were mimicked through
applying continuous voltage pulses and using the conductance as the connection
strength (Fig. 1.16c). The conductance of the device increases with the number of
positive voltage pulses while decreases with the number of negative voltage pulses.
The important synaptic plasticity behavior—STDP, was mimicked based on such
conductance modulation mechanisms (Fig. 1.16d).
Atomic switch is a nanoionic device that controls the diffusion of metalions/atoms
and their reduction/oxidation processes in the switching operation to form/annihilate
a conductive path. The atomic switch is ﬁrstly proposed by Kazuya Terabe et al. in
2005 (Fig. 1.17) [91]. For fabrication processes, Ag2S-coated Ag wires are formed
ﬁrst by sulphurizing Ag wires. Then, a 1-nm-thick Ag layer is deposited on the
wires. Finally, Pt wires are formed across the Ag2S-coated Ag wires. In that case, the
switch is formed in the ON state. Then, the switch is turned off by applying a certain
positive bias voltage to the Pt electrode in order to drive Ag atoms to be ionized for
incorporating into the Ag2S crystal. The switch could be turned off again by applying
a negative voltage.

Since the formation and dissolution of metal bridge is atomized, the conductance
of this device is quantized with a unit of 2e2/h, where e and h are electron charge and
Planckconstant,respectively.In2011,TakeoOhnoetal.exploitedsuchatomicswitch
for long-term potentiation (LTP) and short-term plasticity (STP) emulations [10]. As
shown in Fig. 1.18, when voltage pulses with a lower repetition rate (T  20 s)
were applied, the switch did not maintain the higher-conductance state (77.5 μS).
The conductance decreases with time back to its initial low conductance value after
each pulse. This behavior could be analogous to the STP mechanism observed in
biological synapses. When voltage pulses with a shorter interval time (T  2 s) were
applied, a permanent transition to higher-conduction states is clearly observed with

repeated application of input pulses, successfully mimicking the LTP mechanism of
a biological synapse.
The switch performance of phase change memory (PCM) is achieved through
the transition of low conductance with amorphous phase and high conductance with
polycrystalline phase. When local joule heat generated by the applied voltage is high
enough to induce the phase change, the conductance of the device would be changed
in turn. In 2011, Duygu Kuzum et al. proposed a two-terminal synaptic device based
on Ge2Sb2Te5 (GST) phase change memory, and the synaptic emulations including
symmetrical and asymmetrical forms of STDP were successfully mimicked [13]. The
conductance of the device could be gradually tuned by the amplitude and width of the
voltage applied between the top and bottom electrodes. The different forms of STDP
could be mimicked through applying series of programmed pre- and postsynaptic
spikes as in nervous system. As shown in Fig. 1.19a, when the time interval between
the pre- and postsynaptic spikes is 0, the potential difference between the top and
bottom electrode of the device is not high enough to induce a phase change. By
varying the time intervals, the conductance of the device could be tuned dependent

forms of STDP could be obtained as shown in Fig. 1.19b.

Two-Terminal Synaptic Devices and Synaptic Emulation
Applications
The idea that links synapse and transistor together has been propose in the year of
1992, Shibata et al. [92] They proposed a new-concept neuron MOS transistor with
multiple input gates, and the summation of gate voltage signals could be carried
out by the charge sharing among multiple gate capacitors. In that case, the multiple
gates of such transistors could be analogous to the dendrite of neuron. However,
they only demonstrated some possible traditional applications such as inverter and
digital analog converter. The ﬁrst transistor for synapse emulations could be dated
back to 1996. Carver Mead et al. proposed a Si-based ﬂoating gate transistor for
mimicking synaptic behaviors [93]. Based on hot electron injection and tunneling,
the transistor could generate analog neural impulse with a low energy consumption
of ~10−8 J/spike. Furthermore, 2 × 2 array was built on this device and the array was
demonstrated with analog computation and memory functions.
In 2010, Chen Yong et al. from University of California, Los Angeles designed
and fabricated a silicon-based synaptic transistor gated by ionic/electronic hybrid
materials [8]. As shown in Fig. 1.20a, the active layer of such transistor is p-doped
Si coated with a layer of thin SiO2 insulator. The MEH-PPH polymer and RbAg4I5
ionic conductor were coated onto the SiO2, respectively. When the device is applied
with voltage, the RbAg4I5 served as ion source which could provide mobile Ag+
and I−ions to inject into or pull out from MEH-PPH polymer. After that, residual
ions still exist in the polymer, which could remain the conductance change for a

long time. The polarity and concentration of the residual ions could be tuned by the
programmable voltage pulse, which could be analogous to the synaptic plasticity.
The STDP behavior has been mimicked based on such mechanism.
Almost at the same time in 2010, Alibart et al. designed and fabricated a nanopar-
ticle organic memory ﬁeld-effect transistor (NOMFET) for synaptic short-term plas-
ticity emulations, as shown in Fig. 1.21a [11]. The Au nanoparticles were demon-
strated with the capability for ion storage just as the polymer in previous example.
In this work, the voltage between drain and source (VDS) was deﬁned as the input
and the drain current (IDS) was deﬁned as the output. By applying a negative gate
voltage, holes would be induced at the surface of p-type pentacene and image charges
(electron) would be induced in the Au nanoparticles. Residual charges would exist
in the nanoparticles and decrease the channel conductance in turn. Therefore, by
applying successive negative voltage pulses, the current would increase as a result,
which could be analogous to the short-term potentiation (Fig. 1.21c).
Ferroelectric memory is nonvolatile memory based on some synthetic materials
like Pr(Zr, Ti)O3 (PZT) crystal. In 2012, Y. Nishitani et al. proposed a synaptic
transistor based on ZnO/PZT/SeRuO3 sandwiched structure (Fig. 1.22) [94]. The
channel conductance can be altered depending on the density of electrons induced
by the polarization of PZT ﬁlm. Applying a pulse gate voltage enables the multi-
valued modulation of the conductance, which is expected to be caused by a change
in PZT polarization. This variation depends on the height and the duration of the
pulse gate voltage and multilevel conductive state could be achieved. Symmetric
and asymmetric STDP learning functions are successfully mimicked based on such
ferroelectric synaptic devices based on these mechanisms.
In 2013, Jian Shi et al. proposed a SmNiO3 (SNO) based synaptic transistor [20].
Such SNO is a correlated electron system with insulator–metal transition temperature
at 130 °C in bulk form. The metallic phase resistance of SNO is very sensitive to
the stoichiometry. Oxygen vacancies could induce a transition between Ni3+ and
Ni2+: Ni3+ + e−↔Ni2+ (Fig. 1.23a), which increase the conductance of the device.
To get beneﬁt from such transition, Jian Shi et al. proposed ionic liquid-gated SNO

Introduction of Neuromorphic Computing
Recently, the realization of neuromorphic computing by synaptic devices has drawn a
worldwide attention. Generally, the analog memory is the key property of the synaptic
devices for implementation of neuromorphic computing. By applying biomimetic
strategies as observed in nerve system, neuromorphic computing could be achieved
such as iconic memory [95], orientation tuning [96], and pattern recognition [97].
In 2013, Shimeng Yu et al. proposed to mimic synaptic plasticity by
using
oxide
based
memristor
[17].
Such
devices
are
stacked
layers
of
Pt/HfOx/TiOx/HfOx/TiOx/TiN. Artiﬁcial visual cortex based on the memristor array
were designed and fabricated. Such network based on “winner takes all” consists of
two layer (Fig. 1.24a): (1) 32 × 32 optical sensors as presynaptic neuron; (2) 4 × 4
postsynaptic neuron. The optical sensors in ﬁrst layer convert the optical informa-

VCH
tion to voltage pulse and transmit to the second layer. The two layers were connected
together through 16,384 oxide based memristive synapse. The protocol for applying
voltage signals is shown in Fig. 1.24b. During each clock time, the second layer
would generate a voltage pulse (1.3 V, 10 ns) while the ﬁrst layer would generate
a voltage pulse dependent on the optical inputs. If the optical input is enough for
ﬁring, the ﬁrst layer neurons would generate a wide voltage pulse (0.6 V, 1 μs).
Therefore, when both the two layers are ﬁring, the voltage amplitude applied on
synapse is not higher than 0.7 V, which is unable to induce a conductance change
in the memristive synapse. On the contrary, if the ﬁrst layer is not ﬁring, the volt-
age applied on the synapse could be −1.3 V which is higher than the threshold for
inducing a conductance change through the memristive synapse. In other word, only
if the synaptic pixel received the light signal could result in resistance increment.
They applied a light signal with 0–180° orientations on the ﬁrst layer network for
training the artiﬁcial visual system. At ﬁrst, the initial distribution of the synaptic
weight in the second layer is shown in Fig. 1.25a, which is very randomly. The statis-
tical histogram of the initial distribution of the synaptic weight shows a very narrow
peak indicating the good uniformity (Fig. 1.25b, top). The middle and bottom panel
of Fig. 1.25b show the statistical histogram of synaptic weight after 200 and 1000
training processes, respectively. After 1000 epochs, the synaptic weight in the second
layer would possess the similar distribution as the oriented light signal (Fig. 1.25c).
Artiﬁcial neural networks (ANN) system is proposed around 1940s [98, 99].
An ANN consists of a collection of weight adjustable connected units or nodes
(called artiﬁcial neurons), which possess massive paralleled, distributed-processing,
self-organized and self-learning properties. Back propagation (BP) algorithm is a
supervised learning method based on ANN system, which is also called error back
propagation algorithm. In 2015, M. Prezioso et al. proposed to utilize memristor
based artiﬁcial neural networks for hardware implementation of BP algorithm [100].

Such network could be trained to divide a black-and-white picture with 3 × 3 pixels
into three categories based on delta rules. The memristor in this network is based on
binary-oxide Al2O3/TiO2−x stacks. The conductance of such device could be grad-
ually tuned by programmed voltage pulse applied on it. 12 × 12 crossbar structured
artiﬁcial synaptic arrays were fabricated with one single-layer perceptron. As shown
in Fig. 1.26a, b, the input layer consists of 10 pixels image. Each pixel was connected
to one artiﬁcial presynaptic neuron and each presynaptic neuron was connected with
three postsynaptic neurons through the memristor based synapse. Therefore, there
are 30 memristors were involved in the implementation of the algorithm.
Letters ‘z’, ‘v’, ‘n’ and these letters with a pixel of noise were displayed in
3 × 3 array (Fig. 1.26c). These patterns were used as the training/testing set for
implementing BP algorithm based on the proposed ANN system. The ﬂow chart of
executing the algorithm was shown in Fig. 1.26d. At ﬁrst, patterns from the training
set were applied, one by one, to the network’s input, and its outputs were used to

calculate the delta-rule weight increments. Then the difference between the output
and target value could be calculated. The differences were propagated back to the
input, which enable to modify the synaptic weights following Manhattan update rule.
Through several epochs training, the synaptic weights in the network could be tuned
close to desired value which could be able to recognize the category of the testing
pattern. The convergence results of the synaptic weights after 6 times of training were
shown in Fig. 1.27a, and the average learning epochs were estimated to 23 based on
these tests. The inset of Fig. 1.27a shows the statistical histogram of the synaptic
weight before and after training. The synaptic weights were tuned from uniformly to
more randomly by the training process. Figure 1.27b shows the output of the three
postsynaptic neurons in response to the three kind of pattern with different learning
epochs. Through training, the outputs were tuned close to the desired value gradually.
In other word, such single-layer perceptron are able to recognize the three patterns
ﬁnally.

Topic Basis
Synaptic electronics is a hardware approach for mimicing synapse behaviors, imple-
menting neuromorphic computing. The state-of-art of synaptic electronics is mainly
focused on developing of synaptic devices for realizing the aforementioned func-
tions. The synaptic devices consist of two-terminal-device like atomic switch, mem-
ristor, phase change memory, and three-terminal-device like electrolyte gated transis-
tors, ferroelectric transistor. Constructing large scale array by three-terminal-device
could avoid the sneak path problem that is pervasively existed in two-terminal-

device. What’s more, three-terminal-device could be feasibly extended to multiple
input/output wiring. Y. Nishitani et al. thought the signal transmission and synaptic
weight modiﬁcation could occur simultaneously on 3-terminal synaptic devices [94].
Therefore, the three-terminal structure of the synapse device enables the concurrent
learning. The comparison of signal transmission in 2-terminal and 3-terminal devices
(FeFET-based synapse), respectively, were shown in Fig. 1.28. In 2-terminal devices,
the signal transmission and weight modiﬁcation share the same path (Fig. 1.28a, b).
However, in 3-terminal devices, the signal transmits through the channel from source
to drain and the channel conductance is tuned by the voltage applied on gate. Based
on the two paths, the 3-terminal device enables the concurrent learning.
The channel conductance of oxide-based EDLTs could be tuned by EDL electro-
static modulation and electrochemical doping/dedoping, inducing volatile and non-
volatile changes, which has been demonstrated for mimicking synaptic plasticity.
Furthermore, such devices possess 3-terminal conﬁguration and capacitive coupling
working mode, which could be regarded as superiorities compared with 2-terminal
devices. For example, such device (1) enables concurrent learning; (2) could reduce
power consumption by adding a modulating gate electrode; (3) has the potential for
realizing hard-wired neural network based on capacitive coupling. In that case, the
EDLT is very promising in the area of synaptic emulation and neuromorphic com-
puting. This thesis is focused on design and fabrication of oxide-based EDLTs by
utilizing suitable materials, feasibility study for neuromorphic computing. This the-
sis thus would be of great interesting for constructing neuromorphic chip and even
system with artiﬁcial intelligence.

Introduction
EDLTs are widely used in the various ﬁelds such as ﬂexible electronics, biochemical
sensors and so forth. Recently, the application of using the EDLT in neuromorphic
engineering has been drawn more and more attention. For instance, Yong Chen
et al. used CNT ionic/electronic hybrid transistor structure and successful emulated
dynamic logic, learning, memory and other functions in biological synapses by uti-
lizing electrostatic coupling and electrochemical mechanisms of electrons in channel
and ions in electrolyte [1]. The unique double layer electrostatic modulation of EDLT
and electrochemical doped and de-doped in EDLT were demonstrated to be very sim-
ilar to STDP and LTP. Besides, 3-terminals transistor has some advantages than 2-
terminals synapse because of multiple terminals structure and capacitive coupling
working principle, such as (1) simultaneously proceeding with signals transmission
and self-learning; (2) the performance and power consumption of the synapses can
be modulated by adding additional gate electrodes; (3) build up hard-wired neural
network based on capacitive coupling working principle [2, 3].
The electrolytic thin ﬁlm of high electronic insulation and proton conduction is
a perfect platform for forming electric double layer. The electric ﬁeld can partially
break down hydrogen bonds and reconstruction them, so that the protons can transfer
along the electric ﬁeld direction, and ﬁnally accumulate at the interface between
electrode and electrolyte and form dense electric double layer. In recent research,
our group have observed the electric double layer in inorganic nanoparticle ﬁlm,
organic polymer ﬁlm and graphene oxide. Those electrolytic thin ﬁlms are easily
fabricated at room temperature with the superior performance such as low leakage
current (<20 nA) and high proton conductivity (>10−5 S/cm), which are appropriate
gate dielectric for dioxide EDLT.
Three types of the fabrication for aforementioned proton thin ﬁlm were introduced
in this chapter. Meantime, we characterized the thin ﬁlms in terms of materials and
electrical performance. Lastly, we characterized the performance of the EDLT which

Fabrication of Nanogranular SiO2 Electrolyte
SiO2 nanoparticles based electrolyte thin ﬁlm was prepared by PECVD.
The working principle of PECVD is using the plasma as energy resource at low
temperature and arc discharge. The deposition is achieved by introducing amount of
reactant gasses and raw gasses between parallel electrodes and excites the reactant

and O2. The Ar is chosen as inert gas. The relative chemical reaction is
SiH4 + O2 →SiO2 + H2O
The procedure in details are shown below
(1) Clean the substrate. The substrates are used in the experiment are (1) Trans-
parent conductive ITO glasses (25 mm × 25 mm × 2 mm) and (2) no-clean N
type Silicon with single polish (used for SEM). The clean procedure a) using
DI water (resistivity18 M cm) to clean the beaker; (b) Placing the ITO (or
wafer) into the beaker and pour the acetone into the beaker, ultrasonic clean for
10 min; (c) taking out the glass (or wafer) and pour out the acetone, add ethanol
(electronic grade) into the beaker and ultrasonic clean for another 10 min; (d)
using the tweeze to take out the glass (or wafer) and clean it by ﬂowing DI

(3) Placing the substrate. Put the ITO (or wafer) substrate on the sample holder
and close the chamber door.
(4) Vacuum the chamber. Set the parameter and open the roughing pump, waiting
for the chamber vacuum below base vacuum around 1.0 Pa, then open the
molecular drag pump to vacuum the chamber below 3 × 10−3 Pa.
(5) Vacuum the pipe. Open inlet valves for the Ar, O2 and SiH4/PH3 respectively,
and pump out the residual gas from the pipe by the molecular drag pump due
to the negative pressure from the chamber.
(6) Pre-heat the radio frequency (RF) power source. Open the RF power source

(10) Turn off equipment. (a) Molecular drag pump vacuum the chamber below the
base vacuum; (b) Close the molecular drag pump and the open the chamber
door to take out of the sample.
All the procedures above are fabrication process for preparing the SiO2 thin ﬁlm.
In order to test the electrical performance of SiO2 electrolyte thin ﬁlm, we deposited
a layer of metallic thin ﬁlm InZnO (IZO) on the phosphoric-doped SiO2 thin ﬁlm and
fabricated the sandwich structure of IZO/SiO2/ITO. The IZO electrode fabrication
will be present below by using the magnetron sputtering method.
The working principle of the magnetron sputtering is to produce high density
plasma by forming a closed-loop magnetic ﬁeld near the surface of the target. This
plasma is accelerated under the electrical ﬁeld and bombard the target so that the
atoms on the surface of target are knocked off from the crystal and deposit on the
substrate.
The magnetron sputtering deposition procedure of IZO is:
(1) Place samples. (a) Vent the chamber until the chamber pressure equal to atmo-
spheric pressure and open the chamber. (b) Put mask on the sample and place
them on the sample holder.
(2) Vacuum the chamber. (a) Close the chamber, open the rotary pump and angle
valve. (b) Open vacuum gauge and wait for it to be lower than 10 Pa and then
close the angle valve. (c) Open the molecular pump, then magnetron valve and
ﬁnally bafﬂe valve. The chamber is vacuumed under both molecular pump and
rotary pump.
(3) Ar inlet. Open the inlet gas gauge and wait for it to be 3 × 10−3 Pa, and then
open the Ar inlet. Controlling the Ar ﬂow rate to be 14 sccm and open the RF
power source for pre-heating.
(4) Start glow. (a) Adjust bafﬂe valve and wait for it to be around 2 Pa; (b) then RF
power source and set the power at 100 w; (c) adjust the reﬂection and minimize
it so that there is glowing generating near the target.
(5) Start sputtering. (a) Open the bafﬂe valve to keep the chamber pressure stabilized
at around 0.5 Pa. (b) Pre-sputtering for few minutes and then open the sample
bafﬂe to start the deposition for 15 min.
(6) Stop sputtering. (a) When deposition time is up, turn off the RF power source
and then close the Ar gas ﬂow rate gauge and the gas inlet; (b) open the bafﬂe
valve to maximum to pump out the residual gas from the chamber; (c) wait
for 10 min, close the bafﬂe valve and molecular pump; (d) when the molecular
pump stop running, close the magnetron valve.
(7) Take out of the sample. (a) Open the outlet gas valve so that the chamber
pressure reach the atmospheric pressure; (b) Open the chamber and take out of
the sample; (c) close the chamber and pump down the chamber below to 10 pa
by rotary (roughing) pump and close the rotary pump and angle valve.
After Hall measurement, the IZO hall mobility is 32 cm2/V s. The carrier density
for IZO with thickness of 30 and 150 nm are 8.83 × 1019/cm3 and 9.45 × 1019/cm3,
respectively, and the square resistance are 680 and 120 /sq.

2.3.2
Characterizations of Nanogranular SiO2 Electrolyte
Firstly, we analyzed the microstructure of P-doped SiO2 electrolyte thin ﬁlms, which
were deposited by the PECVD at room temperature. The cross section SEM of SiO2
thin ﬁlm on the silicon was shown in Fig. 2.1a. According to the 80 k magniﬁcation,
we can calculate the deposition thickness of SiO2 around 700 nm. The SEM image
showed that there was a loosely columnar structure within the thin ﬁlm. The TEM
of SiO2 deposited on the Cu grid was shown in Fig. 2.1b. From the TEM image, we
observed that the SiO2 thin ﬁlm with columnar structure was formed by accumulation
of SiO2 nanoparticle, which are loosely stacked with a lot of porous, resulting in a
porous SiO2 thin ﬁlm. The black region is SiO2 nanoparticle with diameter of around
10–20 nm, whereas the white region is gap between nanoparticle.
The AFM image of SiO2 thin ﬁlm with scan area 5 μm × 5 μm is shown in
Fig. 2.1c. There are no obvious cracks, porosities or other macroscopic defects on the
surface of the thin ﬁlm. Further analysis showed that the surface average roughness
is only 2 nm, indicating that the thin ﬁlm is very ﬂat which facilitate the fabrication of
device. Since we use SiH4 and O2 as the raw reactant gasses in the PECVD, which is
not a common way by using the SiH4 and N2O, the chemical reaction is very violent

The speciﬁc capacitance and phase angle plotted as function of testing frequency
in the chamber. With the aid of the plasma in the room temperature, the SiO2 were
able to form the nanoparticles. Due to the violent reaction from the SiH4 and O2, the
SiO2 had no sufﬁcient time to form dense thin ﬁlm; instead, it formed loose porous
SiO2 thin ﬁlm, which beneﬁted for humidity absorption from the air. The absorbed
water in SiO2 thin ﬁlm can be ionized into mobile H+ under the electrical ﬁeld, which
is similar to the conventional electrolyte, thereby the SiO2 thin ﬁlm is also called
SiO2 electrolyte thin ﬁlm.
Then, we characterized the electrical properties of P-doped SiO2 electrolyte thin
ﬁlm. The Cole-Cole of SiO2 electrolyte thin ﬁlm was shown in Fig. 2.2a. The mea-
sure condition of Cole-Cole is 60% (relatively humidity) and 300 K (environment
temperature). The measured samples of IZO/SiO2/ITO had a MIM sandwich struc-
ture as shown in Fig. 2.2a. From the graph, we can see the curve of Cole-Cole consist
of a half circle and a tail, which shows the polarization at the interface. According
the ionic conductivity formula σ 
L
A(R−R0), whereas the L is thickness of SiO2
electrolyte thin ﬁlm, which is 700 nm here; R is 176 , which is the curve at the
intercept of the real axis; R0 is the resistance of the equipment, which is 30 ; A is
the electrode area 1.5 × 10−3 cm2. The proton conductivity is calculated as high as
2 × 10−4 S/cm, which is 4 orders of magnitude higher than conventional SiO2 thin
ﬁlm fabricated by thermal oxide (~10−8 S/cm). This indicated that P-doped SiO2
electrolyte thin ﬁlm prepared by PECVD was an excellent proton conductivity ﬁlm,
which can generate mobile cations induced by the electrical ﬁeld.
Figure 2.2b showed the relationship between the speciﬁc capacitance, phase angle
and test frequency of SiO2 electrolyte thin ﬁlm. The test frequency change ranged
from 1 MHz to 1 Hz. Seen from the graph, the speciﬁc of SiO2 electrolyte thin ﬁlm
increased as the test frequency decrease. The speciﬁc capacitance of SiO2 electrolyte
thin ﬁlm is 4.6 μF/cm2 at~1 Hz the test frequency. Analyzed from the phase angle, it
showed the capacitance property at low and medium frequency (f < 0.12 MHz) and
phase angle smaller than −45° ( < −45°). This is because the mobile protons H+
in SiO2 electrolyte thin ﬁlm have enough time to diffuse into the interface between
SiO2/IZO and SiO2/ITO, which induced the electronic double layer (EDL) at the

nanoscale level of the thickness, as a result, the capacitance is large. At high frequency
(f > 0.12 MHz) and large phase angle ( > −45°), it showed the resistance property.
Because at high frequency, the response time is short and has no sufﬁcient time
for protons to move, few protons can accumulate at the interface of SiO2/IZO and
SiO2/ITO, as a result, it cannot form an electronic double layer (EDL) instead of
forming SiO2 capacitance. Therefore, the capacitance is small. All the testing results
above showed that SiO2 electrolyte thin ﬁlm is suited to work at the low frequency
which is compatible with the frequency range in the neural system.
The leakage current characteristics of P-doped electrolyte thin ﬁlm gated by
nanogranular SiO2 is shown in Fig. 2.3a. Scan gate voltage changed from −2.0
to 2.0 V, scan speed is 0.05 V/s, and keep the absolute leakage current of SiO2 elec-
trolyte thin ﬁlm below 0.6 nA. In the ionic conductive gate medium, gate leakage
current consists of electronic current and ionic current. At the slow scan speed, the
protons are fully hopped and protons are at quasi-static state, the leakage current
is mainly contributed from the electronic current; therefore, the leakage current is
small. The hopping mechanism of P-doped nanogranular SiO2 ﬁlm under applied
electric ﬁeld is shown in Fig. 2.3b [4]. To sum up, P-doped SiO2 thin ﬁlm is proton
conduction but electronic isolation thin ﬁlm, which is a good gate material and EDL
medium.

The detailed procedures refer to the Sect. 2.3.1
(3) Deposition of IZO electrode and channel
Placing a Nickle mask on the top of ITO with deposited SiO2 electrolyte gate
dielectric (as shown in Fig. 2.4). The Nickle mask with hollow size of 150 μm ×
1000 μm and the distance between the two adjacent hollow is 80 μm. The size of
drain-source in the mask is 150 μm × 1000 μm. The D indicates the distance between
gate and drain-source which is 300 μm, and the d indicate the distance between
drain and source which is 80 μm. During deposition process of IZO drain-source,
we can get the patterned electrode and self-assembled IZO channel by controlling
the distance between the mask and substrate. The channel is an IZO thin ﬁlm, which
is formed from IZO nanoparticles sputtered around the hollow of the mask by edge
diffusion. The obtained thickness of the gate, drain and source is about 150 nm while
the thinnest part is about 30 nm. The sheet resistance of IZO with thickness of 150
and 30 nm is 120 and 680 /sq, respectively. Therefore, these electrodes have high
conductivity with semi-conductive channels.
The output characteristics of the IZO EDLT gated by nanogranular SiO2 is shown
in Fig. 2.5a. VGS increases from −1.5 to 1.5 V, and change step is 0.25 V. The
characteristics of IDS show n-type channel properties obviously. When VDS increases
from 0 to 2.0 V, IDS increases linearly and then reaches the saturation. It indicates
the device has a good FET property. When VGS  1.5 V, VDS  2.0 V, the transistor
has a large leakage current (0.21 mA).
The transfer characteristics of the IZO EDLT gated by nanogranular SiO2 is shown
in Fig. 2.5b, while the VDS  1.5 V. When the gate voltage scanning range changes
from −2.0 to 2.0 V, transfer characteristic of EDLT changes from typical on-off state
to saturation state. ION/IOFF  2 × 107. The SS of EDLT shows the corresponding
change of the gate voltage when the leakage current changes one order of magnitude
in sub-threshold range, and the SS of the EDLT is estimated to 114 mV/decade in this
experiment. To ﬁt the linear region of I1/2
DS −VGS linearly, we obtains the VTH −

0.24 V under the positive scan voltage (VGS: −2.0 →2.0 V). At the cyclic scanning
of the gate voltage, an anti-clockwise hysteresis window can be observed at around
0.8 V in the transfer characteristic. The width of the window is calculated from the
threshold voltage difference of the positive scanning gate voltage and the negative
scanning gate voltage in the transfer characteristic. The hysteresis is caused by the
proton migration in the electrolyte gate dielectric. Due to the double layer capacitive
coupling effect of nanogranular SiO2, the EDLT realizes the low working voltage
(<2.0 V). We can calculate the carrier mobility (μsat) in the channel from the below
current-voltage formula of the FET in the saturation region as shown as follows:

we calculate the μsat 21 cm2 V−1 s−1, namely Ci 4.6 μF/cm2, as taking the
capacitance of SiO2 electrolyte at frequency 1 Hz as reference, indicating that the
IZO EDLT gated by nanogranular SiO2 has high channel carrier mobility.

residues (–OH functional groups) replaced by methoxide (–OCH3 groups). Different
grade of the methoxide gives rise to different grade of polarization, ranging from 50
to 1000 and the MZ (average of molecular weight) ranges from 10,000 to 220,000 Da.
The degree of substitution is deﬁned as the average number of CH3O, and CH3O link
to each glucose anhydride unit [7]. MC is insoluble in absolute ethanol, ethoxyethane
and acetone. It quickly disperses, swelling in the hot water (80–90 °C) and is soluble
in the water after cooling down. The liquid MC is very stable in room temperature
and form gel at high temperature. The MC gel and its solution can transform to each
other as the temperature change. Hence, MC has good properties such as lubricant,
dispersity, adhesion, thickening, emulsibility, water retention, ﬁlm formation, and
oil impermeability.
In this work, we studied the polymer-based electrolyte in terms of MC in appli-
cation of the synaptic electronics ﬁeld. Firstly, we introduced the preparation of MC
ﬁlm. Mixing 1 g pure MC power (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd) with 99 g
hot DI water (85 °C). Keep it for 5 min and then cooling down at room temperature,
and followed by stirring it by using glass rod u until it forms a transparent solution.
Drop 1 ml MC solution onto the two substrate, ITO/PET and n+type silicon, which
are cleaning up before using. Drop casting MC solution uniformly onto two substrates
and avoid bubble inside the solution, and then put the two substrates with casting
MC solution in the dry oven for 8 h and keep the drying temperature at 50 °C. Lastly,
we put the samples (substrates with MC ﬁlm) in the magnetron-sputtering cham-
ber, deposited a layer of IZO with thickness of 150 nm, and obtained the sandwich
structure of ITO/MC/ITO, which were used for MC ﬁlm characterization.

MC Film Characterizations
WeanalyzedthecrosssectionofthefabricatedMCﬁlmonSisubstrateundertheSEM
as shown in Fig. 2.6. From the ﬁgure, the MC thickness is up to 5.8 μm. The ﬁlm has
obvious porous structure within it, which is facilitate water absorption from the air
and the mobile H+ are ionized under the electrical ﬁeld. MC is obtained by partially
replacing the hydroxyl residues (–OH functional groups) with methoxide (–OCH3
groups). In Fig. 2.7a, these functional groups in MC favor the water absorption and
help to enhance the ion conductivity. The Cole-Cole plot of the methylcellulose ﬁlm
is shown in Fig. 2.7. The testing condition is 60% RH at temperature 300 k. The
tested sample is fabricated with MIM sandwich structure of IZO/MC/ITO. From the
ﬁgure, we can see the Cole-Cole curve is consist of a semi-circle and a tail, which
shows the appearance of interfacial polarization. According the ionic conductivity
formula σ 

A(R−R0), whereas L is the MC thickness of 5.8 μm, R is 960  (the
interception in real axis), Ro is resistance of the equipment which is 30 , A is area
of the electrode which is 1.5×10−3 cm2, and the ionic conductivity is calculated
as high as 4.2×10−4 S/cm. The relationship of the MC capacitance and frequency
is shown in Fig. 2.7b. The frequency is changing from 1 Hz to 1 MHz. From the
graph, we can see the MC capacitance decreases with increasing frequency. The
plateau appears in the low frequency region indicating the electric double layer. The

methylcellulose. b The speciﬁc and phase angle plotted as function of testing frequency
capacitance of MC reached up to~1.6 μF/cm2 at the 1 Hz frequency. There are three
frequency regions in phase angle plot. At high frequency region (f > 20 kHz), phase
angle is lesser than −45° which shows the capacitance. This is because the frequency
of protons in MC are unable to follow with the frequency of testing voltage and the
measuring capacitance is obtained at 1.5 nF/cm2 that is deemed as the intrinsic MC
capacitance. At the middle frequency (20 Hz < f < 20 kHz), the phase angle is larger
than −45°, the MC shows the resistance characteristic. Because in middle frequency,
some protons can accumulate at the interface and formed surface polarization. At
low frequency (1 Hz < f < 20 Hz), phase angle is lesser than −45°, MC shows the
capacitance characteristic. Because most protons in polymers are able to move and
catch up with the change of testing frequency and form the surface polarization.
It is difﬁcult to increase the charge density at the interface by further lowering the
frequency. Therefore, C-f is saturated at the low frequency region and form electric
double layer.
The leakage current (IGS −VGS) of MC ﬁlm show in Fig. 2.8. When the scanning
gate voltage changes from −1.0 to 1.0 V and scan speed is 0.05 V/s, the absolute

value of IGS keeps below 3 nA. It can be concluded that the MC ﬁlm is a high insulate
ﬁlm with proton conductivity. Hence, MC is one of ideal gate dielectric materials to
be used in EDLTs.

The Performance of EDLT Gated by MC
The structure of IZO EDLT gated by methylcellulose ﬁlm on ITO substrate is illus-
trated in Fig. 2.9a. The patterned IZO with thickness of 150 nm are used as source-
drain electrodes. The channel between source and drain is IZO ﬁlm with thickness
of 40 nm. The output curves of this transistor are showed in Fig. 2.9b. The gate
voltage is varied from 0.2 to 0.8 V with step of 0.1 V. The output performs good at
low positive voltage (<1.0 V)while it shows a good saturation under larger positive
voltage. It gives us a typical NMOS working mode. The transfer characteristics of
the transistor at saturation region (VDS 1.5 V) is showed in Fig. 2.9b. From the
plotting, the transistor on/off is as high as 2.5 × 106 with open current of 200 μA.
The subthreshold of device is calculated as 84.5 mV/dec. Fitting the curve according
the linear region of I1/2
DS −VGS, we obtain the VTH of the device about 0.1 V. From the
formula of current-voltage formula of the FET at the saturation region (formula 2.1)
and the speciﬁc capacity 1.6 μF/cm2 (f  1 Hz), the carrier mobility μsat is esti-
mated to 37 cm2 V−1 s−1. There is a hysteresis window at 0.24 V in the curve, which
indicates the existence of proton in the gate dielectric [2].
In order to study the interfacial density between MC gate dielectric and IZO
channel, we tested the transfer characteristic of this transistor in linear region as
shown in Fig. 2.9d. From the graph, we obtain the slope of subthreshold is 98 mV/dec.
The interfacial density is calculated based on the below formula:

GO Film Preparation
GO is graphitic oxide with claybank color. It normally exists as the state of powder,
ﬂake and liquid. The properties of GO become more active as O-functional group
increase after oxidation, therefore the GO property can be modiﬁed by reacting with
O-functional groups on it [10, 11].
The GO ﬁlm preparation will be introduced in the next. Firstly, pouring 1.5 g
graphite ﬂake and 1.8 g KNO3 into 69 mL of 98% H2SO4 under stirring condition.
After few minutes, pouring 12 g KMnO4 slowly. Then heating the mixture solution
to 40 °C and stirring for 6 h. After that, dropping 120 mL DI water successively and
stirring strongly, which make the temperature of solution increase up to 80 °C. Keep

stirring the suspended solution at 80 °C for 30 min, and then pouring 300 mL water
and 12 mL H2O2 (30 wt%)into the solution sequentially to dissolve the insoluble
Mn compounds. Using a large amount of water to wash the GO suspended solution
repeatedly until the PH value reaches at 5.0. Separating GO solution by ultrasonic
processing and ﬁnally we obtain a brown stable GO suspended solution. Spin coating
about 6 mg/mL GO suspended solution on ITO substrate and drying in oven at 50 °C
for 2 h. At last, we get a GO ﬁlm with thickness of 1.2 μm after measuring by the
step proﬁler.
2.4.2.2
GO Film Characterizations
GO ﬁlm with scanning area of 5 μm × 5 μm under the AFM is showed in Fig. 2.10a
[12]. From the graph, no obvious cracks, porous or other visible defects are observed
on it and the average roughness is about 8.5 nm. GO keeps the layer structure as
graphene but inducing many O-functional groups into each layer. The XRD result of
the GO ﬁlm is shown in Fig. 2.10b. There is an obvious peak at 2θ  11.5°, indicating
the distance of each layer is about 0.65 nm. Generally thinking, GO consist of O-
functional groups including epoxide groups, hydroxyl groups, and carboxyl groups
[13–15]. The peak C1s of the GO ﬁlm in XPS is shown in Fig. 2.11a. The graph
consists of 4 peaks. That is, C=C (284.8 eV), C–O, (286.2 eV), C=O (287.8 eV),
and O–C=O (289.0 eV) accordingly [16, 17]. By integrating all oxidized C peak, we
can get that the oxidized C is about 66% while the graphite C is 34%. This shows
that our fabricated GO contains many O-functional groups. GO structure and the
possible hopping mechanism of the proton in GO ﬁlm is shown in Fig. 2.11b. The
electric double layer can be formed between the interface of GO and the electrode
under the electrical ﬁeld by this hopping mechanism.
The speciﬁc capacitance as function of testing frequency is shown in Fig. 2.12a.
The test condition employs a sandwich structure of ITO/GO/Au. From the graph,
we can see the speciﬁc capacitance increases as the frequency decreases and reaches
saturation at around 1 KHz frequency. At 1 Hz frequency, it forms 18 μF/cm2 electric

leakage current of the GO ﬁlm is shown in Fig. 2.12b. The scanning voltage is varied
from −1.0 to 1 V with scan speed of 0.05 V/s, the absolute leakage current is always
lesser than 15 nA. Therefore, we conclude that GO ﬁlm has a good insulating property
and it is a good gate dielectric material.

The Performance of EDLT Gated by GO Film
The IZO EDLT gated by GO ﬁlm on glass substrate is shown in Fig. 2.13a. The
patterned IZO with thickness of 150 nm are used as the transistor source-drain elec-
trodes. The channel between source and drain is IZO ﬁlm with thickness of 40 nm.
The output characteristics of this transistor are shown in Fig. 2.13b. The gated volt-
age is progressive increasing from 0 to 1.25 V with step of 0.25 V. The output curves

steps of 0.25 V. The transfer characteristics of such transistor at c saturation region (VDS 1.5 V)
and d linear region (VDS 0.2 V)
show good linearity at low positive voltage while it shows saturation at larger positive
voltage. Hence, it shows a typical NMOS working mode.
The transfer characteristics of the transistor at saturation region with VDS  1.5 V
is shown in Fig. 2.13c. From the graph, we obtained the transistor on/off ratio as high
as 1.9 × 106, and open current up to 820 μA. The subthreshold slope of the device
is established at 84 mV/dec. By ﬁtting the curves according the linear region of I1/2
DS
−VGS, we could obtain the VTH of the device about 0.48 V. From the formula of
IV curves of the FET in the saturation region (Eq. 2.1) and the earlier tested speciﬁc
capacity 1.8 μF/cm2 (f  1 Hz), the carrier mobility μsat is estimated to 34 cm2
V−1 s−1. There is a hysteresis window of 0.2 V in the curve, which indicates the
existence of proton in the gate dielectric. Similarly, we tested transfer characterization
of GO-gated dielectric transistor in the linear region as shown in Fig. 2.13d, and the
subthreshold slope is estimated at 118 mV/dec. Based on the formula 2.2, we can
get the interfacial density Nit 1.1 × 1014 cm−2 between GO and IZO channel. The
value of interfacial density in GO-gated dielectric transistor is much higher than that
of nanogranular SiO2 gated dielectric and in MC-gated dielectric IZO transistor. It
shows that GO is an excellent gate dielectric material.
We also fabricated the transistor on the single-layer graphene PET substrate and
the preparation process is shown in Fig. 2.14a, b. Firstly, graphene is deposited on

the Cu foil by chemical vapor deposition and then graphene/Cu foil was attached to
a heat released tape through roll-to-roll machine. After that, graphene/Cu foil was
dipped in ammonium peroxydisulfate solution to etch the Cu foil. Finally, graphene
thin ﬁlm was transferred into PET substrate by roll-to-roll heat releasing process at
120 °C. The sheet resistance mapping of graphene/PET substrate in area of 6.0 cm ×
6.0 cm is shown in Fig. 2.14c. The average sheet resistance is about 217 □−1 with
standard deviation of 7.2  □−1. This is indicating that the overall sheet resistance
of graphene/PET substrate is homogeneous.
The schematic diagram of the IZO EDLT gated by GO ﬁlm on ﬂexible graphene
PET substrate is shown in Fig. 2.15a. The output characteristics of this transistor
is shown in Fig. 2.15b and it has an excellent linearity at low drain-source voltage
and shows a saturation at high drain-source voltage. It also demonstrated that this
transistor is a typical NMOS transistor. The transfer characteristics of the transistor
are shown in Fig. 2.15c. The VGS 1.5 V. From the graph, we obtained that the
transistor on/off switch can be as high as 2.4 × 106, and the open current is up to

340 μA. The subthreshold slope of the transistor is estimated as 103 mV/dec. Fitting
the linear region for the I1/2
DS −VGS, we obtained the transistor subthreshold Vth 0.
This transistor has good ﬂexibility as shown as in Fig. 2.15d. After bending it for 10,
200, 500 and 1000 times, the transfer characteristics did not show any degeneration.
Flexible IZO EDLT gated by GO ﬁlm has also been demonstrated with logistic
functions. Transfer curves of the ﬂexible neuromorphic transistor with two VGS2
biases at −1.0 and 1.0 V is shown in Fig. 2.16a. When VGS1 varied from −1.5
to 1.5 V, the transistor cannot be opened if VGS2 is ﬁxed at −1 V and open current is
lesser than 5 nA. If VGS2 is ﬁxed at 1.0 V, we can observe the phenomenon of IZO
channel transiting from insulator to metal. As shown in Fig. 2.16b, the protons are
constrained at the interface between IZO region near gate 2 and GO at VGS2  −
1.0 V. When VGS1 changes, only few protons can be involved in the formation of
electric double layers. Because of weak capacitance coupling effect, the transistor
cannot be activated. While VGS2  1.0 V, protons are driven away from interface
between IZO nearby gate 2 and GO. In this case, When VGS1 changes, there are
enough protons that can be involved into electric double layer and form a strong
capacitance coupling. This phenomenon is analogous to AND logic. We deﬁned the
gate voltages as the input signal, whereas −1.0 V represent 0, and 1.0 V represent
1. Source-drain voltage is deﬁned as output signal, whereas<10 nA is deemed as

0, and >100 μA is deemed as 1. As shown in Fig. 2.16c, by applying two impulse
sequences, the impulse period at gate 1 is twice as compared to that of in gate 2.
Therefore, we can obtain the binary inputs “00”, “01”, “10” and “11” accordingly.
In this setting, we get the results as shown in Fig. 2.16c, the output is 1 only when
the input is “11”. This shows the device can realize the logistic function of AND.
The transistor is connecting with a 2 M in series and is formed as resistor loaded
inverter. As shown in Fig. 2.16d, VDD is changing from 0.5 to 2.0 V, the inverter
performs very good. Especially, when VDD 2.0 V, the maximum gain reaches as
high as 10.

Summary
In this chapter, we focused on discussing fabrication process and characteristics of
three oxides that were used as gate dielectric in EDLT. Firstly, we employed PECVD

to fabricate the nanogranular phosphor-doped SiO2 with protonic conduction. The
dielectric for phosphor-doped SiO2 was tested as high as 3.2×10−4 S/cm and spe-
ciﬁc capacitance of double layer was 4.6 μF/cm2. EDLT gated by nanogranular SiO2
has been demonstrated to have good performance with ION/IOFF  2 × 107 and car-
rier mobility of 21 cm2 V−1 s−1. The second dielectric material is Methylcellulose
(MC), which is long-chain substituted cellulose and has good biocompatibility. The
MC gated EDLT has high proton conductance of 4.2×10−4 S/cm and double elec-
tric capacitance of 1.6 μF/cm2. Besides, the MC has good insulating property and
the open current is below 3.0 nA. Therefore, MC is an ideal electrostatic-modulated
platform for electric double layer. At last, we introduced the fabrication and charac-
teristics of GO dielectric ﬁlm. The GO dielectric ﬁlm possessed of huge electrical
double-layer capacitance of 18 μF/cm2 and it can be well deposited on ﬂexible
GO/PET substrate, which could be prepared for the ﬂexible devices.
Comparing these three materials, all of them were favorable for being used as
dielectric materials and serving as a good double-layer modulation platform. They
allcanbefabricatedatroomtemperature.Amongstthem,thefabricationofnanogran-
ular SiO2 gated EDLTs were compatible with CMOS, it can be potentially used as
neuromorphic circuit and in chips in the future. MC shows good biocompatible and
environment-friendly, which is suitable for being used in brain-machine interface,
implantable neuromorphic circuits. The GO had a simple fabrication process and
excellent performance; thus it was good for scale-up ﬂexible device production and
in the 3D devices. Lastly, all these three materials were good electrostatic-modulated
platform for ionic electrical double layer and they were perfect to be applied in EDLTs
for synaptic emulation and neuromorphic computing.

Introduction
Our brains are highly parallel, energy-efﬁcient, event-driven information processing
system, with a completely different conﬁguration from the traditional von Neumann
structure. It consists of 1011 neurons (the Neuron) and 1015 synapses, composing
a sophisticated and interconnected neural networks [1]. Synaptic transmission is a
complex process that begins with the triggering of action potentials. The potential
triggers the postsynaptic current presents 1~104 ms excitatory post-synaptic current
(EPSC) or inhibitory postsynaptic current (IPSC). This enables the postsynaptic
neuron with temporal and spatial correlation functions achieved by 103104 synapses
processing EPSC and IPSC. The delivery efﬁciency of EPSC/IPSC depends on the
synergistic effect of synaptic neuron activity and has plasticity consequently. These
have become the fundamentals for the learning and memory function of synapses. In
addition, the power consumption of a single synapse is very low, only 10−15 J/spike.
At the same time, the brain is an event-driven work model allowing the brain of a
huge network of neurons with tens of billions of neurons to work with extremely low
power consumption.
Since synapses are the most basic unit of learning and memory, simulation of
synaptic behavior is considered to be a key step in achieving neuromorphic compu-
tations. In recent years, researchers have adopted a number of novel ionic/electronic
devices, such as the memristor, atom switch, phase-change memory, ionic/electronic
hybrid transistors, etc., to simulate the synaptic behaviors and functions. This lays
a solid foundation for the neuromorphic calculation and the construction of neu-
romorphic systems. The electric-double-layer transistor (EDLTs) actually belongs
to the ion/electron hybrid transistor, which regulates the electrical properties of the
channel through electrostatic coupling and electrochemical action between electrons
and ions. This model proved to be suitable for simulation of synaptic behavior.

behaviors have been successfully simulated. These behaviors include excitatory
post-synaptic currents, double-pulse facilitation, spike-dependent plasticity, long-
term and short-term memory, and classic conditioned reﬂex behavior. The simula-
tion of these behaviors mainly depends on the electrostatic coupling of the EDL of
the interface and the electrochemical reaction mechanism. Meanwhile, this paper
also analyzes the working principle and potential application of the synaptic bionic
application of the oxide based EDL synaptic transistor.

Emulations of Short-Term Synaptic Behaviors
3.3.1
Emulations and Modulations of Excitatory
Postsynaptic Current
Figure 3.1 shows the internal structure of synapses. Synaptic transmission is a com-
plex process that begins with the triggering of an action potential that turns on a
voltage-controlled calcium channel. The diffusion of Ca2+ in neurons causes synap-
tic vesicles to release neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft. The neurotransmitter
diffuses in the synaptic cleft and eventually binds to Na+-gated ion channel receptors
on the postsynaptic nerves, causing these ion channels to open and Na+ to ﬂow into
the cell. The process of Na+ inﬂux will cause the post-synaptic neuron membrane
potential to become more positive. When this membrane potential exceeds a cer-
tain threshold, the neuron will generate an action potential. We call the excitatory
potential (current) due to the incoming of cations excitatory postsynaptic potentials
(current) (Excitatory Post-Synaptic Potential/Current, EPSP/EPSC), and the post-
synaptic neuron inhibitory potential (current) due to the entry of negative ions, is
called inhibitory postsynaptic potential (current) (Inhibitory Post-Synaptic Poten-
tial/Current, IPSP/IPSC). The two potentials (currents) last from 1 to 104 ms. This
process of generating spikes by neurons and passing them through synapses is the
most basic process of information ﬂow and processing behind the complex compu-
tations of the brain.
Figure 3.2a shows a schematic diagram of an oxide double-layer transistor sim-
ulates EPSC process. In this simulation, we deﬁne the gate electrode as the synapse
front end and add a constant voltage (VR) between the source and the drain to read the
change in channel conductance. We deﬁne the gate current induced by the gate pulse.

Fig. 3.2 a The EPSC result measured from EDL neuromorphic transistor gated by methylcellulose
ﬁlm. Inset: the EPSC process in a synapse. b The mechanisms of the EPSC emulation by the EDL
neuromorphic transistors
of a biological synapse. This process is brieﬂy described as follows: The presynap-
tic spike triggers an ion ﬂux in the postsynaptic membrane that leads to EPSC. In
Fig. 3.2a, the applied presynaptic pulse amplitude is 0.1 V pulse with width of 40 ms,
and the applied source and drain voltage is 0.1 V. The data is obtained on the IZO tran-
sistor with methyl cellulose as the gate dielectric. As shown, during the presynaptic
pulse, EPSC increased from 88 nA to about ~196 nA quickly, at the end of the pulse,
the current slowly decays back to 88 nA within about 100 ms. Figure 3.2b shows the
mechanism of the EPSC process where the electrolyte is silica nanoparticles, methyl
cellulose or graphene oxide, the conductive layer is ITO ﬁlm or monolayer graphene.
When a positive voltage pulse is applied to the gate, protons in the electrolyte will be
excited out and accumulate near the channel. These aggregated ion channel carrier
will increase the current induced by electrostatic coupling. When the pulse ends,
the protons near the interface between the channel and the electrolyte will diffuse
away from the interface due to the concentration gradient and eventually reach an
equilibrium state. This process will also cause the channel current to continuously
decrease until it stabilizes. This movement induced by the ion channel current can
be formally analogous to the organism EPSC phenomenon.
TheEPSCprocesscanbedividedintotwoindependentprocesses.Theﬁrstprocess
is the process of the presynaptic pulse response current increasing continuously. The
second process is the process of the proton decaying back to the equilibrium position
after the presynaptic pulse ends. In the ﬁrst process, the accumulation of protons
near the interface to form an EDL is equivalent to a charging process. The circuit
model can be simpliﬁed to an RC parallel circuit as shown in Fig. 3.2b. This charging
process satisﬁes the following equation:

where N(t) t>T is the concentration of ions that changes with time after the voltage
pulse ends, T is the pulse width, τ is the time constant of the diffusion process, and
β is the extension index depending on the material.
From these two processes, the EPSC process can be described by the following

. The total channel
current here is IDS I0 +ΔIDS. Where I0 is the channel current when the gate voltage
is zero.
According to Eq. 3.3, the EPSC amplitude is determined by the pulse amplitude
and width. As shown in Fig. 3.3a, the amplitude of the gate pulse we apply is 0.5 V.
The pulse width varies from 10 to 200 ms, and the EPSC amplitude varies from ~120
to ~770 nA. As shown in Fig. 3.3b, the width of the applied gate pulse is 10 ms,
and the amplitude is changed from 0.2 to 0.8 V. The corresponding EPSC amplitude
varies from ~40 to ~650 nA. It can be seen that the EPSC is indeed determined by
the amplitude and width of the gate pulse.
Parameters β and τDL together determine the rate of decay in the EPSC decay
process. Figure 3.4 shows the EPSC phenomenon of an IZO double layer transistor
with nanoparticle silica, sodium alginate, methylcellulose, and graphene oxide as
the gate dielectric. It can be seen that the relaxation of protons in these four kinds
of gate dielectric materials is different. Among them, the relaxation process in the
nano-silica is the slowest and returns to the equilibrium position in about 1 s. The
relaxation process in methyl cellulose is the fastest and returns to the equilibrium
position in about 30 ms.

Emulations of Paired-Pulse Facilitation
In neuroscience, paired-pulse-facilitation (PFF) is an important form of short-term
synaptic plasticity. This form is manifested in that the synapse response is enhanced

to be due to the increased release of neurotransmitters caused by increased calcium
concentration. It was involved in many neural processing tasks such as hearing,
information processing, and sound source localization [3, 4].

Figure 3.5a shows the schematic diagram of the double-pulse facilitation behav-
ior. In our biomimetic experiment, these two consecutive pulses are applied to the
gate. Figure 3.5b shows the PPF response measured on a typical double-layer IZO
transistor with methyl cellulose as the gate dielectric. The applied pulse amplitude
is 0.2 V pulse width 10 ms, and the time interval between two pulses is 40 ms. The
blue line in the ﬁgure is a curve ﬁtted according to formula 3.3. It can be seen that
the experimental data is in good agreement with the theory. The parameters here are
κ, τDL, τ and β respectively 766 nA, 257 ms, 9 ms and 0.74.
In the ﬁeld of neuroscience, the ratio of the amplitude of these two excited EPSC
spikes is generally deﬁned as the facilitation ratio, i.e. FA1/A2. The rate of facili-
tation in Fig. 3.5b is 1.05. Figure 3.6 shows the relationship between the facilitation
rate and the double pulse interval. The black dot is the test data, where the time inter-
val varies from 20 to 200 ms. It can be seen that the facilitation rate increases with
decreasing time interval, and approaches 1 continuously as time interval increases.

Emulations of Spatiotemporal Correlated Dynamic
Logics
In biological neural networks, presynaptic pulses from different neurons can stim-
ulate a post-synaptic current and achieve dynamic logic on post-synaptic neurons.
The simulation of dynamic logic induced by spatiotemporal synaptic stimulation was
ﬁrst reported by Yong Chen’s team. Their biomimetic work is based on a synaptic
network composed of carbon nanotube synapse transistors. As shown in Fig. 3.7a,
two consecutive pulses are applied to the two synaptic fronts (gates) respectively,
and the time at which the stimulus applied to the second synapse ends is deﬁned
as time zero. This is a methylcellulose gated IZO EDLTs. As shown in Fig. 3.7b,
the amplitude of the EPSC measured at time zero is very dependent on the time
relationship between these two consecutive pulses, with the amplitude of EPSC at
the time interval zero being the maximum.
Figure 3.8 illustrates the dynamic logic relationship between the EPSC amplitude
and the pulse interval tested for the time zero point. Black circles are experimental
data. When T ≤0, the EPSC gradually decreases to 215 nA as the absolute value
of T increases, and reaches a maximum value of ~520 nA at T0. When T>0,
the EPSC remains at 210 nA. If the pulse applied to the ﬁrst synapse is excited before
the time zero, similar to the case of PPF, the residual protons excited by the pulse will
increase the amplitude of the EPSC at time zero. The shorter the time interval, the
more obvious the promotion effect is, and the maximum value is obtained when the

time interval is zero. When the ﬁrst synaptic pulse is excited at time zero, the pulse
will have no effect on the EPSC at time zero. According to the previous theoretical
model, the dynamic logic process can be described by the following equation:
Where λ′ represents the contribution of the ﬁrst pulse-excited residual proton to
the EPSC amplitude at time zero. Parameter λ′, A1, and A 2 is estimated as: 0.92,
332 nA and 217 nA.

the enhancement in neural connection strength stemmed from repetitive, continuous
stimulation to postsynaptic neuron from presynaptic neuron. This theory is proposed
by Donald Hebb in 1949 [7]. Spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) is one of the
demonstrations of Hebbian learning rule. Study regarding to STDP is ﬁrst proposed
by Y. Dan and M. M. Poo in 1992 [8]. STDP is phenomenon that adjusts synaptic
weight via the time sequence of time sequence before and after the synapse pulse.
STDP is considered one of the basic principles of brain learning and memory.
Neural scientists observe STDP phenomenon in cortex slices, hippocampal slice,
cultured neurons and tadpoles’ heads [9–11]. As shown in Fig. 3.9, STDP is, when
pre-synaptic active potential is triggered 50 ms ahead of post-synaptic active poten-
tial, the enhancement of synaptic weight for long time duration will be observed.
And the shorter the time interval between the trigger of pre- and post- synaptic active
potential, the more obvious this phenomenon would be. If presynaptic active poten-
tial is triggered after the post-synaptic active potential, synaptic weight will result
in a long-term decrease. Similarly, when the time interval between the trigger of
pre- and post- synaptic active potential is shorter, the more obvious this decreasing
phenomenon will be, this process can be ﬁtted by equations below [12]:

STDP is widely applied to the modelling of pattern recognition, sequence learn-
ing, consistency test and so on [13–15]. Based on the importance of STDP to neu-
romorphic computing, learning and so on, STDP has become one of the most fre-
quently used models for biomimetic emulation of synaptic devices. As shown in
Fig. 3.10, they are respectively the simulation results of Ag/Si based memristor, GST
phase-changememory,ion-electrondopedsilicontransistorandnanoparticle/organic
hybrid transistor [16–19]. The ﬁrst two are 2-terminal device and the latter two are

3-terminal device. In most biomimetic experiments, for 2-terminal device, generally
the conductivity act as synapse weight, pre-/post- synaptic pulse are applied to upper
and lower electrode respectively. While for 3-terminal synaptic devices, the channel
conductivity or channel current is used as synapse weight, pre-/post- synaptic pulse
are applied to gate electrode and drain electrode (source electrode generally connect
to the ground).
These synaptic devices mainly control the movement of ions or atoms in devices
to generate non-volatile memory for the control of synaptic weight, and this process
is similar to what synapses do when they adjust ionic current to realize change
of synaptic weight. As shown in Fig. 3.11a, Ag/Si based memristor control the
conductivity of device through control the Ag atom distribution between upper/lower
electrode, realize non-volatile memory of the conductivity value [17]. As shown in
Fig. 3.11b, ion/electron hybrid Si transistor realize non-volatile control of channel
conductivity via adjusting ion/electron distribution in gate dielectric layer [16].

To realize results similar to STDP, researchers come up with multi-pulses strategy.
To conclude: (1) pre-/post- synaptic pulses; (2) speciﬁc pre-/post- synaptic pulse
sequences. The former takes advantage of accumulation of the speciﬁc polar ions
generated by pre-/post- pulses to realize STDP phenomenon. The latter design pulse
sequences to realize programmable control of the conductivity of synaptic devices
according to the properties needed to realize in STDP. To make a comparison, the
former one is closer to the biological process but can only realize an asymmetric
STDP process while latter can realize various types of STDP through ﬂexible design
of pulse sequences.
3.4.1.2
Electrochemical Doping Process of Oxide-Based EDLTs
For our devices, we found that upon the application of high gate bias, electrochemical
process will be induced. As shown in Fig. 3.12, we apply 1.0 and 4.0 V respectively
in the upper and lower electrode in the sandwich structure of ITO/SiO2/IZO for 15 s.
Among them, SiO2 is of nano granular structure. IZO, with a thickness of 40 nm,
exhibits semiconductor property and have a conductivity of 10 μS. Experiments
show that continuous voltage of 4.0 V will change the color of IZO electrode from
white to yellow brown, electrochemical tests show that the conductivity change to
50 μS in the process. This might come from the electrochemical doping process due
to the introduction of H+ into the channel. As shown in Fig. 3.12, in a relative low
voltage (1.0 V), H+ migrate in SiO2 nanoparticles and accumulate in the interface
of SiO2/IZO to form an EDL. In a relatively high voltage, part of H+ will cross
the interface into IZO electrode to induce electrochemical doping process, which
increase the conductivity of IZO.
To prove this assumption, we perform XPS to samples after the 1.0 and 4.0 V
voltage application, the XPS result for IZO is shown in Fig. 3.13. Figure 3.13a is IZO

samples after applied for a 1.0 V voltage, Fig. 3.13 bis IZO samples after applied for a
4.0 V voltage. O peak is located in: 529.5 eV for O-In bond, 530.4 eV for O-Zn bond,
531.4 eV for O vacancies and 533.0 eV for O–H bond [21–23]. After comparison of
(a) and (b) in the amount of oxygen vacancies and oxygen-metal bonding, we ﬁnd
that O-D/O-In+O-Zn improve from 1.5 to 2.2. This indicates the enhancement of
oxygen vacancies in IZO after a 4.0 V continuous voltage. And as the increase of
oxygen vacancies can also increase conductivity of IZO, this explains the increase of
conductivity after treatment. When we compare the total oxygen to the oxygen that
bond to metal, the ratio between them (O-In+O-Zn/Total O) decreases from 0.38 to
0.26. The oxygen that binds to hydrogen also increases. A reasonable explanation is
under high voltage, that H+ in SiO2 nanoparticles penetrate the interface into IZO to
induce electrochemical reactions, replace metal to bond with O, oxygen vacancies
are generated.

STDP Emulation by Oxide-Based EDLTs
Figure 3.14 is the STDP emulation result of IZO EDLT gated by SiO2 nanoparticles
based on bottom-gate structure. As shown in Fig. 3.14a, in the simulation experi-
ments, channel conductivity act as synaptic weight, pre-synaptic pulse is applied in
gate electrode while post-synaptic pulse is applied in drain electrode and the source
electrode is connected to the ground. Here we utilize both pre-/post- synaptic pulses,
which are both square wave signal, the pre-synaptic pulse amplitude is 4.0 V and
width is 10 ms, the post-synaptic pulse amplitude is 5.0 V while the width is 10 ms.
We repetitively stimulate the devices with pre-/post- synaptic pulses for 10 times to
promote either enhancement or inhibitory effect.

In Fig. 3.14b, red circles represent the STDP emulation results, which is very
similar to STDP phenomenon in real neural network. According to Eq. 3.7, we
ﬁt the STDP data and get the parameters A+, A−, τ+, τ−, that is 63, 56%, 145,
106 ms respectively. These parameters also bear resemblance to biological nerves
[25]. In IZO EDLT gated by SiO2 nanoparticles, the simulation results come from
electrochemical doping and undoping process due to large voltage. When a large
positive voltage is applied in gate electrode, protons will not only migrate in the
IZO/SiO2 interface, part of the protons can even permeate through the interface into
IZO to induce electrochemical reaction, this lead to the increase of conductivity. If
next, a large positive pulse is applied to the drain electrode, proton will decelerate
or even return to SiO2 nanoparticle electrolyte. From which, we can see that the
longer the interval, the slower the protons migration speed and more protons can
be dragged back to SiO2. This process corresponds to the conditions when tpost-pre
< 0. On the contrary, if a large positive pulse is ﬁrst applied in drain electrode,

3.4 Emulations of Long-Term Synaptic Behaviors
69
protons will enter ITO in the bottom gate, if then a large positive pulse is applied
in gate electrode, protons will decelerate and return SiO2 nanoparticles. Similarly,
the shorter the interval, the more protons stay in ITO electrode. This is equal to the
generation of proton vacancies in SiO2, which lead to the decrease in conductivity
of IZO channel. This corresponds to tpost-pre > 0 conditions.
3.4.2
Emulations of Memory Behaviors
In 1968, Richard C. Atkinson and Richard Shiffrin raise the multistore model in
human memory [26]. Figure 3.15 is the schematic diagram of multistore model. In
this model, new information come from outside environment are stored temporarily
in sensory storage unit, this kind of memory is called sensory memory (SM). The
information will selectively transition to short term memory (STM) that is stored
in short term memory base or permanently long term memory (LTM) that is stored
in long term memory base. More importantly, Atkinson and Shiffrin proposed that
short term memory can be trained into long term memory, and the possibility of the
transition will increase with training times.
As discussed in this Sect. 3.3, in a relatively low gate voltage, movement of ions
in electrolyte is inﬂuenced by electrostatic coupling effect, this process is temporary.
And in a relatively higher gate voltage, ions in electrolyte might have electrochemical
reaction with semiconductor in the channel, in this way the emulation of short term
and long term memory can be realized. Though short term memory belongs to short
interval behavior of synapses, to have a comprehensive discussion of emulation of
memory behavior in oxide double layer transistor, we will discuss this content here.
As shown in Fig. 3.16a, we apply 10 continuous pulses with amplitude of 1.0 V
and width of 100 ms to IZO EDLT gated by nanogranular SiO2. When the pulses
are over, we found that, the conductivity of channel increase rapidly from ~3.0 to
9.0 μS. After that, the conductivity decreases gradually to original state with time.
The process lasts for 14 s, this behavior is similar to the short term memory behavior.
As shown in Fig. 3.16b, we apply 10 continuous pulses with amplitude of 4.0 V and
width of 100 ms to IZO EDLT gated by nanogranular SiO2, when the pulses are
over, the conductivity of channel increase rapidly from ~3.0 to 123.0 μS. Later, the

conductivity almost remains constant. This behavior is found to be kept for a long
term, similar to long term memory behavior.
Figure 3.17 shows the emulation result of short/long term memory behavior based
on multi-memory model. When a lower gate voltage (1.0 V) is applied, memory
volume (channel conductivity) reach the highest when the stimulation is just over
and then decrease to the original state. The value and lasting time for memory increase
with the increase of pulses number, this is similar to the revision process of memory.
The more one revise certain content, the deeply one can remember. When a higher
gate voltage (4.0) is applied, memory volume reaches the highest and last for a long
time, which is the formation of long-term memory.
Based on the electrostatic coupling and electrochemical properties of IZO EDLT
gated by nanogranular SiO2, we successfully model the short/long term memory
process. This is not only helpful for the application of electronics in psychology,

3.4 Emulations of Long-Term Synaptic Behaviors

memory and learning, also provide new perspectives for electronics emulation of
neuromorphic computing and storage.
3.4.3
Emulations of Classical Conditioning
Classical conditioning (Pavlovian classical conditioning), refers to multiple times
of one stimulus paired with another unconditioned reward or punishment stimulus,
can enable individuals to demonstrate the stimulus and at the same time elicit a
conditioning response that is usually similar to unconditioned response [28, 29].
Classical conditioning examples include repetitive neutral stimulus and uncondi-
tioned stimulus. The unconditioned stimulus (US) can elicit unconditioned response
(UR) without learning, the relationship between unconditioned stimulus and uncon-
ditioned response is called unconditioned reﬂection. Conditioned stimulus (CS) is
neural stimulus (NS) that can elicit conditioned response (CR), which requires learn-
ing. And conditioned stimulus is related to psychological immediacy and long-term
expectation, satisfactory and fear. The relationship between conditioned stimulus and
conditioned response is called conditioned reﬂection. When unconditioned stimu-
lus repetitively or ﬁercely accompanies with a neutral stimulus, this stimulus will
become a conditioned stimulus and conditioned reﬂection will be generated.
The most famous example in classical conditioning is the Pavlov’s dog saliva
conditioning reﬂection. Before the establishment of conditioning reﬂection, dogs
will only secret saliva to food and bell ringing cannot induce this kind of behavior.
When feed and bell ringing went on at the same time, the dog built connection
between bell ringing and food. After repetitive stimulation, the dog would secret
saliva with only the presence of bell ringing.
As shown in Fig. 3.18, we use IZO EDLT gated by nanogranular SiO2 for condi-
tioning reﬂection emulation, this device is non-crystalline transistor. The feature of
this transistor is that no junction exists between source/drain electrode and channel.
Compared with traditional transistor with junction, the source/drain electrode and
channel share a heavily doped Si NW in junctionless transistor, and thus largely
simplify the traditional device fabrication technique and lower the device cost. Here,
We use IZO thin ﬁlm as source/drain electrode and channel. It is fabricated through
the control of O2. The details are that in the magnetron sputtering of IZO process,
ﬁrstly a 4% O2 atmosphere is applied, after 30 nm IZO is deposited, O2 is turned off
and another 30 nm IZO is continuously deposited. In the second deposition process,
O2 level kept dropping. This technique comes from following two reasons [30]: (1)
IZO deposition under O2 have lower charge carrier concentration and better semi-
conductor property, the conductivity is better controlled in a large range; (2) In low
O2 or no O2 atmosphere, IZO have higher charge carrier concentration and better
conductivity, thus form good ohm contact with tungsten probe.
As shown in Fig. 3.18a, we connect A/B terminal to the ground, apply a continuous
20 s voltage to C terminal and ITO bottom gate, results show that AB part change
color while BC part stay unchanged. According to the above, AB part possibly

generate electrochemical reactions because of large voltage difference, while C have
no voltage difference with bottom gate, thus no obvious electrochemical reaction
happens. We separately test transfer curves of AB part and BV part, the results
are shown in red and black lines. AB part is unchanged when gate voltage change
from −2.5 to 1.5 V, and a high conductivity is maintained. BC part have obvious
change from metal to insulator, even the highest conductivity is lower than AB part.
This result proves the assumption before, that is the electrochemical reaction in AB
part result in long term conductivity enhancement, a metal property; while BC part
maintains semiconductivity without electrochemical property.
Based on the complex devices obtained after electrochemical processing from
Fig. 3.18a, we design circuits in Fig. 3.18b: connect A terminal in bottom gate
through a inverter. To emulate conditioning reﬂection process, we deﬁne A terminal
as food input 1 and B terminal as saliva secret terminal, C terminal as bell ringing
input terminal. As shown in Fig. 3.18c, black pulses represent food stimulus signal,
blue pulses represent bell ringing stimulus signal and red is saliva secretion response.
Among them, every pulse signal has amplitude of −2.0 V and width of 50 ms, every
pulses sequence includes 5 single pulses. We deﬁne 40 μA as threshold for saliva

analyzation. From the ﬁgure, we know that before conditioning reﬂection training,
only food stimulus signal can induce a 100 μA response, while single bell ringing
signal can only elicit a 20 μA response. This means only food stimulus can elicit
saliva secretion. Next, we work on conditioning reﬂection training, that is to apply
food stimulus and bell ringing stimulus at the same time, 14 times of the two stimuli
were included in the training. When we apply single stimulus signal after the training,
we ﬁnd that, both bell ringing and food stimulus signal can induce high response.
The device built associate learning for the two stimuli.
Figure 3.18d shows the scheme of associate learning. At the beginning, when
no training is applied, AB part can be equivalent to metallic channel that is broken
down electrochemically, the channel become very conductive due to electrochemical
doping, that is why they have higher output current response under input 1. While BC
part is more like normal semiconductor channel, the current is small, thus lead to a
small output current under input 2. In the training process, because of the application
of the two signals, the difference between 	G and 	C reaches 4.0 V, in this way,
electrochemical doping is elicited in BC part. Therefore, after training, both AB part
and BC part are equivalent to electrochemically breakdown channel, high output
response are induced by both input 1 and 2, the connection between the two input is
established.

Summary
This chapter discusses using IZO EDLT for two synaptic plastic behavior emula-
tion experiments. The ﬁrst plastic behavior is short-term behavior, which include
emulation and control of post-synaptic excited current, double pulses facilitation
emulation, temporal and spatial dynamic logical behavior, short-term memory. The
second plastic behavior is long-term behavior, this include spike timing dependent
plastic behavior, long-term memory, classical conditioning reﬂection emulation. The
former emulation mainly depends on double layer electrostatic control of ion cou-
pling. The speed of ion migration in electrolyte can reach tens to hundreds of ms level,
this characteristic enables short-term memory for IZO EDLT, therefore, short-term
signal processing can be emulated. The latter behavior is related to electrochemical
property of IZO EDLT. Under a relatively high gate voltage, protons in gate dielec-
tric will experience electrochemical doping and de-doping phenomena in metal oxide
semiconductor IZO, electrochemical doping can increase conductivity of IZO in a
long term. In contrast, de-doping can suppress IZO conductivity in a long term.
Long-term behavior can thus be realized.
Besides, in this chapter, on the basis of double layer electrostatic control and ion
relaxation equation, we construct short-term plastic behavior theory model of IZO
EDLT. This model matches well with experimental results, providing theoretical
guidance for short-term plastic behavior.
In conclusion, the two plastic behaviors is machining, processing, computing
neural signal behavior in brain and also basis for memory, computing and learning

of synapses. The emulation of these behaviors is not only meaningful for neural
shape calculation from hardware and also provides new thoughts for new storage
device for brain stimulation.

Introduction
Neuromorphic engineering, or neuromorphic computing, is a concept brought out by
Carver Mead in the late eighties of last century [1]. Inspired by the working patterns
of human brain, neuromorphic engineering aims at building a no-bio system which
has similar functions to the brain, or more speciﬁcally an ultra-low power electronic
computer with powerful functions including autonomous learning and cognition
[1]. To realize neuromorphic engineering, scientists have proposed two methods:
software-based method and hardware-based method. For software-based method, a
research team in IBM once used a supercomputer named Blue Gene to simulate a
neural network with the same complexity as the cat’s brain, at a rate equivalent to 1%
of the real neuron response rate [2]. However, this experiment cost a huge amount of
computing resources, including 147,456 microprocessors, 144 TB of storage space
and1.4MWofpower.Sincethesoftware-basedapproachstillworksonthetraditional
sequence machines with limited parallelism, it is a great challenge for software-based
methods to realize the neural morphology calculation with less resources. In contrast,
the hardware-based approach can realize large-scale parallelism and high plasticity
as a real neural network on the physical level. Therefore, hardware-based approach
has the potential to solve this challenge.
Up till now, many research groups have demonstrated a series of neuromorphic
computing functions using synaptic devices or even synaptic device arrays [3–6]. For
example, Professor Strukov from the University of California, Santa Barbara, has
implemented a one-layer hardware perceptual neural network using an memristor
array based on Al2O3/TiO2, which successfully classiﬁed the alphabet shapes of a
3 × 3 pixel from noises [3]. In these reports, two-terminal synaptic devices often
act as a memory unit with tunable connection weight. Thus, it’s very similar to a
synapse in neural networks. However, due to the gate modulating function, three-
terminal synaptic transistors can not only achieve plastic connection weights, but

also act as neural ﬁlters, integrators, etc. Therefore, three-terminal synaptic devices
may have more potential in neuromorphic engineering.
On basis of the previous research on synaptic bionic applications of various kinds
of oxide-based electric-double-layer transistors (EDLTs), this chapter focus on the
implementation of a series of neuromorphic algorithms, including non-linear den-
dritic integrating, direction adjusting, neural computing, and barriers avoiding. These
functions are implemented for the ﬁrst time on three-terminal synaptic devices. More-
over, direction tuning and neural computing functions are realized for the ﬁrst time
on solid-state electronic devices. The realization of these functions will be of great
signiﬁcance to the development of hardware-based neuromorphic engineering.

Nonlinear Dendritic Integration
4.3.1
Dendrite and Dendritic Integration
In nerve cells, the branches produced by the extension of the cell body are called
dendrites. Dendrites are the entrances which receive information transmitted from
other neurons [7]. As shown in Fig. 4.1a, the dendrite receives chemical substances
(transmitter) released by the axon of the pre-synaptic neuron to generate a potential
difference between the nerves and form a current transmitting message. Each neuron
can have one or more dendrites that can receive stimulation and transmit the exci-
tation into the cell body. Since neurotransmitters only exist in the synaptic vesicles
within the pre-synaptic membrane, they can only be released from the pre-synaptic
membrane and then act on the postsynaptic membrane. Thus, the transfer of excita-
tion between neurons is unidirectional. It has to be mentioned that dendrites are not
the only passages for nerve afferents, but can also be cell membranes.
As shown in Fig. 4.1b, dendrites can collect, integrate, and modulate thousands
of pre-synaptic input signals, and then transmit these signals through axons to post-
synaptic neurons [8]. In neural networks, vertebral neurons have ability to nonlinearly
integrate synaptic inputs on dendrites with complex structures and functions [9, 10].
Dendritic integration is an important information processing function in neural net-
works [9–11]. It includes the integration of unsynchronized single events occurring
in the same region (also called temporal summation) and the integration of simul-
taneous events occurring in different regions (also called spatial summation) [11].
Initially, scientists believe that this integration is linear, and they believe that the addi-
tive effect of two or more excited synaptic inputs depends only on their independent
response, without regard to the absolute or relative position of these synaptic inputs
at the dendrite [11]. In fact, as recent studies have revealed, dendritic integration
is actually non-linear. As shown in Fig. 4.2, when the response caused by two or
more inputs together is lower than the sum of the individual responses, it is deﬁned
as sub-linear. And when the response caused by the two or more inputs together is
higher than that of each, it is deﬁned as super-linear.

Since dendritic integration is one of the mechanisms of computational and
memory-related functions of neural tissue, the implementation of dendritic integra-
tion at the hardware level will have important implications for further computational
and memory-related functions in neuromorphic engineering. In our EDLTs, since a
huge double-layer capacitance is formed only at the interface between the gate dielec-
tric and the channel, the gate voltage is almost entirely applied to this interface, and
there is almost no potential drop inside the electrolyte. Thus, the electrostatic cou-
pling effect of the electric double layer is hardly affected by the distance between
gate and channel [6, 14]. Based on this principle, multiple inputs can be coupled to
one channel at the same time. This mechanism provides the possibility of multi-input
dendritic integration.
4.3.2
Emulation of Nonlinear Dendritic Integration
Firstly, we simulated the nonlinear dendritic integration function. As shown in
Fig. 4.3a, an IZO EDLTs with methyl cellulose as the gate electrolyte was used
for simulation. Gate1 and Gate2 are set as two presynaptic inputs, respectively. A
0.5 V voltage was applied between the source and drain to read the EPSC. As shown
in Fig. 4.3b, when a 1.0 V pulse was applied on Gate 1 and Gate 2 separately, the
EPSC was measured to be of ~22.5 and ~27.2 nA, respectively. The arithmetic sum
of the two EPSCs is of ~49.7 nA. When a 1.0 V pulse is applied to these two inputs
simultaneously, the measured sum of the two EPSCs was of ~60 nA. Then the input
voltage was systematically changed from 0.2 to 0.8 V, the corresponding arithmetic
and measured sums were recorded and plotted in Fig. 4.3c. As discussed above,
the superposition is close to linear when opposed to weak input signals, while it is
super-linear when the input signal surpasses a threshold value (e.g. 0.8 V).
Figure 4.4 illustrates the dendritic integration function of the graphene oxide
electrolyte based synaptic transistor. Figure 4.4a shows the tested IZO EDLTs gated
by graphene oxide. The method used here is similar to that of the methyl cellulose
based synaptic transistor. As shown in Fig. 4.4b, the reading voltage (VDS) was set as
0.2 V and the input voltage was systematically changed from 0.2 to 1.4 V. However,
the integration behavior here is quite different from that of the methyl cellulose based

synaptic transistor. The superposition shows close-linear characteristic under weak
input signal. For example, when the input voltage is set as 0.2 V (V1  V2  0.2 V),
the arithmetic sum is 61 nA while the measured sum is 78 nA. The superposition
shows super-linear characteristic under moderate input signal. For example, when
the input voltage is set as 1 V (V1  V2  1 V), the arithmetic sum is 5.6 μA while
the measured sum is 9.0 μA. The superposition shows sub-linear characteristic under
strong input signal. For example, when the input voltage is set as 1.4 V (V1  V2 
1.4 V), the arithmetic sum is 12.6 μA while the measured sum is 10.6 μA. This “S”
shape curve resembles to the results of some biological experiments [11].

According to Fig. 2.13d in Sect. 2.5, we can give a reasonable explanation for
this phenomenon. Since the pulse duration is relatively short (10 ms) and the channel
length is 80 μm, the amplitude of the EPSC depends not only on the gate voltage
but also on the electron mobility within the channel. According to the transfer curve
in Fig. 2.13d, the electron mobility ﬁrst increases slowly, then increases quickly and
ﬁnally decreases slowly. In this way, under two small gate-voltage inputs, the mobil-
ity increases slowly. The amplitude of the EPSC is close-linear with the magnitude
of the pulsed input voltage. As the input voltage increase, the mobility increases dra-
matically. Once the EPSC amplitude increased faster than the input voltage increases,
a super-linear superposition is exhibited. With the input voltage keep increasing, the
mobility is attenuated and the increase in EPSC lags behind the increases in input
voltage, presenting a sub-linear superposition.
4.3.3
Modulation of Nonlinear Dendritic Integration
Figure 4.5 illustrates the dendritic integration function implemented on the EDL
synaptic transistor gated by nanogranular SiO2 as electrolyte. As shown in Fig. 4.5a,
P1, P2, …, Pn were deﬁned as input terminals of the presynaptic synapse, and Pm
as the regulator terminal. The unique EDL coupling effect makes it possible to inte-
grate multiple inputs into the channel, which is very similar to the dendrite in neural
systems. As shown in Fig. 4.5b, c, a 1.4 V pulse (10 ms) was ﬁrst separately and
then simultaneously applied on P1 and P2. During the pulse period, an synchronized
modulating signal was applied on Pm. The speciﬁc and integrated EPSC amplitudes
were recorded as A1, A2 and Sm. When Vm was set as −0.5 V, A1, A2 and Sm were
measured to be 37, 19 and 110 nA, exhibiting obvious super-linear superposition
characteristic. When Vm was set as 0 V, A1, A2 and Sm were measured to be 182, 132
and 287 nA, presenting close-linear superposition characteristic. This result means
that the dendritic integration characteristic of our synaptic transistor could be mod-
ulated like the brains of living systems. As shown in Fig. 4.5d, different modulating

input. The input pulse is 1.0 V in amplitude and 10 ms in width. The amplitude of the modulatory
voltages are b −0.5 V and c 0 V, respectively. d The modulation results with different input voltage.
The modulatory input voltages are −0.5, 0, and 0.5 V, respectively
voltages were applied on the Pm (i.e. −0.5, 0, 0.5 V). For each modulating voltage,
the corresponding integration characteristic was tested by systematically changing
the input voltage from 0.2 to 1.4 V. It was found that the superposition characteristic
varied from sub-linear to super-linear. Here we give a reasonable explanation for this
phenomenon. When Vm was set as 0 V, the synaptic transistor worked on the linear
region as the input voltage varied from 0.2 to 1.4 V. Thus, the EPSC amplitude tends
to increase linearly with the input voltage. When Vm was under 0 V, the synaptic
transistor worked on the linear region. The measured current increased faster than
the input voltage, presenting super-linear superposition characteristic. When Vm was
beyond 0 V, the synaptic transistor worked on close-saturate region. Thus, the EPSC
amplitude increased slowly, presenting sub-linear superposition characteristic.
Figure 4.6a illustrates an important dendritic integration function which is called
shunting inhibition. Shunting inhibition is an important mechanism for regulating
neurological responses. Excitatory input leads to inward post-synaptic currents from
the dendrite to neuronal somatic cells (soma). Nevertheless, when excitatory input
and inhibitory input are triggered simultaneously, the depolarized current will ﬂow
away before reaching to the neural somatic cells [16]. As shown in Fig. 4.6b, pulsed
modulating signals with a width of 10 ms were applied on Pm. The interval between
each pulse was 0.75 s, and its amplitude was −1.0, 0, and 1.0 V, respectively. At the

mode was plotted as 2D-surface
same time, excitatory inputs with amplitude of 1.0 V and a pulse width of 10 ms were
applied on P1. When the modulating signal was −1.0 V, there was almost no response
and it was analogous to the shunting inhibition behavior. When the modulating signal
was 0 and 1.0 V, the EPSCs were measure to be 113 and 298 nA. It is seen that positive
modulating signal can promote EPSC. As shown in Fig. 4.6c, biased modulating
signals were applied on Pm, and its amplitude was −0.5, 0, and 0.5 V, respectively.
Excitatory inputs with an amplitude of 1.0 V and a pulse width of 10 ms were applied
on P1 at the same time. When the modulating signal was −0.5 V, there was almost
no response and it was analogous to the shunting inhibition behavior. EPSCs were
measured to be 102 and 383 nA when the modulating were 0 and 0.5 V, respectively.
It is seen that positive modulating signal can promote EPSC. By contrast of these
two modes of regulation, its easy to ﬁnd that the biased modulating signal is more
effective. This means that you can achieve the same results with smaller regulation
voltage. To further study the inﬂuence of the biased regulation on excitatory inputs,
we systematically changed the regulation voltage and the excitatory input voltage.
As shown in Fig. 4.6d, the results were plotted into a 2D surface. It is seen that
the range of synaptic responses were altered continuously from approximately a few

4.3 Nonlinear Dendritic Integration
85
nanoamperes to approximately 400 nA. Therefore, the biased regulation mode makes
the synaptic device’s response adjustable at a large range.
4.3.4
Analog Logic Based on Dendritic Integration
The weights of dendritic synapses used in the above experiments were basically the
same. While in neural systems, synaptic weights vary with location and function
[17]. As shown in Fig. 4.7a, the electrode areas of G1 and G2 are almost the same.
When the same pre-synaptic pulse (0.5 V, 10 ms) was applied to the two gates, the
resulting EPSCs were basically on the same amplitude. The ﬁrst EPSC is of ~93 nA,
and the second is of ~89 nA. Then the two pre-synaptic pulses were systematically
changed, and the corresponding EPSC amplitudes were recorded. The superstition
characteristic was plotted into a 2D surface as shown in Fig. 4.7b. While in Fig. 4.7c,
the electrode area of G2′ is about 2.53 times that of G1. When receiving the same pre-
synaptic pulse (0.5 V, 10 ms), the resulting EPSCs were very different. The ﬁrst EPSC
amplitude on G1 was of ~152 nA and the second on G2′ was of ~350 nA. It is seen that
the electrode area can be used as an important parameter for designing the synaptic
weight distribution of neuromorphic circuits based on such neuromorphic transistors.
In the same way, the superposition characteristic was tested and plotted into a 2D
surface as shown in Fig. 4.7d. It was found that the superposition characteristics were
very different by comparing Fig. 4.7b, d. Here we deﬁned 750 nA as the threshold
value. In Fig. 4.7b, the amplitude of integrated EPSC can exceed the threshold plane
only when both two pre-synaptic pulses were strong enough. For example, when the
two pre-synaptic pulses were 1.2 and 0.2 V, the integrated EPSC was 510 nA. When
the two pre-synaptic pulses were 1.2 and 2.0 V, the integrated EPSC was as high
as 830 nA. In Fig. 4.7d, the amplitude of integrated EPSC can exceed the threshold
plane only when the pre-synaptic pulses applied on G2′ was strong enough. These
two situations are very similar to logic “AND” and logic “YESG2”. Here we deﬁned
imputing 1.0 and 0 V pulse as logic 1 and logic 0, separately. Thus, there could
be four different imputing signals on the two pre-synaptic terminals, noted as “00”,
“01”, “10” and “11”. Then we deﬁned the EPSC amplitude surpassing 750 nA as
logic 1, or under 750 nA as logic 0. Figure 4.7f shows the truth table of these two
kinds of logic and the ideal two-dimensional surface map.

as a simple linear superposition and binarization device. Neurons are thought to be
able to perform a weighted summation of synaptic inputs only through non-linear
binarization operations, and even primary operations such as multiplicative variation
of multiple signals require collaboration of a set of neurons [18]. However, most
recent studies have shown that a single neuron can act as a more powerful operation
unit, and even single neurons can perform additive and multiplicative operations of
synaptic input [10, 19, 20].

In the brain, information can be presented through different forms of neural activ-
ity, and it is generally divided into two modes. As shown in Fig. 4.8, the ﬁrst mode
is rate coding and second is temporally correlated coding [21]. In the transmitting
process of coded information, there are two types of presynaptic input signals. One is
calleddrivinginputsignal,makingtherelatedneuronactivitiesmoreintense.Another
is called modulatory input signal. It is mainly about adjusting the effectiveness of the
driving signal. Neurons utilize a set of nonlinear integration and control methods to
perform various mathematical transformations of synaptic inputs and neural outputs
to achieve various learning, memory, and computational functions [20].
Figure 4.9 illustrates a series of mathematical transformations of the relations
between neural input and output. Here d and m are deﬁned as the drive input and
the control input, respectively, and R(d, m) is deﬁned as the output. Figure 4.9a, c
shows the modulation of neural input. For input-side regulation, the addition form
can be written as R(d, m)  f (d + m), and the multiplicative form can be written
as R(d, m)  f (d × m). Figure 4.9b, d shows the modulation of neural output. For
output-side regulation, the addition form can be written as R(d, m)  f (d + m), and
the multiplicative form can be written as R(d, m)  f (d) × f (m).
According to the last section, our EDL synaptic transistors can non-linearly reg-
ulate the integration performance of multiple inputs. Therefore, it may also be used
to implement the above-mentioned neural arithmetic behavior.
4.4.2
Realization of Neuronal Arithmetic
An IZO EDL synaptic transistor gated by graphene oxide was used for simulating the
neural algorithm function. Figure 4.10a shows the schematic diagram. The driving
input signal is applied on G1 and G2, the modulating input signal is applied on
Gm. These signals that serve as pre-synaptic stimulations can be coupled to the
channel through two series EDL capacitor mediated by the bottom ITO electrode,
triggering a common EPSC. As shown in Fig. 4.10b, the two driving inputs (V1
and V2) are frequency-coded Poisson distribution signals, and the modulating input
signal (Vm) is zero. Each driving input signal contains ten pulses (0.5 V, 10 ms),

and the average frequency of each pulse sequence is 20 spikes/s. Thus, the average
frequency of the entire driving input signal is 40 spikes/s. It is seen that the output
EPSC amplitude reaches to its peak value at the point where the pulse pairs are most
dense, which is approximately 90.8 nA. As shown in Fig. 4.10c, the modulating
input signal was systematically changed from −0.1, 0 to 0.1 V. For each regulation
signal, the frequency of the driving input signal was changed from 6.7 spikes/s to
100 spikes/s. As indicated in the ﬁgure, the modulating signal has changed the EPSC-
Frequency curve. To simulate the neural algorithm function in the biological system,

EPSC amplitude of pulse stimulation were deﬁned as the input (d  f ), the control
input (m  V m), and the output (R), respectively. Then these curves could be ﬁtted
by the following equation:

Among them, A, B, C, and D were ﬁtted to be 129 nA, 2.46, 0.055 s/spikes,
and 3.1 V−1, respectively. Therefore, this neural input-output relationship can be
decomposed into a function of the drive signal multiplied by a function of the control
signal. According to the previous content, this regulation equals to the multiplication
of the output, as exhibited in Fig. 4.10d. Thus, the frequency coded multiplication
regulation was implemented on the IZO EDL synaptic transistor.
Similarly, the time-correlated coded multiplication regulation was also imple-
mented. In time-correlated coding, information is coded in the relative time of the
pulses. As shown in Fig. 4.11a, the time interval between the two driving signals is
50 ms and the regulation signal voltage is zero. The EPSC amplitude was measured
to be ~35 nA. The modulating input signal was changed on the same way. As shown
in Fig. 4.11b, for each regulation signal, the pulses interval is changed from 10 to
300 ms. It is seen that the time-correlated coded neural input-output relationship
curve can also be modulated by the regulation signal. Here the frequency of the drive
signal, the relative time of the driving input signal were deﬁned as the input (d 
ΔT), the control input (m  V m), and the output (R), respectively. Then these curves
could be ﬁtted by the following equation:

posed into a function of the drive signal multiplied by a function of the regulation
signal. According to the previous content, this regulation equals to the multiplica-
tion of the output. Thus, time-correlated coded multiplication regulation was also
implemented.

Visual Processing Functions
4.5.1
Introduction of Visual Processing Function
Lightworksonvisualorganstomaketheirreceptivecellsexcited,andtheinformation
is processed by the visual neural system to produce the vision [22]. It is through the
vision that humans and animals obtain important information such as perceiving the
size, lightness, color, and motion of external objects. Vision is the most important
sense that at least 80% of the external information is obtained visually.
Billions of nerve cells line up in three layers on the retina, forming a complex infor-
mation processing network through synapses. The ﬁrst layer is the photodetectors.
The second layer is the intermediate nerve cells, including bipolar cells, horizontal
cells and amacrine cells. The third layer is the ganglion cells [23]. There are two
layers of synapses interconnecting these three layers of nerve cells. One is called
outer plexiform layer which is between the photodetectors and the bipolar cells or
horizontal cells. Another is called inner plexiform layer which is between the gan-
glion cells and the bipolar cells or amacrine cells. After exciting the photodetectors,
signals are transmitted through bipolar cells to amacrine cells, and then transmitted
to the neural center through amacrine cells’ axons (optic nerve ﬁber). Wherever in

4.5 Visual Processing Functions
91
the outer and inner plexiform layer, signals are modulated by horizontal cells and
amacrine cells, respectively. This signal transmission is mainly achieved through
chemical synapses, but there are also electrical synapses (gap junctions) between
photoreceptors and horizontal cells, which interact with each other.
Many of the organism’s visual processing functions are currently beyond the
reach of traditional computers. For example, humans and many animals can easily
recognize many objects, extracting useful information from numbers of visual inputs
obtained from a complex, timely changing real world. Therefore, it is of great signif-
icance to use biological neural strategy to achieve some visual processing functions,
such as image processing, pattern recognition and speech recognition [3, 24–26]. For
example, S. Yu et al. have proposed using an HfOx-based resistive-switching device
array to achieve direction learning and recognition functions [24].
In this section, we implemented some visual processing functions on the graphene
oxide gated metal oxide EDL synapse transistor, including the directional adjustment
function and the collision avoidance function of the LGMD (lobula giant movement
detector) nerve.
4.5.2
Realization of Orientation Tuning Functions
In the visual neural network, neurons in the primary visual cortex usually respond
preferentially to the edge of a speciﬁc direction [27–29]. Since the input of visual
information is through the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) into the cortex, LGN is
very sensitive to the direction of the input visual information. However, studies have
shown that, as a direction detector, LGN only excites on a very narrow direction range
while suppress on other wider direction ranges. Therefore, the brain performs the
orientation tuning of visual information through a series of direction detectors with
a speciﬁc range of direction selectivity [27]. Thus, this orientation tuning function
is very important for visual processing functions such as direction recognition and
pattern recognition.
Figure 4.12 illustrates the simulation results of the orientation tuning function.
Figure 4.12a shows a bionic vision system based on an IZO EDL synaptic transistor
gated graphene oxide. A photodetector is connected to the transistor gate through a
processing circuit. A square plate with black and white stripes is placed parallel to
the photo detector with a distance. The transmission point of the photodetector to the
plate is deﬁned as the origin point O, and the connection line between point O and
the photodetector is perpendicular to the yoz plane. The plate center is placed on the
y-axis, and the angle between the stripes and the z-axis is deﬁned as the direction
angle (θ). The plate moves along the y-axis on the yoz plane, and the photodetector
can identify edges of the stripes by detecting light and dark changes. In each move,
point O passes through one side of the board to another. Whenever the edge of the
black-and-white stripe is detected, the processing circuit will provide a pulse (0.5 V,
10 ms) to the gate of the synapse transistor connected to it, which is equivalent to
inducing a pre-synaptic stimulus. Figure 4.12b, c shows the results of the induced

presynaptic pulse and the corresponding EPSC response in respect to the case where
the orientation angles are 0° and 78.5°, respectively. The former case produced ten
presynaptic pulses at a frequency of about 50 Hz, triggering an EPSC of ~319 nA.
The latter case only produced two presynaptic pulses with a frequency of about
10 Hz, triggering an EPSC of ~122 nA. Figure 4.12d shows the normalized EPSC
response amplitude for different orientation angles. The black solid line shows the
ﬁtting curve with Gaussian equation. It is seen that the vision system has an obvious
selectivity for the direction angle at 0°, with a half-height width of ~44.5. Thus,
this simulation of the directional regulation behavior is achieved. Moreover, if a
series of synapse transistors with selectivity to a speciﬁc direction range are set and
the weight distribution in the bio-optic nervous system is simulated, animal-like
orientation recognition functions may be achieved.
4.5.3
Realization of Collision Avoidance
In organisms like locusts, detecting impending objects like enemies of birds can
be achieved through their lobula giant movement detector (LGMD). These neu-

4.5 Visual Processing Functions
93
rons, along with the descending contralateral movement detector (DCMD), produce
a series of pulses when approaching to objects. And the frequency of the pulses
increases as the object approaches. LGMD neurons can recognize the proximity of
the object by using the movement rate of the object edge and its length growth on
the retina.
Rind and Bramwell et al. once proposed a model for the LGMD-related neural
circuits [30]. This model is based on the anatomy structure and physiology function
of the optic lobe. This model contains three basic layers:
(1) Photosensitive Input Layer: responds to changes in the image.
(2) Processing Layer: processes the optical images.
(3) Output Layer: This layer is the LGMD neurons. Here the excitatory and
inhibitory signals are processed and integrated to output the response.
In accordance with this model, we designed an artiﬁcial vision circuit as shown in
Fig. 4.13a. The photosensitive input layer is a 20 × 20 photodetection array, noted as
P11, P12, …, P20,20. The processing layer is a processing circuit. The main function of
the processing circuit is to generate a pulse (0.5 V, 10 ms) to the corresponding gate
when one detector detects the edge of the object. The output layer is a multi-gate
structure of graphene oxide which is a gate dielectric IZO double layer transistor
in which the gates are numbered G11, G12, …, G20, 20. The tested square plate is
placed parallel to the photodetector array, and the trajectory center of the square plate
is in line with the center of the photodetector array. The tested square plate moves
at a ﬁxed rate (l/|v|  50 ms) near or far to the photodetector array. By ﬁtting the
relevant parameters of the transistor output characteristic, A0, A, τ and β are ﬁtted
to be 10, 37.5 nA, 1.06 ms, 0.35, respectively, according to formula 3.3 in Sect.
3.3. Here MATLAB is used to simulate the output characteristics of the multi-gate
structure transistor based on the above parameters. The speciﬁc mathematical model
is described in detail below. As shown in Fig. 4.13b, the response of the artiﬁcial
vision system rises suddenly as the object approaches, and it reaches to its maximum
value of ~2.2 μA at the time of ~28 ms before the collision. As shown in Fig. 4.13c,
when the object moves away, the artiﬁcial vision system response ﬁercely only at the
very beginning while weakens gradually. The maximum value of ~1.7 μA is obtained
at the time of ~8 ms after leaving. As shown in Fig. 4.13d, when the plate moves
parallel to the photodetector array, the view angle is ﬁxed at 93°. The response of
the artiﬁcial vision system is rather stable with a maximum value of ~1.2 μA. Thus,
the artiﬁcial vision system shows good capability of recognizing the movement of
nearby objects. This research result is of great inspiration for the further realization
of intelligent activities such as collision avoidance.
Here we discuss the theoretical model in the simulation. Figure 4.14 shows the
schematic diagram illustrating the geometrical relationship between photoreceptor
array and the panel. The view angle of the object on the photodetector array is 2 · θ(t).
And there is a relationship: tanθ(t)  l/|vt|, where v and t are the object’s moving rate
and the time for collision (t < 0). Therefore, the dimension (2L) of the object edge
on the photodetector array could be written as follows: 2L  2 · n0 · tanθ(t)/tanθ0,

L’s relationship as:
L  n0 · (l/v)
|t|· tan θ0
(4.3)
Since the size of the detectors cannot be ignored, the processing circuit may
trigger new pulse stimuli only when L is an integer multiple of the detector size on
the detector array. Based on this characteristic, we can write the equation of the time
point (T) triggering pulses:

and more responding detectors and the time interval is getting shorter and shorter.
On the contrary, when objects moving far away from the photodetectors array, T
could be written as follows:

where n  N/2, N/2 −1, …, 1. It is seen that as the object disappears, there are fewer
and fewer responding detectors and the time interval is getting longer and longer.
When the object moves parallel to the detector, the size of the object on the detector
array is ﬁxed. When the object moves at a ﬁxed rate, the number (n0) of responded
detectors and the time interval is ﬁxed. Therefore, if the detector size is a, the time
interval for each response will be a/v.
Based on the above mathematical model, we performed simulation experiments
on the above three cases. The parameters used for simulation are given in Table 4.1.

Summary
Inthischapter,wediscussedthesimulationofaseriesofneuromorphiccomputational
functions based on oxide-based EDL neuromorphic transistors. In our neuromorphic
transistors, since a huge double-layer capacitance is formed only at the interface
between the gate dielectric and the channel, the gate voltage is almost entirely applied
to this interface, and there is almost no potential drop inside the electrolyte. Thus, the
electrostatic coupling effect of the EDL is hardly affected by the distance between
gate and channel [6, 14]. Based on this principle, multiple inputs can be coupled to
one channel at the same time. This mechanism provides the possibility of multi-input
dendritic integration.
Firstly, we explored the simulation of neural network parallel computing func-
tion. The dendritic integration functions as well as the modulation were successfully

implemented, and the simulated logic function was also realized by using this den-
dritic integration function. Then the simulation of the neurological function was also
realized. We used one gate as control input while the other two gates as driving inputs.
According to the two neural coding methods, the operation and regulation functions
of the control input on the neural input and output relations are tested, and the mul-
tiplication operation functions were implemented. Finally we simulated the visual
processing function. In analogue to the visual neural network, we have constructed a
three-layer visual network to perform simulations including directional adjustment
and LGMD neuron behavior.
These neuro-computing behaviors are the basis of the brain’s inspired behaviors
like pattern recognition, obstacle avoidance, and sensory processing, and they are
also the weak points of traditional digital computers. Two-terminal synaptic devices
like memristors and phase-change memories have made progress in the ﬁeld of pat-
tern recognition and position recognition. As for three-terminal synaptic devices
represented by oxide-based EDL transistor, the channel conductance could be tuned
through the capacitive electrostatic coupling of the gate. Therefore, it has more poten-
tial in implementing complex parallel processing, regulation, and calculation. From
this perspective, the simulation of these neural behaviors by the oxide double-layer
neuromorphic transistors is of great signiﬁcance for constructing a neuromorphic
computing system that can extend the computing power of existing computers.

Conclusion and Perspective
5.1
Conclusion
Human brain is one of the most exquisite computing systems with high efﬁciency and
ultralow energy consumption. Although great progress has been made in ﬂoating-
point calculation of the digital computer, brain still do better in pattern recognition,
logical deduction, self-learning and innovative thinking with limited resource. To
construct a brain-like powerful computing system, software based approaches have
been proposed. For example, AlphaGo developed by Google has beat human cham-
pion of Go—Lee Sedol, which is intelligent software based on deep learning algo-
rithm [1]. Only Go game can be mastered by AlphaGo, while 1202 CPU and 176
GPU were used. A main reason for such high resource consumption is due to the
program run on the digital sequential machine with large scale serializability and
separated computing and memory units. The computation power could be improved
by increasing the serializability which dramatically increases the complexity and
energy consumption. In that case, hardware based approaches that construct the
massive parallelism as human brain from physical level, would be of great potential
for building a brain-like computing system.
In our brain, the most basic units are synapse and neuron. To achieve a
synapse/neuron like electronic device is regarded as the key toward neuromorphic
computing system. In this thesis, oxide based electric-double-layer transistors were
proposed as a candidate for mimicking behaviors of synapse/neuron, and some neu-
romorphic computing functions were realized underneath such devices. The main
contribution of this work could be:
(1) Three kinds of electrolyte ﬁlm including nanogranular SiO2, methylcellulose
and graphene oxide, were proposed for gate dielectric. The characterizations of
all these ﬁlms showed good insulativity, e.g. only 0.6 nA leakage current was
measured in nanogranular SiO2. At the same time, all these ﬁlms exhibited good
ionic conductivity, e.g. 4.2×10−4 S/cm was achieved in methylcellulose ﬁlms.
Very large speciﬁc capacitances (>1 µF/cm2) were observed among these ﬁlms

Conclusion and Perspective
due to the EDL capacitive coupling, and the highest capacitance of 18 µF/cm2
was achieved in the graphene oxide ﬁlm. Based on the measurements, all the
three ﬁlms could be deemed as the good platform for EDL formation.
(2) Metal oxide (IZO) based transistors were designed and fabricated based on the
three gate dielectric materials. The ﬁled-effect mobility for these transistors
was higher than 20 cm2 V−1 s−1. The on/off ratio and subthreshold slope for the
nanogranular SiO2 gated transistor is as high as 2×107 and 114 mV/decade,
respectively. Such transistors possess good stability and are compatible with the
traditional CMOS technologies, which is very promising as a building block
for neuromorphic circuits/chips. Methylcellulose shows good biocompatibility,
which could be utilized for human-machine interfaces and implantable elec-
tronics. The graphene oxide gated transistors show good transistor performance
as well as ﬂexibility. In that case, such transistors could be used to fabricate
ﬂexible neuromorphic circuits/chips.
(3) Several forms of short-term plasticity were mimicked based on electrostatic
coupling of EDL using the three kinds of transistors. The short-term plastic-
ity mimicked in this work consist postsynaptic current (EPSC), paired-pulse
facilitation (PPF), spatiotemporal correlated logics and short-term memory. A
model based on proton-related electric-double-layer modulation and stretched-
exponential decay function was proposed for these emulations, and the theoret-
ical results are in good agreement with the experimentally measured synaptic
behaviors.
(4) Electrochemical doping/dedoping phenomenon was observed in the IZO synap-
tic transistors under a large gate voltage (|V|≥4.0 V). XPS measurements veri-
ﬁed that the electrochemical doping process would induce more oxygen vacancy
and increases the conductance of the IZO channel. The depoding process would
decrease the conductance on the contrary.
(5) Studies have demonstrated that the EDL capacitor is formed within a very thin
layer (~1 nm) at the interface between electrolyte and channel, therefore almost
all voltage drop were applied on such interface. Based on such theory, voltages
applied on multiple spatial-isolated gates could be jointly coupled to channel
without signiﬁcant loss through the electrolyte. IZO synaptic transistors with
multiple paralleled gates were designed and fabricated for dendritic integra-
tion. The modulation on such dendritic integration and analog logics were also
achieved by introducing a modulated gate.
(6) To mimic the visual system, we constructed an artiﬁcial visual system including
input layer, processing layer and output layer, where the oxide based synaptic
transistors were used as the output layer. Such visual system exhibited orienta-
tion selectivity to 0° edges. What’s more, we built a visual processing system
based on mathematic model of biological visual systems, which consists of a
20×20 photodetector array as input layer and synaptic transistors with multi-
ple gates as processing layer. The emulations of Lobula Giant Motion Detector
(LGMD) were demonstrated based on such system.

Perspective
Based on the aforementioned conclusions, this thesis has demonstrated achievements
on oxide-based EDL modulation and neuromorphic computing applications based
on it. However, to make a deeper understanding and to reveal more intriguing poten-
tials in this area, much more studies should be made in the future, which could be
summarized as follow:
(1) The minimum time interval of ~10 ms is limited by the measurement mode of
Keithley-4200 SCS semiconductor parameter analyzer used in all time depen-
dent electrical characterizations. However, the minimum time interval in neural
network is about millisecond. Therefore, to precisely mimic the time dependent
synapse behaviors, faster equipment is needed. At the same time, the energy
consumption of these synaptic devices would decrease with the decrease of the
time interval.
(2) As the pattern of transistors in this thesis is fabricated though shadow masks, the
device sizes thus are limited to hundreds micrometer. Therefore, the density of
the systems/circuits as well as energy consumption could be greatly decreased
by using advanced photolithography technologies.
(3) Although a theoretical model for short-term plasticity emulations has been pro-
vided, more universal and precise model should be ﬁgured out. What’s more,
deep understanding on the physical/chemical mechanisms which underlies these
emulations should be further investigated.
(4) Up to now, all the emulations were implemented based on one single synaptic
transistor with one or three inputs, and the multiple inputs and outputs synaptic
transistors haven’t realized yet. Furthermore, the interactions between these
transistors, cooperation on parallel working mode and energy consumption for
the whole integrated system would be regarded as big issues in future designs.
(5) The emulations by the synaptic transistors are still very superﬁcial, and the
emulations for more intelligent, complicate and important functions in memory,
learning and computing would be taken into account.
(6) Most of the emulations or applications in this thesis are just proof-of-concept,
how to implement these transistors for practical applications such as neuromor-
phic circuits/chips is crucial important in future studies.
