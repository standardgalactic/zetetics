Challenges
▶Artworks in diﬀerent medias, color with geometric
deformation.
▶No training data available.

Figure: (a) Nymphs Sleeping After the Hunt, Spied on by Satyr (oil);
(b) Diana’s Nymphs After the Hunt (oil); (c) Seventeen Studies of
Diﬀerent Dogs (drawing). Images are from Brueghel dataset.

Main Contribution
A self-supervised feature ﬁne-tuning for matching:
▶instance, not categories
▶across domains, e.g. engraving, oil painting. . .

Qualitative Results
Figure: One shot detection results obtained with cosine similarity with
ImageNet feature (top) and our trained features (middle) as well as
the ones obtained with our features and the discovery score (bottom).
