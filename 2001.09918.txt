Abstract
The classical double copy relates exact solutions in biadjoint scalar, gauge and gravity theo-
ries. Recently, nonperturbative solutions have been found in biadjoint theory, which have been
speculated to be related to the Wu-Yang monopole in gauge theory. We show that this seems
not to be the case, by considering monopole solutions in the inﬁnitely boosted (shockwave)
limit. Furthermore, we show that the Wu-Yang monopole is instead related to the Taub-NUT
solution, whose previously noted single copy is that of an abelian-like (Dirac) monopole. Our
results demonstrate how abelian and non-abelian gauge theory objects can be associated with
the same gravity object, and clarify a number of open questions concerning the scope of the
classical double copy.

Introduction
Field theories continue to be relevant in many diﬀerent areas of physics. Of particular interest are
relativistic quantum theories, needed for particle physics and gravity. Studying the relationships
between diﬀerent theories can be just as important as examining individual theories themselves,
given that this may reveal new conceptual insights, or computational methods. One such relation-
ship is the double copy [1–3], whose original incarnation related scattering amplitudes in non-abelian
gauge, and gravity, theories - including their supersymmetric generalisations (see refs. [2,4–46], and
ref. [47] for a comprehensive review). This was subsequently extended to classical solutions [48–83],
which has a number of applications. Firstly, there is the possibility that the double copy could
greatly streamline calculations in classical General Relativity, such as those needed for gravitational
wave physics. Secondly, extending the remit of the double copy broadens our conceptual under-
standing as to whether this is a deep and fundamental connection between diﬀerent types of ﬁeld
theory, or merely a coincidence for certain observables. If the former is true, it suggests that our
traditional way of formulating ﬁeld theories may be incomplete and / or hiding crucial underlying
features.

If the double copy is a complete relationship between gauge and gravity theories, it must somehow
be applicable to all possible types of solution. All previous examples involving amplitudes or clas-
sical solutions (exact or otherwise) involve positive powers of the coupling constants in the relevant
theories. It remains to be seen whether or not the double copy can be made truly non-perturbative,
i.e. applicable to strong-coupling solutions, containing negative powers of the coupling. As a ﬁrst
step, a recent series of papers has derived such solutions for biadjoint scalar ﬁeld theory, with
the hope of matching them with known strong-coupling solutions in gauge theory [84–86]. One
of these represents a monopole-like object, and ref. [84] speculated that this might be relatable to
the well-known Wu-Yang monopole in gauge theory [87]. However, it has remained unclear how
to systematically construct such a double copy, whose rules must in any case be fundamentally
diﬀerent to any previous case.
In this paper, we investigate the question of whether the biadjoint monopole of ref. [84] maps to
the Wu-Yang monopole, and conclude that it does not. We present two arguments, where the ﬁrst
involves inﬁnitely boosting classical solutions in the various theories we consider, and constructing
shockwave solutions from them. In gravity, this was ﬁrst considered by Aichelburg and Sexl [88],
who found that certain parameters have to be rescaled when boosting, in order to keep physically
measurable eﬀects ﬁnite. We will follow convention by referring to this general procedure as an
ultraboost in what follows. Related examples including gravity and / or gauge theory can be found
in refs. [89–94]. Certain shockwave solutions are known to double copy [32,48,95], and thus com-
paring the ultraboosted biadjoint and Wu-Yang monopole solutions allows us to conﬁrm or refute
whether or not they are connected by the double copy. Indeed, we will see that, whilst the Wu-Yang
monopole survives its ultraboost, the biadjoint monopole does not, which seems to indicate that
they are not after all related. This conclusion is not watertight, however, given that the physics in
diﬀerent theories can turn out to be very diﬀerent, even if the double copy relates them.
In the second part of our study, we thus seek to explain why we could have expected a priori that
the biadjoint and Wu-Yang monopole solutions are not related via the double copy. We recall the
existence of a singular gauge transformation that can be used to transform the Wu-Yang solution
into a non-abelian version of the Dirac magnetic monopole in electromagnetism, whose form lin-
earises the Yang-Mills equations [96,97]. The Dirac monopole is known to double copy to the pure
NUT solution in gravity. Furthermore, its counterpart in biadjoint theory is already known [49],
and does not coincide with the non-perturbative biadjoint monopole of ref. [84]. Thus, there is no
room for the non-perturbative biadjoint monopole in matching up shockwaves, which is consistent
with it not surviving in the ultraboost limit.
Despite the negative result of our investigation, it proves to be worthwhile for several reasons.
Firstly, although both static solutions and shockwaves are known to double-copy, the latter (in
gauge and biadjoint theory) have not been explicitly obtained from the former using an ultraboost
procedure in this context. The details of how to perform an ultraboost in biadjoint theory are new,
and the comparison of this procedure with its gauge and gravity counterparts proves interesting.
Secondly, the above-mentioned identiﬁcation of the Wu-Yang and Dirac monopoles indicates an
emerging picture in which both abelian- and non-abelian-like objects can double copy to the same
gravity solution, which in turn suggests that the classical double copy of ref. [48] (which always
concerns abelian-like objects in the gauge theory) is more general than previously thought. Such
2

behaviour has been seen before in the study of amplitudes [27], and is consistent with the fact that
colour information is removed when taking the double copy.
The structure of our paper is as follows. In section 2, we review salient details concerning the
classical double copy procedure of ref. [48].
In section 3, we show how to obtain shockwaves
which have previously been shown to double copy via an ultraboost procedure in biadjoint, gauge
and gravity theories. We also ﬁnd and interpret the ultraboost of the non-perturbative biadjoint
monopole of ref. [84]. In section 4, we review a known singular gauge transformation relating the
Wu-Yang and Dirac monopoles, and explain the implications of this relationship for the double
copy. Finally, in section 5, we discuss our results and conclude.

The Kerr-Schild double copy
The classical double copy of ref. [48] is a systematic procedure for relating certain exact classical
solutions in biadjoint, gauge and gravity theories. In the latter, we may deﬁne a graviton ﬁeld hµν
via
gµν = ηµν −κhµν, κ =
p
16πGN,
(1)
with gµν (ηµν) the full (Minkowski) metric with signature (+, −, −, −), and GN the Newton con-
stant. We may then consider the family of Kerr-Schild solutions, for which the graviton has the
special form
hµν = κ
2φ kµkν,
(2)
where φ is a harmonic function, and the Kerr-Schild vector kµ is geodesic, and null with respect to
either the Minkowski or full metrics:
k · ∂kµ = 0,
gµνkµkν = ηµνkµkν = 0.
(3)
Upon substituting the ansatz of eq. (2) into the Einstein equations, they linearise, such that eq. (2)
represents an exact solution that is particularly tractable. Given the quantities φ and kµ appearing
in eq. (2), one may construct a non-abelian gauge ﬁeld
Aµ ≡Aa
µTa,
Aa
µ = caφkµ,
(4)
where Ta is a generator of the gauge group with adjoint index a, and ca an arbitrary colour vector.
Reference [48] proved that for any time-independent Kerr-Schild solution, the gauge ﬁeld of eq. (4)
satisifes the linearised Yang-Mills equations, and thus represents an exact physical solution of a
non-abelian gauge theory. Note that the procedure for obtaining Aa
µ is simply to replace one copy
of the Kerr-Schild vector kµ with the colour vector ca (correspondingly, a spacetime index of the
ﬁeld hµν is replaced with a colour index in the ﬁeld Aa
µ). One may repeat this procedure, so as to
obtain a ﬁeld
Φ = Φaa′Ta ˜Ta′,
Φaa′ = ca˜ca′φ,
(5)
where ˜ca′ is a second colour vector, that is potentially associated with a diﬀerent gauge group to
that of ca. As shown in ref. [48], eq. (5) is a solution of a linearisation of the biadjoint scalar ﬁeld
equation

where λ is a coupling constant, and {fabc}, { ˜fa′b′c′} are sets of structure constants associated with
the two Lie groups. Starting with a time-independent Kerr-Schild solution, we thus obtain solutions
in a ladder of diﬀerent ﬁeld theories, as depicted in ﬁgure 1, where for convenience we also display
the name of the map between any given two types of theory 4.
The above situation mirrors the existence of similar double copy relations between amplitudes in
these theories, such that our current understanding is that the classical and amplitude double
copies are manifestations of the same underlying correspondence, and indeed overlap where rele-
vant [48–50,101,102]. Despite this, a number of open questions exist regarding the classical double
copy. Firstly, there is the issue of whether arbitrary sources, as well as the ﬁelds themselves, can
be furnished with a double-copy interpretation [50,79,103,104]. This is an interesting issue, which
we will not explore in this paper. Secondly, the family of time-independent Kerr-Schild metrics
is clearly very special, and a number of studies have tried to go beyond this. Regarding time de-
pendence, ref. [48] pointed out that certain inﬁnite boosted (shockwave) solutions [88,105], whose
correspondence in gauge and gravity theories was ﬁrst noted in ref. [95], can also be phrased in
terms of the Kerr-Schild double copy. The case of an arbitrarily accelerating point particle was
considered in ref. [50], and related to known scattering amplitudes for gluons and gravitons in the
Bremsstrahlung limit. Generalisation from time translation invariance to an arbitrary Killing vector
was considered in ref. [104]. There have also been attempts to move beyond the simple Kerr-Schild
form. Reference [49] considered the Taub-NUT solution in gravity, which has a double Kerr-Schild
form, in which the graviton contains two terms of the form of eq. (2), involving diﬀerent harmonic
functions and Kerr-Schild vectors. The latter obey certain mutual orthogonality conditions, but
this is no longer suﬃcient to linearise the Einstein equations in general. Remarkably, linearisation
still occurs for the special case of Taub-NUT [106], and the single copy is found to be a point-like
dyon, carrying both electric and magnetic charge 5. More generally, one may consider the classi-
cal double copy of non-Kerr-Schild solutions, but at the price of having to work order-by-order in
perturbation theory [51,61,63–65]. Thus, Kerr-Schild coordinates are not a fundamental prequisite
for being able to construct a classical double copy. Rather, they constitute a maximally convenient
case, in which it is possible to make statements to all orders in perturbation theory 6.
4Figure 1 is not the whole story, but forms a subset of an ever-increasing web of theories related by double-copy-like
transformations. See e.g. refs. [47,98–100] for further details.
5Recently, the known electromagnetic duality relating electric and magnetic charges has been explored from a
double copy point of view [83,107,108].
6A related programme of work has shown that a classical double copy is possible in arbitrary coordinate systems,
if one restricts to linearised level only [52–56,59,60,109].
4

A third puzzle regarding the Kerr-Schild double copy concerns the fact that the single copy of
the gravity solution is always abelian-like, in that it linearises the Yang-Mills equations (n.b. the
gauge theory solution is still formally non-abelian, in that it is dressed by the colour dependence of
eq. (4)). Whilst this follows from the mathematical arguments of ref. [48], this situation is slightly
at odds with the double copy story for amplitudes, in which the non-abelian nature of the gauge
theory plays a pivotal role, through the so-called BCJ duality [1] relating colour and kinematic
information. It would perhaps be more desirable if one could associate fully non-linear solutions in
the gauge theory with gravitational counterparts, and there is also the possibility that both abelian-
like and fully non-linear solutions in the gauge theory may map to the same gravity solution. There
is in fact a precedent for this in an amplitudes context [27], and we will return to this in what follows.
Before moving on, it is worth providing those examples of the Kerr-Schild double copy that we will
later rely on. Arguably the simplest example is that of a pointlike mass sourcing a Schwarzschild
black hole, for which the quantities appearing in eq. (2) are given by
φ = M
4πr,
kµ =

1, x
r

,
(7)
where x = (x, y, z) is the radial position vector in Cartesian coordinates. The single copy of this is
a point charge at the origin, given by
Aa
µ = gca
4πrkµ,
(8)
and the zeroth copy is then
Φaa′ = λca˜ca′
4πr .
(9)
Another case we will utilise is that of the Aichelburg-Sexl solution in gravity, representing a shock-
wave moving along the x direction at the speed of light, and such that the gravitational impulse
imparted to a stationary test particle is ﬁnite [88]. This has a Kerr-Schild form, with:
φ = −M
4π log
 ρ

δ(u),
kµ = (1, −1, 0, 0),
(10)
where
u = t −x
(11)
is a light-cone coordinate,
ρ =
p
y2 + z2
(12)
the cylindrical radius as measured from the x axis, ρ0 an arbitrary constant, and the vector kµ is
again expressed in Cartesian coordinates. The single copy of this solution is a non-abelian plane
wave [105]
Aa
µ = −gca
4π log
 ρ

δ(u)kµ,
(13)
and there is also a corresponding biadjoint zeroth copy
Φaa′ = −λca˜ca′
4π
log
 ρ
ρ0

δ(u).
(14)
5

In each theory, the factor δ(u) conﬁnes the inﬂuence of the ﬁeld to a plane transverse to the x-
direction, moving at light speed. There is a non-trival proﬁle function, which depends only on the
transverse coordinates (y, z) 7.
All of the above examples involve positive powers of the coupling constants in the biadjoint, gauge
or gravity theories.
It remains unknown whether or not the double copy can be extended to
non-perturbative solutions, involving inverse powers of the coupling. Solutions of the biadjoint
theory play a crucial role in both the amplitude and Kerr-Schild double copies [48]. Thus, it seems
natural to assume that this should also be the case in a nonperturbative correspondence, should the
latter exist. To this end, refs. [84–86] initiated the programme of cataloguing non-linear solutions
of biadjoint theory.
The simplest such solution has the form of a static spherically symmetric
monopole-like object residing at the origin of spacetime:
Φaa′ = −2δaa′
λTAr2 ,
(15)
where it is assumed that both Lie groups in the biadjoint theory are the same, and the constant
TA is deﬁned in terms of the structure constants via
fabcfa′bc = δaa′TA.
(16)
For the speciﬁc case in which the common gauge group is SU(2), there is also a continuous family
of solutions given by

(17)
There was already some speculation in ref. [84] about whether any of these solutions could be
related to pointlike objects in non-abelian gauge theory. In the case of SU(2), a natural candidate
is the Wu-Yang monopole of ref. [87], which in a particular gauge takes the form
Aa
0 = 0,
Aa
i = −ϵiakxk
gr2 ,
(18)
where g is the coupling constant. Like the solutions of eq. (15, 17), this contains an inverse power
of the coupling, and also has a pure power-like dependence in the spherical radius r, where the
power itself can be dictated on dimensional grounds 8. Given the lack of any precedent for how
to formulate a non-perturbative double copy, ref. [48] left as merely speculative the suggestion
that the biadjoint monopoles of eqs. (15, 17) are related to the Wu-Yang monopole.
Our aim
here is to examine this systematically, and the starting point will be the above-mentioned fact
that shockwave solutions are known to double copy. By ultraboosting the biadjoint monopole, it
may turn out to have properties corresponding to a known shockwave, or exhibit other simplifying
features that enable a suitable double copy interpretation to be obtained. If it instead does not
survive the ultraboost, then this is evidence that the speculative link between the biadjoint and
Wu-Yang monopoles may in fact be incorrect.
7The above shockwave solutions provide a nice link between the classical and amplitude double copies: the gauge
and gravity shockwaves were constructed from an all-order Feynman diagram analysis in ref. [32].
8Note that g in the gauge theory is dimensionless in four spacetime dimensions, whereas the coupling constant λ
in eq. (6) has dimensions of mass.

Shockwaves and ultraboosts
Above, we have suggested ultraboosting monopole solutions in biadjoint and gauge theories, in
order to see what can be learned about the possible existence of a nonperturbative double copy.
Before considering the case of the biadjoint monopole, however, it pays to revisit the Aichelburg-
Sexl family of shockwaves, written here in eqs. (10, 13, 14). We will recast the ultraboost procedure
of ref. [88] using Kerr-Schild coordinates, so that double copy properties are manifest. This will also
allow us to examine the ultraboost in the biadjoint scalar theory, which has not been previously
considered.
3.1
The Aichelburg-Sexl shockwave in Kerr-Schild coordinates
Let us begin with the point mass (Schwarzschild) solution of eqs. (2, 7), taken to be stationary
in an inertial frame S′ with Cartesian coordinates (t′, x′, y′, z′). We may then consider that S′ is
moving with boost parameter β ≡v (in natural units) in the +x direction relative to a second
frame S whose coordinates are (t, x, y, z). The two sets of coordinates are related by the Lorentz
transformation

where the function φ and Kerr-Schild vector are given in terms of the primed coordinates by eq. (7).

(20)
To look for a shockwave solution, we must take the limit γ →∞, whilst also regularising the
solution so that physically measurable quantities are ﬁnite. One such quantity is the deﬂection of a
test particle upon crossing the shockwave, which is linear in the ﬁeld. Thus, we require that hµν is
ﬁnite in the ultraboost limit. However, the limiting procedure itself is rather subtle, given that one
ﬁnds diﬀerent results for the limiting values of the quantities in eq. (20) depending upon whether
one is inside (x = βt) or outside (x ̸= βt) the plane of the shockwave. For the former case one
obtains

(24)
It is clear that things are badly divergent, both on and oﬀthe plane, which makes physical sense:
boosting a massive particle to light speed requires inﬁnite energy, and thus will result in a divergent
ﬁeld conﬁguration! The transition to a ﬁnite shockwave solution proceeds as follows [88]. First,
one may rescale the mass9 according to
M →M
γ .
(25)
Then the graviton ﬁeld of eq. (24) remains inﬁnite inside the plane x = βt, but not outside it.
This suggests that the ultraboosted ﬁeld could indeed contain a delta function δ(u), localising the
extent of the ﬁeld to the shockwave plane only. To recognise the delta function, we may reinstate
the γ-dependence for the ﬁeld near the shockwave plane, writing this as

for expressing a Dirac delta function as the limit of a delta sequence f(u), namely a function that
can be continuously transformed to make an inﬁnitely sharp peak at u = 0. In the present case,
we may identify
f(u) = M
4π
1
(u2 + ρ2)1/2 ,
(28)
such that eq. (27) indeed corresponds to taking the limit of the prefactor in eq. (26). However,
application of eq. (27) then fails due to the fact that the integral on the right-hand side is not
convergent. We will interpret the physics of this shortly, but for now note that we can modify the
function f(u) according to 10

9In the literature this rescaling is noted to keep the energy ﬁnite whilst taking the rest mass to zero. Physically
one may view this as a necessary step in changing description between a massive and a massless particle.

graviton ﬁeld.

which is precisely the Aichelburg-Sexl shockwave of eq. (10). We can now interpret the divergence
that appeared in trying to apply eq. (27) to the original function of eq. (28): its regularisation
merely amounts to introducing an overall constant, that sets the scale of the logarithmic prefactor
in eq. (32), and which has to be present on dimensional grounds. It has no physical consequences,
given that deﬂections of test particles depend only upon derivatives of the metric.
Note that in Kerr-Schild coordinates, the combination of the mass rescaling and regularisation pro-
cedures can be rephrased in a particularly simple form. The correct ultraboost of the Schwarzschild
solution to form an Aichelburg-Sexl shockwave consists of the following two steps:
(i) One must rescale the mass parameter according to eq. (25).
(ii) One must modify the boosted Kerr-Schild function in eq. (20) according to

(33)
This is slightly diﬀerent to the above analysis, in that one modiﬁes the φ function before taking
the limit γ →∞. Importantly, this modiﬁcation maintains the fact that φ is harmonic, so that the
Kerr-Schild conditions still apply. Repeating the above analysis yields eq. (32) as before 11. By
modifying φ itself, however, we have cast the ultraboost procedure into a form which has a natural
counterpart under the single and zeroth copies.
3.2
Single and zeroth copies
In the previous section, we have given an explicit procedure for ultraboosting a point mass in Kerr-
Schild coordinates. We may carry out a similar procedure for the point charge in a gauge theory,
11An advantage of this alternative way of formulating the ultraboost is that the boosted ﬁeld manifestly vanishes
oﬀof the shockwave plane, in contrast to eq. (24). Indeed, the latter behaviour is associated with the fact that the
original φ function could not be used to form a delta sequence.

for which one may start with the single copy of the Schwarzschild solution in the primed coordinate
system, and boost it to obtain the following gauge ﬁeld:
Aµ = φ kµ.
(34)
Here φ is given by the function of eq. (20), but with the mass replaced by the colour charge caTa,
and kµ is also given in eq. (20). For the ultraboost, we may again modify φ according to eq. (33),
after which we ﬁnd the following limit:

where ¯kµ has been deﬁned in eq. (22). This is precisely the form of the gauge theory shockwaves
considered in refs. [32, 105] (see also ref. [93] for an interesting discussion of gauge theory shock-
waves in a diﬀerent context). Note that to obtain a ﬁnite ﬁeld conﬁguration, there is no need to
rescale the charge, as was needed for the mass parameter in the gravity theory. We will return to
this point below.
For the zeroth copy, we may simply consider the biadjoint ﬁeld (in the primed coordinate system)
Φaa′ = λca˜ca′
4πr′ .

where in order to achieve a non-vanishing ﬁeld conﬁguration, we must rescale the charges as shown.
Upon doing so, the shockwave solutions of eqs. (32, 35, 37) are related directly by the usual single
and zeroth copy procedures. That is, one may write eq. (32) in the form
hµν = κ

where ¯kµ (from eq. (22)) is indeed null and geodesic, and ¯φ harmonic. The single and zeroth copies
imply that one must remove factors of ¯kµ, and replace mass with charge accordingly, leading di-
rectly to eqs. (35) and (37). We can also make sense, from a double copy point of view, of the
modiﬁcation of eq. (33). As stressed in ref. [48], the function φ in eq. (2) can be interpreted as a
scalar propagator, and is analogous to the denominator factors in amplitudes, which are not mod-
iﬁed upon taking the double copy from gauge theory to gravity. In the present case, the function
¯φ that we arrive at after the ultraboost is indeed the known propagator in two spatial dimen-
sions (i.e. corresponding to the transverse plane), and the modiﬁcation of eq. (33) is necessary
so as to construct the most general form of the propagator by including the constant ρ0. This in
turn explains why eq. (33) is necessary when performing ultraboosts in all three theories of ﬁgure 1.
Above, we have seen that diﬀerent scalings of mass / charge parameters in diﬀerent theories are nec-
essary, to obtain a ﬁnite ﬁeld. The sources for the biadjoint, gauge and gravity theories respectively

The rescalings act on the parameters entering these source terms, and we summarise the diﬀerent

calculating the impulse

Furthermore, it does not depend on the constant ρ0, justifying the remarks made above. For the

(46)
12The shockwave proﬁle diverges at y = z = 0, so that we must place the test particle elsewhere.
11

In all cases, the impulses are ﬁnite, which indeed is entirely consistent with the fact that the rescal-
ings of table 1 were such as to make the proﬁles of the ﬁelds in the shockwave plane ﬁnite: the three
force laws of eqs. (41, 43, 45) are all linear in their respective ﬁelds 13. Turning this around, we
can use physical ﬁniteness of the impulses to dictate the rescaling needed in each theory, and the
power of γ needed to rescale the parameters of the ﬁeld can then simply be traced to the number
of factors of the the Kerr-Schild vector each ﬁeld contains, and hence its spin.
In this section, we have shown how the ultraboost procedure can be implemented in biadjoint, gauge
and gravity theories, so as to be fully compliant with the double copy. We focused on point charges
or masses that are solutions of the linearised ﬁeld equations in each case (up to a source term
localised at the origin). In all cases, the charges survived the ultraboost, resulting in a well-deﬁned
shockwave solution that could be meaningfully mapped between theories as in ﬁgure 1. Armed with
this experience, let us now see what happens if we try to ultraboost the non-perturbative biadjoint
monopole.
3.3
Ultraboosting the biadjoint monopole
Starting with the solution of eq. (15) in the rest frame S′, we may boost to the unprimed frame to
obtain
Φaa′ = −2δaa′
λTA
1
[γ2(x −βt)2 + ρ2].
(47)
Taking the ultraboost limit, one ﬁnds
Φaa′
γ→∞
−−−→−2δaa′
λTA
(

ρ2 ,
x = βt
O(γ−2),
x ̸= βt.
(48)
Due to the diﬀerent dependence on the radial coordinate, this does not diverge on the transverse
plane, in contrast to the boosted point charge considered in the previous section. Without this
divergence, eq. (48) does not constitute a shockwave: it is at most a tepid ripple. That is, it imparts
no ﬁnite impulse to a test particle, given that a ﬁnite ﬁeld is conﬁned to an inﬁnitely thin plane.
It is interesting to note that one could still obtain a shockwave by rescaling the coupling λ in
eq. (48). Carrying out a similar analysis to the previous section, one may show that
Φaa′
γ→∞, λ→γ−1λ
−−−−−−−−−→−2δaa′
λTA

ρδ(u),
(49)
which does indeed exert a ﬁnite impulse. However, the nature of this rescaling is very diﬀerent to
that of the boosted point charges considered earlier. In the latter cases, the parameters entering
the source terms (i.e. masses and charges) were rescaled, which does not change the ﬁeld equations
themselves. Rescaling the coupling for the non-perturbative monopole, however, does indeed con-
stitute changing the ﬁeld equations, and hence the theory 14.
13It is worth pointing out that diﬀerent physical quantities may require diﬀerent scalings upon performing an
ultraboost, such as the non-linear electromagnetic interactions considered in ref. [93].
14Coupling constants are of course not constant when quantum corrections are included, leading to renormalisation.
But that is not what is happening here.
12

Based on the above considerations, we conservatively conclude that the non-perturbative biadjoint
monopole does not survive an ultraboost. Similar considerations are reached for the more general
monopoles of eq. (17), as we show in appendix B. There are then two possibilities as regards a po-
tential non-perturbative double copy, and in particular the suggestion that the biadjoint monopole
could be related to a Wu-Yang monopole in gauge theory. The ﬁrst is that the two objects are
indeed related, but that the physics of ultraboosting is potentially very diﬀerent in the two theories,
such that the biadjoint monopole disappears. Whether or not the Wu-Yang monopole survives an
ultraboost is irrelevant for the argument. The second possibility is that the biadjoint monopole
disappears because it does not need to match up with a known shockwave solution, and in partic-
ular is not related to the Wu-Yang monopole. In the next section, we will explain why it is in fact
this second possibility that appears to be correct.
4
Relating the Wu-Yang and Dirac monopoles
Above, we saw that the failure of the biadjoint monopole to survive its ultraboost is possible evi-
dence for its not being related to the Wu-Yang monopole after all, contrary to the speculation of
ref. [84]. We now explain why this must be the case, and our explanation will itself provide new
insights into the remit of the classical double copy itself.
First, we recall that there is a gauge transformation that relates the Wu-Yang monopole in SU(2)
gauge theory to a non-abelian embedding of the Dirac monopole, as noted in refs. [96,97] 15. By
the latter, we mean a gauge ﬁeld of the form
Aa
µ = caADirac

(50)
where ca is a constant colour vector as usual, and
ADirac

˜gx


(51)
is a solution of the Maxwell equations corresponding to a Dirac (magnetic) monopole of charge ˜g.
This has a well-known string singularity, which we have chosen to extend from the origin along
the −z direction. Note that eq. (51) is reminiscent of the single copy solutions in the Kerr-Schild
double copy, in that it is manifestly of a form which linearises the Yang-Mills equations. We may
thus refer to this solution as abelian-like, even though it is not, strictly speaking, a solution of an
abelian gauge theory.
Without loss of generality for the following arguments, we may choose the constant colour vector
to lie in the 3-direction in the internal space, so that ca = δa3. Given that we are focusing on an
SU(2) gauge group, we may thus write the complete (matrix-valued) gauge ﬁeld as
Aµ = ADirac

(52)
where
σi = 1

Finally, transforming back to Cartesian coordinates, one ﬁnds

such that using eq. (57) returns precisely the Wu-Yang form of eq. (18). This is distinctly diﬀerent
from the abelian-like form of eq. (50): the Levi-Cevita symbol mixes the spatial and gauge indices.
In addition, the form of eq. (60) no longer linearises the Yang-Mills equations, thus is genuinely
non-abelian in this gauge 18.
This result immediately explains why the analysis of section 3 failed to ﬁnd conclusive evidence
that the ultraboosted biadjoint monopole could be potentially matched with a Wu-Yang monopole:
the Wu-Yang monopole is nothing other than the abelian-like Dirac monopole in disguise. In the
Kerr-Schild double copy, the latter is known to be related to the NUT solution in gravity [49]. The
ultraboosted Dirac monopole then double copies to a so-called NUT wave [94]. We may conﬁrm
16Equation (57) is deﬁned up to an overall constant, which is ﬁxed by stability of the monopole [96], and irrelevant
for the present argument.
17Our presentation diﬀers from that of ref. [96] due to our choice of Hermitian, rather than anti-Hermitian, gener-
ators.
18The fact that one can gauge away the non-abelian nature of the monopole may be related to its static nature [112].
14

this explicitly, by taking the gauge ﬁeld of eq. (52) to be static in the inertial frame S′ of section 3,
and boosting to the frame S of eq. (19). The result is

(63)
This has the form of a delta function in the lightcone coordinate u, dressed by a proﬁle function φM
whose dependence is only on the coordinates in the transverse plane, thus is indeed a shockwave.
Note that the function φM has a cut in the (y, z) plane, that is a remnant of the original Dirac
string. As for the latter, we may choose where to place this cut in the shockwave plane, by per-
forming gauge transformations. This would aﬀect the constant term in eq. (63), which is therefore
not physical by itself.
We may also note that the function φM is harmonic, and that ¯kµ (as has already been pointed out
above) is null and geodesic. Following the rules of ref. [48], we are thus entitled to take the double
copy of eq. (62) to obtain the graviton

where we have replace the magnetic monopole charge ˜g with a gravitational charge N.

identifying the latter with NUT charge, eq. (64) agrees with the NUT wave solution ﬁrst derived
in ref. [94] 19. We may also take the zeroth copy of eq. (62), to obtain a biadjoint scalar ﬁeld
Φaa′ = λca˜ca′ 

(65)
This is clearly non-zero, and thus not at all identiﬁable with the ultraboost of the non-perturbative
monopole of eq. (15), which eﬀectively vanished!
The results of this section are of interest in extending the remit of the classical double copy. A
frequently encountered question amongst newcomers to the subject is why the Kerr-Schild double
copy should always produce an abelian-like solution, when the amplitude double copy crucially
relies on the fact that the gauge theory is non-abelian (i.e. through BCJ duality [1]). The natural
interpretation of the above results, however, is that one may identify the NUT solution in gravity
as a double copy either of the abelian-like magnetic monopole of eq. (52), or the fully non-abelian
Wu-Yang monopole of eq. (18). That this is possible is due to the fact that colour information is

stripped oﬀwhen taking the double copy, and the overall scheme is as depicted in ﬁgure 2. Inter-
estingly, a similar picture already has a precedent in the study of scattering amplitudes: ref. [27]
examined the infrared singularities of amplitudes in either QED or QCD, and showed that these
both matched up with the same structure of IR singularities in GR, to all orders in perturbation
theory. Furthermore, it is certainly the case that non-abelian classical solutions can be constructed
perturbatively, and double copied [51,61,63]. However, we believe that our results constitute the
ﬁrst example of an exact non-abelian solution that can be double copied to a gravitational coun-
terpart, and the extension of this to other gauge groups and solutions deserves further investigation.

Conclusion
In this paper, we have systematically investigated the possibility of a non-perturbative double copy
between gauge and gravity theories. More speciﬁcally, we have followed the suggestion that the
non-perturbative biadjoint monopole of ref. [84] may be related to the singular Wu-Yang monopole
solution in SU(2) gauge theory. There is no existing guidance on how to proceed, given that in
all previous examples of the double copy, solutions of the linearised biadjoint ﬁeld equation play a
crucial role. For amplitudes, these are the denominator factors that act as scalar propagators. For
the Kerr-Schild double copy, one relies upon a harmonic function φ, that remains untouched (up
to replacements of charge and mass factors) when moving between theories.
Our starting point was to note that shockwaves are known to double-copy, and that one can con-
struct such solutions by ultraboosting static objects, by analogy with the seminal gravity study
of ref. [88]. Furthermore, ultraboosting a solution results in a somewhat simpler structure, which
might make it easier to spot how a nonperturbative double copy might work. To this end, we ﬁrst
showed how the Aichelburg-Sexl procedure, for the point charge and mass solutions considered in
19In order to compare with ref. [94], one must change the boost direction to the +z direction, and also move the
position of the cut of the function φM in the transverse plane.
16

the original classical double copy of ref. [48], can be expressed in a form that makes the double
copy manifest. This exercise was useful in itself: the ultraboost procedure has not been previously
considered in biadjoint theory, and there are interesting aspects of how the double copy relates
the ultraboosts in diﬀerent theories (e.g. the need to rescale the charge parameters diﬀerently).
Returning to the biadjoint monopole, we found that this eﬀectively vanished upon performing an
ultraboost, making any attempt to match it up with a gauge theory solution diﬃcult.
We then explained the above observations by noting that the Wu-Yang monopole is related to
a trivially dressed Dirac monopole by a (singular) gauge transformation. The latter, as implied
by the study of ref. [49], maps to the well-known NUT solution in gravity. Consequently, upon
ultraboosting the transformed Wu-Yang monopole, one may double copy the result to obtain the
so-called NUT wave of ref. [94], which we veriﬁed by explicit calculation. Interestingly, we expressed
the Dirac monopole in a gauge that was not in the right form for the usual Kerr-Schild double copy
(e.g. the ﬁeld was not null). However, the shockwaves we obtained were indeed of Kerr-Schild
form, which may possibly be due to the highly constrained symmetry of the shockwave solutions.
In addition, this then allowed us to take the zeroth copy of the boosted Dirac monopole, which is
non-zero and thus not relatable to the biadjoint monopoles of ref. [84].
Our results provide a number of insights at the frontier of understanding of the remit of the
double copy.
Most signiﬁcantly, we have uncovered the ﬁrst example of an exact non-abelian
solution - the Wu-Yang monopole - that can be identiﬁed with the same gravity solution as an
abelian-like counterpart. This is analogous to similar behaviour observed in the study of scattering
amplitudes [27], and indeed suggests that many more such examples can be found.
This may
provide clues about how to double copy exact non-abelian solutions without having to rely on the
Kerr-Schild procedure, which would in turn greatly increase our understanding of the fundamental
origin of the double copy itself.

(74)
This is identical (setting aside couplings and charges) to the biadjoint case.
If the interacting
particle were to have the same charge as that producing the shockwave, the eﬀect of the impulse
would be to send the particle away from the shockwave nucleus. Opposite charges would result in
the particle being drawn in closer to the nucleus. The strength of the push or pull depends on how
far the particle is initially from the source of the shockwave. The closer the initial separation, the
stronger the impulse.

The particle gets a kick restricted to the y −z plane, with the magnitude of the kick diminishing
the further the particle is from the nucleus of the shockwave. We would expect, as gravity is an
attractive force, that the impulse should draw the particle toward the nucleus of the shockwave.
By contrast, the gauge theory case is repulsive (provided c2 · c is positive in eq. (74)), which results
in the sign diﬀerence between eq. (74) and eq. (80).

Ultraboosting the general SU(2)×SU(2) Monopole
In section 3.3, we ultraboosted the biadjoint monopole solution of eq. (15), ﬁnding that it disappears
in the ultrarelativistic limit. In this appendix, we show that a similar conclusion is reached for the
more general monopole solutions of eq. (17), that were are also derived in ref. [84]. Recall that
these solutions have the form
Φaa′ =
1
λr2
"
−k
 
δaa′ −xaxa′
r2
!
±
p
2k −k2 ϵaa′dxd
r
#
,
0 ≤k ≤2.
Intermediate details of the ultraboost calculation are cumbersome due to selecting a particular
boost direction, so we will simply quote the results. As in section 3.3, we boost in the x-direction,
and examine the behaviour of the boosted solution inside and outside the plane x = βt. Outside
of the plane, we ﬁnd that the solution vanishes completely:
Φaa′
γ→∞
−−−→0
for x −βt ̸= 0.
Inside of the plane, just as for the ultraboost of the (48), the ﬁeld takes ﬁnite values and displays
no divergent behaviour. More speciﬁcally, in the limit γ →∞we ﬁnd
Φ11 →
−k
λ(y2 + z2),
Φ22 →
−kz2
λ(y2 + z2)2 ,
Φ33 →
−ky2
λ(y2 + z2)2 ,
Φ12 = −Φ21 →z
p
(k2 −2k)
λ(y2 + z2)3/2 ,
Φ13 = −Φ31 →−y
p
(k2 −2k)
λ(y2 + z2)3/2 ,
Φ23 = Φ32 →
yzk
λ(y2 + z2)2 .
We thus conclude that, similarly to (48), the solutions of eq. (17) remain ﬁnite in the plane x = βt
after the ultraboost (i.e. do not produce a delta function). Thus, they do not constitute shockwaves.
Similarly to (15), one can produce a shockwave solution by rescaling the coupling according to
λ →λ/γ. As mentioned below (49) however, this entails changing the theory, and is not analogous
to the Aichelburg-Sexl-like rescalings, which aﬀect the charges of the objects being boosted.
