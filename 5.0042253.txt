Abstract: The social sustainability is one of the three pillars of the sustainable development. In the article the 
respective domain ontology is developed as a part of the existing ontological metamodel of the sustainable 
development. Ⱥ methodology for the ontology building is proposed including concept exploration, controlled 
vocabulary and thesaurus creating; ontology formalization, verification, querying and publication. The main concepts 
of the ontology are extracted from a text corpus covering well-established and authoritative sources, approved articles, 
standards and commonly accepted regulations of United Nations. For the purpose, manual selection and automatic text 
mining by the language processing toolkit GATE is performed. The ontology is formalized by OWL in Protégé 
environment and after verification its code in GitHub is published. 
 
INTRODUCTION 
The Sustainable Development (SD) has three basic pillars – economical, environmental and social 
sustainability. The mutual links between them exist and then there is a problem about terminology clarifying. For 
the problem solving, modeling methods are used. Depending on the methods, the modeling of SD, as the modeling 
of many other systems and processes, can be ontological, mathematical, informational and economic. 
Increasingly, the ontological modeling precedes the development in any knowledge area. The corresponding 
ontology is a conceptual basis for concrete application in each area. An ontology is a tool for formal knowledge 
representation and machine-understandable knowledge generation. 
Konys (2018) asserts that there is a lack of knowledge systematization in SD field. Moreover, the social 
sustainability is an often overlooked aspect of sustainability, as sustainable development discussions often focus 
on the environmental or economic aspects of sustainability (ADEC Innovations, 2020)  
In the current work a domain Ontology of Social SD (OSSD) is proposed as a part of the ontological 
metamodel of SD. The need of OSSD arises with respect to the need of ambiguous interpretation of its inherent 
terminology. Eizenberg and Jabareen (2017) assert that “there is a lack of theoretical and empirical studies 
regarding social sustainability”. Many authors (Littig, Griessler 2005; Kunz 2006; Cuthill 2010; Dempsey et al. 
2011; Missimer, Robèrt, Broman 2017a) claim that the Social Sustainable Development (SSD) is often considered 
the least developed dimension of the SD. Initially, SSD was defined at global and national levels, but after a short 
period of time, the concept started to be adopted and used by cities, communities, and, finally, by different 
organizations (Haghi and Zabihi 2012). Other authors (Marinova, Todorov, Hossain 2015; Todorov et al. 2018) 
emphasize the role of the active civil position of the individual as a particularly important focus of the social 
dimension of SD and actively develop the features of civilization, culture and traditions in the aspect of SSD. 
Most authors (Weingaertner, Moberg 2011; Eizenberg, Jabareen 2017; Rasouli, Kumarasuriyar 2016; Ivanova, 
Obretenova 2018) agree that, as one of the three main pillars, the social sustainability should resolve issues related 
to equity, diversity, social cohesion, quality of life, democracy and governance, etc. 
The next section is a review of the state-of-the-art referring to ontologies in SD area and particularly – in SSD 
area. A methodology for creating OSSD in the third section is represented including OSSD concepts and range 
definition; controlled vocabulary and thesaurus building; ontology formalization. The SSD links to other scientific 
and practical areas are explored. The fourth section includes description of the OSSD verification, querying and 
publishing. In the conclusions, a summary of the outcomes and the future investigations are discussed.

STATE-OF-THE ARTS 
A significant achievement on the ontological modeling of SD is the Sustainable Development Goals Interface 
Ontology (SDGIO), elaborated by Inter-Agency Expert Group on Sustainable Development Goals (IAEG-SDG) 
of UN in 2016-2017 (Jensen 2017). SDGIO comprises the concepts related to the three pillars and the defined 17 
goals of SD. For its part, each of these goals comprises some number of targets (generally, 169). 
Ivanova, Deliyska and Todorov (2018) developed a domain ontology of SD in economy (OSDE) and later 
they proposed an ontological framework (metamodel) of SD (Deliyska, Ivanova, Todorov 2020) including 
Common Ontology of SD (COSD) as a top part of the metamodel.  
No domain ontology of SSD was found, but there are some applied ontologies of SSD: SD-based social 
ontology within a university system (Bankole, Fidelis, Alfred 2017; Awuse, Emuze, Ngove 2017), Strongly 
Sustainable Business Models Ontology (Upward, Jones 2015), Social Ontology of Sustainability of Construction 
Projects (Edum-Fotwe, Price 2009), ontology of sustainable manufacturing (Giovannini, et al. 2012).  
METHODOLOGY FOR OSSD CREATION 
In terms of informatics, an ontology is a software describing a given knowledge area as hierarchical scheme 
of its accepted concepts (classes), their components, semantic dependencies and rules. The methodology follows 
the main steps of building any ontology defining main concept and the range of the ontology; text corpus 
composition and extraction of the concepts in the area; controlled vocabulary and thesaurus compilation; ontology 
formalization.  
Defining Main Concept and Range of OSSD 
Obviously, the main concept of this ontology is SSD (with synonyms: sustainability of the society, social 
sustainability, sustainable development of the society). From the system theory point of view, SSD is a process 
and a state of the society systems, which are characterized by their long-term cycle and have a distant, most often 
– century-old horizon. On the ontological point of view, SSD is externally related to the main concept SD of the 
Common Ontology of Sustainable Development (COSD) (Deliyska, Ivanova, Todorov 2020), as well as with the 
Ontology of System (including Ontology of Process) (Deliyska, Manoilov 2015), OSDE (Deliyska, Ivanova, 
Todorov 2020) and an Ontology of Environmental Sustainable Development.  
 
FIGURE 1. External links of ontology of social SD (own source) 
There are many definitions of SSD, both in the sciences and in the practice, but none of them is generally 
accepted. Moreover, Eizenberg and Jabareen (2017) assert that “…social sustainability lacks a coherent, clear and 
utilizable definition”. The purpose of SSD definition should be both theoretical and practical (De Fine Licht, 
Folland 2019). The most known and cited definitions are that SSD is:  
x 
“the ability of a community to develop processes and structures which not only meet the needs of its 
current members but also support the ability of future generations to maintain a healthy community” 
(Business Dictionary, 2020); 
x 
“a positive condition within communities, and a process within communities that can achieve that 
condition.” and …“occurs when the formal and informal processes; systems; structures; and relationships 
110006-2

actively support the capacity of current and future generations to create healthy and livable communities. 
Socially sustainable communities are equitable, diverse, connected and democratic and provide a good 
quality of life.” (McKenzie 2004); 
x 
“long-term relationships among nature and society which lead to the viability of society” (Becker, Jahn 
1999).  
Polèse and Stren (2000) defined SSD as “a development which is able to occur by balancing the evolution of 
civil society, and this development will result in a more prosperous environment”. 
Exploring the different perceptions, we come to the following definition:  
SSD is the ability of the community to develop the processes and structures necessary for its 
existence that support long-term relationships between nature and the economy. 
Determination of Text Corpus and Concepts in the SDS area 
There are numerous publications on the social sustainability. For the text corpus composition we have selected 
those of them who synthesize the concept most fully. Then, an exemplary text corpus is compiled including 
(Weingaertner, Moberg 2011), (Eizenberg, Jabareen 2017), (Rasouli, Kumarasuriyar 2016), and (Missimer, 
Robèrt, Broman 2017a, b). This corpus could be easily supplemented and changed. 
For the text corpus exploration the open-source language processing software toolkit GATE (Cunningham et 
al. 2018) is used. Two pipelines of GATE applications are composed – for each individual document and for 
corpus processing. A mixed approach is used. Firstly, the automatic text mining is carried out. Then, the final 
concept list is refined manually. The pipeline for document processing includes pre-processing (tokenization, 
sentence splitting, part-of-speech (POS) tagging), entity finding (gazetteer lookup, named entity tagging, etc.), 
co-reference (alias finding, orthographic co-reference, etc.) and result export. A screenshot of example annotation 
of an individual document is given on Figure 2. 
 
 
 
FIGURE 2. Annotation list of Social Sustainability in GATE (own source) 
The pipeline for text corpus processing includes comparative operations between its documents and result 
export in HTML lists. Then, name identification and co-referencing is implemented. The lists are filtered manually 
and most essential extracted words, phrases and abbreviations are marked and picked out in a common HTML 
list outside GATE. The key components are five: (1) equity & justice; (2) diversity social infrastructure; (3) social 
cohesion (interconnectedness); (4) quality of life and; (5) engaged governance. 
Finally, the extracted concept are compared with these of the Human Development Index (HDI) published 
annually for all countries in the world (Roser 2018). HDI highlights the main socio-economic and demographic 
factors and is one of the main tools in the international and regional statistical comparisons and is a summary 
measure of average achievement of three key dimensions of human development: 
x 
long and healthy life – measured by life expectancy; 
x 
access to education – measured by expected years of schooling of children at school-entry age and mean 
years of schooling of the adult population; 
110006-3

x 
a decent standard of living (basic indicators on the figure) – measured by gross national income (GNI) 
per capita. 
Obviously, there are many common concepts between HDI and SSD. Then, SSD encompasses notions of 
equity, empowerment, accessibility, participation, cultural identity and institutional stability (Daly 1992). The 
final concept list includes the most repeated concepts: social equity, livability, health equity, community 
development, social capital, social support, human rights, labor rights, placemaking, social responsibility, social 
justice, cultural competence, community resilience, and human adaptation.  
Controlled Vocabulary and Thesaurus Compilation 
By the standard ANSI/NISO Z39.19-2005 (2010), a controlled vocabulary is a list of terms that have been 
enumerated explicitly and supplemented with their definitions, synonyms, language and grammar qualifiers. 
Adding hierarchical and nonhierarchical relationships between terms, the controlled vocabulary turns into a 
thesaurus. The controlled vocabulary and the thesaurus in MS Access database are implemented. An example of 
the thesaurus on Figure 3 is given. 
 
 
FIGURE 3. Sustainable development thesaurus (own source) 
Each term is described by term indicator (TID), definition, syntactic category (part of speech), and relations 
with other terms. By ANSI/NISO Z39.19-2005, TID can be: top term (TT), preferred term (PT), related term (RT), 
narrower term (NT), non-preferred term (NPT), etc. 
The hierarchical relations determine the taxonomy. By Deliyska and Manoilov (2015), the taxonomy of classes 
could be divided into two main groups – classification (subsumption) and mereology. The classification includes 
terms linked with relations of type is-a/has-a.  
The native concepts of the OSSD mereology (direct subclasses of SSD) are: SSD metrics, SSD indicator and 
SSD goal. An excerpt of OSSD taxonomy on Figure 4 is given. 
SSD goal – an objective specification describing the endpoint of a development process following the 
Sustainable Development Agenda for 2030 (by the definition of the respective class in SDGIO). 
SSD indicator – a material entity which is composed of one or more parts of an environmental system, 
including its natural and anthropogenic socioeconomic components, which is thought to represent the state of the 
entire system (by the definition of the respective class in SDGIO).  
SSD metrics – set of ways how quantitative and qualitative indicators can measured. 
For its part, the OSSD classification scheme begins with Type of SSD node label. The node label is an ontology 
element that is not meant for indexing, but for organizing the hierarchy in the ontology classification 
(subsumption) structure. In this case, Type of SSD denotes the SSD classification helping the representation of the 
subsumption relations.  
The node Type of SSD has two sub-nodes of SSD classification – by the Target and by the Dimension. 
The sections of classification of Type of SSD by the Dimension are:  
Global SSD – the universal aspects of SSD, which are not influenced by civilizational, national or other 
features; 
110006-4

Regional SSD – outlines the features of SD, leaded by civilizational, socio-cultural, religious and other 
distinctions; 
National SSD – sets the national features in the goals, scope and criteria of the SSD; 
Organizational SSD – reveals the impact of the specifics of the mission, vision, goals and strategies of the 
social organization on SSD; 
Individual SSD – emphasizes the role of the active civil position of the individual in society as a crucial 
condition for achieving the goals, strategies and policies for SSD. 
 
 
FIGURE 4. Taxonomy of Social SD (own source) 
Another classification principle target (issue) is introduced, which along with the spatial specificity 
(dimension) gives the main areas in which the actions, goals and indicators measuring the social component of 
SD are focused. Main targets, shown on the figure above, are set for the Millennium Development Goals and 
represent basic elements of the taxonomy classification. 
These two classification principles give the main characteristics and highlight the main features of SD 
management activities in the social field. On the other hand, nonhierarchical relations exist of type association 
and equivalency (synonyms and near synonyms). For example, the SSD is associatively related to the concepts 
Sustainable Development of the Society and Social Sustainability and has near synonym Communal Sustainability.  
In common sense, a thesaurus is an ontology but it is not reusable in the Semantic Web. Then, an agreed 
ontology representation language is used. 
OSSD Formalization and External Ontologies Joining 
The Semantic Web standard languages for ontology building are RDF and OWL. They are embedded in the 
free, open-source Protégé development environment which is one of the leading ontology engineering tools. The 
thesaurus database OSSD is manually implemented using Protégé 5.5.0 version (Protégé, 2020). Currently, OSSD 
covers over 25 classes (concepts) with their annotations, instants (individuals), object properties and data 
properties. The external links with other ontologies in Ontology prefixes section of the Protégé main screen are 
manually established. Besides standard namespace prefixes (of XML(S), RDF(S), Dublin Core, etc.) placed 
automatically, the prefixes of external ontologies (according to 3.1) are added, namely: 
xmlns:osd="http://ontocom.net/downs/OntologySD.owl#" 
xmlns:os=" http://ontocom.net/downs/OntologySystem.owl#" 
xmlns:osde=" http://ontocom.net/downs/OSDE.owl#" 
110006-5

OSSD Reasoning, Verification and Querying 
Knowledge extraction from an ontology is a key problem in the Semantic Web. It is related to preliminary 
verification and reasoning of the respective ontology. In Protégé environment, these operations through Pelet or 
HermiT reasoners can be implemented. The reasoner checks the semantic structure and the mutual consistency of 
the ontological units and recognizes which concepts fit under which definitions. Moreover, the reasoner can 
examine the hierarchy correctness. OSSD preliminary verification and reasoning show the correct semantic 
structure and consistency. There are many ontology query languages but we claim that they are not suitable for 
non-expert users, unfamiliar with semantic technologies. The native formal languages in Protégé, generally 
intended for knowledge representation and querying, are Description Logics (DL) and SQWRL (Semantic Query-
Enhanced Web Rule Language). For example, SQWRL query for the asserted superclasses of class 
Social_Sustainable_Development_indicator looks as: 
owl:sca(Social_Sustainable_Development_indicator,?c) -> sqwrl:select(?c) ^ sqwrl:orderBy(?c) 
Other knowledge extraction queries about hierarchy, class instances, annotations, data/object properties, etc. 
can be composed and eventually saved in the ontology structure for future reuse.  
OSSD PUBLICATION AND DISTRIBUTION 
There are several universal open-source ontology repositories, as Ontobee library (Ong et al. 2017), Ontohub 
(Codescu et al. 2017), etc. An appropriate approach by publishing in a GitHub repository (Borydel/OSSD, 2020) 
is chosen because of its connection with previous repositories OSD and OSDE under the same GitHub project. 
Moreover, the future development of other ontologies in SD area follows. 
CONCLUSION 
The survey indicates a lack of theoretical and empirical studies regarding social sustainability. Then, OSSD is 
proposed as a part of the ontological metamodel of SD. The OSSD is developed with the aim of capturing and 
formalizing common reusable knowledge and general concepts in the SSD area. A methodology of OSSD building 
is proposed covering stages: main concept and ontology range definition; controlled vocabulary and thesaurus 
creating; ontology formalization; reasoning, verification and querying; publication and distribution. For the 
purpose, Semantic Web standard tools (OWL language and Protégé environment) were used. In that, the rules for 
ontology-based system and process modeling are followed. The abstract and OWL OSSD code are published in a 
GitHub repository.
