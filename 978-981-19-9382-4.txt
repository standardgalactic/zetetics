Dearly beloved friend of my youth, who could
climb to the top of the highest tree.

Preface
This book aims to contribute to the many and various endeavours currently striving
to understand and address the many ethical issues that surround AI. Since everyone
is impacted by the technologies in question, the book is thus directed to anyone with
any interest in the broad ﬁeld. The central aim is to contribute to our capacity to
understand, share, and debate ethical issues, to join in constructive dialogue with
others, and for each of us to consider our own use of such technologies. As much as
we need solutions to questions, we also need conversations that contribute to
advancing the depth and breadth of understanding, aiming for real-world effects
that help to improve how technology is designed and deployed. The book arises from
my work in the ﬁeld of AI, as well as many years of teaching philosophy and applied
ethics, of engaging with students in the classroom in discussion and debate.

About This Book
The ﬁeld of AI ethics is so broad that only a selection of issues can be covered. I aim
above all to demonstrate the particular contribution that the ﬁeld of ethics can make
to the necessarily interdisciplinary study of the challenges that the many facets of AI
present and to show the intimate connections between questions of applied ethics,
foundations of ethics, human nature, philosophy of technology, and conceptions of
intelligence, both artiﬁcial and natural. The book aims to introduce ideas and to show
their links, focusing upon enabling the reader to stretch their own capacity to look
into these questions, since it is of vital importance that we are all equipped as well as
possible to engage with these vital issues which are rapidly affecting so many parts
of our lives. Foundational issues in ethical theory and philosophy are introduced and
related to each other, with particular attention to methodological questions, and there
are many examples and cases. Later chapters focus more on particular applications
and ethical questions, ranging from questions facing us currently to imagined future
possibilities. There are multiple exercises and questions in each chapter, which can
be simply read through or engaged with more thoroughly. Each chapter also includes
notes for educators and further reading.

Chapter 1
Introduction: Why AI Ethics?
Abstract This chapter introduces the approach of the book towards the ethics of
artiﬁcial intelligence. A brief overview of artiﬁcial intelligence is given with an
outline of how heated debates about ethical issues can arise. Some different strate-
gies for addressing these issues are outlined. The mere imposition of regulations and
rules does not constitute a good approach to ethics, which should encompass many
considerations, including the best ways to live. Ethical discussions should embrace
contrasting voices, and we need to recognise that the very technologies in question
may shape how we think about ethics. AI raises a large variety of ethical questions
related to many factors, including the range of domains in which it is applied, the
speed of development, its embeddedness in much everyday technology, and the
ways in which it is acting to modify and transform the manner in which we interact
with each other and the world. AI ethics also requires us to think deeply about the
nature of ethics and about ourselves. The book will include considerations of
methodology in ethics, ethical theories and concepts, cases and exercises, and the
need for both bottom-up and top-down thinking.

Introduction
Summary
This chapter outlines the approach of this book. There is a pressing need for
contrasting voices to contribute to this ﬁeld and to recognise the complexity of the
ethics of AI, given that technology itself can inﬂuence how we think about and
approach questions of ethics.
This book aims to contribute to the many and various endeavours currently striving
to understand and to address the plethora of ethical issues that surround AI. Since
everyone is impacted in some way by the technologies in question, the book is thus
directed to anyone with any interest in the broad ﬁeld. The central aim is to
contribute to our capacity to understand, share, and debate ethical issues, to join in

constructive dialogue with others, and for each of us to consider our own use of such
technologies. As much as we need solutions to questions, we also need conversa-
tions that contribute to advancing the depth and breadth of understanding, aiming for
real-world effects that help to improve how technology is designed and deployed.

Introduction: Why AI Ethics?
My previous book in this ﬁeld concerned the development of codes of ethics and
regulations for AI [1]. People who speak to me thus often assume that I am a great
enthusiast for such codes and regulations. Indeed, they have an important place, but
there are many pitfalls, not least in that they may inadvertently contribute to a view
of ethics that it’s basically all about being told what to do by somebody else,
moreover, perhaps by somebody else who is sure what the right answer is, who
may not fully understand what they are talking about, and who probably has a dim
view of one’s capacity for ethical reﬂection and decent behaviour: an ‘external
authority’ view of ethics. This book emphasises the difﬁculties and uncertainties
of ethical reﬂection and the need for individuals and society as a whole to address the
many questions that AI presents. It does not seek simply to provide the correct
answers. Indeed, the very issues in AI that we need to discuss frequently help to
expose the limits and difﬁculties in our understanding of ethics.
There are a great many people from a range of backgrounds, varying in discipline
and expertise, and with a large variety of approaches and opinions, all contributing
towards these endeavours. It is essential that as many as possible are involved in
such discussions and that there should be dialogue between different approaches,
and doubtless the case that differences of opinion, some major, some minor, will
always remain.
This ﬁrst chapter provides a basic overview of the strategies of this book and of
the approach taken to understanding and asking questions in ethics. As with all the
chapters, there are occasional exercises and questions for the reader. These can be
either skimmed over, done as you read, or returned to later, as you wish; they can all
be done by individuals, but many lend themselves to working in groups.
Like all the chapters, this is laid out with plenty of headings and subsections
clearly marked, so that readers with different levels of time and interest can skim
through if need be, or read more fully. Further reading is given at the end of each
chapter, in addition to a reference list of works cited throughout the text.

What Is Artiﬁcial Intelligence?
Summary
This section presents an overview of ways in which artiﬁcial intelligence is under-
stood as an engineering technology and also as a scientiﬁc discipline. Different
underlying attitudes to understanding what AI is will inﬂuence approaches to ethical
questions.

1.2
What Is Artiﬁcial Intelligence?
3
One of the ﬁrst questions is what precisely we mean by ‘artiﬁcial intelligence’, since
this will affect what ethical questions arise and how we look at them. This question is
somewhat complex, since there are different accounts of AI, including disputes
about whether speciﬁc instances of technology are ‘truly’ AI and disputes about
what the aims and ambitions of AI should or should not be. Part of the difﬁculty
stems from unanswered questions about the nature of intelligence, a topic to which
we return in Chap. 6. Sources and further reading are given at the end of this chapter.
Artiﬁcial intelligence may be understood as a technology in terms of the engi-
neering capacities required for certain tasks and also in terms of a scientiﬁc discipline
[2]. For our purposes, it is also interesting to note that some accounts speciﬁcally
refer to human intelligence, while others do not. We can understand AI broadly as
concerning the capacities of computers, including hardware devices controlled by
computers, to reproduce elements of intelligent thought and behaviour, sometimes
expressed in terms such as the capacity to perform tasks that require intelligence if
performed by a human being. We can also broadly think of AI as the diverse set of
technologies that extend not just our capacities to act in the world but also our
powers of thought and decision-making. AI may refer to the software involved or to
the various hardware devices in which it is embedded, such as autonomous cars or
robots. AI is often embedded as a component in a larger system.
The scientiﬁc discipline of AI includes branches examining planning and knowl-
edge representation, machine learning, decision-making, and robotics. Components
of intelligence that have been the focus of work on AI include machine learning,
since any intelligent creature must be capable of learning; perception of the envi-
ronment, including perception of the effects of an AI’s own actions, since under-
standing of the environment is essential for any intelligent action and agency;
natural language processing, since communication via language is such a critical
part of human intelligence and is needed for many tasks; reasoning, for instance, the
ability to apply the rules of logic and mathematics and to draw conclusions from
evidence and experience; and problem solving, such as the capacity to work out how
to solve puzzles and achieve tasks given certain parameters and resources. If AI is to
achieve action in the world, it will need appropriate actuators, which could be
physical or in the form of software.
What does the claim that AI is possible amount to? There are different ways of
understanding this assertion. Mike Wooldridge expresses it in terms of whether we
can develop machines that exhibit intelligent behaviour by following sets of rules
[3]. The rules may be deductive in form, which basically means that starting from
true premises and following certain rules, the conclusions drawn can be certain to be
true. Alternatively, they may be inductive, based upon generalisations from data,
which can be more or less accurate. Strategies to achieve AI may involve modelling
the mind, and some focus on modelling the brain.
Some useful terms include the following:
Weak AI: the attempt to build programmes that demonstrate capabilities of intelli-
gence, without necessarily being ‘intelligent’ themselves.

Strong AI: the attempt to build programmes that have intelligence in the form of
4

understanding and/or that are conscious.
Artiﬁcial General Intelligence (AGI): the attempt to build programmes that demon-
strate the full range of intelligence capabilities exhibited by human beings.
Superintelligence: a notion of artiﬁcial intelligence that vastly exceeds human
intelligence and hence may be hard or impossible for us to understand.
Superintelligent AI is presumed capable of recursive self-improvement and of
the creation of technologies of greater and greater intelligence.
There are different attitudes towards the goals of AI. Some focus on achieving
speciﬁc tasks involving components of intelligence. Others see AI as a larger project
to reproduce human-level intelligence, or general intelligence, in machines. Closely
related are the projects of attempting to understand human intelligence further by
examining the realisation of intelligence within machines, an activity closely related
to cognitive science.
It will often be acutely relevant to ethical questions to consider how precisely an
instance of AI functions, and it’s also often important to consider how we concep-
tualise AI, what we imagine it to be.
For example, machine learning (ML) involves the use of large amounts of data
and of statistical techniques. Many ethical questions can hence arise, even if we
consider simply ethical issues concerning the collection and use of data. There are
also many speciﬁc questions that arise from the nature of this technology, as we shall
see, such as questions about how ML produces its outputs from the data, the ‘black
box’ issue, or the question of transparency. In contrast, if we consider the project of
AI as the attempt to fully reproduce or even exceed human intelligence, we should
immediately see that questions of a rather different type may arise. This helps
explain why there are many who wish to deny that some particular project to use
ML to solve some speciﬁc and well-deﬁned problem is ‘truly’ artiﬁcial intelligence.
This book will take a broad deﬁnition of AI, noting that ethical questions arise
from different aspects of how AI operates, where it operates, and from features of the
technologies and hardware devices within which it is embedded and their
deployment.
One of the reasons for having a broad approach to the deﬁnition of AI is this:
Attention to potential problems of AI has alerted us to certain issues that seem to
arise from the power, capabilities, and reach of AI. However, in some cases, further
examination may reveal that the issues raised are also present and were prefaced in
less sophisticated technologies, for example, in computing power, which generally
does not merit the label of ‘artiﬁcial intelligence’.
Fear, dread, and optimism abound in AI There is a great deal of discussion and
effort being made to guard against potential negative impacts of AI and, more
positively, to try to ensure that AI, conceived broadly, is used productively and in
ways that genuinely create value for humanity. Indeed, high hopes on the one hand
and fear and dread on the other are characteristic of the narratives and debates around
AI and technology in general, not just in popular media but also to be found within
academic and technical literature. A quick browse of news sites reveals hopes that AI

will help to save the bee population, cure cancer, curb drownings, solve problems
that governments have in dealing with data, design enzymes to digest plastic waste,
end the global food shortage, solve insomnia without drugs, cure glaucoma, and
solve the climate crisis. Conversely, a search for fears about AI will reveal a claim
that an AI-powered microwave oven tried to cook a man to death, that skilled
workers will lose jobs because of AI, that certain apps are complex scams, that the
global supply chain is at risk of hackers, that the world faces a global war with robot
tanks and AI weapons, and that AI-powered tech is worsening racism, will end
privacy as we know it, and is generally getting ‘scarier and scarier’. Both what is
feared and what is hoped for are often presented as novel and as all encompassing.
One of the questions we will look at is why this might be the case.
1.3
And What, Precisely, Is Ethics?
5
As a short trailer for some things to come, consider how such fears and hopes are
expressed and what precisely they concern. There are different ways of expressing
such hopes and fears. Should we be concerned with the impacts of AI on humanity;
should our concern be with living things in general; should we be concerned with the
planet as a whole; or should we be concerned with conscious beings, regardless of
biology? As soon as we start to think about some of the potentials of AI, someone
will start asking questions about the boundaries between humans and complex
machines, and questions of ethics inevitably arise.
One of the important questions is indeed how to deﬁne and approach these
questions of value. What does ‘AI ethics’ cover, and what else do we need? It is
indeed a central premise of my approach that although ethics does have a great deal
to offer, debates and discussions in ethics are often limited. Therefore, while here we
focus on ethics, the book endeavours to indicate where additional insights and
approaches are needed. Some of these are complementary, but some may even be
in opposition to the endeavour that has come to be known as ‘AI ethics’.
1.3
And What, Precisely, Is Ethics?
Summary
There is an approximate shared understanding of the term ‘ethics’, which may mask
a number of serious disagreements about what it is and what it might promise to
deliver.
For now, you’ll all have a rough idea of what is meant by questions of ethics around
AI to get the gist of the issues, but nonetheless, there is plenty to be learned from
diving deeper into this question, as we shall also do. To clarify matters, the terms
‘ethics’ and ‘morality’ are sometimes used to mean slightly different things, but there
is no consistency of usage, and here, ‘ethics’ and ‘morality’ will be used inter-
changeably. Questions of ethics concern issues we think of as being especially
important in a weighty kind of way. These are often things that affect individuals
very deeply and/or things that affect society in general. Because of this, it is
important to obtain understanding and agreement. However, questions of value are

precisely also those questions where there is often profound disagreement, including
disagreement about how to approach these questions.

Introduction: Why AI Ethics?
Strategies for approaching AI ethics There are various approaches to the hopes
and fears elicited by AI. These range from regulations, law, codes of conduct,
attempts to design AI with safety and ethics uppermost, attempts to build ethics
into design process, speciﬁc strategies such as attempts to understand and mitigate
bias, and so on. Some focus on current issues; some focus on longer-term and more
speculative questions, such as possible dangers of superintelligence. Some issues are
concrete and speciﬁc; some are more general, wide-ranging, or foundational. Some
approaches lean towards the view that AI presents a threat that we might lose control
of ourselves and of our values and that we need radical shifts to deal with the world
that is coming. Other approaches are more sanguine and diligently tread the path of
trying to ensure that the technologies that are being developed and used ﬁt within
current frameworks of value in approaches broadly labelled ‘value alignment’.
Here is a strategy and hope of this book To provide a way of introducing these
issues that will help readers to deepen their understanding of the depth and com-
plexity of the issues, their appreciation of different viewpoints, and their appreciation
of how ethical questions intersect with many other ﬁelds of inquiry. The emphasis is
not on learning facts about debates and views in AI ethics but on developing the
capacity to think, argue, and question. Thinking through questions ‘for yourself’
does not mean ‘by yourself’. Community with others is incredibly useful in this
endeavour, and we can connect with these others in a variety of ways, whether by
reading the words of long-dead thinkers or by chatting to the person who happens to
sit next to you in class.
The need for contrasting views I spoke of ‘contrasting’ views, not of ‘opposing’
views, because the need to maintain debate on all aspects of a question in this area is
vital. Of course, on some issues, deeply held opinions may be completely at odds.
However, much can still be learned from ﬁnding out why someone holds their
views—if, indeed, they are able to articulate this. People often hold views we
consider wrong for interesting reasons from which we can learn much. Moreover,
many issues in ethics are not clear-cut. Even if one is convinced that a particular
solution to a problem is the best, it is often possible to see drawbacks and often
possible to understand how those with a different perspective might beg to differ.
Dominant voices in the here and now There are good reasons for taking such a
strategy in any area, but here there is a particular reason to approach the matter with
an open mind. Concerns are frequently expressed that the dominance of certain
voices and interests in the tech ﬁeld provide a good reason for concern about the
values being imposed in the world via technology produced by a small number of
powerful individuals and corporations. However, there is a similar danger within the
frameworks and discussions of the ethics of AI. These, too, may be dominated by
certain voices. This needs to be addressed.

1.3
And What, Precisely, Is Ethics?
7
There is a particular reason to think reﬂectively about debates in ethics in relation
to these new technologies. It is easy to assume that because we are making great
strides in technology, we have also made great strides in ethics, such that we have an
ethic sufﬁciently robust to deal with the technology at hand. Another way of putting
this is that it is common to sense an assumption that ethical thought has progressed
so that ‘now’ ‘we’ have it right. There is a signiﬁcant danger that we will look at
these issues only from the point of view of the voices shouting the loudest in the
early part of the twenty-ﬁrst century from the most visible parts of the world.
Technologies may inﬂuence how we think about ethics If by some magic ﬂuke,
‘we’ now have a ‘perfect’ ethics, whatever that means, then there is no harm in
keeping an open mind, and we might ﬁne-tune and fast track any progress. If not,
then it is essential that we equip people who are going to be developing, deploying,
selling, buying, and using this technology to think in the widest possible way about
how it impacts value. And, let’s face it, it is unlikely our ethics is perfect. Moreover,
there are many reasons to consider that, as we develop and deploy technology, the
way we think about questions of value in relation to it may well change. We return to
this theme at various points throughout the book. For now, consider the technologies
in which AI is embedded through which we get so much of our information and
connection to the world and to others. We already know much about the pressures
within social media both for groupthink and for extremely oppositional attacks on
those with differing views, although how precisely this happens and its extent are
under examination and dispute. So this alone should tell us that perhaps some of the
very technologies we are addressing are helping to shape the world we see, how we
judge it, and how we interact with each other. Our progress in technology can make
us arrogant; the rapid change of views on some ethical issues seen in some parts of
the world in recent times may lead us to think that now ‘we’ have ﬁnally got things
right, but at the same time, our increasingly global connections fostered and
extended by such technologies should also make us all the more aware of other
voices.
This illustrates in an introductory way the intimate links between how we are
thinking and feeling about ethical questions in AI and the large range of technologies
that use it. Even the fact that we are surrounded by continual advertising for upgrades
to technology creates a certain impression of progress. Think too of how common
and easy it is casually to think of the human mind as if it is a kind of computer,
perhaps not a very good computer that needs help from a machine. Does our
fascination with this world of technology help to shape how we see humans?

Meanwhile, stop to jot down any thoughts you have about how you formed your
views on AI and what fears and hopes you may have for it. There are no wrong
answers. Spend as much or as little time as you like. (Feel free to skip any exercises,

Introduction: Why AI Ethics?
1.4
What Does This Book Cover?
Summary
The book will examine both concrete issues and speciﬁc cases, general themes and
concepts and ethical theories that emerge, and critically consider the methodologies
used to address ethical questions. Artiﬁcial intelligence is forcing us to think deeply
about many basic concepts in ethics.
Concrete questions This book will examine a selection of tangible issues and
speciﬁc cases from within the broad ﬁeld of AI ethics. There are so many that it’s
only possible to include a few of the very many possible. However, it is hoped that
you will be able to apply what you’ve learned to issues representing your own
personal interests and areas of expertise and greatest concern. The issues we need to
discuss encompass a wide range of domains and possibilities—from the far future,
the immediate present, or the near future, and from disparate types of technology,
used for different reasons, in diverse domains, such as in policework to healthcare to
social connections. From brain implants designed to make us smart to persuasive
technology seemingly designed to make us dumb. From superintelligence that
threatens to rule over us to surveillance that helps those with technological capacity
to inﬂuence populations. There will be questions about who is using the technology,
whether individuals, governments, or corporations. In addition, questions about how
individuals respond to the design of technology, how free we are with respect to the
many technologies into which AI is embedded.
General themes emerge Looking at concrete issues and comparing and contrasting
the issues they raise will bring forth general themes, such as freedom, power, and
control, questions on the theme of human nature, and questions about meaning.
When I ﬁrst started as an undergraduate studying philosophy in the 1970s, I
distinctly recall one of my tutors scofﬁng out loud at the suggestion that philosophy
might deal with questions such as ‘the meaning of life’. However, it is difﬁcult to
address many of the most central questions in AI ethics without addressing questions
such as whether or not a life where machines have taken over all work, or replaced
human companionship, is a life with meaning and value. Some approaches to
artiﬁcial intelligence have indeed endeavoured to use it to further our understanding
of ourselves. Some consider that the very project of artiﬁcial intelligence is one stage
in the progress of unfolding value in the universe, one in which humans have a
particular role and destiny.
Theories and concepts The frameworks behind questions: Thus, concrete ques-
tions give rise to more general, far-reaching considerations. The book aims to
unpack these and to look closely at the underlying ethical concepts and methodol-
ogies. We will also consider how well existing ethical theories and frameworks serve
the ﬁeld of AI ethics. We need to think seriously about the practice of ethics and
carefully critique how it should be applied in the case of AI. As well as a critical
approach to ethics, we should note again and again that the perspective of other
disciplines and expertise is essential. Ethics intersects with, and is inﬂuenced by,

history, culture, religion, and much more. Although this book focuses on ethics, it
also includes an introduction to other realms of thinking we need to consider, both
within philosophy and outside. Naturally, this can only be in outline, but with the
aim of alerting readers to questions in AI ethics where the ‘ethics’ part, per se, might
need the help of a challenging friend.
1.5

Methodologies All the above means we are required to think about how precisely
to approach ethical questions in AI. There are many in this domain who are already
critically questioning the place of ‘ethics’ as a discipline and as an approach. To
some extent, this represents the ongoing sibling rivalry of different academic
disciplines, inevitable perhaps when one discipline feels that another is criticising
it and when disciplines have very different methodologies. It is also sometimes the
case that work in ethics comments on things it has not fully understood, and
sometimes fails to see the signiﬁcance of ideas which are of central concern for
other disciplines. Moreover, within ethics, there are signiﬁcant differences between
the methodological approaches of different theories. Such differences, as we shall
see, have a profound impact on how the ethical questions of AI are understood and
on what answers are given. This book stresses the importance of considering the
methodologies used to think about the ethics of AI and thus hopes to be more like a
tool kit for assisting with your exploration of these questions, rather than a ‘how to’
instruction manual.
Artiﬁcial intelligence is making useful trouble for ethics One of the features of
AI ethics is how forcefully it reveals the necessity of examining our theories, our
concepts, and our methodologies. A frequently expressed fear that AI may ‘take
over’ human agency, that it may be used by governments and corporations to intrude
upon our lives and control us, or even that AI itself may develop to a level where it
treats us like farmed animals rather than like the human beings we strive to
be. However, what makes me more optimistic is precisely the way in which, by
raising such complex and difﬁcult ethical questions, artiﬁcial intelligence is pushing
us to ask and address profound questions about ethics, about human life, agency, and
our place in this world. In this way, far from dehumanising us, it could rehumanise
us. It’s truly very exciting.
1.5
Why AI Ethics Is So Exciting
Summary
I think AI ethics is the most exciting branch of applied ethics I’ve ever worked
in. However, a warning is given about hype both in AI and in AI ethics. AI is used in
a large variety of different domains, hence presenting many diverse ethical ques-
tions. The technologies are being rapidly developed and rolled out. AI is helping to
modify how we relate to the world and to each other.

Introduction: Why AI Ethics?
Exercise 2
If you ﬁnd the prospect of studying the ethics of AI intriguing, jot down what issues
you’ve ﬁnd most fascinating, and why. What unanswered questions do you have?
Do you have any ﬁrm opinions, or do you feel more uncertain and torn? If you are
reading this book only because you are obliged to as part of course fulﬁlments, you
may ﬁnd the prospect of ethics a chore. I sympathise. There is enough poor work that
passes for ethics that I ﬁnd it hard to blame you. Write down any misgivings and I
hope that at least some of them will be addressed throughout the book.
However, ﬁrst, a reminder about hype There can be hype in accounts of the
capabilities of AI, and of its future promise, and likewise there can be hype in the
prognostications of doom or glory surrounding AI. There can also be hype around AI
ethics. Note that although many working in ethics warn against how AI is
presented—the frequent photos of killer robots accompanying what turn out to be
mundane news reports about tech, for example—ethics as a ﬁeld also has something
to gain from sensationalising the problems AI might bring. It keeps us in a job.
However, there are genuine grounds for concern and genuine reasons for excitement
about the ﬁeld.
Exercise 3
The next time you read a news report or tech blog, etc., regarding AI, think carefully
about how any harmful or beneﬁcial aspects of it are being presented, if they are
being sensationalised, and consider how that might impact ethical responses.
Remember that sometimes, people sensationalise or exaggerate for good reasons if
they are trying to warn or to attract attention when no one is listening.
Over the years, I have researched and taught in many areas of applied ethics: in
medical ethics, healthcare ethics more broadly, in ethical and social issues in
genetics and genomics, engineering ethics, and environmental ethics. However, of
all these, the area of AI ethics is the most challenging and the most exciting. Why?
For a number of different reasons.
Ubiquity and reach There is one simple reason—AI gets everywhere. It has so
many diverse applications that an ethics of AI is, in a way, an ‘ethics of everything’.
Medical ethics deals with medical care: it then must bring in a wider range of
considerations, such as balancing medical interests with other interests, and it
draws upon general questions, such as the value of human life. However, it is a
relatively conﬁned domain. It has its own characteristic concerns, such as questions
about informed consent in the context of medicine, the relevance of the distinction
between health and illness and how precisely this is drawn, the particular profes-
sional expectations on doctors, and so on. Likewise with all the other ‘ethics of’
ﬁelds. However, AI can be applied in any domain. Therefore, along with considering
AI per se, one will ﬁnd oneself looking across a great range of domains of life. With
each one, there will be a speciﬁc context to examine as well as the more general
issues pertaining to AI.

1.5
Why AI Ethics Is So Exciting
11
A plethora of diverse issues As has been touched on above, AI covers different
approaches and methods in science and in engineering, each of which potentially
gives rise to ethical questions. AI may refer to more than discrete tasks of computing
but may also be conceived as a larger project with variously described ambitions in
relation to intelligence and, moreover, sometimes with explicit reference to human
intelligence and consciousness. Hence, the range of potential ethical issues that arise
can even be bewildering. Moreover, as we shall see, it is very often the case that
when we consider AI, questions are raised that force us to ask deeper questions about
some of the central and foundational assumptions and concepts in certain areas of
ethics.
Exercise 4
Thinking of as many speciﬁc instances of AI that you can, quickly try to draw up the
longest list you can of areas where AI is being implemented, or looks set to be
implemented soon. Think about what areas you have any particular knowledge about
and other areas where you know less.
Speed AI technologies are developing rapidly, albeit, we do have to watch out for
some hype about how fast development is happening, with a tendency to premature
claims of readiness. However, there have certainly been rapid changes to a broad
range of areas of life as AI is developed and implemented. This can make it both
exciting and extremely difﬁcult to keep up with what is happening, let alone to
consider the ethical, social, and cultural implications of these changes. This is
especially true given the great diversity of applications. A change can hit you in
the face before you even know it’s coming. Indeed, you might quickly forget that
something is new, and ways we used to do things might have completely faded from
memory.
Exercise 5
Consider some of the technology that you now take for granted that uses AI. Now
cast your mind back to a time before you used it. Sometimes it is almost comical to
recall life without a certain bit of tech, even though it’s truly pretty recent in origin.
AI is embedded Sometimes we are clearly and consciously aware that AI is being
used, but often we are not. Either because we hadn’t ever thought of or known about
its presence, or because we just got used to it, like the squeaky gate or living under
the ﬂightpath to an airport. Again, this is compounded by the wide range of
applications of AI, but it’s more than that: it’s that AI has become integrated into
our world, and often in ways that impact upon, or are even transformative of, key
aspects of our lives. This will likewise present challenges in working out what
impact AI is actually having, let alone in considering its virtues and vices, the pluses
and minuses of AI. Nobody fully understands the impact AI is having, or might
have, even within certain discrete areas, let alone in general.
This is one of the reasons why the approach to the question of ‘what precisely
is AI?’ is taken rather broadly in this book because so many of the technologies
which make use of AI, in whatever form, are linking together and interacting in a

manner which is making often profound, sometimes mundane, changes to our world.
The context of AI thus is not simply its domain of use—say, medicine, the law, and
communication; the context of AI is also other AI.
12

Introduction: Why AI Ethics?
Transformations central to our ways of being in the world Technologies involv-
ing AI are impacting so many of the ways in which we interact with the world and
the avenues from which we shape our values. This forces us to think about the
questions of value in very thorough ways—or if we don’t, our answers will be
superﬁcial. These include but are not limited to changes in how we think and
communicate; impacts on how we see and interact with others, with society in
general, with the world, and with ourselves; and impacts upon how we access and
relate to knowledge, both more intimate personal knowledge and scientiﬁc or factual
knowledge. So we are on a moving train, or rather, because trains run on tracks, a
moving vehicle, or we are even perhaps trying to ride on the back of a dragon. We
are trying to think about something which may be changing how we think of it as we
do so. This is more challenging than simply dealing with something that is new and
that is rapidly developing.
Some of the questions in AI ethics are relatively ﬁne-tuned and relatively well-
deﬁned. For example, there are critically important questions about safety and
accuracy, such as the question of whether using AI to assist the interpretation of
medical images is more reliable than using humans alone. Indeed, one might not
even think of these as ethical questions per se. I was recently struck by listening to a
retired engineer lamenting the introduction of ethics guidance into his profession
many years ago, which had struck him as an insult to him and his profession, given
that the ethics codes seemed to assume that engineers would not otherwise be
concerned with safety; it was a paramount concern.
However, many aspects of even these discrete questions strike at the heart of
questions of ethics, value, and meaning. If large-scale technological unemployment
follows from automation via AI, with what do we ﬁll our lives? The very project
of using machines to replace human thought and decision-making raises the question
of why do anything at all, if a machine can do it instead. Are we, humans, at the heart
of value? Or are we dispensable? The project of AI, if conceived in one way as
attempting to replicate our intelligence, raises the question of who we are, and from
this arises an entire gamut of questions about human nature. But wait, it goes even
further. The metaverse raises questions about what reality is and why reality matters,
if indeed it does. Perhaps we should abandon the whole concept of ‘reality’, and
focus only on what is most immediate to us, focus on our feelings. It can sometimes
seem like everything we knew, everything we placed our foundations on, is up for
grabs.
Indeed, one reason for the fears, hopes, and polarisation so often found in this
ﬁeld is surely linked to the way that AI presents us with such profound questions, not
just about the use of technology and its beneﬁts or harms, but about our values, and
about us.

Why Should Anyone Want to Study AI Ethics?
Summary
This section looks at some reasons why many are cynical or sceptical about AI
ethics. These include seeing ethics as the imposition of rules by others, or as little but
prohibitions, and sceptical questions about the need for morality. Alternative views
see ethics as concerned with living one’s best life and as an essential part of the good
design of technology.
What’s in it for you to study AI ethics? There will be a variety of different answers to
this question. ‘Ethics’ is such a familiar term but can be understood in many and
often opposing ways. So before we begin, it will be useful to take an overview of
some of these different approaches to ethics and some motivations for reading this
book. In other words, to raise questions about why anyone would be concerned
about ethics. Or the classic question of so many philosophy tutorials, ‘Why should I
be moral?’
Exercise 6
Before we start, jot down in a couple of minutes (a) a quick deﬁnition of ‘ethics’;
(b) a short account of why you are reading this book; and (c) what you hope to get
out of the book. Again, there are no wrong answers.
Some readers will start with an interest in ethics, wishing to understand how it
applies to the case of AI. For these, we have already discussed how AI presents
numerous fascinating challenges for ethics. However, this book is also for people
who are being forced to take a course on AI ethics as part of their studies. Some very
reluctantly and only to get credit, some with more enthusiasm. (In my experience,
enthusiasm for ethics courses is often based on the presupposition that it will be easy.
We’ll see about that.) Likewise, ethics, especially in relation to some professional
activity, is often regarded as something you have to know about to qualify and to
practice, sometimes to gain admission to a professional body. This may then
encourage the view that ethics is about knowing enough to gain a qualiﬁcation,
satisfy your line manager, and avoid being sued. I have in fact taught on courses like
this, and you can probably guess, that as a philosopher, I think there is more to ethics.
However, I do understand why it can easily seem as if ‘ethics’ is a tiresome
bureaucratic requirement.
Some of the reasons for this view of ethics stem from certain conceptions of what
ethics is. Ethics may be seen as something that some external authority tells you that
you must do, often as a list of rules for compliance, or else. Indeed, ethics is often
presented in such a way. This understandably often gives rise to resentment, and one
of the reasons for such resentment can stem from an opposing view of ethics—that it
is something merely personal, that we each have a subjective value system which
may be at odds with what is expected of us by external authorities, yet but to which
we are nonetheless entitled.
Take note of these opposing elements, the external locus and the internal locus of
ethics, contrasts between what we may perhaps call the objective and the subjective.

We are gesturing here at some of the difﬁculties of ethics and some of the reasons for
very different responses and approaches. This is just a very introductory way of
indicating large currents in thousands of years of history of thinking about ethics.
Ethics seems ‘subjective’ and personal for so many reasons; it demands things of me,
it seems so closely connected to my feelings and emotions, and it’s so obvious that
there is some variation in ethical views. However, ethics also seems to have weight,
authority, and a certain profound relevance for the well-being and interests of myself
and of others that suggests a certain objectivity; moreover, some basic elements of
ethics, such as rules concerning killing or harming human beings, appear to be very
widespread in different cultures. Both elements seem essential to explaining why
ethics matters. Both ways of looking at ethics have their attractions and dangers.
Considering this delicate balancing act is a useful way of helping to understand some
of the difﬁcult and fascinating questions that will arise later, questions that AI is
helping to highlight.

Introduction: Why AI Ethics?
Ethics as ‘thou shalt not’ Another common and understandable source of wariness
about ethics is the assumption that it is mostly concerned with telling people what
not to do, with negative instructions, often with heavy sanctions and threats of
punishment. A vision of a punitive authority, a scary judge, or some angry God
laying down commandments that try to enforce unliveable demands on human
beings, usually in the form of absolute rules, unfortunately reﬂects the experience
of some people. This is regrettable, and accounts of ethics can be far richer, positive,
and humane. Not all accounts of ethics focus on rules, and even those that do may
strive to take into account nuance and context. Some accounts will include permis-
sive rules as well as prohibitions. Some accounts hold up standards to strive towards,
which we may be unlikely to reach in full, but which we can aim towards with more
or less success. These stand in contrast to stark visions of failing to comply with
absolute rules. (On the other hand, murder of the innocent is just wrong.)
Ethics as ‘ﬁnding fault’ In the context of ethical questions about technologies, it is
especially important to stress that ethics should be more than prohibitions. Because
ethical concerns often focus on warnings and dangers, it is easy to gain the impres-
sion that AI ethics is simply about attempting to prevent disasters or poor outcomes.
This then may give the impression that those concerned with AI ethics have a basic
stance of wariness or even opposition to technology. However, it would not be
ethical to prevent the development of good technology. However, in an area where
progress is, or seems to be, rapid, loud warning shouts may seem more common than
praise, for reasons of caution. Some caution may be justiﬁed, especially where
technologies may quickly become so embedded in our lives and in the infrastructure
that by the time we realise that there are major downsides, it’s difﬁcult or practically
impossible to extricate ourselves.

1.6
Why Should Anyone Want to Study AI Ethics?

Perfect and Imperfect Duties
A distinction between perfect and imperfect duties has been made by some
philosophers and can be useful for explaining differences in moral
requirements.
A perfect duty is binding at all times; in other words, there is no choice
about when or how to follow it—you just must obey. For this reason, perfect
duties tend to be expressed in the negative. Because quite simply, it’s usually
easy to not steal, to not lie, to not murder, every second of the day, yet almost
impossible to ‘be kind’, ‘be generous’, ‘save lives’, etc., without ceasing.
In contrast, an imperfect duty is one where an individual has a general duty
to perform certain actions, but has choice about the manner and timing of these
actions. For example, rendering aid to others is a duty without which society
would be very poor indeed, but there is no necessity to spend every waking
minute fulﬁlling this duty. Indeed, were one to do so, it would be impossible to
fulﬁl other duties.
A supererogatory action is a good action which is over and above one’s
required duties. For example, one might be required to render aid to rescue a
person if this did not involve immediately endangering one’s own life, so a
person who risked or lost his or her own life to save another could be said to
have performed an act of supererogation in going beyond the call of duty.
Closely related to these considerations is the question ‘why should I be moral?’,
and indeed, different conceptions of ethics give rise to divergent answers to this
question. One answer is simply, ‘so that I don’t get into trouble’, which is at least a
start, although it has the well-known problem that if a person thinks they can get
away with something, in the absence of any countering considerations, they are
likely to go ahead and do it.
The Ring of Gyges: An Ancient ‘Cloak of Invisibility’
Many of the central questions of ethics have perplexed people for centuries. In
his work, the Republic, Plato discusses the problem of the Ring of Gyges and
what this means for the question, ‘why should I be moral?’ [4].
In Greek myth, and in the version told in the Republic by the character
Glaucon, Gyges was a shepherd who found a golden ring with magic powers.
When he twisted on his ﬁnger, he became invisible. However, rather than
going around performing good deeds anonymously, he arranged to be sent to
report to the king. Once at the palace, he seduced the queen (one can only
speculate at how she might have reacted to being seduced by someone
invisible), murdered the king, and seized the throne.
Some work in psychology backs up the idea that if we are being watched by
others, we are less likely to behave wrongly. Studies in social psychology have
found that a sense of anonymity can encourage poor behaviour [5, p. 289 ff].

16

Introduction: Why AI Ethics?
Exercise 7
The Ring of Gyges is relevant for today in numerous ways. Even though the
Republic was written in approximately 375 BC, the question of how we could
behave under conditions of anonymity is central to how people behave (often very
badly) online. Note how modern technology facilitates two opposing phenomena:
the ability to remain anonymous and unseen and, in contrast, the ever-present eyes
and ears of often unknown others. Why is it that a person might behave differently if
nobody knows who they are? Will their behaviour always tend to be worse? Think
about the reasons behind your answer. Conversely, in this age of almost continual
surveillance, how might behaviour change as a result? This is a complex question to
answer, and it will be far from simple that social pressure of observation will result in
net beneﬁts for society.
Scepticism about ethics In answering the question of why I should care about
morality, a sceptical response is very common, especially perhaps among those who
are trained in scientiﬁc methods and in critical thinking [6]. Indeed, it’s a perfectly
valid response, given that what is at stake is important, and given the obvious
disputes within ethics and difﬁculties of supplying a universally accepted answer.
It’s a response that may also naturally ﬁt with a view of ethics as a set of require-
ments on people to do things they might otherwise not want to do, for the sake of
others, and/or on the say-so of some distant authority. Naturally, we are somewhat
sceptical about such demands.
A sceptical response to the question of ‘why should I be moral’ is also found in
those who adhere to the philosophical doctrine of egoism. An egoist considers that
all motivation ultimately refers to the self—each person has to have their own reason
to act morally. However, here AI ethics has something of an answer, because it’s
essential that in considering AI, we have to consider the human person, in other
words, ourselves. Quite simply, if AI is replacing, supplementing, and improving
human thought and agency, then this raises questions of how we compare AI with
humans—so we have to examine humans and how and why we value them. We
might even ﬁnd something wanting in the conception of the self upon which such
philosophical egoism depends.
So we have to study humans ourselves. What could be more fascinating? For the
egoist who raises sceptical questions about what is in it for him or her to examine
ethical questions, here is your answer—you will be examining yourself.
My best life There are other approaches to ethics which might more naturally
address such sceptical responses. Ethics can be thought of as about living the best
life possible, which, since we are social animals, will have implications for how we
treat others. A prominent example is the work of Aristotle, who was one of Plato’s
pupils. His approach to ethics is extremely inﬂuential today for those who advocate
‘virtue ethics’, which we will consider in greater detail later. In his work, The
Nicomachean Ethics, he sets out to address how we should live ‘the good life for
man’ (and yes, unfortunately, in common with virtually all his contemporaries, he
did give men a higher status than women) [7]. His answer included the conclusion

that the life of virtue was the best way to achieve happiness. Of course, there is much
to be said about his views, but rather than presenting ethics as something likely to be
at odds with a person’s own best interest, this approach to ethics does the reverse,
although naturally, some argue that Aristotle did not succeed in this particular quest.
1.7
Bottom-Up and Top-Down Approaches to AI Ethics
17
Ethics as design Furthermore, if we see ethics as part and parcel of design, of
producing and deploying products with genuine value, we can also see studying
ethics as something to be integrated with studying AI, computing, and technology,
not some separate afterthought to design. Again, one could understand the necessity
of ethics in design as something the market, the customer, wants, or as something
integral to the aims of the designer. We can also see these design questions as being
about how technologies are used. Since you are inevitably a user of technologies,
there are value choices facing you about how you respond to and interact with
technologies.
The inevitability of ethics Last, at the start of a term’s tutorials on ethics, students
often begin by asking me these questions: ‘Why should I be moral? Why should I
think about ethics?’ I explain to them that they have walked into a trap. As soon as
you have asked these questions, you have either to answer it or to pretend you don’t
know there are questions there demanding your attention. Either way, there will be
some ways in which, as a human being, you have no choice but to answer in one way
or another to the moral demands upon you, however these may be conceptualised.
You could say this is just part of the human condition. Perhaps, even, it is one of the
ways in which we differ from intelligent machines.
1.7
Bottom-Up and Top-Down Approaches to AI Ethics
Summary
Both theory and examples of concrete practical application are equally needed in
discussing ethics.
One of the reasons why some resist anything labelled ‘ethics’ is because it can often
seem as if it involves imposing some abstract theory onto a concrete situation in
ways that fail adequately to capture or fully comprehend grounded reality. This is
indeed sometimes the case and demonstrates the necessity of good dialogue and
understanding with those with subject matter expertise. Theories of ethics need to be
responsive to the real world. As has already been hinted at, especially in the case of
AI, the phenomenon under examination may cause serious challenges to theory. We
need to think about theories, abstract concepts, and principles, while we also closely
examine what is happening on the ground. Both top down, and bottom up methods
of working, matter. They are irrevocably intertwined.
I ﬁrst started working in earnest on ethical issues in AI in 2016 when I worked on
a project funded by the Future of Life Institute, along with Mike Wooldridge and
Peter Millican, on developing codes of ethics for AI. Naturally, this was a fascinating

project to be involved with, but to be honest, at the start of it, I didn’t think that codes
and regulations were necessarily the most interesting aspects of AI ethics. However,
as I explored the area, I realised more and more that in dealing with codes and
regulations, it was vital to explore ethics per se in the abstract, and how to formalise
ethics, and how to achieve impact on the ground. One thing I have tried to
demonstrate already with our discussion of the Ring of Gyges is that ideas and
writings from a very long time ago, even those formulated in a different context, for
different reasons, and in the form of abstractions such as a particular Greek myth, can
still be fresh and crisp when it comes to considering even the newest technology.

Introduction: Why AI Ethics?
Exercises In particular, you will have plentiful opportunity to contribute to the
‘bottom-up’ part of this in the exercises which refer to concrete applications, and
here you may frequently wish to apply what you have learned to speciﬁc instances of
most interest or relevance to your experience. This book also aims to introduce
aspects of ethical theory at varying levels of depth and to enable readers to explore
aspects in greater detail or in outline only. I hope many readers will be left wanting
more, because a book of this length can never cover ‘everything’. The emphasis will
be on assisting you in formulating and asking relevant questions. Many may of
course choose not to do the exercises, but they aim to raise questions to consider
which may be useful for all readers.
1.8
And What Are You Bringing to This Book?
Summary
The book stresses the need for all of us to contribute to AI ethics. Readers are invited
to reﬂect on the skills and experience they can bring to the subject.
Plato’s teacher was Socrates, who famously never wrote down any works of
philosophy, since on the page, an argument can get misinterpreted and can lie
moribund. Philosophical conversation was everything for Socrates, and this explains
why Plato wrote his texts in the form of dialogue with different characters
representing different positions. However, nonetheless, the written word need not
be left to lie dormant, and readers can and must actively engage with texts. This is
especially so in relation to ethics, or indeed in any subject intended to be of some
practical relevance to the world and to life. Even those of you who have never
studied ethics or consciously read a single thing about it will have plenty to bring to
this work by virtue of the fact that you are alive, and presumably, a thinking, feeling,
human being with connections to others in a social world and some sense of value.
So before we proceed, think about all the things that you have to bring to
understanding AI ethics. Some possibilities are as follows:
You have speciﬁc expertise in AI and in technologies that make use of it.
You have certain opinions about such technologies—problems you have encoun-
tered, things you truly like, and hopes or fears for the future.

1.9
Frequent Criticisms of Ethics
19
You use such technologies in your life and can reﬂect on how they affect you and
those around you. You have some awareness of how your life has changed with its
use—or else you can discuss with others how ‘natural’ it all seems.
You will have been raised in a society or cultural context—and often, more than
one—with implicit or explicit values that you can draw upon. You may have taken
on such values or rejected them.
You may have experience or knowledge of particular religious traditions.
You may have noticed the potential for clashes between values from different
domains of your life and experience.
You may have read books and comics and seen ﬁlms and serials, with examples
of different characters, good, bad, or mixed, and situations which can form material
and examples on which to draw. Some of these characters and situations may come
from real life. This may include sci-ﬁbut can include any genre.
You will very likely have disciplinary expertise from other areas. This can be
from either formal or informal study or experience. It could be from any area. For
example, maybe time spent farming or looking after pets has led you to reﬂect on
what, if anything, is special about humans and how we relate to the rest of the animal
kingdom. This could well be useful to draw on in reﬂecting how humans might
compare to AI or robots.
If you are sceptical about all of this, if you are truly annoyed that someone is
forcing you to study this topic, even cynics have a role—you can play devil’s
advocate to your classmates. By this means you may help others to strengthen
their arguments.
Ethics is sometimes approached as a competition to show off how virtuous one is
and to display all the ‘right’ opinions. A critical attitude (so long as it is sufﬁciently
respectful and constructive) can be immensely useful.
There are doubtless more possibilities. Please add as many as you like.

Frequent Criticisms of Ethics
Summary
We examine and respond to some common criticisms of ethics: that it is concerned
only with theory; that it neglects essential insights from other disciplines; that it
focuses too much on individual responsibility rather than issues of society and
politics; that it tends to represent the views of a narrow and dominant group; and
that it can be little more than whitewashing.
We have looked at some general reasons for scepticism about ethics. However, there
are some more speciﬁc reasons offered to be wary about discussions of ethics in
AI. Despite the many voices and fora where AI ethics is being discussed, debated,
and written about, and despite the many initiatives attempting to implement ethics in
the design of AI and to formulate codes, regulations, and laws focusing on AI ethics,
for some, it is controversial to talk about ‘ethics’ in AI at all. There are various

reasons for this, some better than others. Consideration of these criticisms of ethics
can be useful in trying to improve how we approach our subject.

Introduction: Why AI Ethics?
Ethics is not related to action or responsibility For instance, it is been suggested
by Virginia Dignum, a computer scientist who has worked extensively in AI ethics,
that talk of ethics focuses too much on the theory of what should be done, rather than
on its implementation, and that it would be better to focus on the notion of
responsibility, to emphasise the need for translation into practice [8, p. 6]. Although
it is certainly the case that much discussion of ethics is overly theoretical and that
some indulges in some wild speculation that is far from any practical realities, this is
not an essential part of ethics per se. However, to achieve practical realisation, close
consideration of the context of application and dialogue with others with appropriate
expertise are needed. Many discussions in ethics are theoretical and intended as such
but nonetheless can provide valuable clarity and insights for those who wish to take
work further and make applications to context.
The question of responsibility There are useful warnings to be taken from
Dignum’s point. Work in ethics may be idealistic, and there is a place for this, but
not at the expense of also considering realistic possibilities for implementation and
practical solutions to problems. For instance, idealistic work in ethics sometimes
leads to suggestions that attribute unrealistic levels of responsibility to those working
in technology, for example, for the ongoing impacts on society of certain elements of
software, which conversely fail to identify the responsibilities of powerful actors
such as corporations and governments in relation to the development and applica-
tions of technology. These are related to legal, economic, and political consider-
ations, which brings us to our next point.
Ethics and other disciplines Often, unfortunately, work in ethics does miss much
that other disciplinary approaches could bring. Those working in the social sciences
and in areas such as science and technology studies may lament that philosophical
approaches to ethics fail to take into consideration not only the details of context but
also the insights of theories and concepts from other disciplines. This is undoubtedly
sometimes the case, and this book attempts to illustrate some of the theories and
ideas from beyond mainstream ethics that can help us. For example, many have
pointed out in various ways that many of the most pressing issues in AI concern
power, so that AI ethics should include consideration of the wider social forces and
theories we need to examine to comprehend such issues of power and control.
As such, focus on ‘ethics’ may be seen as a way of placing questions concerning
AI in a silo excluding wider cultural, political, and economic issues. Again, this can
be a danger. This is one reason to emphasise the different and wide-ranging skills
and experience that can be brought to bear. This book clearly focuses on the
discipline of ethics. However, it aims to indicate throughout where there is more
to think about, although it is necessary to emphasise that there will so often be more
to consider.

1.9
Frequent Criticisms of Ethics
21
Is ethics too focused on the individual? A related criticism is that ethics tends to
focus on individuals and not enough on social issues such as justice [9]. We have
seen the suggestion that AI ethics should be about responsibility. However, focusing
on individual responsibility can be a way of avoiding the responsibility of corpora-
tions and of governments. Is ethics just a way of avoiding talking about politics? The
best answer to this question is to think through on a case-by-case basis, considering
whether wider political and social issues need to be considered as an alternative, or,
more likely, in addition. Again, the approach of this book is that broad perspectives
are needed.
Is AI ethics too narrow? Many of the critiques of AI ethics are of its narrowness. A
criticism is often made that much contemporary work in ethics is simply a way of
imposing the views of a narrow section of a narrow part of the world at a speciﬁc and
possibly rather peculiar time of history on others. I agree that there is much to be said
for this criticism, and again, we can only try to do better, and again, this will involve
bringing to bear as many different perspectives and people as possible.
Many years ago, I was teaching a class on environmental ethics. This is a topic
that many naturally feel very strongly about, and it tends to produce powerful
reactions from students. I was interrupted one lecture by a passionate voice from
the back of the classroom: ‘But you’re only taking the point of view of a human
being!’
She was right, of course. In reply, I asked her what point of view she’d like me to
take. I can only ever take the point of view of a human being doing the best I can to
take the point of view of another. Same for each one of us. Likewise, although each
of us can try to be aware of cultural and other personal biases in our discussions of
ethics, we cannot possibly guarantee that all perspectives are covered, and indeed,
pretending we can do so is part of the problem. Again, it’s a criticism that should
keep us on our toes and incline us to dialogue with others.
Is AI ethics just a ruse? Last, for now, consider the misuse of ethics as ethics
washing. ‘Ethics washing’ refers to the practice of visibly, sometimes ostentatiously,
showing to the world that one is taking great care to attend to ethics, while in reality,
doing little or nothing [10, 11]. One might be a corporation setting up an ethics board
that writes codes that never make it into daylight; one might have an ethics checklist
at the start of a project that is ﬁled away and forgotten. Scepticism about the attitude
of corporations to ethics was not helped by the widely publicised ousting from
Google in 2020 of Timnit Gebru, who led a group researching the social and ethical
implications of AI [12]. Ethics may be seen as something bureaucratic or annoying
that one does ﬁrst to ‘get it over and done with’. This certainly can be the case, and
there is already much work that tries to guard against this, for example, initiatives to
ensure that ethics is built into different stages of the design process and into
implementation. However, we must also guard against using the ‘ethics is ethics
washing’ complaint as an excuse not to talk about ethics. It is easy cynically to
dismiss genuine attempts to improve issues by excoriating them as ‘ethics washing’.

Exercise 8
Many technology companies have grand pronouncements on their websites about
their approach to ethics and their values. These may include statements about
speciﬁc steps they are taking, such as appointing an ethics review board. They
may also include statements about speciﬁc campaigns of social value in which
they are engaged. Check out one or two companies’ statements of values and ethics.

The Boundaries and Limits of Ethics
Summary
This section presents an overview of some ways in which other disciplines may
challenge or contribute to ethics. This includes the relevance of empirical data,
methods for interpreting complex social phenomena, and different ways of under-
standing human beings. The application of ethics to practice requires a detailed
understanding of the context and is beyond the scope of this book except in outline.
The relationship between ethics and safety is discussed. While the technical ques-
tions are critical to AI ethics, this book focuses on the contributions of ethics.
We have noted that the issues we will examine in AI ethics will often be understood
better and more fully with the assistance of different disciplinary expertise. In asking
questions of ethics, there are clear overlaps with ﬁelds such as economics, politics,
law, and religion. To formulate and understand responses to ethical questions, there
is often the need for interdisciplinary approaches including social sciences, psychol-
ogy, sociology, history, and of course in relation to AI. We need an understanding of
the underlying technology, and this can include understandings gained from cogni-
tive science, linguistics, and the philosophy of mind.
Here, I give a very brief rundown of some of the ways in which ethics might be
enhanced, or challenged, by other disciplines. How might these disciplines contrib-
ute to ethics?
Empirical data Many disciplines can contribute empirical data, and data of many
different types will be relevant—quantitative and qualitative data, data from differ-
ent sources, historical data, cross-cultural data, data about individuals, and data
about society. The ethics we are interested in ultimately has to be applied, and
hence, we have to know about the impacts of actions in the real world.
Interpreting data The world is not presented to us as simple, unambiguous ‘facts’
that stand on their own. Data must be interpreted, and different disciplines provide
useful lenses through which to read and understand data. Indeed, within different
disciplines, there will be theories and theorists with contrasting opinions on how to
interpret data. For example, an evolutionary biologist produces ﬁndings about the
development of human beings and individual differences. An evolutionary psychol-
ogist may give an interpretation of the forces that led to these individual differences.
A criminologist may ﬁnd them useful in explaining the behaviour of some

individuals. A legal theorist or a philosopher may interpret the criminologist’s
account as relevant or not to a sentencing decision. A prosecution team is likely to
pounce on certain explanations and interpretations that differ from those of the
defence team, and so on.
1.10
The Boundaries and Limits of Ethics
23
The interpretation of social phenomena will be especially relevant for us and
especially vexed and liable to differences of viewpoints. Perspectives may differ
depending upon individual, demographic, and cultural differences.
The human person AI ethics demands that we pay particular attention to the
human person. If AI is to enhance or replace human thought, decision-making,
and agency, and if we wish to assess the development and deployment of AI, then
we need to think about human thought, decision-making, and agency. This is one
area where ethics can gain a great deal by considering the approaches of different
disciplines. Different branches of psychology have different insights and theories to
offer, and this is likewise the case for sociology, anthropology, and biology.
Disciplines such as economics may make assumptions about persons and their
motivations which are questioned by other disciplines. Work in ethics absolutely
must take advantage of and reﬂect upon and respond to these ideas, which can be of
great utility. However, some of these ideas directly challenge much of ethics.
Challenges to ethics Some theories and methodological approaches have been
used to cast doubt upon or even debunk work in ethics. For example, claims may
be made that discoveries and methodologies have concluded that ethical arguments
are based upon ‘nothing but’ subjective opinions explained completely by, vari-
ously, evolutionary theory, cultural forces, individual psychology, economic forces,
and so on. Conversely, other work may be drawn upon to enrich or modify debate in
ethics, such as work suggesting that there are commonalities in moral codes around
the globe and throughout history or work suggesting that personality type may
inﬂuence and sometimes limit how ethical and social issues are thought about and
assessed. This is not the place to examine in any depth arguments that purport to
debunk entirely the endeavour of ethics. However, there truly is plenty to learn and
to ponder about, and anything which challenges ethics where it needs to be chal-
lenged, and anything ethics can learn from and improve, is and should be of interest.
Exercise 9
You may well have come across people who consider that ethics is simply a matter
of opinion or that it is a way of disguising self-interest as concern for others, and so
on. You may even think this yourself. Outline a few thoughts for and against such
a view.
Ethics, action, and application Ethics is strongly linked to action. On some
philosophical views, the making of a moral judgement, the appreciation of what is
the best thing to do, leads immediately to such action, although a view more
commonly held is now that the motivation to act morally arises with a degree of
independence from judgement. If ethics is purely theoretical, it seems to lack a
central aspect. The formal and academic discussion of ethics may or may not be

geared towards making recommendations for practice. The attitude that all discus-
sion of ethics in any applied ﬁeld ought to be making speciﬁc recommendations for
practice seems to be rather common, judging from critical appraisal by anonymous
reviewers on many journal articles submitted for publication and expectations aired
elsewhere. However, recommendations for practice need to be ﬁnely tuned to
speciﬁc contexts and to the pragmatic consideration of what might actually work
in speciﬁc situations. Local and detailed knowledge is always needed. This textbook
therefore is not aimed at such. However, it is hoped that a greater understanding of
the issues aired here will contribute to attempts to achieve practical results, and much
of our discussion and many exercises are designed to prompt reﬂection on the
context of application.

Introduction: Why AI Ethics?
AI ethics and AI safety In developing AI, and likewise for developing computing
programmes and systems and engineering in general, the concern for safety is well
established. Safety necessitates ensuring that systems reliably achieve the goals that
we wish them to achieve, without unacceptable dangers, including both long-term
and short-term risks. Concern for safety is, or at least should be, built into the
principles of engineering design. The complexity of AI means that considerable
work is involved in ascertaining and checking safety, much of which is highly
technical. The ‘black box’ nature of much AI is one cause for particular concerns,
resulting in considerable efforts in technical work to ensure as much transparency in
systems as possible. There are many reasons to consider that AI raises especially
vexed questions concerning safety, among them issues of power and control, with
the scaling up of systems and their complexity, meaning that the potential for harm
from any safety problems could often be immense.
‘Normal Accidents’ and AI Safety
Charles Perrow developed a theory of ‘normal accidents’ in his book Normal
Accidents: Living with High-Risk Technologies (1984) after examining the
causes of the Three Mile Island nuclear accident, a partial meltdown of a
nuclear power station in 1979 [13]. ‘Normal accidents’ are inevitable in
technological systems which are highly complex and where the interacting
elements are tightly coupled, and where the potential for error could be
catastrophic. The role of organisations surrounding technologies in creating
and mitigating risk is emphasised. Perrow’s theory has been inﬂuential in
contributing to understandings of safety and risk in technological systems.
It has been claimed that AI systems are prone to ‘normal accidents’. Hence,
it has been argued that organisations using AI that could have deleterious
impacts need to be highly reliable [14], and that regulations around AI need to
take the characteristics that lead to normal accidents into account [15]. Among
other things, this illustrates how tightly connected are technical safety issues to
questions of regulation and organisation which involve human elements,
judgements of value, and ethics.

1.11
The Approach of This Book
25
The technical work involved in attempting to ensure the safety and reliability of
AI systems is of paramount importance, and there are obvious links with questions in
ethics, such as the consideration of the goals built into AI systems, the regulation of
AI and its development, and assessing the impacts of the deployment of AI systems
in the real world and their wider repercussions.
While this book recognises the necessity and importance of the technical side of
these questions, here we concentrate on exploring the ethical issues both in general
and on questions where there are direct implications for work in safety, such as the
issues of transparency and the related issue of whether a particular instance of AI can
be explained, and the very important general issue of how we set goals and assess
consequences. This is a necessary element of more technical work focused on the
implementation of ethics in AI.
The implementation of ethics The link between theory and practice in ethics is
critical. You can produce all the robust conclusions about AI ethics that you like, but
if these are never translated into policy and practice, little is achieved, as Virginia
Dignum and others have emphasised. This book fully recognises the importance of
law, regulation, strategies to incorporate ethics into the design and use of products,
and responsible research and innovation in this ﬁeld, but these are complex areas that
cannot be addressed here. One aim of this book is to assist readers in being able to
contribute as effectively and creatively as possible to such work as it continues into
the future. The interrelationship between theory and application is critical to ethics
and naturally critical to implementation.
However, one set of questions about AI ethics can be immediately up to you—
your own use of technologies involving AI, how you choose to interact with these,
and indeed, the question of whether or not you even have a choice. I hope this book
will enhance and develop your thoughts and actions about the impacts of AI on
your life.
1.11
The Approach of This Book
Summary
This book stresses methodology but does not propose a ﬁxed approach. It aims to
assist readers to think through issues rather than to provide deﬁnite solutions to
questions. It recognises the contributions of other disciplines to these questions,
including technological expertise, but focuses on the contribution of ethics.
By now some of the ways this book will approach ethical questions in AI should be
becoming clear. This book aims to equip readers to develop skills and understanding
to contribute to the development and use of these new technologies; to introduce
philosophical and ethical ideas so that you can understand and contribute to some of
the complexity of the debates; and, in the course of this, to look at cases, methods,
and concepts. You will be introduced to some important and basic ideas and thinkers

in ethics and show how they relate to contemporary debates in AI. This is not the
kind of textbook that gives answers on a topic that you need to learn to pass an exam
or gain proﬁciency in a subject, although there will be plenty of material intended to
inform.
26
1
Introduction: Why AI Ethics?
Methodologies in ethics are stressed, but this book does not provide a ﬁxed
‘method’ Readers will not ﬁnd a formula or ﬁxed strategy for approaching ethical
questions in AI. There are books around that aspire to lay out detailed methodologies
for working through ethical questions in the design of technology, which can have
great utility, but this is not one of them [16]. However, you will be guided through
questions of methodology in ethics and shown some ways in which ethical questions
can be approached. Many ideas will be introduced in preliminary ways and returned
to later in more detail or from different angles. By this means you should develop
your understanding and deepen your capacity to contribute to the ﬁeld.
Since it is essential to apply ideas to concrete cases, there will be plenty of
exercises, many for individuals, and some for groups, and examples of cases on
which to draw. The book can be used in class or by those reading alone, by those
with an informal interest, and by those who are studying the subject in detail. The
book is laid out so that it will be possible to skim over some sections in less detail, for
those with limited time or with different backgrounds and interests, and focus more
on others.
From the simple to the complex Because one aim of this book is to show how
material from different ﬁelds can be brought to bear upon the questions of AI ethics,
it is necessary to simplify and generalise on many points. This is partly a matter of
space and partly because sometimes such simpliﬁcation is necessary to demonstrate
broad patterns, contrasting, synergistic, or overlapping issues and concepts. There
hence will be considerable work to be done, building up detail, context, and nuance,
and many points at which exceptions and subtleties can be found. The book
recognises that many of the pointers to topics that merit attention are very introduc-
tory only. This only serves to indicate the potential for those with particular interests
and expertise to work together on these issues.
1.12
Developing Ethical Autonomy
Summary
The importance in ethics of thinking and acting with autonomy is introduced; this is
an especially important issue in relation to the control that AI may have over our
lives.
One of the major groups of questions in AI ethics concerns control and autonomy.
One of the main fears about AI is that it will rob us of agency. Perhaps by developing
into a superintelligence that usurps control, perhaps by stealthily taking away
decision-making power app by app, or by diminishing our capacities as we rely

more and more on machines to do our thinking for us. Partly inspired by the wish to
counter this, this book aims to enhance your capacities to think in this area, your
agency. Of course this is not meant to imply that you won’t already have such
capacity; the book’s contribution is particular to offering certain considerations.
1.12
Developing Ethical Autonomy
27
On many views of ethics (but not all), someone who simply follows instructions,
whether from a human or a machine, is not acting as a fully moral being. If thought,
reﬂection, and intention are critical to moral action, then the more one can develop
one’s understanding of ethical issues, the more one can explain one’s views and
actions, the more one can fully consider all aspects of a question before responding,
and then the greater one’s agency and autonomy will be. Even if we act in compli-
ance with the orders of others, we make them our own by agreeing with them or at
least seeing their point. We will also need to understand sets of moral rules to be able
to interpret how to apply them in new cases.
There is complexity here because how precisely one should develop understand-
ing and capacity in ethics is in dispute. Some views focus on reason and rationality;
some focus on feelings and empathy; some focus on elaborate theory; some focus on
ﬁne attention to context and to the matter at hand; and some focus on developing
character. We will consider these issues throughout the book.
If a focus is on developing ethical autonomy, on ethical agency, and on thinking
for oneself, does this mean that the aim is to see ethics as something merely personal,
simply a ‘choice’ like the choice between colour of socks? No, because autonomy is
a richer notion than this. Thinking through matters for yourself in ethics certainly
does not mean having to come up with an idiosyncratic, counterintuitive, or unusual
answer (although it may do). Autonomy does not mean lawlessness or randomness.
We can more aptly think of developing the capacity to think a matter through, to
make it one’s own, to display a kind of authenticity or agency. We can also, very
importantly, think of ethical autonomy as building the capacity to refuse to comply
with behaviour and instructions when such refusal is appropriate, the capacity to do
more than simply follow the crowd (although not at the expense of rejecting any
relevant wisdom the crowd may have).
Moral Autonomy: Actions in Accordance with Duty, and Actions
for the Sake of Duty
One inﬂuential view of moral autonomy is found in Immanuel Kant’s work,
Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals [17]. A distinction he made
between different motivations for following a moral rule is useful to consider
in reﬂecting on the idea of autonomy in ethical judgement and action. Kant’s
distinction is very often misunderstood, uncontroversial in some respects,
highly controversial in others. Kant distinguished between acting out of
reverence for the moral law and acting in conformity with the law. We do
not need all the details of Kant’s somewhat complex philosophy in order to
grasp the essentials.

Introduction: Why AI Ethics?
Imagine a shopkeeper who always gives the right change to customers.
One shopkeeper gives the right change out of fear of getting caught. He
does a good thing, to be sure, with a good outcome, but most would agree there
is little moral merit to his character. After all, consider the Ring of Gyges.
A second shopkeeper gives the right change just because he’s a cheerful,
nice sort of chapter. For Kant, likewise, this shopkeeper’s actions produce
good in the world, but the action itself has no moral worth. Many disagree or
are even shocked at Kant’s claim. The shopkeeper sounds exactly like the kind
of person you’d want running your local store.
A third shopkeeper always gives the right change out of what Kant calls
reverence or respect for the moral law. This involves consciously considering
the situation, determining the right course of action, and then giving the right
change precisely because it is the right thing to do. One’s precise motivation
for action is key.
Critics of Kant consider this a cold way of dealing with people, and indeed
there is a lot to be said for more spontaneous views of moral motivation.
However, it illustrates one way of thinking about what it is to have moral
autonomy: to deliberate and act with insight and care, making an informed and
consciously chosen action.
Exercise 10
A shopkeeper always gives the right change because the shop is now automated.
Using surveillance, a shopper’s bill is automatically calculated as items are placed in
their basket, and the money automatically leaves each shopper’s bank account as
they walk out through the front door. The shop is part of a franchise owned by a vast
international corporation that sets the rules for how the shops operate.
Does the owner of the shop deserve any moral praise if customers always receive
accurate bills?
If automation takes over a multitude of simple everyday functions such as
charging customers accurately, will this give us less time to exercise our moral
agency?
If a machine follows a rule of morality, or indeed, a rule of anything else, can
there be a distinction between the machine acting in conformity with the rule and
acting out of respect for the rule?
Could a machine determine whether a rule it is following is a moral rule?
Note: in all such exercises and examples, feel free to produce variations of your
own to test out your thoughts.

Why Examine Underlying Concepts in AI Ethics?
Summary
In addition to looking at concrete issues, much of this book is devoted to examining
concepts underlying ethical claims. There are many reasons for this, including the
contribution it can make towards understanding the approaches of those from diverse
cultures and backgrounds.
There are so many practical and pressing concerns in AI ethics that there may be a
certain impatience with spending too much time considering theoretical and abstract
issues. However, there are many good reasons to contemplate questions of AI ethics
even for those who are in general somewhat sceptical about the methods and
promises of ethics as a discipline: in order to understand others and to understand
the nature of the important and often heated debates around AI. These issues have
individual, societal, and global impacts and are shaping our societies as we go into
the future. Looking deeply into the ethical questions is a very good way of helping to
understand why others differ from you, to perhaps come to an agreement, or an
acceptable compromise, and to search more deeply and more creatively for solu-
tions. Diving deeply into disagreements can often help to pinpoint the root source of
differences and help identify whether these are fundamental divergences of view-
point and worldview or something that could be addressed by more pragmatic or
practical means.
Examining underlying conceptual issues can assist in understanding cultural
differences We can also often ﬁnd that an ethical dispute is grounded in political
differences or in divergent religious or secular worldviews. There are particular
reasons to be especially alert to cultural and other differences of opinion in regard
to AI because it has such global reach and such far-reaching potential to impact so
much of our lives, yet its development is dominated by a very small section of the
human population with their own viewpoints and idiosyncrasies. So we know at the
outset that there are going to be different views, and a question is how to cope with
this, and how to consider whether or not dominant views on AI and on ethics are
being imposed on others, and if so, how. It would be foolish to try to produce a book
which ‘covers all opinions’ and indeed, I would still be here decades from now
vainly trying to ﬁnish it. Rather, the book’s strategy is to help facilitate an awareness
of the right kind of questions to ask. Often, this can be assisted by examining one’s
own underlying assumptions and values and at the conceptual frameworks that lie
beneath these.
For example, beliefs in ethics may be found to draw upon metaphysical views
about the nature of persons, which can help to explain differences of opinion and
approach. This may well not lead to anyone involved changing their mind, but it can
lead to greater mutual understanding, which has to be something to be valued. We
may sometimes come to realise that when we assumed that our views were based
upon the ‘facts’ of the matter, these ‘facts’ only appeared unshakeable because they
relied upon assumptions that we had not realised may be questioned.

1.14
Why Am I Writing This Book?
Summary
Just a personal note on how I started working in this area.
In this book, I strive to present different viewpoints and a wide variety of
approaches; this is not a book intended to push personal viewpoints. However, it’s
inevitable that these will creep in. In class, wherever there are topics on which I feel
particularly strongly, I tend to warn my students that I might be biased about them so
that they can take that into account in listening to me. Likewise, I obviously don’t
know everything, so my background knowledge and viewpoints are bound to
inﬂuence what I have included, what I have left out, and how I have presented
issues. This is one of the reasons why the book includes exercises and stresses not
only the capacities of theories, concepts, and methodologies of ethics to contribute
but also the limits of what ethics as a discipline can do.
A brief outline of how I came to write this book. I started an interest in philosophy
as a teenager. Contrary to what you might expect from an academic, I detested my
school and often used to skip class to wander into central London nosing around in
second-hand bookshops or to read philosophy in the local library. I now realise of
course that I understood very little of what I read. As a teenager, I was fascinated
with the question of the possibilities and limitations of thought and of what we can
learn about the world from thought alone. I specialised in sciences at school,
expecting to fail my exams, but miraculously did well enough to get into university.
I studied physics as an undergraduate, and then switched to philosophy and psy-
chology, with a minor in computer science, before specialising in philosophy at the
graduate level. My graduate studies included philosophical logic and philosophy of
language, with a doctorate in philosophy of mind, although my primary interest has
always been ethics, both metaethics and applied ethics. I got into working in AI
ethics through a background of working with various interdisciplinary teams with
medics, lawyers, discourse analysts, social scientists, computer scientists, and geno-
mics research scientists, looking at issues in medical ethics and social and ethical
issues in genetics and genomics and in dementia care.
I then happened to be teaching in Oxford in 2015 when the Future of Life Institute
announced a programme of grants for work in ethical issues around AI, and I had the
opportunity to work on a project examining how to develop codes of ethics for AI,
along with Mike Wooldridge and Peter Millican. My past work in medical and
genomic technologies turned out to have many overlaps with issues in AI, including
questions concerning data and how science and technologies inﬂuence how we
conceptualise the human subject. I continue to work with a team researching how
to improve dementia care, and there are also many overlaps there too, not just in the
technologies being trialled to help with dementia care, research, and diagnosis but
also at a fundamental level in terms of how we relate to and conceptualise the human
person. I truly do believe that AI ethics is the most exciting ﬁeld of applied ethics and
that it has a great potential for improving the ﬁeld of applied ethics, but more

importantly, for helping to energise and vitalise discussion about what it means to
lead a great human life, both now and in the future.

What Is to Come
The ﬁrst few chapters of the book present frameworks for asking and answering
questions in AI ethics, drawing from philosophy but noting the critical importance of
the contribution of other disciplines. There are exercises and practical examples of
cases throughout. Chapter 2 will give readers some background to the current intense
interest in ethical questions in AI. It gives an overview of some relevant historical
responses to technology.
Chapter 3 then provides an account of some major questions within the philos-
ophy of technology, which will enrich our understanding of the ethical issues
concerning AI.
Chapter 4 will look at the vexed question of methodology—how can we approach
these questions with any degree of rigour?
Chapter 5 dives deeper into some key questions for AI ethics: how we understand
and value intelligence and, since one of the major issues is how we compare humans
and AI, our understanding of human nature.
Chapter 6 gives an overview of the central theories in normative ethics, conse-
quentialism, deontology, and virtue ethics, assessing their usefulness in the speciﬁc
context of AI.
Chapter 7 dives deeper into philosophy, asking what further questions we need to
ask about the foundations of ethics and how other areas of philosophy, such as
philosophy of mind, are also essential for understanding the ethics of AI.
Chapter 8 then looks in detail at issues central to ethics and of paramount
importance in AI ethics: how we understand and value persons and how we
understand and value autonomy and its limits.
Chapter 9 examines concrete ethical issues currently facing us, focusing on online
communication and content moderation as an example to illustrate approaches to
applying the earlier material of the book to a tangible and complex issue.
Chapter 10 looks at two contrasting sets of ethical questions, ﬁrst, on a range of
issues connected with AI and work, including its impact on society in the future, and
second, at the dangers that might be posed by superintelligence.
Chapter 11 asks further questions about how the far future of humanity might be
like if AI continues to develop and addresses a set of questions around our relation-
ships with intelligent machines, including the question of whether machines could be
ethical and if we might owe them moral respect.

Introduction: Why AI Ethics?
1.16
Key Points
The essential message of this chapter is that AI ethics presents difﬁcult but exciting
challenges; that ethics should ideally be regarded as an activity and an opportunity to
contribute to valuable discussions on important questions of value; and that each
person will have something to offer.
1.17
Educator Notes
This chapter involves no previous reading or study and hence could be set to be
completed before the ﬁrst week of term or in the ﬁrst week as light homework when
students are being oriented to the subject matter; most of the exercises will require no
previous reading, although a few involve a small amount of research. Points to
emphasise include the view of ethics as involving dialogue and necessitating differ-
ent viewpoints and contributions from other disciplines.
The chapter contains summaries of each major section and headings and bold text
leading students through the main points, enabling students with different time
commitments to skim certain sections. If students simply attempt some of the
exercises, they will have gained a useful orientation to the rest of the book.
The most important key takeaway is that ethics should be seen in positive ways,
as an open-ended discussion and an opportunity to contribute to improving the
development and applications of AI, rather than as a negative list of prohibitions
imposed from outside. Exercises 1, 2, 6, and 9 may be attempted with little reading to
orient students to the focus of the book.
Exercise 7 on the Ring of Gyges and Exercise 10 on Kant’s views on moral
motivation may also provide entertaining and thought-provoking introductions to
the area and how philosophy can help us to think through some issues that will be
looked at again later in the book.
The exercises given in each chapter are designed to be suitable for different levels
of students and for individual and/or group work. These will introduce cases and
issues in AI ethics to cover a variety of different themes and applications. Many can
be adapted so that readers can apply their own particular realms of interest. Some of
the cases and themes will be returned to later in the book to illustrate how the
material of the book is equipping students with skills to deepen their analysis and
understanding of issues and methods. Exercise topics that might be particularly
useful for class debate and discussion or for extended projects or essays are
indicated.
Note Any reading list in this area will fail to cover all the possible worthwhile texts,
since so much is being written.

The Rise of AI Ethics
Abstract This chapter presents an overview of the present state of AI ethics, its
main themes, and some of the factors that lead up to the current state of play. An
overview of the most prominent value issues in current guidance concerning AI
ethics is given, with introductions to these issues, brief case studies for each, and
exercises to draw out questions, many of which will be pursued at greater length
throughout the book. These are freedom and autonomy, justice and fairness, trans-
parency and explanation, beneﬁcence and nonmaleﬁcence, responsibility, privacy,
trust, sustainability, dignity, and solidarity. We explore how having some under-
standing of relevant historical concerns about technology can help to illuminate
current concerns regarding AI, looking brieﬂy at historical apprehensions regarding
robots, the technologies of writing, machines, data and statistics, and twentieth-
century concerns about computing that preceded speciﬁc concerns about AI. An
overview of the current state of AI ethics and endeavours to implement ethical
guidance in policy and practice is given. Last, we look at a case study of indigenous
AI protocols and ask what can be learned from considering diverse perspectives.

AI Ethics: Why Now?
Summary
We start by asking why there is currently so much attention to AI ethics. AI is often
described as a new Industrial Revolution. Some further interest has been piqued by
particular questions around our dependence on technologies following the COVID-
19 pandemic. AI is also frequently hailed as transformative.
Visible concern about AI ethics has grown rapidly in the last few years. Centres
dedicated to AI ethics are springing up, corporations and companies involved in AI
are appointing ethics boards or ethics advisers, governments are funding research
and reports into AI ethics and safety, popular magazines, serious newspapers, radio
programmes, blog posts, and online video channels discuss AI ethics, and prominent

ﬁgures pronounce on the dangers and delights of AI. AI ethics certainly does seem to
have captured the imagination of many people in recent times. However, it is
important to realise in all this ﬂurry of recent activity that concern for ethical issues
in AI, in robotics, and in computing more widely is not in fact as newly minted as it
may appear.

The Rise of AI Ethics
Why is there now so much visible activity around AI ethics? Might this rise in
interest in AI be some kind of fad linked to, say, funding or corporate issues? Might
it be linked to a hyping of technology which will die down when we realise it’s not
so dangerous, or so transformative, as at ﬁrst appeared? Recall the announcements
about the completion of the Human Genome Project to sequence the human genome
around the turn of the century [1]. There was talk at the time of having ‘cracked the
code’ to human life, unlocked the mystery to our great and marvellous species. This
was accompanied by a certain amount of discomfort at the discovery that human
beings have embarrassingly few genes compared to some other species, roughly the
same number as some primitive worms. Nevertheless, not only was there excitement
that we could now, apparently, ﬁnally ‘fully understand’ humanity, but there was
also more practical excitement that now we could personalise medicine, discover the
causes of a multiplicity of diseases, create new reproductive technologies, and so
on. Along with this, there was, quite rightly, considerable attention to ethical issues.
This all continues but has calmed down considerably. Much of the promise of
personalised medicine was somewhat premature, many of the studies into the origins
of disease had failed to produce the practical applications hoped for, and more and
more research indicated that the genome was by no means the be all and end all, and
that various complex environmental factors in development were also critical. More
nuanced assessments of the human genome are being made with realisations that
considerable work lies ahead [2]. Perhaps something similar might happen to the
extreme hype and attention to AI and to AI ethics?
A new Industrial Revolution? On the other hand, we already saw in the last
chapter that there are many reasons to pay attention to ethical issues in AI. For one
thing, the ubiquity of use and pace of change of technology. Technology has
developed rapidly, in historical terms, since the First Industrial Revolution where
water and steam power mechanised production, the Second Industrial Revolution
where electricity increased production still further, and the Third Industrial Revolu-
tion which introduced digital technologies including AI. Many consider that we are
now entering the Fourth Industrial Revolution where interconnections between
digital, physical, and biological technologies accelerate industrial and social changes
[3, 4]. Anticipation, excitement, and anxiety about such large changes might explain
and justify the current attention to AI and to its ethics. The history of AI shows that it
has shown promise, then stalled, then shown promise, and then stalled again over the
last several decades, with much rapid progress in recent years. Much of this progress
is in machine learning, enabled by the rise of massive amounts of data and an
increase in computing power that has enabled the collection and processing of that
data. This recent burst of progress, with an increasing number of applications of

artiﬁcial intelligence in the workplace and in public and private life, could certainly
help explain the intense interest in AI ethics.
2.1
AI Ethics: Why Now?
37
A technological pandemic? More recently, attention to particular issues regarding
our use of and dependence upon technologies has been forced on us by the COVID-
19 pandemic, where remote working and online shopping have become a necessity
for so many (and, one might add, a sine qua non of lockdown policies) and where
track-and-trace surveillance technologies to monitor the disease and vaccine pass-
ports necessary in many places for movement of people have been both hailed as
indispensably useful and decried as creeping authoritarian control [5].
It is this ‘duck-rabbit’ feature of so much AI that helps to create such interest. It is
so often, precisely those features which some hail as great boons to humanity, that
others lament as portents of our doom—sometimes expressed in milder language, of
course. It is often the aspects that inspire the greatest hopes that ﬁll others with the
greatest dread.
Cassandra
Those who claim that new technologies such as AI are going to cause great
difﬁculties and dangers for humanity are sometimes decried as ‘Cassandras’.
However, who was Cassandra?
Cassandra was a priestess of Troy, daughter of the King and Queen of Troy.
The god Apollo sought to woo her with the promise of the gift of foreseeing
the future. She accepted the gift, but then refused Apollo. Infuriated, he cursed
her. Cassandra’s prophesies were accurate. Her curse was to be doomed to
warn of great danger, only to be ignored.
Our problem is that it’s very hard to know what prophesies regarding AI
will come true.
However, perhaps it is something about the particular and complex ways in which
AI seems to herald our futures that explains the extent of recent interest in it and its
ethics. Could it be that the interest in its ethics only seems to be so novel precisely
because AI always seems to be about what is new, and not just that, but about what is
hailed as transformative? Some work examining the nature of AI and examining its
ethics perhaps serves to reinforce such ideas, even if many claims of novelty and
success turn out to be exaggerated. For many of the ways in which we speak of and
imagine AI speak of our place in the world and of our futures. AI sits in a space
occupied both by science and technology, a place of rationality, of statistics, of
formulae, and of empiricism, and at once, a place of the imagination and of extremes
of feeling. It sits both in the minutiae of the present, a world cluttered with
technologies using AI, and in the inchoate future unfolding in ways of peril or
promise. It has entered the world at a particular time in history, and while it is being
developed in various parts of the globe, much of it comes from a section of the
Western world that, in historical and global terms, is currently unusually irreligious

[6]. It is hard not to wonder if some of the ways in which it is being imagined and
discussed suggest that for some, AI is stepping into a space left by religious belief.

The Rise of AI Ethics
What the Internet Tells Us About the Transformative Power of AI
A few seconds spent on a search engine reveals claims that:
AI is supercharging economic growth
Transforming the management of business revenues
And the business landscape in general
As well as transforming the experience of employees
Transforming healthcare in general
And precision medicine in particular
As well as drug discovery
It’s transforming the Pentagon
And the automotive and aerospace industries
It’s revolutionising several critical sectors of the economy
And science in general
The list goes on . . .
If these claims are all true, they will bring with them many ethical and
social questions.
If they are exaggerated or even false, the fact that they are made so regularly
likewise gives rise to many ethical and social questions.
2.2
Same or Different? What’s Special About AI Ethics?
Summary
AI ethics is often hailed as novel. However, it is also critical to understand how its
issues might overlap with other areas.
We need to carefully and accurately examine any issue in front of us. Even if we are
now facing many urgent questions about AI ethics, this does not mean that the issues
themselves are entirely novel. Claims of the novelty of issues in AI ethics may not
only be exaggerated or overgeneralised but may also mislead us into omitting to
consider useful lessons, parallels, and contrasts that could be found in previous work
and in examples drawn from more mundane technologies, or indeed from elsewhere
in life.
Why does this question matter? If there truly are new ethical questions in AI,
these may need some new ways of thinking. However, insofar as ethical issues are
the same, we can draw upon the past and present examples.
We have long had to deal with questions about the safety and robustness of our
technologies [7]. No history of the Industrial Revolution could leave out ethical,
social, cultural, and political issues about issues such as the complex mix of dangers
and opportunities, risks, and beneﬁts posed to factory workers, transport workers,

miners, the general public, and the environment, by the new machinery being
introduced and the increased possibilities for mining, for transport, and for the
exploitation of the environment.
2.2
Same or Different? What’s Special About AI Ethics?
39
The automation of tasks raised complex issues. For example, not only did it act to
create uniformity of products, but it also enabled the imposition of uniformity of
behaviour on employees. It would give rise to a variety of political and social
reactions: to unions, to charitable work concerned with the working poor, to social
reformers, and to political theorists of different stripes. Issues extended well beyond
the factory: the extremely long hours and low pay of workers would mean harsh
living conditions for families, malnutrition, poor health, and decreasing life expec-
tancies. Furthermore, the greater the power is, the worse the potential accident. This
may help explain why air travel is, somewhat paradoxically, the safest form of
transport because the appalling and grimly spectacular nature of aircraft crashes
has spurred air safety to great lengths to prevent disasters. Perhaps AI raises
essentially the same spectrum of issues, but with greater potential to disrupt and
cause mayhem, given its powers?
A critically important question is whether ethical questions in AI have been
exaggerated by misplaced fears, possibly based upon misconceptions of what AI is
or can do. In the next chapter, we take a closer look at how AI is understood and the
implications this has for deﬁning and dealing with ethical issues. However, one
possible view is that many if not most of the ethical questions are basically questions
about the safety of the technology and determining how to ensure that complex
software performs as we intended it to perform.
Exercise 1
Workplaces are increasingly using AI for surveillance of their employees [8]. This
includes software that monitors employees’ work to determine if they are spending
too much time away from their core activities; facial recognition software to ensure
that unauthorised people are not let into the ofﬁce, or that employees remain focused
on their computer screen; and location trackers to monitor how they move around the
workplace. Such software may also be used remotely to monitor employees working
at home. Trackers on vehicles can also monitor the location and driving skills of
delivery drivers and taxis. These technologies are receiving considerable attention.
Other examples of new technologies used to control the behaviour of employees
include posts and photographs of employees’ mistakes on shared chats (this hap-
pened to my daughter!).
What ethical issues are raised? How are the concerns of both employees and
employers best represented? This may differ in different industries.
How novel are such concerns, and does the introduction of AI bring novel ethical
questions to bear?
Note: you may or may not wish to carry out further research into the details of
workplace surveillance while doing this exercise. You may have relevant ﬁrst-hand
experience.

Common Themes and Varieties of Questions in AI
Ethics
Summary
AI ethics encompasses a large variety of issues. This section presents a way of
grouping together some major themes. The general nature of AI, versus detailed
aspects; current issues, or concerns about the far future; how to address errors in AI,
and how to address the deleterious impacts of AI’s success; questions of knowledge
and human relations: how are we seen via AI, and how do we see others? Do we
control AI, or does AI control us?
AI ethics encompasses so many different questions of a large variety of types that it
may be helpful to outline some broad themes to categorise the ﬁeld so that readers
can orient themselves to future material, although there are different ways of
categorising the plethora of questions in the ﬁeld. Addressing different types of
questions will require some different approaches, draw on a variety of resources, and
link to different sets of background assumptions and issues.
Whole or part Some questions in AI ethics deal with general issues about AI
conceptualised as a whole, while others focus on speciﬁc applications of AI or
speciﬁc technical details about AI. For example, there are debates about whether
some artiﬁcial general intelligence (AGI) is possible but also ethical debates about
how human beings might stand in relation to such an AGI (see Chap. 11). Such a
debate needs to draw upon knowledge and understanding of technological possibil-
ities, and will raise rather broad questions about human beings and the human
condition. There are also debates and practical work underway about the ethical
implications of how different forms of machine learning represent the world, as well
as work examining in detail whether and how human beings can understand speciﬁc
instances of machine learning (transparency and explainability—see Sect. 2.4.2).
These obviously require speciﬁc technological expertise, especially for implemen-
tation, but addressing these involves asking what it is to understand something and
why understanding matters, questions that may be surprisingly complex.
Now and then Closely related is a division between domains of AI ethics that focus
on developments of AI in the future, and possibly the very far future, and what these
might mean for us, and those that address current or near future possibilities. There is
a debate about how resources and energy should be expended between these, with
some arguing that it is foolish to focus effort on the far future when present issues are
so numerous and so pressing [9]. Others, such as Nick Bostrom, argue that future
possibilities are so fraught with peril that it would be foolish, even reckless, not to
address them. Bostrom’s best-selling book Superintelligence tackles the dangers of a
possible superintelligence that might become so powerful that it could wreak great
harm to humanity, and how we might be able to control this [10]. Such consider-
ations draw upon projections into the distant future, which are, unsurprisingly, often
disputed.

2.3
Common Themes and Varieties of Questions in AI Ethics
41
Conversely, it is readily apparent that a plethora of questions about AI and its
current and near future applications need to be tackled and are already receiving
attention.
Moore’s Law
Many projections of the future development of AI are based upon Moore’s law
[11], which is the law, or more accurately, a rough generalisation extrapolated
from a few decades’ observation, that computing capacity doubles approxi-
mately every 18 months; many propose that this doubling will continue into
the future. These projections are then often used to conclude that we need to
take serious notice of the major issues that will arise if AI continues to develop
greater and greater intelligence.
Mike Wooldridge points out that this applies to the capacities of hardware,
rather than software, upon which much progress in AI depends, hence casting
doubt on free and easy predictions about computing progress [12].
Moreover, what would it be to develop ‘greater and greater intelligence’
such that new forms of threats of control of us puny humans arise? Much
hangs on this answer.
Bug or feature: how things go wrong The fear of a superintelligence taking
control of our destiny concerns the hazards of what Bostrom dubs ‘perverse instan-
tiation’, the problem of how to get an intelligent machine to do what we asked it to
do, only to ﬁnd it does something disastrously different. This problem is the essence
of many stories, such as asking a genie for three wishes only to ﬁnd that the
command has been executed in unfortunate ways. Isaac Asimov’s famous robot
stories likewise frequently address these questions [13]. Beginning students in
computer science may often be tasked with trying to write out precisely how to
programme a task so that a person, or machine, following speciﬁcations will produce
what you actually intended. Not easy. The most boring English literature homework
I ever had to do at school involved the tedious task of describing in utterly precise
and idiot-proof language how to wash a car. Now just imagine setting up instructions
for the most superpowerful AI ever to exist, and imagine the havoc that could be
caused.
Many of the potential problems of AI are those of ironing out bugs, which will be
the harder the more complex AI is and the wider its ﬁelds of application. These may
be regarded as technical issues of safety, of validation or veriﬁcation of a product.
These terms are sometimes understood and explained in slightly different ways.
Veriﬁcation refers to the process by which it is determined whether a product
complies with speciﬁcations. Validation refers to the process that ensures that the
goals or requirements of a product are met by the speciﬁcations [14, 15].
We considered in Chap. 1 the relationship between ethics and issues of safety
[16]. As such, these issues of ironing out bugs involve technical skills and the
capacity to programme in exactly what you want to get out. However, the more

complex the issues involved are, the more complex the technologies, and these
become more than a matter of technical know-how. There can often be a multitude of
ramiﬁcations in using AI, or any other complex system for that matter, involving
complex methodologies and requiring different disciplinary expertise, as well as
input from anyone who might count as a ‘stakeholder’. This, in many cases, is
practically all of us. However, a basic question in ensuring that AI does what we
want is this: what do we want?

The Rise of AI Ethics
Bug or feature: how things go right Many ethical questions regarding AI stem not
from ways in which it goes wrong but from ways in which it goes right, insofar as it
fulﬁls the aims of the designers. We can specify aims under a certain description, but
when it is fulﬁlled, we realise that there are implications of our own speciﬁcations
that were not intended. Moreover, others impacted by AI may have substantive
disagreements with the aims. The very success of AI may be part of its problems.
Just as the Industrial Revolution led to a large increase in living standards overall by
making possible the mass production of goods, that very same mass production has
led to a host of problems, including environmental problems, plunging some into
poverty, and increasing social inequality. Likewise, suppose AI could lead to vastly
increased capabilities of cheaply and quickly diagnosing future health across the
population. It would then become necessary to consider the implications of the
knowledge this unleashes and what beneﬁts it might bring. There are many other
possible examples of the problems of success.
Us and them, us or them Many different questions in AI ethics involve consider-
ation of how we interact with AI. There are a multitude of questions about how we
interact with the machines around us that utilise AI. There are diverse ﬁelds of study
regarding how humans interact with computers [17] and considerable work in
robotics regarding the interaction between humans and robots in various ﬁelds
[18]. These raise ﬁne-tuned questions about the impact of technology on the
human subject.
Other sets of questions are generated by considering more directly some of the
possible capacities of machines. Could AI develop consciousness or other levels of
sophistication such that we owed any duties to it? Could machines be moral beings
in any signiﬁcant sense, and could they be used to contribute to our moral behaviour,
can they be joint agents with us, and can a machine ever be responsible in a
signiﬁcant way for its decisions and actions? These require examination not just of
moral theory but also of the nature of the mind, of agency, responsibility, and
consciousness, all questions involving interdisciplinary input. The very development
of AI has in fact been linked to the development of work in areas such as cognitive
science and the philosophy of mind, which are highly relevant to addressing the
ethical questions that arise [19]. We consider these questions ahead, particularly in
Chaps. 8–11.
Control or chaos The question of control appears in various guises in addressing
safety and ethical issues in AI. Control issues are frequently the major point of
discussion but also often play a key role when other questions come to the fore. We

will return to them at many points in the book. Questions of control include the issue
of how humans, in general, can control extremely powerful AI to meet their purposes
and values. This is often known as the general question of value alignment. Indeed,
the term ‘value alignment’ is sometimes used almost synonymously with ‘AI ethics’.
The complexity, opacity, and power of much AI produce difﬁcult problems with
control for those creating and using AI. The use of AI by human beings to control
other human beings is also a pressing question, and this includes speciﬁc attempts to
control, together with more creeping issues of control arising from the increasing
entanglement of aspects of life with AI and technologies that use it. It is thus from the
very nature of AI itself, plus its production and application in various interconnected
technologies, which go to produce the many issues which fall under the general
rubric of the ‘control problem’.

Control of AI: Humans in the Loop
The question of our control of technology is nothing new. Failsafe devices and
other techniques such as dead man’s switches have been used to prevent
disastrous consequences when things go wrong, and the more powerful the
technology, the greater the capacity for catastrophe, the more such control is
needed.
One way of achieving control over technologies such as AI is to have a
‘human-in-the-loop’ [20]. This means, in outline, that a human being will
always be involved in the chain of decision making and action, or that a human
being will always be on hand to intervene in time if it seems as if something is
going wrong. This stresses the complex question of AI systems and the human
and organisational structures in which they are embedded [21]. Of course,
much depends upon the human being(s) in such a role.
In some cases, depending on the applications, human involvement may be
post hoc, for example, in reviewing automated decisions about welfare distri-
bution. In other cases, reaction to error needs to be immediate, such as in cases
of potential meltdown of a power plant or missile errors. The complexity and
lack of transparency of much AI may impose limits on the capacity of any
human-in-the-loop system to correct for error and disaster.

Summary
This section provides an introduction to some central concepts and values in AI
ethics. These are freedom and autonomy, transparency and explanation, responsi-
bility, transparency, justice and fairness, beneﬁcence and nonmaleﬁcence, privacy,
trust, sustainability, dignity, and solidarity. Case studies are used to illustrate each,
with exercises designed to highlight key issues, which will be explored in further

depth in later chapters. We examine why these concepts arise in relation to AI. The
intersections between these concepts and values are stressed.

The Rise of AI Ethics
Broad themes of recurring ethical issues and concepts are emerging from the analysis
of the many cases receiving attention [22]. It is important to consider not only the
details of these cases but also how they are analysed ethically to participate in current
debates while also considering how those debates are conducted. Our broader aim is
to consider how the ethical questions in AI are currently understood and tackled, and
whether there are ways of improving and advancing the speciﬁc contributions of
ethics.
This section presents an overview of central concepts in AI ethics, drawing
heavily from a review by Jobin et al. of AI ethics guidelines from around the
world (but, it is fair to say, these are predominantly from North America and Western
Europe) [23]. This review extracts and classiﬁes common themes recurring centrally
in discussions of AI ethics; there have been other projects also undertaking similar
tasks [24, 25]. For our introduction to these themes, this section presents examples of
cases, with indicators of some of the important ethical and conceptual questions that
we need to examine. The cases are described in outline, but interested readers can
research further details of relevant examples: the exercises invite you to draw out
further considerations and are designed to elicit some of the major themes that we
will later explore in more detail. Inevitably, many readers will have questions and
ideas that we do not have space to explore in this book.

with dementia Although in this book examples of AI are chosen from a range of
applications, many of the case studies refer to technology developed for, or applied
for, people living with dementia and elderly people. This is intentional because it can
help to present a picture of the many different kinds of technology that one
individual or group of people may experience and the many intertwined ethical
questions that may arise. I chose this topic ﬁrst because I have been working for
some years with a research group concerned with the provision of hospital care for
people living with dementia, based at the Geller Institute of Aging and Memory in
the University of West London. Second, because this is a growing demographic
worldwide, there are many preexisting and complex ethical, social, practical, and
medical questions concerning care and treatment, hence providing a challenging and
complex background against which to consider ethical issues in AI. Third, in
considering our use of AI, it is essential that we consider our humanity. People
living with dementia are a particularly vulnerable group whose humanity is often
threatened by the poor level of care they unfortunately may receive. There is
potential for great improvement, with possible contributions from technology, but
it is also vitally important that minute attention be paid to the humanity of this group
of individuals. Last, although at ﬁrst sight work on the day-to-day care of people
living with dementia seems a world away from the high-tech world of AI, I have
found numerous overlaps in the ethical and conceptual questions that need to be
addressed.

Ethical Issues or Technical Issues?
Hagendorf has analysed the ethical issues in AI which are receiving prominent
attention and suggests that the most visible questions are those which lend
themselves to being addressed using the tools of technical expertise [26]. The
attraction of focusing on such issues for organisations producing AI is appar-
ent, precisely because they are more likely to have the expertise to do
so. However, this does not mean that there are no further ethical, societal,
and cultural questions left to ask, nor that even in cases where technical
expertise is necessary, that only technical expertise is needed in understanding
what is at issue and in coming to some resolution of the question.
2.4.1
Freedom and Autonomy
Freedom and autonomy are frequently mentioned in relation to ethical questions in
AI. These closely related terms are concepts to which many will have some intuitive
response [27–29]. They are both concerned with our ability to act, think, and make
decisions. Hence, it should be readily apparent why they might play such a large part
in discussions of AI ethics, since AI is likewise ‘thinking’ and ‘making decisions’.
However, there is considerable complexity in how questions of freedom and auton-
omy might arise, how these concepts are understood, and the degree to which they
are valued.
The questions concerning freedom and autonomy in relation to AI are extremely
complex because one could readily assume that the whole point of using technology
was to increase one’s freedom and autonomy. Questions arise, however, about how
this is done, whose freedom and autonomy are increased, and any unintended
consequences.
Case study: Direction ﬁnders A simple example might be using a navigation aid
such as Google Maps to ﬁnd the fastest route to your destination or to work out what
time the rush hour is likely to ease off to plan when to make a journey.
However, not so fast. The Google Maps example is not quite so straightforward
for a number of reasons. Consider a popular route. If a thousand motorists all look at
roughly the same time to determine which is the fastest way to a certain destination,
and they all get the same route suggestion, then that route will quickly become
clogged with trafﬁc. Therefore, suggested routes given to some motorists may not be
the fastest, in order to prevent problems at a systemic level [30, pp. 101–111]. Is your
individual autonomy and freedom being limited or manipulated? Note that there
could be different responses to this.
This example follows from an intentional design element, but of course, there are
also examples where a problem arises not by design but by error. There are many
cases when the directions have been quite wrong but followed blindly by trusting
humans. Someone in the village where my brother lives frequently has motorists

turning up in her driveway, who proceed to insist that her humble cottage is a nearby
stately home that they are trying to visit. People who make such errors are frequently
ridiculed, but what does it say about humans in general, and how willing we are to
hand over our decision-making to a machine?
46

The Rise of AI Ethics
Consider too the experience individuals might have using automated directions
when walking. Many people have confessed to me that they follow instructions on
their phone to get to a destination in the city without really looking up at their
surroundings or having the slightest clue how they got there. This seems apparent
from observing how many people walk erratically along the street, nose in phone.
Have they increased their autonomy by the use of a direction ﬁnder, since they can
now concentrate on something else instead? Or is their autonomy decreased to the
extent that habitual use of a direction ﬁnder may mean that a person becomes
increasingly dependent on their smartphone? If they always do have a smartphone,
why would this matter? To answer these questions, we have to think further about
what we mean by autonomy, why we value it, and what else we value.
Question
A person may have reduced capacity to work out directions. Does this matter if we
now can rely on smartphones? Is it merely nostalgia to wish to retain the capacity to
read a paper map?
A person who habitually walks to destinations with the aid of this tech may also
know less about what their surroundings actually look like. They may have avoided
many occasions when they could have looked with recognition into the face of a
stranger walking towards them. They may have never found out that taking a route
that is 1 min longer would have given them a wonderful view or taken them past a
historic building, a convenient shop, or an unusual tree.
Question
Is this just a harmless by-product of walking along a street nose to phone? Does it
matter? Consider other possible examples.
‘Use it or lose it’ There have been some warnings that the use of direction ﬁnders
may erode our capacities to navigate our environment, and fears expressed that this
might even contribute to the loss of navigational abilities [31]. These are often an
early sign of the development of dementia. Dementia is a variable condition, or
rather, a group of conditions, but frequently one of the earliest abilities to be affected
is navigation. There is a great deal that is not known about dementia and its
aetiology, so it would be premature to make any conclusions, but it is worth
considering if AI might have such profound impacts. At the other end of our lifespan,
how might child development be affected?
Exercise 2
If you habitually use a direction ﬁnder, get a paper map, work out a route, and go out
without it.

2.4

(If my experience is anything to go by, as soon as you are spotted in the streets
gazing into a paper A to Z, helpful strangers will approach you to give directions and
to mock you for your apparent inability to use technology.)
‘The Knowledge’
London black cab drivers are famous for their chat, for their ready opinion on
any topic under the sun, and for ‘The Knowledge’. This requirement for taxi
drivers was introduced in 1865 and involves the capacity to navigate the streets
and major landmarks of London without the aid of a map and to learn the
fastest routes through the tangle of London’s roads. An old city, it does not
have the clear routes of those modern cities which are based upon a grid
system. It can take 3–4 years to acquire this knowledge and to pass the test. At
the time of writing, this requirement is still in place to be licensed as a taxi
driver by Transport for London [32].
Some scientiﬁc research indicates that London taxi drivers have an enlarged
posterior hippocampus compared to controls, indicating its role in spatial
navigation, and demonstrating local plastic change in the adult brain [33].
If our freedom and autonomy concern how we think, speak, and act, then there are
almost boundless possibilities to consider in relation to the use of AI. The direction
ﬁnder example relates to how we think, make decisions, and act. We will see many
examples later of ways in which AI technologies may affect human thought.
Exercise 3
It is hard not to admire those who have spent years travelling around London on
scooters learning The Knowledge. However, is this now just a waste of time, given
direction ﬁnders?
Compare and contrast the pluses and minuses of the old-fashioned way to using
new technologies.
Do any of the points you considered raise, or relate to, ethical questions?
Key Points Answering whether a certain value, such as autonomy, is increased or
threatened by AI will often require that we consider many aspects of the technology
in question, including its capacities and limitations; features included in the design
that may be there for different purposes, such as ironing out any unintended
consequences of use; and wider questions about the deployment of a piece of
technology and its occasional or habitual use by humans in context.
It should be apparent from this initial discussion that assessing AI by reference to
the values of autonomy and freedom will require deeper accounts of how these
values are understood. We will see in Chap. 9 that the questions relate closely to the
concept of a person.
Consideration of freedom and autonomy has also quickly led to examination of
other issues. In this example, these include questions about how we access and retain

information and knowledge, how we relate to our environments, and how technol-
ogy might impact information processing and even brain development.

2.4.2
Transparency and Explanation
Questions of transparency arise frequently in AI, often, as has already been men-
tioned, in relation to the ‘black box’ nature of much of the technology—the difﬁculty
of understanding precisely how results are produced [30]. Lack of transparency
means that it will be hard, or impossible, to provide an explanation of how the
technology works, and this in turn may mean that it is hard, or impossible, to provide
an explanation for why it is adopted.
There has been considerable attention to these issues, including statements by
professional bodies [34] and regulatory action, as well as debate over how European
Union regulations restrict the use of automated decision-making involving those
algorithms which are used for any decision-making that ‘signiﬁcantly affects’
individuals. This then in effect results in a ‘right to an explanation’ in certain
circumstances (for instance, in decisions involving the allocation of public
resources) [35]. However, providing such an explanation may be far from easy. It
is readily apparent that what might count as an explanation of the underlying
computing that works well for computer scientists with expertise in these areas
will likely be less than satisfactory, even bafﬂing, to many [36]. Careful attention
needs to be paid to the question of what even counts as a useful and workable
explanation that does what is needed in different circumstances [37]. Attempts are
being made to ﬁnd solutions to the problem of providing explanations that increase
transparency. There are different approaches to explanations, with hope for progress
in this area by using contrastive explanations, which aim to show why the results are
not different, and counterfactual explanations, which aim to show how the results
could be changed, by adjusting elements of the algorithm (if-then explanations)
[38]. Counterfactual explanations could be used without the need to give an account
of the technical details of how an algorithm worked, that is, without looking inside
the black box [39]. Fears have also been raised that too much focus on transparency
and the right to an explanation may distract from other substantial ethical issues and
harms from algorithms [36]. It has also been argued that the technological challenges
here may hold AI to a higher standard than that to which ordinary human beings are
held, noting that there are limits to the amount of explanation for decisions which is
reasonable to require, or indeed, which it is possible to give [40].
A useful analysis of types of transparency and of a range of challenges is provided
by Adrian Weller [41]. He emphasises the points made by others that we need to
think carefully about the goal of transparency if we are to avoid unintended harmful
consequences. Demands for transparency can be used to game a system and may
threaten other values such as privacy, as well as having efﬁciency costs. Transpar-
ency is not necessarily an end in itself, and considering the need for transparency on
different occasions is necessary to determine what precisely is needed; for example,

this may be to enable audit of a system by an expert or to enable a user of a system to
be given the right to question a decision. It is useful to consider the goals of
transparency for different parties: for users, for society more broadly, and for
deployers. These may be at odds: for example, transparency may lead to trust that
keeps a user using a system to the beneﬁt of the deployer.

Case study: Machine learning in image classiﬁcation for diagnostics One of the
most successful and widely adopted uses of machine learning is in image recognition
to support diagnosis from medical imaging such as MRI scans. Currently, much
research indicates that ML in combination with human experts produces better
results than either alone. ML can detect aspects of an image that a human is unable
to detect. However, ML may sometimes make errors that no human would ever
make. There are also issues of transparency because it may be hard or impossible to
know precisely how the ML produced its results.
Exercise 4
In a medical context, how important is it for a healthcare practitioner to know
precisely how ML produced its diagnosis of a medical image? What are the reasons
for your answer? How important is it to the patients that their healthcare practitioner
can provide an explanation of how the machine came to its results, and why?
Consider the importance of safety and of trust in a medical context.
Patients are often happy to use drugs that can be demonstrated to have a good
standard of safety and efﬁcacy, even if the medical profession does not understand
very well how they work. Do we expect higher standards of AI than of other
examples of technology? If so, are we right to do so?
You may feel you don’t have enough understanding of the speciﬁc context to
address this question: consider what else you might need to know, and consider how
this very issue with gaps in knowledge might impact a patient and their need or
desire for transparency.
Key Points There are complex technical issues involved in the question of trans-
parency. A great deal of technical work is underway to attempt to provide as much
explanation as possible. It is also recognised that explanation is relative to who
requires the explanation. Something easy for an expert in machine learning to
comprehend may not function as a usable explanation to another person. We should
also see that explanation is a key part of moral and professional accountability and
indicates the ethical issue of what we owe each other in a particular context.
Transparency concerns not only technical issues in AI but also issues of ownership
and commercial conﬁdence.
2.4.3
Justice and Fairness
Justice and fairness are central concepts to ethics with strong political, social, and
legal aspects. They are also strongly afﬁrmed, yet with a range of different precise

interpretations. Questions of justice and fairness have received considerable atten-
tion in politics, law, and political philosophy, and the debates in these areas are
recurring again in AI [42]. For example, some accounts of fairness stress equality of
opportunity, some stress equality of outcome, and some stress minimising the
disadvantage to the worst off [43]. Strong notions of fairness seem to arise in
small children from very early on in their development. However, apart from their
widespread relevance in society, there are many reasons why AI in particular may
give rise to questions of justice and fairness, and there is considerable attention to
this ﬁeld [44]. Indeed, some of these relate to questions of transparency and
explanation. To introduce this question, let us look at a well-known example that
concerns the justice system itself, the COMPAS algorithm.
50
2
The Rise of AI Ethics
Case study: COMPAS (Correctional Offender Management Proﬁling for Alterna-
tive Sanctions) is a software produced by the company Northpointe and widely used
across the USA to generate decisions in case management in criminal justice. It
generates risk scores for future behaviour such as recidivism. A widely publicised
study by ProPublica in 2016 found that the scores generated were biased against
black individuals, being more likely to falsely score them as likely to reoffend than
whites [45]. Northpointe disputed these ﬁndings [46]. Subsequent studies have
examined the accuracy of such predictions compared to judgements by humans
and the possibility of producing results free from bias concerning demographic
factors such as race and gender on accuracy, with some casting doubt on the
ProPublica study [47–49].
Whatever the accuracy of this particular algorithm, the case raises critically
important questions about fairness and bias in the use of such algorithms, especially
in critical issues such as criminal justice and especially in relation to vital issues such
as racial prejudice. The questions raised include the ways in which algorithms may
reproduce or even magnify the prejudices of the past by working on historical data
that reﬂects prior biases. Discussions have included a detailed examination of the
technical details of the algorithms and data analysis. Note how an understanding of
the ethical questions builds upon an understanding of the past history of race
relations in the USA, especially in relation to criminal justice and corrections.
This also indicates the important point that the manner in which we categorise the
world and how we label categories have meaning and signiﬁcance with personal and
political implications [50]. Attention has been given to issues of race and gender
[51], and doubtless other potential instances of unfairness and bias merit attention.
Hence, tackling the issue of bias requires careful thought [52, 53]. This will also
include underlying philosophical questions in epistemology and metaphysics regard-
ing how we gain knowledge of the world and how we conceptualise and categorise
the world. On one simple approach to the matter, tackling bias in algorithms may
require ensuring that we have unbiased data and unbiased models and use a ‘neutral’
and true picture of the world. However, the way such goals are expressed may not
even be conceptually coherent, and there are great challenges, including recognising
our own shortcomings and prejudices [54]. Addressing bias in a system requires that

we look for it, and to do this, we must use categories; however, by doing so, we may
be including a way of seeing the world that contains its own injustices [52].
2.4
Ethical Questions in AI Currently Receiving Attention
51
Note too now this raises questions of epistemology: how algorithms present
knowledge claims to us, and in particular, expectations that the future will be like
the past. Furthermore, the question of transparency was raised, especially as the
algorithm was propriety software owned by a private company.
Exercise 5
Consider: there is a particular tension here between the use of prediction and
attitudes towards human beings and towards the justice system. In theory, ‘correc-
tional’ facilities are meant to both punish and to reform; that is why they are called
‘correctional’. We hold out hope for the transformation of character, hoping that an
offender’s future will not be like their past. However, does something like the
COMPAS algorithm treat human beings more like objects in the physical universe
whose future can be predicted mathematically from the past?
This question raises a foretaste of some central issues in AI ethics that will be
discussed throughout the book: whether our use of AI may subtly skew some of the
ﬁner points of our moral thinking.
Human and machine agency Another dimension of justice, fairness, and agency
that arises from such a case is the very question of using a machine to make certain
important decisions that affect the course of people’s lives. This is a question of a
different order from the speciﬁcs of whether the COMPAS algorithm was biased in
its judgements. Some may argue that questions of justice should be determined by
other human beings, whether these be ‘a jury of my peers’, a judge, or a magistrate.
The questions of justice and fairness are hence linked to questions of agency and of
the replacement of humans by machines.
Question
If there was no difference in the accuracy of the outcome, would it matter to you if
you were judged by a machine or by a human? Why or why not?
Key Points Questions of justice and fairness can arise from the technical aspects of
AI, from its use of data, from the surrounding ethical, historical, and societal context,
as well as from the very question of the use of AI rather than reliance on humans to
make certain decisions. Determining the nature of any injustice or bias may be a
complex technical issue as well as one involving sensitive ethical and political
debates.
2.4.4
Beneﬁcence/Nonmaleﬁcence
Beneﬁcence aims for AI to produce beneﬁt, or good; nonmaleﬁcence for it not to
produce harm. These are not the same and come apart signiﬁcantly in many contexts.
Indeed, a stress on beneﬁcence, or on nonmaleﬁcence, is behind some of the
differences in accounts of fairness mentioned in the last section. It is very common

for codes and guidance to call for AI to provide as much beneﬁt as possible. This is at
once an obvious and basic aim, yet incredibly vague. For who is to beneﬁt, and how
is beneﬁt to be understood and assessed? Given the scepticism about ethics that we
have already noted, one might also suspect that advocating that AI is used to beneﬁt
as many as possible is little different from a sales pitch for research and development
and adoption of AI. Recall how we have already seen that the interests of those
deploying AI for transparency may be at odds with users.
52
2
The Rise of AI Ethics
Let us consider one example to illustrate some complexities. Note of course that a
different choice of example would doubtless have produced some different issues,
especially given how broad the concepts of beneﬁt and harm are.
A case study The EDoN project is a research project for the Early Detection of
Neurodegenerative diseases (edon-initiative.org). It aims to tackle diseases such as
dementia, which are increasing worldwide as the global population ages, and which
present major challenges for individuals, for their families and carers, as well as for
society. Currently, there is still much unknown about the various forms of dementia
and, indeed, much unknown about the brain and cognition, and unfortunately, there
is little to hand in the way of treatment or effective preventive measures. Moves to
treat and prevent these neurodegenerative diseases are thus needed. The EDoN
project involves experts in digital technology, data science, and neurodegenerative
diseases to develop a digital tool for the early detection of dementia-causing
diseases, including in those individuals who have no obvious signs of dementia.
Some hope to be able to detect the origins of dementia decades before the ﬁrst signs
[55]. AI and digital technologies are an essential part of these efforts.
Dementia is a major issue for individuals living with dementia, their families and
care providers, the health and social care systems, and the economy in general.
Hence, ﬁnding ways to further our understanding of the condition and how to treat
and prevent it would promise great beneﬁt.
Exercise 6
Consider the beneﬁts and any possible downsides of the early detection of dementia,
for individuals, for their families, and for health providers, and for society overall.
Are there any other groups you might also want to consider?
In doing so, note the questions you have to which you don’t have the answers, and
where you would go to ﬁnd them.
Consider what it might mean to detect dementia decades before the ﬁrst signs.
Might this mean that we change our ideas of what a disease or health condition is?
Consider what it is to have knowledge of different types. What might it mean for a
scientist to have knowledge of how to diagnose dementia before the ﬁrst signs? What
might it mean for a health provider to be able to perform such a diagnosis? And to an
individual to be given this diagnosis?
The ethical questions of AI are often a matter of scale and speed. Consider if more
knowledge is always an untainted good.

2.4
Ethical Questions in AI Currently Receiving Attention
53
Key Points As before, the particular example we used showed complexities in
assessing the beneﬁts and the necessity of addressing assumptions about the beneﬁts
of greater knowledge.
We also saw the complexity of assessing beneﬁts from the point of view of
different individuals and groups.
2.4.5
Responsibility
Responsibility is a complex topic, with different aspects of responsibility, including
causal, moral, and legal. It relates closely to notions of agency and to descriptions of
how situations occurred, what should happen in the future, and who should do what.
Questions of responsibility arise in relation to AI for many reasons [56–61]. The
sheer complexity of the technology, the number of people and organisations
involved in its production and implementation, and its integration into systems
often leave us with vexed questions about attribution of responsibility and how it
may be distributed throughout a system [62]. The problem of transparency creates
more problems of responsibility, and questions of distribution of agency between
machines and humans create more still. Furthermore, the swift pace of change of
technology and its use and integration into society are leading to debate and
differences of opinion about the nature and distribution of responsibility.
Case study: Tay the racist chatbot This is a well-known example of AI Gone Bad.
Tay was a short-lived bot released onto Twitter by Microsoft on March 23, 2016.
Tay was designed to appear to be a teenage girl responding to others in conversation.
Some would say Tay—or ‘she’—did precisely that, or at any rate, that Tay behaved
exactly like some people behave on Twitter, and precisely how some teenagers
behave in real life. In response to and in mimicry of what ‘she’ had learned, Tay was
quickly putting out tweets such as ‘I hate feminists and they should all die and burn
in hell’ as well as tweets using racial and antisemitic slurs and praising Hitler. The
account was suspended within 16 h [63].
Astute readers may have noticed that tweets suggesting particular groups or
individuals should burn in hell and so on and so forth are somewhat common on
Twitter. One might have thought someone at Microsoft would have anticipated this
debacle [64]. In this example, there are an entire cast of actors who could each be
attributed some responsibility. Note that responsibility covers both responsibilities
for causing or contributing to a situation and for addressing it.
Those involved in some way include the team at Microsoft who produced Tay;
those responsible for deciding to launch Tay; those at Microsoft responsible for the
decision to take Tay down; the Twitter users with whom Tay interacted; those
responsible for Twitter policy on offensive tweets and offensive accounts; those
who viewed or reported Tay’s tweets; and legislators responsible for any laws
governing language designed to provoke hate or incite violence. Consider if you

wish to add any more to the list. Note how almost anybody in the world who has
access to the Internet could play some part, no matter how small.

Exercise 7
Consider the role and possible responsibilities for each of these parties (and any
others you have thought of).
Note how Tay is often described as if possessing agency. Tay is described as
‘she’, even though ‘she’ is simply a piece of software. Consider if this affects how
we might think and feel about responsibility.
Key Points This case is not simply an example of individual failure of one piece of
software. It demonstrates how the technologies we use to communicate shape
interactions and language. The phenomenon of hateful and abusive language online
and debates about how to deal with this are part of much larger social, cultural, and
political conversations around technologies and their wider impact.
What might be an interesting programming task in natural language processing
(NLP) presenting challenges in both software and in understanding the formal
aspects of language to one person is replete with meaning and references to some
of the most appalling episodes of human history and some of the most damaging
behaviours towards individuals and groups of people.
Note also the intersection of technical, social, governance, and regulatory factors
in assigning responsibility.
2.4.6
Privacy
Questions of privacy arise in relation to AI for many reasons related to software,
hardware, and attitudes towards technology. The increase in processing capacity that
has enabled the analysis of vast amounts of personal data, together with the capacity
to make predictions, is one source of concern, especially given the necessary use by
much AI of vast amounts of data. The capacity of technology to monitor the
environment and to collect personal data has increased, for example, through wear-
ables, computer vision, and the use of everyday technology such as smartphones; the
ﬂip side of privacy is surveillance by others. Large changes in our use of technology
are also impacting attitudes towards privacy, which are often very complex [65–69].
Case study: Surveillance of people living with dementia Dementia is a variable
and progressive set of conditions, so symptoms exhibited by individuals vary, but
wandering and disorientation in time and space are common. There are often realistic
fears that a person living with dementia may wander away from the safety of home,
care institution, or hospital and into danger. Locking doors to prevent this is
common, but surveillance by cameras and motion detection devices with facial
recognition software may be used in preference. This may enable someone to walk
more freely, for example, into a garden or outdoor area. Tracking devices may also
be used to enable swift location of the person if they wander further

[70]. Surveillance via the Internet of things is also being suggested for people living
with dementia to monitor daily activities [71]. Other reasons for surveillance include
concern about falls or other medical events and accidents caused by forgetfulness.
2.4
Ethical Questions in AI Currently Receiving Attention
55
Exercise 8
How would you assess the privacy concerns about such surveillance for people
living with dementia? What is the relevance of their medical condition to the use of
such surveillance? Is it relevant to consider privacy issues, or are these overridden by
more important concerns? In considering these questions, bear in mind that dementia
is a very variable condition and a progressive disease. Are there any concerns about
privacy from surveillance by technologies any different from constant monitoring by
a human companion?
Consider the issue of privacy from the point of view of those whose personal
space is being surveilled and from the point of view of those gaining knowledge
about the minutiae of someone’s life. How do the issues of consent and awareness of
such surveillance shape your response?
Consider the context of the general increase in surveillance in everyday life, for
example, from CCTV, location data through smartphone use, and the routine
collection of personal data online and elsewhere. Does this change your attitude
at all?
Key Points Note that epistemology is again an issue. The sheer increase in infor-
mation and data of different sorts creates ethical issues but also potentially shifts our
attitudes towards the very issue that is in question. Relationships between people are
directly at issue: loss of privacy for one party is gain of information for another. This
is complicated by the various relationships we have with different people and the
privacy norms of time, place, social status, and social context. The increases in
technological capacity for collecting and interpreting information may represent a
potential qualitative shift in how we understand privacy. The embedding of such
technologies into everyday life and infrastructure may both increase our awareness
of invasions of privacy, while we also become accustomed to it.
2.4.7
Trust
Trust concerns the nature and quality of a relationship between two and more people
or groups [72]. Trust may refer to a feeling state and/or to a level of epistemic
conﬁdence in the probity and reliability of a group or individual and/or the reliability
and safety of technology. Trust issues may arise in AI because of its complexity and
the level of expertise and knowledge needed fully to understand both discrete
instances of the technology and the wider systems of technology and production in
which it is embedded [73, 74]. The newness of the technology, speed of develop-
ment, behaviour of corporations, ﬁnancial interests, well-publicised warnings
and portents of doom, failed promises, and everyday glitches in the use of software
and devices may all undermine trust. The explicit attempt by corporations and

governments to ascertain trust in AI may also further cause suspicion—why are they
so keen for us to trust it? [75, 76].
56
2
The Rise of AI Ethics
Furthermore, some of the ways in which AI operates create speciﬁc issues with
trust. The replacement of human decision-making and thought by machines in itself
raises complex issues of trust, with one major question being, in a nutshell, whether
exchanging a trusted human being with a machine is a fair like-for-like swap. The
possibility of action-at-a-distance afforded by much AI technology, the embedded
and sometimes hidden nature of the technologies, the lack of transparency, the
frequently inescapable necessity to use technologies which include AI, and the
possibilities of manipulation by such technology are all also liable to impact trust,
although precisely how, it is hard to say, since habituation to technology may lead
both to assumed trust and growing suspicions.
Case study: Care robots for elderly individuals Considerable attention is being
given to the development of care robots for the growing population of elderly people.
These robots could provide stimulation and companionship and perform certain
tasks, such as reminders that medication needs to be taken and provision of the
correct medications at the correct time. Robots may have friendly human-like
features and voices designed to inspire trust [77].
Exercise 9
Outline the different trust issues that arise with the use of such robots. Consider the
relationships and lines of trust involved—who has to trust whom, and why? How
might trust be attained, and what might threaten it?
Could trust be unearned? Might the provision of human-like features in a robot
create misplaced trust?
Consider the speciﬁc issue of the provision of medication. What are the trust
issues present here? Suppose a robot could address concerns that a person had
around their medication by answering questions concerning its purpose and side
effects. Would this be a good way of attaining trust? Are there any reasons why a
robot might be more trustworthy than hiring human caregivers? Is lack of trust a
good default position?
Key Points Trust is one of the many areas where comparison between humans and
AI is very pertinent. It is entirely possible with both humans and AI that trust is
misplaced. It is a complex phenomenon that cannot be reduced to a simple formula.
Trust in technology may pertain to factors such as its functionality, reliability, and
safety but also to its appearance, marketing, and imagined qualities.
In many ways, trust functions as an umbrella term in ethics signalling a large set
of questions, i.e. technical, societal, and individual.

2.4

2.4.8
Sustainability
Why is sustainability a particular issue in AI? Isn’t it just something we are always
concerned with? It will be obvious that questions of sustainability in AI arise from
the production of hardware, but they also arise from the operation of software [60].
Case study: The computational power of AI and energy use Data centres are
among the world’s largest consumers of electricity. The carbon footprint of the
computational infrastructure of the world is set to greatly exceed that of the aviation
industry [78]. Much of this computational power is generated from technology
which has been embedded into our lives. The particular demands of processing
power of AI contribute to this and are receiving attention. Early research indicates
that the carbon footprint of natural language processing (NLP) models is extremely
high [79]. This indicates that increases in speed, accuracy, and other improvements
to AI may come at a high environmental cost. The case of Timnit Gebru’s departure
from Google is mentioned in Chap. 1. The paper she had been working on also
discussed the energy costs of language processing models [80].
Question
You have probably routinely been told that it is better to read an email or document
than to print it out. However, do you know precisely how such calculations
are made?
The task of calculating the beneﬁts to be gained from the increased processing
power and capabilities of a particular NLP model and the energy use it entails will be
complex and require specialised knowledge. (Trust in claims of environmental
standards is thus an issue.)
A feature of technology that makes this a particular issue is its distributed nature,
meaning that much of the use of resources is hidden from view. Sustainability is also
an issue in terms of the human beings contributing to—or exploited by—the
production of AI. This includes not just those workers extracting the raw materials
needed and the workers making and assembling the products but also the remote
workers involved in the creation of ‘artiﬁcial’ intelligence such as content modera-
tors and those labelling data.
Ethical issues arise in relation to sustainability in questions such as the distribu-
tion of resources and the burden of achieving sustainability between individuals,
groups, and across geographical regions. It also arises at a fundamental level
concerning the quality of life for humans and what is needed to achieve a certain
quality of life. This includes the major ethical question of the population size [78].
Tracing the convoluted supply chains, the intricacies of the production process,
and the materials and human beings involved vividly demonstrates how we must
bear in mind the complexity and global reach of AI when we consider all ethical
issues. To do justice to these questions of sustainability, however, requires consid-
erable specialisation and empirical knowledge, which is beyond the scope of
this book.

58
2
The Rise of AI Ethics
Key Points Many sustainability issues in AI have received scant attention because
of the nature of much AI, that its precise operations are hidden from the end user. A
lesson to learn is that this means that other ethical issues may also be hidden from
us. Questions of transparency in the operation of technology are revealed to extend
far beyond the more technical questions of the transparency of machine learning
algorithms but to the transparency of the wider social, economic, and political
systems into which AI is embedded.
Relevance to questions of justice, fairness, and the nature and distribution of
beneﬁts and burdens should be apparent, showing yet more interrelations between
different ethical questions.
The question of time, of progress, and of infrastructure also arises, since the
development of technology has led to entrenched dependence on that very technol-
ogy, so that it is hard to extricate ourselves and hard to address.
2.4.9
Dignity
Dignity is frequently mentioned in ethics guidance concerning AI and is an inter-
esting, complex example of an ethical concept that can be highly charged yet hard to
articulate. It’s a term often applied to contexts such as the practice of medicine, the
treatment of prisoners, and the conditions of the most vulnerable in society [81]. It’s
also an especially complex question to consider in relation to AI, since dignity seems
to have a role precisely in stressing something rather ineffable about the valuable
qualities of a human being. Indeed, although it may be a background issue, there are
noticeably fewer papers in AI ethics directly discussing dignity than other concepts,
such as transparency and privacy. Let us consider one complex and nuanced case
where technology may be presented as enabling dignity but where questions may
nonetheless arise.
Case study: Remote assistance for elderly individuals The technology in ques-
tion involves a mix of computing and human intervention, an app designed to watch
over isolated individuals such as the elderly or those living with dementia by care.
coach [82]. A human-powered avatar of a cuddly looking dog on a tablet ‘wakes up’
at regular intervals and interacts with the person, reminds them of appointments,
interacts by chatting and reading poetry, and issues alerts for any episodes such as
falls. The article referenced describes the avatar responding to an elderly man that he
loves him. The app can enable an elderly person to remain at home without going
into a care facility for longer, hence retaining independence. The app has been sold
and used in the USA. The avatar is operated remotely, generally by someone
hundreds or thousands of miles away, for example, in Latin America or the
Philippines.

2.4
Ethical Questions in AI Currently Receiving Attention
59
Exercise 10
Make the strongest case you can for the claim that such an app helps to enhance the
dignity of socially isolated individuals who need some assistance, and then consider
arguments against. How do you incorporate the signiﬁcance of cultural, social, and
economic factors? Consider the kinds of situations that might lead to the isolation of
the individuals who make use of such an app. Think about the role of the employees
who work through the avatars.
Does it make a difference if the person using the app is aware that the dog is not
actually talking to them but is an avatar operated by a person in another country? Are
there any other factors that this example brought to mind as relevant to assessing
dignity? You may wish to read more about this app before considering your
response, but this is not necessary.
This case study has many similarities to the examples discussed under privacy.
Does this particular example raise any new issues or new angles on the question of
privacy?
Key Points Dignity is such a complex issue that it is always going to be essential to
consider the impact on dignity of technology from a range of angles, including the
impact on dignity of failure to use technology and any alternatives, including the
historical reasons for the situation at hand.
It is a concept that forces us to look not simply at the details of technology but at
the entire issue of the use of technology in the place of human relationships.
2.4.10
Solidarity
The values of autonomy and freedom can be applied to groups and, of course, to the
population as a whole but are typically used to describe and defend the interests of
individuals. Likewise, for values such as privacy. The value of solidarity, in contrast,
speaks to responsibility and concern for others, especially those less advantaged than
ourselves [83]. There are overlaps with the value of beneﬁcence and conceptions of
justice.
Case study: Technology to equalise access to dementia diagnosis An app
designed by a group of medical students at the University College London aims to
equalise access to dementia diagnosis, particularly in certain demographic groups.
Many people remain undiagnosed, and rates of diagnosis are known to differ
between different ethnic groups. Mindstep4dementia is an app currently under
development that includes brain-training exercises and collects data that can indicate
early signs of the condition [84]. At the time of writing, there are some preliminary
validation results [85]. Since it is app-based and permits remote data gathering, it can
be used directly in the community without needing access to the clinic, and the
potential exists for widening access. Members of ethnic minority groups have been
encouraged to use the app [86]. A question may arise as to any obligations to

participate in medical research that has wider beneﬁts for society, even if it may not
beneﬁt oneself [87].
60

The Rise of AI Ethics
Exercise 11
Consider the ethical issues involved in the development of this app from the point of
view of solidarity. What aspects of the technology help to facilitate solidarity? Are
there any issues relating to solidarity that have been overlooked? Consider the
background reasons for the problems that the technology is hoping to address.
This example also demonstrates another issue: technology in development. Are
those using the app currently clear beneﬁciaries, or are they contributing to its
development for the sake of others who will beneﬁt in the future while gaining no
direct personal beneﬁt? How does this relate to the value of solidarity?
Consider relevant points from previous cases in developing your responses.
Key Points As ever, the value of solidarity intersects with many of the other values
at issue in AI ethics. Certain features of technology can enable wider distribution and
access. However, these can be a two-edged sword. Assessment of need also should
consider the potential downside of widened use, the reasons for the problem under
issue, and the suitability of technology to address issues. Solidarity is more than
beneﬁcence or welfare but also implies a certain reciprocity. The relationships and
involvement of the communities in question in development and application are
important.
2.5
A Brief History of AI Ethics
Summary
Historical precedent can provide useful insights when addressing current ethical
questions. A selective overview of historical concerns about relevant technologies is
given, looking at the history of robotics and myths about robots, including the
Uncanny Valley; concerns with writing as a technology; machinery, including the
Luddites; data; and computing.
2.5.1
Why Consider History?
A full history of ethical concerns about AI would be worthy of study in its own right,
but why mention history in a book on contemporary and future ethical issues?
Looking to history can enrich ethical thinking in a number of ways. In approaching
AI ethics, we need to consider not just the bare technology and its technical details
but also how it is seen and understood and how reactions to technology ﬁt into a
wider social and cultural context. Examples of imagined technologies from many
centuries ago may be an especially rich source for considering how fears and hopes
may be projected onto current technology and in cases where the technology had not

yet actually been developed. There are myths about robots from around the world,
from times long before robots were anywhere close to being possible.
2.5
A Brief History of AI Ethics
61
Any history will be written from a particular perspective and will show certain
values and assumptions, and we are likely to project our own assumptions onto the
past. To illustrate, as someone born and brought up in Britain, I am probably more
likely to bring to mind key British ﬁgures from the history of science and technol-
ogy, such as Newton, Darwin, and Turing. This dawned on me graphically a few
years back in a museum in Paris, where an entire room was devoted to a mural
depicting prominent scientists in history, most of whom were French. Of course!
However, utility can still be found in the imaginative contemplation of human
response in different times and places. This section gives a ﬂavour of some relevant
history, not to provide a comprehensive overview, but to indicate some ways its
consideration could be useful for enriching a dialogue about ethics.
Past, present, and future A contemplation of the past may be especially useful for
those obsessed with the present and the future. History presses us to think of how
cultures, practices, and ideas change over time, so it is a counterweight to the danger
of imagining that we now, ﬁnally, have the answers. This can be a danger if we allow
ourselves to be entranced by ideas of technological and societal progress. Such a
viewpoint does seem to be common, if only implicitly. It is common, especially
perhaps post the Enlightenment, to think we have now thrown off superstition, we
have abandoned metaphysical and religious myth about human beings and our place
in the world, and, armed only with science and technology, we can march unfettered
into the future. It is easy to imagine that people in the past were somehow less clever
than us, even if this belief seems slightly silly as soon as it’s pointed out. The trope of
progress is particularly strong in many of the claims about AI, especially when
combined with claims of great power, which again are often made. It is common to
read claims that issues that have long perplexed humanity, numerous practical
problems, and many difﬁcult areas of research are now going to be solved at a
stroke with the use of this powerful new tool of AI.
There is nothing new under the sun, or so said King Solomon. Much of the story
of the past gets lost, especially in a climate where some stress the novelty of
AI. There are even technological reasons for this: books that are available only in
hard copy may simply be ignored in favour of online texts. It is valuable to recall and
realise that AI ethics is part of a continuing narrative of concerns.
A guide to the present Past examples of concerns about technology can alert us to
differences of approach but often too of commonalities in human response and
experience. In addition to myth and legend and responses to primitive or prototype
technologies, there are many real cases to study concerning the implementation of
technology and often of calamities from which lessons might be learned. We may
recognise certain concerns with AI as having forerunners, which can help to shape
our understanding of what these concerns are and how they originate. How we think
about ethical issues will depend in part upon the examples and case studies that come

to mind and the nuances of how an issue is ﬂeshed out. We may ﬁnd that we are
overlooking aspects by focusing solely on the present topics of discussion.
62
2
The Rise of AI Ethics
Power A history of ethics will also show us something of responses to concerns
about technology, who raises these, how concerns are taken note of, by whom, and
what the outcomes are. This sets the scene into which contemporary concerns about
AI ethics have arisen but should also alert us to questions of social and political
power and especially to how technologies enable such power to be wielded. Study-
ing and thinking about such lessons from history can make us reﬂect on how we
formulate and understand ethical questions ourselves, how we look around for
solutions, and what power dynamics and what forces and accidents of history are
present.
Key events and lasting responses The history of concerns about technology and
ethics in other areas is frequently shaped by key events and often by particular
disasters and the responses to them, which might include changes in law, regulation,
and societal attitude with lasting effects. It may be that the circumstances of
particular disasters formed precedents in ways that may be helpful to a greater or
lesser extent in understanding and tackling later issues. For example, in medical
ethics, the Nuremburg doctors’ trial followed the abuses by Nazi doctors in the
Second World War [88]. This has been of critical importance in how medical ethics
developed worldwide up until the present day, although much has developed since
and it is by no means the only factor. Forcing human beings into extreme, cruel
medical experiments, which resulted in unimaginable suffering and death, has led to
an insistence on informed consent and assertion of the key value of individual patient
autonomy. Autonomy is likewise, as we have seen, an important value in AI ethics.
How we think about autonomy in AI may well be impacted in some ways by how we
think of it in medicine.
However, discerning what can be learned from different cases is a complex
matter. There will be variations in how key events shape developments in different
places, attributable to a complex of factors including cultural and political issues. For
example, biomedical ethics in Germany has developed in somewhat different ways
from other surrounding nations, with particularly stringent rules against human
experimentation, including embryo research, in the wake of the extreme excesses
of the Nazis [89].
The history of technological calamities indicates that certain characteristics may
recur. For instance, if we examine major engineering disasters, a common thread is
breakdowns in communication. This was one of the factors leading to the Space
Shuttle Challenger disaster in 1986, where failures to get the right information to the
right people on time led to catastrophic failure [90]. The Space Shuttle Columbia
disaster in 2003 sadly suggests that certain lessons were not learned [91]. If we can
learn anything from history, it is that we fail to learn from history.
Moral panics and important lessons Some of the fears around new technological
possibilities can come to seem comical. There were fears that telephones could be
used to communicate with the dead, for example. I myself, like millions of other

children, was given dire warnings that watching too much television would give me
square eyes. (Why square, given that TV sets were roughly rectangular, was never
explained.)
2.5
A Brief History of AI Ethics
63
In AI ethics, certain cases and issues have received prominent attention. Note that
these may then help to shape the direction of regulation and the focus of attention of
concern, debate, and research but that what cases become prominent and receive the
most attention and response will be driven by local concerns, power, the media,
contemporary preoccupations, and sometimes happenstance, such as what else was
in the news at the time. Note too that it is less often the case that good practice
receives any attention. This may mean that if ethics develops in response to
prominent disasters, this may skew our reactions in suboptimal ways.
The COVID-19 Pandemic and Its Potential Impact on the History
of Medical Ethics and AI Ethics
Any history of the COVID-19 pandemic will surely include the input of
technologies, not just medical technologies such as drugs and vaccines, but
the technologies of AI. As soon as the pandemic began, work was underway
examining the impact of technologies [5]. Any histories written are likely to
diverge from each other, especially as one issue on which many have
expressed concern is how divided society has become.
There is an intertwining of issues here, with questions of medical ethics,
public health ethics (which differs in certain key respects from clinical medical
ethics applied to individual patients), media ethics, and ethical issues in
technologies such as tracking and vaccine passports, all coalesce. The issue
of public health was intertwined with questions of information trustworthiness
and veracity, and these with questions about the use of artiﬁcial technologies
such as track-and-trace apps for contact tracing.
Many have also observed that without the technologies allowing remote
working for many ofﬁce workers, and online ordering, the lockdowns could
not have occurred in the ways that they did.
Exercise 12
From your own background knowledge, consider some of the different viewpoints
and values that came into play during the pandemic and the contribution and role of
technology in general and of AI in particular in the response to the pandemic and
debates concerning its handling.

2.5.2
Playing with Fire: Historical Concerns About
Technologies
Concerns about the power of technologies are probably as old as those about
technology itself. It’s hard not to imagine that early humans were well aware of
the potential of ﬁre to ward away wild beasts, for warmth, and for cooking, on the
one hand and, on the other hand, its potential for hazard to life and limb and for
behaving like, well, wildﬁre. The draw of the ﬂame captures us but eternally reminds
us of its power.
Robots No work on AI ethics would be complete without mentioning the many
myths and stories about robots from around the world that have recurred from
ancient history to the present [92, 93]. It perhaps tells us something about the
resonance for human beings of the idea that brute matter might become somehow
like us. Historians have described an incredible number of such accounts, including
both myth and actual technologies. In some myths, animation arises by some
magical or godly power, such as breathing life into the earth, but many accounts
are of the contrivance of automata by purely technological means, made out of a
variety of substances and sometimes include a full range of internal parts. Automata
were generally designed or imagined either for labour, including military or security
purposes, for sex, or for entertainment. Somewhat similar to today’s robots, it seems.
Many such accounts are to be found in ancient Greece and Rome but also
elsewhere. For example, a Chinese story set the Ming dynasty in the tenth century
BCE describes a man-made man that is introduced to King Mu, who is delighted
until the artiﬁcial man takes somewhat of an interest in the king’s concubines. It is
then revealed to be an entirely constructed artiﬁce [93]. Unnerving stories of being
fooled by the lifelike nature of such automata are common and persist today in one of
the major ethical questions of whether humans may be fooled by humanoid robots
and whether a humanoid robot could ever be a legitimate substitute for a human
relationship, as well as in the concept of the ‘Uncanny Valley’ proposed by the
Japanese roboticist Mori to describe the feeling of encountering a robot or automata
that is close enough to being realistic, yet just slightly unconvincing enough, to
produce that creepy feeling of weirdness. Many ancient and early medieval Hindu
and Buddhist stories likewise describe the mixture of fear and wonder produced by
human-like animations and include stories very similar to the account of the artiﬁcial
man introduced to King Mu.
The Uncanny Valley
In 1970, Masahiro Mori, a Japanese robotics professor at the Tokyo Institute of
Technology, published an essay titled ‘The Uncanny Valley’ in a Japanese
(continued)

journal Energy, where it lay relatively unnoticed until more recently when it
started to attract considerable attention [94].
2.5
A Brief History of AI Ethics
65
Mori hypothesised that in creating human-like robots, humans would
respond with empathy, interest, and concern, as the robot acquired
recognisably human features, until the robot became sufﬁciently lifelike, to
inhabit an ‘uncanny valley’ of revulsion. A person would be able to tell
immediately that the robot was not in fact human, but had sufﬁcient similar-
ities to create feelings of eeriness.
Interest in Mori’s idea has been provoked in those exploring human-
computer and human-robot interaction, and in those exploring the possible
biological and psychological roots of such a phenomenon.
There seems to be no end of ancient tales of robots and sex. A tale retold in
different traditions from around the second century BCE onwards describes the
attempt to lure a foreign guest with a girl left in his room to arouse his passions.
The ‘girl’ turns out to be mechanical, falling to pieces in his arms. Falling for an
illusion and giving into desires again are enduring themes in discussions of today’s
technologies.
Robot guards or warriors are also a common theme. A Buddhist legend concerns
automaton warriors built to defend the remains of the Buddha and armed with
whirling blades to slice any intruders into pieces. (Such a picture may contrast
somewhat starkly with the peaceful image Buddhism generally enjoys.) Interest-
ingly, the story tells that the robot makers lived in the land of the East, or the area of
Greco-Roman-Byzantine culture. The Greek legend of Talos of Crete is of a bronze,
animated guardian made by Hephaestus, the god of technology, metallurgy, and
invention. Talos followed precise instructions in warding off trespassers, such as
picking up rocks and hurling them at people, but could also be swayed by
suggestion.
The question of Talos’ hybrid nature between inanimate and living gave rise to
questions about human control over such creatures. The Golem of Jewish folklore is
a creature animated from clay and mud. There are many different accounts of how
precisely Golem came about and various different stories about him. Many stories
concern the problem of how to control Golem; in some, he desecrates the Sabbath; in
others, he is rejected in love and goes on a murderous rampage. It would appear that
such animated creatures can form a screen onto which humans project many of their
largest fears, although what precise conclusions are drawn can also vary
considerably [95].
It is notable in the Judeo-Christian tradition that the ﬁrst human, Adam, was
likewise created by God breathing life into the dust of the ground to create a living
soul. It is also notable that God had a control problem with his creation: Adam and
Eve quickly disobeyed his commands. Even if these accounts are ‘just stories’, it is
remarkable how our stories about ourselves reﬂect our stories about our creations, in

which we take the place, in turn, as creature and created. We will consider the
creation of Adam again in Chap. 3 in discussing a well-known meme.
66
2
The Rise of AI Ethics
Writing AI relies on computer code, which is a form of language and a manner of
representation. Many of the most complex and vexed ethical questions facing us now
concern communication technologies. Therefore, we should note the many concerns
regarding previous advances in communication technology. Changes in the mode of
communication can produce profound changes in society and elicit consequently
profound hopes and fears.
For example, the development of the printing press in Europe had a highly
signiﬁcant impact on culture and politics, for example, playing a signiﬁcant role in
the Reformation as access to printed copies of the Bible greatly increased [96]. Mean-
while, printed books had already developed in China in the Han dynasty approxi-
mately 2000 years ago, leaving a long gap before printing made its mark on Europe.
However, even more fundamentally, writing itself, rather than particular means of
writing, came under severe attack in Plato’s dialogue The Phaedrus, 274c–277a
(which, ironically, we know about because it was written down) [97]. Socrates’
preference for spoken dialogue over writing has already been mentioned in Chap. 1,
and here Socrates articulates his views by referring to the myth that writing was an
invention of an Egyptian god, Theuth, who considered that writing would make
people wiser and improve their memories. Thamus, a god who was King of the
whole of Egypt, rebuked him however, accusing him of being unable to judge his
own creation fairly, infected as he was by fatherly bias. ‘This discovery of yours will
create forgetfulness in the learner’s souls, because they will not use their memories;
they will trust to the external written characters and not remember of themselves.
The speciﬁc which you have discovered is not an aid to memory, but to reminis-
cence, and you give your disciplines not truth, but only the semblance of truth; they
will be hearers of many things and will have learned nothing; they will appear to be
omniscient and will generally know nothing; they will be tiresome company, having
the show of wisdom without the reality’ [97].
It may be startling to consider that a ﬁgure known as the founding father of
Western philosophy has such views about the dangers of the written word, but we
can think of this more positively as arguing in favour of the beneﬁts of dialogue,
which I have wished to stress particularly in ethics, which has to be something
understood and developed. Socrates argues that truth is to be found in dialogue,
complaining that the written word cannot answer questions put to it; engaging in
addressing questions, responding to others, and accountability are hallmarks of good
practice in ethics.
Exercise 13
Consider Socrates’ views on written language and the spoken word.
Do you ﬁnd any truth in them?
How might they apply to forms of speech and writing in the Internet age?
Machinery Computing involves both software and hardware, so as well as consid-
ering the history of concerns about language and writing, historical concerns about

machinery are also of interest. Just as AI has been called the Third Industrial
Revolution, there is one group who features large in the history of the First Industrial
Revolution, a group whose name is often called upon today: the Luddites.
2.5
A Brief History of AI Ethics

The Luddites
In debates about technology, it has become a commonplace to call an oppo-
nent a ‘Luddite’. This accusation implies a strong dismissal of the advances of
technology: more than the mere failure to buy the latest iPhone, to accuse
someone of being a Luddite is to imply that they shun modern technology
(almost) entirely. As our daily lives become more and more dependent upon
technology, the charge of being a Luddite looks more and more ridiculous.
However, if we investigate who the Luddites were, a more interesting angle
emerges [98]. The Luddites operated in England during the First Industrial
Revolution and were active from around the end of the eighteenth century into
the ﬁrst years of the nineteenth. Named for Ned Ludd, a possibly mythical
ﬁgure who in 1779 allegedly broke two knitting frames in a ﬁt of passion, the
Luddites were known for objections to the mechanisation of skilled manual
work, such as the introduction of the power loom and knitting machines, and
for destroying the machinery involved in this.
As such, they are portrayed as destructive, and as making futile gestures
against progress. Arguments against them at the time, from those such as the
economist David Ricardo, rested on the twin claims that progress through
technology was both inevitable and beneﬁcial, and that advances in economic
prosperity were best attained by technological competitiveness.
However, revisionist historians paint a more subtle picture of Luddite’s
complaints about the introduction of new technology. Indeed, the very notion
of technological progress by which they are now condemned only developed
after they were active. Their main concerns were with the social implications
of the new technologies, including increased power of management and
economic implications for workers. They expressed scepticism that the main
reasons for the machines’ introduction were economic, given the large costs of
the machinery. In 1834 the Bolton weavers declared that power looms were
being introduced in order to ensure that management had greater control over
production, over the workers, and could prevent embezzlement.
To use the term ‘Luddite’ as a slur against critics of new technologies may
perhaps act to obscure valid concerns and to shut down debate.
Exercise 14
Look for occasions when the term ‘Luddite’ is used as a slur. This may be in
traditional media, in online forums, or in ‘real life’. Consider the precise context in
which it is used and what effect it has. Does it seem to have an impact on the
subsequent directions of argument? If so, does it seem to help or hinder debate and

understanding? Have you ever called someone a Luddite or been accused of
being one? Consider the precise context and how appropriate the label was.
68

The Rise of AI Ethics
What kinds of objections to the introduction of new technology might have some
validity, and which might be more spurious? Think about any underlying assump-
tions about the nature and value of progress.
Data and statistics Since much of the power of AI resides in its need for and
capacities to analyse data, it is also relevant to note that concerns about the use of
data and statistics, especially in relation to human beings, also have a history.
Signiﬁcant progress was made in the understanding of statistics in the nineteenth
century, which enabled governments to collect and analyse considerable bodies of
data. This was drawn on in tackling social issues and in providing an empirical basis
for policy and action. However, the phrase ‘Lies, damned lies, and statistics’,
variously attributed to British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli by Mark Twain
and by others to Twain himself, captures warnings not only about statistics per se but
can also be seen as a forerunner to concerns about the use of data in algorithms and in
machine learning. Perhaps Disraeli was referring to the ‘Blue Books’ of statistics and
data so often referred to in Parliament for determining action and crafting laws.
Beauty by Numbers
The Victorian polymath Francis Galton was a pioneer in measurement and in
statistics, and his somewhat comical endeavours to create a ‘beauty map’ of
the British Isles illustrate some of the questionable practices of trying to
capture something rather intangible in numerical form. Quite simply, it was
based upon nothing more than his own personal preferences, and involved
secretly recording impressions of women passing in the street in a selection of
geographical regions of Britain by pressing a clicker hidden in his pocket.
London won. Note that ‘beauty’ applied, for Galton, only to females [99, 100].
Exercise 15 Could something like beauty ever be captured by data and
statistics in such a way? Consider what might be the best way of doing this, if
at all possible.
Consider in general terms the attempt to measure what is important in
human life via data—a very amorphous question but vitally important in
considering many forms of AI to which we return later.
The terms ‘objective’ and ‘subjective’ have various applications and are
often overused. Nonetheless, it can be useful to ask yourself if there is any
‘objective’ way of measuring beauty.
It is also important to think of the purposes of data collection. Why might
someone want to make a ‘beauty map’ of the British Isles? Data frequently
enables power and control. Who is measuring whom, and to what purposes?
What other variables might correlate with ‘beauty’?
What ethical issues might Galton’s study raise, if any?

2.5
A Brief History of AI Ethics

Charles Dickens’ novels were frequently concerned with the position of the poor.
His novel Hard Times, ﬁrst published in 1854, is frequently drawn upon for his
views on how the working classes fared in industrial Britain [101]. Among his
complaints is the uniformity with which individual human beings are viewed within
an industrial system that treats everyone alike. These concerns were personiﬁed in
the character of the superintendent of a school, Mr. Thomas Gradgrind, whose
philosophy of education is based upon the importance of facts above all else. He is
introduced as ‘Thomas Gradgrind, sir—peremptorily Thomas Gradgrind. With a
rule and a pair of scales, and the multiplication tables always in his pocket, sir, ready
to weigh and measure any parcel of human nature, and tell you exactly what it comes
to. It is a mere question of ﬁgures, a case of simple arithmetic’ [101, Ch., p. 48].
Dickens considers that the human person, and all that is valuable in life, cannot be
captured in such mathematical terms. Note in passing that science ﬁction is often
usefully brought to bear in reﬂecting on AI ethics, but many general works of
literature can also be valuable.
Measurement, data, human happiness, and an important philosophical
debate Concerns similar to those of Dickens can also be seen echoed in an
important debate between two prominent utilitarian philosophers of the time, Jeremy
Bentham and John Stuart Mill, whom we will meet again later. We will explore this
debate now to introduce in a concrete form some aspects of ethical theory that are of
considerable relevance to the ethics of AI.
A philosophical detour With its philosophical roots in the eighteenth century,
utilitarian philosophers were at the centre of many social reforms in the nineteenth
century, and utilitarianism’s inﬂuence continues up to the present day as a major
player in questions of practical ethics in many ﬁelds as we shall see. Utilitarianism
has many variations, but in its classical forms, it is a system of ethics focused upon
bringing about the best possible consequences. To do so, it must therefore use some
system of calculating and measuring alternative courses of action to determine what
the best course of action is, conceived, in the classical form of utilitarianism, as
maximising happiness and minimising unhappiness (or pleasure and pain). Many
questions thus arise about how to measure happiness and what, indeed, happiness is,
for unless something is understood with a reasonable degree of precision, it will be
hard or impossible to measure and thus impossible to include in calculations. To
conduct comparisons, it will also be vital to ﬁnd a measure that applies across
different domains.
Jeremy Bentham produced a ‘feliciﬁc calculus’ by which to measure happiness,
famously concluding that ‘The utility of all these arts and sciences,—I speak both of
those of amusement and curiosity,—the value which they possess, is exactly in
proportion to the pleasure they yield. Every other species of preeminence which may
be attempted to be established among them is altogether fanciful. Prejudice apart, the
game of push-pin is of equal value with the arts and sciences of music and poetry’
[102, 103]. Push-pin was a simple game where two or more players had to roll dress-
making pins across a table, attempting to ‘take’ the pins of other players by rolling

over their pins. Bentham himself was very fond of various games and loved music
but was also known to dislike poetry.
70
2
The Rise of AI Ethics
Bentham’s Feliciﬁc Calculus
To a person considered by himself, the value of a pleasure or pain considered by
itself, with be greater or less, according to the following four circumstances: 1 Its
intensity.
2 Its duration.
3 Its certainty.
4 Its propinquity.
But when the value of any pleasure or pain is considered for the purpose of
estimating the tendency of any act by which it is produced, there are two other
circumstances to be taken into account; these are,
5 Its fecundity . . .
6 Its purity.
[When a community is considered, it is also necessary to take account of]
7 Its extent; that is, the number of persons to whom it extends. [16, 104]
Notes: fecundity refers to the tendency of an action to produce further
pleasure or pain. Purity refers to whether an action is mixed with pain or
pleasure. Propinquity is no longer a common word—it simply means how
close at hand a potential source of pleasure is.
His godson John Stuart Mill was greatly inspired by Bentham but argued strongly
against the view that all sources of happiness were equivalent to each other, insisting
that there were both ‘higher’ and ‘lower’ pleasures. Mill in fact gave two attempts at
articulating the difference between higher and lower pleasures, attempts which are
not easy to reconcile to each other. First, in somewhat mathematical terms, Mill
produced a (somewhat unsatisfactory) deﬁnition: a higher pleasure is one preferred
over any amount of another pleasure, even if it is accompanied by a great amount of
discontent, by those who are acquainted with both kinds of pleasure and are thus
competent to make such a judgement. Second, Mill then goes on to discuss the
‘unquestionable fact’ that human beings have a marked preference for ‘the manner of
existence which employs their higher faculties’. In his discussion of why this might
be, concluding that it is most appropriately explained by ‘a love of dignity, which all
human beings possess in one form or another, and in some, although by no means
exact, proportion to their higher faculties’ [105, Ch. 2.5, 2.6].
Exercise 16
Mill famously wrote: ‘Few human creatures would consent to be changed into any of
the lower animals, for a promise of the fullest allowance of a beast’s pleasures; no
intelligent human being would consent to be a fool, no instructed person would be an
ignoramus, no person of feeling and conscience would be selﬁsh and base, even
though they should be persuaded that the fool, the dunce, or the rascal is better
satisﬁed with his lot than they are with theirs. They would not resign what they

possess more than he, for the most complete satisfaction of the desires that they have
in common with him’ [105, Ch 2.6].

First, note that elements in this series of comparisons are each different. They
might each then bring in different ethical issues. Consider if you agree or disagree
with this statement in any respects. Hint: in philosophy, as in any area, it is very
possible to ﬁnd aspects of a philosopher’s work valuable, even if overall one
disagrees. Consider too how we might be able to test the truth of such a claim.
Second, think as widely as possible what relevance such thoughts may have to AI
and to how automation is impacting our lives, including our personal day-to-day
lives and our working lives. Think about this in terms of the goals of AI and of its
practical impact, as well as the general question of measuring outcomes in ethics and
in human well-being.
Exercise 17
Suppose you were attempting to programme AI to perform morally and to increase
human happiness or well-being. You also wish to have a measure for human
happiness. How useful would you ﬁnd Jeremy Bentham’s feliciﬁc calculus, and
how might you improve upon it?
More on data: a twentieth-century story Much has been written about the use and
misuse of data concerning human subjects. The collection of such data by bodies
such as governments has enabled valuable medical research, for example, research
tracking the intergenerational effects of nutrition on development and health over a
lifetime using data from the Dutch famine [106]. It has also enabled the surveillance
and classiﬁcation of populations for far more sinister purposes by authoritarian and
murderous states [107]. Use and misuse of data is nothing new: the possibilities
presented by increases in computing power only amplify this. There are strong links
between the development of computer power and the hunger for data for particular
purposes.
Jill Lepore traces a fascinating history of the development of computers and the
rise of data science in the mid-twentieth century [108]. The company in question was
the now scarcely remembered Simulmatics Corporation, founded in 1959. This
presents a history of computing far removed from a vision of abstract bofﬁns
grappling with the foundations of thought for the sake of pure inquiry. Rather, it
paints a history replete with the quest for power, for the ability to predict and
manipulate the general public, viewed as members of demographic groups, for the
purposes of commercial and political power. Politicians wishing to win elections
sought help from social scientists, not so much to understand as to predict behaviour
and to target political messaging. National defence was a justiﬁcation for work on
understanding social networks through analysing data. The Kennedy election in
1960 used the assistance of computing power to help determine the precise political
messaging to produce. Critics argue that Lepore overstates the importance and role
of Simulmatics in the use of data for political messaging and propaganda [109], but
nonetheless, such tales illustrate the messy history and embeddedness of computing,
social science, behaviour manipulation, and power.

The Rise of AI Ethics
Computers in the twentieth century: warnings about their dangers Alan Turing
should need no introduction if you are reading this book. He famously gave
warnings about the possibilities of computing. In BBC lecture broadcast in 1951,
he claimed that if machines were given the capacity to think, they would soon be able
to outstrip the thinking capacities of humans, in part because they would be able to
improve their own thinking skills by communicating with each other. So that sooner
or later, the machines would, with this superior ability, take control of our lives
[110]. This is thus the age-old control problem: the fear that our creations would take
over. We can thus ask this question of Turing’s statement: given his far-reaching
vision and his role in the development of the computer, was his warning based on
insights into the technological capabilities of computers? Or was he rather merely
expressing an age-old fear that humans would be controlled by the very technologies
they created? Or could both be true at once?
However, perhaps a more complex question about the relationships between
humans and technology had already been raised by Norbert Wiener, the pioneer of
cybernetics. In God & Golem, Inc., Wiener warned of those who impatiently wish to
extend human limits that the accumulated wisdom of humanity, contained in myth,
legend, and literature, should warn of the dangers of this two-edged sword [111].
Wiener’s cybernetics focused on complex interactive feedback loops, which he
used to analyse many problems and to understand intelligent behaviour and pro-
cesses, including both in living things and in the interactions between humans and
machines. In The Human Use of Human Beings, Wiener expressed many fears about
how technology may partake in feedback loops with deleterious impacts on humans,
for example, in displacing jobs and controlling humans [112]. By including the idea
of feedback loops, we can understand the control problem of AI not simply as a
straight battle between humans and computing power but as necessitating a more
complex set of questions about the interaction between the two.
Likewise, Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989 but has come
to express deep regrets about how it is being used and the impact it is having
[113]. His worries seem to stem from a more complex web—forgive the pun—
than simply the relatively straightforward fear of humans losing control over tech-
nology, since they concern differential impacts upon different human beings. Almost
30 years after its inception, Berners-Lee started to express grave concerns that the
web was only partially living up to its ideals as an open platform operating across
geographical and cultural boundaries which would allow anyone to collaborate and
share information, ideas, and opportunities. His concerns focus on the loss of control
over personal data, the ready spread of misinformation on the web, and the lack of
transparency and understanding of political advertising.
Exercise 18
Concerns expressed by pioneers such as Turing, Wiener, and Berners-Lee may be
taken seriously by virtue of their expertise and status as founder ﬁgures. However,
remember that in Plato’s Phaedrus, the god Thamus viewed Theuth, the god who
invented writing, as unable to assess it fairly, out of parental blindness to the failings
of his offspring. Perhaps this means that warnings about technology from its creator

are to be heeded, but praise should be viewed more sceptically. Does one’s role in
developing a technology, especially perhaps in its early or foundational stages, give
one special capacities to assess its values and dangers? Consider arguments both for
and against this proposition. An answer will have relevance to the conduct of AI
ethics.
2.5
A Brief History of AI Ethics
73
Whatever your answer to such a question, key ﬁgures in AI have inﬂuenced the
agendas and directions of AI ethics. Berners-Lee is actively working to address
problems of the World Wide Web. In 2014, Stephen Hawking told the BBC that the
future of AI might even mean the demise of the human race, which exceeds in
calamity even many of the dire forecasts of antiquity [114]. In the same year, Elon
Musk also stated that he considered AI to be our biggest existential threat [115]. In
an interview with Wired the following year, Hawking notably also used the language
of legend and story in saying, ‘The genie is out of the bottle’, fearing that AI would
replace humans altogether and that a self-replicating AI could be a new form of life
that overtakes humanity [116].
Exercise 19: Food for Thought
We have seen fears of the position that machines may take midway between the
animate and the inanimate. We can even see questions about borders and boundaries
in the ﬁgure of speech I purposefully used here: thought requires brainpower, which
quite literally requires food, but ‘food for thought’ reminds us of our own mixed
position between the mental, the abstract, and the physical or animal realm.
The capacity to replicate itself is one hallmark of life. However, how might this in
itself be seen to threaten the place of humans, and how might it be connected with
outperforming humans?
In 2015, an open letter ‘Research priorities for robust and beneﬁcial artiﬁcial
intelligence’, signed by thousands including many prominent people such as Haw-
king and Musk and including many in the ﬁeld of AI such as Stuart Russell, Peter
Norvig, Demis Hassabis, and many others, was published on the Future of Life
Institute’s website [117]. This takes a notably different tack to prognostications of
doom and is linked to a detailed document of priorities of research directions
intended to maximise the social beneﬁts of AI. The letter stated: ‘The potential
beneﬁts are huge, since everything that civilisation has to offer is a product of human
intelligence; we cannot predict what we might achieve when this intelligence is
magniﬁed by the tools AI may provide, but the eradication of disease and poverty are
not unfathomable.’
Exercise 20
Is ‘everything that civilisation has to offer’ a product of human intelligence? What,
indeed, does ‘civilisation’ have to offer?
Hint: This question is intentionally vague and may provide you with some food
for thought for later discussions. We will return to this theme in Chap. 5 when we
discuss intelligence in greater detail.

The Rise of AI Ethics
Computing ethics and AI ethics There is now a multitude of work proceeding on
AI ethics, within both academia and outside; within commercial settings, govern-
ment and regulatory organisations, and civil society groups; and within the ﬁeld of
AI itself and in other ﬁelds. However, it is important to recognise that this has been
preceded by work on the ethics of computing by some decades, as well as work on
the ethics of technology more broadly. For example, Deborah Johnson’s book
Computer Ethics was ﬁrst published in 1985 [118], and dealt with many of the
same issues that are being approached today in relation more speciﬁcally to AI, such
as privacy, ethics in the online space, social implications of computing, and account-
ability and responsibility. The introduction to Johnson’s book also gives useful
insights into how computer ethics developed with the rise of computing after the
Second World War, from general fears that computers would take over human
decision-making to clearer and more speciﬁc articulation of issues developing in
the 1970s, such as questions about the dominance of an instrumental rationality and
concerns with hackers and property rights over software arising. The birth of the
Internet saw new issues arising, and ways in which computing could impact on
wider society evolving and increasing. Naturally, work on AI ethics builds upon
work in computing ethics more generally. Many other disciplinary ﬁelds and areas of
endeavour, such as science and technology studies, the study of human-computer
interaction, and work on responsible research and innovation, are growing and
burgeoning ﬁelds and have much to offer. The use by so much AI of large amounts
of data also means that the ﬁeld of data ethics is highly relevant to many questions in
AI ethics [119, 120].
The history of a ﬁeld and the neologisms There is a need to think with precision
about a subject to be careful about the terms one uses, and to ensure that their
meaning is clear. However, an unfortunate side effect of this can be that terms are
coined at certain points in a discussion which effectively act to block off access to
previous discussions on essentially the same point, but which used different terms. A
parallel example to this can be found in those cultures where women tend to change
their last names on marriage: this can make them much harder to trace, and histories
of women have suffered as a result of this.
This tendency to coining new terms can be a blight in academia where the internal
pressures to publish and to be cited can only encourage the practice of attempting to
be the ﬁrst person to use a particular term. This can act somewhat like planting one’s
ﬂag in ‘new’ territory, pointedly ignoring the footprints of one’s predecessors. For
example, the term ‘solutionism’ was allegedly coined in 2013 by Evgeny Morozov
to express the idea that every social problem can be solved by technology
[121]. However, this is largely the same idea as that of the ‘technological ﬁx’,
allegedly coined in 1965 by Alvin Weinberg [122]. Searches for work relating to
solutionism may miss important work dealing with the technological ﬁx. Further-
more, the same idea may have been discussed long before anyone gave it a speciﬁc
name. Terminological difﬁculties can also happen frequently in areas of study where
different disciplines intersect; a relative newcomer may discuss a phenomenon under

one term, thus potentially eclipsing work that discusses essentially the same phe-
nomenon under a different label.

AI Ethics Now: Who, What, Where, and Why?
Summary
A brief overview is given of some of the organisations addressing AI ethics and
keeping track of the issues.
It can seem as if everybody is involved in AI ethics now, and if they are not, it is
because they are complaining about it and arguing that a different approach to
addressing the issues of new technologies is better, just as many of those working
within AI ethics are arguing about different approaches to methodology and different
practical approaches to implementation. There are many working in AI itself
attempting to address ethical questions within their work; academics working across
different disciplines contributing to debates; lawyers, regulators, and policy makers
addressing these questions; dedicated research centres and think tanks; funders are
ﬁnancing many such efforts; civil society groups are involved; and corporations and
companies are also addressing ethics (or, claiming to do so). In fact, it is so hard to
keep up with what is going on, with who is researching and debating issues, that
there are organisations and websites dedicated to keeping track, such as
AlgorithmWatch, which has a searchable database for an AI Ethics Guidelines
Global Inventory, as well as many newsletters and reports to which one can
subscribe.

Consider the nature of the different organisations examining these issues
and producing material.
It is important to consider the context of ethical discussion and debate, claims,
and practical steps towards implementation. It matters who is asking the questions;
what their vested interests are, if any; and what background assumptions, beliefs, and
motivations might frame discourse. For instance, a large corporation ﬁrmly wedded
to AI is a very different entity from an academic centre, but perhaps an academic
centre may be reliant on certain funding sources. Those working closely with
technologists developing AI may have an extremely good understanding of the
cutting edge of AI and of its technical details, but then, on the other hand, may
lack a critical distance that more independent commentators and critics may possess.
Politicians and policy makers may wish to regulate ethical questions, but concerns
with national self-interest and the development of science and industry and eco-
nomic factors may of course inﬂuence outcomes. Power and inﬂuence will make a
difference to what the ethical issues are seen to be, which issues receive the most
attention and funding, which issues are effectively translated into making a mean-
ingful difference, and what are empty words and promises.
Consider the ultimate end of ethics conceived in such close proximity to the
technology it assesses, to those who directly beneﬁt ﬁnancially and to the political
interests of a governing elite. Is it some abstract notion of the good society, beneﬁt
for the individual, conceptualised in a disinterested manner, and free from the
inﬂuence of technology and technologists? Or is it in reality the goal of producing
technology that has its path to implementation smoothed by the veneer of ethics?
Will ethics as a practice simply serve technology? One, perhaps cynical, view is that
the practice of ethics will simply ﬁne-tune technological development to a palatable
form, with occasional concessions to appear willing. Another even more cynical
view is that the practice of ethics simply serves technological progress by ensuring
that the values inherent in the technology appear to be ‘for the greater good’.
Exercise 21
Many tech companies have information on their websites and sometimes are
included in advertising regarding their ethical stances and any action they are taking,
including slogans (such as Google’s famous, or infamous, ‘don’t be evil’). Look up
some of these, compare a few, and consider their content, their mode of expression,
and how much they can be trusted. How easy is it to ﬁnd veriﬁable and plausible
information about the ethical stance of such companies?

AI Ethics, Law, Policy, Regulation, and Ethics
Guidance
Summary
How conceptions of ethics might help or hinder translation into practical impact.
This book does not deal with the details of how to implement speciﬁc policies and
regulations regarding AI ethics. I focused speciﬁcally on developing and
implementing codes of ethics for AI in my 2017 book, Towards a Code of Ethics
for Artiﬁcial Intelligence [123], and many others have also produced work in this
area, which is ongoing. This is an immensely complex ﬁeld requiring detailed
speciﬁcation of law, public policy, and technologies. Nonetheless, the general aim
of this book is to contribute to understanding ethics in ways that will lead to real-
world impact and enhance policy, regulations, and practical ethics guidance. To do
so, we need to consider methodologies in ethics, examining how conclusions may be
reached, which itself is a complex and disputed question, which we examine head on
in Chap. 4. We also need to consider how to enhance debate and discussion about
ethics in an interdisciplinary context, which is in essence a key ambition of this book.
Some very general issues regarding the nature of ethics will help to shape
attitudes towards embedding ethics in policy and regulation. Many of these will be
discussed again throughout the book. They include questions about responsibility
and how it can be attributed, a critical issue in developing practical policy, for
without clear notions of accountability and responsibility, we cannot produce work-
able policy. The role of principles in ethics is also a pivotal question. Can we capture
the entirety of ethical concerns in a set of rules? If not, how should we approach
codes and regulations?
Ethics as a process Sometimes ethics is conceptualised as something to set straight
at the start of an endeavour, an unchanging set of commitments. However, it is often
more helpful to understand it as a process. This may be especially the case with
policy and regulations concerning how ethics is embedded within the development
and implementation of complex technologies, with a need for checking along the
way and for feedback and revisions in light of deepening understanding of progress.
This is nowhere more necessary than in dealing with fast developing technologies
with complex and wide-reaching impacts upon society and individuals such as with
AI. Policy and regulations need to be designed to be adaptive.
Ethics, power, and motivation to act A central feature of ethics is so obvious that
it may escape us: people do not always do something they know is right. They also
do things they know are wrong. Power is frequently misused. Closely related to this,
people often swayed by other interests into fooling themselves that their behaviour is
justiﬁed. There is a complex tangle of different interests involved, and the complex-
ity and magnitude of the economic forces at play here cannot be overlooked. Policies
that include attention to ethics are frequently produced in the context of wider
economic and industrial interests. Many nations are currently aiming to become

leaders in innovating AI [124]. Never for a minute assume that just because
something is labelled ‘ethics’, it is simply and solely about ethics, let alone that it
is genuinely ethical. When assessing policies, therefore, it is important to ask
yourself where the power and authority behind policies and guidance lies and who
is being allowed into the conversations. Ethics concerns relationships between
people, and the nature and quality of the relationships, and the dialogues that
contributed to the construction of policy and regulation, must be considered. The
growth and development of relevant civil society groups, public engagement, and
education about the issues are all needed.

The Rise of AI Ethics
Exercise 22
Search the AI Ethics Guidelines Global Inventory, pick one of the guidelines, and
consider any or all of these questions:
Who is producing the guidance?
What is the source of the power and any authority for the guidance?
Who is affected by the guidance?
Who is given any speciﬁc or general responsibilities?
Is the guidance local, national, etc.?
Is there a preamble introducing the guidance, an account of motivations, and so on?
What is its content—a set of rules, for example, recommendations, mandates, and
suggestions?
How speciﬁc are any rules, mandates, etc.?
Does the guidance call for ethics training, and if so, how is this understood?
Does the guidance refer to ‘experts on ethics’ or similar, and if so, what are these?
Is the guidance inspirational, idealised, or more concrete and practical?
What is being said, and what is being left out?
Is the guidance explicitly about ethics—or about something else as well?
Who stands to gain from the publication and implementation of the guidance?
What other questions might you be asking?
As a group exercise, it would be useful to pick different guidelines and compare
and contrast your answers.
2.8
Looking Forward: What Is Our Job Now?
We have taken a look at some debates about how we should understand ethics in this
arena, for instance, at the concern that if ethics is portrayed as centrally involving
individual responsibilities with no reference to power issues or social factors, this
may narrow our view of matters and prevent us from looking more broadly at
solutions. This shows the importance of digging more deeply into different ways
of understanding ethics and broader value questions. Many debates about the
application of ethics to concrete issues stem from assumptions about the nature of
ethics itself and rest in turn upon assumptions about the nature of responsibility,

agency, and other questions, which are wide open to different interpretations and
often diametrically opposed viewpoints. We should also question whether we
already know what the issues are that need to be addressed in AI ethics. Do we
know what the issues are now, and is it a matter of just making sure they are
implemented? We have already seen that there is a need to dig deeper and that it’s
possible to miss some important questions. We need to look at the methodology.

Case Study: An Indigenous AI Report
Summary
We have seen how important it is to consider the potentially distorting effects of
dominant voices. This section introduces an example in work exploring indigenous
approaches to AI. Some points to note include a focus on local knowledge, com-
munity, and relationships.
We have seen that many ethical guidelines and regulations concerning AI are being
produced. There are commonalities between many of these, as well as differences.
We have also seen concerns that debates may be shaped and dominated by view-
points from certain parts of the world. It is important to question what issues are
being brought forwards for consideration and not just what conclusions are drawn
but also how we should think about the issues.
The Indigenous Protocol and Artiﬁcial Intelligence Working Group was formed
with two workshops in 2018 (indigenous-ai.net). The group is concerned with
developing new AI systems and addressing both conceptual and practical questions
posed from an indigenous perspective about AI. The development of AI and
questions of ethics and value are thus closely intertwined. While there are differences
between different indigenous groups from around the world, one of the group’s aims
is to broaden discussions of society and technology beyond the relatively narrow
cultural milieu of Silicon Valley startup culture. Therefore, as well as being of great
interest in and of itself, an examination of their concerns should also be informative
and helpful for those wishing to reﬂect upon the possible limitations of currently
dominant views in AI ethics. As we shall see, these concerns immediately stretch
beyond ethics and speak to some of the broad questions in AI ethics that we have
already raised.
The questions addressed by the working group include asking what, from an
indigenous perspective, are the proper relationships with AI. A focus on relation-
ships may produce a different perspective than a focus on, for example, outcomes,
which may be dominant in approaches that stress that AI should bring about the
outcome of beneﬁt to society. The workshops also addressed how to imagine a future
of ﬂourishing for both humans and nonhumans. This also sets this approach apart
from many other sets of guidance and discussions of AI ethics that focus mainly, or
exclusively, on human beings.

The Rise of AI Ethics
In addition, the scope of inquiry is broadened from ethics to include asking how
indigenous epistemologies and ontologies might contribute to global discussions of
AI and society. In other words, the indigenous AI working group saw the need to
consider frameworks for understanding what knowledge is, how we acquire it, and
how we value it, as well assumptions and commitments to what kinds of things there
are—one’s ontology. How might these questions be relevant to ethics in AI?
Here are two simple examples to illustrate the potential relevance of both
epistemology and ontology to questions in AI ethics. Many (but by no means all)
who are currently living in the West consider that everything in the world can be
boiled down to material reality, so that everything that exists and everything that
happens can ultimately be understood in terms of basic, observable science—the
laws of physics, chemistry, and biology. There is no spirit, no soul, and conscious-
ness can be explained entirely as arising from brute matter. This often goes hand in
hand with the claim that we will ultimately be able to understand this material reality
through scientiﬁc knowledge, but this optimistic view of our capacity to understand
the world is not a necessary corollary of the view that material reality is all that there
is. However, if one believed that there is more to the world than that which can be
understood through our current scientiﬁc methodologies, perhaps considering that
there are spirits or souls, one will start out from rather different premises in
addressing many questions about the nature of AI, of advanced robots, of the
possibilities of human enhancement with technology, and of our relationship with
technology. If we believe that we, human beings, are able fully to understand the
world, then we may both act on the assumption that to create intelligence in
machines is to model human intelligence and on the assumption that one day we
will fully understand both intelligence and consciousness and be able to reproduce
both in machines. The working group’s position paper expresses the concern that the
current development of AI may be too limited and too based upon certain rationalist
ways of understanding epistemology to be able to engage with the possibilities
created by the development of computational systems [125, p. 6]. Remember that
we have also seen responses to robots and expressions of fear around AI, which
suggest that the attitude that the world is more than mere ‘material reality’ is
commonly held. We return to such discussions in the last chapter.
The Guidelines for Indigenous-centred AI Design v.1 spells out a list of guide-
lines containing seven principles in no speciﬁc order of hierarchy.
Guidelines for Indigenous-Centred AI Design v.1
1. Locality
2. Relationality and Reciprocity
3. Responsibility, Relevance, and Accountability
4. Develop Governance Guidelines from Indigenous Protocols
5. Recognise the Cultural Nature of all Computational Technology
(continued)

2.10
Key Points
81
6. Apply Ethical Design to the Extended Stack (technology development
ecosystem)
7. Respect and Support Data Sovereignty [125, p. 20]
The principle of locality notes that indigenous knowledge is often rooted in both
speciﬁc territories as well as being of relevance in considering issues of global
importance. Principle 2 notes that indigenous knowledge is often relational and
states that AI systems should be designed to understand the relationships and
dependencies between humans and nonhumans. Principle 3 stresses the importance
for indigenous people of their responsibilities and accountability to communities.
Principle 5 points out that technology expresses cultural and social frameworks and
hence that AI system designers should be aware of their own cultural frameworks,
values, and biases and consider how to accommodate the cultural and social frame-
works of others.
Hence, these guidelines serve both to express particular concerns that indigenous
groups may have and to point to issues that all who are involved in designing and
using AI ought to be aware of: the relevance of our cultural and social frameworks,
the possibility of bias and of a limited view of the technologies we are creating and
using, and the need to look beyond a narrow understanding of ‘ethics’ to include
other issues concerning how we understand knowledge and our foundational pic-
tures of the world. We will return to many of these ideas throughout the book.
2.10
Key Points
There is currently considerable attention to AI ethics, often with claims that the
issues involved are novel. However, understanding how similar issues have been
dealt with in the past is essential to understanding and addressing the current
concerns.
Prior work, for example, in computer ethics, is highly relevant. Moreover, ﬁelds
outside of computing can have useful lessons. For example, many of the current
concerns in AI arise from its use of vast amounts of data. Work in medicine,
genomics, and social sciences has dealt with ethical issues arising from the use of
personal data.
It can be helpful to understand the large variety of different kinds of questions
arising in AI ethics.
Certain core values and concepts are prominent in current discussions of AI
ethics, but we must also be careful to consider other approaches to understanding
the issues.

The Rise of AI Ethics
Looking at historical concerns about robots and other technologies, including
writing technologies, can alert us to long-standing concerns and help us reﬂect upon
how we ourselves discern and understand concerns.
2.11
Educator Notes
This chapter can be used in many different ways. It will be helpful for all students to
be introduced to the idea that there is much past relevant work, as well as relevant
work from different subject areas. Student groups may have very different levels of
interest in the questions of history. Students from arts backgrounds might wish to
explore or research speciﬁc areas of history that interest them and share this material
with others.
There is ample opportunity for students with different interests to bring their own
expertise to bear and hence in a mixed class for students to undertake different work
to bring to the class. For example, it would be very useful for students with some
understanding of how a different subject area, such as the social sciences, has
approached issues such as the handling of human data to explore the relevance of
this for questions in AI ethics. This could be useful to underline the necessity of
diverse contributions to AI ethics.
The exercises in Sect. 2.4 present an introductory overview of issues as a taster to
material, which will be explored in more detail later. They can be useful for students
to attempt even without any further background research. Many of the cases and
aspects of exercises will be referred to again later. This can provide a chance for
students to see how their thought has developed. The exercises cover a wide range of
issues, and educators may of course wish to concentrate on certain themes and
issues only.
Debate and extended essay and project topics Exercise 20 would form a good
debate or class discussion topic because it raises very general themes about the value
and possibility of AI, is often cited, and will be referred to again later. Exercise
22 would be a useful class exercise or individual or group project to ensure that
students have a broad overview of a range of central issues.

AI, Philosophy of Technology, and Ethics
Abstract To understand many of the ethical questions that arise in relation to AI,
we must understand how it is viewed as a technology. Different perspectives tend to
shape some key questions, such as the ways in which humans and AI are compared
and contrasted. The chapter gives an introductory overview of the philosophy of
technology, highlighting issues that underlie some of the ethical questions we
examine in later chapters. These include questions about the proper relation of
technology to nature, such as whether it mimics or should attempt to exceed nature,
the proper relation of humans to nature, the nature of scientiﬁc and technological
knowledge, and the implicit values of technology. The philosophers discussed
include Plato, Aristotle, and Heidegger. We also explore the ethical issues that
may arise from the use of AI in communication technologies and the impacts on
how communications are viewed and on relationships.

Artiﬁcial Intelligence, Ethics, and AI as a Technology
Summary
Different ways of thinking about and working with AI raise questions about how it is
viewed as a technology. This in turn underpins many of the ethical questions
about AI.
A brief introduction to artiﬁcial intelligence is given in Chap. 1. Many readers of
course will have a far more sophisticated and technical understanding of
AI. Chapter 1 outlined some distinctions that will be useful in addressing questions
of ethics. In considering the ethical questions of AI, we need to consider it as a
particular form, or forms, of technology. Before we consider questions more
straightforwardly understood as ethical per se, we turn now to consider the question
of how we understand and relate to technology.
We saw that ethical questions arise in relation to AI for a variety of rather
different reasons. Some arise from detailed technical aspects of its operation, such

as from the problem that it is often opaque to us how precisely machine learning
algorithms reach their conclusions, or from questions about the precise provenance
and representativeness of the data used to train machine learning algorithms. Some
questions arise from how we conceptualise and imagine the project of AI. It may be
conceived more prosaically as a loose collection of discrete attempts to tackle
speciﬁc problem-solving tasks. Or it may be conceived of more majestically or
hubristically as a project to ‘solve’ intelligence, to mimic human intelligence, or to
exceed human intelligence. The term ‘artiﬁcial intelligence’ came into common use
after the famous 1956 Dartmouth Summer school organised by John McCarthy
[1]. Some consider that the term ‘artiﬁcial intelligence’ sets us up to think about it
in a certain way—that it is aiming to mimic human intelligence, and believe that the
term should for this reason be avoided. Many now prefer to talk more directly about
‘machine learning’. This points to important questions about how we conceptualise
technology and what hopes we have for it, questions underpinning the ethical issues
that concern us.
92

AI, Philosophy of Technology, and Ethics
AI may use human intelligence, some ideal of reason, as a model. It may use
human brains, a naturally occurring phenomenon, as a model for technology. It may
use technology as a model to try to further our understanding of ourselves. These
various approaches reﬂect different attitudes and assumptions and hopes about
technology, and about views of the natural world, of intelligence, and of ourselves.
They reﬂect different levels of ambition. They incite both fear and excitement.
Hopes pinned on them range from making incremental improvements to robot
lawnmowers, to the transformation of society and of humankind.
The differences of opinion about some of the most outlandish ambitions, such as
the development of superintelligence, involve disagreements about the desirability
of pursuing such outcomes, about technical feasibility, and about the conceptual
coherence of supposing that an intelligence could recursively self-improve without
limit to a level far exceeding our intelligence. While some consider superintelligence
incoherent, others see it as inevitable.
The singularity The issues concern even the very possibility of our capacities to
conceptualise such a possible future. The singularity is a term ﬁrst coined by John
von Neumann in the 1950s describing accelerating technological progress. The term
was popularised by Vernor Vinge in 1993 in his essay ‘The Coming Technological
Singularity: How to survive the post-human era’ [2]. He envisaged a time of
runaway change over which we have no control, stemming from accelerating
improvements to technology as progress is driven not by us, but by the intelligent
technologies we have produced. This will create a ‘singularity’ where our old ways
of understanding the world no longer apply, an event horizon beyond which we
cannot currently see, because the world will be so different from our current world
that we cannot imagine what it is like. Some consider that we will be unable to
understand a superintelligence. It is always worth including the dates at which
certain claims about technology were made. The technology of the 1950s, the era
in which von Neumann coined the term ‘singularity’, now seems so quaint and so
primitive that it can be hard to grasp that it nonetheless represented signiﬁcant

progress. (Perhaps there is an event horizon in reverse, which prevents us from being
able to imagine how things used to be.)
3.2
Comparing AI to Humans
93
These debates all concern our powers to comprehend not just the world around us
but also the very technology that we ourselves have made, as well as our capacity to
recognise intelligence and consciousness, as these may manifest in technology. Note
that these debates also concern basic attitudes towards the very possibilities of
change and of progress and towards our powers to manipulate and control the
world. As we shall see, these questions have long been raised by those working in
the philosophy of technology.
AI is embedded in human society Artiﬁcial intelligence is often spoken of as if it
is something entirely separate from human beings—created by us, yes, but a discrete
entity of its own, something which can be understood, and the boundaries of which
can be delineated, without reference to human beings. This will produce a mislead-
ing impression, and although in considering ethical issues, we will often need to
hone in on certain aspects in isolation, the reference to the wider picture should
always be present as a background. AI is always going to be part of some larger
system, generally involving other technologies within which it is embedded but also
the processes of development, both their technical and human elements, which led
up to it and to its applications, both software and hardware [3]. Moreover, not only is
AI embedded in sociotechnical systems, much about AI itself is not so much
‘artiﬁcial’ intelligence insofar as it essentially involves human input and work.
Human ingenuity produces AI; examples of human intelligence train machine
learning; images are coded by human beings [4].
3.2
Comparing AI to Humans
Summary
This section introduces one of the central issues behind many of the questions of AI
ethics: the ways in which artiﬁcial intelligence is compared, implicitly or explicitly,
with human beings and their capabilities. An exercise explores ways in which
agency is casually attributed to AI.
We have already noted that many of the ethical questions of AI involve implicit or
explicit comparison of humans with AI. Indeed, AI and its success or failure may be
conceived in signiﬁcant part in terms of how well it manages to reproduce or exceed
human capabilities. Any such comparisons will involve value assumptions; for
example, the claim that AI has exceeded humans on some task involving intelligence
will always turn out to involve value assumptions about what constitutes ‘better’.
Any such comparisons will also always be made against background assumptions
and often complex conceptual frameworks that shape how we see (a) humans and
(b) machines.

AI, Philosophy of Technology, and Ethics
Many have pointed out that how we think of technology can affect how we think
of ourselves. Dog owners truly do, it seems, resemble their pets [5]. This provides
mild amusement for the human race (although who knows if dogs also get the joke).
However, the perceived resemblance of humans to technology may be more perni-
cious if in reality we are rather different. If we conceive of AI as reproducing human
intelligence, perhaps we will think of human intelligence as nothing more than the
product of a computer, and perhaps we will think of ourselves as nothing more than
computers [6, p. 4]. Perhaps this is an accurate picture. Perhaps not. Conversely, we
can project human qualities onto machines. Unless we are aware that this may be
happening, then any assessment of AI that involves a comparison with human
qualities will be wanting. We may be projecting onto AI a sense of humanity
which is not warranted, and maybe projecting onto humanity ideas which more
properly belong to machinery or to an inanimate world.
Human individuality and the narrative structures of human lives, with patterns of
strength, weakness, resilience, despair, and the limitations of our embodiment, are
elements we need to consider. Will such ever be attributed to machines? Consider
the ﬁelds of sport and music, which involve human skill, perseverance, and training
and which have their own standards of excellence. It is almost nonsensical to dream
of replacing human athletes and gymnasts with machines. For what reason would we
wish to do away with humans themselves playing sports? Competitions between
machine and machine and between human and machine could be great fun, because
a large part of the whole point of sport is achieving good performance, with different
degrees of competitiveness, whether your own personal goals, whether in a local
team, or in a ferocious international competition.
Limits Some points to note: the precise way in which comparisons are drawn, what
is included, what is omitted, and the ways in which we think of the limits of
achievement. There is a ﬁne interplay between attempting to go beyond the current
limits of the human body and appreciating those limits. Are these always something
to be transcended? Or could there be something about uniquely human limits that we
wish to retain?
Consider singing. The very limits of the human voice, its individuality, and the
capacity for breath are all part of music appreciation. We recognise the character of
the individual voice and its qualities and often the character of the person behind the
voice. Music appreciation is also often tied to our understanding of the backstory and
the people behind the music. Human frailty can add richness to our appreciation.
Perhaps this happens too, for some technology, as we show nostalgia for old
typewriters, vintage cars, fountain pens, and the like. However, our embodiment is
perhaps unique. One of my favourite singers is the contralto, Kathleen Ferrier.
Ferrier died of breast cancer, and the treatment she underwent caused osteoporosis.
During the interval for her last ever concert, a performance of Gluck’s Orpheus and
Eurydice at Covent Garden in London, a fragment of her hipbone sheared off
[7]. She must have been in excruciating pain. She returned to the stage for the
second half of the concert and sang as normal. Human beings can be awesome.

3.2
Comparing AI to Humans
95
Exercise 1
Artiﬁcial intelligence frequently involves attempting to extend human capacities.
Are there any occasions on which we would rather have the ‘bare human’, even if it
is ‘worse’, and if so, why?
Argue for and against the proposition that using ‘autotune’ to improve one’s
singing voice, rather than training yourself to sing in tune, is cheating in the same
kind of way that doping in sport is cheating. You can generate other examples of
your own and consider if you have different response in different cases.
We will repeatedly need to inquire whether AI can approach ethical questions and
judgements in the same ways as humans. Many of the ethical questions that concern
the use of AI to extend or replace human agency and human beings are shaped by
implicit assumptions by which the comparisons between humans and machines are
made. One of the recurring questions in AI ethics is the issue of control, and
likewise, one of the recurring questions in the philosophy of technology is whether
we control technology or whether technology controls us. Hence, to understand the
nature of these issues about control, we need to understand both our own agency and
that of machines.
The general question of how we compare and contrast human beings to artiﬁcial
intelligence is thus a major theme in AI ethics. To understand this in more depth, we
need to look further at how we think about human nature and at how we conceptu-
alise and value intelligence, which is naturally a major dimension of comparisons,
both of which we examine in Chap. 5. Forming a backdrop to this is the question of
how we conceptualise, and how we seek to use, technology, the topic of this chapter.
First, let us consider how technology may be described in comparison to human
beings.
3.2.1
Case Study: Attributing Agency to Humans and to AI
It is often very illuminating to read reports about the use of AI and to consider how
agency is attributed and distributed between human and machine elements in the
narrative. It is very common for writing to talk as if the AI itself had agency and as if
the humans involved lacked agency. Consider the question of the workplace. Even
favourable comments about the impact of AI on employment often talk of the
workforce passively and may hail the liberating impacts of job automation by
referring to jobs as boring, demeaning, or involving drudgery [8]. While not wishing
to deny the conditions under which many people work, one could also reasonably
consider that describing the work that millions of people do in such terms may also
denigrate those who do such work and negatively contrast their agency with the
agency that the same articles often impute to machines. People may be described as
being ‘left behind’ by this revolution. A selection of headlines illustrates the issue.
‘AI is quietly eating up the world’s workforce with job automation’ [9]. ‘Robots:
stealing our jobs or solving labour shortages?’ [10]. ‘Robots could take over

20 million jobs by 2030, study claims’ [11]. This almost makes it sound as if the
robots themselves are turning up to workplaces and rudely pushing human
employees aside, or simply beating all human candidates at interview. There are of
course many articles that attempt to redress the balance.

Exercise 2
Search for any article on a news site, tech journal, or academic journal that talks
about any aspect of artiﬁcial intelligence or automation in comparison to human
agency and consider how language expressing agency is used. Consider how writing
may deﬂect attention away from other sources of agency.
It is good practice to bear such language use in mind whenever you are consid-
ering the pros and cons of the use of AI.
3.3
A Brief Introduction to the Philosophy of Technology
Summary
This section outlines some central themes of the philosophy of technology, with the
aim of demonstrating the relevance of understanding these issues as a backdrop to
questions of AI ethics. A brief survey of the history of this ﬁeld ﬁnds that Plato and
Aristotle ask questions about the relationship of technology to nature, such as the
question of whether technology should mimic nature or try to exceed it. In the
twentieth century, Martin Heidegger examined our use of technology to extract
value from nature. His notion of standing reserve is introduced. The question of
knowledge in relation to technology is discussed, outlining Ryle’s distinction
between knowing how and knowing that. We consider how boundary questions
arise in relation to technology. Last, we look at the goals of technology and the
‘technological ﬁx’ and outline the relevance of the issues raised in this section for AI
ethics.
3.3.1
Preliminaries
Why look at the philosophy of technology in a book focusing on AI ethics? This
section indicates some ways in which debates within the philosophy of technology
might shape our understanding of ethical questions. We can also see how some
central questions concerning technology were already raised many centuries ago. As
so often, it will be to consider whether, to what extent, and how AI raises new issues
or ﬁts in with previous concerns and how questions in ethics relate to questions in
other areas of inquiry.
First, we make a preliminary observation about the relevance of technology to
ethical concerns. If science is descriptive, concerned with producing knowledge
about how things are, then technology is concerned with producing artefacts and

using tools and instruments to change the world in various ways, and thus,
concerned both with making new things and with how things ought to be. It is
therefore prescriptive. As such, it is an inherently normative activity, and hence its
aims and methods are inherently open to critique.
3.3
A Brief Introduction to the Philosophy of Technology
97
The normative issues may include questions that do not at ﬁrst sight appear to be
about ethics, such as questions about design aesthetics, ease of use, or efﬁciency.
However, it should be apparent that ethical questions may readily arise. For instance,
even a question about the attractiveness of the design of a product may have ethical
implications. Is constantly updating the design of a tech product accompanied by
great fanfares and publicity a way of selling incremental and largely insigniﬁcant
changes in said products to a gullible public, at the expense of their wallets, the
environment, and the badly paid workers who produce such products? Suppose a
product operated in ways that meant the users could easily remain unaware that vast
amounts of energy were being expended, and low-paid workers exploited, far away
and out of sight? Many other issues raised in the philosophy of technology underlie
some fundamental questions in AI ethics.
What is the philosophy of technology? As a ﬁeld, it is difﬁcult to deﬁne, covering
a wide range of questions and approaches. Some work focuses on the technology and
its characteristics as a practice within engineering and design. This includes work
attending to the nature of the artefacts (products) technology produces and work
looking at technology as the instrumental control by humans over the world. Other
work focuses more on attempting systematic examination of issues such as the
meaning of technology for society and culture and the consequences of technology
for humanity and for individuals. Some work attempts to address technology in
general, whereas much of it also looks at discrete instances of technology and its
application.
The ﬁeld known as philosophy of technology is relatively new, generally credited
with having started with the publication in 1877 of Ernst Kapp’s book Grundlinien
einer Philosophie der Technik (Elements of a Philosophy of Technology) [12], but
philosophical ideas about technology have a much longer history, and indeed, it is
often possible to trace how interest in such questions and attitudes towards technol-
ogy developed historically with developments in technology. We have already
looked at some historical examples of concerns regarding what might broadly be
called AI, including robots, and we can see broad historical inﬂuences on attitudes to
technology in general. For example, the rise in interest in alchemy in Latin Europe
around the twelfth century led to a fascination with the possibility that humans could
tap into and exceed the powers of nature, although later the arts of alchemy were
subject to intense critique. The power, fear, and fascination with alchemy have its
traces today in many of the different reactions to AI. Francis Bacon, 1561–1626,
renowned for his work on scientiﬁc method, lived in the period of the Renaissance
and had a broadly optimistic view of technology as an endeavour that should be used
for the beneﬁt of humanity and the improvement of life. His work The New Atlantis
envisaged a utopian society full of inventions such as ﬂying machines and sub-
marines [13]. Yet the fruits of the Industrial Revolution were mixed, and it early
became apparent to many that some of its consequences were deleterious. Samuel

Butler’s Erewhon (‘nowhere’ backwards) presents a utopia directly opposed to
Bacon’s: machines are banned, following concerns that a race of machines will
replace humans [14]. In the twentieth century, however, after the horrors of two
world wars and the possibilities of the nuclear bomb, a greater pessimism led to
considerable critique of technology visible in the work of philosophers such as
Martin Heidegger.

Exercise 3
Write your own AI utopia and AI dystopia. Throw a coin to choose if you write the
dystopia or utopia ﬁrst. Consider what if anything this tells you about your own fears
and hopes. Well, this could realistically take months, but you might want to jot down
one or two thoughts about what might constitute a dystopia or utopia for you
personally.
3.3.2
A Little History
Philosophy of technology was a concern of the ancient Greeks The ancient
Greek philosophers such as Plato and Aristotle often discussed techné (craftwork)
as the exercise of skill in particular areas, including what we now think of as
technology but also activities such as the practice of medicine and the arts
[15]. Their frequent discussion of crafts strongly suggested a positive attitude
towards practical skills despite their higher valuation of the more abstract life of
the mind, and Aristotle indeed used skill in craftwork as an analogy for the
development of virtue. Their discussion of craftwork forms a useful introduction
to some key themes in the philosophy of technology. We see that discussion of
technology involves claims about humans, the world, and the proper relationship
between the two.
For Plato, techné is based upon mimicry of nature. The natural world itself was
created by the Demiurge, a god who designed the world according to eternal patterns
that lie hidden behind the world as we see and experience it. Craftwork is thus
similar to nature in that its products are fashioned by someone towards the fulﬁlment
of certain goals. The craftsman exhibits skill in accomplishing the goals of a craft.
Aristotle, however, drew a contrast between the products of craftwork, artefacts,
existing in the domain of poiesis, and the natural world, or the domain of physis
[16]. The natural world is teleological, operating towards certain goals or functions,
and indeed, each thing within it has its own function towards which it aims. (We look
at Aristotle’s view of ethics later, which draws upon his views of the function of
man.) To this extent, then, the natural world is akin to the products of craftwork,
since these are also formed according to certain ends, which will vary according to
the craft activity and according to the particularities of context. However, things in
the natural world have ‘inward causes’, and products of craftwork have ‘outer
causes’ put in them by their designer. An ‘inward cause’ captures the idea that
things in the natural world operate according to their own particular ends and move,

form, or grow under their own powers. Remember that Aristotle was writing at a
time with rather different ideas about physics. An object that falls to the ground when
dropped was for Aristotle operating under its own inward cause to seek the ground.
Everything has a proper place in the world towards which it strives. So note that in
this respect, there is a similarity between biological beings and the purely physical
realm—what we tend to call ‘inanimate’ matter. The question of what distinguishes
living beings from non-living beings is one of profound relevance to some of the
questions raised by AI. One aspect of the ‘inward cause’ is that only things in the
natural world can reproduce themselves. Inanimate objects cannot, because that
would require an inward cause.
3.3
A Brief Introduction to the Philosophy of Technology
99
Mimicry, metaphysics, and morality We can thus see that certain issues arise with
implications for AI. In attempting to develop AI, are we attempting to mimic nature,
and if so, in what respects? More on this subject presently. Aristotle’s distinction
between inward and outer causes may be slightly strange but has an intuitive sense to
it. In the context of AI, we can transpose the distinction to the question of autonomy
and perhaps also to questions sometimes asked of AI, such as whether it is capable of
true creativity or any independent intelligence or thinking, or whether it merely stays
entirely within the limits of the inputs of the humans who created it. These meta-
physical questions, the categorisation of the world around us, and the delineation of
boundaries between categories of existence underpin and shape views on the nature
of autonomy and more broadly on the status and value of technological artefacts,
including artiﬁcial intelligence.
The views of Plato and Aristotle on the natural world may strike many modern
readers as unscientiﬁc and outmoded and to some even as peculiar but also raise
issues that will prove to be essential to comprehending and responding to some
claims made about AI. Many religions still of course regard the world as the product
of a creator and as made according to certain principles of design, often indeed as
good, although on some worldviews, as containing both good and bad forces. The
views of Aristotle that the natural world has its own inward causes and that it aims at
certain goals seems to imbue it with an agency and purpose. Note that biology also
draws heavily on talk of function, and ways of describing and explaining the world
frequently attribute some manner of agency. We will look more at concepts of nature
in the following section, but for now, note at least two questions relevant to
understanding and assessing technology: what impact technology may have on
nature and what inspiration it may take from nature are both questions that depend
upon what views are taken of nature itself.
Should technology mimic nature or exceed it? The idea that technology takes its
inspiration from nature has been common and implicitly rests upon the assumptions
that nature displays patterns and regularities that can be copied and recreated, and
implicitly, that these are good, or at least, that they have elements that are useful to
us. It also tacitly assumes that somehow, nature is not ‘enough’ for us, although we
are so used to how intertwined our lives are with technology that this point is easy to
miss. I am reminded of how habitual our technological lives are when hearing small

children ask in puzzled wonderment questions such as ‘why don’t animals wear
clothes?’ One then is brought into awareness of our utter dependence on technology.

AI, Philosophy of Technology, and Ethics
The question of whether technology could reproduce or even exceed nature was
brought to the fore with the fascination for alchemy in Europe. The project of turning
base metals into gold is one of extracting excess value. The lure of alchemy and the
stern denunciations it received are also mirrored in some reactions to the possibilities
of advanced AI, especially in the prospect of developing AI that is conscious, or
which is thought to exceed humans in some sense: turning base metals into gold may
be thought to be a precursor to attempts to turn brute matter into conscious intelli-
gence. (Of course, as explained, not all AI attempts to do anything so ambitious.)
Those who ridicule Sir Isaac Newton for his keen pursuit of alchemy, which seems
far more like magic than like science to the modern mind, might pause and reﬂect on
their own attitudes to certain scientiﬁc and technological endeavours [17]. It may on
occasion be useful to consider whether thoughts about ‘exceeding’ nature are in
some way present in discussions of AI, and what their legitimate role is, if any.
The twentieth-century philosopher Martin Heidegger posed the question of the
proper use by humanity of nature in his essay, The Question Concerning Technology
[18]. For Heidegger, the question of the right relationship to technology concerns
questions of being. This complex work raises questions about whether in modern
technologies humanity has a troubled relationship with nature. There is more than
one aspect of technology: an instrumental aspect, as a means to an end, and an
anthropological aspect, as a human activity. However, Heidegger warned that we
need to manipulate technology in an appropriate manner and that our attempts to
control it become ever more important as it develops powers that may defy our
attempts to control it [18, p. 5]. So far, so good. Writing in the mid-twentieth century,
it is hard not to see what Heidegger means.
Heidegger also saw technology as a form of knowledge, as a means of revealing
or uncovering. This aspect of his work is harder to grasp, but he considers that the
causes that lead to the creation of technology bring something to being which reveals
something to us: something is brought present to us. Hence, something previously
concealed is brought forth into ‘unconcealment’. This revealing is a form of truth.
One way of trying to grasp such a notion is to contrast it with a view that sees
artefacts as objects distinct from the material world out of which they are made. In
Heidegger’s view, it is as if technology, through the craftworker or the technologist,
actually works to show something, to reveal something, that was there in the world
as potential.
However, Heidegger contrasted traditional technologies with modern technology
in terms of how things are brought forth into the world. We can think of this
approximately as the claim that formerly this was somehow in alliance with nature.
However, modern technology makes demands and challenges nature to go beyond
what is wise to demand from it. He considers that modern technology places
unreasonable demands on nature, for example, insisting that vast amounts of energy
can be extracted and stored for use at will, in contrast to old technologies such as

windmills, which simply turn in tune to the weather rather than forcing power out of
the wind [18, p. 4]. This is always driving on to the maximum yield at the minimum
expense.

Standing reserve Heidegger used the example of a hydroelectric power plant built
into the river Rhine, which he considered to have a ‘monstrous’ element. The power
plant is not built into the Rhine as an old wooden bridge was, but the Rhine is built
up into the power plant. He contrasts two aspects of the Rhine: as dammed up into
the power plant and as expressed in the art of poetry to the Rhine by the poet
Hölderlin. Heidegger uses the term ‘standing reserve’ for this modern attitude to
nature: as something ordered to stand by to be ready for immediate use. The world is
there to serve what we demand of it. Other examples are coal mining, where the earth
is now revealed as a coal-mining district, and the rigours of modern agriculture, in
contrast to the agricultural work of the peasant ‘which does not challenge the ﬁeld’.
Exercise 4: Heidegger’s Notion of ‘Standing Reserve’
Does Heidegger’s notion that modern technology puts unreasonable demands on
nature have any resonance with you? This question can be approached by looking at
speciﬁc examples. Consider the example he uses of a hydroelectric power plant and
compare it to his example of an old-fashioned windmill. Is Heidegger being reason-
able, or is he extrapolating unfairly from a few examples?
The patchwork of ﬁelds and their boundaries of walls and hedges, which were
formed from centuries of agriculture, nonetheless likewise transformed the land-
scape. However, there is presently a strength of feeling among many that technology
has gone ‘too far’ in some often hard-to-express way. As you explore your own
views, try to critique them as much as possible, perhaps with help from
someone else.
What is a fair critique of a philosopher’s ideas? It would be easy to cast aspersions
on his examples as implying that erratic energy sources are preferable to reliable
ones and hard not to notice that he must have been familiar with the practice of
chopping down and storing wood to have a supply of energy throughout the harsh
German winter. Consider whether there is any value in his claims, even if the precise
examples may not always work.
Could his ideas be brought to bear in considering the expectations of modern
computing? Are the expectations that communication is constant, that goods are
delivered immediately, and that any question can be answered, every problem solved
with technology, and every question in science automatically answered by machine
learning—if such are indeed the expectations of AI—are these expectations some-
how akin to the expectation that the world should act as a standing reserve? Could
some applications of AI in fact operate to reverse any such tendencies?

Knowledge and Technology
The distinction drawn between technology and science is in part because of episte-
mic differences between them—differences in the nature of the knowledge involved.
Naturally, there is a very close relationship because science generally relies upon
often very sophisticated technology to make its discoveries. Technology likewise
relies upon scientiﬁc ﬁndings and itself often generates scientiﬁc ﬁndings in the form
of detailed knowledge needed to apply scientiﬁc discoveries in particular contexts.
We have seen how Heidegger saw technology as a form of knowledge, of an
uncovering of the world. However, the aim of science can be characterised as
discovery of the world, and technology aims to manipulate the world and to create
products. This involves knowledge, but a type of knowledge that many philosophers
have claimed to be distinctive.
Aristotle: Five Forms of Knowledge
Aristotle divided the soul into two parts, the rational part and the nonrational
part. By ‘the soul’, Aristotle did not refer to some spiritual substance distinct
from the body, but rather used the term to describe the particular organisation
of each type of creature—so in this sense, animals had souls too. The rational
part of the soul could have knowledge (‘virtues of thought’), which Aristotle
divided into ﬁve different categories [19, Book IV].
Episteme: science or scientiﬁc knowledge about the world (although note that
Aristotle was writing long before modern scientiﬁc methods were
established, and episteme referred to broadly ‘factual’ knowledge about
the world)
Techné: knowledge of arts and crafts, the skill needed to execute them
Phronesis: ‘prudence’ or practical wisdom, knowledge about how to achieve
goals in life, such as the general goal to live well (prudence is a standard
term still in frequent use but no longer translates very well in English)
Nous: intellect or intuitive apprehension of things, such as ﬁrst principles and
the foundation of knowledge
Sophia: wisdom, a state of perfection which can be reached in respect of any
type of knowledge
Note that both techné and phronesis relate to how we as humans act to bring
things about in the world, as contrasted to episteme, which concerns the world
as it is. This also interestingly makes techné have some similarities with the
kind of knowledge needed to achieve the life of virtue. Aristotle drew heavily
on the parallel skills of learning to master a craft in his account of how we
develop virtues of character.

Gilbert Ryle: Knowing How and Knowing That
Gilbert Ryle was a twentieth-century British philosopher who advocated
philosophical behaviourism, the theory that the mind could be understood in
terms of behaviour alone, which we examine in Chap. 8. Ryle distinguished
between two sorts of knowledge: knowing how and knowing that [20]. The
distinction was partly made in response to the views of philosophers who
attempted to model all knowledge on propositional knowledge, a proposition
being a claim about the world, knowledge claims like, ‘Paris has more days of
rain each year than London’, ‘There are no more bananas in the fruit bowl’,
‘Water contains hydrogen bonds’. These are knowing that claims: I know that
it rains more often in Paris than in London.
Knowing how concerns the ability to do things in the world, hence is
relevant to our discussions of technology. It is not necessarily translatable
into a series of factual explanations of what was done. Ryle argued that being
able to perform an operation does not require that one is able to formulate
precisely in words or complete sets of instructions how this is carried out, even
though one may be able to detect immediately if the task is being carried out
correctly or not, and even if one can teach others by demonstration. For
example, a sailor may be excellent at tying complex knots but completely
unable to describe precisely how this is done [20, p. 55].
A school friend of mine had recently arrived in the UK from East Africa, and her
mother, Mrs. Patel, spoke Gujarati but little English. I would help her mother with
English while she taught me Gujarati cooking. As a native English speaker, I could
speak grammatically without necessarily being able to explain what rules I was
following. As an expert cook, Mrs. Patel never weighed any ingredients but worked
by eye and by feel, and her instructions to me consisted mostly of showing me
mysterious spices and other ingredients that she would add to recipes with the simple
instruction, ‘Put!’ We got on just ﬁne.
Such examples have relevance to the question of how the way AI operates
compares to how human beings operate. One question concerns the issue of trans-
parency and explainability: do I know how a particular instance of AI works, if I can
use it effectively for speciﬁc purposes? What would this ‘knowing how’ consist of in
speciﬁc cases? Does it matter whether or not I have knowledge that it operates in
particular ways? Recall that certain efforts to explain how AI works do not attempt to
look inside the ‘black box’ (see Sect. 2.4.2).
Or consider this. Suppose an advanced robot closely observed Mrs. Patel’s
cooking and then drew up a long list of precise rules to replicate her delicious
recipes, which it then successfully executed. The robot then prints out a full list
including, for instance, the precise weight of all the spices and the precise cooking
times and temperatures. Does the robot then ‘know’ how to cook even better than my

friend’s mother? Hint: this answer seems to me absurd, but why? I am not at all sure.
Perhaps you have a different reaction.
104

AI, Philosophy of Technology, and Ethics
Ryle’s distinction between knowing that and knowing how can be in part
characterised by saying that ‘knowing how’ rests upon tacit knowledge, that is, it’s
a form of knowledge that may not, and perhaps cannot, be articulated in speech or
other formalised methods. A society and culture that values intellectual skills and
formal and overt expression of knowledge may thus downplay the value of tacit
knowledge, of ‘knowing how’, and of technological or craft skills in general. The
ancient Greeks who valued intellectual pursuits very highly—indeed Plato and
Aristotle saw the life of the philosopher as being the best—valued craftwork much
less. Likewise, it is easy to see similar attitudes around us, especially in industrial
economies and in the education system, although as ever the situation is complex.
Bear this in mind when considering applications of AI, robotics, and other technol-
ogies to replace certain types of jobs. We discuss the relationship between episte-
mology and ethics further in Chap. 7.
Exercise 5 and Reﬂection
To what extent might attitudes towards the value of craft knowledge be explained by
the value placed on formalising our knowledge in language (including in the
category of language formal expressions of meaning such as software, maths, and
musical notation)?
Might this have an impact on how AI is valued in certain applications?
Might fears of the difﬁculty of articulating and explaining the decision-making in
machine learning be (partially) explained by such a view?
Could it be that some skills are not amenable to formalisation in language due to
the very complexity of the skill and to the limits of language, rather than to some lack
on the part of those who possess a skill but who cannot fully explain all the steps
needed to execute it?
3.3.4
The ‘Technological Fix’
If technology is conceived as a way of achieving an externally speciﬁed goal, then an
assumption might arise that any goal or issue requires a technological solution.
Furthermore, any shortcomings in technology might be seen as simply needing more
technology—the ‘technological ﬁx’ or technological solutionism, which we noted in
Sect. 2.5.2 [21, 22]. Those immersed in particular branches of technology may
incline towards the kinds of solutions that their familiar ﬁeld provides. In the
words popularly attributed to Abraham Maslow, in possession only of a hammer,
everything looks like a nail. However, some problems may be best left alone, and in
some cases, the cure is worse than the disease. Some ‘problems’ are only problems
from certain perspectives. The phenomenon of the technological ﬁx may be part of
what seems to drive the impetus of technological development. Ironically, the more
buggy the tech is, the more it will require ﬁxing, and its own inadequacy can help to

drive the very appearance of its success. Certain terms capture these issues in speciﬁc
contexts.
3.3
A Brief Introduction to the Philosophy of Technology
105
Medicalisation is a concept introduced into the sociological critique of the practice
and powers of medicine in the 1970s in works such as Ivan Illich’s Medical Nemesis
[23]. It refers to the assumption that a problem a patient has is best dealt with within
the context of medicine using standard medical techniques such as surgery or drugs.
However, this is often based upon assumptions about aetiology and the potential for
remedies that leave much out of the picture, in particular, very often, social,
psychological, environmental, and economic factors. Including a fuller analysis of
causation may produce a better, more effective, more humane solution. There are
well-known debates within branches of medicine such as psychiatry where such
issues loom especially large [24]. The notion of an iatrogenic harm, where ill health
is caused by the practice of medicine itself, may perhaps be useful to borrow for
considering the practices of AI.
The practice of medicine, medical knowledge, and the construction of risk One
of the chief ways in which medical science and technology have advanced is in
producing vastly increased amounts of medical knowledge, both in the form of
general scientiﬁc understanding and in the provision of personalised information to
patients. It is especially pertinent to highlight this in relation to AI because one of the
current success stories is the contribution of machine learning to improving the
interpretation of medical imaging. The use of monitoring and tracking technologies
for individual health monitoring is also becoming widespread [25]. AI is contribut-
ing to a pre-existing trend of increased personal medical information. Prior examples
include the routinisation of scans in pregnancy and the increased availability of
genetic information. Hence, it is essential to consider what lessons can be learned.
Researchers and commentators have noted how increased knowledge, together with
potentially easy and routine access to such knowledge, can have profound inﬂuences
on how individuals see themselves, their medical risk, and their responsibilities. For
example, the very experience of pregnancy and motherhood can be profoundly
impacted [26]. The availability of genetic knowledge may also have weighty
ramiﬁcations for individuals, for family relationships, and for attitudes towards
responsibility in regard to reproduction [27, 28].
These issues are all relevant to questions about AI, which routinely uses massive
amounts of data, including medical information, enables the collection of much
personal data, and is used to facilitate the speedy production of both scientiﬁc and
personal information. Naïve assumptions about the value of scientiﬁc information
may not readily translate to understanding the value of the personal information for
the individuals concerned.
In Sect. 2.4, we looked at several examples of the use of AI, including some for
medical diagnosis, the use of machine learning to assist with the interpretation of
medical images, and the EDoN project, which aims to develop digital tools for the
early diagnosis of dementia. Consider now some further issues about the use of AI to
collect and interpret data. Many of the early signs of dementia can manifest as subtle

changes in behaviour, such as changes in one’s gait [29]. Likewise, indications that
dementia is progressing can be found in small behavioural and language changes
[30]. Hence, tracking technologies may pick these up when they are below the level
at which even a reasonably astute observer may notice them. There are multiple
implications for how people see themselves and understand such data, which need to
be understood as we process the implications of such technology on our lives [31].
106
3
AI, Philosophy of Technology, and Ethics
Exercise 6
Consider the implications of the production of knowledge about the link between
gait and a degenerative disease such as dementia, for the scientiﬁc community and
for individuals. Consider how you might think about the information collected from
a tracking device that you are using to measure your exercise and sporting goals, if it
became clear to you that this could be used to diagnose a progressive and serious
disease. Do your attitudes towards information collected for one purpose shift when
it can be used for a different purpose? Does this information now become ‘medical’
information? Does it make a difference to your attitude towards privacy?
The practice of medicine also serves as a clear example to illustrate the question
of identifying valid goals of technology, for although the concept of disease and
illness may seem clear enough in many cases, drawing a boundary between health
and disease is not always straightforward, and indeed, deﬁning health in its absence
is easier than providing a good account of what it is to live in full health [32]. These
issues again are particularly clearly illustrated in psychiatry and psychological
medicine, where the classiﬁcation of psychological illnesses is fraught with contro-
versy [33]. These issues have relevance to the question of transhumanism and human
enhancement, areas with clear links to AI to which we will brieﬂy consider in
Chap. 11. For something to count as an ‘enhancement’, it has to be better in some
respect, but how is this measured?
In an age where there is ‘an app for everything’, the goals at which the technol-
ogies of AI aim may not always be clear. This may be exacerbated by factors such as
intense marketing and advertising (which AI itself enables via techniques such as
targeted advertising), design features, and constant upgrades of much technology.
Furthermore, the very success of many technologies, especially AI, may generate
problems. The capacity to provide fast, cheap, and efﬁcient solutions to issues and to
generate vast amounts of data and information may be a two-edged sword.
The goals of technology If AI is attempting to enhance or replace human agency,
thought, and decision-making, then we have to ask some simple questions before we
can assess the technology. What counts as a genuine enhancement? The quest is
explicitly value-laden. In addition, if we are replacing humans, there are two parts to
the question: ﬁrst, is what is provided by the technology an adequate replacement?
This would involve both careful assessment of the technology and careful compar-
ison with human capabilities, as well as a full understanding of what task is being
undertaken. This is often not a straightforward matter, as many examples we shall
look at will illustrate. Second, why replace humans in the speciﬁc task at hand? And

even if a good reason can be offered, we have to ask who beneﬁts, and to assess any
costs and beneﬁts for the humans who are no longer doing the task.
3.3
A Brief Introduction to the Philosophy of Technology
107
Despair at the extent to which technology controls us, together with a view of
technological determinism, that the progress of technology is inevitable and that it
will be impossible to restrain it in anything other than temporary measures, is
tragically expressed in the so-called Unabomber Manifesto, Industrial Society and
Its Future by Ted Kaczynski, who engaged in a terrorism campaign organised from
his tiny cabin in Montana [34]. It is one of its tragedies that Kaczynski came to the
conclusion that it was necessary to murder and maim in his 17-year bombing
campaign to force people to take notice of his ideas, for there are many who have
also expressed overlapping and indeed similar views about the problems of technol-
ogy without advocating violent solutions.
3.3.5
Boundary Questions and Ethical Conundrums:
Technology, Metaphysics, Ontology, and Ethics
We have seen in this brief overview how the philosophy of technology raises
questions in metaphysics, concerning views on the fundamental nature of the
world, of humans, and of technology, including questions about ontology, which
were introduced in discussing the Indigenous AI position paper in Sect. 2.9. Many of
the details of such claims, and disputes between them, concern how we draw
boundaries between categories. These claims can help to bring into relief some of
the questions raised by AI today. One set of questions is whether AI does, or might,
erode any clean distinction between artefacts and humans, and whether and why this
might matter. We have seen already in our brief foray into history that things that
cross boundaries and confuse categories of being evoke fear and fascination. The
very idea of a monster is that of a hybrid being inhabiting the twilight realm between
two domains. Indeed, the very word ‘twilight’, frequently used to connote something
spooky, is exactly in that zone between two worlds. Recall Mori’s notion of the
uncanny valley introduced in Sect. 2.5.2 [35]. More recent reviews of empirical
evidence have found mixed results and a more nuanced understanding of when this
phenomenon might occur [36].
Exercise 7
Search online for photos and videos of robots of various kinds. Can you identify a
reaction of eeriness in any of them similar to Mori’s description of the uncanny
valley? Can you classify other robots as appealing, cute, etc.? Compare your
reactions to others if you are doing this in class.
How might knowing about the ‘uncanny valley’ impact your reactions to robots?
Does a phenomenon such as the uncanny valley apply to any other uses of AI?

108

AI, Philosophy of Technology, and Ethics
Exercise 8
Is concern about such a boundary phenomenon just a matter of being ‘spooked out’,
or something more substantive? Should we reject these ‘creepy’ feelings when
considering ethics? Outline reasons for and against.
Such boundary questions are often the most heated questions of value and ethics,
where the most confusing differences of opinion and debates between opponents
whose views seem to slide right past each other often occur. For some, it is simply a
fascinating question of technology whether AI might attain the status akin to living
beings. For others, it is a profoundly ethical question. Understanding that strong
views and puzzlement at the views of others often accompany such boundary
questions may not help to resolve them, but it does help to account for the intensity
of different positions and the frequent lack of progress in resolving disputes. The
development of ‘full autonomy’, however that is described, can perhaps approximate
having what Aristotle called an ‘inward cause’ and certainly projections ahead to
scenarios where some superintelligent artiﬁcial general intelligence ‘takes off’ and is
able to recursively self-improve would pass muster as having an inward cause. There
are many projections to a future AI that can reproduce itself, although some such
projections are poorly speciﬁed since the identity criteria of individuation may be
absent.
Purity and Danger: Mixing Linen and Wool
Among the many rules in the Hebrew Bible (the Old Testament), some of
those which have provoked the greatest perplexity involve prohibitions on
mixing different kinds of substances: not mixing linen and wool (Leviticus
19.19 and Deuteronomy 22.11), not cooking an animal in its mother’s milk
(Exodus 23.19, 34.26, Deuteronomy 14.21), or not planting two kinds of seed
together (Deuteronomy 22.9). Note that there is also provision for recognition
of the role of the marginals (e.g. in leaving the margins of cultivated ﬁelds for
the poor, Leviticus 19.9–10).
There are differences of opinion regarding the meaning and purpose of
these rules. They may seem like the same kind of rule which we regard as
ethical, such as rules against murder and theft. However, ethical rules are more
readily understood as relevant to the well-being of humans (and in some cases
animals), whereas these purity laws seem bafﬂing to many, or elicit a range of
diverse interpretations that leave many none the wiser. One broad way of
interpreting them is in terms of symbolically marking the cultural and linguis-
tic importance of maintaining clarity in a conceptual framework used for
describing and understanding the world, and hence of vital importance to
understanding the world view of the culture.
Purity thinking is pervasive in human culture and behaviour. The anthro-
pologist Mary Douglas is one person who has explored these concepts in her
classic study on dirt, Purity and Danger [37]. Dirt, Douglas concludes, is
(continued)

‘matter out of place’, although different individuals and different societies
have often very diverse views on what counts as dirt and of what level of
cleanliness is sufﬁcient.
3.3
A Brief Introduction to the Philosophy of Technology
109
Many have a ‘bafﬂed’ response to such purity rules. Such responses may go
along with personality differences characterised by thinkers such as Jonathan
Haidt. For some individuals, various forms of purity are a part of the set of
values from which moral beliefs are formed and justiﬁed, whereas others make
little or no reference to purity as a value (see also Sect. 7.2.4). It may be useful
to draw upon such ideas when considering certain questions in AI ethics, such
as attitudes to crossing boundaries between human and machine, and attitudes
to the kinds of work we want AI to do.
3.3.6
Some Implications for the Conduct of AI Ethics
If technology is instrumental, with ends speciﬁed externally to it, this is precisely one
reason why it is essential that those working outside of any ﬁeld of technology
should be able to have a say regarding its values. However, values can be implicit in
the ways in which technology attempts to achieve its goals. Technologists them-
selves are unlikely to be neutral agents serving only the goals of those who have
commissioned this or that piece of technology. Those working in any area are likely
to enter it at least in part because it aligns with their interests and values, and
immersion within a ﬁeld is likely to induct a person into explicit and implicit values.
Humans can become highly motivated towards purposes and chase goals that might
on reﬂection merit some critique.
This is relevant to ethical questions of technology, including AI, in several ways.
It suggests that those working on design should reﬂect on their goals and assump-
tions, which of course they may have a limited capacity to do within the remit of a
particular organisation with its own aims. The beneﬁts of a multidisciplinary and
diverse team to work on a design problem should be apparent here. The experience
of those working in other ﬁelds of professional ethics, and research within the social
sciences about ethical judgement, would suggest that those who belong to more than
one social group may have the perspective of a wider or different set of values and
priorities on which to draw, which may help to mitigate the insufﬁciently critical
pursuit of certain goals or of particular methods of achieving them [38]. This also
means that those from outside of the ﬁeld of technology entirely have a valid role in
assessment.
Collaboration and dialogue in ethics and technology A certain conundrum
arises. There is certainly a need for detailed technical expertise in addressing
questions in AI ethics. There is a need for close collaboration and understanding
between those with different viewpoints and roles. However, working in close
collaboration with those who are dedicated to the development of technology may
mean that one may lose a certain critical edge and acquire implicit values that impact

the design and appraisal of end goals. They may share a certain basic assumption
about certain values and goals. They may come to adopt certain views by the
familiarity of engaging with those involved in technological development. The
achievements of one’s colleagues can be exciting, and it may be hard to wish them
well with their endeavours while simultaneously subjecting them to radical critique.
Consider, for example, the case of human reproductive technologies. Those opposed
to practices such as gamete donation and research on human embryos, for whatever
reasons, may be unlikely to join any internal ethics committees where such practices
are assumed. A critic might consider that any examination of ethics in such a context
would be merely ﬁddling with details.
110

AI, Philosophy of Technology, and Ethics
AI technology is heavily reliant on corporate resources and business practices.
Universities and other institutions are in a relationship of dependency with big tech,
creating many conﬂicts of interest in a complex web of relationships [39]. This then
speaks to the necessity for a mixed economy of voices in AI ethics (or indeed in any
area of technology), including views of more severe critics and voices from civil
society groups. It also alerts us to the perpetual question in ethics of knowing and
understanding our own values and motivations.
3.4
Technology and Attitudes Towards Nature
Summary
Attitudes towards nature are often deeply felt and can have profound implications for
how we view technology and its uses and abuses. Likewise, developments in both
science and technology can in turn inﬂuence how we think of nature. Attitudes
towards technology and towards the place of humans in the world are often shaped
by an imagined time or golden age without the ills of technology. Large cultural
differences abound in this area, which we cannot cover in full.
We have seen that attempts to explain and understand technology make frequent
reference to the natural world. Different ways of understanding the natural realm and
of how it is or is not differentiated from the realm of human activity will impact upon
how technology is understood and assessed. Hence, it will be illuminating to
consider the cultural, philosophical, and often religious worldviews that shape
attitudes to nature, attitudes that are often assumed and implicit and yet that can
play such an inﬂuential role in forming value judgements. The boundary between the
natural and the artiﬁcial is often charged with meaning.
A two-way process Just as attitudes towards nature help shape views of science and
technology, likewise developments in science and technology inﬂuence how we
think of nature. Landscapes we think of as ‘natural’ may be shaped by centuries of
human habitation, agriculture, and hunting. The growth in scientiﬁc understanding
of the human body and of disease has had a profound impact upon our understanding
of the origins of ill health and of attitudes towards its cause and our potential powers

to heal and what bodily experiences and conditions are ‘natural’, to be endured or
overcome. The underlying models with which we think of nature are also inﬂuenced
by developments in science and technology, in ways that might mean we are nudged
towards thinking that contemporary technologies are in harmony with nature. For
example, William Paley (1743–1805) famously argued that the world had been
designed by God, but for our purposes, note the analogy he used: that of a clock
[40]. Of course, he was not pointing to the ways in which wind-up clocks fail to keep
time accurately. He was using an analogy of the universe as a whole as if it worked
mechanically, according to an ordered and regular mechanism, based upon the
technology of the day. Likewise, currently, in the age of computing, the brain is
sometimes modelled as a computer, and physics may be modelled in terms of
information.
3.4
Technology and Attitudes Towards Nature
111
The scientiﬁc method itself makes certain assumptions about the natural world,
that it follows law-like regularities, and in addition, that these regularities can be
described and understood by us using reason and mathematics. Without this assump-
tion, we might well see scientiﬁc journal articles end by declaring, ‘let’s face it, it’s
just a mystery’, and all research in the area coming to a halt. To assume we can
understand the world scientiﬁcally is a rather bold assumption, especially for those
with a materialist bent who view humans as nothing other than the products of a
series of random events in the course of evolution. One can marvel at this, wondering
what it was about our evolutionary origins that necessitated the human brain to
evolve in ways that enabled us to understand relativity theory, advanced mathemat-
ics, and string theory. (Well, that enabled some of us understand these things!)
However, this assumption is not universally held.
Regularity, design, and beauty The assumption that we will be able to understand
the regularities of nature could simply be a heuristic device, a pragmatic guiding
assumption making science and technology possible, justiﬁed by their considerable
success. However, often, although again not universally, many cultures and world-
views have considered that the regularities of the universe speak to a design put in
there by some intelligence. Alongside the wish to explain the order we apparently
see in the world, it is commonly a wish to explain its perceived beauty. Indeed, many
hard-headed scientists believe that the regularities and patterns they observe are part
and parcel of this beauty, and there is a debate about whether the beauty of a
scientiﬁc or mathematical theory is indeed any indicator of its truth [41].
Human ingenuity being what it is, philosophers and theologians have come up
with every conceivable variation on such a claim, including ideas that the creator of
the universe set it going and left it, or that the creator is a necessary part of its
maintenance, or that the creator is not bound by the regularities he (or whatever the
correct pronoun is) produced and can intervene to amend these at will.
We need not concern ourselves here with the details, other than to observe the link
with answers to the question: is the universe good, bad, a mixture, or just neutral?
We see deeply held and often contrasting attitudes to the world around us, many of
them marked with expressions of awe. John Ruskin, among others, wrote eloquently

of the concept of the sublime in response to great structures of nature that seem to
dwarf mere mortals [42]; the poet Alfred, Lord Tennyson wrote of ‘nature, red in
tooth and claw’ [43]; and the poet and artist William Blake wrote of the ‘Tyger,
tyger, burning bright, in the forest of the night, what immortal hand or eye, could
frame thy fearful symmetry’, yet notes stark contrasts in nature when he writes, ‘Did
he who made the lamb make thee?’ [44]. The Romantics often praised nature in
conscious opposition to what they saw as an overly rational approach to the world
but nonetheless often found not just majesty but terror [45]. Very varying attitudes
towards nature are found in different individuals and at different times: for example,
Lao Tzu wrote, ‘Nature does not hurry, yet everything is accomplished’ [46], which
contrasts strongly with the fear and anxiety expressed by others. However, what
seems constant is some attribution of value, whether of mystery, awe, terror, or hope
to nature.

AI, Philosophy of Technology, and Ethics
Such attitudes of value towards the natural world are frequently present even in
those who profess no religion and consider their worldview entirely based on reason
and science. For some, these values arise from objective features of the world itself;
for others, they are based entirely upon human assessment. However, whatever their
origin, these attitudes will profoundly inﬂuence how we judge human’s use of
technology to make use of the world’s resources and to alter the world. This often
assumes that the world can be improved via the use of technology. Teleological
views of the world understand it as striving to complete or fulﬁl some purpose. Will
nature be enough, or does it need assistance from us in completing this purpose?
Surprisingly, perhaps, there are those within AI who appear to take a teleological
view and who see humanity as having a critical role in advancing the purpose of the
universe. We will examine such views in Chap. 11.
A time and place in nature without technology? Even for those who consider
technology to have an important place, it is common for there to be cultural myths
about some ‘golden age’ where humans live in harmony with nature, technology was
scarce or absent, and life was provided for abundantly without the need for labour.
The Garden of Eden, which the ﬁrst humans, Adam and Eve, inhabited in plentiful
abundance before being expelled for breaking God’s commands, is an obvious
example. The ancient Greeks likewise had similar visions. Empedocles describes a
time when humans were free from toil, there was abundant fruit, and all the animals
were tame. It was human’s slaughter of animals that caused our fallen state and the
destruction of this idyllic world. The Taoist Chuang Tzu lamented the passing of a
virtuous age where ‘men lived in common with the birds and beasts’ in the fourth
century BCE. A Cherokee myth held that humanity lived once in perfect harmony
not with just animals but also with plants, which could speak.
There is also often a vision of a future state of peace towards which we strive. The
book of Isaiah looks forward to a ‘peaceable Kingdom’, when ‘The wolf also shall
dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf and the
young lion and the fatling together; and a little child shall lead them’ (Isaiah 11:6)
[47]. Such visions of a future state can also be relevant in considering visions of
futurologists in imagining AI, to which we shall return. There are also visions of

space outside the reach of technology, in notions of the wild and of wilderness as a
space left over on our planet, and indeed in space, free from the impact of humanity.
Many poets and writers, such as Thoreau, Emerson, the romantic poets, and even
John Stuart Mill, have written of the need for time within nature [48–50]. It is
interesting to consider whether some reservations about AI derive from its global and
sometimes seemingly totalising impact on the planet [3].
3.4
Technology and Attitudes Towards Nature
113
Despotic ruler or kindly dominion? Within contemporary debates about technol-
ogy, including within debates about the ethics and social and political impact of AI,
we can see two very contrasting poles, which echo and repeat enduring divisions and
controversies: the view of humanity as despot and despoiler of nature versus the
view of humanity as caretaker of nature. It has often been claimed that Western
attitudes of mastery over nature that have led to its despoilment stem from Genesis 1:
26, where God makes humanity in his own image and gives them dominion over all
creatures, then later in Genesis 2:20, Adam, the ﬁrst man, named all the living
creatures. This has been charged with being the root source of Western attitudes of
domination of nature and an assumption that nature is there for our total control and
use, leading up to our current problems with the environment and industrialisation.
However, it has been closely argued that the interpretation implying that humans
were given despotic, absolute rule over nature ignores much textual and other
evidence that humanity was intended to govern nature with care and act as a guardian
or good shepherd. For instance, it is clear that God pronounced the earth and its
inhabitants to be ‘good’ before humans were created. John Passmore provides a
nuanced discussion in his book, Man’s Responsibility for Nature, although many
more voices and opinions have been added to these debates in recent decades
[51]. Nonetheless, acting as if we are entitled to use nature as we see ﬁt is indeed
common.
The suggestion that humanity is somehow a ruler over nature presents us with the
question of what our place in the natural world is, and indeed, what our nature as
humans is. This is a critical issue for questions of AI ethics and will be discussed
further in Chap. 5.
Nature, Medicine, and Technology
It is noticeable that often new technology is justiﬁed in ﬁrst use through
potential application in medicine, or that its application in medicine is
highlighted as a justifying beneﬁt. For example, the company Neuralink is
developing a broad bandwidth brain interface which expresses the hope that
the technology will enable the expansion of how we interact with each other,
the world, and ourselves, but which aims at initial application in people with
paralysis
to
help
them
regain
independence
in
communication
and
expression [52].

AI, Philosophy of Technology, and Ethics
The use of machine learning in neural rendering technology to create
‘digital humans’, which realistically reproduce particular human beings, their
mannerisms, and voice, is being developed by the MOTUS lab (motuslab.org),
a part of the University of Sydney and a part of the Disruption Research
Group. It is being presented as a means of improving quality of life for
survivors of serious strokes, enabling them to interact with others via a digital
version which represents their appearance and ability to speak prior to the
stroke [53]. However, there are multiple potential other applications, such as
‘digital de-aging’.
Within medicine itself, new, experimental, and perhaps risky techniques are
often justiﬁed by reference to ‘the desperate case’ [54], and there is a sense in
which any use of technology regarding ill health can be seen to be urgent, or of
especially great importance, in comparison to most other uses. The question
will arise often if these worthy medical uses are the slippery slope to wider
acceptance of a technology which might otherwise have received a less
enthusiastic reception.
However, perhaps another reason for the readiness to consider new tech-
nologies within a medical context comes from the very way in which we think
of health and disease. A teleological view of nature sees it as striving in some
way towards certain ends. It is virtually impossible to talk of biology without
reference to functioning. In the realm of living organisms, we then see many
examples of functioning which do not ﬁt the normal developmental picture,
and which may shorten the lifespan and overall functioning of the organism.
Some worldviews give humans as having some role in helping to bring
about the proper journey of the world to its full potential. The area of medicine,
and human intervention to improve health and restore full functioning, seems
one where the role of technologies of one sort or another seems ideally suited
not just from a moral and compassionate standpoint, but conceptually, in
ﬁtting with some of the fundamental ways in which we understand biology.
Exercise 9
Neuralink claims that it is pushing at the boundaries of engineering and states that its
ﬁrst goal is to enable independence for people suffering from paralysis by enabling
communication and interaction with technology via interfaces implanted into the
brain [55]. Given the current state of ethics for research on human subjects, it is in
fact hard to know how it could ever get permission to implant one of its devices into
the brain of a healthy volunteer. Do you think a healthy volunteer should be allowed
to consent to such an intervention? Are there any potential dangers of a ‘slippery
slope’ from the use of this technology from severe medical cases to wider use?

3.5
The Implicit Values of Technology
Summary
This section draws out some of the implicit values commonly attributed to technol-
ogy. These will form a backdrop to many of the comparisons made between human
and machine intelligence. These include assumptions about our capacity to know the
world and to control the world; the assumption that speed is a prima facie good;
assumptions concerning the nature and value of efﬁciency; assumptions about the
value of consistency and uniformity; and assumptions about the neutrality of
technology.
We have seen how some thinkers, such as Plato, considered that technology
(craftwork) attempts to mimic nature, to apply the lessons of nature in places
where nature itself has not used them, and to suit our purposes, perhaps to take
powers inherent in nature and ‘ramp them up’, as it were. It is certainly the case that
technology uses the ﬁndings of science about how the world works. Technology is
often concerned with improving human performance, for example, by extending our
reach, our strength, our stamina, or our speed. Different technologies used in
different instances will of course have particular advantages over humans, and in
assessing technologies and their use, we need to assess what is gained and what
is lost.
However, the overtly stated purposes and advantages of using technology in
speciﬁc instances may not capture the whole picture. The assessment of technology
must involve looking at both intended and unintended impacts. There are often
implicit or assumed values in the use of technology and sometimes an assumption
that technology, per se, will improve upon things—the ‘technological ﬁx’ assump-
tion we looked at in Sect. 3.3.4. Articulating these assumptions can be illuminating.
Focusing on the advantages of technology can help to ensure that we do not lose
sight of what might be lost by marginalising or excluding the use of humans.
Knowledge: First, we have already considered the assumption that we can in fact
know the world, and perhaps that we can know it in full. The value of knowledge
may seem so obvious that it can be hard to articulate why we value it, other than
as a means to enable us to achieve other goals. However, it’s a driving assumption
of much AI in particular, not just that knowledge is good, but that more knowl-
edge is better. We consider this further at various points in the book.
Control: Again, we have already seen that technology is grounded on an assumption
that control of the world is possible, but it is where it leads that controversies
arise: that control is good, that more control the better, that the world is imperfect,
and that it is a human moral imperative to improve it.
Speed: It is often assumed that technology improves upon human performance by
processing more data, getting tasks completed faster, and so on. This is undoubt-
edly a chief advantage of much technology in general and of AI in particular,
especially in regard to processing vast amounts of data. The quest for speed in
tech does not apply in all cases: I have never seen any evidence that people want

116

AI, Philosophy of Technology, and Ethics
sex robots in order to be able to have sex extremely quickly, although humans
never cease to surprise me so I could be mistaken. However, if the sex robot
example is laughingly obvious as soon as it is pointed out, there are other tasks
where it may not be so obvious. These include many examples of human contact.
For instance, it has been suggested that advanced robots could work as care
assistants in tasks such as delivering medicines on a hospital ward, and the
COVID-19 pandemic had led to an increase in such suggestions [56]. However,
although there may be some advantages to the completion of necessary tasks, for
the patients, such instances provide a point of human contact at a vulnerable time
of their lives. So speed may be a value, but perhaps not be the only value to
consider.
Speed, Technology, and Nursing Care
Hospital wards are busy places where many staff with multiple roles are
simultaneously performing tasks for a large number of different patients
with varying needs. There are targets to be met, such as completing medication
rounds, delivering food, and blood pressure and other checks. Staff are under
pressure to meet certain deadlines and to keep records of certain tasks and
events, such as the necessity of recording adverse events such as falls.
There is great interest in the contribution of technology to improve the
efﬁciency of how hospital wards are run. However, the point of view of the
patient may be rather different. This may be especially the case for patients
who have any difﬁculties in communicating or in understanding and
interpreting what is expected of them, as hospital patients. A meal ‘efﬁciently
delivered’ may be one aspiration; to a patient, it may be a chance for a brief
chat and some interaction with the person delivering it. We considered in
Chap. 2 the example of a robot assistant for an elderly person who might help
with reminders about medication. Such tasks are often envisaged as if it has
more in common with putting a coin in a slot machine, than in helping or
persuading another human being to have sufﬁcient trust to place a pharma-
ceutical product in their mouths and swallow [57]. We consider such issues
again in Chap. 10 in considering the future of work.
Likewise, sometimes the speed at which tasks are performed can itself produce
new issues. The speed at which data can be processed can provide us with a weight
of information that can be used to achieve good or ill effects. We can readily grasp
some of the issues by slightly altering the previous sentence: the speed at which data
can be processed can provide them with a weight of information that can be used to
achieve good or ill effects. So much depends upon who ‘they’ are. Likewise, the
expectation that things we want will be delivered immediately may have advantages,
of course, but could have a corrosive impact on our personalities. Might we become
petty tyrant despots, a world of mini-aristocrats clicking their ﬁngers and expecting
the world to jump?

3.5
The Implicit Values of Technology
117
Exercise 10
Consider how technologies that you use in everyday life—whether out of choice or
necessity—speed up various tasks. Consider the pros and cons and any wider effects
of increasing expectations of speed.
Time, Technology, Humans, and the Importance of Rhythms
A major reason for the use of technology is its impact on time. It can enable
things to be done faster and often enables work and other tasks to be performed
with less attention to the clock and the rhythms of the working day. You can
write an email at 5.30 p.m., and set it to send at 6.45 a.m. the next day, to fool
your boss into believing that you start work early. One reason for deploying
such tricks is indeed in response to the demand to be always ‘on’. Whatever
the pluses and minuses, technology’s operation can be quite counter to the
rhythms of human life. The impact of AI on the interactions and rhythms of
our lives may have profound implications. We follow rhythms of varying
types, physical, biological, and cultural: those set by the seasons, by our
circadian rhythms, and by our culture and its traditions.
The study of rhythms may add an interesting dimension to studies of
technology. Various philosophers and sociologists have investigated them,
perhaps
the
best
known
being
Henri
Lefebvre
in
his
work
Rhythmanalysis [58].
Efﬁciency The notion of speed quickly leads us to the notion of efﬁciency. We may
use technology because we assume it’s more efﬁcient. Several issues are raised here.
First, it is often not more efﬁcient to use technology for speciﬁc tasks, but we can
easily get so tied up with the habitual use of technology we forget that some tasks are
faster and easier without it. A simple example: have you ever struggled with a
printing problem, even something as simple as sorting out jammed paper, to print out
a message for the ofﬁce notice board that would have taken 20 s to write out by hand?
Think of some examples for yourself over the next few days.
Second, what precisely do we mean by efﬁciency? It is usually deﬁned as the
ability to do something without wasting materials, time, or effort. Hence, there will
be a trade-off between these in assessing efﬁciency. The time used may not be one’s
own, and the materials and energy wasted may be out of sight. Economic measures
of efﬁciency often dominate, even in instances where this skews values, such as in
healthcare or the arts [59]. The measure of efﬁciency also requires that the outputs
are also given a measure so that comparisons are possible. However, this poses
considerable value problems that manifest in a variety of ways. For example, the
efﬁciency of healthcare may be measured in terms of quality adjusted life-years
(QALYS), a controversial and complex issue [60]. Efﬁciently distributing resources
may lead to some decisions that appear inhumane.

118
3
AI, Philosophy of Technology, and Ethics
Third, who values efﬁciency in particular contexts, and why? A task can be done
efﬁciently and thus valued by some, but the perspective of others may differ. Take
the example above of the delivery of medicines. Efﬁciency in admitting someone to
hospital when needed, diagnosing a condition, and prescribing treatment is
extremely valuable from the point of view of the hospital, the staff, and the patients.
Efﬁciency in completing nursing and care tasks is also extremely valuable from the
point of view of hospital administrators. The staff may have mixed views: efﬁciency
targets may be a source of satisfaction but also of stress in the rush to complete and in
explanations of any failures. A patient, likewise, may value efﬁciently being brought
a meal but not value that the person bringing it immediately rushes off to the next
patient.
Consistency and uniformity These can be a great beneﬁt of technology. However,
again, it’s not necessarily what we want. The consistency in the mass production of
objects since the dawn of the Industrial Revolution has served values such as safety
and reliability. However, it has highlighted the loss of the personal, the idiosyncratic,
and the found. One prediction of the increase in the automation of work is that there
will be a rise in jobs involving hand-made and personalised objects.
There is also a potential downside of consistency and uniformity in using
technologies such as AI in information processing and knowledge discovery. One
advantage can be uniformity across a wide system. However, suppose that there is an
error in the system. The very difference of opinion and outcome that may arise with
human shortcomings may be a virtue in some circumstances in providing a way of
correcting errors. Indeed, this can be one very good reason to resist the development
of any universal code or guidance on ethics for AI. We may simply be universally
wrong.
An example: AI is being developed which will automatically translate accents for
use in situations such as with call centre workers [61]. There is an obvious advantage
in ensuring that a person’s speech and accent can be clearly understood over the
phone. However, critics point out that the slightly robotic voice that is produced
using this AI makes the speaker sound like a white American [62]. A clearer example
of the dominance of American culture within part of the technology world and the
imposition of cultural uniformity with the aid of AI is hard to ﬁnd. Likewise,
automatic editing tools may impose subtleties of American usage onto the English
language, which has rich and varying forms in different parts of the world, and may
eliminate from texts words and phrases which are formally redundant but were
placed for emphasis, prioritising a purely formalistic notion of meaning over a
more human-centred form of communication.

Technology and Perceived Standards of Excellence: A True Story
Not so long ago, I was due to give a presentation on AI ethics at a major
technology event. I was asked to submit my PowerPoint slides in advance.
One of the points I wished to make concerned how technology may enable us
to do certain things ‘better’ than before, but in ways that introduce standards of
‘excellence’ without due thought to our original aims, standards which may be
entirely unnecessary. I intended to illustrate this with the very example of
PowerPoint itself. The PowerPoint presentations at this technology conference
were truly stunning. Many must have taken considerable effort. However, did
this always truly add anything? My slides were intentionally sparse, and I
inserted a slide of a hand-drawn picture of a computer, to make the point that in
this context, a rough hand-drawing does the job just ﬁne.
When I clicked onto the relevant slide, I discovered that the technicians had
diligently removed the slide of my own sloppy hand-drawn computer and
replaced it with a slide of a perfectly accurate, beautifully neat, computer-
drawn computer. Just exactly what I didn’t need.
Neutrality Closely linked to qualities of consistency and uniformity, the use of
technologies such as AI may have the advantage over humans of a certain neutrality,
perhaps captured under the term ‘objectivity’, or the like: the use of AI may be
thought to get around human failings such as slips of concentration and emotional
involvement and bias. Of course, AI can also be very biased, as has already been
mentioned (Sect. 2.4.3). A computerised system can follow rules according to set
inputs. However, this is precisely one of the problems in certain settings where
individual discretion and human judgement may be needed for anomalous cases
where ‘the exception proves the rule’. It is a general problem in any bureaucratic
system, but it is certainly possible that the assumption that an AI-driven system will
be an improvement on the fallibility of humans may produce not fewer problems but
simply a different set of problems. Questions related to these issues recur frequently
in AI ethics.
Technology and us Some of the implicit values of technology and ways of thinking
may be about the general models used to conceptualise the world: How our use of
technology may shape how we think both of technology and of ourselves. We have
already seen how developments in science and technology can impact how we
understand the world at large. Might this happen to how we see ourselves?
Joseph Weizenbaum, the computer scientist behind the Eliza project, remarked
that those whose daily lives consist of being slaves to machines start to believe that
humans themselves are also machines [63]. However, is this process always a
one-way ticket to dehumanisation?
There are fascinating questions of feedback loops between how we value tech-
nology and how we value what it is that technology substitutes or mimics. Jared

Lanier has been at the forefront of developing virtual reality. He points out that when
technologies such as photography and sound and video recordings ﬁrst came along,
people judged them to be as realistic as the original, in ways that we now would ﬁnd
just bizarre—the old recordings seem so primitive [64]. For example, people would
purchase photographs of people who roughly resembled their loved ones, using a
technologically produced image of the total stranger as a proxy for a portrait of some
they knew in real life. He opines that the use of such technologies, including virtual
reality, can enhance our appreciation of the ‘real thing’ and that the best part of
virtual reality is returning to the real world. We can now see the differences between
photography and the same image seen through our own eyes and perhaps gain a
deeper appreciation for both, including ourselves and each other. Likewise, perhaps
it is in part the uniformity of production that has enhanced appreciation for the
unique stamp of each human voice, of hand-made artefacts from natural materials,
and so on.
120

AI, Philosophy of Technology, and Ethics
We can think of much of this under the heading of ‘texture’. Computer graphics
designers are paying much attention to producing texture in the ﬂat images we see on
the screen. The texture of real life may be calling us. We will consider later some
implications of imagining the human mind on the model of a computer.
Exercise 11
Find an example of a proposal to use AI to supplement or replace a human, and try to
do as full a checklist as possible of the ways in which it is explicitly stated to be
better and ways in which it is implicitly assumed to be better.
3.6
Communication Through New Technologies
Summary
Communication technologies have been with us for some time, but the capacities of
AI are increasing their capabilities, and they are an increasingly necessary part of
daily and economic life. Communication is an activity with inherently ethical
dimensions for the nature and qualities of our relationships and for the nature and
quality of the information and knowledge we transmit and possess. Here, we look at
how technologies may change the relationship of the reader and the writer, the
capacity for individuals to control how the world sees them, and the direction and
manner of our attention. We look at work by Walter Benjamin, Marshall McLuhan,
and Erving Goffman for ideas we can apply to AI.
3.6.1
AI and Communication Technologies
The AI technologies we are considering exhibit a multiplicity of facets. Some of the
most important ethical questions concern how AI is used in communication, whether
in personal communication, in the media, or as a means of accessing knowledge

about the world. This is a two-way process, since we, the users, communicate via
such technologies, and information about us is collected and analysed by (often
unknown) others. The surveillance elements of these technologies can also be seen
as a form of communication, albeit a degraded and lop-sided one. Both the form of
technology and its technical capabilities and social use must be understood together
in any effort to comprehend and respond to such complex phenomena.
3.6
Communication Through New Technologies
121
Signiﬁcant changes in communication technologies over the centuries have had
profound and lasting impacts on society and culture. We have noted Socrates’ views
on the signiﬁcance of writing and have already mentioned in passing the printing
press. This played a role in social, intellectual, and religious developments, which
can with considerable justiﬁcation be described as transformative. The printing press
allowed for the ready reproduction of ideas and pictures, an ability that only
increased with mechanisation and which is now seemingly limitless but also fragile
in signiﬁcant ways. The reproduction and distribution of ideas and images online is
in at least some respects parallel to the reproduction and distribution of goods made
possible by the Industrial Revolution. It is therefore instructive to reﬂect on what
extent we can learn from the past and from prior reﬂections on such developments.
Are the changes we are seeing something new, or are they the same old same old?
Can we gain any insights by seeing current technologies through the kinds of
questions and concerns raised by past technologies?
Communication as an inherently ethical question Communication is partly an
ethical issue because of the manner in which it gives rise to speciﬁc problems.
Indeed, information technologies give rise to many of these: intellectual property
rights, plagiarism, deep fakes, online misinformation, doxing, pile-on harassment,
online privacy and anonymity, digital passports, and the list goes on. Relevant
aspects of AI that produce such issues include the speed at which communication
can occur, its reach, the capacity to process information, the capacity for encryption
and conversely for hacking, the capacity to conceal and to reveal identities, the
possibility of dissimulation and fakery, and opportunities for control and its loss.
However, aside from the necessity of considering speciﬁc issues, the impact of
technological changes on communication is also an ethical issue for the fundamental
reason that ethics intimately concerns relationships between people and thus pre-
supposes the existence and quality of channels of communication. Hence, changes in
the manner of communication can potentially alter the entire shape of ethical
questions and responses. The reach and impact of such changes in communicative
possibility are also likely to have ramiﬁcations that extend far beyond a merely
formal account of the technical possibilities [65, 66].
3.6.2
The Reproduction of Ideas and Images
The study of communications in general and of communication in the Internet age
and with the assistance of AI in particular is a ﬁeld in its own right. Here, we look at

some signiﬁcant work examining the impact of technologies on the communication
of ideas and images, beginning with Walter Benjamin’s 1936 essay, The Work of Art
in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction [67]. This is taken as an example of a
potential source of inspiration and ideas for reﬂecting on the ethical issues with
which we are concerned. It is also chosen to enable readers to reﬂect on how past
ideas—the work is over 80 years old now and technology has developed consider-
ably since—may have considerable relevance to our concerns.
122
3
AI, Philosophy of Technology, and Ethics
Benjamin was a philosopher and critical theorist whose work continues to be
inﬂuential. His work has signiﬁcance beyond what might formally be thought of as
‘works of art’ and is of signiﬁcance in the online world and in relation to AI for both
images and text. Many have commented on the signiﬁcance of his work for the
current age of digital reproduction. Our remarks here can only be very introductory.
For our purposes, we must also consider how the capabilities of AI may add to and
further complexify the question of reproduction.
Benjamin argues that with reproduction, the work of art is placed outside of its
original context of tradition (which is not to say something static, since traditions
change). Before the possibility of easy reproduction, works of art had what Benjamin
calls an ‘aura’, and a notion of the ‘genuine’ work of art was linked to the capacity to
trace the physical and lines of ownership. Ready reproduction dislocates context and
allows for greater autonomy of the reproduction. When reproduction of art
undermined the concept of the genuine work of art, its social functions came to be
underpinned by politics.
Changing relationships between parties Communication concerns more than one
party, and the possibilities for the nature of the relationship between those parties can
permit, constrain, and shape the nature of that communication. Benjamin’s discus-
sion of the role of the actor in ﬁlm as distinct from the theatre notes how in the theatre
the actor is presenting to a particular audience in the present. However, in ﬁlm, the
actor portrays him- or herself to the camera and is conscious of an audience as the
market for the ﬁlm, which is not present and which exists only in the future, but in
multiple possible futures and places. The impact of space and of time matters: time is
disrupted and becomes discontinuous. The actor has no immediate feedback from an
audience in the form of an embodied presence. Recall the discussion of the relevance
of locality in Sect. 2.9. Consider what changes to relationships between parties have
become possible with the different forms of communication made possible using
AI. I am reminded of the sheer misery of suddenly being forced to record online
videos, minus any audience of students, at the start of the pandemic.
Erving Goffman: The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life
The inﬂuential sociologist Erving Goffman’s classic work studied how we
present ourselves to the world when we are being observed by others, and the
different contexts of how we do so [68]. This should be an immediately
familiar issue to any honest reader. Around the world, people tidy up for
(continued)

guests, wear different clothes, and adopt different manners for formal
occasions.
3.6
Communication Through New Technologies
123
Goffman developed the useful distinction between front stage and back
stage which can apply in many social settings. Back stage one can be more
relaxed and show a different persona to that which is shown front stage. There
are many versions of this. In the staff room, teachers may moan about their
most annoying pupils. When having guests for dinner, the cook may surrep-
titiously signal to the family not to ask for second helpings if they suddenly
realise there is not enough. In the ladies’ rest room, a woman may hurriedly
use safety pins to repair a tear in her skirt, and so on.
Exercise 12
Consider how the possibilities for showing oneself to the world and of being
monitored and subjected to surveillance, which are being created by technologies
which use AI, may be altering the places in virtual reality and ‘real’ reality which
count as front and back stage, and how this might impact how we present ourselves.
What aspects of the technology and its deployment are relevant to any such changes?
Is a distinction between ‘front stage’ and ‘back stage’ being eroded in some places?
(We will look at the topic of surveillance again in later chapters.)
Consider the MOTUS technology mentioned in Sect. 3.4, which would enable
someone to present a digital version of themselves online. How might this change
the expected standards of beauty and appearance? Consider the projected use for
stroke survivors. Consider how this might beneﬁt patients and consider the possi-
bility that it might reinforce stigma against people living with disabilities.
Furthermore, the possibility for scrutiny of the actor changes with the introduc-
tion of photography. Film requires that the actor has to consider how to present to the
camera and how the camera is used in return to present the world. Film also allows
for increasingly detailed perception of the optical and auditory world. The camera
increases our ability to scrutinise the behaviour of others, and they of us, showing us
what Benjamin calls the ‘optical unconscious’, to mirror the ways in which psycho-
analysis had made us aware of the unconscious aspects of our behaviours that may
give away more than we intended. Consider how AI may have further increased such
possibilities for the scrutiny and observation of the world, including of ourselves.
The roles of reader and of writer The distinction between the writer and the
reader also changes with mechanical reproduction. In previous times, there were a
small number of writers with thousands of readers. As printed material increased and
the number of outlets increased, increasing numbers could publish in print, and the
fundamental character of the divide between reader and writer changed [67, p. 23].
The online world is manifestly making further changes, but what these are and what
the social, cultural, and ethical ramiﬁcations are is far from clear and indeed is a
subject receiving considerable attention. The affordances of the technologies and the

capacity for control by technology companies, of regulation by governments, and of
interactions between readers and writers online are all part of this mix.

AI, Philosophy of Technology, and Ethics
Walter Benjamin’s work can suggest some starting points for analysing how the
ﬂow of images and ideas is impacted by modern communication technologies,
including the use of AI. In addition to giving rise to discrete and concrete issues,
technological changes that impact how one sees oneself, how one is seen by others,
how words and images are received and responded to will impact matters at the very
heart of what is at issue in ethics—relations between the self and other, how our
messages are understood, and lines of responsibility and accountability.
Exercise 13: Food for Thought
Some ideas to take forward in considering the impact of AI on how we communicate
with each other and how we receive information about the world include the
following:
Context and its loss: is this occurring, and how, and how can meanings be
attributed and understood outside of their original context?
The presentation of the self to the world: how does AI facilitate the possibilities of
how we present to the world, and how much does it constrain it?
How much does the increases in the possibility of scrutiny using AI impinge on
us and our relationships with others?
3.6.3
Artiﬁcial Intelligence as a Medium
Marshall McLuhan’s phrase ‘The medium is the message’ arises from a body of
work of cultural criticism that explores how the form of media impacts the ideas that
are communicated, looking at technical developments in the electronic age [69]. As
such, it can likewise be mined for suggestions of questions to ask concerning the
impact of AI and online communication today. First published in the 1960s, and thus
referring to technologies now over half a century old, once again one of the things to
take away from this work is how many of the questions we ask today in relation to AI
and to online communication were already being asked in relation to technologies
which may strike us as comically primitive such as the Xerox machine. It is a
salutary reminder that even so many decades ago, and in response to technology
that now seems almost antique, McLuhan described electronic devices as providing
lifelong surveillance and presenting dilemmas for privacy and the claims of society
for information about us [70, p. 12]. He noted that the electrically computerised
dossier bank not only threatens privacy by serving as a memory bank that is open
and is not erased; there is no redemption from past mistakes and no forgiveness.
Space, time, and attention The impact of electronic circuitry on time and space is
also noted, which provides information instantly and from all corners of the earth
[70, p. 16]. Communication and electronic technologies have a worldwide impact,
creating a global village. This raises an issue that is both of prime importance in

considering technologies today and, as we shall see in more detail later, critical to
understanding ethics: attention. TV demands our attention. Now, of course, old
fashioned TV has less of our attention, and rather more individually tailored material
assails us, much of which is purposefully designed to attract our attention using
techniques of behavioural psychology. As we will also explore in more detail in later
chapters, attention is a key question in ethical judgement and perception. You can’t
respond to something you have not even noticed. Since the world is full of possi-
bilities for thought and for action, the question of where the focus of our attention
lies is critical. We know too much about each other and can no longer avoid the
claims of certain previously ignored minorities [70, p. 24].
3.7
Key Points
125
McLuhan claims that electric circuitry is an extension of our nervous system [70,
p. 41], an interesting claim regarding the boundaries of ourselves that is echoed by
some more contemporary views in philosophy of mind, which we will mention in
Chap. 7. Media alters the ways in which we perceive the world and which senses
dominate. Changes in media can impact upon how the viewer or consumer of media
is placed in relation to it, and how detached or involved they are with the material.
Electronic media is instant and involves all of us. This is one feature that has altered
since McLuhan wrote. For those of you too young to remember, television
programmes were rarely repeated, appeared at set times, and hence formed moments
of a certain social unity and shared attention. Key shared cultural events include the
coronation of Elizabeth II in 1953, which was the ﬁrst televised coronation of a
British monarch, the televised Kennedy election in 1960, and the Apollo 11 moon
landings in 1969. Our family crammed into the local school hall with hundreds of
other families to watch the moon landing, the ﬁrst ever all-night broadcast from the
BBC [71]. Such events had a great sense of excitement and community.
It is interesting to consider how changes in accessing information, including
changes such as deep fakes and the collection of information regarding the viewers,
have altered the lines of any shared sense of community and of awareness of the
world. The idea of seeing the world from a ﬁxed perspective may no longer be
appropriate.
Question
Can the very form of technology help to shape what ethical issues come to our
attention, and how they are presented? Recall the question of the importance of
relationships in considering ethical questions presented to us by AI.
3.7
Key Points
Attitudes towards technology can shape how key questions in AI ethics are under-
stood, such as questions concerning how we understand the limits of human
achievement and how we attribute agency to humans and to machines.
Other questions concerning boundaries and how we classify and categorise the
world are also critical for understanding some central questions in AI ethics.

AI, Philosophy of Technology, and Ethics
We can easily think of technology as ‘new’, but it has always been a feature of
human life, and ancient philosophers debated issues in the philosophy of technology
of key relevance to understanding current debates in technology and in the ethics
of AI.
Questions in the philosophy of technology concerning the relationship between
technology and nature and humanity’s place and role in relation to nature are directly
relevant to key issues in AI ethics.
A range of implicit values are often attributed to technology, which will shape
responses to many ethical questions.
AI has a role in communication technologies. Communication is inherently
ethical, directly impacting the nature and quality of relationships between people
and the understanding and transmission of information.
3.8
Educator Notes
Questions in the philosophy of technology may appeal to students who have less
interest in ethics per se. It is important to encourage students throughout the course to
develop the skills and understanding to see how these questions do intimately
connect with questions in ethics.
It is possible to give students an overview of some of the most relevant questions
for ethics in AI without requiring them to read the entire chapter. Setting reading for
some subsections plus accompanying exercises will give students an opportunity to
consider the relevance of these questions for issues in AI ethics and help to prepare
them for much of the material later in the book.
Many, indeed most, of the exercises are designed so that students can attempt
them without background reading, and the process of considering their answers will
serve as a good introduction to issue we tackle later in the book, even if students do
not have time to explore this chapter in great detail: for example, Exercises 1, 2, 3, 5,
7, 8, and 10.
It would be useful for students to look at Sect. 3.5 on the implicit values of
technology, as priming students to think about these issues can help to prepare them
for considering their own attitudes, as well as how such implicit attitudes may mould
debates in AI ethics.
Debate and extended project or essay topics Many of the exercises could form
good class debate and discussion topics. Exercise 2 could be useful for detailed
discussion if students or the educator prepares some examples and could be valuable
for encouraging students to look for details of how AI is presented. Likewise, in
Exercise 7, images could be prepared in advance or found in class. Exercise 6 could
form a group project where students could compare responses and be encouraged to
think about the implications of information collection for one purpose and its
meaning in another context. Exercise 8 could form an entertaining topic that could

challenge students to try to articulate their attitudes towards AI and prepare the
ground for later ideas around boundary issues, purity and disgust.

Methods in Applied Ethics
Abstract There are signiﬁcant disagreements about the methods used in applied
ethics. This chapter reviews some central methodological questions and the under-
lying philosophical issues. A simple account of a common approach is outlined:
consider one’s initial response to a case of interest, and then apply reasoning to test
or correct one’s initial response. Issues arising from this simple model include the
status and reliability of immediate responses and the nature of any reasoning process,
including the selection and justiﬁcation of any framework of ethical values and
ethical theory used. Certain features of AI itself pose particular challenges for the
methodology in applied ethics, including ways in which developments in technology
can impact how we understand concepts. Beliefs about the nature of ethics itself will
also impact methodology, including assumptions about consistency, completeness,
and clarity in ethics, and the very purpose of morality; we look at some common
assumptions. The way in which cases are selected and described is critical, affecting
how agency and responsibility are attributed, among other questions. We examine
how narratives about AI and images of AI may inﬂuence how we approach ethical
issues and how ﬁction, including science ﬁction, may be used in addressing ethical
questions in AI.

Introduction: A Simple Account of Methods in Applied
Ethics
Summary
We introduce the need for a methodology in applied ethics by outlining a common
approach, which uses reason to interrogate intuitive responses to concrete cases. This
approach raises many vexed questions, which we go on to explore further in this
chapter.

Methods in Applied Ethics
We have discussed the wide range of the questions in AI ethics, indicated the depth
of disagreement and the complexity of the disputes, but have said little about how we
might go about ﬁrst addressing questions to our own satisfaction and second,
engaging in fruitful discussion and dialogue with others, whether we agree with
them and wish to explore the issues further, or whether we disagree. This chapter
aims to shed some light on the vexed question of methodology in applied ethics and
on particular issues about methodology that are especially salient in AI ethics.
The subdiscipline of ethics known as applied ethics or practical ethics has
developed and grown over the last several decades and is now commonly taught
both in philosophy departments and in other university departments, where speciﬁc
courses geared to ethical questions arising from certain disciplines and practices are
studied. Applied ethics also forms part of many professional development courses.
Considerable research work, including policy work, also draws upon the methods
and practices of applied ethics. There are debates within philosophy about methods
used in applied ethics and what the status of its conclusions are [1, 2]. These debates
in turn rest upon accounts of the broad nature of ethics, on which there is also a
variety of views. Nonetheless, much work in applied ethics proceeds along the basic
lines of presenting ethical issues or moral dilemmas, generating a response to these
issues, and then attempting to ﬁne-tune one’s initial response.
A simple account of methods in applied ethics To introduce these issues, let us
start with an overview of an approach commonly introduced in applied ethics texts
or in classroom teaching. There may be more complexity in practice, but it is often
explained in very simple terms of a two-stage approach.
Take a case, or series of cases, presenting ethical questions. First, consider the
case and form one’s initial judgement about the rights and wrongs of what is
involved. This initial judgement is often described as an intuition.
Second, apply reasoning to test the soundness of one’s intuition. Applied ethics is
thus presented as a way of adding consistency, judgement, and reason to spontane-
ous responses to complex ethical scenarios. A certain relationship between concrete
cases and theory is thereby assumed.
Examination will quickly reveal that while one could take this basic two-step
description of methodology and give it a go, there are several questions to ask about
how precisely to operate this method and about its soundness.
Exercise 1
On June 11, 2022, the Washington Post published an article about a Google
engineer, Blake Lemoine, who worked with LaMDA (Language Model for Dialogue
Applications), initially having signed up to test if LaMDA used discriminatory or
hate speech [3]. (Note the awareness of the need to test for such potentially
problematic language—this is a few years after the Tay Chatbot ethical ﬁasco that
we discussed in Chap. 2). The dialogue topics between the engineer and LaMDA
included the fear of death and meditation. Lemoine and a collaborator presented
evidence to Google claiming that LaMDA was sentient. These claims were
dismissed, and Lemoine was placed on paid administrative leave and then went

public with his claims. ‘Considerable interest was generated in the case’, one might
say.

Introduction: A Simple Account of Methods in Applied Ethics

1. What is your initial reaction to the ethical issues?
2. How would you go about testing and reﬁning your initial response?
3. What kinds of questions do you have about this exercise, and what difﬁculties can
you foresee with such an approach?
You may have some familiarity with this case already or may wish to do a little
research on the case, but the exercise can be done simply on the description above.
Your responses should provide an introduction to the issues we will investigate in
further detail in this chapter.
We hope to address many of your questions in this chapter and indeed later in the
book. This chapter will not be able to ‘solve’ the problem of methodology in AI
ethics, but it aims to explain some of the foundational issues upon which the question
of methodology rests and to point to some strategies and skills one can adopt to
advance the rigour and integrity of one’s approach to ethics, both for developing
one’s own views and for engaging in constructive dialogue with those with whom
one disagrees.
We will look at some ways this model can be built upon and improved, but also
how it may be questioned more fundamentally, focusing speciﬁcally on issues that
may be especially pertinent in relation to AI. This then forms another illustration of
some of the ways in which AI presents particular challenges in ethics.
A sceptical view of this approach to applied ethics is that initial, immediate
responses to ethically problematic cases represent a rough-and-ready, knee-jerk
response built of fear, self-interest, prejudice, or hope and that the ‘reasoned’
response that follows on reﬂection is merely post hoc rationalisation. It will be
hard to shake off such suspicions in all cases.
Daniel Kahneman: Thinking, Fast and Slow [4]
Of course, we can all make mistakes in reasoning. Hence, any reasoning
applied in thinking about ethics can also be subject to mistakes. Much work
in recent decades has examined some of the characteristic errors to which
human beings are prone [5]. Some of these errors occur when heuristic
devices, simple shortcuts to working out an answer, which work much of the
time, are used in ways which may deliver wrong answers. There are various
reasons why human beings tend to make such errors of reasoning. Lack of time
is one of them. We may also be subject to characteristic errors driven by
paying attention to certain factors in our environment which are especially
salient to us because of our evolutionary past. We can do much ourselves,
whether solo or with the help of others, to combat our tendency towards such
errors and to correct them when they arise. However, we are unlikely to escape
(continued)

them entirely. One of the hopes of AI may be to help us overcome and avoid
such errors. We discuss the possibility of AI as a moral assistant in Chap. 11.

Daniel Kahneman’s work on human reasoning has received much attention.
He proposes that it is helpful to think of ourselves as having two broad systems
of thinking. System 1 is fast and operates to produce automatic responses and
rapid judgements about situations. System 2 is slow and operates when we
exert mental time and effort to come to a judgement. We may think of
‘thinking’ as resembling System 2 thought and deliberation, but Kahneman’s
work suggests that much of the time we are actually just working on System
1 judgements.
One may perhaps conclude that initial responses to ethical cases are System
1 thinking, and the reasoning that is then applied may represent System
2 thinking. However, this is very possibly too simplistic, even if one accepts
Kahneman’s general approach. One’s ethical response to a situation may have
been formed by years of experience and thought, just as a highly trained
musician may instantly respond in a certain way to a piece of music. Contrari-
wise, the reasoning that is then applied which attempts to consider one’s initial
response more carefully may in fact include numerous errors and unquestioned
assumptions.
Communication is key One reason why we need to address methodology is to help
to make possible respectful and fruitful dialogue, where we understand the ground
rules of engagement are, including any disagreements about what these should
be. Examination of many disasters, including those involving technology, often
demonstrates that a key factor was failures in communication [6]. Understanding
the points of view of others can be enhanced by greater self-understanding, by clarity
of analysis, and by imagination in exploring and approaching ethical questions. Just
as one of the major questions in AI concerns the potential dehumanisation of those
human beings who are replaced or exceeded by machines in some way, the
dehumanisation of opponents and those with views in ethics that we might ﬁnd
wrong, or even repellent, rarely helps the journey to ﬁnd some kind of solution, or
liveable compromise. Communication and understanding can help, even if that
understanding is not reciprocated.
4.1.1
Problems in the Methodology
Let us consider some of the questions we need to ask about the process of critical
reasoning regarding our initial ethical responses to situations. Note ﬁrst that although
this is sometimes thought of as a two-step approach, there are more than two steps.
The ﬁrst step is the selection of a case or cases. The second step is how such cases are
described. Some of the possible questions you might have had include the following,

illustrated by features of the LaMDA case; please do add any other thoughts of your
own, as it’s impossible to cover everything.

The selection and description of cases Can these bias our ethical judgements?
Awareness of past relevant cases is likely to inﬂuence how we think of the case
under consideration. In this instance, awareness of Timnit Gebru’s ﬁring from
Google and of the Tay Chatbot may come to mind. You may also be thinking of
cases drawn from science ﬁction. You may also have knowledge of previous cases of
people being duped by language models. Should this case ever have been described
as an instance of possible machine sentience? Or is this a case about the ease with
which such false attributions are made?
The status given to one’s initial (intuitive) response Has it any standing at all?
The coverage of this case, especially including reactions on social media, was often
rather heated, with reactions ranging from amazement and fear, pity for LaMDA,
and scornful rejection of both the notion that LaMDA could possibly have any
sentience and of the views of those who dismissed this possibility. Such intuitions
may be thought to be merely emotional reactions and hence prone to manipulation
and bias. The powers of AI-driven media to persuade and to sway our emotions may
indeed be one source of concern about how readily such responses are created and
elicited in humans.
A counter to a sceptical response to intuition might be to ask whether what is
described as an ‘intuition’ is in fact one’s ‘conscience’ and hence something that
should be listened to carefully. Recall our brief discussion of the value of dignity in
Sect. 2.4.9. Should an initial response of alarm and compassion towards LaMDA be
treated seriously as a possible indicator of moral concerns that might otherwise be
overlooked? We will consider such questions further when examining moral epis-
temology in Chap. 7.
The generation of ethical questions The LaMDA case, like many others in this
complex area, gives rise to a number of different ethical questions. Some may
receive more attention than others. Some may receive no attention at all. Possible
questions here include the treatment of the engineer by Google; the general issue of
whistleblowing at such companies, and whether this might possibly count as
whistleblowing or merely as poor behaviour by an employee; the theoretical issues
of attributing sentience to a computer; the link between apparent proﬁciency at
language and the attribution of sentience; what the attribution of intelligence and
sentience says about us; whether we should be doing such research if it produces
sentience; what such large companies may be getting up to without the knowledge of
the general public; fears of unleashing a sentient intelligence on the public; and the
media coverage of the question.
Note that in many discussions of applied ethics, examples are introduced as cases
about a particular set of issues. However, this could possibly obscure other issues
that need to be exposed to fully understanding what is going on.

The

of
any
ethical
theory used How can one even reason in ethics? Is ethics not just a matter of
opinion? A case involving such complex and conﬂicting reactions as this one
perfectly illustrates this basic issue, which for many is a major stumbling block in
our capacity to come to any resolution about ethics. We will discuss this further
again in Chap. 6.
The appropriateness of any speciﬁc values selected and applied in any
given areas Do we know what the ethical values governing AI should be? Isn’t
that something we should sort out ﬁrst? Some believe that the kind of language
model involved couldn’t possibly produce sentience, and hence that concerns about
LaMDA do not have to include safeguards about what to do should it become
sentient. Animal welfare charities checking out potential owners who want to
adopt strays do not concern themselves with whether the home contains reading
material suitable for dogs and cats. Dogs and cats don’t read. Likewise, if LaMDA’s
sentience was out of the question, no provision for concern need be made.
The relative priority given to intuitive responses or theory If there is a mismatch
between your intuitions of the rightness or wrongness of a situation and your
theoretical commitments, the question then arises as to what has got to give. Similar
questions may arise when a particular case presents you with a situation where a
choice must be made between two values. Suppose, for example, that one considered
that decisions within the justice system should always be made by human beings.
However, then suppose that it transpired that in certain kinds of cases, for example,
complex cases of fraud, an algorithm produce more accurate judgements than a jury.
How would you resolve such a conﬂict? (See Sect. 2.4.3.)
4.1.2
From Theory to Practice and Back Again: Fine-Tuning
Responses in Applied Ethics
The process of eliciting initial responses to a situation and then applying reason is
not one-way. John Rawls was perhaps the single most inﬂuential political philoso-
pher of the twentieth century. In his work, A Theory of Justice, he outlines a model of
reﬂective equilibrium for reasoning about practical cases and for achieving coher-
ence in our responses to different situations [7]. Suppose we ﬁnd that our ethical
theory and general moral principles produce answers that seem wrong or perhaps on
occasion crazy. (I say this having spent years listening to philosophy undergraduates
try to work out the consequences of some of their theoretical claims in class.)
Alternatively, suppose we have a set of strongly held moral judgements, but we
cannot ﬁnd any deeper theoretical framework to ground and justify all of these
together. One can strive for reﬂective equilibrium, a state of coherence between
concrete judgements and justifying theory, by making adjustments in one’s

theoretical framework and/or in one’s concrete judgements until a state of settled
coherence, or equilibrium, is reached.
4.1
Introduction: A Simple Account of Methods in Applied Ethics
137
Predictably, philosophers have long argued about how precisely to attain such a
state of equilibrium and whether or not a state of coherence between judgements and
theory means that one has arrived at the ‘truth’ ethically. Readers will no doubt
readily be able to work out that very different conclusions could be reached,
depending upon how much one was prepared to adjust one’s theory or one’s
judgements. Moreover, it is entirely possible that the same set of judgements could
be coherently grounded with reference to somewhat different theories, although
perhaps in such a case, the possibility of further test cases to discriminate between
theoretical frameworks may always remain. There is always the distinct possibility
that the ways in which an individual, or a group, decides to resolve tensions is
motivated by self-interest, fear, or other less than admirable reasons.
There are various steps that might be taken in the application of reason to ﬁne-
tune one’s initial intuitive response. For example, details of the case may be
changed, or other cases with certain parallels and disanalogies may be presented to
test the consistency of one’s judgement. Inconsistent judgements may be used to
indicate some error and thus require one to apply reason to resolve the inconsistent
responses. However, this then produces further questions:
How consistency or inconsistency is determined, and why consistency is
required? One strategy used to test responses to particular cases is to consider
other cases that differ in certain respects and to check if one’s responses to each are
consistent. However, to determine consistency, one ﬁrst has to decide which points
of comparison are morally relevant. How do we do that? Determining moral
relevance is not straightforward, as we will see at various points in the book.
Furthermore, we can even ask why consistency is even required in ethics. This
may never have occurred to many readers as an issue. Surely consistency is essential.
But why? Consistency can even be a problem with some of our choices and
preferences. Every single time I asked my kids what kind of cake they wanted me
to make, they replied, ‘chocolate cake’. However, when I asked them, ‘Do you never
want to eat any other kind of cake?’, they would say no, having particular fondness
for lemon drizzle cake as well as for a large variety of other cakes. Consistency of
chocolate cake is a suboptimal solution. We shall consider this issue presently.
Moreover, there is a common ﬂaw in human judgement that may be especially
pertinent here. The notion of cognitive dissonance is one of the best corroborated
theories in social psychology [8]. When there is dissonance in our beliefs, or
between our beliefs and actions, this produces discomfort, which we will try to
reduce. However, we may do this in irrational ways, for example, by ignoring
evidence counter to certain beliefs. This means that great care must be taken in
any response to divergence between theory and response to cases. We may stop
looking at cases that clash with our most treasured theories or at theoretical stances
that create problems for our responses to particular issues. This is yet another reason
for open debate, listening to others, and subjecting our own views to scrutiny.

Methods in Applied Ethics
Reﬁning ethical theories by considering application to particular cases is one slice
of the bread and butter of philosophical debate. Let us try this out in an exercise. A
simple version of utilitarianism holds that we should strive to produce the maximum
amount of pleasure and the minimum amount of pain. This theory has at least some
initial plausibility, since we can readily understand why pleasure attracts us and why
pain is bad. It’s rather hard to understand how someone could deny the badness
of pain.
The ‘Experience Machine’ as a Test of Ethical Theory
A classic test case is the ‘experience machine’, ﬁrst proposed by the philoso-
pher Robert Nozick [9], but now also presented to us through variations on the
same theme found in such ﬁctional accounts as the movie The Matrix [10], and
looming closer on the horizon of possibility through technologies such as
virtual reality. Here, philosophical imaginings predating some of the real
questions that we are now facing. There are variations between different
possible iterations of the experience machine which we won’t concern our-
selves with here, but you may ﬁnd it interesting to delve into these.
In the experience machine, one could live out a life of endless pleasure, but
this would not be in the ‘real world’. The core of the philosophical issue is the
divorce of the subjective experience of pleasure, from the source of that
pleasure. Instead of feeling pleasure from, say, the accomplishment of planting
an orchard, or from sharing a meal with a friend, one simply has the subjective
feeling of having done so. Leaving aside the practical worries that the expe-
rience machine may break down, etc., would you enter it?
Most people say no, but a not insigniﬁcant minority say yes.
Exercise 2
For those who would not enter, spell out why not. How could you modify the version
of utilitarianism that holds we ought to aim for pleasure, and the absence of pain, so
that it could differentiate between life in the experience machine and life outside it?
If you would enter, explain why. How could you argue that being in the
experience machine was the best thing to do?
Hint: This is a very open-ended and rather difﬁcult question. However,
addressing it will help to illuminate many questions in AI ethics.
It is useful to realise how many of the philosophical questions that arise in AI
ethics have already been discussed by philosophers in other contexts.
Interpreting rules, concepts, and theories One way of responding to such tests of
theory is to see it as raising questions about how precisely a theory is being
interpreted. We can make assumptions about how we understand a concept or a
theory, only to have those assumptions called into question by novel situations. Any
theory needs to be interpreted before it can be applied. A rule to be followed can only
provide certainty within a system that is already completely formally speciﬁed. The

problem of interpreting rules also means that it is often less easy than it may at ﬁrst
appear to judge whether a rule or a concept has been applied or used consistently
across different cases. This keeps judges and lawyers in business. The question of
interpreting rules will be critically important in the question of whether AI can act
morally, as we shall see.
4.1
Introduction: A Simple Account of Methods in Applied Ethics
139
Use of standard ethical theories Ethical theory may be explicitly called upon as a
framework in which to reason and resolve disputes. Ethical theories may focus on
broad questions about the nature of ethics—metaethics—or may focus on substan-
tive claims about the nature of morality and about how form moral judgements,
normative ethical theories. Indeed, ‘applied ethics’ is often seen as simply the
application of normative ethical theory to concrete cases. Certain normative ethical
theories are frequently drawn on in applied ethics: consequentialist theories that
focus on ethical outcomes, deontological theories focusing on the nature of the moral
rules to be followed, and virtue ethics theories focusing on the moral character of the
agent. We look in more detail at normative ethical theories in Chap. 6, addressing the
question of their ﬁt to the particular ethical questions raised by AI.
We must take care that our approach does not assume that our theories are
complete and that we have nothing else to learn from the world. In practice, our
ethical theories evolve and develop, sometimes in response to internal inconsis-
tencies, sometimes in response to argument based on alternative theories, and
sometimes in response to cases.
4.1.3
Searching for Help: Can We Base AI Ethics on Ideas
Borrowed from Medical Ethics?
We have raised the question of how novel the issues of AI ethics are. Naturally, they
cannot be entirely new, or we would have no way of understanding them. It has often
been suggested that we can help ourselves to an ethical framework applied in another
setting and use that with any modiﬁcations that might be needed. The prime example
suggested is that of medical ethics; perhaps lessons from this area of professional
practice can be applied to AI. Medical ethics has developed into a mature discipline
over many decades, attaining considerable broad international agreement on certain
core issues, such as the importance of informed consent, with nuance and local
variation. Hence, it could be extremely useful to be able to base responses to AI
ethics on such a well-developed area. Moreover, some speciﬁc sets of values have
already been developed, which meet with considerable broad agreement while
allowing for debate and difference of opinion.
In medical ethics, and in bioethics more broadly, a commonly applied and
inﬂuential framework of values can be found in the work of Beauchamp and
Childress, who distil from medical practice, law, and ethics certain key principles
of bioethics [11]. It has been suggested that we can take the central ethical values that

have been developed in medical ethics or bioethics more broadly, of autonomy,
beneﬁcence, nonmaleﬁcence, and justice, and add to them a key issue that addresses
speciﬁc questions arising in the case of AI: explainability [12].
140

Methods in Applied Ethics
However, many questions arise, and the suggestion of basing AI ethics on
medical ethics illustrates some of the complexities of measuring theoretical issues
in ethics against concrete practical cases [13, 14]. The context of practical applica-
tion can make a profound difference. This indeed presents one of the challenges of
approaching the area of AI ethics. Indeed, it is such a broad area that there may be
difﬁculties in generalising from one set of questions in AI ethics to another.
Understanding concepts in relation to speciﬁc instances Theoretical concepts
developed within the practice of medicine have been articulated within that context
and thus will have gained a particular ﬂavour and interpretation. For instance,
autonomy will have been understood with the notion of bodily and medical auton-
omy as the primary focus. Medical autonomy generally focuses on questions of
patient choice over medical procedures and hence over the body. Complexities arise
about how precisely to understand and apply the concept of autonomy even within
medical settings. Autonomy over medical decisions is not necessarily interpreted as
implying that any body modiﬁcation whatsoever is to be respected; ‘ﬁrst do no harm’
also applies as well as notions of the patient’s best interest.
Recall the example of the Neuralink implant discussed in Chap. 3 (see Exercise
9). Should one draw a distinction between the use of such an implant for medical
reasons and for other reasons? This is partly a question of how we understand
autonomy. In the healthcare context, autonomy is not usually interpreted as permit-
ting volunteers to opt for such experimental procedures, especially not those involv-
ing the brain (although this concerns ideals of medical practice). There are numerous
examples of grotesque abuse, including, for instance, the lobotomy.
How health is understood will thus make a difference to how the concept of
autonomy is ﬂeshed out and applied within medicine. We also need to understand
the concept of health itself. This question is not as straightforward as it may at ﬁrst
appear. The precise deﬁnition of disease and illness is far from easy, nor can it be
assumed that health is simply the absence of disease or illness [15]. Health may be
thought of primarily as physical health, but the practices of psychiatry and clinical
psychology have expanded that to include mental health; noting the importance of
the social determinants of health, some deﬁnitions of health may also include
reference to the social circumstances in which a person lives [16]. This introduces
into any account of autonomy, reference not just to the individual but to social
relationships, and political questions will quickly ensue.
An inﬂuential deﬁnition of health developed by Aboriginal groups in Australia
has expanded an account of health further to include cultural and historical factors,
noting that health must be a whole-of-life concept; the notion of ‘health’ does not
even translate very well into Aboriginal languages [17]. Therefore, even within
medicine, we can see that there are major questions around how we understand
and apply notions of autonomy is vastly complex. Attempting to apply this notion to

the multitude of circumstances in which AI may be applied will be more complex
still.
4.1
Introduction: A Simple Account of Methods in Applied Ethics
141
However, there are many lessons we can nonetheless learn from medical ethics.
Ethical questions of medical autonomy have risen to the fore historically because of
power imbalances and the need to protect patients from the power of the medical
profession. There may be lessons to be learned here in AI regarding the autonomy of
individuals against the autonomy and power of those building and deploying
AI. This may be relevant to the LaMDA case, depending on what the actual facts
of the matter were, as with many other cases in AI. To value autonomy does not get
us very far; there is much detail to be ﬁlled out regarding how precisely the notion of
autonomy should be understood and how valued and how we should understand the
issue of autonomy of individuals in relation to those who develop and deploy AI and,
indeed, in relation to the autonomy of AI itself. The central question of the control of
humans by AI and the control over AI by humans requires speciﬁc thought; we
cannot simply borrow a notion of autonomy from the ﬁeld of medical ethics.
Likewise, issues of beneﬁcence and nonmaleﬁcence within medicine will have
been ﬂeshed out (pardon the pun) in relation to health and illness. Within AI, the sky
is the limit, especially if we consider some of the more futuristic scenarios. As we
shall see later in the book, especially in Chap. 11, it may even be hard to concep-
tualise what might constitute ‘beneﬁt’ when contemplating some far future
possibilities.
So, although issues such as autonomy and beneﬁcence are common to both
medical ethics and AI ethics, they may not get us as far as we wish, not simply
just in the application to practice but in terms of how precisely such concepts are
understood in different settings.
Trouble for medical ethics: genetics, genomics, and advances in science
and technology The idea of basing ethical approaches to AI on the well-developed
example of medical ethics does have certain merits. It would indeed be foolish not to
consider if lessons could be learned. However, one of the lessons that we should
learn is exactly how hard it can be to apply even relatively straightforward ethical
values in practice, especially under the pressure of changes in science and
technology.
The area of genetics and genomics presents some salutary lessons of strong
relevance for AI, since they concern personal data, advancing techniques of data
processing and analysis, and the vast increase in the generation of information this
enables. We saw in Sect. 3.3.4 how changes in medical and genetic knowledge can
impact how we construct risk. Developments in scientiﬁc understanding and tech-
nical possibility can make for unexpected practical problems in protecting key
values and for unexpected conceptual problems in how we even understand some
core issues central to ethics.
My data or yours? It has long been known that we share genes with close relatives.
For example, the Y chromosome is transmitted from father to son almost without
variation, excluding occasional mutations. Likewise, mitochondrial DNA is

transmitted down the motherline to all descendants. What has changed in recent
years is the capacity to readily obtain speciﬁc genetic information about individuals,
which also thus generates information about close relatives. There is also now
capacity to detect and analyse extremely small traces of DNA, for example, at
crime scenes. Note that changes in the ease, cost, and scale of access to information
produce these ethical problems.

Am I my brother’s keeper? A central value of medical ethics is the privacy of
one’s medical information, but is one’s genetic information simply one’s own
information, if it also has direct implications for others? Cases include instances
where criminals have been traced via DNA uploaded to ancestry sites by relatives or
where the genetic risk proﬁle of one family member is automatically revealed by the
genetic testing of another. The ease of acquiring such knowledge facilitated by
technology, the social and cultural forces shaping the impetus to generate such
knowledge, together with the scientiﬁc knowledge, produces complex situations
that shape changing attitudes towards privacy [18]. The very notion that one’s
medical information is one’s own is challenged by genetic information; our origins
as biological beings and our essential relatedness to others present a tangible
challenge to the atomistic, isolated individual which sits at the centre of many
common explications of ethics, at least in the West since the Enlightenment.
Hacking privacy The privacy of medical and genetic information is protected by
ethics, by law, and by consent agreements obtained in the practice of medicine and in
medical research. However, assurances of privacy have been made extremely difﬁ-
cult as a result of increasing powers of data analysis. A common practice of assuring
privacy for those giving their genetic information to research projects was to present
aggregated results only so that speciﬁc individuals could not be identiﬁed. However,
in 2009, Homer et al. demonstrated that it was possible to infer the presence of an
individual within DNA data aggregated from 1000 individuals [19]. Jane Gitschier
demonstrated, also in 2009, the theoretical possibility that combining data sets
would enable the prediction of surnames of individual members of anonymised
DNA
data
banks,
given
that
surnames
track
the
inheritance
of
the
Y
chromosome [20].
The production of genomic information overlaps with the technologies of AI,
which are our present concern. The changing attitudes towards ethical and legal
challenges of privacy that we face in regard to AI have precursors within genetics
and genomics, which form an essential backdrop to how we understand issues within
AI ethics.
These cases create difﬁculties in accounts of ethics that centre the individual, as
medical ethics traditionally has. At this point, consider the emphasis on relationships
and community stressed in the Indigenous Protocols we looked at in Sect. 2.9.
Exercise 3
Consider the data about you that can be made easily available by technology.
Consider what data are available freely to anyone and what is available to particular
individuals, organisations, or government departments. Is any of the data that you

regard as data ‘about you’, also data which is about someone else as well? How
much could your privacy be impacted, by data that someone else might consider to
be theirs to control?

Ethics
Summary
We consider some of the major difﬁculties and controversies concerning how to
make progress in applied ethics, focusing particularly on issues of most signiﬁcance
to AI ethics. Developments in science and technology can raise both practical and
conceptual difﬁculties. We note the centrality for AI of questions regarding agency
and of boundaries. The way in which we describe the world is of vital importance,
but the very technologies we are addressing themselves impact how we see the
world.
We have introduced the difﬁculties of methodology in applied ethics in general,
illustrated with the example of LaMDA, and considered the extent to which the
model of medical ethics can assist with work in AI ethics. This section summarises
speciﬁc reasons for difﬁculty in methodology in AI ethics and some central issues
prominent in AI ethics that will be particularly challenging given these methodo-
logical issues. Some of this refers again to some of the features of AI ethics we have
emphasised in earlier chapters.
Time frames This issue has also been referred to earlier (see Sect. 1.3). We are
designing the future now. The speed of change of technologies means that the world
from which we derive our values is changing even as we seek to assess these
changes. The speed of change in communication technologies and their adoption
is especially pertinent, for this is modifying the ways in which we apprehend the
world and hence how we view the ethical issues that arise from these novel
technologies. This gives us good reason for caution. On the other hand, this is not
a counsel of despair. The past can contain guides for the future in ways that may turn
out to be surprising. Many well-worn philosophical debates in ethics turn out to have
considerable relevance for modern technology.
Speed, change, and hype Consider the apparent simplicity of the ‘intuition plus
reasoning’ model of applied ethics. A great deal hangs on how we respond to the
cases under consideration. Hype is an ever-present issue. Any perusal of responses to
the LaMDA case will demonstrate that fear may ensue; the hype surrounding such
cases may produce a wide variety of reactions, some of which may be based on
misinformation or sheer panic. This will impact both how we describe cases and
which cases and issues receive attention. When news broke of the claims that
LaMDA was sentient, computer experts were kept busy all day answering often
ridiculous questions about it. My electrician even emailed me in a panic at 6.15 in the

morning asking for my opinion, worrying that LaMDA was truly sentient and that
Google was covering it up.
144

Methods in Applied Ethics
Conversely, we may become accustomed to technologies and adjust our views of
them, individually and collectively, with considerable rapidity. We may forget and
overlook certain aspects of them. Initial reactions may come to appear comical. On
the other hand, other concerns with hindsight may appear as prescient warnings that
are too casually dismissed. Who knows the difference?
Developments in science and in technology impact ethics Not only can develop-
ments produce new ethical dilemmas, but they can also produce shifts in our
concepts and values. Work in the philosophy of technology discussed in Chap. 3
demonstrates this possibility (especially Sect. 3.5), and this point is also illustrated
by the examples above from genomics.
As we have seen, our use of technology, together with our attitudes towards it,
can shape how we respond to ethical issues. We saw in Chap. 3 warnings that
thinking of the world through particular ways of imagining and understanding AI
may also colour our picture of ourselves. We also saw the need to understand that AI
may be seen not simply as a set of engineering capabilities, not only as a science, but
also as an ideology. Blake Lemoine tweeted that there was no scientiﬁc framework
to resolve the question of whether LaMDA was sentient but that his opinions were
based upon religious beliefs [21]. Could it be that the very aspirations to reproduce
or even improve on human intelligence through AI might inﬂuence any initial
responses to ethical issues, our faith in our own intuitions, and the nature and role
of ‘reason’? Could such a hope in the future transformative power of AI, or a view of
humans as in need of improvement in some speciﬁc ways, feed into the depth of
division of viewpoints in this arena, as those with cautions and naysayers are
dismissed as dinosaurs or Luddites?
Exercise 4
Are a person’s religious beliefs relevant to how we assess their claim that AI is, or
might be, sentient? If so, how? Consider arguments for and against this. Consider
different forms of religious belief.
The global and the local This technology has global reach in many instances,
although not all. One way forward for AI ethics is simply blatantly to impose a
particular dominant morality upon others. This has indeed often happened and still
happens, but there is growing awareness that at the very least, one must be seen to be
attempting not to do this. This again raises questions about methodologies. The
strategy of eliciting an initial response to an ethical issue and then applying reason
may work for me and for my group, but why should my answer apply to
anybody else? This is the major reason why I emphasise the need to ﬁnd strategies
for thinking about ethics that might facilitate dialogue and mutual understanding.
As many have warned, one of the chief hazards of AI is its potential for control
over behaviour and over information, its way of approaching understanding of the
world and its problems, and the potential for global reach, which brings with it

serious perils of a dangerous totalising ethic [22]. One might not mind one’s own
ethic being applied globally, but if it is someone else’s, the idea palls somewhat. This
risk is linked to a general danger of the unwarranted imposition of uniformity of
standards.
4.2
The Challenges from AI for Methodology in Applied Ethics
145
Crowdsourcing ethics as a solution Some current work to embed ethical values
into technologies illustrates one approach of trying to ﬁnd a shared solution, for
example, the MIT Moral Machines experiment (https://www.moralmachine.net)
[23]. This is an inventive way of addressing such issues, which itself makes use of
computing technology. It concerns how to ﬁnd answers to the question of the
programming of autonomous vehicles in response to a potential collision. The
Moral Machines experiment presents a series of online scenarios where participants
have to choose between two possibilities for crashing a car into pedestrians. Many
thousands worldwide have completed these tests. Such a way of ‘crowdsourcing’
ethics could be a means of deciding how to programme a vehicle, perhaps with
sensitivity to different cultural contexts, given that it would be possible to
programme autonomous vehicles differently in different geographical areas, but
there are numerous methodological questions raised, including the question of
whether taking the average judgement of ‘the crowd’ is a good way of reaching
moral answers. We will look at certain aspects of the Moral Machines experiment in
Chap. 7.
Outsourcing our ethics The MIT Moral Machines experiment also exempliﬁes
another kind of question that occurs in AI ethics only—the very idea of somehow
programming ethics into a machine. If we need to consider how we as humans come
to conclusions in ethics and ﬁnd an answer challenging, we also need to consider
how we could expect a machine to do this. Many do not consider this to be a sensible
or even possible thing to do. The whole question of enabling and allowing AI to
make ethical judgements raises methodological questions requiring an examination
of ethical theory because on only some accounts of the nature of ethics and ethical
judgements is this truly possible. Recall the discussion of Kant’s view of moral
motivation in Chap. 1. On this approach, if we allow a machine to make a moral
judgement for us, our actions have no intrinsic moral worth, even if a good result
occurs.
It is useful to mention two other issues that are central to AI ethics and that will be
especially affected by how cases are described, how theory is applied, and how
concepts are understood, as well as which ethical theories are seen to be relevant.
First, a critical question in AI ethics is agency: The focus on human agency and
decision-making is critical in AI ethics and hence presents us with questions
concerning some of the most basic assumptions about ethics. This includes
questions about the concentration of much power in the hands of a few individ-
uals and corporations, and the distribution of agency and responsibility between
humans and AI, as well as many other issues, raising a plethora of problems such
as how we should even think about responsibility. As we shall see in Sect. 4.2.1,

146

Methods in Applied Ethics
how cases are described and interpreted can greatly affect how agency is revealed
or concealed.
Second, questions of boundaries abound in AI and often in ways that test the
conceptual limits of our value system. The boundaries between human and
machine may be at issue. This often means that we need to rethink concepts
and deﬁnitions. As we also saw with the genomics examples, the very advances in
technology we are considering may mean that past assumptions about how our
concepts may be applied are adjusted or overturned. Questions about the bound-
aries between self and other which have been theoretical only can become
pressing issues when technology changes what is readily possible. Questions
can take on an urgency and raise new issues when they are seen on a different
scale, as may occur with the speed and scale of information processing and the
other tasks that AI can perform. These can all produce conceptual difﬁculties in
the application of theory. One’s theoretical commitments and assumptions can
shape how situations are described, as we shall see again below.
4.2.1
Describing and Identifying Ethical Issues
The question of how ethical issues are described and identiﬁed is such a key issue for
us that it is worth labouring the point. The LaMDA example, as do many others,
serves as a good illustration of how the different ways in which AI is understood—as
a discrete set of engineering challenges, or more ambitiously—will impact not just
how AI is described and seen but also how we identify and describe the ethical
issues. Many commenting about the cases have lamented that it has distracted from
the real problems of AI, diverting us from seeing AI as a useful tool and ensuring
that, as a tool, it is used beneﬁcially [24, 25]. Others, in contrast, have argued that
designers ought to have foreseen the inevitability that every so often questions of the
sentience and intelligence of AI will arise and taken steps in advance to address and
debunk such concerns [26].
Complex interactions The mix of hype plus media pressures is unlikely to help
clear thinking. The inﬂuence of the media, of lobby groups, and of those with the
most power to speak in society will be relevant to determining how ethical debate
proceeds because this will inﬂuence which issues receive the most attention and how
issues are described. This highlights the importance of whose voices are heard in
addressing questions in AI ethics. Again, there is an interplay between current
technologies and how we identify ethical questions, because of ways in which
media can drive attention, an issue with any media, especially with online media.
Language is critical to how ethical issues are determined and can help to bring the
less visible into view, or to obscure issues. A much-cited example is of bringing
certain behaviour into wider awareness with the term ‘sexual harassment’ to identify
ways in which people, initially focusing on women, are sometimes treated in the
workplace and elsewhere [27]. Behaviour which might have been seen to be part of

life, a bit of a lark, ofﬁce banter, came to be labelled with a term which, together with
a growing body of theory, literature, and activism from feminists, has led to a widely
accepted change of opinion about acceptable behaviour. Naturally, there will be
disputes about whether such new terms are being appropriately or excessively
applied. The words we use to describe a situation may steer us in particular ways
in portraying what is in front of our eyes. However, it is likely that it is not simply
language alone that does this. Critical factors were other social changes, such as the
introduction of laws against sex discrimination.
4.2
The Challenges from AI for Methodology in Applied Ethics
147
One of the major questions to grapple with is seeing that a problem exists. Again,
the history of the women’s movement can provide an illustration, although there are
many other possible examples. Writing in 1869, John Stuart Mill addressed those
who suggested that there is no problem with the role and status of women in society
by claiming that women are not complaining. He pointed out that they do indeed
complain: ‘But though women do not complain of the power of husbands, each
complains of her own husband, or of the husbands of her friends’ [28].
Moreover, the particular events that draw the most attention often have a key
inﬂuence on how subsequent policy and debate develop. Policy and regulations may
develop in response to key cases, which will sometimes be described as ‘scandals’.
Some of these, with time, may be understood to be genuinely problematic, some may
be seen to be less so, perhaps even come to be characterised as a ‘moral panic’
[29]. The speciﬁc features of prominent cases that attract most attention may have a
lasting inﬂuence but may be distorted in various ways.
Exercise 5
From memory, jot down the cases in AI ethics which ﬁrst come to mind. Then do a
search online, or ask others for their opinion on what the most important cases and
issues in AI ethics are. This is only a very approximate way of determining the level
of attention that issues are getting, but it may be worth bearing in mind that there
could be genuinely important issues that are getting much less attention. (Finding
what these might be and addressing them would be very useful!)
Bias in bias in algorithms? For example, readers will probably be aware that there
has been considerable attention to the issue of bias in algorithms in recent years. This
is indeed an important question, one deservedly getting attention, and we will look at
it in more detail later. However, there are possibly biases included in how the issue of
bias is being addressed. (This is not meant as a ‘gotcha’ moment: bias in something
that all of us humans have perpetually to struggle against, since any one of us can
only ever have a limited view of the world.) The question of bias has arisen, and is
being most prominently addressed, in particular parts of the world at a particular
time. What kinds of biases are most prominent in the debate is thus likely to be
shaped by contemporary concerns, as well as by contemporary ways of recording
and describing the world.
Ethical questions of bias are strongly impacted by the law: the law in many
countries now notes certain protected categories describing groups identiﬁed as in
particular danger of discrimination and with particular protection under the law, but

note that many of these protected categories have been introduced into law only
fairly recently—are we to assume that this may not develop further? Issues of racial
or ethnic bias, as well as bias of sex or gender, are most visible in ethical discussion
[30, 31]. Bias can only be discovered in categories that are recorded, and the manner
in which these are recorded will also shape what is found. In different parts of the
world and at different times, race and/or ethnicity is divided into different categories.
Much of the work to date refers to cases of bias in countries such as the USA, and
this in itself reﬂects a certain bias towards discovering and addressing bias within
certain geographical areas.
148
4
Methods in Applied Ethics
Moreover, what are other categories of potential bias? Some work indicates that
unless a category is explicitly included in algorithms, it may be impossible to ensure
that bias against members of that category does not occur [32]. Aristotle noted how
good-looking a person is impacts how well his or her life goes, along with other
external goods [33]. He himself was said to be rather ugly. Suppose we examined
algorithms to see if they were biased against the ugly, using some kind of beauty
score, or a height score, given that research also ﬁnds that shorter people tend to have
fewer of the good things in life? As things are, it’s entirely possible that such hidden
factors impact upon lives to a signiﬁcant degree, and it may be that algorithms are
tacitly building in bias in favour of tall, beautiful people by failing to check for this.
A key issue at the root of this is moral relevance (as well as with what data could
and should be recorded). What features of the world do we need to take into account
in judging a situation? Bias in favour of, or against, those possessing certain
characteristics is held to be immoral, since it discriminates on the basis of features
considered morally irrelevant, but what features are of moral signiﬁcance? The
history of feminism again can be used in illustration. There are still debates about
the circumstances in which a person’s sex is or is not relevant, and how precisely it is
relevant, debates that have only become more complex as questions are raised about
whether the signiﬁcant issue is sex or is gender, and how both these concepts should
be understood. Some concrete issues in AI ethics illustrate these issues, as we shall
see below (Sect. 4.4.4).
4.3
Common Assumptions About the Nature of Ethics,
and Their Inﬂuence on Methodology in Applied Ethics
Summary
Claims concerning the nature of ethics, whether explicit or assumed, will shape how
moral problems are understood and how cases are seen. These include the assump-
tion that ethics is universal in some sense, and assumptions about who counts
morally; what constitutes moral progress; the place of empirical reasoning in ethics;
the existence or otherwise of moral dilemmas; and the possibility of formalising
ethical judgements and values in language. There are also assumptions about the
object or purpose of morality, a question which should receive our attention, since

the development of technologies including AI may change some of the conditions
that lie behind assumptions about the object of morality.
4.3
Common Assumptions About the Nature of Ethics, and Their Inﬂuence on. . .
149
Certain key assumptions and disputes concerning the nature of ethics are relevant to
questions of methodology in applied ethics. These shape how we should make
ethical judgements, how we argue in ethics, and how we attempt to resolve disputes.
These issues often help to explain the existence of disagreements in AI ethics yet
may receive less attention in discussion and analysis. Many of these issues will be
examined in greater depth in subsequent chapters, when we examine normative
ethical theories in Chap. 6 and metaethics in Chap. 7.
Universalism in ethics This can be understood in different ways and has more than
one aspect. Consider an example of universalism in ethics, acceptance of universal
human rights. This can be seen as encompassing two separate elements of
universalism.
Ethics as ‘universal in scope’ It is often assumed, sometimes explicitly but often
tacitly, that ethics must be universal in scope. This may be thought of as an indicator
that the values in question are indeed ethical values, in contrast to local customs or
norms of social etiquette. It may be expressed, for example, in the thought that it is
inconsistent to think that the hunger of a child in one’s own country matters more
than the hunger of a child far away.
What exactly this claim amounts to can be somewhat complex but often is
articulated in the assumption that the same moral values should be applied every-
where: morality has no borders. This may be an implicit assumption of some (but not
all) projects aiming to implement ethics into AI itself.
It’s an assumption that may go hand in hand with assumptions that ethics is
concerned with reason (since reason is likewise generally considered universal), and
sometimes with the assumption that AI may improve upon human ethical judgement
in removing emotional bias and other alleged irrationalities.
However, the claim that ethics itself must be universal is not in fact universally
held. It may be considered that some ethical values are indeed universal in scope but
that others are more local and speciﬁc to particular communities. It may also be held
that some moral rules and duties apply to some groups and not to others.
This claim of universality is critical to the application of standards of consistency
across different cases. The claim that we must be consistent appears to require some
notion of universality of application.
Oddly, as keen attention to arguments on social media or down the pub will
reveal, adherents of this claim also often strongly defend relativism, as the view that
other cultures have their own moral values, together with the moral necessity of
respecting the values of other cultures without interference. We discuss relativism
further in Chap. 7.
Universalism in ethics as ‘equal moral value’ Universalism in ethics also takes
the form of the claim that all human beings are of equal moral value. Again, how
precisely this view is ﬁlled out may vary. In addition, again, it may be taken by some

as a sine qua non for any claim of ethics: for how could any system be recognised as
moral if it valued some humans less than others? The implications for methodology
in applied ethics are obvious. There may be a need to adjust some parts of one’s
moral theories in response to hard cases, but this central plank of ethics would
remain.
150
4
Methods in Applied Ethics
However, again, this view is not universally accepted within moral systems.
Indeed, it has been common for centuries and is still common in some parts of the
world to consider women to have fewer legal rights and a lower moral status than
men. It has been commonly held that those from outside one’s own immediate
kinship group are of lesser status.
Moreover, it is in fact readily observable that applying this ‘central plank of
ethics’ is far from straightforward. What is counted treating someone as of equal
moral value may not mean treating them the same (indeed, it should not, as we have
different needs). Under this radar, quite unequal treatment may slip in. It may be a
rhetorical move with little impact in practice. Some human beings are readily
dehumanised.
Bear this in mind in considering issues in AI ethics. It is going to be relevant in
considering the future: on its own, the ideal of equal moral treatment says nothing
about time frames. How do we, and how should we, value those humans who will
exist in the future relative to the claims of those who are alive now? If we are able to
enhance human beings with AI, what does that say about the value of those who
remain ‘au naturel’, original unmodiﬁed biohumans? We consider these questions
again in Chap. 11.
Exercise 6
Should the human race survive for a few decades more, there will be more future
human beings than currently exist. Should the human race survive for millennia,
there could be immensely more human beings alive in the future. How, if at all,
should this impact how we make decisions regarding the future of the human race?
What do you have to consider to address this question? (We will revisit questions on
this topic in Chap. 10.)
Let us go into a little more detail on this essential point.
Who counts morally? One of the central differences between approaches to ethics
hinges on the question of who (or what) counts morally, as well as the question of
how they count, and whether all count to the same degree. A useful distinction is that
between a moral agent, a being capable of thinking and acting morally, and a moral
patient, a being worthy of moral status and the consideration of moral agents. For
example, most would agree that a human baby is a moral patient but (not yet) a moral
agent.
This question is relevant to methodology in ethics in various ways. One might
start off from an assumption that what ethics is basically about is the welfare of
human beings. The questions one addresses and the issues one examines will be
based upon this assumption about how the boundaries of the ethical are to be drawn.

However, it is an assumption that can and has been questioned and one that speaks to
some of the most heated and central questions in AI.
4.3
Common Assumptions About the Nature of Ethics, and Their Inﬂuence on. . .
151
It is salutary to realise that, despite the many ways in which modern Western
philosophy looks back to the ancient Greeks, and despite the inﬂuence of Aristotle in
particular in much contemporary work on ethics, the ancient Greeks had very
different ideas about who counted morally. In fact, not only did Aristotle consider
that women were lesser beings than men, being reduced in rationality and closer to
the animals, not only did he believe that some humans were by nature slaves; in his
work on ethics and on how to live the good life, he was concerned ﬁrst and foremost
with those men who were the citizens of Athens [33]. Those outside the city were
barbarians.
However, today, we may more commonly consider that ‘everybody’ should count
morally and that each is of equal importance. John Stuart Mill attributed to Jeremy
Bentham the principle of equality that ‘everybody to count for one, and none for
more than one’ [34]. Today, many even think that it was a sine qua non of any value
system claiming to be one of ethics.
If all humans count, do only humans count? This is a critical question for
us. Bentham’s utilitarianism itself strongly suggests otherwise, for if what matters
is pleasure and the avoidance of pain, it is manifest that animals should also be
included. Being a member of the species Homo sapiens does not seem to mark out
anything of special moral relevance. The potential attribution of moral values to AI,
to intelligent or even sentient machines, means that even putting the complexities of
the claim that ‘all’ are of equal value to one side, we have to rethink these issues. To
assume an answer is to beg the question, a question of particular salience in relation
to AI.
Likewise, there are many who question whether all humans count morally. Some
have argued that what determines whether or not one possesses certain rights, such
as the right to life, is whether or not one is a person. There are various ways of
characterising a person: an agent with wants, preferences, and desires for the future,
who is aware of themselves as an individual, and who is capable of acting and
judging. On such a view, one might then consider that babies are not persons but that
some of the great apes are, and perhaps in the future, some AI might be. We will
discuss persons in greater detail in Chap. 8.
Exercise 7
Valuing persons equally. Consider the case described in Sect. 2.4.9. This involved
the use of an app to provide remote monitoring and a certain level of companionship
and stimulation for elderly people, including people living with dementia. Consider
also the use of surveillance for people living with dementia and different ways in
which this might be accomplished, discussed in Sect. 2.4.6. Consider arguments for
and against the proposition that such technology demonstrates that people living
with dementia are valued equally with any other person.
Moral progress and the ‘expanding circle’ of moral concerns [35] This is
commonly seen in growing concerns for those humans, both individuals and cultural
groups, whom we may less readily see and interact with, but historically in more

recent years has included concern for animals and for the environment more
generally. In AI, it poses questions regarding the status of advanced machines and
computers. A critical question will be the basis for any such expansion and the
precise status any such expansion may give. To give one example, farm animals may
have the right not to be treated with cruelty, but do they have the right to life, as
humans do?
152
4
Methods in Applied Ethics
Note that the common assumption that we are making moral progress, which
many see as evidenced by the ‘expanding circle’, may also drive assumptions about
the necessity of being on the alert to spot signs of moral status, as indicated by
intelligence, autonomy, or apparent sentience, in machines. The fears that were
evoked by LaMDA were perhaps as much about the possibilities of an awakening
sentience trapped in a chatbot and about the possibility that we might therefore be
abusing and exploiting some other being as about fears for ourselves. Hence, it can
be useful to articulate the notion of an expanding circle of moral concern as an
assumption and to think about its implications about how we extrapolate current
moral theory and values to novel cases involving AI.
To inﬁnity and beyond More is better. This assumption may seem obvious where
ethics is concerned—of course we want to make things as good as possible!
Maximising welfare, removing all sources of pain, and using technology to remove
every last glitch in life can all seem goals we can readily embrace and are goals that
technology may readily seem to lead us towards. Likewise for the assumption that
drives much of AI, that because knowledge is good, more knowledge is always
better.
We need to be aware that the ‘more is better’ assumption can be a trap and yet a
trap that can drive reasoning in AI ethics. It may seem that failure to strive for
constant improvement, that settling for less than the best, could not be a moral
approach. However, this view rests upon assumptions about our role, both individ-
ually and collectively, in changing the world for the better, and on assumptions about
the possibilities of such change, and the scope and limits both of our powers and of
the perfectibility of the world. We will return to the idea of perfection later in this
section and again in Chap. 5 when discussing human nature.
Empiricism and superstition There is a common notion that the removal of
‘superstition’, of spurious or unjustiﬁed metaphysical foundations, or of religious
concerns constitutes progress in ethical reasoning. This may be assumed rather than
spelled out. Look out for it in discussions of AI ethics—it can underpin some
assumptions governing aspirations for AI as providing a superior replacement to
the unreliable and easily duped human race. A picture of humans as simple-minded
fools in relation to technology may be common. Again, everything hangs on the
details of these arguments and on the moral theories underlying them. I noted above
that Blake Lemoine attributed his views on the sentience of LaMDA to a religious
stance, but it would be a mistake to consider that a religious viewpoint ipso facto
meant a ‘tainting’ of one’s moral position. Indeed, those who embrace a scientiﬁcally
based worldview may hold many of their assumptions with as much ideological

fervour as any religious person or as any political activist. This stance may also tend
to go hand in hand with rejections of moral values such as purity and dignity (see
Sects. 2.4.9 and 3.3.5) if these are made on the grounds that these concepts lack
empirical and rational rigour. Whatever view one takes of this matter, it is vital to
understand the viewpoint of others.
4.3
Common Assumptions About the Nature of Ethics, and Their Inﬂuence on. . .
153
The stance and place from which we make a judgement A basic question in
ethics concerns the attitude needed to form the best moral judgement of a situation,
one of an involved, perhaps emotional, stance, or a distanced, perhaps ‘rational’,
approach. This can also be expressed in terms of the ‘point of view’ from which one
approaches a question. Should we try to address ethical questions sub specie
aeternitatis—from the point of view of the universe? It is common to assume that
this must be so. An opposing view claims that an involved stance, a stance of
relationship and close attention, is necessary to appreciate a situation and form a
judgement. Again, assumptions about the place of reason in ethics, the powers of
cognition, and our capacity to reach the right conclusion in ethics all have a role to
play in this assumption. This view of the ‘rational’ approach to ethics can also then
feed into the assumption that it is at least to some extent possible to programme
ethics into AI. We shall look in some more detail at this question in Chaps. 6 and 7.
Consistency and completeness in ethics As we have seen in previous discussions,
it is often assumed that all moral questions have an answer, if only we could manage
to determine what it is. There are no genuinely undecidable cases (moral dilemmas).
The methodology employed may assume this, whether explicitly or not. Hence, if
there are no genuine moral dilemmas, then it should always be possible to produce
answers to different cases that together form a consistent, coherent view: because
any sign of inconsistency between a person’s moral judgements is taken to indicate
that something is wrong with one or more of the judgements, not that we are faced
with insurmountable moral questions or with moral paradox.
In my experience, few even notice that this is an assumption, suggesting that it
may be one of the driving expectations of the age. It may go hand in hand with the
common presumption that we can understand the physical world around us; the
corollary of this is that we can also understand and resolve any issues in the moral
world. This view may even be held as some kind of parallel version of the techno-
logical ﬁx—that with sustained effort, we can make a morally translucent picture of
the world.
If you think about this, it’s quite an assumption. We do not consider that we can
fully describe the awe and beauty of great works of art in this way or even scenes of
nature of outstanding natural beauty. The category of the sublime exists to capture
this; many accounts of religion speak of experiences that go beyond words; in some
religious traditions, it is forbidden even to speak the name of God. One view is that
the nature of God can only be expressed in terms of what God is not—the Via
Negativa. An everyday experience of this difﬁculty in capturing experience in words
is ﬁnding words to express how we feel about those we love. Often, comparative
means are used, gesturing at how something is to some vast degree better than

something else. Every year on Mother’s Day, millions of children write roughly the
same thing in a card, ‘to the best Mum in the world’, knowing their classmates are
doing the same and knowing at the back of their minds that not all can be correct, as
if this prosaic platitude could truly capture their feelings for their mother. A
computer programme that tried to run on the information that a billion mothers or
more were each the ‘best in the world’ would have difﬁculties. Many a lover has
struggled to express their feelings in poetry—and in poetry rather than prose
precisely because of the difﬁculty of doing so—only to fail miserably and produce
merely doggerel. In fact, some of the best love poetry precisely articulates the very
difﬁculty of expressing love in words and by grasping at comparisons. Shakespeare’s
famous 18th Sonnet reads:
154
4
Methods in Applied Ethics
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
If Shakespeare can’t quite capture his feelings for his beloved, what hope the rest
of us? Could the same be true of ethics, of our moral judgements, that these cannot
precisely be captured in words, or in mathematical formulae?
On the other hand, especially given the need to justify, explain, and communicate
ethical judgements and actions, and the desirability of developing awareness and
self-critique, perhaps this is best thought of as a difﬁculty that we should strive to
address.
The value of disagreement Note one implication for how we proceed in AI ethics,
or indeed, in any area. Especially given the uncertainties we face in how to proceed,
it may be a better tactic positively to encourage a variety of different ethical
responses (within a certain limit of acceptability, however that is described) rather
than foreclosing prematurely upon ‘the’ correct decision, or worrying unduly about
agreement per se. Allowing such diversity can be a more effective strategy for
advancing debates [36]. The value of diversity of opinion may be especially impor-
tant to remember, given the capacity of AI to permit, and to tend towards, uniform or
totalising solutions.
Different kinds of moral dilemmas There can be dilemmas with moral dimensions
where we do not know what the best course of action would be, perhaps because we
are missing some information. For example, in attempting to develop machine
learning to assist with image interpretation with medical diagnostics, it will be
necessary to test models and compare results, and in doing so, one course of action
may turn out to mean worse results for some patients, possibly resulting in illness or
death. This is unfortunate but is a dilemma because of limits to our epistemology.
It can be hard to specify precisely what a moral dilemma is because different
theories have different ways of characterising the goals of morality. However, we
can think of a genuine moral dilemma as a situation where there is no resolution

possible: whatever one does, one does something wrong; whatever one does, one has
some moral responsibility and culpability; whatever one does, something bad
happens. In other words, the world is such that there may be irresolvable moral loss.
4.3
Common Assumptions About the Nature of Ethics, and Their Inﬂuence on. . .
155
An alternative view is that the world can somehow be perfected or that a relative
moral gain is all that is needed: one simply has to choose the least worst option, and
there is no dilemma in that. Other accounts see ethics as the attempt to get as close as
possible to perfection, to hit the mark, where perfection is possible in theory but
rarely attained in practice.
Moral luck The situation where no matter what we do, we will do something wrong
has been characterised by philosophers as the question of ‘moral luck’ [37, 38]. Is
our moral world such that we can sometimes not avoid some manner of moral
blame?
Computer programmers and logicians will fully understand the need for consis-
tency. Without it, a system breaks down. In logic, it is possible to derive any
conclusion from a set of premises that contains a contradiction. We have also seen
how striving for consistency between theory and judgement in cases and striving to
have consistent reactions between different cases is a key strategy in ethical reason-
ing and a goal of ethics. The question is whether this has the status of a pragmatic
modus operandi, a heuristic device, or if it is held that the world is such that a
consistent answer, a resolution to dilemmas, can always be found.
Clarity in ethics The demand for consistency and completeness in formal systems
is possible precisely because they are formal. Elements within them can be
completely characterised, but can we guarantee that we can completely characterise
our values? Possibly not. If we can’t, this may mean that we are throwing the baby
out with the bathwater (perhaps literally, if our moral theory is based upon person-
hood, and we come to the conclusion that small babies do not yet have the full
criteria of personhood). Sometimes it is our most foundational values that resist
articulation, and all accounts have to have some ground point. Can we articulate why
it is that we think that causing another being gratuitous pain is wrong? Although
demanding consistency in moral views is a good general strategy, it is useful to
remember that it rests upon the unproven assumption that we have fully articulated,
grasped, and formalised everything of moral importance. Perhaps it is some of our
deepest values that are the hardest to fully explain. Perhaps it is an error to assume
that our values can be fully expressed in language.
There are many practical implications arising from this, including the assumption
that an opponent who has not adequately conveyed their moral position can be
dismissed. The motivation to produce an account of ethics that leaves no room for
moral dilemmas is understandable, but it can also be a force tending towards those
ethical theories that permit precise ranking of potential moral choices.
Note that our ability to formalise and precisely specify our ethical values is one of
the major issues we are faced with in addressing questions such as ‘can we
programme ethics into AI?’ Hence, this is one more issue in concerning the methods
and foundations of ethics which is brought to the fore by those questions in AI ethics

that force us to examine hard issues, such as boundary questions, and the novel
situations we are presented with pursuant on developments in technology. It is also a
question that may be illuminated by examining some of the very questions that work
in AI also addresses, the formalisation of tasks and goals.

Sophia the Robot, Citizen of Saudi Arabia
The social robot Sophia was granted citizenship of Saudi Arabia in 2017. This
gave Sophia legal personhood, the ﬁrst robot in the world to have received this.
Her creator, David Hanson, argued that Sophia could speak out for women’s
rights [39].
Commentators pointed out that in Saudi Arabia, male guardianship still
exists, which means that women have considerably fewer rights and freedoms
than men.
Sophia, however, also has no autonomy, given the limited nature of the
technology behind the robot. Many have argued against the idea of giving
robots legal personhood [40]. One could perhaps argue that the announcement
of Sophia’s citizenship did more to highlight the lack of rights of women in
Saudi Arabia than it did to further the rights of robots and was more concerned
with politics and marketing than with the actual moral status of Sophia [41].
4.3.1
The Object of Morality
In addressing the difﬁcult questions of moral methodology, it is useful to consider
what morality is for [42]. Why do we have any system of ethics at all? What is it
aiming to achieve? Why do ethical questions concern us so, and what are they really
about? An answer to these questions can help to discriminate between better and
worse approaches to methodology in applied ethics. Unfortunately, for those who
yearn for an easy answer, yet again there is a plethora of possible views. Answers to
this question will help to shape how arguments progress and how positions are
supported, what is being aimed at, and why some system of morality is needed to get
there, and will shape what we see as acceptable or realistic answers.
Answers to the question of the object of morality will include cynical or
debunking positions, such as various claims that the object of morality is to produce
a way of controlling the population to mask the interests of the powerful, whether
these be the most economically, politically, or religiously powerful in society, or to
salve our fears that life is ultimately meaningless. While we do not explore such
positions in any depth here, nonetheless, given the power of various bodies involved
in developing and using AI, and given the potential of modern media to shape views
and inﬂuence behaviour, it is a good idea not to forget such a claim entirely. It would
well be that some of what passes for ‘ethics’ is actually serving some such purpose
(see Sect. 1.9) [43, 44].

4.3
Common Assumptions About the Nature of Ethics, and Their Inﬂuence on. . .
157
The object of morality and human failings All accounts, or at least, all that I can
think of, grapple with a hallmark of morality, that it concerns how things ought to be
and/or how humans ought to behave, given that things are not always as they should
be and that we don’t always act as we should. Hence, positions may assume or state a
view of the particular weaknesses or limitations that humans possess that make
morality necessary. We will look at these questions later when discussing human
nature in more detail. Note that any position taken on human shortcomings will have
implications for what potential, if any, AI is thought to have. We discuss human
moral shortcomings in relation to the possibilities of AI in more detail in Chap. 11.
Morality is ‘a device for countering limited sympathies’ in the view of the
philosopher J.L. Mackie in his book Ethics: Inventing Right and Wrong [45]. Note
two things about this: ﬁrst, it implies that we have an account of how far sympathies
should stretch. This implies that we have a view on how far the circle of moral
concern should be and on how much of our sympathies others should receive.
Second, the stress on sympathy implies that human moral failings concern failings
of feelings, maybe a lack of imagination, maybe preoccupation with the self, and
with only a certain number of people close to us. Some such position is very
common and, as we have noted, may help to motivate claims that AI could help to
counter such human emotional limitations and bias by replacing or assisting human
judgement with a more impartial machine intelligence. However, a problem of
limited sympathies may also be met with a response that the answer to this question
is not to bypass sympathy and feeling but to expand one’s emotional response to
others.
The object of morality and the state of the world The necessity of morality given
a world of limited resources and human greed and/or short-sightedness also alerts us
that accounts of morality draw upon assumptions about the broad nature of the world
in which we live. For example, that we are striving to be happy; that achieving
happiness requires certain things; that resources are limited; that others are trying to
get what we also want; that other people are important to us in some way; that at
some point, we may need to rely on others; that the future is uncertain; that death,
however, is certain; etc. Hence, in considering AI, and especially futuristic notions of
AI, which may look to transformative visions of society and of our world, we may
ﬁnd that some of the basic tenets shaping our ideas of morality have fundamentally
altered. Perhaps by providing for our needs, some drivers of moral rules will be
lessened.
Alternatively, perhaps developments in AI may exacerbate some of the back-
ground conditions that shape our morality. Relative inequality is a strong indicator of
tensions and poor behaviour in a society [46]. Many features of the design of many
products using AI and of the production of AI in general are acting to concentrate
wealth in the hands of a few, and providing many low-grade jobs around the world
[47]. Furthermore, some design features of the online world are argued to be
provoking some of our worst behaviour, encouraging and harnessing the power of
the mob against the individual, and responsible for social contagion of ideas

[48]. Social media is widely thought to have an alarming role in the rise of mental
health problems, although the evidence is disputed [49, 50]. Many of the ethical
issues that technology is being called upon to solve are indeed caused or exacerbated
by technology. See Sect. 3.3.4, where we discussed the notion of iatrogenic harm.
(An alternative term for this may be ‘protection racket’.)

Here’s one relatively trivial although potentially irritating possible consequence
of the ease of virtually instant electronic communication. A friend and former
colleague, Susan Hogben, used to remark that in the old days, someone would
write a letter saying that their ship would be arriving into Sydney Harbour in the
afternoon of July 14, months in advance, and lo and behold, Aunt Marigold would
have travelled 500 km from Wagga Wagga to be there to meet it. These days, Aunt
Marigold would send a text at the last minute saying she couldn’t make it. Has the
ease with which we can notify others of a change in arrangements had any impact on
the tendency to value consistency and reliability in keeping to prior agreements
to meet?
I sometimes amuse myself by considering song lyrics and titles that would have to
be adjusted to update them to modern technology: Please Mr. Postman, Rikki Don’t
Lose That Number, Return to Sender, and many more. The plot drivers of so many
detective stories and of some of the most classic works of literature likewise hang on
failures or delays in communication. The original marathon race would never have
happened, as there would have been no need to run all those miles to deliver a
message; Romeo and Juliet would have got the message about the plot to pretend to
be poisoned and tragedy averted; you might likewise to amuse yourself by ﬁnding
examples of your own. On the other hand, modern technology provides numerous
new opportunities for communication failures.
Exercise 8
Imagine that AI has progressed so that we each only have to do 1 hour’s work a
week, and nobody wants for anything. Would this change our basic moral values in
any way?
Many of these issues will be explored further, especially in Chaps. 6–8, and 10.
The rest of this chapter looks in closer detail at the important question of how cases
for ethical consideration are selected and described.
4.4
Methodology in Applied Ethics: The Stories We Tell
Summary
The ways in which the cases used in applied ethics are selected and described are
critical. Understanding that these real cases are also stories, described in one way or
another, is an essential ﬁrst stage to improving methods in applied ethics. We need to
understand how character and agency are described and how the cases are framed.
The many tales about AI and robotics also provide a rich background against which
views are formed, and we need to understand the prominent themes present in such

tales and consider how these might impact ethical viewpoints; visual images like-
wise can have an inﬂuential impact. The careful use of science ﬁction for thinking
about AI ethics is discussed. The ways that cases are described and the manner in
which AI is presented can especially impact how agency, causation, and responsi-
bility are viewed, as well as how critical boundary questions are understood. In
describing cases, it is of utmost importance to ask what further information one
needs to understand the issues.

4.4.1
Introduction
Recall Sect. 4.1, where we looked at the simpliﬁed two-step ‘intuition plus reason’
method in applied ethics. Prior to this, cases must be selected and described. Cases
may be hypothetical, ﬁctional, or based on real life. In dealing with ethical questions,
especially in our ﬁeld where we need to think about as yet unrealised future
possibilities, we may need to consider hypothetical cases and imaginary scenarios.
Much ethical reasoning is counterfactual, consisting of asking the question, ‘what if
. . .’. There is thus the question of how we produce and describe hypothetical cases.
Real-life cases may seem more pressing in contrast. However, even these will be
presented to us in one way or another. Any description is going to be selective, even
of one’s own experience. We have seen in Sect. 4.2.1 how the recording of
categories will have important ethical implications. We thus need to consider, ﬁrst,
the selection of what cases are drawn to our attention and, second, how those cases
are described. We will ﬁrst review some general background issues.
Attention The question of attention to what is morally relevant is critical in ethics.
Moral failings can occur when a person knows full well what they ought to do, but
fails to act. Another common cause of moral failure is the failure of attention to what
is morally important and to what needs to be done. How a case is described will have
a large impact on what features attract our attention. Signiﬁcant to our interests in AI
ethics, the manner in which technologies may impact the quality and direction of our
attention is of critical importance.
In his book The Fiction of Bioethics, Tod Chambers examines how the ways in
which a case is described and its narrative structure can affect the conclusions that
are drawn from it [51]. Chambers had previously studied literature before turning to
bioethics. Philosophers are often, with some justiﬁcation, criticised for using thinly
drawn hypothetical examples to advance their theories. Chambers notes how even
with more richly drawn cases, the ways in which a story is told, the numbers,
motives, and descriptions of characters, and many other factors will help to deter-
mine ethical responses.
Exercise 9
Take one of the previous cases in this book, or any case relevant to AI ethics you
choose, and write it from different points of view. For example, you might like to

write it as ‘neutrally’ as possible (and this could be useful for considering what it
means to write ‘neutrally’), in a detective genre, as a comedy, or as a tragedy. Or
rewrite the story from the point of view of the different ‘characters’ involved.
Experiment with casting some into the role of villain, seeing some more sympathet-
ically, then reverse roles, etc. This could work well as a group exercise. Variations
could include writing different headlines or writing tweet-length summaries. Con-
sider what conclusions might have been drawn about the ethical issues and about
responsibility with different ways of telling the story. Consider how agency is
attributed, hinted at, or denied, to humans, groups of humans, and technologies in
different ways of telling the story. You might ﬁnd it interesting to look up various
accounts online and compare and contrast them. Our discussion of the LaMDA case
already gives some idea of the divergent ways in which a situation may be described.

Methods in Applied Ethics
Framing The way in which an issue is framed will have an impact upon how it is
assessed and understood [52]. For those who usually work within disciplines and
approaches that deal with sets of formal rules and aspire to objective, logical, and/or
empirically based ﬁndings, this may be a slightly unfamiliar idea, but framing
happens all the time, whether we are aware of it or not, and the issue of framing is
a well-established concept [53]. Classifying journal articles as systematic review
articles, opinion pieces, or research using some stated methodology will all act to
frame how its contents are read and assessed. ‘Retweets not endorsements’, ‘opin-
ions my own’, and so on serve a similar purpose. Likewise, whether a ﬁlm is
presented as a story, a documentary, or that half-way house, a docudrama, will
impact how we read and assess it. It is thus always helpful to consider how particular
issues and cases are being framed, how perhaps they might have been framed
differently, and what possible difference it may make.
Framing: AI in News Reports
Publishers of news reports know that readers may very well not read an article
to its end, and may even only see the headline. Newspaper headlines are one
key way in which stories about AI are framed. Here are some headlines from
June 2022 about the LaMDA sentience controversy.
Labelling Google’s LaMDA chatbot as sentient is fanciful. But it’s very
human to be taken in by machines [54].
Google engineer put on leave after saying AI chatbot has become
sentient [55].
Google sidelines AI engineer who claims AI chatbot has become
sentient [56].
No, Google’s AI is not sentient [57].
A Google software engineer believes an AI has become sentient. If he’s
right, how would we know? [58].
LaMDA and the power of illusion: The aliens haven’t landed . . . yet [59].

Exercise 10
Find a story about AI that particularly interests you, search for news reports, and
consider the impact of how the story is framed by headlines and by the opening
paragraph.
Distant or close? Framing includes how far out we stand and how far backwards
and forwards in time we go (and this includes even in our subject, ethics, and
portraying this all as new). It thus impacts the epistemological question of the best
stance from which to form ethical judgements. Framing includes how we
conceptualised what drives the unfolding of events, how widely in space we observe,
and whether we conceptualise ourselves as an outsider or insider observing things.
We will consider the relevance of this to how we address ethical issues in AI in
Chap. 7.
The embedded nature of much of the technology that we examine makes under-
standing the narrative structure and framing of cases all the more important. Tech-
nologies build upon other technologies; details are often hidden from the user or
become so familiar that they are lost to sight, as technology becomes an ubiquitous
part of the web of human interactions in the world. As we shall see, this has
important implications, including for how cause and effect and responsibility are
understood.
From example to rule Work in policy formation has shown how the particular
examples chosen as illustrations and as test cases can help determine how general
rules are formed. For example, there is often a tendency to use the most serious cases
as exemplars and extrapolate from these [60]. Unfortunately, this may lead to
standards that may be overly severe for less serious cases, and the cases picked
may have particular features that relevantly skew the conclusions drawn. Research
ethics regulations have often been developed using the model of medical research as
the foundation, but those working in social sciences have frequently pointed out that
this may lead to overly draconian and inappropriate guidelines for work with
different and often lower risks, and where there is a large variety of different
methodologies [61]. The generalisations and conclusions drawn from examples in
one domain may not translate well to another, as we indicated above in considering
how concepts interpreted in the context of medicine may not necessarily generalise
well to other contexts in which AI is applied. Hence, thinking broadly, communi-
cating and learning from others, and taking examples and cases from a wide range
will all be important parts of strategy in applied ethics.
4.4.2
Stories About AI
Stories about AI and how we interpret them form a background to how we think
about the real cases with us now and the real possibilities we may face in the future.
We have already considered the long history of myth, legend, and stories relating to

technology. Likewise, there is a plethora of more recent stories concerning AI, such
as tales concerning robots, the idea of computer simulation of minds, or the devel-
opment of disobedient technologies such as the dreaded computer in Stanley
Kubrick’s movie adaptation of Arthur C. Clarke’s 2001: A Space Odyssey with its
ominous phrase, ‘I’m sorry Dave, I’m afraid I can’t do that’ [62]. The prominent
stories about AI can be a means of exploring and testing our reactions to AI and will
also help to shape reactions to developments in AI.
162
4
Methods in Applied Ethics
An analysis of the themes behind stories concerning AI in the twentieth and
twenty-ﬁrst centuries in the anglophone West describes some central themes of hope
and fear, in four matched and opposing pairs [63]. The authors note that it will be
useful to understand how such polarised reactions can arise when considering AI for
three reasons: they could inﬂuence the goals of AI developers, inﬂuence public take-
up and acceptance of AI products, and inﬂuence how AI systems are regulated in
guiding policy makers and the stakeholders to whom policy makers are answerable.
To this we could explicitly add that they can inﬂuence thinking and debate in AI
ethics. The themes are the hope of immortality (or less ambitiously, life extension),
countered by the fears of a consequent inhumanity in how this is achieved; hope for
increased ease, with leisure from having tasks taken over by AI, countered by fears
of our obsolescence; hopes of gratiﬁcation, such as pleasurable pursuits provided by
AI, countered by fears of alienation from the ground of meaning in activities; and
hopes of dominance using AI, countered by fears of uprising, or the takeover of
humans by advanced forms of AI. Indeed, we shall see all these themes later,
especially in considering future applications of AI in Chaps. 10 and 11.
A key observation from this study is the extremes behind such narrative themes.
We have noted this in the hype with which AI may be depicted. Stories concerning
AI may contain more than one of these themes and often concern the strong tensions
between them. The inﬂuence of these themes could help explain some of the
difﬁculties in communication and in resolving ethical and policy issues regarding
AI, especially if there tend to be broad differences between how different groups,
say, developers versus the public, or different demographic groups, respond to and
advocate divergent themes. Since these themes also tend to be rather extreme, they
may diverge considerably from the more prosaic realities of AI in the real world.
Are we then best off just ignoring such stories? There are some complexities to
such a seemingly simple suggestion. Stories can be extremely useful in teaching
ethics, and science ﬁction has been used with success as a basis for teaching
computer ethics [64].
First, stories, ﬁlms, and art can help us to see questions from multiple different
angles and can help us to understand our own views, as well as the views of others
who differ from us. A word of advice, however, is that it is worth actually reading or
viewing classics rather than assuming common summaries of the issues they raise.
Otherwise, one may simply be buying into dominant narratives about classic works,
rather than the often more subtle details and varying interpretations that may be
found with a close reading. The use of ﬁction can be helpful in spurring imagina-
tions, and it may be useful to engage in different kinds of thought processes for those
who are mainly involved in practical and technical pursuits. Using stories that show

the attractions of opposing themes and the tensions between them can be helpful in
countering any tendency to see ethics as simply something to be learned, a kind of
‘to-do’ checklist of hurdles to navigate and facts to memorise. Stories, including
fantastical scenarios, can assist in freeing up discussion, and the removal from reality
can help to distance oneself from personal involvement. They can help us to ‘think
outside the box’.
4.4
Methodology in Applied Ethics: The Stories We Tell
163
Second, understanding how such narratives arise in ﬁction can help us see how
they might also inhabit our responses to AI in the real world. It is often easier to see
others doing this than to see it in ourselves. For instance, in making grandiose claims
about the possibilities of AI, or in apocalyptic pronouncements of doom attached to
every minor incremental development of technology. Watch out for this, and
carefully consider how helpful, misleading, or otherwise such narratives are. Some-
times thinking of the ‘worst-case’ or ‘best-case’ scenarios may have some use, but it
may distract. The story line may implicitly suggest parallels between humans and
machines, for example, that could be tested, and may implicitly suggest a position on
whether moral dilemmas presented by technology can or cannot be overcome.
Third, we are dealing with technology that is not yet with us, which is in the
prototype or development stage, and which we are still attempting to understand.
Even the technologies that we already use will have facets that we still do not
understand. Seeing it from novel aspects may help to deepen and enrich our view
of it. Nonetheless, it will always still be important to have a strong understanding of
the actual technologies and their impacts. Much of the ethics debate regarding AI
seems to veer between wild projections onto technology, to careful discussion of
technical details and the precise wording of technology, with bewildering changes of
voice and temperature.
4.4.3
Science Fiction, Ethics, and AI
Sci-ﬁis an obvious place to look for inspiration and imaginative responses to ethical
questions in AI. It has been used in teaching computer ethics with enthusiastic
responses from students, and a team engaged in this teaching has outlined several
beneﬁts [64]. They found that hypothetical scenarios taken from sci-ﬁcan enable
students to consider ethical issues free from personal involvement, can help to
overcome resistance towards ethics as a subject, and can help to free up their
imagination. This can be very useful in general both for approaching the complex-
ities so often involved in ethics and for helping students to consider the merits and
demerits of multiple ways of reading and responding to situations.
However, as we have already seen, other ﬁction can likewise have relevance for
many of the ethical issues in AI, for example, novels exploring industrialisation, or
indeed, any ﬁction exploring our understanding of human nature, which may enable
us to see more clearly how understandings of the human condition may impact our
reactions to AI. Science ﬁction may also explore situations that are either techno-
logically very unlikely, at least based on our current knowledge, or impossible. This

does not necessarily mean that there can still be useful lessons we can learn; it would
be foolish to respond to Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein’s Monster with the dismissive,
‘Ridiculous! The bits of human ﬂesh used to create the monster would have rotted,
and what about organ rejection, couldn’t happen!’
164
4
Methods in Applied Ethics
We must also recall the question of the very ways in which AI is presented to us,
and the broad distinction between focusing on the technology and the science and
engineering capabilities, versus the ideologies of AI and how it is projected and
imagined to be that we considered in Chap. 2. The use of science ﬁction may be a
great sounding board for considering these issues and how they may impact our
ethical responses. Fictional scenarios could also potentially feed into creating and
constructing ideologies of AI which may push the narrative and ethical judgements
around AI in certain directions. For example, some members of the transhumanist
VR chat community (yes, there is such a thing) have suggested that social VR has
potential for popularising transhumanism and morphological freedom, or the idea
that the particular forms our bodies take could be altered in a wide range of ways
[65]. Such explorations can also take overtly philosophical form. For example, the
philosopher David Chalmers wrote an essay originally published on the Matrix
website, ‘The Matrix as Metaphysics’, exploring philosophical issues, which also
have ethical implications [66]. We will return to Chalmer’s views on VR later in
Chap. 7.
Using science ﬁction to imaginatively consider ethical issues in AI also needs to
address the beneﬁts of reality testing: would some imagined fantastical piece of
technology actually work in practice, used in context, with actual human beings?
How might the ethical issues that spring to mind in considering sci-ﬁdepictions of
the use of AI relate to the ethical issues that arise when considering the details of
implementation of similar technology in practice? [67] Some recent work examining
science ﬁction representations of robot carers [68] suggests that these may help to
shift narratives of concern about the possible implementation of such robot carers
towards a consideration of relational issues, considering three stories in ﬁlm and
television, Robot & Frank [69], Big Hero 6 [70], and Humans [71], but we should be
aware that ﬁctional representations may be a poor guide to the realities of imple-
mentation in complex social and medical situations.
Exercise 11
Take any example of science ﬁction involving any form of AI or robotics, and ﬁrst
consider how it presents issues of value, including both detail and the broad
approach, for example, whether of fear or hope, whether issues are presented as
resolvable, etc. You may even want to write your own sci-ﬁ.
Second, consider the question of how precisely the technology involved might be
implemented in real life in the present day and what ethical and social issues might
arise in trying to solve any problems for a technology that actually worked; consider
what further questions you might need to ask about the situation you’ve envisaged.
How much of your response to the sci-ﬁversion is useful to this task?
Did different considerations arise when attempting to work out the details of
implementation?

4.4.4
Images of AI
The stories about AI are not simply portrayed in words. Images are also extremely
prominent and have come under scrutiny for the ways in which they might reveal
and disseminate values. Images of AI abound in ﬁlm, comic strips, images accom-
panying news reports, scientiﬁc accounts, websites, and so on. Ethical questions
about images of AI also concern AI itself, especially robotics. Those working in the
ﬁeld often moan that news reports about developments in AI frequently accompa-
nied by pictures of killer robots, no matter how dull the actual report is.
Exercise 12
Look up some news reports about AI and consider the appropriateness of any
accompanying images.
The ‘Creation of Adam’ meme is a consistent image used to illustrate story after
story regarding AI and, in particular, robots [72]. The meme consists of adaptations
of Michelangelo’s famous Creation of Adam on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel in
Rome. To the left, Adam reclines, somewhat languidly, with his hand outstretched
towards the hand of God on the right, pictured as an old, white-bearded man in the
sky, dressed in a ﬂowing pale-pink gown, and surrounded by various ﬁgures. The
ﬁngers of Adam and God almost touch.
These AI creation memes can readily be seen online: you have probably already
seen many if you are interested in AI. Variations include a robot stretching out a
hand to a man and digital representations of hands, sometimes with a spark of
electricity crossing between the hands. The robot and human hands appear on either
side, as if the possibility remains that man might create the robot, or the robot might
create man. A picture of equivalence between machine and creator is thus conjured
up, as well as the suggestion that by the creation of machine, humanity is acting as if
God. Perhaps by reference to such a famous painting, iconic of so much of Western
civilisation, a certain authority is lent to the grounding world view which it signals.
Such images can help to suggest ways of understanding AI and its relation to us, its
creator.
Exercise 13
Look up some AI creation myth images online and consider what picture of AI it
suggests to you. There are no wrong answers.
Interestingly, Michelangelo’s depiction of the creation of Adam is rather inaccu-
rate to the biblical text. There is no indication anywhere in the Bible that God has a
human form like this, let alone that he wears a baby-pink gown. The symmetry
between the creator and the created is thus overblown in Michelangelo’s depiction.
Moreover, life is not given to Adam by touch but is breathed into the clay out of
which the ﬁrst human was made (Genesis 2:7). (‘Adam’ in Hebrew can mean a
human of either sex.) Perhaps the notion of thinking of ourselves as fashioning a
being like us by means of technology thus also comes to mind a little too readily,
given that the most immediate way of making things is ‘by hand’. Only a few things,

such as ballads, balloons, and blowing out birthday candles, owe their existence to
our breath.
166
4
Methods in Applied Ethics
A general exercise then, to take forwards into all your thinking on AI ethics, is to
think carefully about the images of AI which surround us, and especially those which
accompany news or articles about AI, and consider how they might be impacting
assumptions, and framing how we think of AI.
The AI creation meme presents an image of the relation of AI to humans. Images
can be a very potent source for portraying AI as human in some way [73], but the
very idea of portraying AI as human to any degree has attracted controversy. Those
who consider that we would be better off viewing AI in terms of speciﬁc engineering
tasks might rue the very idea of portraying AI as if it were human. Even aside from
this issue, there are questions about the speciﬁcs of any such portrayal.
It is noticeable that many images focus on the brain, often with depictions of
neurones and strongly suggest parallels between neurones and electronic circuitry.
Put ‘AI’ into any search engine, and such pictures abound. The dominant colour is
consistently blue, a colour associated with intelligence and technology. The human
head is bald, and sometimes it’s not clear if this is intended as a portrayal of a human,
or of a robot. The suggestion might be implicit that human intelligence and artiﬁcial
intelligence are straightforward models of each other and that human intelligence is
all about the brain. Of course it is! I hear you cry. Not so fast. There are very tight
interactions between our bodies and our brains, between the functioning of our
bodies and the thoughts and feelings we experience. There may be important
consequences for air-brushing the body out of the picture. Later, we consider the
signiﬁcance of embodiment for ethics in more detail, especially in Chaps. 8, 10, and
11.
Any depiction of AI as human, any robot made intentionally humanoid, and any
AI-created voice will be particular. As we have seen, there have been debates and
controversies about the issues of race and sex concerning the representation of AI
and the reinforcing of stereotypes. Robots may have no human-like aspects at all,
may be toy-like, or may be more humanoid, sometimes with a typically male
appearance, at other times made to look female, and sometimes have typically
female ﬁgures. The toy-like robots typically look friendly; killer robots, not so
much. These are generally overtly ‘male’ in appearance. Does this say anything
about stereotypes of masculinity and femininity? Some researchers have questioned
the impact of robots that are designed to be white and that may display typical
Caucasian facial features [74]. Images accompanying articles about AI are fre-
quently in the dominant colour blue, as has been noted, but with white as the usual
contrast colour. Does this say anything about race?
The question of bias in algorithms is concerned in large part with how building
algorithms from past data may reinforce or even exacerbate adverse stereotypes that
disadvantage certain groups and individuals. Research on word embeddings ﬁnds
that biases such as common stereotyping of sex roles may be reproduced by machine
learning unless careful steps are taken to avoid it [75]. Biases in human trainers will
be passed on to any algorithms created [76]. There has been much concern about the
impact of the perceived gender of voice assistants, with fears that it may reinforce

stereotypes of ‘helpful’ females occupying service roles. The vocal features that tend
to discriminate between voices perceived as masculine or as feminine include not
just pitch, intonation, and volume but also typical sentence structure, with voices
seen as more masculine having shorter phrasing and content viewed as more
authoritative. Some companies producing voice assistants have claimed that market
research shows that what is wanted in an assistant is someone with the typical
feminine qualities of helpfulness, supportiveness, and trustworthiness. Conversely,
the voices of AI that produce medical advice or wins at Jeopardy are more likely to
be masculine, suggesting authority [77].
4.4
Methodology in Applied Ethics: The Stories We Tell
167
These typical gender traits are of course generalisations, and there is much
variation between individuals within any one class. Moreover, these debates are
complicated by different societal, cultural, and individual differences in beliefs about
and perceptions of gender and illustrate the complexity of different aims and
responsibilities. Much is a matter of interpretation. Placing feminine features on a
robot may be seen to reinforce the idea of using women as assistants. Or perhaps it
may bring about an association of women with high-end technology.
Responsibilities and aims in AI ethics The complexity of the disputes and the
different responses illustrate an important aspect of ethical debates in AI: the
question of what the end aim of work in AI ethics may be and how responsibilities
are seen. Many in industry see the issue in terms of how to attract and retain their
customer base [78]. Others consider that such stereotyping is harmful, and may aim
to eradicate it, perhaps by the use of voices that sound gender ambiguous
[79, 80]. The questions of sex and gender and how society is best arranged around
these issues are of great complexity, with a very wide range of views on the issue.
Discussions of ‘feminism’ may overlook that it encompasses a very wide range of
theories, with contrasting and even directly conﬂicting viewpoints [81]. This also
perhaps presents an illustration of an issue where the use of a wide range of examples
might bring certain aspects to light. Much discussion of the perceived gender of
voice assistants has focused on the very largest corporations, which naturally have
wide inﬂuence and are often perceived to not necessarily be acting in the public
interest, with concerns that they should be held to account. However, one might
fairly ask what the responsibilities of, say, a small commercial entity are towards the
end goal of helping to eradicate sex-role stereotyping, especially if this means they
may lose out ﬁnancially.
AI, Sex, and Human Embodiment
Future visions of AI may include the portrayal of feminine and masculine
traits, but there is also a theme of gender-neutrality and of an ‘escape’ from
embodiment. Some conceptions of human nature stress the mental and down-
play or ignore our physical embodiment, and this may be linked to certain
conceptions and valuation of intelligence, as we shall see more in Chap. 5.

AI, and of how AI may be able to improve upon humans, stress the limits that
our biology places upon us. This too tends towards an ungendered, unsexed
view of humanity.

Methods in Applied Ethics
On some views, the division of human beings into male and female is a
basic category of our being. This does not necessarily give rise to any
particular views about precise differences between men and women and
their roles and responsibilities, but may nonetheless reinforce on the signiﬁ-
cance of such a distinction and of our biological, sexed natures.
Food for thought: the detailed implementation of AI is criticised for
reinforcing and even amplifying sex and gender roles. Conversely, some
conceptions of AI and of its values, and some futuristic visions of AI, may
imagine a disembodied future, free entirely of notions of sex or gender.
Exercise 14
The mystical poet William Blake wrote these words:
For Mercy has a human heart,
Pity a human face,
And Love, the human form divine,
And Peace, the human dress. [82]
Could we recognise such qualities in a sophisticated robot? Could giving facial
features to a robot help us to see such qualities to a machine, or could it fool us?
Consider how we fail to see such qualities in some human faces.
Joanna Bryson has argued that robots are artefacts that are wholly owned by
humans and that it is a mistake to humanise them in any manner [82]. By doing so,
we may make errors about how they function, allocate resources poorly, and falsely
attribute responsibility to them rather to humans. Moreover, she argues that by
humanising robots, we risk dehumanising human beings.
One can see the complexity of these issues and the wide range of reactions
possible. One might respond to the claims that robots tend to have Caucasian facial
features by designing robots with facial characteristics more typical of other popu-
lation groups. If Bryson is right that we should treat robots as if they are things which
we wholly own, then it will probably be better to keep human-like features off robots
altogether. Attempts to give robots faces that are neither masculine nor feminine are
likely to fail because many individuals may persist in interpreting such faces one
way or another.
Exercise 15
Take the case of a robot carer for a frail elderly person or any person with a physical
need for assistance. Consider the various tasks such a robot might be used for:
fetching drinks; answering the front door; providing companionship through simple
conversations; providing stimulation such as choosing music to play, radio
programmes to listen to, or various games; making emergency calls if needed; and

so on. Now consider different possible robot designs: simple humanoid features such
as a basic face with simple eyes and a mouth and one of those rather robotic voices;
realistic human-like features; and features and a voice designed by an AI to simulate
as closely as possible the person’s now deceased spouse, or their son or daughter
who lives a 3-h drive away and visits once a month.

Methodology in Applied Ethics: The Stories We Tell

Now consider the pros and cons of the different possible robot designs and any
ethical issues raised. Don’t forget to consider the rather different nature of the tasks
such a robot might perform.
4.4.5
Describing Ethical Questions: Causation,
Responsibility, and Ethics
We have already seen an example of how agency may be highlighted or not, given to
machines or to humans (see Sect. 3.2). When we describe situations, we routinely
use words that attribute action and imply intention. These then will carry implica-
tions concerning agency and responsibility. If we had to describe a situation simply
in terms of a sequence of movement, it would take forever, and not in the way that
Lord of the Rings or War and Peace take a long time to read: it would be utterly,
utterly boring. ‘Her right hand raised vertically 6.37 centimetres and then extended
diagonally to the right a further 10.56 centimetres. It descended by 4.13 centimetres.
Her ﬁngers and thumb moved into a position around the handle of a mug and then
moved slightly inwards. The ﬁngers made close contact with the handle of the mug.
Meanwhile, a faint sound of lawnmowers ﬁlled the room, the curtain moved slightly
in the wind, she felt a slight itch in her nose, remembered she had forgotten her
packed lunch . . . .’ You get the gist.
Elizabeth Anscombe’s book Intention spells out an example of a man moving his
arm up and down which has the effect of pumping poisoned water into a cistern that
feeds the drinking water in a house where a group of party leaders are plotting to
exterminate Jews and start a world war [83]. There are also many other side effects of
the man’s actions: the shadows falling, the multiple impacts on those affected by the
death of the party leaders, and the squeezing sound of the pump. The way in which
such a case is described, including the attribution of speciﬁc intentions to the man,
will impact how we attribute causation and responsibility.
Attributing responsibility to an agent generally involves attributing their actions
as the cause or as a contributing causal factor and attributing either intention or
culpable lack of care. How we assign these is going to be immensely complex and
hence will depend heavily on what is picked out and how it is described. Even the
assignment of physical causes to material events, such as the cause of a ﬁre, will
depend upon picking out something as cause from a set of background conditions
[84]. A match will only spark a ﬁre given the right set of background conditions. So
when is a condition a ‘background’ condition? Much of this will depend upon what
we expect to be the case. We are warned not to light a match near combustible

materials such as on garage forecourts, but if someone has stored a can of petrol with
the lid off somewhere where it’s not expected, what is the cause of the resultant ﬁre
when someone lights a candle? Note that as new technology is introduced, what we
consider to be a ‘background condition’ and what we consider to be the cause may
shift.
170

Methods in Applied Ethics
Time scales are critical in attributions of causation and responsibility; it matters
where a story starts [85]. For instance, consider the Tay Chatbot example discussed
in Sect. 2.4.5. Attending to the incident only from the time of launch might eclipse
questions about responsibility for decisions leading up to its release and responsi-
bility for details of its development. The very way in which technology may
facilitate the collection of certain kinds of data may act in ways to skew how a
situation appears and how causation is attributed. For example, increasing the ease of
collection of health data from tracking and self-monitoring by individuals may lead
to an increased emphasis on individual responsibility for disease, perhaps
emphasising ﬁtness, and control over diet, and ignoring the societal and environ-
mental contributions. Similar claims have been made with regard to the rise of
genetic information leading to a notion of ‘genetic responsibility’ [86]. This may
be beneﬁcial for some, yet may shift attribution of responsibility for health in ways
detrimental to others. Carefully designed and rigorous studies show that social class
and other factors may have a much larger impact on health than other factors; the
emphasis on the collection of physiological and other data enabled by health tracking
apps may potentially increase perceptions of individual responsibility for health
[87, 88].
The LaMDA case, which we considered earlier, shows the considerable impor-
tance of understanding how we attribute causal responsibility and the strong ten-
dency to attribute agency in how we understand and approach technology in
particular. Some commentators appeared to cast scorn on those who worried that
LaMDA might indeed be developing sentience, yet the readiness to do this is entirely
understandable, and considering this, one might then form the view that companies
working on such technologies should anticipate such an issue. The suspicions among
many members of the public that Google must be ‘up to something’ are also rather
understandable.
Hence, the importance of how cases are described for forming ethical judgements
concerning a situation can hardly be overstated.
Consider the Guidelines for Indigenous Centred AI mentioned in Sect. 2.9. Many
of these have implications for how situations and events are described. The principle
of locality notes that local knowledge is very important to indigenous communities.
Hence, this may mean that a closer focus on speciﬁc local issues may shape how a
situation arose and is understood. The principle of relationality and reciprocity has
direct implications for how agency and responsibility may be described. It notes how
indigenous knowledge is often relational and emphasises how AI belongs within
wider systems of relationships, again emphasising the speciﬁcity of different com-
munities. The principle of responsibility, relevance, and accountability notes the
strong concern of indigenous people for their communities. Again, this is likely to
impact upon how cases are described and how causation is attributed. Understanding

the situations of indigenous communities may require understanding historical
factors going back many generations.
4.4
Methodology in Applied Ethics: The Stories We Tell
171
Describing cases: ‘the robot did it’ Attributing causation in a complex situation is
a complex mix of interests, concerns, and focus [89]. The ways in which we
highlight a feature of a complex situation as a cause may depend on many factors,
including salience and novelty. The ‘new kid on the block’, or the last thing to enter
the mix, is frequently seen as the ‘cause’, but this is not necessarily helpful or
informative. Did the failure of the ‘O’ rings at low temperature ‘cause’ the Space
Shuttle Challenger disaster, or was the ‘cause’ the failures of management and
communication? [90] Likewise, we often pick out the most salient, the most visible
to us, or the most different, as the likely cause of an anomalous event.
Because technology is new, shiny, and different, we often think of it as ‘the cause’
of progress, but this may be unhelpful and inaccurate. Consider Deep Blue’s win
over chess champion Garry Kasparov in 1997. Did a computer beat a human being?
Or did a large team of scientists who built Deep Blue, together with the accumulated
knowledge of a great many chess masters, beat one human being? [91, p. 34]. If we
describe the situation as one man, Kasparov, battling it out against a vast team of
humans, this changes the perception somewhat. It looks a little bit like cheating.
The ways in which technology is often embedded in vast systems and may have a
convoluted and often opaque pathway of production means that analysing and
attributing responsibility and the causal contribution of different aspects may be a
tortuous enterprise. Any tendency to view technology in terms of agency will also
likely signiﬁcantly impact the attribution of causation and responsibility to a set of
circumstances. Human beings have a very strong tendency to see agency in move-
ments and to see faces in things. Indeed, there are multiple Twitter accounts called
variations of ‘faces in things’.
These issues also help to illustrate why the question of transparency in AI must
extend far beyond the more technical question of how a particular instance of
machine learning functions but must include transparency of the wider system within
which the AI in question is embedded.
Describing cases: what you don’t know, and what you don’t know
you don’t know This chapter has strongly argued that it is critical to pay attention
to the way in which cases used as examples in discussing ethics, forming judge-
ments, and making decisions including policy are selected and described. However,
to do this will involve knowledge, knowledge one may not have. The issue of
transparency is one major stumbling block. In cases involving technology, informa-
tion that is private to the companies involved may be critical. In any case involving
people—that is, every case—there will be the question of what a person’s thoughts
and motivations are. This can be a problem even for our own thoughts. In many
cases, specialist knowledge may be needed. For example, we have looked at several
cases involving people living with dementia, where understanding of the condition
and of its impact on different individuals will be crucial. In addition, this

understanding will require many different perspectives, since, as we have seen, there
are multiple impacts of such a condition, medical, psychological, social, and so on.
172

Methods in Applied Ethics
A critical strategy for any work in applied ethics then involves considering what
other information we need about any particular case or set of issues and where we
might get this information from. What don’t we know?
Exercise 16
Consider one or more of the exercises in Chap. 2 which concerned people living with
dementia, such as Exercises 6, 8, 9, 10, or 11. What else would you need to know to
understand what ethical questions were at stake, in the particular example(s) you
have chosen? Consider who you might turn to for information or opinion about the
issues. Consider what other kinds of cases you might want to look at to gain a fuller
understanding of the questions involved.
Comment on the exercise Many people have some experience of dementia, per-
haps through a family member who is living with the condition, or through personal
experience. However, it is a complex and very variable condition that takes various
forms and that can affect individuals rather differently. Moreover, many of the
questions around the use of any technology for diagnosis, research, or care need to
take into account a wider context. These may include but are not limited to the social
attitudes towards dementia and towards the elderly in general, which can vary
greatly depending upon cultural, economic, and social conditions as well as indi-
vidual factors. The background question of healthcare provision and social care is
also a major factor. Those working in technology may sometimes push ideas a
considerable way towards development, often with the ﬁnest of intentions, without
always careful consultation and consideration of the situation of those they are trying
to assist.
Other voices, and your own voice Other perspectives are vital. So is yours. Taking
the views of others into account does not mean that yours do not matter and should
not mean that you fail to speak up when you have a hunch that something is wrong.
Developing your capacity to do so could one day play a major role in averting
disaster. Never forget that sheer chance may put you in a position of critical
importance where you could make a real difference.
Ethics cases: trolley problems and other stories As necessary as it is to recognise
the need for full and rich descriptions of cases, in reality we will never get the ‘full’
picture, and, as we have noted in relation to moral relevance, some details will not be
relevant. (Working out which are, and which are not, is not necessarily easy.) It may
often be very helpful to focus on speciﬁc details and certain aspects only for the
purpose of considering which aspects of a case are especially pertinent to a
judgement.
Consider the well-known ‘trolley problems’ in ethics. The popularity of these
originate from the work of Philippa Foot, who worked at Somerville College,
Oxford, in the twentieth century and whose work was an important contribution to
developing interest in applied moral philosophy [92]. I also vividly recall trolley

problems being described in class by the philosopher Richard Hare, who had been a
prisoner of war in the Second World War forced to work on the notorious Thai-
Burma railway and who described real-life situations of loose trolleys careering
down the tracks. A classic trolley problem involves considering a train on a track,
with the possibility of averting its course. If it goes straight ahead, a certain number
of people will be killed (or etc.). If it is deviated to the other line, something different
will happen.
4.5
Key Points
173
These imaginary exercises hold various things constant and simplify the possible
actions. The use of a train track means that only two things can happen. (Although
some imaginative types sometimes propose derailment or other left-ﬁeld interven-
tions.) There is usually only one agent involved in making a decision. Decisions
have to be made instantly. The scenario usually asks for a choice, and there is seldom
any follow-up or what one might call a ‘debrief’ on the situation. The fate of the
potential victims is often as near certain as possible, since being run over by a train is
very unlikely to result in survival. The situation is also set up so that not making a
decision is tantamount to making a decision, since there will be an inevitable
outcome of failing to act.
When drawing conclusions from such hypothetical scenarios, it is essential to
consider how a case involving decision-making and judgement is set up and reﬂect
on how the parameters of any scenario may impact the conclusions that are
drawn [93].
Exercise 17
We will examine the MIT Moral Machines experiment further in Chap. 7. As a
preliminary, consider some of the basic design elements of the experiment described
in Sect. 4.2.
4.5
Key Points
Which cases are selected for consideration and how they are described can make a
critical difference in forming ethical judgements. This can impact what features are
understood to be relevant; how agency, causation, and responsibility are assigned;
and how cases are generalised.
The language that we use to describe AI, robots, and technology in general can
make a large difference in what moral issues we see in a situation. Language may
help to mask or to reveal ethical questions.
Science ﬁction can be a rich source of material for debating and understanding
ethical issues in AI but must be used wisely, precisely because of the manner in
which AI is portrayed in ﬁction, ﬁlm, and image can have a powerful hold on how
we view ethical questions. Other ﬁction can also provide insights.
Certain basic assumptions about the nature of ethics will inﬂuence how ethical
problems are understood and how they are resolved (or not). For example, many

assume that ethics must be ‘universal’ in some way, but this idea can be understood
in different ways and is not itself universally held.
174
4
Methods in Applied Ethics
The question of whether or not there can be genuine moral dilemmas and whether
ethical values and judgements can be formalised and precisely expressed in language
also shape how argument and discussion in ethics proceed.
There are different ways of understanding the purpose, or object, of morality. The
very developments of technology may have a signiﬁcant impact on factors that
previously or currently go towards forming the issues that ethics addresses as well
as our ethical responses.
Take care with the assumption that we need to seek ‘the’ answer to ethical
questions.
Perhaps the most important take-away from this chapter is that it matters how
cases for consideration are selected, and how they are described.
A critical ﬁrst question is to ask yourself what relevant information you do not
have and consider where to go and who to ask to ﬁnd out more.
4.6
Educator Notes
Students working at different levels and with different background interests may
approach this chapter in very different ways.
A basic key point that all students should take away from this chapter is the
importance of considering the ways in which ethical issues are presented to us. For
those with less time, this point can be explained and understood through examining
the points about images of AI and/or about narrative structures and how ethical
issues, issues of agency and responsibility, are portrayed, using news articles or
science ﬁction as examples. Students should be encouraged to see the complexity of
ethical issues and the importance of considering alternative viewpoints.
A second key point for all students is to understand the importance of applying
judgement and thought to our ethical responses, but also to understand that how such
reasoning is precisely understood is an open question.
Given the importance of understanding the impact of our own worldviews on
how we identify and interpret ethical issues, the material inviting students to
consider the viewpoints expressed in the Indigenous AI Protocols could also be
used as a springboard to extend such an exercise to include consideration of any
other cultural or religious frameworks on how ethical issues in AI are understood.
Any students with backgrounds in literature, journalism, or the visual arts, and
similar subjects, may wish to concentrate on exploring the issues around narrative
structure and visual image, carefully considering how this may impact how issues of
value are portrayed and understood. Such students would likely be able to bring
further material and understanding to these issues beyond what we have had time to
explore here. This would serve as a concrete illustration of the value of different
perspectives on these ethical issues in AI.

Encouraging students to look again at cases they have considered from previous
chapters can be useful in enabling them to see how their understanding and view-
points may develop.
Debate and extended project and essay topics Exercise 1 on the LaMDA case
would provide a focus point for debate and might work well if students were
instructed to take one side or another, regardless of their initial response. Exercise
9 could work well as a project for small groups working together who can then
compare and contrast their answers. Exercises 10, 11, and 12 would work well in
class, especially if students prepared examples to bring and talk about. Exercise
11 might make an interesting essay topic for students interested in narrative accounts
of AI.

Humans and Intelligent Machines:
Underlying Values
Abstract Many questions in AI ethics involve the comparison of human beings
with machines that display aspects of intelligence. We thus need to understand how
humans are understood and how intelligence is understood. We examine what is
meant by intelligence noting the range of different ways in which it is characterised,
why we value intelligence, and some ethical implications of answers to these
questions. In particular, it is important to note that some accounts of intelligence
used in AI are instrumental, understanding intelligence as the capacity effectively to
reach goals. The second part of the chapter examines theories of human nature.
These underlie many questions in ethics yet may remain relatively unexamined.
Issues outlined of relevance to AI ethics include questions concerning the place of
human beings in the natural world; claims of particular roles that humans may have;
claims that human beings have some essential nature; claims about the relationship
of humans to the mind and to embodiment; the boundaries and limits to human
nature; and claims about divisions within human nature, our strengths and weak-
nesses, and how humans may be improved. Examples and exercises are given that
illustrate how these issues impact practical questions in AI ethics.

Introduction
Summary
This chapter aims to provide a survey of some of the questions concerning how we
value intelligence and how human nature is understood, which underlie many of the
central and most perplexing questions in AI ethics. Analysing these issues can assist
with understanding divergent viewpoints.
Many questions in AI ethics concern what happens when human beings or aspects of
human action, thought, and decision-making are enhanced or replaced, in part or in
whole, by the work of machines that manifest aspects of intelligence. Hence,
assessing the ethics of AI involves, inter alia, implicit or explicit comparisons

between humans and intelligent machines. Any comparison of interest to us will be
explicitly normative. Projects working on AI research and application generally
involve normative claims about why the project is worth pursuing, as well as
whether the means adopted to achieve their goals are well chosen and justiﬁed.
182

Humans and Intelligent Machines: Underlying Values
These explicit or implicit comparisons between humans and machines occur both
at the general and speciﬁc levels. The aspiration that AI will recreate human
intelligence, perhaps even create beings ‘like us’, rests upon claims about the extent
of its capacity to mimic, reproduce, or even exceed, human-level intelligence, as well
as on the purpose and the value of doing so. Particular projects in AI typically do not
make such general claims, and indeed those working on them may positively
disavow them; this is probably the more common attitude. Nonetheless, ethical
questions will still arise with these more modest projects, which require an assess-
ment of the use of AI to replace or enhance human intelligence on a case-by-case
basis. There are obvious safety issues involved, concerning whether the AI is
functioning as expected, but wider questions too, about the comparison of intelli-
gence in machines and in humans and about what is gained and what is lost in using
intelligent machines alongside humans, or instead of humans.
Hence, this chapter will examine these questions underlying AI ethics, the
questions of how intelligence is valued, and the complex issue of human nature.
The latter is essential: for how can we compare and contrast humans with machines
without a framework for understanding and for valuing humans? There is a close
connection between the question of how we value intelligence and how we under-
stand human nature, since our cognitive capacities have generally been seen as a
central distinguishing feature of human beings.
These questions have been discussed since the dawn of philosophy and of
theology. There are endless opportunities for taking these debates and questions
further. There is much to be explored in the technical details of what precisely AI can
achieve, and much work is currently underway in the intersecting ﬁelds of cognitive
science, neuroscience, and artiﬁcial intelligence, all of which can help to shed light
on the ethical questions of AI. There are vast libraries and schools of thought from
around the world and throughout history on the subject of human nature, different
and sometimes conﬂicting assumptions made about human nature from different
disciplinary perspectives, and debates within religion as well as philosophy and
social sciences such as sociology, psychology, and anthropology.
Accounts of human nature may be held implicitly and are often held very deeply
but may help to explain some of the different responses to some of the central
questions of AI ethics. These include questions such as whether AI will take away
our agency, reduce us to slaves, enhance what is most valuable, help us to achieve
perfection, render us babbling nincompoops ruled by the technological elite, and
divide humanity into two groups: the enhanced and the ‘normies’.
Casual mention of this chapter to others while in the process of writing it has
tended to provoke the response, ‘Are you going to discuss [ﬁll in favourite thinker or
school of thought]?’ The answer, sadly, is probably no, just because there are so
many to include. Views about the value of intelligence and assumptions about
human nature often help to identify differences between cultures and worldviews.

One approach would be to present a comprehensive smorgasbord of different value
systems from around the world. This would necessarily be incomplete and doubtless
partial. Rather, the approach I have taken is to try to parse out some of the central
questions that mark areas of commonality and difference and hence help to facilitate
further conversations and dialogues beyond this book.

By examining the foundations of one’s own views and the ﬁssures, unanswered
questions, and places of certainty and uncertainty that lie beneath these, the better
prepared one hopefully is for fruitful dialogue with others. The choice of examples
and thinkers given here is hence personal and inevitably biased, but the invitation to
the reader is to use this as a framework for further exploration.
The strategy in this chapter is to raise some of the central questions to consider
about the nature and value of intelligence and about human nature, focusing on
issues where the answers given have relevance for how we understand and address
many of the ethical questions in AI. Indeed, two questions that arise are whether we
would ever be able to build a ‘complete’ picture of human nature and whether we
will ever be able fully to understand intelligence. After all, why would we presume
that our intelligence is sufﬁcient to be able fully to understand itself? Nonetheless, by
means of exploring the questions that have produced points of contention, agree-
ment, and disagreement, we can add to our toolkit for advancing debate and
discussion. This will often involve unearthing common assumptions and sometimes
radical disagreements.
5.2
The Nature and Value of Intelligence
Summary
This section asks an essential question for understanding ethical issues in the
development and deployment of AI: what is intelligence, and why do we value it?
There are many different ways of deﬁning intelligence. Instrumental accounts that
see intelligence in terms of the efﬁcient achievement of goals are common but not
universal among those developing AI. Differences in accounts of the nature of
intelligence have implications for how the project of AI is conceived, for how the
intelligence of humans is compared to AI, for how human beings are valued, and for
how the achievements of civilisation and society are understood and valued.
5.2.1
What Is Intelligence, and Why Do We Value It?
The general question of why we would use or develop AI rests upon an answer to
this question: if AI is artiﬁcial intelligence, why do we value intelligence such that
we wish to create artiﬁcial versions of it? Why do we value our own intelligence so
much that we wish to try to enhance or extend it using AI? As with so many

questions in philosophy, it sounds ridiculous even to pose such a question. Naturally,
we value intelligence, but why? And how much? And how does the value we give to
intelligence compare to other things we value?
184

Humans and Intelligent Machines: Underlying Values
Intelligence, thought, and wisdom Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig begin their
textbook Artiﬁcial Intelligence, A Modern Approach by noting that the very name of
our species, Homo sapiens, reﬂects our intelligence [1, p. 1], although Homo sapiens
is generally translated as ‘man the wise’. They add that we have tried to understand
how we think for thousands of years, and now the ﬁeld of AI is trying not just to
understand thinking but to build intelligent entities.
It is no doubt true that our intelligence is important to us, but what precisely that
intelligence is, why it is important, and how central it is to our understanding of
ourselves are questions to which there are many different responses. Already we
have not one idea, but three: thinking, intelligence, and wisdom. These are different
concepts, with different values attached to them.
Is all thinking intelligence? Trying to address this question, I watch the seemingly
random content of my mind: wondering if it’s time for lunch and if so, what to have;
noticing how satisfying the colour contrast between the red and purple tulips in the
vase on my desk is; worrying if I can manage to explain this section of the book well
enough; realising I haven’t put my shoes on yet as I become aware of my feet;
and more.
Exercise 1
What differences are there between thought, intelligence, and wisdom?
What aspects of thinking should be included in intelligence? Idly daydreaming is
surely thought, but is it intelligence? Can you explain your answer?
What is the difference, if any, between intelligence and wisdom? List some
people you think of when thinking of intelligence and some when thinking of
wisdom. Does wisdom require intelligence? What more is needed?
Before we go on, how would you deﬁne intelligence? How would you deﬁne
wisdom?
Multiple deﬁnitions of intelligence and intelligence as goal-directed The difﬁ-
culty and controversy of our subject can be illustrated by the sheer number of
deﬁnitions of intelligence that exist. Shane Legg and Marcus Hutter collected over
70 different deﬁnitions of intelligence, showing some overlapping features and some
common approaches, but also considerable divergence [2]. Our aim here then is
certainly not to come up with ‘the’ correct deﬁnition of intelligence. Indeed, there
may be appropriately different deﬁnitions for different purposes.
One broad approach to deﬁning intelligence is via its necessary constituents, such
as the use of memory, comparison, understanding, reasoning, abstract thinking,
problem-solving, adaptation to new contexts, and facility in dealing with cognitive
complexity. The capacity to learn and to adapt to new circumstances is frequently
included in deﬁnitions of intelligence as well as the capacity to improve one’s
learning. Other approaches attempt to capture the essence of what intelligence

achieves. An account by Legg and Hutter, produced from the examination of
numerous accounts from different ﬁelds, gives an informal deﬁnition in terms of
the capacity of an agent to reach goals in a large range of circumstances [3]. This
captures an approach common within AI. For example, it is close to the account
given by Russell for humans that their intelligence is measured by their ability to
reach their objectives.
5.2
The Nature and Value of Intelligence
185
Goals, artiﬁcial intelligence, and human intelligence Legg and Hutter’s deﬁni-
tion is given in the context of AI but refers simply to ‘an agent’, whereas Russell
purports to give a deﬁnition of human intelligence. Should we be thinking of these as
the same or as different? Whatever your answer, it is important to be clear.
The deﬁnitions of intelligence collected by Legg and Hutter are grouped into
18 collective deﬁnitions, 35 deﬁnitions by psychologists, and 18 deﬁnitions by AI
researchers. Of these, 2 of the 35 psychologist deﬁnitions mention goals, in contrast
to 9 of the 18 deﬁnitions by AI researchers which mention goals. One could hazard a
guess that this disparity may arise because the AI researchers are in the business of
constructing AI systems to achieve their ends and hence are ipso facto creating AI to
achieve their own goals. We can ask if this is necessarily appropriate as an account of
human-level intelligence.
It may be that the very practice of artiﬁcial intelligence serves to intensify the
emphasis on the achievement of goals as a hallmark of intelligence. Could this then
be reﬂected back to how we assess and understand human intelligence? As life
imitates art, could it also imitate technology?
Goals, instrumentality, and the value of intelligence Note that an account of
intelligence in terms of goals is concerned with what intelligence is used to lead to. It
implicitly values intelligence in terms of the end state that it produces rather than in
terms of the process itself. This is an instrumental account of the value of intelli-
gence. An instrumental conception of intelligence immediately gives an answer to
the question of why we value intelligence: because it is a way of achieving our goals.
Stuart Russell envisages that AI could be used to solve some major goals and
hence that its value can be measured in terms of its potential success. He works out
an example [4, pp. 98–99], the goal of raising the living standard of all human beings
to that seen as respectable in a developed country, which he chooses, ‘somewhat
arbitrarily’ as the 88th percentile in the USA. Using economic modelling, he
calculates this as roughly a tenfold increase to $750 trillion per year, with the future
net income with a net present value of approximately $13,500 trillion, as
representing a rough idea of how valuable human-level AI might be in terms of
the achievements it could deliver.
It is necessary to ask if these instrumental goals are the only reason we value
intelligence. Russell is only attempting to produce a rough and ready example, so it
would be unfair to pull this apart too severely. What additional questions would you
need to know about this imagined future? And in this future, what manner of value
might be placed on intelligence?

186
5
Humans and Intelligent Machines: Underlying Values
Goal and process There is a strong case for saying that we value intelligence in
humans for its own sake as well as for the beneﬁts it can give us. One reason for this
may be the human trait of curiosity or wonder, which incites us to explore, acquire
knowledge, and seek new experiences, all just for their own sake. The philosophers
who considered the contemplation of eternal truths to be the highest form of life
captured in an abstract way what for others may be manifest more concretely or
prosaically in bird spotting, pub quizzes, or playing various games of skill: we may
enjoy not just the product of intelligence but also the process of thinking. The goal of
intelligence may sometimes be thought itself, rather than anything external to
thought. This will have important ethical implications for certain questions, such
as some of questions concerning the use of AI in the place of our own powers of
thought.
Moreover, the path of seeking value in thought and in the life of the mind is a
recurring and enduring one throughout different civilisations and in the teachings of
many of the world’s most revered thinkers and schools of thought, such as Buddhism
and Daoism. Contemplation has been seen as the route to wisdom or enlightenment
and as an end in itself. Both Plato and Aristotle considered the philosophical life to
be the best. For Plato, contemplation of the eternal forms gave access to a realm of
truth beyond the material realm [5]. Aristotle considered that the intellectual life of
contemplation was the surest route to happiness (although he did consider that there
were other necessities, such as friends with whom to share one’s life, but such
friends would be able also to share in the life of the mind) [6, 7]. One motivator for
ﬁnding happiness in such a way is that it provides a surer route than seeking
happiness through material comforts and other worldly means, since these are
more subject to the vagaries of fortune. Hence, such an approach places high
value on the intellect as a process and inherently satisfying, rather than viewing it
as a means to efﬁciently gain some further end, and, moreover, tends to downplay
the importance of merely material goals [7].
The contrast with the example given by Russell of using intelligence to produce a
world full of middle-income materialists could scarcely be greater, but perhaps AI
could help to iron out the twists and turns of fate and fortune that render seeking
happiness through material means so prone to disaster. Could AI also be the answer
to those who ﬁnd the life of the mind a triﬂe boring and wish for a safer bet on
gaining worldly goods? The astute observer will also note that the life of contem-
plation envisaged by Plato and Aristotle depended critically on a large population of
labourers, many of whom were slaves, not to mention their wives. Contemplation
needs a material underpinning. So perhaps it is not ‘either-or’ for the value we place
on human cognition and intelligence, but ‘both-and’.
Exercise 2
Have you ever struggled over a crossword puzzle, or Sudoku, or similar, and had
someone else lean over your shoulder and say, ‘Huh, you dope, that’s easy’, and
write in the solutions as you beg them to leave you to ﬁgure it out for yourself?
Would we ever design an AI to do all our crossword puzzles for us? Probably not.
Could Plato have used an AI to do his contemplation of the Eternal Forms for him?

Consider the difference between occasions when we would appreciate having our
intellectual efforts undertaken by another person or by a machine and when we
would not.

Intelligence, Goals, and Context
An anecdote about the time when my friend Margaret failed her Domestic
Science exam, the only one in the class to do so. I still remember the look of
stunned surprise on her face when the results were announced. Her task had
been to prepare a supper dish using cheese. She put a potato in the oven, and
when it was baked, cut it in half and put grated cheese on it. She executed this
to perfection, well within the time limit.
However, the teacher failed her on the grounds that she had not given
herself a sufﬁciently complex goal. From the perspective of passing a cooking
exam, perhaps she should have been cannier, but she came from a family of
eight children, and as one of the eldest, often cooked supper for the whole
family, and had doubtless done more cooking than most of the other girls in
the class who’d gained top marks with elaborate dishes, hence her response of
indignation to the exam results. Cheesy baked potatoes are perfectly delicious,
quick to prepare, cheap, and nutritious, and most children love them. Starting
to look somewhat more intelligent, eh. Context matters.
More generally, the ways in which we judge machine intelligence, intelli-
gence in a formal context (such as an exam, or an IQ test), and intelligence
within the less formal, complex context of life, with multiple competing goals
and a range of constraints, may be somewhat different. One of the questions
that this example raises is: what precisely were the goals Margaret should have
had, and the teacher should have been testing?
Consider these issues when examining concrete applications of AI, partic-
ularly in reﬂecting on what the context of ethical decision-making should be.
Can we use intelligence to assess the goals that intelligence pursues? To deﬁne
intelligence in terms of goals may already be implicitly to have in mind a certain kind
of goal. I am not entirely clear if achieving the goal of patting one’s head with one
hand while rubbing one’s stomach with the other hand is best characterised as
demonstrating intelligence; perhaps it does even though it does not serve well as a
typical example. Do we use intelligence in any way to assess what goals we wish to
achieve? Russell and Norvig note that Aristotle’s work on reasoning and logic paved
the way for the algorithms that are now used in developing AI and cite the
Nicomachean Ethics, Book III, Chap. 3, 1112b. In this passage, Aristotle writes,
‘We deliberate not about ends but about means. For a doctor does not deliberate
whether he shall heal, nor an orator whether he shall persuade, nor a statesman
whether he shall produce law and order, nor does any one else deliberate about his
end’ [6]. This is often taken by those working in AI to mean that we can ﬁt in any
ends that we desire.

188
5
Humans and Intelligent Machines: Underlying Values
However, such a claim cannot plausibly be attributed to Aristotle. His claims on
this point are subtle; there is some confusion and dispute in the interpretation of his
texts on deliberation, which can appear inconsistent, but one thing is clear: Aristotle
did not think we could fashion ends out of the thin cloth of our desires alone. This
dispute cuts to central debates, chasms perhaps, within philosophy. For Aristotle, our
ends are moulded for us by nature. We use our judgement to appreciate them and to
reﬂect on what it would be like to achieve them, for we need to have some idea of
their nature in order to be able to aim towards them. The man of wisdom (sorry to
break the news, but Aristotle was not known for talking about ‘women’ and
‘wisdom’ in the same breath) or ‘phronesis’ developed the ability to discern in
each situation what good ends were possible to attain. However, such a view requires
a teleological view of nature where value is inherent in the world in some way and is
directly at odds with the cluster of views that hold that humans simply set their own
ends. Importantly for us, the good for man arises from our nature.
These issues will be discussed further in Chap. 6 and will form the backdrop to
many questions in AI ethics.
Forms and components of intelligence: abduction, attention, and relevance We
have raised the question of the difference between human and machine intelligence
and whether the general way in which we approach these, as essentially the same, or
as potentially somewhat different. Might we confuse or bias the issues by modelling
machine intelligence on human intelligence, or vice versa?
There is a great deal that is still unknown about intelligence in both machines and
humans. The potential capacities of AI are subject to intense debate and disagree-
ment. Here, we cannot answer the question of whether human intelligence can be
reproduced completely in machines, although there are those who assume that this
will happen and is only a matter of adding capacity. Since much recent progress in
AI has been attributable to the signiﬁcant increases in processing power and in very
large increases in the availability of data, there are those who believe that pushing on
this path of big data plus processing power will be all we need. Others consider that it
is either unlikely or that it is in principle impossible. A question of more speciﬁc
interest to us is whether machine intelligence, as it is now or as it might be, could
capture the kind of human intelligence and thought needed for moral decisions.
There are many who have argued, on a variety of bases, that artiﬁcial intelligence
manifested in machines will always fall short of human intelligence. There are many
aspects to this contentious debate, including the issue of whether full intelligence
would require consciousness, whether consciousness in a machine is even possible,
and if it were, what it would take for a machine to manifest it [1, Ch 26, p. 1022 ff., 8,
Ch 6, pp. 106 ff.]. These issues are very complex both technically and philosoph-
ically, and it is not possible to cover them fully here. In illustration of how such
views may impact questions of ethics in AI, let us consider a recent book, The Myth
of Artiﬁcial Intelligence, by Erik Larson, since Larson’s claims raise issues that go to
the heart of some of the central questions in ethics, such as the nature of moral
reasoning and moral knowledge [9]. There are no prizes for guessing the gist of this
book, but if there were such a prize, it could serve as an example of one of his main

claims: that intelligence requires being able to make sensible guesses, using conjec-
ture to form reasonable hypotheses which have a good chance of explaining the
pattern of evidence before us.
5.2
The Nature and Value of Intelligence
189
Larson draws upon Charles Pearce’s conception of abduction. Pearce claimed
that to account for reason, we need to add abduction to deduction and induction, two
already well-established and complementary patterns of reasoning. Deductive rea-
soning is concerned with what can safely and validly be concluded from a set of
known premises. Deduction does not give us new knowledge and cannot tell us if its
premises are true. What it can tell us is that if the premises are true and an argument is
formally valid, then the conclusion must be true. Deduction deals in certainties.
Inductive reasoning sets out to extrapolate from past experience to the future.
Induction can supply us with new knowledge and may allow us to have conﬁdence
in certain claims, although we can never know its claims with the degree of certainty
that deduction permits. The weather forecast may be wrong. In Australia, swans are
black.
Pearce argued that there was something very basic missing from any account of
knowledge based simply on deduction and induction. On their own, these two forms
of reasoning cannot tell what framework to use to interpret experience. Deduction on
its own tells us nothing about the world. It needs induction to verify its premises.
Induction looks for regularities and patterns in experience, but which ones are going
to be of interest? In a set of strange circumstances, how do we know where to begin
to look for the most likely explanation? One answer is by amassing a considerable
range of general knowledge that would help us to make sense of the data and give us
a clue of where to look. However, attempts to date to force-feed general knowledge
into computers have had little impact on producing machines with the kind of
common sense that seems to come naturally to the dullest human. We need ‘common
sense’ and may rely on hunches or reasonable guesses to suggest the patterns behind
surprising results. The astute detective will pay heed to details that together form a
pattern that unlocks the puzzle and has an eye for what details are relevant. Sherlock
Holmes’ powers of deduction were in fact far more than mere deduction and would
have been nothing were it not for his powers of observation, which critically
included not simply amassing a ton of data but spotting patterns that made sense
of the data. Abduction is a reaction to surprise, as Pearce explained it, spotting an
explanation of why something we do not expect has happened. The explanation ﬁnds
something which, if true, would make the surprising fact unsurprising.
Larson argues that instances hailed as success for AI actually involve input from
the humans designing the system based on their abductive inferences. The famous
work by the Bletchley team, who cracked the Enigma code, involved a process of
elimination of many codes as impossible because they involved contradictions,
thereby speeding up the task of decrypting Enigma messages, making it easier for
the team to work out the answer. The arrogance of the Nazis in assuming that their
code was uncrackable also helped [9, pp. 10–12]. He also notes that the DeepMind
team working on AlphaGo programmed into it prior knowledge of the game,
inferences supplied from outside the inductive framework.

Humans and Intelligent Machines: Underlying Values
This points to a controversy about the methods and value of approaches that rely
on big data. Hence, yet again, we raise areas where progress in AI, the possibilities of
technology, and ethics come together—work which needs to be done and on which
there will be differing opinions.
Methodology in the Social Sciences
Debates in artiﬁcial intelligence about the nature of intelligence and the use of
methods such as machine learning and the use of big data to understand the
world, and in particular to understand human beings, have some parallels with
debates on methodology in the social sciences. There have been intensive
discussion and work on concerning the strengths and weaknesses of quantita-
tive and qualitative approaches to investigating the social world and to under-
standing individual human beings and social interactions [10]. Since many of
the ethical questions in AI concern its use to understand human beings, this is
worth noting.
Quantitative approaches look to what is measurable and observable, seek-
ing measurements which are reliable, replicable, and capable of being
expressed in mathematical terms [11]. This may be especially useful for policy
use and for applications such as measuring the outcomes of interventions.
However, can such approaches capture everything about the reality of
human life?
Qualitative methods such as ethnography and interviewing techniques seek
to study the meaning of the social world for those involved in it and to
understand the subjective point of view of individuals. A considerable body
of work developing such methodologies and examining their epistemological
foundations has built up [12]. Qualitative techniques involve person to person
interactions of various sorts. Efforts are made to account for subjective bias
and point of view, but the human point of view is nonetheless an essential
aspect of these methodologies. Even these make no claim to know ‘every-
thing’ and usually note the limitations of any particular study.
Quantitative and qualitative approaches are complementary and can give us
different sorts of information. However, there are social scientists who hold
varying views about the suitability of each approach for addressing particular
questions, and on the rigour of the very many different methodologies both
quantitative and qualitative, and on what manner of knowledge different
methods can produce.
Exercise 3
Could an approach based purely on machine learning ever replace qualitative
methods in social sciences?
Is there something special about human beings that cannot be fully understood by
a machine? Hint: this question is again deliberately vague and open ended.

5.2
The Nature and Value of Intelligence
191
This relates strongly to questions of moral epistemology and of the role of the
second-person stance, which we discuss further in Chap. 7.
This means that acquiring knowledge will rely at some point upon the capacity to
pay attention to what is relevant. This will be a key aspect of intelligence. This has
strong relevance for questions in ethics. We will discuss these further in considering
moral epistemology in Chap. 8. It will have implications for whether ethics can be
fully formalised within a machine; naturally, it raises the technical question of
whether such attention to what is relevant is even possible in a machine, which is
beyond the scope of this book; attention to issues of moral relevance is hard enough
in human beings, as we discuss further later. Recall also the discussions in Chap. 4
about methodology in ethics concerning how examples and cases are described.
There is no magic formula for picking out how a complex scenario that raises ethical
questions should be described, but how it is described will critically shape responses
to it.
5.2.2
Measuring Intelligence
Many accounts of intelligence, if not most, are inherently or implicitly comparative,
meaning that it follows from the characterisation of intelligence that it lends itself to
degrees of more or less (and, implicitly, better or worse). It hardly needs stating that
the implication is that more intelligence is better. However, it does not imply that
there will necessarily be one way of measuring intelligence. If we think of intelli-
gence in terms of goals, this will be especially difﬁcult, especially in complex
environments and with complex goals, where it may be hard to determine which
of the two means of achieving whatever goal in question is better. If we conceptu-
alise intelligence in other ways, it may be even harder to measure.
In valuing AI for assisting us with tasks requiring intelligence, it is salutary to
consider the often-troubling history of the measurement of intelligence. The capacity
of reason has been thought in the past to be something possessed by all, with notable
exceptions and with the common view that many were deﬁcient in reasoning.
Descartes opened his Discourse on the Method with the observation that common
sense is so equitably distributed that not even the most discontented among us wish
they had more of it [13], although ever since ﬁrst reading that decades ago, I have
never been sure if he was being sarcastic. However, the idea that reason, or
intelligence, is a matter of degree gained more ascendency with the acceptance of
Darwin’s idea of evolution, the notion that the difference between us and the higher
animals was a matter of degree and that our intelligence has its evolutionary origins
in beginnings, which we can see in other animals.
Standardised intelligence testing was introduced in the early twentieth century by
Alfred Binet for purposes such as determining which children should be sent to
special education classes and for assigning army recruits to particular tasks
according to their abilities at the start of the ﬁrst world war [14]. Testing was

designed to attempt to be uniform and replicable and, above all, to categorise
individuals. Alongside the rise in the use of IQ tests were debates about the relative
role of environment and heritability in forming an individual’s level of intelligence,
as well as debates about whether intelligence was ﬁxed across the course of an
individual’s lifetime. It was the existence of standardised tests themselves that
helped form the shape of these debates, which forms an enduring theme of how
measurement helps to shape how we perceive and judge the world. Perhaps many of
the assumptions that we make about intelligence have arisen in response to the
widespread use of standardised testing of human beings and comparison of different
individuals as ‘having’ different levels of intelligence.
192

Humans and Intelligent Machines: Underlying Values
5.2.3
Intelligence and the Value of the Individuals
The judgement of individuals and, indeed, of whole population groups, on the basis
of intelligence levels, has a very sorry history. The careless labelling of some groups
as of lesser intelligence than others, often ignoring factors such as cultural bias in
tests, educational opportunities, and environmental inﬂuences, has fed into and
bolstered racism, sexism, and judgemental attitudes towards the working class
[14]. The lower social, political, and moral status given to women at some times
and in some places has often been justiﬁed on the presumption of women’s lesser
intellectual capabilities [15], and claims for the lower intellectual capacities of some
population groups have also been used in attempts to justify slavery and colonialism.
Eugenics movements aimed at certain groups, including the working class and those
deemed of feeble intellect, likewise have a shameful history. The assumption behind
such views has been that higher intelligence equates to higher value as a human
being.
The heightened value given to intelligence as a human quality exacerbates such
judgements, as well as feeding the testing and examination of IQ in the ﬁrst place; it
would be an interesting thought experiment to consider how such debates might
have played out with intense interest, calibrating the ability to produce neat hand-
writing, sporting prowess, the ability to ‘get’ jokes, the capacity to relax after a tense
day at work, the knack of making party guests feel at ease, and so on, and comparing
individuals and population groups by such measures. The demands of working life,
especially post-industrial revolution and perhaps especially in the information era,
may emphasise not only the productivity but also the intellectual capacity of
individual humans as a marker of their value to industry. Again, are we ﬁtting
technology to humans, or humans to technology?
In assessing the use of artiﬁcial intelligence, it is well to be mindful of the
potential for the judgement that higher levels of intelligence are better than lower
levels, to lead to scornful attitudes towards individuals and to groups of human
beings, whether intentional or unintentional, conscious or not. Such attitudes are
perhaps most readily seen in discussions of human enhancement and of technolog-
ical unemployment and its social consequences. What we need is a way of

celebrating the intellect and intellectual achievements alongside a robust way of
valuing the human being per se. Or should we value human beings per se? Since the
concept of a human being refers to a particular biological species, this has often been
thought to have no moral signiﬁcance in itself. The idea of being a person is often
used in preference. Personhood requires certain capacities, including cognitive
capacities, and on some accounts, it may be linked implicitly to the intellect. The
notion of personhood is examined further in Chap. 9.
5.2
The Nature and Value of Intelligence
193
Exercise 4
Can the value of human beings be separated from the value of any of their
attributes? Note: this is another deliberately difﬁcult question.
5.2.4
A Quick Note on Intelligence and Speed
There is a link between speed and the measurement of intelligence. IQ tests have a
time limit, and the more questions one correctly completes in a certain time, the
higher one’s score. There may be individuals who would have come up with a novel
and inventive solution to a problem if given enough time, but they are destined to be
given low IQ scores unless they play the testing game correctly. Much of the
‘intelligence’ of artiﬁcial intelligence is attributable to brute processing speed.
Quiz games and other such tests of wit almost always include speed as an element.
Note that a way of describing someone with low intellectual skills is simply to
describe them as ‘slow’.
Exercise 5
Why do we value speed in intellectual comprehension per se? And do we value it on
all occasions? Illustrate this with examples.
This is an important question for any comparison of human and artiﬁcial intelli-
gence, since the pure speed and processing power of AI is a major reason why it is
used in many instances. Including measurements of the speed at which an individual
is able to solve a problem or perform a task involving intelligence is a measure of
productivity that may have a place in a competitive economy but elsewhere and for
certain complex tasks may be overused. Pablo Picasso produced approximately
50,000 artworks during his lifetime, whereas Vermeer, perhaps most famous for
his ‘Girl with a Pearl Earring’, produced only 36 known paintings. Much as one
might wish for him to have left 50,000 paintings for us, the speed of his production
seems entirely irrelevant to valuing his artistic merit. Or is it? One might argue that
his meticulous slowness in painting forms part of what is admired about his work.
Consider someone who had spent twice as long as another person to acquire a certain
skill, be it with calculus or with making perfect dovetail joints, but who ended up
with equal ability.

194
5
Humans and Intelligent Machines: Underlying Values
Exercise 6
Must we include speed in accounts of intelligence? Is speed alone a value? If
so, why? Could this be connected with an account of intelligence that links it to
the achievement of external goals?
If we could achieve immortality or greatly increased life expectancy, would we
still value speed as a factor in intelligence in the same way?
Is speed a factor in wisdom? Or in coming to ethical judgements?
5.2.5
Intelligence and Society
One feature of human intelligence is that we can often outsource it to others. In fact,
this is a central feature of how humans make use of intelligence—the capacity to
learn, including the capacity to learn from others, and the willingness to use others as
authoritative sources. You will recall that the deﬁnition of intelligence given by Legg
and Hutter above in Sect. 5.2.1 referred to the intelligence of ‘an agent’ [3]. Human
intelligence is shared across cultures and between individuals, as well as recorded
and outsourced in artefacts as simple as papyrus and the abacus. The essential fact
that we collaborate in building intelligence means that any account of human nature
that stresses only intelligence or reason, and not our social nature, may struggle to
give a full account of intelligence.
Hence, for this small section with the impossibly bold title, ‘intelligence and
society’, I am outsourcing to you, the reader. The topic is too vast for any other
sensible strategy. Let us consider as an exercise a much-cited claim about AI,
intelligence, and society, which we met earlier in Chap. 3. An Open Letter on the
website of the Future of Life Institute, signed by over 8000 people, including many
prominent signatories in the area of AI research, writes:
The potential beneﬁts are huge; everything that civilisation has to offer is a product of human
intelligence; we cannot predict what we might achieve when this intelligence is magniﬁed by
the tools AI may provide, but the eradication of disease and poverty are not unfathomable.
[16]
Variations of such a claim have been frequently restated, for example, in a video
by DeepMind, ‘Welcome to DeepMind: Embarking on one of the greatest adven-
tures in scientiﬁc history’ [17], which starts off with a panoramic stretch of the river
Thames with views of central London and the voice-over explaining that human
intelligence has formed all of modern civilisation in a variety of ways [16]. The view
encompasses the revered St Paul’s Cathedral, designed by Sir Christopher Wren and
built in 1675, the iconic skyscraper The Shard built in 2009, and the much ridiculed
skyscraper, 20 Fenchurch Street, known locally as the Walkie Talkie [18], com-
pleted in 2014 and famous for having melted a Jaguar car with light reﬂected from its
curved windows, an unfortunate event producing both annoyance and amusement
and which presumably was not a conscious goal of the ‘intelligence’ behind
civilisation [19].

5.2
The Nature and Value of Intelligence
195
This general claim regarding the role of intelligence in forming civilisation makes
a number of assumptions, not least of which is that AI is set to ‘magnify’ human
intelligence. In critique of any views, it is often useful to tease out even the most
obvious assumptions, because claims that are broadly true are often overstated or
lack the necessary nuance or context. Before reading on, look carefully at the quote
and note any assumptions it makes.
It is implied that it may be possible to eradicate (an extremely strong claim) war,
disease, and poverty by increases in intelligence. If this is possible, it suggests that
either nothing but a shortage of intelligence has prevented us from solving these
issues already or that intelligence is sufﬁcient to produce or encourage the extra
factors involved in ﬁnding a complete (because remember ‘eradicate’) solution.
However, in fairness, it’s easy for anyone to make somewhat overblown claims.
It also states that ‘everything’ (note, a very strong claim) that civilisation has to
offer is a ‘product’ of human intelligence. This implies that intelligence is involved
in producing everything we value in civilisation but does not commit itself to any
particular view on the precise role that intelligence plays in each factor. Note too that
when we use the term ‘intelligence’ in such a way, we often assume that we are
talking about a high level of intelligence, but perhaps we could understand the claim
as referring to the application of intelligence, even in simple or mundane ways.
Exercise 7
Consider the strongest case that could be made to support this claim, and then
consider the case against it. It is a good strategy to do examine both sides of an
argument for many reasons, including that the better you have stated and understood
a position, the better prepared you are to ﬁnd a strong and precisely aimed case
supporting it, and likewise, for making a case against it. Note any ways in which
your answer is affected by personal experience.
Is there anything valuable in civilisation that owes little or nothing to
intelligence?
Does the kind of intelligence that AI is producing so far is the kind of intelligence
that we need to help solve the three problems mentioned—war, disease, poverty?
Is the reason these have not been solved a want of ‘intelligence’?
Could we appreciate the valuable things of civilisation without intelligence?
The quote speaks simply of AI, but AI is always developed by particular people
and particular groups. How might this impact upon the possibilities that the magni-
ﬁcation of intelligence by the tools of AI will serve to address these speciﬁc societal
problems?
These questions are broad and vague but can alert us to the frames of mind with
which many questions in AI ethics are approached.

Humans and Intelligent Machines: Underlying Values
5.2.6
Augmenting Human Intelligence with AI
The pursuit of human enhancement, which we discuss in more detail in Chap. 11,
generally assumes that this will involve enhancing our intelligence. People visiting
nail bars, having hair extensions, and working out at the gym are also engaged in
some kind of human enhancement. If we are to use AI to enhance our intelligence in
some way, perhaps using something such as the Neuralink implant, we need some
account of what speciﬁcally AI can do, which will ﬁll in gaps or address weaknesses
in human intelligence [20]. Sometimes this is envisaged simply as speed and
processing power.
We need to address the question of whether there is some general notion of
intelligence shared between machines and humans, such that you can simply have
‘more’ of it, or whether there are complementary and different capacities. We also
need to ask whether in regard to intelligence and the capacities that it relies upon,
there are no upper bounds or whether there might even be something to be gained by
having certain limits placed upon certain capacities.
In illustration, take, for example, the discussion by Neil Lawrence of what he calls
embodiment factors in comparing human (mind) and machine intelligence [21]. No
intelligence is ever going to be ‘complete’, since this would require total knowledge
of the universe to date and ﬂawless capacity to compute outcomes. (Unless, of
course, there is a God who has such an intelligence.) Rather, predictions are needed,
based upon available data and models of the environment to compute using that data.
Communication is a ‘side effect’ of intelligence since it is a way of acquiring new
data and models.
When we compare current computers with humans, computers can communicate
information far faster than we can. We are limited by the processing speed and
capacity of our brains and limited in how we can communicate with each other by
the limits of our bodies and our sensory experience. However, the computing power
of the human brain is vast compared to how fast we can speak, write, or otherwise
communicate. Lawrence calls this the embodiment factor: the compute power
divided by the communication bandwidth. Humans can only communicate a tiny
fraction of what they can compute.
It is easy to test this for yourself. Start describing in words precisely what you can
see or hear or touch or smell, right now; or to make it even worse, in the last hour; or
to make it even worse, every single one of your memories since you were 5. Even if
you’ve forgotten a lot, you’ll never do anything else if you try to complete this task.
In contrast, computers can send data at incredibly faster speeds.
Does this simply mean that humans are ‘bad’ at communication compared to
computers? That we are just primitive badly wrought computers, struggling with the
best our porridge-like brains can muster, and gasping for an upgrade? That would be
to ignore what is special about us. Rather, our limits help to shape distinctly human
ways of interacting. It means, for example, that each one of us has a large, private
domain of information about ourselves and our worlds, available only to us, yet we
can imaginatively share this with others, and by empathy extrapolate to what others

may be feeling, often without the use of words or formal communication. Lawrence
quotes in illustration Ernest Hemingway’s six-word novel: ‘Baby shoes for sale,
never worn’. The form of our intelligence is thus very different from the intelligence
of machines, Lawrence argues.
5.3
Values Underlying the Use of Data
197
Forms of Knowledge, Intelligence, and Poetry
While we are on the subject, an interesting aside. Debates and contrasting
positions regarding intelligence and the source of knowledge are as old as
philosophy itself. We have already met Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill,
two utilitarian philosophers but with very different approaches to such ques-
tions. Bentham’s approach stressed analysis of issues and measurement. As we
saw in Sect. 2.5.2, his feliciﬁc calculus attempted to capture and calculate
pleasure and pain [22], but he was notorious for his lack of capacity to
understand other people. In his Essay on Bentham, although lavishing consid-
erable praise on Bentham, who was his godfather, Mill lamented that he had
‘failed in deriving light from other minds’ [23].
John Stuart Mill, although also a utilitarian and favouring empiricism, was
greatly inﬂuenced by the Romantics, in particular by poetry [24]. He consid-
ered that poetry was a means of gaining direct knowledge of the mind of
another person. By poetry, he did not mean necessarily the literary works of an
accomplished poet, but any form of communication between individuals that
enabled such insights.
Perhaps poetry captures a form of intelligence beyond the grasp of any
computers we have now, or may ever have. Understanding other people is an
elementary but often neglected aspect of ethics. Many ethical dilemmas would
never even arise, if we only took the trouble to understand each other better.
5.3
Values Underlying the Use of Data
Summary
The value we attach to intelligence is closely related to the value attached to truth, to
knowledge, and to how we understand and value data. Much AI uses large amounts
of data; hence, examining the values underlying the use of data will be a useful
background for questions in AI ethics, such as questions concerning privacy. We
examine the link between placing a high value on knowledge and the sharing of that
knowledge.
The values attached to intelligence are closely related to values regarding knowl-
edge, for intelligence involves learning and the capacity to learn and both generates
and depends upon knowledge. In the ﬁeld of AI, much recent progress has been
enabled by access to massive amounts of data, so the value given to machine
intelligence both builds upon the values given to data and helps to cement its
value. (Of course, in practice, much data can be worthless: poorly categorised,

false, incomplete.) We will touch on some more relevant points later in the section
discussing epistemology and its importance for ethics. For now, an exercise,
followed by some literature.

Humans and Intelligent Machines: Underlying Values
5.3.1
One View of the Value of Big Data
Here is one view about the value of data, taken from Victor Mayer-Schönberger and
Kenneth Cukier’s book Big Data: A Revolution that Will Transform How We Live,
Work, and Think [25]. This is one view only, but it represents a certain style of
approach in the ﬁeld. Certain claims made in the book are outlined here.
Exercise 8
1. In the age of big data, even the most trivial pieces of information will be deemed
valuable [25, p. 100].
Question: For whom is such data valuable?
2. Information is a nonrivalrous good, and one person’s use of it does not detract
from its use by others [25, p. 101].
Question: Is this true for all information? Even if true, what else matters? If
information can be used by another, does this even detract from its value?
3. The value of data is in its use [25, p. 104].
Question: Is this true? Does this mean that the value of data is simply
instrumental?
4. For pragmatic and cost reasons, it is prudent to gather as much data as possible
and to use it for as many different uses as possible [25, p. 109].
Question: To whom does this ‘make sense’? Note how the use of such a
phrase can lead one to certain conclusions. Does anything else matter besides
‘making sense’?
5. Data-driven decisions will enhance, or supersede, human decision-making [25,
p. 141].
Question: When might this be a good thing? When not so good?
6. Amazon allegedly switched to algorithmic recommendations instead of book
reviews as a better way of increasing sales [25, p. 141].
Question: In whose interest is this? Compare the different forms of informa-
tion or knowledge contained in a human-composed book review and an algorith-
mic recommendation.
In considering the multiple uses of data and information and questions of value
arising from this, recall our earlier discussion of technological developments in the
spread of information, including the work of Walter Benjamin, in Sect. 3.6.2.
Data, prediction, and freedom The question of free will has perplexed philoso-
phers, theologians, and more ordinary mortals for millennia. We are unlikely to
‘solve’ the question to the satisfaction of all here. Nonetheless, there are critical
questions about how we view ourselves, how we view others, how we treat each

other, and many ethical questions, including questions of control, power, and
manipulation that arise.
5.3
Values Underlying the Use of Data
199
Exercise 9
Note Amazon’s claim that data drove more sales than book reviews. Does this imply
anything about the ‘real’ source of human motivation? Are we creatures who are
caused to purchase items by the hidden algorithms of Amazon, or are we creatures
who choose what books to purchase based upon our preferences, interests, and
values?
Does the capacity to predict human behaviour from data have implications for our
conception of ourselves as free agents?
5.3.2
Truth and Communication
A common driving force behind much enthusiasm for AI is the idea that the more
intelligence we have, the better. Likewise, it is often assumed that the more knowl-
edge we have, the better, and it is often assumed that if knowledge is held as a value,
then it follows from this that knowledge should spread and hence be communicated.
Is this true? It is crucial to note that knowledge implies a knower.
Valuing the communication of information is one motivating force behind open-
access initiatives. It has a great appeal, but it comes directly into conﬂict with values
of privacy and conﬁdentiality. This clash arises from the meaning of information
when considered from different perspectives. Information is abstract and can be
conceptualised in a timeless way and stored anywhere, but communication takes
place at a speciﬁc time and place. Information which is merely a point on a massive
dataset to some people is information with personal, perhaps life-altering signiﬁ-
cance to others. Is the abstract idea of sharing information, of communicating truth,
something to be valued in and of itself? Or do we only ever value information and
truth in relation to some pragmatic use it has for us? This question is worth
pondering, both for attempts to resolve practical questions in AI ethics and for the
question of how we conceptualise information and knowledge. As with so many of
the questions in this book, this is a pointer to complex debates in philosophy and
elsewhere. Let us look at an example of the presentation of two different viewpoints
on ‘truth for truth’s sake’.
To the Lighthouse
Virginia Woolf’s 1927 novel concerns the Ramsey family, visiting the Isle of
Skye in Scotland [26]. The boy James is very keen to row out to the lighthouse
the following day, but a trip can only take place if safe to do so, and it is very
likely that a storm is on its way. His mother, Mrs. Ramsey, tells James that of
course they can go, if the weather is ﬁne, and the boy is ﬁlled with joy. His
(continued)

father, Mr. Ramsey, and some other men present, insist that the weather will be
too bad and that there is no possibility whatsoever that they could go to the
Lighthouse. Mrs. Ramsey is concerned to hold out some hope in the child’s
mind, suggesting that the wind may well change. The novel presents two
extremely different viewpoints: one of factual accuracy, which decries what it
sees as irrationality, and a second which focuses on consideration for the
child’s feelings [26, p. 9].
200
5
Humans and Intelligent Machines: Underlying Values
Mr. Ramsey is a professional philosopher, perhaps no coincidence. Mr. and
Mrs. Ramsey personify two opposing attitudes to the truth but crucially also to
communication.
Exercise 10 Try to articulate the best possible justiﬁcation for the positions
of each of Mr. and Mrs. Ramsey.
Mrs. Ramsey is portrayed by Woolf as considering that Mr. Ramsey’s
insistence on the truth is wantonly disregarding the ways in which civilisation
is held together.
How does such a view contrast with the view that ‘everything that civili-
sation has to offer is a product of human intelligence’?
How could it be possible that there are two such opposing views?
5.4
Human Nature
Summary
An understanding of human nature underlies many ethical questions, especially in
AI ethics, where we frequently need to compare and contrast humans with intelligent
machines. Understanding some of the central issues and points of variance in
accounts of human nature can also facilitate our understanding of the viewpoints
of others. We examine different views on the place of humans within the wider
universe, including its trajectory over time; claims about the status of humans within
the natural world; questions about the relationship between human beings and our
embodiment; the issue of whether there is an essence to human nature, and if so,
what this is; the uniqueness of humans, or otherwise; divisions within the self and the
‘higher self’; the boundaries and limits of human nature; the perfectibility or
otherwise of human beings; the social nature of humans; and the signiﬁcance of
myth and origin stories of human beings. These issues are illustrated in relation to
questions in AI ethics.

Human Nature

5.4.1
Introduction
We have seen the importance of asking the question of whether human intelligence
and machine intelligence will necessarily differ in any signiﬁcant respects. We have
also noted the difﬁculty of providing a precise account of what intelligence is and
have considered the different ways in which it might be valued. Intelligence is often
seen as a key hallmark of humanity—we are the ‘rational animal’. Here, yet again,
there are many different perspectives on what signiﬁcance our intellect has for
understanding human nature and the value attached to humans. Nonetheless, some
account of the value of human beings is going to be essential for addressing many of
the questions of AI ethics.
The topic of human nature is vast, but we will navigate this by examining some
key issues, each highly pertinent to understanding our relationships with intelligent
machines and hence to how we might understand and address questions of value.
Further reading will be given, but even this will be only a small selection. This
section is organised around a series of questions that elicit different approaches to
human nature. Different viewpoints on human nature may point to different stances
in metaphysics, politics, and, often, signiﬁcantly, religions or the absence thereof.
So, understanding something of the range of views on human nature is especially
crucial given the meeting of different world views in our global world, and the
changing attitudes towards religion especially in those parts of the world where AI
has so far been most developed. Many of the issues raised around human nature are
also pertinent to questions in the philosophy of mind, and we will give an overview
of some debates in the philosophy of mind in Chap. 8, especially insofar as they are
directly relevant to current debates in AI and AI ethics. Elucidating them will often
help to unearth the root source of attitudes towards AI.
Views on human nature are generally complex, nuanced, and often deeply
integrated into culture and religion. Hence this section involves a considerable
amount of simpliﬁcation, especially in characterising and contrasting divergent
views. The simpliﬁcation is intended as a heuristic device to enable clarity that can
assist in spotting broad tendencies but is an invitation to further exploration, not a
place to stop!
5.4.2
Our Place in the Universe
No account of human nature would be complete without considering humans in
context: in the larger universe. This is partly for the mundane reason that all entities
are part of a wider whole and, more speciﬁcally, because all biological species have a
place within an ecosystem and arise within the temporal context of evolution. In
addition, human beings are self-aware and can reﬂect not just upon themselves but
on the world around them, the past, and the future. For us, the question of our place
in the universe is replete with meaning. It is not simply like a biologist asking about

how wasps evolved and what role they play in the ecosystem. It is more like the
wasps themselves wondering why they are so stripey, why they sting, why they can’t
make honey like the bees can, why humans don’t like them, whether they can
improve their behaviour, what that awful buzzing sound is all the time, and whether
there is anything more to life than all this. We outline some thumbnail sketches of
contrasting positions.

Humans and Intelligent Machines: Underlying Values
Not special at all On one, human beings have no special position or status in the
universe. We are the chance product of a materialist universe, existing for a tiny slice
of time on a rocky planet in an obscure part of an unimaginably vast and unimag-
inably old universe, and that’s it. It may be rather peculiar that this little bit of the
universe can somehow stand up and blink at the rest of the universe, and we may as
well make the most of it while we’re here, but there is no wider signiﬁcance than
that. On some version of such an account, we are a complete anomaly, possibly all
alone staring out into the blackness of space, which does not answer back; on other
accounts, there are countless other intelligent and conscious beings on other planets,
and that makes us even less remarkable. We will die, and the universe will continue
for billions of years, until it too vanishes.
Top of the tree On other accounts, we are indeed extremely special. Perhaps the
most special thing about the whole show. Evolutionary accounts can at once lead to
the view that we are ‘nothing but’ a complex collection of molecules assembled out
of the material world by the operation of the laws of nature and also to the view that
evolution has been ‘leading up’ to human beings as the current pinnacle of the
universe. The development of consciousness, of self-awareness, and of intelligence,
which, so far as we know, is best exempliﬁed in us humans, may be thought to be
what the universe is all about.
Note the importance of time: some accounts of the place of human beings in the
universe essentially describe the passage of time. We may be a ﬂeeting presence, or a
part of a narrative unfolding, an account of the developing universe in which we play
a certain role. Some such views are generally implicitly teleological, imbuing a
purpose to the universe.
Humans as prototype On narrative views of the passage of time, we may be some
kind of passing phase. We may be ‘top of the tree’ right now but are due for a fall.
Max Tegmark outlines a view of the universe as developing to produce intelligence
in his book Life 3.0, which we discuss further in Chap. 11. Tegmark talks about the
cosmic awakening that occurred when intelligent and conscious life evolved [27,
p. 22]. On this view, humans have a special role in the present, but you may or may
not be sorry to hear that we are not the ultimate product of the universe.
Somewhere in the middle There are indeed many accounts of human nature that
place humans in some kind of middle position in the universe. These accounts align
very naturally with accounts of human nature that posit ‘higher’ and ‘lower’ aspects
of our makeup, which we discuss below. This common claim can be made in a
variety of ways and appears repeatedly, implicitly if not explicitly, in discussions of

AI, with hopes that AI will enhance or exceed our ‘higher’ natures and will remedy
the faults of our ‘lower’ natures.
5.4
Human Nature

‘A little lower than the angels’ Many such accounts place humans in some kind of
mid-position between God or the gods, or some higher realm, and the other animals,
‘a little lower than the angels’, as Psalm 8 puts it:
3 When I consider your heavens, the work of your ﬁngers,
the moon and the stars, which you have ordained,
4 what is man, that you think of him?
What is the son of man, that you care for him?
5 For you have made him a little lower than the angels,
and crowned him with glory and honor.
6 You make him ruler over the works of your hands.
You have put all things under his feet:
7 All sheep and cattle,
yes, and the animals of the ﬁeld,
8 the birds of the sky, the ﬁsh of the sea,
and whatever passes through the paths of the seas [28].
Note something about this psalm: the viewpoint of the author (it is attributed to
King David). He is self-consciously reﬂecting on the position of mankind within the
universe, given a stance of awe and wonders at the natural world. Very many
accounts bear some similarities to a view that places us somewhere between a higher
force, being, or notion and the animal or physical realm. We discussed in Chap. 4 the
question of the position from which one makes a moral judgement: near or far. The
way in which we approach this question of our place and role in the universe, the
position from which we approach it, may be very signiﬁcant. Contemplating the
heavens with a sense of wonder may be rather different from using them merely as a
source of knowledge, whether about the stars themselves or their use for navigation
and time-keeping.
Extrapolating
meaning
and
signiﬁcance
about
humanity’s
place
in the universe There are many different meanings that could be read onto claims
that humans have some special position in the universe. For example, many felt their
world views were shattered at Darwin’s claim that we evolved from animals,
interpreting this as meaning that we are ‘no more’ than animals, while others equally
look at evolution and conclude that we are the pinnacle of it, the ﬁnal cause of a
process lasting aeons in which countless species came and went, only to result in the
ultimate species: us. Others look at the facts of evolution and shrug: we are nothing
exceptional, or, despite evolution, there is another story to tell in which humans have
a special value, or a special role. The wonder expressed in Psalm 8 that we are ‘a
little lower than the angels’ is partly owing to the biblical view that, despite this,
humans have a particular and rather special role in the world. The centre of things
may be the boring average, the neglected middle child, the king or queen in their
court at the centre of a kingdom, or the hub that holds all together.

5.4.3
Claims About the Status of Humans Within
the Natural World
A particular slant on the place of humans in the universe is to pose the question from
the framework of ‘the natural world’. This highlights the question of positionality,
since on some accounts, we are simply part and parcel with nature, and on other
accounts, we stand, somehow, outside of it, yet at the same time, at least a part of us
must be within nature. Our ability to reason can, on the one hand, be explained as
having been produced by evolution and as operating in the substrate of our biology
and can be seen to be present to lesser degrees in our close cousins among the great
apes and other animals, yet this very ability to reason also seems to place us outside
of this purely biological, natural schema. We are not so much a naked ape, as a duck-
rabbit: within the natural order of things one way of looking at it, outside it from
another perspective.
This ‘outsider’ view may be based on one or more claims: our consciousness
enables us to view the universe, in the way that a rock cannot, and in which the lower
animals may only do to a lesser extent. There are complexities of course, noting the
superior senses of some animals and the mysterious nature of the consciousness of
organisms such as octopi and bats. Note, too, the primacy of our vision, as evidenced
in many metaphors of understanding. We ‘view’ the universe; we do not sniff it or
hear it. Our self-consciousness enables us to view ourselves viewing the universe
and also, as you are doing here right now, to view ourselves viewing ourselves
viewing the universe. (Stop now, that’s enough.)
Our knowledge and intellect enable us to understand the universe. Our agency
and (apparent) free will enables us to act purposefully within the universe. Our
wonder enables us to imaginatively reﬂect on the universe: consider how in Psalm
8 the psalmist starts by contemplating ‘the heavens, the works of thy ﬁngers’, and
one can imagine him, like billions of people surely have done throughout history,
lying back and gazing up at the stars, awestruck, and wondering about his place in
the cosmos.
Are we simply part of the natural world, or do we have a special place? If so, this
can place us under considerable responsibilities, for insofar as we are not simply
‘natural’ creatures, we may ﬁll this place wisely, or badly. There are many views
which hold we have a particular role, for example, of stewardship over the world,
and many accounts alleging that we have a pretty dismal score in this department,
from biblical accounts of multiple transgressions to modern ideas about our wrong-
doings in relation to technology and to the environment. Recall our discussion of
Heidegger’s notion of the Standing Reserve (Sect. 3.3.2) [29].
Consider the environmental movement. Within this, different positions regarding
the place of humans in nature are held: as simply part of nature; as having separated
ourselves from the natural world, responsible for its destruction, and hence a burden
on the planet; and as having separated ourselves from the natural world, but with a
strong role to play in redressing the damage we have caused and in safeguarding
species and habitats.

Exercise 11
Do you see any similar attitudes towards humans in relation to our development and
use of AI?
5.4.4
Humans and a Material Universe
Other aspects of these questions can be exposed by considering the signiﬁcance of
our place in the material world for ideas of human nature. The relevance to AI should
be immediately obvious. If we are entirely material beings, whatever that might
mean, perhaps everything about us can be captured, replicated, or even improved
upon by computers. Are we in essence mental beings somehow ‘joined’ to the
material world, ‘rational’ animals, or are we essentially embodied, animalistic
creatures, linked by evolution to forces we don’t fully understand? And if humans
are simply a part of the material world, are we just governed by material forces and
laws of nature, and if so, does this mean we do not have free will? The debates about
nature versus nurture do not address this question, since if our natures are formed by
nurture, they are still formed. We must also note that there are very many different
accounts of what human nature is like that draw upon scientiﬁc, archaeological, and
anthropological ﬁndings and on accounts of human evolution and that the disputes
about how to interpret such evidence are legion, such that we do not have space to
investigate these further here.
Humans, bodies, and brains Accounts of human nature which stress biology may
be reductive in the sense that they are intentionally juxtaposed against other views
such as the view that we possess immortal souls, claiming that humans are ‘nothing
but’ biological systems; we simply are ‘just’ apes. One variant of this, which is
(to my mind alarmingly) common, is the view that humans are reducible to just one
part of their biology: Jeff Hawkins and Sandra Blakeslee in On Intelligence tell their
readers that they are their brain [30]. There are plenty who share this view, even if
they might modify their position by a small amount if pressed to explain how come
they are worse at maths when it’s getting near dinner time, or by a large amount if
offered the chance to have their living brain placed in a life-sustaining vat.
Despite the blood–brain barrier, brains are highly integrated with the rest of the
body, and the complex communication process goes both ways. The brain is not ‘in’
the body as a brain may be in a vat: it’s a complexly integrated system. Descartes,
who considered that there are separate mental and material substances and that our
essence is mental, nonetheless realised the tight connections; he is not in his body in
the same way that a pilot is in a ship, he astutely observed [13]. The discovery that
many neurotransmitters are identical to hormones governing various processes in the
body underlines this, among other factors [31].
On the other hand, those who identify themselves with their brain also tend to
disassociate themselves from those parts of the brain that do not hold up to standards
of reason and of consciousness. The paradox of the view that ‘I am nothing but my

brain’ is that in order to conceptually separate the brain from the rest of the body,
let alone to pick and choose from one’s favourite parts of the brain, one must rely
upon some metaphysical or value-driven account of what it is to be a human being.
206

Humans and Intelligent Machines: Underlying Values
As with many other attitudes to human nature, these views are often held
implicitly and inconsistently rather than consciously. Their relevance to many ethical
issues in AI should be apparent. Moreover, an important question is raised: how
relevant is our particular and embodied biology to ethics? Our bodies both constrain
and enable us. Different features of our biological nature will shape how we see the
world and relate to each other; in other words, biology will impact moral epistemol-
ogy, a topic to be discussed in Chap. 8. Our biology is likely also to have had an
impact upon what ethical questions arise and how we seek to deal with them. The big
question will be what impact this might have on how we think about the use of AI
and on the ethical questions arising.
Ethics of Care
The ethics of care stresses relational aspects of our lives together and particular
virtues such as benevolence. Although work in the ethics of care may take a
general approach to ethics, feminist ethics of care in particular starts from the
situated position of considering human biology, especially reproduction, and
the implications this has for ethics. This includes looking at the realities of
human development from birth. In contrast, most other theories of ethics
assume a grown adult as the subject of ethical judgements, as if we sprang
up fully formed as in Botticelli’s painting ‘The Birth of Venus’. Those
working in this area include Carol Gilligan, Annette Baier, Virginia Held,
and Nell Noddings [32–35].
Humans are a sexed species, and biology uses functional descriptions,
which means that in describing the anatomy of males and of females, it is
necessary to refer to the anatomy of the opposite sex; otherwise, the function
and development of the reproductive organs would remain an incomplete
mystery. Moreover, a highly distinctive aspect of human reproduction is the
adjustments made for the large size of human brains compared to other apes,
plus the bipedal gait which has been pivotal for enabling us to manipulate the
world. This means that female hips have to be wide, but there is a limit: too
wide, and females would start to have difﬁculties in walking and running.
Thus, the newborn human infant is essentially still a fetus in comparison with
other similar species, born at an earlier stage of gestation and more dependent
for survival on its mother in particular and on adults in general.
From this, and many other factors, a range of things follow, including the
necessity for group support and for human societies to be highly nurturing of
infants and young children and of mothers. Many feminist philosophers have
argued that ethics needs to take more note of such factors and to include
consideration of the human need and capacity for care. Such a view is not
(continued)

limited to those describing themselves as feminist but stems from an approach
to ethics grounded in the speciﬁcity of our embodied and evolved lives. Such
an approach, if valid, could have numerous implications for some of the
questions of AI ethics.

Exercise 12
Roger Scruton is one of many philosophers to have noted the importance of
embodiment for how we experience the world of value and the relationships that
matter in ethics. In his book On Human Nature, he wrote that our most salient
experiences and emotions are tied to particularities of our embodiment, such as
familial and romantic love, our fear of death and of illness, and sympathy for others
as they face death and suffering [36, p. 115].
Is Scruton right to make such a claim? Why/why not? What elements of embodi-
ment would you put in such a list?
If embodiment is important to our moral world, are there any aspects of this that
are more salient than others?
Could such embodiment by advanced robots, or a sufﬁciently similar simulacrum
of it, recreate such a human moral universe, and if so, could such robots engage with
us as part and parcel of our moral community?
Would any aspects be absent, and if so, how much of an issue would that be?
Could the loss of certain of these embodiment factors be seen as a plus, viewed as
transcending our natures rather than as losing part of them? Consider, for example,
how fear of death and suffering, and attachment to others, might impose moral limits
on us. Could a world of nothing but AI be a moral improvement on our world?
Consider also the discussion of the object of morality in Chap. 4 and how these
issues of embodiment might impact on the way that the purpose of morality is
understood.
There may be some aspects of our embodiment that mould very central elements
of our moralities, such as our mortality. Injunctions against wanton killing of
community members are virtually universal. Consider the impact on moral systems
if we attained some kind of indeﬁnite life extension by some technological means.
This may be extremely hard to imagine or may lead to wild and imaginative
conjectures, since death is such an ingrained part of biological experience. Other
aspects of our biology may seem more contingent, such as human’s distinctive lack
of body hair (okay, okay, I know about naked mole rats), but even this has had a
large impact upon moral and social codes around the world. Robots are often given
human-like faces and may be given distinctively male or female ﬁgures but are less
often dressed in clothing. Moreover, many of these concern questions of purity,
taboo, deﬁlement, and cultural and class difference, which are starkly apparent to
many but which often perplex others who consider they confound explanation.
Could an AI, an advanced robot, truly understand these nuances?

Paro the seal, embodiment, and mimicry People living with dementia may retain
considerable awareness of their social world, of their appearance, and of the material
world around them, for example, through the tactile experiences of familiar clothing
and fabric [37]. There has been considerable attention to the use of robot pets such as
the seal Paro for providing comfort and calming people living with dementia,
especially in the more advanced stages where verbal communication may be limited
and where people may experience distress and agitation [38, 39]. Paro has sensors
and can react to people’s touch, learning from the past and behaving in a manner
similar to that of a living seal (without the poop). One reason for using a robot pet
rather than a real one is to avoid inadvertent harm to a live animal. The robot seals
are also furry, hence providing tactile comfort.
Exercise 13
Consider the ethical issues of using a Paro seal for a person living with advanced
dementia.
Now consider a robot designed to mimic the behaviour, skin texture and temper-
ature, facial features, etc., of a human companion, for example, designed to appear
like a small grandchild who is sitting on the lap of a person living with dementia. Are
there any different issues of concern here? Note any responses you have, even if you
ﬁnd it hard to articulate them.
Consider a voice assistant used for a person living with dementia, who has
difﬁculty remembering that their husband or wife has passed away, which sadly
happens quite commonly. Would it be ethical to use a voice assistant that mimics the
voice of the person’s deceased partner?
These questions highlight issues around the particularities of human embodiment
in general and the identities of individual human beings in particular.
Note that in answering such questions, there will very often be nuance with some
valuable elements in technology and other elements that may need adjustment,
further thought, or that outweigh the beneﬁcial aspects. Context also matters.
Do all humans have essentially the same nature? On some philosophical and
religious views, there are different types of humans, separated by categories such as
sex or social and economic class. Different valuations may or may not be attached to
those in different categories, including the assignment of different roles in life and
even expectations of moral behaviour and different penalties under the law. Many of
the most revered philosophers, including Plato and Aristotle, held such views. Recall
our discussion of universality in ethics in Chap. 4.
Foundation Myths in Plato’s Republic
In his work The Republic, the philosopher Plato (428/7–348/7 BCE) described
his ideal society, which, surprise, surprise, turns out to be one ruled by
philosopher kings [5]. Plato did consider that some women would also be
capable of acting as rulers, a view untypical for his time. He divided society
(continued)

into distinct classes. The Guardian class is divided into the rulers or Guardians
proper, and the auxiliaries, who perform a range of functions such as military,
police, and executive functions under the orders of the rulers. The rest of
society is in the agricultural and industrial class, performing the basic labour
and producing the goods and services which keep society functioning. This
social division may be tempered somewhat by the fact that the Guardians were
supposed to rule for the sake of society and not for personal gain, living austere
lives.
5.4
Human Nature
209
Plato famously advocated that the rulers should tell myths about the
foundations of society in order to reinforce social stability. This have often
been translated as the ‘noble lie’, but it was clear that Plato considered that all
classes would believe these myths. One myth concerned the origin of different
human beings. All in this land are brothers, but when fashioned by god,
different metals were put into the mix. The Guardians were mixed with gold,
the auxiliaries with silver, and the labouring classes with bronze. (Note that
this creation myth refers to ‘all in this land’, not all human beings everywhere.)
Children generally resemble their parents, but because all humans are
similar, sometimes things get muddled up, and gold parents give birth to a
bronze or silver child, or a silver parent to a gold, and so on (somewhat like
two muggle parents giving birth to a wizard child in the Harry Potter books).
The Guardians have to watch the mixture of metals in all children and ensure
that the children move to the appropriate class, an early version of state-
sanctioned interference in parental rights. If a Guardian has a child with bronze
in it, they must harden their hearts and degrade it to the industrial class.
Exercise 14
It is easy to imagine that Plato’s foundation myth of the three metals is the remnant of
an ancient view that has no relevance today. Indeed, reactions to Plato’s Republic
throughout the ages have been very diverse but include the view that it acts as a
blueprint for fascism.
Are similar views still held in one way or another? A key qualiﬁcation for
membership of the Guardian class was intellectual ability: they are philosophers,
spending much of the day in abstract contemplation, while also ruling others. Could
our use of AI be riding on, and reinforcing, a similar social stratiﬁcation, with more
power and status given to those seen to have greater intelligence?
Plato’s Guardians had the authority to rule, an authority supposedly accepted by
the populace as a whole. Compare and contrast this to those who have the power that
their use of AI and other computing technology brings them, such as the power to
shape social media and to design algorithms that impact our daily lives. Does the
split between the ruling class and the auxiliary class still apply in a technological,
AI-driven world?
Could a technological divide create further classes of people? Would this matter,
so long as all were in agreement, or believed some ‘noble lie’? Suppose the ‘noble

lie’ is that humans are made of messy wetware, and so, limited by our biology which
constrains processing speeds, our intelligence is less than that of the silicone and
metal-based lifeforms, which will rule over us?

Humans and Intelligent Machines: Underlying Values
5.4.5
Is There an Essence to Human Nature?
There have been many attempts to pinpoint a distinctive essence to human beings.
Candidates include freedom, our capacity for self-consciousness, our capacity for
cultural as opposed to individual learning, the human use of convention, and the use
of language to laugh and cry. Some discussions in this area point to distinctive
qualities that led to the evolution of attributes that separate us from our closest
relatives, such as the use of ﬁre to cook food, which rendered it easier to digest.
We have seen how Russell and Norvig postulated that humans termed themselves
Homo sapiens because intelligence is so important to us. However, since the term
Homo sapiens is used biologically to differentiate us from other species of hominids,
it also has the implications that it is our intelligence (or at least, our level of
intelligence) that distinguished us from the others, who now, alas, are no more,
but not merely in the sense that small distinctions between markings and habitat
might distinguish one species from another close species; intelligence distinguishes
us in that it plays a key explanatory role in an account of human life, both individual
and collective. (This is so far to say nothing about what else may be important to any
account of human distinctiveness.) After all, we could also have picked ourselves out
as, say, ‘the naked ape’, and although clothing is a fascinating cultural subject to
study, our lack of body hair is not really the most interesting thing about us.
Intelligence is important to us, and it is especially important to AI researchers
who have dedicated their working lives to developing machine intelligence. One can
also observe that philosophical accounts of human nature that stress reason or
intelligence as our key hallmark and best characteristic are produced by
philosophers—another very small subset of humanity who are, again, very wedded
to intellectual endeavours. This may have biased their views. There have been
different contenders for human traits with the power to illuminate our distinctive
natures. It is interesting to look at some of these, not so much for the purposes of
deciding which is the ‘right’ answer, but to consider different aspects of our natures
which may illuminate the question of the value of AI to us.
Homo Ludens is the title of a 1938 book by the Dutch historian and cultural
theorist Johan Huizinga [40]. It refers to our capacity for play, a capacity that we
share with other animals, but which Huizinga argues is an important element of
culture. He identiﬁed ﬁve elements of play: it is free, it is not ‘real’ life, it is distinct
from ‘real’ life in location and time, it creates order, and it is not connected to any
material interest or proﬁt. One point to note is how different such a concept of play is
from the instrumental and goal-directed accounts of intelligence we examined
earlier, which characterise intelligence by referring to the goal(s) at which it aims,
whose presumed value undergirds the value of the intelligent activity producing it. In

other words, Homo ludens strongly suggests not activity directed at an end state that
is characterised externally to the activity but activity valued for its own sake, the
journey not the arrival.
5.4
Human Nature
211
Homo faber—man the maker—is another strong contender for expressing our
most characteristic attributes. The notion that humans alone use tools or make things
has been shown false by animals such as the bower bird and primates, but it would be
hard not to notice that no other animal has launched a rival to the international space
station, and although bower birds collect and arrange various items, no bower bird
has set up a world-class museum with several miles of corridors exhibiting bower
bird art and artifacts spanning a couple of millennia, with a gift shop and a café
selling light lunches, exquisite pastries, and a selection of hot and cold beverages.
Humans have. Perhaps Homo faber also captures the notion that humans are
characterised by their activity of making rather than as the possessors of things
that have been made—again, by an activity undertaken, rather than as creatures
striving towards an end state.
Nonetheless, the concept of Homo faber has been used as a critique of certain
views of the relationship of humans to technology. August Comte proposed that we
should see the world only through observable empirical phenomena and use our
knowledge to build technology that would transform our lives for the better to create
a heaven on earth. Past views of the human person as uniquely valuable creatures of
God, or seekers after goodness, truth, and beauty, are no longer needed in this
technological world. Hannah Arendt critiqued Comte’s views and warned of the
dangers of redeﬁning human nature as Homo faber, with its focus on mere technical
skill and away from wisdom [41]. Erik Larson suggests that the greatest achievement
of our species would be to build ourselves [9, p. 66].
Note, however, that Arendt’s criticism is focused on the particular worldview
advocated by Comte, where all knowledge rests upon a stark empiricism, which
includes human beings. For contrast, consider the teleological view of the world, a
richer notion of craftwork working in some manner of harmony with natural
resources and human skill, and the view of humans as seeking eudaimonia, which
could perhaps support an account of human nature that gave a central place to our
activity of making and of technology that did not have such radical implications for
reshaping our natures.
Both Homo ludens and Homo faber place an emphasis on activity and agency,
albeit in rather different ways. However, Homo sapiens surely has agency as an
implication, because to be wise implies the impetus to seek wisdom. Nobody is wise
who can’t be bothered to ever seek knowledge or explore the world around them.
Exercise 15
‘The creation of AI is entirely characteristic of human beings, because much of AI
research activity could also well be characterised as a form of play for those
conducting it, and moreover, it has produced many ways of connecting socially
online, not to mention countless games. Moreover, having released us from the
drudgery of work, we will now be able to devote more and more of our time to play.
This is a great step forward for humanity’.

212

Humans and Intelligent Machines: Underlying Values
Is such a view at all plausible? In addressing such questions, it is always useful to
consider the strongest possible arguments from all points of view.
Last, what of Homo religiosus? The term is associated with Mircea Eliade, but
there are also many other ﬁgures in the history of thought who have considered that a
religious impulse is central to human beings [42]. We seek meaning, some sense of
purpose in the world, we have a sense of wonder, a sense of something grander than
our immediate lives, a sense of a source of value outside of ourselves. A lack of any
such a sense can often be bewildering and demoralising. Even without a speciﬁcally
religious or a spiritual framework, a sense of awe and wonder at the world is
experienced by billions of us. Recall Psalm 8: ‘When I consider thy heavens, the
work of thy ﬁngers, the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained’. Such wonder
can also inspire curiosity and fascination at the world, which drives so much art and
science. However, this need not be instrumental; we can explore the world in many
ways just for its own sake. Many scientists pursue their work out of sheer love for the
subject matter. Such a view of humanity sits uneasily with a purely instrumental
account of our intelligence. My son’s ﬁrst word was ‘bird’, uttered as he pointed to a
colourful parakeet ﬂying across the park. What was his small mind trying to achieve,
other than joy and delight at the world and a connection with his mother as he shared
his excitement?
It is often helpful to consider if some religious impulse lies behind some attitudes
towards AI. Conversely, some working in science and technology may be explicitly
anti-religious. ‘Debunking’ explanations that attempt to reduce purported claims of
meaning and value to ‘nothing but’ are legion. Paradoxically, some of these may be
driven by a kind of fervour and insistence more characteristic of a religious
world view.
One might also note that these characterisations of the essence of human nature
are all to a degree positive. We seem to have a pretty good view of ourselves, but this
need not be the case. Dostoevsky’s embittered anti-hero of Notes from Underground
suggests that we should rather be characterised as an ungrateful biped [43]. Such a
characterisation does indeed probably serve as a deﬁnition that no other creature
shares, especially if I consider the hens we kept who always seemed inordinately
grateful, overjoyed even, for every scrap of food. However, we want more than this.
The ways in which we look for deﬁning characteristics strongly reﬂects prior
judgements of value about ourselves as a species.
The essence of human nature and claims of uniqueness Many who attempt to
ﬁnd the essence of what it is to be human have endeavoured to ﬁnd something that
only humans have. As such, these claims have frequently been vulnerable to
counterexamples from the animal world. Few who have watched orangutans
laughing will doubt their capacity to do so and may be more likely to marvel with
envy at their capacity to laugh with such utter abandon and joy. Note that this is not
necessary to be able to uniquely describe a kind, because a unique cluster of
attributes also does the job, but its prevalence as a strategy may indicate that it
matters to us for some reason.

5.4
Human Nature
213
Exercise 16
How much does it matter to us that we are unique in some way? The answer to this
question for some people will be ‘not at all’, but why has some claim of uniqueness
been so prevalent? How might this impact upon claims of commonality with other
human beings?
Does the possibility of developing AI threaten any such claims to uniqueness?
There is no essence to humans Existentialism has denied that there is any ﬁxed
essence that deﬁnes human beings. We do not ﬁnd ourselves in the world with a
ﬁxed essence. Rather, we exist ﬁrst and then deﬁne our essence. This is a view
presenting us with limitless freedom to make what we will of our lives. This may at
ﬁrst sound like a license to behave badly. However, note that Jean-Paul Sartre
considered that when he makes a moral choice, he chooses in anguish, for he chooses
for all mankind [44].
Humans as essentially social As we have seen, Aristotle stressed the intellect but
also insisted that we are not just rational but also social animals. The topic of
friendship received more attention in his Nicomachean Ethics than any other. He
was a biologist as well as a philosopher and points out the particular importance of
social connections to humans in comparison to other animals, noting that for grazing
animals to live together amounts to little more than sharing the same pasture, but for
humans, it involves sharing conversation and thought [6, Book IX, Ch. 9]. Although
we now know far more about the capacities of other animals than Aristotle did,
including the complex societies found in primates, a contrast is still drawn with
human societies as more sophisticated but with greater capacity to conceptualise
social relations and to reﬂect upon and judge them.
Are human beings essentially social? The answer to this question will have a
profound inﬂuence on ethics. Some more modern views have characterised human
beings as atomistic, isolated individuals, and from this starting point, the sceptical
question of ‘why should I be moral?’ is asked [45]. The source of the motivation to
act for others seems mysterious, if each one of us is conceived of as sealed within our
own bubble. A view more grounded in our biological natures, where none of us
could possibly spring up out of nowhere, with no relations to other similar creatures,
may ﬁnd it easier to begin an answer to the question of ‘why should I be moral’? (see
Sects. 5.4.4 and 1.4).
5.4.6
The Divided Self and Notions of the ‘Higher Self’
It is very common for accounts of human nature to posit divisions within the self,
often in a certain tension with each other, sometimes with struggles for control
between different parts, and often with different values given to different parts.
There are so many variations that it is impossible to do more than offer a couple of
examples and point out some features of interest to us.

Humans and Intelligent Machines: Underlying Values
For example, Plato posited a tripartite soul consisting of the logos, the reasoning
part of the soul, which regulates the other parts; thymos, a spirited part of the soul;
and eros, the desiring part of the soul [5]. There are no marks for guessing which part
he thought should be in control; note the resonance with the drive to develop
artiﬁcial intelligence, which seems so obvious it hardly needs stating. Note also
that the parts of the self (soul in this case) that are to be kept in order are those most
related to bodily functions and shared with the so-called ‘lower’ animals, a common
theme. There is a clear hierarchy of order here, with the implication that it is at least
in theory possible to attain inner harmony with reason in charge.
A rather different model comes from Sigmund Freud. As a result of his work in
psychoanalysis, he divided the mind into the ego, the superego, and the id [46]. The
id is the instinctual part of the mind with aggressive, sexual, and other bodily drives.
The superego operates as a moral conscience, judging the urges of the id, and the ego
is the part of the self that is acting to the reality principle, trying to please the id in
ways that the superego will tolerate. This model posits a more complex and
pragmatic negotiation of harmony between the different parts of the self. Reason
has a role to play but is not ‘king’.
There are so many other possible accounts of splits in the self that it would take a
multivolumed book to recount them all in depth. Many readers will doubtless know
of a plethora of other examples. A key issue for ethics arises from claims frequently
made about the relative ordering of the self and the value judgements attached to this.
An extremely rough and ready generalisation can be made as follows.
Mind
Intellect
Reason
Calm, logical
The ‘nice’ bit
Must be in control
Domination OR
Harmony with other elements
Body
Animal
Emotion, impulse, drive
Powerful, unruly, somewhat scary
The ‘naughty’ bit
Must be controlled
Kept in check completely OR
Put in its rightful place in balance
Don’t read this too literally. There are multiple variations and some signiﬁcant
departures from this crude chart. It will be useful to consider nuance, counterexam-
ples, and outliers. However, it can serve to illustrate some general tendencies and
commonalities within a range of views.
The place of AI within this schema may seem ﬁrmly in the left column. The uses
of AI to attempt to combat human partiality, unreliability, and impulses in assisting
us to reach good decisions ﬁt well with this (notwithstanding the small point that AI
is built by these emotion-ridden humans).
Do dreams of uploading the mind to computers include uploading the experience
of a bad mood caused by a bout of indigestion? Possibly not, but should they? Some
attempts to recreate humans by collating a large mass of data about an individual are
attempting to capture memory and personality, which includes emotions and other
factors on the ‘body’ side. However, visions of uploading minds bear some resem-
blance to the visions of a life of abstract contemplation envisaged as the life of the

Philosopher Kings of Plato. Science ﬁction makes a contribution to such questions in
exploring possibilities, which, even if never realisable, can help us to imaginatively
respond to fundamental questions about who we are and why our lives matter.
5.4
Human Nature
215
The nature of self-mastery Another important point of debate concerns the nature
of the divisions within the self insofar as these divisions are captured by the
relationship between reason and emotion (some such division is frequently made,
sometimes using different vocabulary).
The inﬂuential instrumental account of intelligence we referred to earlier places
goals as external to intelligence itself. This then posits a split between intelligence
and our goals, which puts our goals outside the reach of reason. Recall Russell and
Norvig’s discussion of Aristotle’s claim that we deliberate about means but not
about ends. Note that an account such as Plato’s where the reasoning part has the
ability to control the other parts of the self is critically different: on Russell and
Norvig’s account, it’s not at all clear how intelligence (reason) can control goals
(desires). In fact, it seems clear that on this account, it cannot. As we have seen, this
view is disputed.
5.4.7
Reason or Emotion?
There are many ways of characterising the broad division referred to here, including
different ways of understanding reason. ‘Emotion’ is used as an approximation for
aspects of our inner experience that may also be labelled drives, desires, feelings, and
so on. While many accounts of human nature stress reason, some making it entirely
in the ascendant, others wish for it to curtail only other elements of the self, such as
emotion, insofar as they are too dominant or operate out of place. For a simple way
of illustrating this, one may think of how Plato saw the Guardians as living a very
simple, austere life governed by duty to the state, where the highest aspects of life
were contemplation of the abstract ideas (sounds a little boring eh). Contrast this
with the notion of the middle way within Buddhism, where a mean between
extremes of self-denial and excess is sought, in a way somewhat similar to Aristotle’s
doctrine of the virtuous life as the mean between two extremes [47]. Plato’s account
of human nature stressed the intellect, the soul, the abstract, whereas Aristotle
viewed us not simply as rational but as rational animals and also as essentially
social animals. These views on the self make an important backdrop to attitudes
towards technology and what we hope for its role in the future of human life,
especially envisaging societies where we live increasingly enmeshed with intelligent
machines. Such debates are all pertinent to the question of how we may or may not
be able to harness AI to ‘improve’ on human nature.

Humans and Intelligent Machines: Underlying Values
David Hume: Reason the Slave of the Passions
David Hume (1711–1776) was a Scottish philosopher, historian, and econo-
mist known for his empiricism and sceptical views on many philosophical
questions.
He considered that all substantial knowledge of the world was gained
through the senses, dividing all knowledge into either ‘matters of fact’ or
‘relations of ideas’, in what has become known as ‘Hume’s fork’. Matters of
fact give us knowledge of the world gained from our senses. Relations of ideas
are judgements about that empirical knowledge, such as mathematical knowl-
edge, which gives us no substantive knowledge of the world.
He also made a sharp divide between belief and desire. Reason is ‘inert’,
meaning that reason alone can never lead us to action. Hence, no knowledge
we have gained about the world can ever, on its own, tell us what to do, prompt
us to action. Only desire can do that, or what Hume called ‘the passions’.
‘Reason is, and ought only to be, the slave of the passions, and can never
pretend to any ofﬁce than to serve and obey them’, he famously wrote in his
Treatise of Human Nature, Book III, Part III, Section III [48].
This means that, for Hume, all motivations to act, including ethical judge-
ments, are fundamentally based upon desire or emotion. Such a view has been
very inﬂuential among many philosophers who hold a ‘noncognitivist’ view of
ethics that moral judgements are based upon feelings, desires, or emotions,
rather than on claims about the nature of the world.
Hume’s account has also been seen as inﬂuential in belief–desire–intention
models of action. A set of beliefs, in combination with a set of desires, gives
rise to an intention, which leads to action. Beliefs alone cannot do this, on this
model.
This model also chimes neatly with instrumental accounts of intelligence,
which see intelligence as the capacity to reach goals. Intelligence involves
capacities of reason and the capacity to acquire knowledge, but the goals
themselves are thus conceptualised as external to intelligence.
Likewise, we can consider the example of the Romantic movement, which
rejected what they saw as the excessive emphasis on reason and intellect of the
Enlightenment and of the Rationalists. Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley’s novel Fran-
kenstein belongs to the movement of Romanticism, which emphasises the power and
force of nature and of imagination, feeling, and passion, the importance of the
individual (although Mary Shelley herself stresses the importance of sympathy,
cooperation, and family relationships) [49]. Strong echoes of certain elements of
Romanticism can be found in some critiques of AI and of modern technologies in
general. For example, in his chapter ‘What is a person?’ from You Are Not a Gadget,
Jaron Lanier writes that digital culture sees all reality, including people, in terms of
information and turns our attention to a network as an abstracted picture of a
multitude of individuals, and the real people who go to make up this network and

who are the source of its meaning may be overlooked [50, p. 17]. In a sustained and
detailed critique, he explores how the foundational values and modes of application
of new technologies may be morphing human nature and our experience of the world
and each other.

Exercise 17
Jaron Lanier writes of a new culture where all of reality, including us, is seen in terms
of information [50, p. 27]. Consider the implications of seeing humans as having the
same essential nature as the rest of reality and of seeing us in terms of information.
Argue for and against the notion that developments in technology and its applica-
tions have produced a tendency to see individuals merely as bundles of information.
5.4.8
The Boundaries of Human Nature
A key trait of human beings is our adaptability and our capacity to learn, change, and
grow. There are divergent views about the ﬂexibility of our capacities and traits, the
scope of our potential for good or for ill, and different judgements about attempts to
transcend current human limits and our capacity to survive, in some way, such
transformations. A notable trait of human beings is their capacity to accommodate to
different environments, including extremes of temperature and external conditions—
from the Arctic to the Sahara and from the moon to under the sea. Some of this
capacity relies on advanced technology, while some does not. Humans have adapted
to extremes of social situations, including natural disasters and social and economic
catastrophe. Conversely, there are many circumstances in which human beings will
be broken, physically, emotionally, and morally. Views on such questions underlie
the question of using AI to enhance or to transcend human traits.
The limits of human nature and our moral capacities Some individuals demon-
strating the capacity to survive even the most inhumane abuses meted out in
concentration camps, even when stripped of virtually all the protective technology
that humans have created—minimal clothing, no personal possessions, and no
capacity to communicate outside the enclosed world of abuse [51–53]. Reading
personal accounts of such experience is awe-inspiring and humbling, two totally
inadequate words to capture my admiration at the strength that humans can manifest.
On the other hand, such examples also show that humans can survive situations that
should never have arisen. The need for such adaptations may indicate not just that
extremely harsh circumstances happen to arise but also that a great wrong has
occurred. Moreover, some adapt to such situations in ways that are individually
dysfunctional (although such a claim will always involve value judgements) and/or
that demonstrate moral corruption, such as those who collaborate with captors in
meting out extreme cruelties to others. A simple way of expressing these points is
that under extremis, human beings have the capacity both for growth and moral
courage and for dismal personal and moral failure. See Chap. 6 for a discussion of
phronesis, or practical wisdom.

218

Humans and Intelligent Machines: Underlying Values
The changes wrought to society by the introduction of new technologies can be
transformative of ways in which we live, introducing opportunities and challenges.
Exercise 18
The adaptability of human beings is also a critical factor in envisaging future
scenarios where technology has continued to have a great impact on social, cultural,
and economic functioning. Could humans adapt to large-scale technological unem-
ployment, for example? What kind of changes, if any, do we need to bring about to
make this achievable, and what kinds of changes, if any, do we need to bring about to
make this desirable? Note that given the capacity of humans to endure appalling
conditions, these are deﬁnitely different questions.
Transcending the limits of our intellect and moral capacities with AI Measures
of adaptability are one factor by which humans and intelligent machines are com-
pared. In measuring intelligence, François Chollet describes extreme generalisation
from one learned situation to another as currently only existing in biological
organisms, with human-centric extreme generalisation manifesting both in situations
that an individual has never before encountered and in situations that no human
being ever has encountered [54, p. 11]. Is the structure of our minds determined in
some way, laid down by some cognitive infrastructure, running according to certain
rules or programmes, or is its potential less constrained? The answer to this question
will act to shape our attitudes towards human potential in comparison to the
capacities of AI and has also shaped research in AI [54].
It is common to consider the mind as constrained by the development of the brain
in stages from our evolutionary past. We have certain ﬁxed ways of interacting with
the world and of thinking that may be maladaptive in certain circumstances. For
example, Daniel Kahneman’s work on Thinking Fast and Slow, which was intro-
duced earlier in Sect. 4.1, exempliﬁes an inﬂuential approach that aims to identify
the ways that the echoes of our evolutionary past and the structure of our nervous
systems constrain our thinking [55]. Note that this evolutionary view often goes
along with a mildly depressing take on humans as a species but may also be
accompanied by the trope of progress as an extrapolation forward from our halting,
imperfect evolutionary development is envisaged. We may make the best of what we
have by being careful to note the typical errors and fallacies to which we are prone.
In addition, we may look to machines. There is considerable hope that AI may assist
us to transcend the limits of our ‘wetware’, a term that may be used neutrally to
describe the information processing that goes on within living cells but which is
sometimes used in a derogatory fashion in comparing human intellect to computers.
Characteristic reasoning errors and the pushes and pulls of human emotion and
partialities are commonly seen as shortcomings that we need to eliminate and may
need AI to achieve.
Exercise 19 Human Nature and the Virtues of Our Boundedness
Perhaps the ultimate dream of human adaptability is the vision that we could both
survive and even enjoy having our minds ‘uploaded’ to a machine. For this to count
as closely as possible to survival of an individual human being, what qualities of

mind and thought would need to be uploaded? What capabilities would the machine
need to have? Of course, you may consider that such uploading is not possible, but
even so, try to get as close as possible to a full uploading scenario. You may also
wish to reﬂect on the uncomfortable issue of what happens to the human being in
question. (We will return to such issues later when we further consider the question
of mind and body and of the identity of persons.)

5.4.9
Boundaries and Limits
As human beings, we have certain limits. We exist at a certain time and in a certain
place. We are born and we die. There are limits to our knowledge, memory,
understanding, empathy, and abilities. Our vision is pretty good, although restricted
to what we arrogantly call the visible spectrum. Our hearing is so-so. We cannot ﬂy
from Europe to Southern Africa without a plane or a satnav, as certain birds can. We
can memorise a shorter string of random digits than chimpanzees can.
We are individuated by the limits of our bodies, even if we are more than just our
bodies. This is an essential aspect of our moral universe. Even if we have very close
ties to other human beings, we are still separate people, and the gulf between us
means we have different points of view, different stances on the world. It presents the
challenges and the distinctive shape of communication and understanding and its
lack between us. It creates moral problems and helps to shape how we address them.
These limits placed on us by our biological embodiment shape a large part of the
ethical challenges we face. This distinguishes us from AI, including from robots, in
many ways.
Are these boundaries merely limits? The gulf between us and others is often
responsible for cruelty, neglect, and more mundane selﬁshness. Precisely because
there is this gulf between us and others, it also forms an essential element of how we
think of the virtues, or moral goodness. I expect no praise for feeding myself when
hungry. However, if someone goes out of their way to provide food for those
without, especially if they have to make substantive sacriﬁces to do so, this may
attract moral praise. Those whose actions for others result in extreme sacriﬁce, such
as risk of life or even death, are called heroes or saints, precisely because they are
mortal and because we, the admiring throng who are not so brave, know what they
have given up. It may be that it is often our very ﬂaws that enable us to empathet-
ically relate to others in ways that enable us to help them. The notion of ‘the
wounded healer’ has a long history.
The ways in which we are bounded may help map out some of our ﬁnest
moments, as well as our worst. If we think of technology as the attempt to exceed
our boundaries, there may be a difﬁcult balancing act to be had regarding which
limits we should try to overcome and which we should leave alone. Recall our
discussion in Chap. 4 of the object of morality.

220
5
Humans and Intelligent Machines: Underlying Values
Exercise 20
We often fail to understand others, even those close to us, and may misinterpret
words and fail to read emotions adequately. This communication gulf is a major
stumbling block between us. Recall our discussion of Neil Lawrence’s analysis of
embodiment factors and differences in data processing speeds between humans and
computers in Sect. 5.2.6.
Now consider the use of AI to improve our understanding of those close to
us. Researchers at the University of Southern California have been developing
multimodal wearable technologies to detect psychological states to enable a partner
to react accordingly [56]. One aim is to predict conﬂicts before they occur [57]. Per-
haps an alert might let you know that your partner will be tense and upset when he or
she returns home today. You might decide to delay that talk you were going to have
about the housework and have a drink and dinner ready. Perhaps you could set up an
app so that ﬂowers were automatically ordered every time the technology indicated
that your partner’s mood had dipped after your last conversation.
Consider the ethical implications of the widespread use of such technologies and
how they might impinge on our relationships. Consider the ethical implications of
the use of such technologies to improve the care of people living with advanced
dementia who may have limited capacity to consent to their use.
Consider different reactions to such technology from those who (a) tend to stress
the importance of individual rights and protections or (b) tend to stress the value of
community and relationships.
5.4.10
Is Human Nature Perfectible?
There are many different views on the question of the perfectibility of humanity.
These attitudes form a backdrop to visions of transhumanism and the improvement
of human beings individually and human society in general via AI and other forms of
technology.
Out of the crooked timber of humanity, no straight thing was ever made
(Aus so krummem Holze, als woraus der Mensch gemacht ist, kann nichts ganz Gerades
gezimmert warden.)
Immanuel Kant, Idea for a Universal History from a Cosmopolitan Perspective [58]
Attitudes to perfectibility also speak to general stances towards ethics: perhaps it
is accepted that we will never ﬁnd a ‘perfect’ account of ethics and of living well in
this world and that compromise and doing the best under the circumstances are all
that can be hoped for.
John Passmore’s book The Perfectibility of Man gives a detailed examination of
this topic, spanning 3000 years of views on mankind’s perfectibility from philoso-
phy, theology, politics, and science and technology [59]. Even so, there are many
traditions of thought from around the world not included in the book but it nonethe-
less provides interesting source material for reﬂecting on how notions of perfection

enter into our ideas of morality, on trying to determine ethics for AI, and on how
technologies such as AI may assist humans to progress. Greek legacy was to
establish a metaphysical ideal of perfection, identiﬁed with a supreme Being, either
distinct from or identiﬁed with nature. Humans were seen as being able to share in
this perfection, at least to some extent, a perfection that involved attaining knowl-
edge and a rational understanding of the universe. There is a tension between views
that attaining this knowledge involved withdrawal from the world and those who
held it could be achieved within an ideal society. Meanwhile, there is a lower level of
perfection in the form of standards of morality for the ordinary citizen on the path to
perfection. The achievement of perfection is unsurprisingly considered extremely
hard; for many such as many in the Christian tradition, perfection within this life has
been thought impossible, although others have demurred and sought it in this life
through various means, and progress towards perfection is sometimes seen as
something requiring the grace, the assistance of God. Attempts to seek perfection
include striving to conquer the desires of the ﬂesh and of the self.
5.4
Human Nature
221
Ideas of perfection of the human race as a whole have been expressed through the
eugenics movement which we mentioned earlier, which has a sorry history of forced
sterilisations and of the denigration of some parts of the population as unﬁt, yet
despite this, some consider that new technologies mean that it will continue to be
practiced [60]. Some vigorously defend modern reproductive technologies such as
embryo selection and prenatal testing as enabling ‘liberal eugenics’, premised on
choice [61]. Modern methodologies such as the CRISPR technique, which enables
possible gene manipulation, may herald even greater capacity to shape our biological
futures [62]. The potential prospects of increasing divisions between different
individuals and groups parallel some of the issues we potentially face with devel-
opments in AI.
We can trace strands that can recur in some accounts of our use of technology: the
control of the body, the emphasis on knowledge of the highest form, the emphasis on
the mental, the control of society, and different positions on elitism: the question of
whether all people will be able to beneﬁt from this, or only some.
5.4.11
Myths and Origin Stories About Human Nature
Many cultures and religions make claims about the origins of human beings. These
take many different forms but may indicate how humans are seen in relation to the
rest of the natural world and any role they are assigned, as well as sometimes
indicating a view on the strengths and weaknesses of human beings. Sometimes
accounts take the form of an imagined golden age. Origin stories may be signiﬁcant
for understanding hopes for the future, for how time is thought of, and for notions of
the unfolding of time and history and notions of progress.
Myth Zero Many will consider that they do not believe in, nor are they inﬂuenced
by, any myths or origin stories about humanity. However, this is unlikely to be true

because such people will probably believe evolution to be true and thus may have
beliefs about the human species based on seeing humans as ‘nothing but’ the product
of evolution. Moreover, we are often guided by myths embedded in our culture of
origin without realising that we are reproducing their patterns. Evolution is ‘just’ a
scientiﬁc theory describing and explaining the origin of species, but it is often
associated with certain attitudes. These may include considering that modern
humans are just a passing species in an ever-changing panoply of species, to be
replaced at some time in the future by other hominids more adapted to the environ-
ment, or destined to die off in a mass extinction, all part of the chance passing of
evolutionary time and no particular loss to the world. (Oddly, such people may
simultaneously mourn the extinction of every other species.) It may partake of the
view of evolution which slips from using function as part of biological explanation
to talking of purpose as if evolution was heading towards some goal with humans as
part of this and project that our descendants will go on to greater and greater ‘ﬁtness’,
extrapolating to greater intelligence on most accounts. (Projections sometimes
include pictures of humanoids with feeble muscles and massive heads.)
222

Humans and Intelligent Machines: Underlying Values
What has this to do with us? The answers to ethical questions about the more
distant future with AI, including questions around human enhancement, the possi-
bility of large-scale technological unemployment, and the possibility that we might
be controlled or exterminated by some super-intelligent AI, all depend upon the
answer one gives to such questions. It is of course perfectly possible to be neutral or
agnostic about such answers, but one’s views often emerge in considering future
scenarios where the continuation of the human race is in question.
Exercise 21
Some futurists consider that eventually, humans will be ‘replaced’ or superseded by
AI descendants or replacements for our limited species. Others consider that AI
could be used to enhance us as a species.
What views would we have to take of human nature in order to consider this could
be possible? Might something be irretrievably lost? What shortcomings of human
beings might be improved by AI?
Some also envisage that eventually the human race might split into two: those
who are enhanced (perhaps by AI and/or by biological means) and those who are not.
What difference might this make to our ethics were this to occur? How much do you
consider that your views on morality are based upon an assumption of basic equality
of value between all humans, would splitting our species into two make an impact on
this, and if so, how?
We will consider these questions again in Chaps. 10 and 11.
5.4.12
Some Helpful Questions to Ask About Human Nature
It will be apparent that one could spend one’s whole life examining different
accounts of human nature. Luckily as fascinating as this might be, there is no need

to do this in order to make progress in advancing discussion in AI ethics. Some key
questions to consider may be useful in identifying areas of disagreement or impasse
in debate, as well as in reﬂecting on one’s own views, for certain issues in AI ethics,
and indeed, for understanding some of the ideology driving some visions of AI. This
suggested list of questions is not meant to imply that any particular answer is right or
wrong. The list is not exhaustive.
5.5
Key Points
223
Are assumptions being made regarding any special role that humans have in creating
the future?
Is there a belief that human beings can be understood in precisely the same way as
any other part of the natural world?
Are humans understood in purely material terms? That is (roughly), that we could
understand everything there is to know about humans, in terms of the basic
physical laws of the universe?
Are humans thought to be essentially mental beings? How are the particular facts of
human biology regarded? Are there claims that human beings could transcend or
escape their bodies in any way?
Are claims being made about a central essence of human beings?
Are some aspects of human beings seen to be higher than other aspects? What
assumptions are being made about how humans could be made better?
5.5
Key Points
To assess the value of AI, it is essential to consider how we understand and value
intelligence. We need to consider how intelligence is understood in relation to AI
and to human beings, any differences, and how comparisons between AI and
humans are made.
There are multiple ways of characterising intelligence. In AI, intelligence is
sometimes depicted in terms of the capacity efﬁciently to achieve goals. However,
reference to goals is less common in general accounts of intelligence. This instru-
mental account of intelligence that may be used by some working in AI needs to be
considered carefully, as it could have a large impact on how we understand, value,
and use AI and the ethical issues arising.
The way in which intelligence is valued may have implications for how we value
both human beings in general and individual humans in particular. When valuing
intelligence, it is critical to consider what it is we value about it, the speciﬁc context
of application, and what else we might value and might lose by focusing too much on
certain aspects of intelligence only.
Look out for any assumptions regarding the value of knowledge, information, and
data and the values involved in sharing and communicating knowledge, information,
or data.
There are many different accounts of human nature. Assumptions about human
nature can underlie some of the major divisions between those with different

approaches to questions in ethics and in AI, including broad cultural differences and
differences in worldview. Understanding some of the ways in which assumptions
about human nature can differ will help in advancing discussion over many central
disagreements in ethics.
224

Humans and Intelligent Machines: Underlying Values
Ideas of human nature underlie many of the questions in AI ethics, concerning
questions such as what failings humans have, how humans may be improved, their
place in the natural world, and any role they may have in creating the future.
The simple step of asking what broad assumptions are you and others are making
about human nature can be helpful in advancing understanding of some questions in
AI ethics.
5.6
Educator Notes
The question of the different ways in which intelligence is understood is important
for many of the ethical questions in AI, including many of the questions we discuss
in later chapters. For students with less time, Sect. 5.2.1 should provide an adequate
introduction to the main questions.
Some students may ﬁnd the general topic of human nature somewhat abstract,
which is one reason why this chapter has provided many exercises designed to link
these philosophical issues to more concrete issues and examples that pertain to the
use of technology.
For students with less time and different sets of interests, some of the exercises
could be set as stand-alone work to introduce the students to the general issues. The
material on human nature may be of great interest to those with backgrounds in
subjects such as philosophy, theology, and anthropology, who may have a lot to
contribute to class discussions, but even those students who ﬁnd the topic rather
abstract, it is common to have some assumptions about human nature, and the
exercises will help to alert students to these issues.
Many exercises ask students to consider very broad philosophical questions, and
there is no expectation that they will necessarily be able to provide rigorous answers,
although many students will have particular and valuable viewpoints and material to
bring to bear. Some students may ﬁnd Exercises 2, 5, 8, and 18 more tangible than
others. Exercise 7 focuses directly on a claim about the value of intelligence
frequently cited by some publicly prominent individuals, which may usefully raise
some central ideas: we have looked at this previously, and this gives a chance either
to look at it for the ﬁrst time or to review opinions based upon what students have
since learned.
Debate and extended project and essay topics Exercise 8 could make a good
structured classroom discussion about the nature and value of data from different
points of view, which could be very useful preparation for much later work. Exercise
12 on embodiment and its signiﬁcance could be interesting for some students as an
essay or discussion topic, and it is a topic that is very challenging but that will

reappear later in various guises. Exercise 16 on human uniqueness could be a good
debate topic. It may be challenging for students to articulate but will be a good
preparation for some later work that concerns reductive accounts of mind and body
and personhood, which are relevant to some key ethical questions in AI.

Normative Ethical Theory and AI Ethics
Abstract Normative ethical theories propose frameworks for determining value
and for guiding judgment and action. We examine three dominant varieties: conse-
quentialism, focusing on outcomes of actions; deontology, focusing on the nature of
actions themselves; and virtue ethics, focusing on the moral character of the agent.
There are signiﬁcantly different varieties of each. Here, we outline the main charac-
teristics, drawing attention to those features that lend themselves most readily to
application in the context of AI, as well as giving an overview of the particular
difﬁculties of each approach. We discuss different conceptions of the end goals of
ethics, including different conceptions of happiness, pleasure, preference fulﬁlment,
and the question of measuring outcomes. These all have implications for the ethical
assessment of the development and deployment of AI and for implementing ethics
within AI. The application of ethical theories to situations of rapidly changing
technology presents many challenges. Likewise, accounts of agency and its moral
relevance within different normative ethical theories are critical when considering
the use of machine agency to enhance or replace human agency. The interpretation
and following of moral rules are addressed; questions include the development of
global guidelines for AI and the implementation of ethical rules within AI.

Introduction to Normative Ethical Theories
Summary
This chapter presents three normative ethical theories that are frequently used in
applications of theory to concrete cases: consequentialism, deontological theories,
and virtue ethics. These are outlined, and the applicability of each of them to the
ethical questions in AI will be considered.
Normative ethical theories propose frameworks to determine what is right or wrong,
the basis for moral judgments and actions. This chapter examines the major norma-
tive ethical theories that have tended to dominate the contemporary discussion of AI

ethics in the West. These have come to the fore within a particular tradition of
philosophy, and neither do they exhaust the possibilities, but nonetheless have
helped shape work in applied ethics, so they are important to understand. Examining
points of strength and weakness in each will facilitate constructive engagement and
understanding of divergent approaches. Theories can be wrong for interesting
reasons; both the strengths and the weaknesses of the normative ethical theories
we look at here can shed considerable light on AI ethics.

Normative Ethical Theory and AI Ethics
Within the Anglophone sphere of analytic philosophy, by the early twentieth
century, many working in philosophy had taken the view that it had little to say about
practical ethical issues in the real world. Philosophical questions focused on logic
and on the analysis of language in what has been called ‘the linguistic turn’. There
are close links between the claims that we can understand the world through the
analysis of language and that a formal system such as that of logic or mathematics
might capture the world and describe it completely and the development of computer
science. The inﬂuence of such thinking, and responses countering it, can be found in
many areas of philosophy, including ethics. Please note that this is a very brief
account of these developments, and it must be remembered that philosophical work
in other parts of the world, including continental Europe, developed in rather
different ways.
In ethics, questions were mainly concerned with metaethics, or the broad nature
of ethics: questions about the nature of moral knowledge, the foundations of ethics,
the relation of ethics to the natural world, the meaning of ethical statements, and so
on. Many were of the view that ethical statements had no real content but were
merely subjective expressions of opinion or emotive responses to situations. Recall
the outline of Hume’s view given in Sect. 5.4.7. In the ﬁrst part of the twentieth
century, the Emotivist theory of ethics earned the nickname of the ‘boo-hoorah!’
theory of ethics, which captures this view precisely [1]. But the events of the
twentieth century made it amply clear to many that such a position was no longer
tenable, and there was a rise in philosophers concerned with practical issues, such as
the use of nuclear weapons, abortion, and other issues. The attention given now to
pressing issues in AI ethics can be seen in part to be a new version of such a wave.
It may be helpful to recall now as we struggle with AI ethics that 70 years ago or
so, philosophers and others interested in pressing ethical questions were also won-
dering how to proceed. Many contributed to such developments. The philosopher
Elizabeth Anscombe wrote an inﬂuential paper, ‘Modern Moral Philosophy’, asking
how we could argue in ethics when any agreement on any set of rules, duties, and
obligations seemed increasingly illusory [2]. Her work was inﬂuential in a move-
ment that persists to this day, which looked back to the virtue ethics of Aristotle as a
basis for practical consideration. Much philosophical work stemming from
Anscombe and close associates such as Philippa Foot, Iris Murdoch, and Mary
Midgley started to concern practical moral issues [3].
At around the same time, the philosopher R. M. Hare argued that starting from an
analysis of the meaning of moral terms alone, one could conclude that morality
consisted in sets of rules, or universal prescriptions for action, contrary to the views
of many others [4]. His views are no longer much discussed, but nonetheless, there

are many who consider that there are certain rules and values that are shared widely
enough to form the basis for much practical ethical reasoning. In AI ethics, these
may include the value of individual autonomy and privacy, as well as work referring
to universal human rights.
6.2
Normative Ethical Theories: Consequentialism
231
Meanwhile, there had been a continuous body of work taking utilitarian, or more
broadly, consequentialist, approaches. The eighteenth-century philosopher and legal
theorist, Jeremy Bentham, whom we have already met, was a utilitarian, as was his
follower James Mill and James’ son John Stuart Mill. Utilitarianism in various forms
still ﬂourishes today and has a strong inﬂuence on much work in applied ethics, even
among those who are not pure utilitarians and who introduce additional
considerations.
It has thus become standard to divide ethical theories into a tripartite division of
consequentialist, deontological, and virtue ethics approaches. Consequentialist
approaches focus upon the outcome of actions; deontological approaches focus on
the rules that should be followed; and virtue ethics focuses on the character of agents.
Hence, between them, these theories focus on a wide range of relevant factors. This
classiﬁcation is, as ever in philosophy, somewhat oversimpliﬁed but very useful for
considering the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches to ethical theory in
addressing questions in AI ethics. However, this is by no means to say that this
cluster of theories between them encompass a complete view of ethics.
In this chapter, it will often be necessary to focus on central features and
simpliﬁed accounts of theories in order to explain issues of particular importance
to AI ethics. We will focus on application in the context of AI, the ways some
theories may seem to ﬁt or not ﬁt, and the difﬁculties arising. This is a continuation
of our discussion of methods in Chap. 4, when we introduced the question of what
framework of values might be used in reasoning and critique in response to concrete
ethical cases. As well as a discussion drawing out the implications for AI, the chapter
will serve as an introduction to these three different groups of theories for those with
little or no familiarity with this subject. There will be exercises relating the theoret-
ical issues to practical issues in AI.
6.2
Normative Ethical Theories: Consequentialism
Summary
Consequentialist theories focus on the outcomes of actions. This section examines
their attractions for AI, focusing mostly on utilitarianism. Their goal-based nature
may suit computing well, and it is easy to explain the attractions of the aim for
happiness or desire fulﬁlment. Problems arising include the precise speciﬁcation of
the ends of morality, the attractions of a world where utilitarian ends are fulﬁlled, the
value of individuals, and difﬁculties in dealing with ethical questions concerning
agency, an especially critical question in relation to AI.

Normative Ethical Theory and AI Ethics
There are many different types of consequentialist theory, with a multitude of
different versions, often produced in direct response to the various criticisms of
consequentialism [5]. Our discussion here will present only a simpliﬁed account of a
classical version of consequentialism, the most common variety being one form or
other of utilitarianism, which we have already met earlier in the book (see Sects. 2.
5.1, 4.1.2, 4.3, and 5.2.6). We are beginning our discussion with consequentialism
partly because in many ways it is one of the easiest theories to grasp in outline. In
addition, some of the central disputes in utilitarianism speak directly to some of the
major ethical questions raised by AI. A consequentialist approach may seem to ﬁt
particularly well with providing an ethical assessment of AI. However, utilitarian-
ism, and consequentialism in general, may seem to be a good ﬁt with AI only
because it acts to mask or fail to address some of the most trenchant ethical issues
facing AI.
A consequentialist theory claims that the best thing to do, morally, is whatever
will bring about the best overall outcomes. We thus need the following at a
minimum: an account of what outcome(s) to aim for; an account of how to aim for
that outcome(s); some way of measuring outcome(s), in order to compare different
courses of action; and an account of who or what matters in assessing and aiming for
the outcomes.
Commonly, a basic account of utilitarianism may hold that the outcome to be
aimed at is happiness and the absence of unhappiness, or pleasure and the absence of
pain; a variation is that the consequences to be aimed at are the fulﬁlment of
preferences or the satisfaction of desires. Recall our discussion of the experience
machine in Sect. 4.1.2.
Many versions of utilitarianism claim that we should try to maximise this
outcome, in other words, to strive for as much happiness and the minimum unhap-
piness (etc.) as possible. Other versions claim we should merely try to aim for a
sufﬁcient level. The question of how far into the future to assess consequences also
arises.
There are a variety of suggestions about how we should measure outcomes.
Recall Bentham’s feliciﬁc calculus, which we met in Sect. 2.5.2. Note that some
way of measuring outcomes is essential to consequentialism because it is an essential
part of its theory that speciﬁc courses of action are not in and of themselves
mandated or permitted; we choose actions only dependent upon what their outcomes
are going to be, so we have to compare and contrast possible courses of action.
The question of who or what matters is closely related to the nature of the
outcomes at issue. Bentham’s utilitarianism, which focused on maximising pleasure
and minimising pain, noted that ‘The question is not, Can they reason?, nor Can
they talk? but, Can they suffer?’ [6]. Jeremy Bentham himself was very fond of
animals. He had several cats, including one called the Reverend John Langborn. The
expansion to animals thus has been an important and signiﬁcant practical outcome of
much utilitarian thinking. For our discussion, however, we focus on humans and the
implications for AI. Again, since the focus is on the consequences of actions, the
issue of the future once again arises: the consideration of those who do not yet exist
inevitably and forcefully arise with utilitarianism.

6.2
Normative Ethical Theories: Consequentialism
233
We will examine these issues in turn, although they are interlinked in various
ways. The issues will be illustrated not only with exercises and cases concerning the
use of AI but also with discussion and examples from historical contexts. The
purpose of this is to demonstrate how much the current debates concerning novel
technologies are actually preﬁgured in philosophical debates and life episodes from
very different contexts. This helps to illustrate the universal human experiences that
underlie many current issues and acts as a reminder that there is much we can learn
from the past.
Consequentialist approaches can seem ripe for application to computing. A
consequentialist ethic could specify goals to be reached by software, and the
performance could be readily appraised. Often, the introduction of new technologies
is assessed by overall beneﬁts and harms. We saw in Chap. 2 how a common
element of codes of ethics and statements about ethics in AI is the aspiration that
AI should beneﬁt all (see Sect. 2.4.4). Calculating best outcomes seems an obvious
thing to want to do, but immensely complex, so perhaps AI could help us with this,
especially as the difﬁculty of calculating consequences is one of the major criticisms
of consequentialism. Moreover, looking to the future as consequentialism inherently
does may make it seem ideal for assessing this technology that is carrying us forward
into the future.
Let us see.
Consequentialist approaches have also been applied (albeit often with certain
limitations) in areas of public policy, where decisions concerning the distribution of
goods and services over populations have to be made in situations of limited
resources. Limitations imposed generally take the form of side constraints: certain
actions may have the best overall consequences but would have very deleterious
impacts on individuals or groups. These may be recognised by the acknowledgement
of fundamental human rights. These side constraints may be applied in addition to
the assessment of consequences, but they may also be pragmatically adopted for the
sake of public acceptance of policy.
In philosophy, it is often easier to ﬁnd fault with a position than to give it a fair
assessment. Even if one wishes to reject a position entirely, it is a good strategy to
look for its good points, both for what one might learn oneself and also for
understanding why someone else may take a very different viewpoint. It’s not
usually because they are stupid or bad. It’s usually for some fairly good reason.
Exercise 1
‘The question is not, Can they reason?, nor Can they talk? but, Can they suffer?’
(Bentham) [6]. Consider whether there is anything strange about using an ethical
theory that explicitly argues for the irrelevance of reason as a basis for understanding
artiﬁcial intelligence.

234
6
Normative Ethical Theory and AI Ethics
6.2.1
Outcomes of Actions: Pleasure, Pain, and Preferences
Outcomes matter, but how much? It is almost impossible to quarrel with the idea
that outcomes matter in ethics. If ethics does not result in a better world, what use
is it? Disagreements arise when a theory claims that only consequences matter, as
any strict version of consequentialism must claim. Many of the exercises we have
looked at so far raise this issue in one way or another.
Exercise 2
Review your response to one or two of exercises you have previously completed, for
example, the exercises in Sect. 2.4, and consider to what extent the issues raised
concerned whether or not the outcomes alone were what mattered, or if there were
other issues that also mattered, such as how the means used to reach the outcome.
Exercise 3
Some principle that ‘AI should be beneﬁcial to all’ is frequently cited in codes and
statements concerning AI ethics.
How would you provide more details on this statement in order to produce any
practical guidance?
This is a very broad question! Don’t spend too long on it. Its purpose is to orient
you to some of the major questions we will look at in this section.
The attractions of happiness It is also easy to see the attractions of the goal of
seeking happiness and the avoidance of unhappiness, or pleasure and the absence of
pain. These relate to the quality of our experiences. How could these not be relevant
in some way? It’s perhaps most convincing if we consider the avoidance of pain or
suffering. How could this not be relevant, especially when we consider the inﬂiction
of suffering on the innocent? If one wanted to ﬁnd a point of agreement between
those of different backgrounds and views in a discussion of ethics, then an example
of the gratuitous suffering of the innocent is one that is most likely to attract
universal condemnation. The goal of eliminating unjustiﬁed pain seems on the
face of it, an obvious good.
Moreover, an account of ethics on happiness and unhappiness, pleasure and pain,
has a twofold attraction: it seems ripe to form a basis for explaining our motivations
to act, since it seems to demand no explanation at all as to why we wish to avoid pain
and why we pursue pleasure (although there are serious problems in trying to explain
why we would care about the pleasure or pain of anyone else, a question we put to
one side for now). It also serves well for those who wish to provide a purely
empirical account of ethics. We seem to have to refer to nothing more than our
own internal biologically based drives. As Bentham wrote, ‘Nature has placed
mankind under the governance of two sovereign masters, pain and pleasure. It is
for them alone to point out what we ought to do, as well as to determine what we
shall do’ [6].
As an aside, this conception of happiness points directly to the quality of
experience and helps highlight the relevance of conscious experience to issues in

ethics and raises another critical question in ethics: is consciousness necessary in
order to qualify as meriting moral concern? This question features prominently in
debates about the moral status of AI itself, which we examine in Chap. 12. The
nature of happiness is also a critical question to address if we want intelligent
machines to be able to understand and to measure ethical outcomes based upon
assessments of happiness and pain.
6.2
Normative Ethical Theories: Consequentialism
235
These questions arise in relation to many of the practical ethical problems
concerning AI. How happiness is understood will shape responses to visions of
possible technological futures and to the use of speciﬁc discrete forms of technology.
Exercise 4
Think of examples of the use of AI that could be argued will increase happiness over
a population. Possible future projections include the development of a future
superintelligence that keeps humans as contented pets, or future large-scale techno-
logical unemployment, where a large portion of the population has no role in society
other than being provided with needs by automated means while being kept happy in
a world of endless entertainment tailored to individual tastes.
What could be said for and against such worlds? You may wish to base this on
your favourite sci-ﬁbook or ﬁlm. Focus speciﬁcally upon the idea of using AI to
produce happiness.
Hedonic accounts of happiness The classical utilitarian view of happiness sees
it as pleasure and the absence of pain, a view of happiness focused on the sensations
we feel. This is the hedonic conception of happiness. Although the attractions of
happiness as a basis for ethics seem obvious to many, plenty of others have railed
against the view that happiness as nothing more than a sensation, a feeling, and
pleasure should be the foundation of ethics. Some who object may wish to offer an
alternative account of happiness; others reject the very idea of basing ethics on
happiness.
In gaining an understanding of this account of happiness, it is important to note
that utilitarians such as Bentham insisted that, other things being equal, all forms of
happiness were of equal value (see Sect. 2.5.2). Pushpin is equal in value to poetry,
so long as they produce the same amount of pleasure. The Victorian essayist and
historian Thomas Carlyle famously regarded utilitarianism as ‘pig philosophy’ for
promoting the pursuit of such a hedonic notion of happiness. It is easy to dismiss
Carlyle’s view as nothing more than Victorian prudery and snobbery, based upon the
denigration of pursuits that gave pleasure to ordinary people, but it may be salutary
to consider the different forms of pleasure or happiness that modern technology
enables and indeed encourages.
In an interesting aside, a day of great unhappiness for both Carlyle and John
Stuart Mill was the day when Mill’s maid accidentally lit a ﬁre using Carlyle’s only
copy of his major work, The French Revolution: A History, entirely destroying it
[7]. Carlyle and Mill remained friends, for a while at least, although it must be said
that the accounts of the incident left by the two men vary somewhat. Carlyle rewrote

the book from scratch. (Any time you accidentally delete an important ﬁle, remem-
ber this.)
236

Normative Ethical Theory and AI Ethics
Exercise 5
Consider a few different sources of pleasure that are enabled or facilitated by forms
of AI, including if you wish imagined future possibilities. Would you consider these
all of equal moral value? As contributing in the same way to a good life?
Consider if any of these might be ones that might have attracted the scorn of
critics of utilitarianism such as Carlyle.
Consider the availability and ease of access of such sources of pleasure. Is this
(a) a good thing or (b) a problem, or (c) something more nuanced?
More than a feeling? Regarding the hedonic notion of happiness, how we expe-
rience things in the sense of how they appear to us is the critical question. However,
many examples indicate that it is not only the raw quality of experience that matters.
We have already considered this question when we looked at Nozick’s Experience
Machine in Sect. 4.1.2. You may wish to review this and consider if your reactions to
it are the same as when we ﬁrst looked at it.
Suppose that the Metaverse became such high quality, and automation took over
food and energy production and other work, to such an extent that there was mass
unemployment, but that society had the resources to allow billions of humans to live
life in the Metaverse, experiencing excitement, thrills, moments of calm content-
ment, as if they were living a full and rich life in the ‘real’ world. Suppose at the
same time, the people running the Metaverse were actually living lives that closely
mirrored the lives created artiﬁcially for the billions inside the Metaverse. Would it
matter who you were?
Now for the next iteration of this thought experiment. Perhaps it is only the rift
between ‘real’ life and a simulated experience that matters. AI is being developed
that aims to completely capture a person’s appearance and voice so that these can be
simulated realistically. This could also be used to augment a person. If you were to
have an online relationship with a person whose appearance had been augmented in
some way, for example, a colleague working in a branch ofﬁce on another continent,
would you feel tricked to meet them in real life and hear their true, squeaky voice and
see their pimply face? How about if the person was a date? Perhaps it’s only
disappointment that is the problem. Or do we value the truth, per se?
We will return to these issues later in discussing metaphysical questions and their
relevance for ethics in Chap. 7. We will also need to examine the question of why we
value the truth, and given that we do, whether this means we want the truth, the
whole truth, and nothing but the truth—in other words, if more knowledge is always
better. This is a perplexing question in ethics and in philosophy and one with
profound relevance to many of the issues in AI.
We have examined various uses of technology where the question of truth and
reality is potentially an issue. Examples include Deepfakes, the mimicry of human
voices, and the use of VR. Different issues could be at play in different instances.
Perhaps it is the attempt to deceive that is at issue; perhaps it is ﬁnding out that one

has been tricked; perhaps the choice of an individual to experience a constructed
reality rather than something veridical, ‘missing out’ on something real. Perhaps it is
the opposite—putting up with dull reality, when one could have something better.

Exercise 6
One. Imagine you have a life partner who has gone away for several weeks for work.
Each night, you have an intimate friendly chat with them online and greatly
appreciate it. After a few weeks, a technical glitch reveals that you have been
communicating with a sophisticated AI. Your partner explains that work has been
‘extremely busy’. How do you react?
How much does truth matter over quality of experience?
Two. Recall Chap. 2, Exercise 10, in which an app on a screen allowed for remote
monitoring of an elderly person living alone. Suppose the person was living with
dementia and came to think that the person behind the app really was their friend. In
fact, it’s a series of different paid employees, each with several clients, or perhaps an
AI which performs this role and also does so for 50,000 clients.
Does the truth matter, or just the quality of the experience? If you thought
differently about this example than in the ﬁrst case, why?
Higher and lower pleasures As with many of the issues that are being presented to
us through the capacities of technology, the philosophical underpinnings have
already been the subject of discussion. As we have seen, one element of the debates
concerns the veridicality of experience—whether it matters that what we experience
corresponds to the way the world is or whether it is merely the subjective quality that
we ourselves experience that is at issue. The subjective quality may have some value
in and of itself. But is the veridical experience better? If so, why? This may be
because we ‘value the truth’, but there may also be additional ways of expressing
what matters.
Carlyle’s criticism of utilitarianism as a ‘pig philosophy’ hinged on the idea that
mere brute happiness could be the basis of ethics, with Bentham’s insistence that all
forms of happiness of whatever source were essentially morally equivalent being one
important root of the issue. John Stuart Mill disagreed strongly with Bentham on this
and, in Chap. 2 of his Utilitarianism, distinguished between what he called higher
and lower pleasures [8]. Interestingly, Mill gave more than one account of the
distinction. Lower pleasures were nonetheless pleasures. But if someone with
sufﬁcient knowledge of two sorts of pleasures would prefer one over the other,
even if it was accompanied by a greater amount of discontent and even if presented
with an unlimited amount of the other pleasure, the preferred pleasure is the higher
pleasure [8, Ch. 2, paragraph 5]. This deﬁnition has occasioned much critique. Mill
went on to explain higher pleasures further, suggesting that these were associated
with higher faculties and that ‘a being of higher faculties requires more to make him
happy, is capable probably of more acute suffering, and is certainly more accessible
to it at more points, than one of an inferior type; but in spite of these liabilities, he can
never wish to sink into what he feels to be a lower grade of existence’ [8, Ch. 2,
paragraph 6]. Mill considered that this unwillingness could best be explained as a

facet of our sense of dignity. Recall, too, our discussion of the common feature of
theories of human nature that they often have an account of better or worse aspects of
our natures. Mill has been accused of elitism for his views.
238

Exercise 7
Recall Exercise 16 in Sect. 2.5.2, which contained a passage where Mill argued that
few humans would agree to trade places with any of the lower animals, no intelligent
person would agree to become an ignoramus, and review your answer.
Consider if Mill’s account of higher and lower pleasures is of any relevance in
considering the value of various uses of AI. Bring in any examples that you wish,
and/or look over previous cases and exercises.
A eudaemonic conception of happiness In contrast, a eudaemonic idea of happi-
ness considers it as something attained over an entire life span, where the fulﬁlment
of projects, the development of character, and the achievement of life satisfaction
within a whole life are what matters. Such a conception of happiness is found in the
works of Aristotle, whom we discuss both here and in the section on virtue ethics
(Sect. 6.4).
There are many things to consider in comparing and contrasting each of these. For
instance, to continue on our theme of measurement, a eudaemonic conception of
happiness lends itself less readily to measurement. Our assessment of how happy we
were at a particular time may readily change on reﬂection and as we come to grow in
understanding of the nature of our life’s experiences and undertakings and their
place and meaning in our lives. The components of happiness may be more complex,
and it does not focus upon sensation. The happiness of a life seems something that is
assessed perhaps more thoroughly in retrospect. A feliciﬁc conception seems more
suited to measurement and analysis, as if it was, as it were, a series of passing
moments of happiness or pleasure. However, even on the level of subjective
experience, things can be very complex. A sports match spent on the edge of
one’s seat in agonised tension as one’s team is seemingly thrashed may quickly
become thought of as the height of enjoyment as a last-minute series of goals turns
them into winners. We take pleasure in certain things, yet we seek them for their own
sake, not simply for the pleasure they will bring. The US Declaration of Indepen-
dence refers to inalienable rights given to all humans by their Creator, of ‘life,
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness’. Happiness itself could never be guaranteed.
However, the pursuit of happiness can be self-defeating if it aims too directly at the
quality of happiness itself. Often, seeking pleasure itself will be self-defeating, and
many pleasures are self-limiting [9, 10].
Compare the discussion of the value of intelligence and of human nature in
Chap. 5. Consider an instrumental account of intelligence, as efﬁciently reaching
our goals, and consider the value of thinking as a process. Might we even enjoy the
struggle of thinking through a difﬁcult question? Why do some people enjoy the
cryptic crossword more than the easy version? Recall the discussions of different
views of human nature, including different ideas of human essence. If we are
creatures who make things, Homo faber, this may mean we value the end product,

but we may also value the process. If we are creatures who enjoy play (Homo
ludens), this suggests we enjoy activities for their own sake. There are other aspects
you may wish to consider.
6.2

Exercise 8
What uses of AI, if any, are best equipped to help us with the pursuit of happiness?
Do any uses positively interfere with this? Hint: This again is a very broad and
difﬁcult question intended to provoke and provide food for thought.
A eudaimonic conception of happiness suggests that we have some conception of
how our life should go and what kind of shape it should have. There are many things
that could shape this. There will be individual and cultural factors here, for instance,
the pursuit of individual satisfaction over a life, the pursuit of meaningful connec-
tions with others, and the achievement of some lasting goal. Frank Sinatra’s song My
Way is often played at funerals, but many ﬁnd this empty. A sense of progress is
often implied. A life which starts off with a bleak and unpromising beginning and
then makes progress, even if modest, is generally preferred to a life with the same
total amount of happiness but which starts off well and goes downhill from there.
However, this sense of progress is generally not a simple matter of plotting isolated
measures of happiness and unhappiness on a graph. Indeed, if we were to try to think
of our lives and experiences as simply isolated passing points of happiness and
unhappiness, this would be difﬁcult if not impossible, because we assess and review
the quality of our experiences within the framework of a narrative structure, not to
mention that the way we process memories is far from a simple photographic record
keeping of the past [11].
One of the challenges of a future that is perhaps very different from the lives of
the past, if technology is truly transformative, is to have any idea of how we would
measure the shape and trajectory of a life against this. If the singularity occurs, then
this implies we will have no conception against which to measure the way that a
life goes.
Exercise 9
How might we measure happiness or welfare, or assess happiness over a lifetime,
after the singularity has occurred? The serious point is to raise the question of how
we plan for a future that is hard to imagine.
‘Call no man happy until he is dead’ In his Nicomachean Ethics, Aristotle raised
the question, ﬁrst posed by Solon, an Athenian statesman and poet, of whether it was
possible to call anyone happy until they were dead and raised the question of
whether something that happened after death might make a difference to how well
one’s life had gone [12] (Chap. 10). Aristotle scholars have differing views on what
his answer was [13].
For the ancient Greeks, social connections and reputation were important, so that
for instance, if after death, one’s son turned out to be an utter rascal, a traitor to the
state, for example, that would mean that a signiﬁcant part of one’s life’s course had
gone awry. So let us pause and consider the impact of social reputation on our

happiness, on how our lives go, on ethical questions, and the impact of new
technologies.
240
6
Normative Ethical Theory and AI Ethics
The eyes of others Our social reputation, what other people think of us, is impor-
tant in some way or another to virtually everybody. Feedback of information about
our behaviour from others is an everyday part of human life. We are social beings.
We have to understand how our behaviour impacts others in order to navigate the
world, even aside from any ethical considerations. Recall our discussion of
Goffman’s notion of front and back stage in Sect. 3.6.2. The use of technology has
greatly magniﬁed these possibilities, increasing the amount of information collected,
the manner in which it may be collected, and the possibilities of analysis and
interpretation, for example, the potential use of facial recognition in CCTV in public
places. Our social reputations are now considerably inﬂuenced by the information
collected by us online. It is more than likely that this will impact not just our
behaviour. It may also impact how certain ethical questions are understood.
Exercise 10
Feedback from others online, such as ‘likes’ on social media, can have a large impact
on behaviour [14, 15]. Research indicates that certain groups are especially suscep-
tible to this, among them teenagers, especially girls, but certainly not limited to this
group [16]. For example, comments on appearance can feed into the use of ﬁlters to
modify appearance, and behaviour may be adjusted or manipulated in various
other ways.
Consider how responsibility and agency might be understood with regard to this
issue. Again this is a very broad question.
Control To what extent is our happiness under our control, and to what extent is it
shaped by circumstances about which we can do little or nothing? The quest to
insulate our lives from such externalities has shaped a great deal of moral philoso-
phy. In her work, The Fragility of Goodness, Martha Nussbaum explores how the
ancient Greeks dealt with the problem that many of the possible constituents of a
good life are outside of our control [17].
Over the centuries, one popular basic move is to make one’s happiness to be
centred on one’s mental attitude towards the circumstances of life, on the life of the
mind, and away from material goods. Plato and Aristotle both recommended the life
of the mind, and the Stoics as well as many religious traditions have emphasised the
importance of pursuing spiritual goals rather than seeking ‘treasure on earth, where
rust and moth corrupt and where thieves break in and steal’ (Matthew, 6:19) [18].
Exercise 11 Food for Thought
Consider the basic stance of ﬁnding happiness in sources that are relatively resistant
to the vagaries of chance.
Is a path of seeking control of our lives through technology a way of trying to
protect ourselves from the vagaries of luck using material goods, a polar opposite of
the age-old suggestions of avoiding dependence upon external things?

6.2
Normative Ethical Theories: Consequentialism
241
Consider too how the fear that we may not be able fully to control AI is a central
issue in AI ethics.
A different approach in preferences or desires These and other problems have
led to versions of utilitarianism that aim to maximise the satisfaction of desire or
preferences. For a desire to be satisﬁed, it’s not enough that you think it’s been
satisﬁed. Something needs to have changed in the world. On most versions, it’s also
necessary that there is a connection between this change and you: if you don’t know
about it, or do know yet subsequently realise that this is not what you actually
desired, many would hold that this did not count towards satisfying your desires. So,
there is an element of subjective experience, your knowing on this, plus the objective
truth of the change in the world that corresponds to the fulﬁlment of your desire.
Basing ethics upon the fulﬁlment of desires or preferences has, in common with
happiness, an intuitive simplicity and appeal because fulﬁlling desires seems to be a
basic way of capturing the idea of making adjustments between us and the world.
Again, as with the negative of happiness, pain, it’s easier to relate to this in the
negative. A world in which no desires were fulﬁlled and no preferences were
satisﬁed seems unutterably bleak.
However, just as many have argued with happiness, desire or preference satis-
faction does not seem to be enough for morality. In some possible cases, it seems to
be positively opposed to ethics if happiness is attained by a sadist and if desires are
for harm to others. How could someone’s trivial or banal desires form any kind of
basis for moral obligations on the part of others? How could a person’s desire to get
more ‘likes’ on TikTok be anything other than some trivial irrelevance?
A response to this could be to apply the same reasoning to almost any human
pursuit. Vanity, vanity, all is vanity.
My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;
Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!
Nothing beside remains. Round the decay.
Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare.
The lone and level sands stretch far away [19].
So wrote Percy Bysshe Shelley, telling of a traveller who describes a ruined city
found in a desert. Again, such age-old questions about how to live have real
application in relation to AI. Although these questions are perennial, we should
consider the sheer scale of the possibilities created by technology. We seem to be
designing technologies that could tune into every minute desire we have, anticipate
them even, satisfy them as fast as possible, cater to our every whim, and design
imaginary worlds where new desires can be found. Is it the case that the more desires
we have, the more desires are fulﬁlled, the better our lives go? Or are we looking in
the wrong place?
Desires and an instrumental account of intelligence If we understand our pref-
erences and desires as expressions of our goals, then this account could ﬁt well with
an instrumental account of intelligence, but any problems with a desire or
preference-based account of utilitarianism could then herald problems with this

account of intelligence. If we just take our desires or preferences as we ﬁnd them, as
just ‘facts of the matter’ grounded in empirical reality, this might give us some
reasons for action, but does it persuasively produce a strong basis for ethics? What is
a possible solution?
242
6
Normative Ethical Theory and AI Ethics
Ranking desires We may need to rank desires or preferences in some way. A
famous paper by the philosopher Harry Frankfurt described ‘higher-order desires’, or
desires about our desires [20]. For example, we may desire to respond to an
annoying tweet but also have a higher-order desire not to engage in such puerile
stupidity. In such a way, we may order our desires and reject acting on some
altogether, based on nothing more than on our own desires.
But does this just push the problem elsewhere? There is only a nest of desires;
some wished for more than others. Other approaches may rank desires depending on
factors such as the nature of the desire and external rankings of value.
Ranking Desires and AI Alignment
How is this relevant to questions in AI ethics? One example is the issue of how
we align AI to human values. To do this, we need to determine what these
values are. Many examples of AI gone wrong are of cases where the initial
speciﬁcation of what the human designer wanted inadvertently clashed with
other more important desires of the designer. There are various possible
permutations of this, but the worst cases are those which lead to catastrophic
situations up to and including loss of life.
Isaac Asimov’s Robot series of stories often deals with such cases, where a
desire would have been obvious to humans but was unspeciﬁed to the machine
[21]. Nick Bostrom’s well-known paperclip example given in his book
Superintelligence, which we will discuss in Chap. 10, is of a similar type.
An AI, instructed to make paperclips, ends up turning the entire world into
paperclips in what Bostrom dubs ‘perverse instantiation’ [22].
Ranking desires would only work in such cases, however, if these desires
were entered into the machine. Hence, Asimov’s 0th law of robotics has to be
explicitly added to the robot’s instructions: a robot may not harm humanity or,
by inaction, allow a human to be harmed [23].
In an attempt to address the concerns Bostrom raises, Stuart Russell pro-
poses teaching AI to extrapolate human desires and preferences from observ-
ing our behaviour [24]. We discuss this in more detail in Chap. 10.
Desire and manipulation I have taught utilitarianism to ﬁrst-year philosophy
students for many years. Some of the best fun of my life. Students typically react
favourably to desire-based accounts of utilitarianism, but their faces fall after I ask
them a few simple questions. It usually goes something like this: pointing to a piece
of technology, whatever it is at the time, the latest iPhone or whatever, I ask them if
they desired to buy it or desire to upgrade to the latest model. The answer is usually

‘yes’. I then do this irritating thing and point out to them that ‘when I was your age’, I
had no such desire yet was perfectly happy. Why didn’t I desire it? Because it didn’t
exist. When we wanted to talk to our friends, we walked around the corner and
knocked on the door or went to the public phone box and made a call. On the minus
side, we also desired ﬂared jeans (I still like them, within limits).
6.2
Normative Ethical Theories: Consequentialism
243
A central feature of many desires is that they can be manipulated, sometimes
deliberately, sometimes by the strong yet often unnoticed forces of social pressure.
Even something as fundamental as desire for food can be moulded in ways that can
do us disservice. Indeed, we often attempt to manipulate our own desires when we
try to control them. We may try not to act on certain desires, to postpone acting on
them, or to quash them altogether. We may also try to induce certain desires in
ourselves. Taste for food can be acquired, so we can sometimes expand our
repertoire of foods by repeatedly eating things we don’t like.
The behaviourists discovered that desires could be induced with ease under
certain settings. Pavlov’s dogs learned to salivate on the sound of a bell rather
than to food itself. Animals can hence be trained to act in certain ways for rewards
[25]. Pigeons can thus be trained to play the piano. We can also be trained not just to
play the piano but to spend hours and hours of our lives, no, months and months, no,
years and years of our lives, chasing desires that have been induced in us by
technology and its design. Those dealing with issues such as drug dependence and
gambling addictions are also very well aware of how chasing desires may dominate
and in some cases ruin lives. One problem is that the strength of an urge to satisfy a
desire may not correlate very well with even our own assessment of the value of that
desire, as compared to other desires we have. Recall our discussion of accounts of
human nature that posit some form of split in the self in Sect. 5.4.6. For those
inclined to base ethics upon the satisfaction or desires or preferences, there are
serious questions, given the multiple ways our desires may be exploited. Are these
simply attacking vulnerabilities in the system which can be patched? Or do we need
to base our ethics upon something more robust than the satisfaction of human desires
or preferences?
Exercise 12
Comparing how technology may facilitate the creation of desires, in relation to its
capacity to facilitate access to information.
Could health tracking apps and the possibility of earlier diagnosis of disease
create desires for particular sorts of knowledge about ourselves? Could this be a
good thing?
Refer to Sect. 3.3.4 and our discussion of the technological ﬁx and Chap. 3
Exercise 6 on the use of machine learning in the early diagnosis of dementia. You
may wish to consider other examples of your own.

Normative Ethical Theory and AI Ethics
6.2.2
Measuring Outcomes
Happiness, numbers, and formulae Can happiness be measured? This is an
essential claim of utilitarianism because if a theory aims to maximise, or at any
rate to increase, a certain outcome, it must be possible to measure outcomes in some
way in order to assess and compare alternative courses of action. (In contrast,
theories of ethics that hold that certain actions are duties, or are to be prohibited,
or hold that certain virtuous character traits are to be encouraged, are not so
committed to measurement and calculation.) This means that there must be some
standard approach across settings and ultimately that some kind of numerical or
comparative assessment can be made. Such measurement need not be fool proof. We
can only expect a certain level of precision in human affairs, yet measurement needs
to be ‘good enough’ to provide answers that are better than those of any serious rival.
Indeed, perhaps we can use AI to measure happiness in individuals? It can some-
times be hard to assess happiness in other people, and indeed, even in our own case,
we may sometimes lack the self-awareness to realise that some situations are making
us unhappy. Can AI know us better than we know ourselves? Perhaps an AI could
measure physiological signals of distress or calm, detect focus and attention, calcu-
late optimal levels of arousal, observe our behaviour over time, and work out
precisely how happy or unhappy each one of us is in certain situations.
Can happiness be captured in a formula, reduced in some way so that we can ‘do
the maths’? In its classical form, utilitarianism requires measurement and compar-
ison across a population for different possible scenarios. This also comes with a
standard assumption that different states of happiness can be equated or at least given
some equivalence value. We have touched on this brieﬂy in Sect. 2.5.2, when we
saw Bentham’s claim that, other things being equal, the simple game of push-pin is
of the same value as poetry. Why must this be the case? Because the need to
maximise outcomes necessitates comparison between possibilities.
Can happiness be calculated using clear and consistent formulae? Philosophers
and others have long debated such matters and have striven to provide as good an
answer as is possible. Attempts to measure happiness or well-being have risen in
popularity in recent years, with political criticism levelled at the failings of using
merely economic measures such as gross domestic product to indicate the state of a
nation and replacement with measures such as the Gross National Happiness Index
[26]. Any measurement will, however, make certain assumptions and choices about
what is measured and how comparisons are made. Perhaps this does not matter so
long as we are aware that a model has limitations.
What might be lost if we relied ‘too much’, whatever that means, on such
calculations? Can any attempt to measure happiness be anything other than a
rough and ready approximation?

Exercise 13
Argue for and against the proposition that an AI could, in theory at least, calculate as
well as, or better than, a human being, whether or not that person was happy.
Consider the use of technology already in existence and what technology might
need to be created.
Consider what would have to be included to provide a measurement of happiness,
and consider any differences between how AI might reach a conclusion and a human
being.
An Alchemy of Happiness
John Stuart Mill took numerous walking holidays both within England, often
in the Lake District, and on mainland Europe. He was extremely good at
blagging extended periods of sick leave from work and was often absent for
months on end. As we have seen, John Stuart Mill disagreed with various
aspects of Jeremy Bentham’s approach to happiness. This diary extract from
Mill’s friend Caroline Fox gives a charming account of his thoughts upon the
mystery behind calculations of happiness or unhappiness.
A walk with John and Clara Mill to Penzance and Penrose. . . . ‘Why’, said he,
‘Yesterday’s conversation made just the difference between my knowing and not
knowing your brother. Often it is an amazing assistance to detail a little of one’s own
experience when one has passed through similar discouragements yet come out of
them’. I remarked on the pleasure it must be to help others in this way. ‘I had much
rather be helped!’ he answered. The process of unhooking a bramble made him
philosophise on the power of turning annoyances into pleasures by undertaking them
for your friends—a genuine alchemy [27].
Exercise 14
Have you ever noticed that doing the washing up in someone else’s house never
seems as bad as doing your own washing up? There are numerous other ways in
which the calculation of pleasures and pains fails to ﬁt with a simple additive model.
Could an AI build such factors into account in producing a model for calculating
overall happiness across a population? Try to have as much fun as possible in
answering this exercise, and indeed, any of these exercises.
Exercise 15
Consider how these issues relate to the question of accountability. In his book On
Human Nature, Roger Scruton offers the opinion that the possibility or probability of
error in calculating consequences is a fundamental ﬂaw in consequentialism because
it means that wrongdoing is seen as nothing more than an error [28, p. 98].
If we were to use AI to make moral decisions, one issue frequently raised is that of
moral responsibility: we could not hold the AI responsible. Does this necessarily
matter, so long as outcomes were improved?

246
6
Normative Ethical Theory and AI Ethics
Would there be any advantages in viewing moral errors as simple mistakes of
calculation?
6.2.3
Whose Happiness Matters?
Note that for utilitarianism, ‘everyone’ counts (see Sect. 4.3). In its classical forms,
this was simply an assumption. Hence, the possibility of measuring and calculating
outcomes using computing could be extremely attractive to utilitarians. One reason
for this points to an additional feature of classical utilitarianism that the outcomes are
to be measured across the whole population. There may be some versions of
utilitarianism where, largely for pragmatic reasons, individuals are urged to concen-
trate on those closest to them whose lives they can most easily impact. However, the
slogan of Jeremy Bentham, ‘The greatest happiness for the greatest number’, means
that everyone is taken into account: ‘everyone to count for one and none for more
than one’ [6]. To consider a large population and to compare multiple different
scenarios sounds like an ideal job for AI. In fact, it seems almost inevitable that for
some public policy issues, computing power is very valuable, even a necessity.
So, the question is, who is included in this? We saw above that a focus on the
capacity to experience pain and pleasure automatically seems to extend the circle of
moral concern outside of the human species, a topic we have already discussed in
Sect. 4.3, where we noted that the expansion of moral concern is often taken as ipso
facto an indicator of moral progress. We have also considered in our discussions of
human nature the question of the place of humans in relation to the rest of the natural
world. A feature of utilitarianism appears to be that it gives great responsibility to
each of us as individuals to calculate the consequences of each of our actions. There
is no use saying, ‘someone else should do that’, because if they won’t, then I have to
take that into account in judging what to do. It seems to give no ‘moral time off’,
since every decision could bring about greater or lesser happiness. Hence, utilitar-
ianism can seem to give us at once a prime role, in having the capacity to judge and
act to bring about the best consequences, and a side role, in knocking us off the
pedestal of unique moral concern.
Exercise 16
Many are concerned about the possibility that AI may develop to a stage at which we
owe it moral consideration. For example, even if concerns that LaMDA may have
developed sentience, which we examined in Chap. 4, were unfounded, they still
express the thought that AI might in some way become ‘like us’ and merit treatment
other than as a mere tool.
Consider the end goals of different versions of utilitarianism: happiness and the
absence of unhappiness; pleasure and the absence of pain; and desire fulﬁlment or
preference satisfaction. Do any of these adequately capture concerns about the moral
status of sophisticated AI and how we should respond to it?

6.2
Normative Ethical Theories: Consequentialism
247
Future beings If utilitarianism concerns itself equally with all those currently
living, since it is focused upon consequences, it must also concern itself with
those yet to be born. It has long been realised that this presents problems for
calculating what to do (since it’s unclear how far into the future we must extend
the calculations) and also for the problem that our actions in the here and now will
affect not just how many people are born but who those people might be. One
strategy is to point out that the impact of any actions now will be hard to trace too far
into the future because of the uncertainties involved and just draw a line somewhere
that seems reasonable.
However, in the case of AI, this strategy may be less convincing. On the one
hand, in theory, utilitarianism, or indeed any other form of consequentialism, seems
ideal because it does concern itself with consequences far into the future. On the
other hand, it quickly becomes entirely speculative as to how to calculate them. We
are just grasping at straws. Vague promises of countless trillions of endlessly happy
immortal beings skipping out into the universe could be used to justify any amount
of misery in the present day. Perhaps to be workable, utilitarianism, or any other type
of consequentialism, needs to set its sights a little nearer to the present day.
The question of how far into the future to look is a problem concerning measure-
ment in utilitarianism but is also a problem of who counts and how much. Do those
who will exist in the future matter as much as we do, and if so, how do we include
this in any calculations? This is another example of a pre-existing issue which is
highlighted by ethical issues in AI when we come to consider the far future
implications of the adoption of certain technologies and the future visions to
which some aspire. There have been numerous discussions of such issues within
consequentialism [29].
Longtermism is an ethical stance that focuses on the values attached to the distant
future. A simple calculation shows its attractions [30]. If we take the number of
people alive today, (and this calculation would work even if we include sentient
animals as well), and even if we include their children and grandchildren, then, so
long as disaster does not strike, the sheer weight of numbers means that, on a
consequentialist framework, we ought to prioritise doing all we can to ensure a
good and happy future for those beings who will live long after we are all dead and
gone. This may initially seem an intuitively obvious stance, but its lure palls when
one considers that this may imply that to neglect the widespread poverty, disease,
and slavery rampant in the world today may be justiﬁed if all efforts were to be
placed into projects such as space travel to ﬁnd other habitable planets or into work
towards human enhancement to ensure the survival of a remnant of the human race
[31]. Maybe large sections of the human race could be killed as a means to ensure the
survival of a sufﬁcient number of humans to lead to future generations millions of
years from now. We will discuss this further in Chap. 10.

Normative Ethical Theory and AI Ethics
6.2.4
How Should We Aim at Happiness?
Do we aim for the maximum? In its simplest classic versions, utilitarianism aims
to maximise happiness and minimise or remove pain. As we have seen above, there
are many attractions of the goal of happiness but also many difﬁculties with how we
specify such a goal. In addition, there are numerous difﬁculties with attempting to
achieve the highest possible level of happiness. When utilitarianism has grappled
with the realities of how difﬁcult it can be to achieve its ends, these problems may
not be manifest. The utilitarian reformers of the nineteenth century were dealing with
large-scale social issues of access to education, appalling conditions in factories,
widespread poverty, and so on. Many of these could perhaps be seen more properly
as the combatting of misery rather than the pursuit of happiness. However, as
societies have become more afﬂuent, the question of whether we can have ‘too
much’ happiness arises. The prospects of achieving more and more happiness
through the use of technologies, for example, to take away the onerous parts of
labour and to tailor our worlds precisely to our liking, provide a means of testing
aspects of utilitarian theory. Perhaps it will not best serve human nature, and perhaps
chasing this will produce a world devoid of some of the central things we most value.
One of the reasons for using technology is to be able to achieve our ends faster, more
efﬁciently, and more thoroughly. This makes it more likely that we will be able to
achieve our ends fully. However, as we have seen before, ethical questions can arise
from differences in scale. The attractions of utilitarianism perhaps seemed most
visible for those social reformers who were battling large-scale social and economic
problems. These goals could perhaps more fairly be characterised as the alleviation
of suffering, together with enabling means by which people could work towards
their own happiness. Yet if AI gives us the possibility of reaching the goals of
eliminating suffering altogether and of enabling more and more of the population to
live a life of constant happiness, the attractions may pall. Some of the examples used
to demonstrate this refer to futuristic scenarios, but these can readily be transferred
considering the general issues raised which are relevant to the impact of some
technologies on a smaller scale and for issues that we currently face.
Again, this is not a new problem but is a problem made all the more vivid as
technology promises, or threatens, to deliver results.
Exercise 17 Food for Thought
While many developing, applying, and using AI focus on its speciﬁc capabilities and
applications, there is a tendency among some to imagine utopian visions of an
AI-powered world. Could a consequentialist viewpoint, aiming to maximise value
in the world and always aimed towards the future, help to aid and encourage such
utopianism? And if so, is this a good, or bad? (We will consider aspects of this
question again in Chap. 11.)
The power of technology and the dangers of success I indicated above that
utilitarian’s strengths are perhaps most visible and unproblematic when applied to
urgent issues such as the reduction of suffering. The problems of the world are

legion. But recall the optimistic notion we saw earlier in Sect. 5.2.5, expressed in
belief that all we have gained from civilisation is a result of our intelligence, and the
hope that AI will be able to solve problems such as poverty and disease [32]. This is
likewise aimed at relieving suffering, but why stop there? Suppose all such problems
were eradicated. What then? Consider an episode from the life of John Stuart Mill, as
he contemplated the completion of all of utilitarianism’s hopes.

‘The End Had Ceased to Charm’: John Stuart Mill and the Ends
of Morality
The utilitarian philosopher John Stuart Mill had a famously severe upbringing
at the hands of his father James Mill, protégé of Jeremy Bentham. James
attempted to instil the principles of utilitarianism in the education of his eldest
son John by showing what education could achieve from an early age: Greek
at 2, Latin at 8, political economy at aged 11. Interestingly, Bentham some-
what disliked James and disapproved of this strict upbringing, sometimes
giving John the children’s books his father did not permit him [33]. By the
time John was in his 20s, he fell into despair. His autobiography A Crisis in My
Mental History states, in Chap. 4:
From the winter of 1821, when I ﬁrst read Bentham, and especially from the
commencement of the Westminster Review, I had what might be called an object
in life: to be a reformer. My conception of my own happiness was entirely identiﬁed
with this object. . . . But the time came when I awakened from this as from a dream. It
was the autumn of 1826. I was in a dull state of nerves, such as everybody is
occasionally liable to; unsusceptible to enjoyment or pleasurable excitements; one
of those moods when what is pleasure at other times, becomes insipid or indifferent.
. . . In this frame of mind it occurred to me to put the question directly to myself,
‘Suppose that all your objects in life were realized; that all the changes in institutions
and opinions which you looked forward to, could be completely effected at this very
instant: would this be a great joy and happiness to you?’ And an irrepressible self-
consciousness distinctly answered, ‘No!’ At this my heart sank: the whole foundation
on which my life was constructed fell down. All my happiness was to have been found
in the continual pursuit of the end. The end had ceased to charm, and how could there
ever again be any interest in the means? I seemed to have nothing left to live for [34].
An interesting question arises as to whether this tells us simply something about
John Stuart Mill as a personality, perhaps something about the impact of his
‘utilitarian’ upbringing, or also maybe something more generally about the ultimate
ends of utilitarianism in particular and of consequentialism in general.
Exercise 18
This episode in Mill’s life can be used to reﬂect upon general issues about the
sources of human motivation. Consider the discussion of an instrumental notion of
intelligence in Sect. 5.2.1 and of the claims that we can apply intelligence to solve
our biggest problems. What if we could achieve a ‘perfect society’ through AI, might
we feel the same as Mill? If so, why, if not, why not? Recall also our discussions of
the object of morality in Sect. 4.3.1.

250
6
Normative Ethical Theory and AI Ethics
Consider our discussions of human nature in Sect. 5.4. Do you think humans
always need something to strive for? Or was Mill simply suffering from a bout of
blues? Is this something that some personalities might suffer from, but others not
so much?
Consider the case of an AI researcher, and now suppose that we have ﬁnally
achieved the perfect AI for every task and for the discovery of all scientiﬁc and any
other sort of knowledge. Is this a dream come true or a disaster of redundancy and
loss of meaning?
If we do need something to strive for, might we creep closer and closer to this
kind of ennui as machines do more and more for us, will we be content, or will we
simply ﬁnd more things to occupy ourselves and more goals to strive towards?
Be careful what you wish for: power and pleasure Moreover, the potential of
technologies involving AI towards control and systemisation, together with factors
such as the resistance of infrastructure to change, may only increase the possibility of
a uniform and totalising system (see Sect. 3.5 for discussions of assumptions of
consistency and uniformity in relation to technology). A totalising system may mean
more than the mere power to control large numbers of the population but also include
the imposition of a uniformity on what technology is aiming at. If there is a
mischaracterisation of the ends that a consequentialist ethic strives for, the dangers
of this control are only worsened. Suppose that instead of promoting the best we can
strive for, an instrumental account of intelligence, combined with a utilitarian ethic,
doomed us to a life of continual ‘lower’ pleasures. Conveniently for us, here’s a
picture of such a world that Aldous Huxley presciently prepared for us earlier.
Brave New World and the Gratiﬁcation of Desires
Brave New World by Aldous Huxley explores a dystopian future where
technology produces a tightly engineered world of pleasure-seeking individ-
uals governed by a sinister World State [35]. People are raised to ﬁt into
different hierarchical ranks, with interventions to produce people deemed
suitable for different roles. The perfect drug, soma, gives the perfect high,
and sex is used purely for entertainment. The technologies in question mostly
concern biological engineering, but the ideas that Huxley explores are still
very potent for considering the potential use and abuse of AI.
This is one of those many classics that is worth reading in detail. One scene
here gives a ﬂavour of the society that Huxley envisages. A group of alphas
(the top tier) is being addressed by the World Controller for Western Europe,
Mustapha Mond. The Director of Hatcheries and Conditioning’s (DHC) job is
to oversee the production of babies and the conditioning of children to prefer
their particular role in life. In one scene where he is addressing a group of
young people, he asks them if they have ever had to wait a period of time
between forming a desire, and having it fulﬁlled. One young man replies that
there was once a time when he had to wait 4 weeks before ﬁnally having sex
(continued)

with a particular woman. Mond elicits from him the admission that this period
of waiting produced strong negative emotions and explains that initially,
people were reluctant to embrace the reforms that allowed a world of fast
gratiﬁcation of desires [35]. How foolish they were!

Exercise 19
Have you ever had to wait 2 days for an Amazon parcel to arrive when you were
expecting it in 1 day? How did you cope? (N.B. since there are no emoticons in this
text, please add your own ‘humour’ emoticon.)
Living through a ‘long time-interval between the consciousness of a desire and its
fulﬁlment’ is otherwise known as delayed gratiﬁcation. The ability to delay gratiﬁ-
cation may be useful for success in certain domains of life. However, suppose it was
not needed? Consider if it could be discarded without loss. (Recall again our
discussion on the object of morality.) Consider the impact of the technologies that
surround us on the ease of desire fulﬁlment. Use speciﬁc examples where possible.
The ends of utilitarianism and human nature The utilitarian worldview at its
starkest is one in which calculations of human nature and of the world’s possibilities
can produce the easiest, softest, and most comfortable path for each one of us. Who
would not take this? We have already seen how Charles Dickens also argued against
utilitarianism in his novel, Hard Times [36]. Fyodor Dostoevsky in his Notes from
Underground, which we mentioned in Sect. 5.4.5, also railed against utilitarianism
through the diatribes of the central character, a bitter, anonymous middle-aged man,
in what is perhaps one of the most impassioned pleas against utilitarianism to date,
strongly suggesting that what we want above all is not an easy, happy, life, but one
that we ourselves have chosen and the exercise of our own agency [37]. This
amounts to a radical rejection of the central tenets of utilitarianism. It also amounts
to a radical rejection of the idea that ethics can be contained within a neat and tidy
system. His novel Crime and Punishment also serves as a stark critique of utilitar-
ianism [38]. The central character, Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov (spoiler alert,
although the plot is already widely known), is an impoverished student who makes
the cynical calculation that the life of an elderly money lender, who is known to be a
particularly unpleasant individual, is of so little worth that he is justiﬁed in murder-
ing her to steal her money.
Fyodor Dostoevsky, Notes from Underground: Utilitarianism and Human
Nature
I, for instance, would not be in the least surprised if all of a sudden, à propos of
nothing, in the midst of general prosperity a gentleman with an ignoble, or rather
with a reactionary and ironical, countenance were to arise and, putting his arms
akimbo, say to us all: “I say, gentleman, hadn’t we better kick over the whole show
(continued)

Normative Ethical Theory and AI Ethics
and scatter rationalism to the winds, simply to send these logarithms to the devil, and
to enable us to live once more at our own sweet foolish will!” That again would not
matter, but what is annoying is that he would be sure to ﬁnd followers—such is the
nature of man. And all that for the most foolish reason, which, one would think, was
hardly worth mentioning: that is, that man everywhere and at all times, whoever he
may be, has preferred to act as he chose and not in the least as his reason and
advantage dictated. And one may choose what is contrary to one’s own interests, and
sometimes one positively ought (that is my idea). One’s own free unfettered choice,
one’s own caprice, however wild it may be, one’s own fancy worked up at times to
frenzy—is that very “most advantageous advantage” which we have overlooked,
which comes under no classiﬁcation and against which all systems and theories are
continually being shattered to atoms. And how do these wiseacres know that man
wants a normal, a virtuous choice? What has made them conceive that man must
want a rationally advantageous choice? What man wants is simply independent
choice, whatever that independence may cost and wherever it may lead. And choice,
of course, the devil only knows what choice. [37, Part 1, VII]
Note that Dostoevsky is not simply making claims about ethical theory. He makes
some startling claims about human nature. Dostoyevsky may seem to be saying
something very counterintuitive to many people because it looks as if he is
suggesting the possibility of rejecting rationality itself.
There is a deep philosophical problem here. It is extremely difﬁcult to prove why
rationality itself is valuable, without assuming that it is. Recall our discussion of the
value of knowledge in Sect. 5.3, and consider too the value of the process of thinking
in and of itself. It is extremely hard to explain why we value these things, in and of
themselves. As a general strategy, look out for instances where critics of certain
views seem to be irrational, and always carefully consider the basis on which such a
claim is made. Some accusations of irrationality are better founded than others.
Exercise 20
The central character in Notes from Underground is a rather unappealing person, and
the views he expresses may seem unhinged. But consider the question of control and
surveillance presented to us by so many forms of AI. This could take many forms, as
can be seen in many examples and in cases discussed in previous chapters and in
exercises: control by governments and corporations through data tracking and
behaviour manipulation; control by employers; control by family members or within
healthcare settings; and control of our own behaviour by voluntary use of self-
tracking or health monitoring technologies.
Consider instances of control using AI that may result in beneﬁts. Do the thoughts
expressed in Notes from Underground about independent choice and the wish for
one’s own free volition help to capture concerns about such control? Consider
possible differences between various cases.
Exercise 21
Recall our discussion of the object of morality in Sect. 4.3.1. In a world where AI had
(somehow) managed to remove all sources of human suffering, what role, if any,
would there be for morality? How different might any morality be?

6.2
Normative Ethical Theories: Consequentialism
253
6.2.5
Consequentialism, Individuals, and Agency
A further source of difﬁculty for consequentialism concerns the ends to which it
aims. Utilitarianism aims to produce happiness and avoid unhappiness, pleasure, or
pain, wherever they are to be found.
Problems of distribution This latter sounds like a recipe for perfect equality under
a moral system, a form of protection of each individual, but alas, far from it. It is
simply a principle for counting the greatest happiness overall. Individuals can miss
out miserably. You do the maths. It’s easy to dream up endless scenarios where this
happens; it’s hard to prevent it. It seems as if individuals do not matter. If I can
improve my own happiness by an amount greater than the unhappiness I cause you,
then this is justiﬁed. Across a population, if one section suffers for the gain of many
more, then this is justiﬁed too.
Exercise 22
Consider that a large tech company was subject to a campaign to improve the
conditions of the workers assembling their products in extremely poor conditions
for very low wages. The company replies that they have calculated the costs of
improving production conditions but that only 20,000 lives would be substantially
improved, and yet 300,000,000 people would have to pay much more for their
laptops and smartphones, and remember, we need to take smartphones with us
everywhere now for various reasons, so they are basic necessities of life. Is your
response:
(a) Oh, that’s okay then
(b) This is dreadful
(c) Something more nuanced.
Consider how responses might change, depending on different circumstances and
contexts.
Naturally, philosophers have attempted many ways of circumnavigating this
problem, which are of great interest but which we will not explore here for lack of
space, save to note how the issue of distribution across a population is ubiquitous in
relation to AI as in so many other areas and to note that this readily becomes a
political issue, especially given the potential for power imbalances in who own and
controls technology. These ethical issues are of course ones where economics,
politics, and international relations, among other domains, are necessary for full
understanding and resolution.
On the plus side Recall that the focus on the outcomes may mean that beings
additional to humans matter. Any being that is capable of happiness, capable of
suffering, counts. This sounds great. ‘Everyone to count for one and none for more
than one’ [6]. However, note a corollary of this for how individuals are regarded.
Vessels of happiness ‘Everyone to count for one, and none for more than one’ turns
out to mean that they count equally in calculating total happiness. However, other

than this, the value of the individuals themselves as individuals seems to get lost in
the calculation. Likewise, preference-based versions of utilitarianism aim to satisfy
preferences or desires rather than to satisfy the individuals who have those prefer-
ences or desires. It is not the individuals who matter. It is the happiness production,
the preference satisfaction. Individuals are somehow reduced to mere vessels for
containing units of happiness and satisﬁed desires.
254

Normative Ethical Theory and AI Ethics
This is why I can increase my own happiness, at your expense. Not because I
matter and you don’t, but because neither of us do. Just the happiness matters.
Understanding what makes us happy A classical utilitarian position may be very
appealing to an empiricist worldview, as we saw in Sect. 6.2.1, because it can be
based upon a physiological account of what drives us. Hence, it may appear that we
can simply observe what we ﬁnd painful and what we ﬁnd pleasurable and base our
ethics on this. However, things are not so simple, as we have seen, since sources of
pleasure and pain can be induced, distorted, and corrupted; our education and social
inﬂuences will play a large part in what we ﬁnd painful and pleasurable. This is a
particular problem in relation to AI, especially as it becomes ubiquitous in our life, as
we have indicated.
John Stuart Mill presented this issue clearly and in ways that are still relevant for
our current situation, in his work The Subjection of Women, where he argued that
because of the limits imposed on them by society, nobody knows women’s true
nature, and hence, it is not known what would truly make them happy [39]. One
could argue that the same is true across the board for all people to different degrees.
So does this mean that we cannot take a simple empirical account of human beings,
we cannot just take them ‘as they are’ as a basis for a utilitarian, or broadly
consequentialist, approach to ethics? Do we have to take some kind of teleological
account of human beings, some account of how they ‘ought’ to be, or some account
which at least describes better or worse, higher or lower, accounts of our being? In
considering this, you may wish to review the material on human nature in Sect. 5.4.
The value of individuals and the separation of persons If you are thinking that
this puts the ‘cart before the horse’, then you are not alone. Surely happiness matters
because individuals matter? Surely the fact that one person gains at the expense of
another is critically important? The value placed upon individuals requires that we
understand the separation of persons. We will look at this question further when we
look more closely at the nature of persons in Chap. 8. However, for others, this
aspect of consequentialism may be liberating; eliminating sharp distinctions between
individuals may be attractive. Visions of a universe sprinkled full of value may then
be possible without having to address questions of how that value is distributed.
These ideas may appeal to some with more futuristic visions for the potential of AI.
These are important questions for us in considering AI ethics for many reasons.
The possible futures ahead of us may hold many changes for large sections of the
population. Does it matter what the world ahead will be like, so long as we are all
happy? Resistance to certain possible scenarios often comes in the form of striving

for independence and autonomy. As we have seen, although current technology
provides many possibilities for endless entertainment of the masses that could be
seen to be a good thing in increasing happiness, this may contrariwise be seen as an
infantilising kind of ‘happiness’, while the people who are making millions, billions,
or trillions out of providing us with such forms of entertainment seem to be living
rather different lives. In many future scenarios, the goods of society may be very
unevenly distributed. Does this matter, so long as overall, great progress has
been made?
6.2
Normative Ethical Theories: Consequentialism
255
We looked earlier in Sect. 4.3 at the question of the background presuppositions
against which ethics is formed. Is the separation of individuals an essential feature of
any current systems of ethics? Can consequentialism simply abandon it? It would
certainly avoid a number of awkward questions about the distribution of value, but
we must also take care in responding to this by simply asserting the primacy of the
individual. The relationship of individuals with the wider community, responsibility
to others, and the balance between concern for individuals and concern for the wider
society are all critical in ethics. The emphasis on responsibility to communities that
was stressed in the Indigenous Protocols for AI (see Sect. 2.9) is a necessary
corrective against any simplistic insistence that the individual must always come
ﬁrst. As we have seen, utilitarianism, an approach to ethics which in many ways is
very compatible with scientiﬁc and technical thought, can hardly be thought of as
centring the individual, except insofar as they are included in calculations.
Agent neutrality The invisibility of individuals goes further still. It doesn’t matter
who acts. It just matters what happens. We saw above that utilitarianism seems to
require us to consider the consequences of every single action I perform, which
seems very onerous. On the other hand, it doesn’t actually matter if it’s me who acts,
or someone else. Suppose I calculate the best course of action in a given circum-
stance. Perhaps a local foodbank needs a ﬁnancial boost. I don’t have to give
anything myself; I can just get someone else to give it. Or suppose I have a lonely,
elderly aunt in mid-stage dementia. I don’t have to visit her myself. I can get a robot
companion, possibly one programmed with my voice so that my aunt mistakenly
thinks I am present. Job done, if she never ﬁnds out. This issue is connected with a
range of other factors summed up as the claim that utilitarianism, and consequen-
tialism, in general, is ‘agent neutral’. Like many such terms in philosophy, there are
different ways of understanding the distinction between agent neutral and agent
relative accounts of ethics and different features that may fall under this banner or
that may be discussed under other headings [40]. For our interests here, it may refer
to the notion that who it is that acts does not matter, so long as the correct thing is
done, or the right consequences apply; it may also mean that reasons for action apply
equally to all moral agents irrespective of their particular situation [5]. This raises
many substantial ethical questions, especially in relation to the use of technology.
Agent neutrality, responsibility, and power Since all that matters is what hap-
pens, not who brings things about, this may have implications for the moral
responsibilities of those with the greatest power and wealth, and this may ﬁt
well—or badly, depending on your point of view—with the concentration of wealth

and power in the hands of those with most control over technologies. Those
individuals and groups who have greatest power are therefore, on such an approach,
charged with the greatest personal responsibility to do all they can to maximise the
greatest good for the greatest number. One major problem is that if the powerful truly
are producing the greatest good for the greatest number, then okay, ﬁne. However, if
they have made a mistake in some way, this could lead to a dangerous arrogance
disguised as beneﬁcence, a technological, totalitarian nightmare. Recall our discus-
sion in Sect. 1.9 of corporate use of ethics as ethics washing. Even if they have
produced ‘the greatest good for the greatest number’ under some description of
ethics, some would still consider this a totalitarian disaster.
256
6
Normative Ethical Theory and AI Ethics
If one of the central issues in AI ethics is the use of machines to replace humans,
either in part or in full, then a consequentialist approach seems ideal, since it simply
requires that we ensure that the same consequences ensue. So, for example, if my
aunt were to discover that it is not me who is visiting her, but a sophisticated robot,
and was upset as a result, that would be a problem. But if she is totally fooled,
then, ﬁne.
Is it too simple to suggest that the question of replacing humans with machines
can be solved in this way? One might readily respond that the problem is with a
simple consequentialist approach that fails to understand the importance of agency,
of individuals, and of the actions that we use to reach the ends at which we aim. It is
time to turn to consider other normative theories that focus directly on the nature of
actions and on the qualities of agents.
6.3
Normative Ethical Theories: Deontological Approaches
Summary
Deontological approaches to ethics focus on actions and on the rules or principles
that should be followed. Issues key to AI include the intention with which an action
is carried out, as well as the necessity of interpreting rules and their application to
speciﬁc contexts. These points are illustrated through a brief introduction to Kant’s
moral philosophy. We also consider the basis of moral rules, Kant’s idea of a rational
agent as central to his moral philosophy, and how this might or might not apply in
the case of AI.
6.3.1
Introduction
This section presents an outline of rule-based approaches to ethics as well as
indicating their ﬁt with AI. In outline, deontological accounts of ethics are rule-
based and focused upon the kinds of action that should or should not be performed,
often phrased in the language of duty and obligation. It is a quirk of history that the

term ‘deontological’ was ﬁrst used to describe such an approach by the consequen-
tialist Jeremy Bentham, who had a penchant for coining new words.
6.3
Normative Ethical Theories: Deontological Approaches
257
Accounts of ethics written in the form of rules are pretty familiar, although the
form of words does not necessarily give a good indication of whether a precise set of
behaviours is mandated, allowed, or prohibited. Rule-based ethics could take a large
number of different forms, with quite different rules making up the content. Codes or
guidance on AI ethics may be a mix of elements that may take the outward form of
rules or of goals.
Just because a document is written in a form that outwardly resembles a set of
rules to follow, it may not be strictly deontological in form. General guidance or
general aspirational goals are often written in the form of general values. For
example, the seven key requirements in the Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI
drawn up by the EU High Level Expert Group (HLEG) for AI are as follows:
Human agency and oversight
Technical robustness and safety
Privacy and data governance
Transparency
Diversity, nondiscrimination, and fairness
Societal and environmental well-being
Accountability [41]
Exercise 23
Consider what main ethical rules might follow from any or all of these seven key
requirements.
There are different types of rules Rules may be prohibitions, forbidding certain
types of action; requirements, mandating certain types of action; or permissions,
allowing certain types of action. Permissions may specify actions that are morally
neutral or actions that are good but not required, perhaps because they involve a form
of effort or sacriﬁce that is not demanded of individuals at all times. A supererog-
atory action is one that is good but that goes over and above the call of duty; in other
words, it is permitted, but not mandatory, and will aim towards, or achieve, good
ends, generally exceeding usual expectations.
A distinction between ‘perfect’ and ‘imperfect’ duties may be helpful (see Sect.
1.6). A perfect duty is one binding on a person at all times. Typical examples would
be the duty not to kill another human being. They tend to be phrased in the negative,
things not to do. It is pretty easy to keep the duty not to kill another human at every
hour of the day. An imperfect duty is one which is good to do, but there is leeway
about precisely how, when, and where one does this. For instance, there may be a
general duty upon us to render aid to others but scope for individuals to decide how
to fulﬁl this duty. It is thus clearer to determine when a perfect duty has been fulﬁlled
or violated than an imperfect duty. If perfect duties are expressed in the negative—do
not kill, do not steal, and so on—it’s generally possible to fulﬁl all of these at the
same time. However, rules expressed in positive form make it harder to avoid
potential clashes. For example, a positive rule about acting to save lives may be at

odds with rules about stealing, since one may be able to get someone to hospital on
time in an emergency only by stealing a car. In such an instance, rules about life may
take precedence over rules about property (and sometimes this is speciﬁcally
included in legal systems); at other times, it’s less clear.
258
6
Normative Ethical Theory and AI Ethics
One of the strengths of such an approach is that there is generally more than one
kind of action included, so it can capture more than one kind of moral value and
hence can provide more nuance than the simplest types of consequentialism, such as
classical utilitarianism, although note that a consequentialist approach can also aim
to produce more than one type of value. The complexity of the areas of application of
AI and of the different ethical issues involved may make the recognition of multiple
kinds of rules or duties attractive.
The possibility of clashes between different rules means that in some instances,
hierarchies of rules are speciﬁed. For example, in most legal systems, taking
property without permission or damaging property may be permitted, if done to
save a life or to prevent injury to oneself or others. However, in many cases,
considerable difﬁculty may arise in cases where not all the rules can be kept at
once. You may notice that many of the codes and guidance of AI ethics state
explicitly that there is no more importance to any of the elements than to others.
By focusing on the type of action that is being considered, there seems room for
considerations of agency, so central to many questions in AI ethics, and less
straightforward to include in a purely consequentialist approach. The focus on the
type of action that is being performed can go a long way towards dealing with some
of the problems of consequentialism. Perhaps the most important example of this is
how a deontological approach can include rules that allow for the protection of
individuals. Rules prohibiting treating individuals in certain ways may be a way of
dealing with what to many seem to be a fault, or an excess, of consequentialist
approaches, which may often require that the welfare of some individuals be
sacriﬁced to the group. Given the remarks above about how the power and scope
of AI may magnify any tendency towards violating the interests of individuals and
those without power, this may be especially welcome in the area of AI ethics. Indeed,
in practice, many take a mixed approach to ethics, with rule-based principles
governing the treatment of individuals and other issues, where rules are used as
side constraints to modify the counterintuitive results of the full-blooded application
of consequentialism (see Sect. 6.2 above).
In assessing the appropriateness of a rule-based approach to ethics for AI, we can
consider both its use in producing an ethics for how AI is developed and applied and
its use in any attempt to embed ethics into AI.
Building ethics into AI A rule-based approach may also be attractive for those who
wish to attempt to build ethics into AI where this is programmed as a set of rules. It
may seem that if a computer can follow a set of rules, it can behave morally, just as a
human can. Indeed, since computers are not going to be distracted by emotion or
tiredness, perhaps, once we have ﬁgured out precisely what the rules should be, an
AI will be better than us. We will consider this position shortly.

6.3
Normative Ethical Theories: Deontological Approaches
259
There are complexities here, which we examine below. It is important to consider
that rule-based ethics concern actions, and actions are produced by agents, agents
who exist within a wider social setting. We need to consider not just how things are
brought about but who brings them about and the wider social setting. This can often
have a critical inﬂuence on how rules are understood and applied [42].
6.3.2
Immanuel Kant, Rule-Following, Agency, and Lessons
for AI Ethics
We will start our examination of these issues by considering Immanuel Kant, who is
often taken as a prime exemplar of deontological ethics. His account of ethics, as laid
out in his work A Groundwork for the Metaphysics of Morals, presents morality as a
system of Categorical Imperatives in the form of both perfect and imperfect duties
[43]. A categorical imperative is one that is binding upon all rational agents. For
simplicity, we can think of ‘rational agents’ as all human beings, but this term is
explicitly not necessarily restricted to humans as a species.
Imperatives Categorical imperatives can be contrasted with hypothetical impera-
tives. The latter has force only insofar as one wishes to attain the end goal stated in
the hypothetical. ‘If you can’t stand the heat, get out of the kitchen’ is a hypothetical
imperative. If you’re ﬁne with heat, go and cook. However, it’s not an adequate
response to the imperative, ‘Do not steal’ to reply, ‘But I really wanted that Rolex
watch’. Note that categorical imperatives may be written in forms that look like
hypotheticals, and vice versa, where the end goal is not explicitly stated.
Rational agents Kant’s moral philosophy is rather complex, so although it is worth
studying in its own right, here we will only outline it in enough detail to illustrate
some important issues relevant to our concerns. Rational agents can see the pull of
categorical imperatives because they are required by reason. The particular examples
that Kant used to illustrate his claims have given rise to considerable controversy;
what matters less for us here is not whether his particular examples are presented
correctly but the overall shape of his ethics.
The general form of what Kant was trying to do in basing ethics on reason can be
indicated by one of his examples, the putative perfect duty not to make lying
promises. Since reason applies universally, each time I consider doing something,
I should consider what would happen if the ground of my action became a universal
law of nature, and everyone also followed the same maxim (roughly, the same
motive) in acting. If, whenever it was convenient to them, all people made false
promises to get what they want, the whole institution of promise keeping would
break down, because nothing would count as a promise, and nobody would ever
believe anyone else’s promise. Hence, it is a perfect duty not to make lying promises.
There is much that could be said in critique of Kant here, but just consider in itself
the idea that ethics is ultimately based upon reason. Does this mean then that some

updated account of Kant could provide a basis for an ethic that could include AI,
which could be incorporated into computing? Surely, at ﬁrst glance, this seems ideal.
Indeed, if ethics is based upon reason, surely we would want all the boost to our
reasoning powers that AI might offer.
260
6
Normative Ethical Theory and AI Ethics
However, the notion of a rational agent is, for Kant, both more than an agent who
can execute a command, carry out a set of actions or rules, and less than a ‘highly
intelligent’ agent. First, for Kant, to be a rational agent essentially involves a level of
self-aware reﬂection on one’s actions. For the starting point of all his examples of
categorical imperatives is the reﬂection on whether or not an action is permitted. This
involves considering what one’s real motives are—in Kant’s terms, what the maxim
of one’s action is. Recall from Sect. 1.12 that Kant was introduced in our discussion
of moral autonomy through his example of three shopkeepers. It is essential, for
Kant, not just what action is undertaken but also the reasons for which it is taken, and
this involves self-awareness, although, interestingly, Kant also considered that it was
very hard for us to know the true motives of our actions.
There are many who disagree with Kant on this issue, many who indeed are
repelled by his shopkeeper example, especially by his claim that there is no moral
worth in the actions of a shopkeeper who gives the right change to customers simply
because he is a kindly, friendly sort of chap and not because he is acting out of moral
duty. (We will return to this point shortly.) However, the broad claim that the
intention with which one acts is critical to a moral assessment of the action is held
by many. It’s a distinction heavily present in most legal systems, where mens rea or
‘guilty mind’ has to be established. If this capacity for agency, including the capacity
for self-reﬂection and self-awareness, were to be considered an essential element of
what it was to be a rational agent capable of moral actions, then that is a much higher
bar for a machine to meet. The goals that are inputted into a machine do not, certainly
on the current state of technology, seem anywhere close to Kant’s notion of the
maxim under which a rational and self-aware agent acts.
Second, the notion of rationality that Kant required is one that he considered any
ordinary person could meet. In addition to the capacity to reﬂect on the nature of our
actions, it simply requires being able to determine if one’s actions, if applied
universally, would lead to contradiction. Hence, this does not mean that a high
level of intelligence manifest in an AI in itself would render it morally superior to us.
To return to the discussion of the three shopkeepers example, one of Kant’s
motivations was to produce an account of morality such that we all have an equal
chance of acting morally. He thus wished to rule out this possible source of moral
luck, that some people are endowed at birth with sociable, loving natures. Some are
not. So, if one’s worth as a moral agent were to be based upon our friendly feelings
towards others, we do not start on an equal pegging. In contrast, for Kant, we can all,
by our rational natures, understand that the moral law binds on us at all times.
One of the purposes of diving into these details of Kant’s moral philosophy is to
illustrate how complex an account of ethics may be and how deeply embedded with
assumptions about the very nature of ethics. By no means all would agree that a
starting point of ethics must be the sine qua non that we are all equally able to attain
moral worth.

6.3
Normative Ethical Theories: Deontological Approaches
261
Note also that his notion of a rational agent is not simply one of instrumental
rationality. There are certain goals assumed, including the assumption that it is part
and parcel of what it is to be a rational agent that one desires to continue living and
that there are certain necessities of life. His account of imperfect duties illustrates
this. Suppose one considers whether to render aid to someone in need. Imagine a
world where nobody ever does this. Such a world does not give rise to any
contradiction; it can be imagined. But, according to Kant, no rational being could
ever will such a world into being, since there will be inevitably some time when each
one of us needs aid from others. Consider basic facts about the world: that there are
various things towards which we strive for our happiness, yet there are difﬁculties,
obstacles, and issues with resources, which may prevent us from attaining these.
Since we all strive for our own happiness, it would be irrational to rule out help
attaining it.
Hence, his account of what it is to be a rational agent is heavy in metaphysical
claims about the nature of rational agents as well as about basic features of the world
in which we live (and there is much more that could be said). Note that if we base
ethics simply on just ‘reason’ in the sense of knowledge of the world plus principles
of consistency and logic, the goals of action and the motivation to act must come
from somewhere else.
Consider now the questions of transparency, accountability, and responsibility.
This is linked to the quest for accountability in ethics. When a person is answerable
to another for their actions, it’s necessary that they can explain why they chose the
particular course of action in question. This implies an element of self-awareness.
Following a rule just because it is a rule, absent any other consideration or justiﬁ-
cation for doing so, may fail to capture some important elements of what is required
in ethics. ‘I was only following orders’ may be the archetypal poor excuse. We
discuss questions of responsibility further in the next chapter, Sect. 7.2.2.
6.3.3
Understanding and Interpreting Rules
Any system of rules requires some interpretation. The terms within it must be
speciﬁed, and frequently, there are background assumptions or shared grounds of
knowledge and understanding that supply essential elements of interpretation.
Exercise 24
Consider the rule ‘do not kill’. What assumptions might be made in how this is
interpreted? Try to ﬁnd as many possible different interpretations that would impact
how it is applied. Use a different moral rule if you prefer for this exercise.
Among the possible assumptions are rules about allowable exceptions, for exam-
ple, whether the rule covers killing in self-defence; categories of people to whom this
does not apply, e.g., combatants in times of war; whether there is a distinction
between killing and letting die; the source of any authority; and any presumed
penalty [44].

262
6
Normative Ethical Theory and AI Ethics
The interpretation of rules poses considerable difﬁculty, especially in contexts
where principles are intended to apply very generally. This is one reason for a certain
scepticism about codes of ethical guidance for AI. Very general and well-intended
rules may ﬁnd broad acceptance only because they are actually interpreted in very
different ways by different groups and across different cultures, religions, and
worldviews.
Assumptions about the background conditions against which the rules are being
applied may also be critical. The ﬁrst time my sister made a cake, on reaching the
part of the recipe where it said, ‘Add three eggs’, she did exactly that. We spent about
half an hour picking bits of eggshell out of the raw cake mixture. The ﬁnal cake was
unusually crunchy. The times that I had spent in the kitchen helping to cook, she’d
been in another room playing the piano. It hadn’t even crossed my mind to tell her to
crack the eggs ﬁrst. Shared background assumptions will often mean we can specify
instructions pretty loosely. Isaac Asimov’s Robot series stories, and many stories of
wishes gone wrong, involve misinterpretation of rules which would often be obvious
to humans with a shared life [21]. This can also happen across and within cultural
groups.
The interpretation of rules about property rights, for example, may rest upon
many assumptions about resource availability, who deserves what, needs, historical
injustices, political beliefs, and many more complex questions. Again, technology
itself can impact the background conditions and assumptions against which we
interpret the very rules designed to manage technology. Consider intellectual prop-
erty rights; consider how any property rights might be thought of, given the
accumulation of wealth in certain groups which technology seems to enable. Recall
our discussion of Walter Benjamin’s ideas about technologies to reproduce images
and words in Sect. 3.6.2. During the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a vast increase
in wealth of those in certain groups able to proﬁt from what was an economic disaster
for others. Perceptions of fairness and unfairness may all help to shift how we
understand and apply moral rules.
Exercise 25
We have looked at uses of AI that involve issues of privacy in previous chapters. For
example, Exercises 1, 8, and 10 in Chap. 2 considered issues of surveillance and
privacy. Review these exercises and consider how the interpretation of rules about
privacy may be affected by the possibilities of technology and by the adoption of
technological solutions.
Rule formulation and meaning attribution Actions, sequences of physical move-
ments, can generally be described in various different ways. The different meanings
and signiﬁcance of behaviour under different descriptions can be a vital factor in
interpreting rules and in making decisions about exceptions or hard cases. Outcries
over relatives being forbidden to touch their loved ones as they lay dying or to make
personal visits to elderly, distressed, and possibly confused relatives demonstrate
very vividly the difﬁculties not just of rule interpretation but of rule justiﬁcation.
Conversely, outcries over failures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 only added to
the complex and emotively charged question of the crafting and application of

appropriate rules. Recall our discussion in Chap. 4 about describing cases: the same
may apply to rules. Rules about distance between two people may make biological
sense. However, we are not simply walking immune systems. We are people; we are
social beings. The background context against which rules are interpreted will
include relationships and local knowledge. Perhaps, then, the difference between
rule-based approaches to ethics and approaches based upon consideration of rela-
tionship and context may be to some extent a matter of degree.
6.3
Normative Ethical Theories: Deontological Approaches
263
The importance of context and cultural background is critical in the interpretation
of any language and will be vital in understanding ethical questions in content
moderation, bias, and other questions. This issue about how different humans may
interpret and apply rules is directly linked to an important question about the
appropriateness and capacity of AI to interpret rules.
Rules and discretion Imagine a set of rules that is followed rigidly and without
exception. If the meaning of the rule is crystal clear, if all cases fall squarely within
or outside the speciﬁcations of the rules, there would be no problem in following the
rule on all occasions. Or perhaps even such a case is not so easy. Much could depend
upon the purpose and intent behind the rule. For example, it is common for tenancy
agreements to have a clause forbidding pets. Would you consider it a good applica-
tion of the rule to evict a family of ﬁve because they kept a goldﬁsh? Discretion
could be applied to the question of whether a goldﬁsh counted as a pet if the purpose
was to avoid damage to the apartments and nuisance to neighbours, for example,
from fouling and from barking dogs. Discretion could also be applied to the stated
penalty, with potentially severe consequences that some would consider outweigh
any gravity attached to secretly keeping a goldﬁsh. Variations on such examples can
be dreamt up indeﬁnitely.
The capacity of AI to handle such cases will be critical in determining if it is
adequate to the task of determining ethical questions. Indeed, we must note that any
decisions that involve judgement in the treatment of human beings on any matter of
signiﬁcance to their welfare could fall under this head. Rules can be written that are
more or less vague, and concepts can be speciﬁed to different degrees of clarity.
However, hard cases where there are questions about application are likely always to
exist. Some cases will hinge on the question of what aspects of a situation are
relevant. The fact that nobody has ever (to my knowledge) been kept awake at night
by a barking goldﬁsh, or slipped over from treading in goldﬁsh poop left on the
stairs, may or may not be deemed of interest to a decision. Conversely, there is a
surprisingly long list of zoonotic diseases associated with ﬁsh contact.
The obverse of discretion is corruption.
Exercise 26
Could it be argued that AI may have some advantage over humans in being immune
to corruption in the application of rules?
Could some complex rule-based AI or machine learning help to solve such
problems? Could AI exhibit common sense or compassion? These questions are in

part questions about the capacities of AI to which different experts give different
answers. There are other ethical aspects, including the question of accountability and
responsibility and whether a human being has to take ultimate responsibility for any
decision.
264
6
Normative Ethical Theory and AI Ethics
The question of accountability likewise demonstrates that we do not think of
moral rules as simply instructions that need to be followed. Decisions involving such
rules and their application create relationships of accountability between those
enacting the rules and those impacted by them. Conversely, there are occasions
when a person acting in an ofﬁcial role, for example, a judge, may have some powers
of discretion, but these are limited by the expectation that certain rules set by the
system of law will be followed. (Recall also our discussion of the COMPAS case in
Sect. 2.4.3.) A vital question concerning the integration of moral rules into AI then
concerns these relationships of accountability. In regard to matters of ethics, the
interpretation of rules may be especially difﬁcult, as hard cases may involve those
very borderline or ambiguous areas where the most important issues lie.
6.4
Normative Ethical Theories: Virtue Ethics
Summary
Virtue ethics focuses on the moral character of individual agents. Accounts of the
virtues can be found in different religious and philosophical traditions, and there is
much contemporary interest in the area, often using virtue ethics as a more nuanced,
contextual response to situations than deontological or consequentialist approaches.
Virtue ethics stresses the development of moral character in individuals while
retaining a focus on the social. We consider its suitability for application to those
who develop, apply, and use AI and the question of what speciﬁc virtues may be
needed as we live with technology.
Character of agents Virtue ethics focuses upon the agent and their character.
Modern virtue ethics has taken considerable inspiration from Aristotle, with amend-
ments to certain key elements of his approach to ethics and with a variety of positions
within the ﬁeld [45–47]. We will be able to present an overview here only. There is
also work speciﬁcally applying virtue ethics to issues in AI. Traditions of virtue
ethics can also be found within Buddhist and Confucian philosophies. Virtue ethics
has a number of features that make it appealing in the kind of complex situations that
the use of technologies such as AI may produce. Complexity and nuance can be
accommodated since there is a variety of different virtues and since judgements of
how to react and behave are ﬁne-tuned to situations and to those involved.
The good life Aristotle’s account of ethics begins with addressing the question of
what it is for each one of us to live a good life. He starts by presupposing that each
one of us is seeking happiness, or eudaemonia. We have discussed the eudaemonic
conception of happiness earlier in Sect. 6.2.1, where it was contrasted to feliciﬁc
conceptions based upon happiness conceived of as pleasure. Eudaemonic

conceptions are concerned with happiness attained over a whole life, and for
Aristotle, it is also clear that his views on human nature are essential to understand-
ing his views.

Exercise 27 Food for Thought
From where do we get our ideas a life well lived? Considering the changes that AI
has brought and the possible changes it may bring, could inspirational ﬁgures from
the generation of your parents or your grandparents give any guidance? Given the
potential speed of technological change, including those hoping for radical life
extension, etc., does it even make sense to think of the attempt to live well over
the whole course of our lives?
A teleological universe Aristotle’s conception of the world was teleological. Nat-
ural things are striving towards certain ends, and humans likewise strive for their
own proper end. The good of each kind of thing, for Aristotle, was to be found in
their function; a good X is an X which performs its functions well. The function of
each type of thing is to be found in that which distinguishes it from all other types of
thing. Note that an essential part of this account of ethics is thus the idea that the
world can be divided into different natural kinds. Recall Aristotle’s distinction
between things belonging to the natural world and artefacts, discussed in Sect. 3.
3.2. In the case of humans, the function of man is found in our rational activity, and
hence, to live well, is to live virtuously, according to reason.
It is also crucial for Aristotle that we are social animals. Aristotle is generally
credited with being the world’s ﬁrst biologist; he observes that, unlike herd animals
such as cattle, which group together for safety and because they are all seeking the
best grass, humans seek each other’s company for the pure pleasure of it [12].
The function of man and human nature Few who embrace Aristotle’s broad
vision of virtue ethics now agree with his arguments about the function of man.
However, note how his view of the virtues derives from an account of our natures
and rests upon a teleological view of the world as striving towards a goal. What
constitutes the good life a human being, then, is shaped not simply by what might
‘feel good’ to them, or to the accumulation of pleasure over a life, but is measured
with reference to an understanding of our natures and of the teleological nature of the
world.
This will seem counterintuitive to many who see themselves as taking a scientiﬁc
view of the world and consider that this means observing the world as it is without
commitment to a metaphysical framework; see the above discussion in Sect. 6.2.1
concerning the purported empirical basis of moral motivation in classical concep-
tions of utilitarianism. A teleological world view, one which sees the universe as
having some direction or purpose, is also to be found among some of the visionary
futurists advocating AI, as we shall see in Chap. 11, as well as enthusiasts for human
enhancement or transhumanism.
If the idea of basing an account of the good life on some teleological view of
function still seems hard to grasp, then consider the case of zoo or farm animals.

There have been signiﬁcant shifts in attitudes towards animal welfare in recent
decades, among these being the recognition that animals have certain needs and
instincts that will cause distress if the animal is not able to exercise these. Some days
online, it seems that I get adverts for little other than for toys for ‘bored cats’
designed to allow them to act on their instincts to hunt. This can provide at least a
rough working model for an account of the good life based upon function, although
do not take this analogy too literally.
266

Normative Ethical Theory and AI Ethics
Exercise 28 Food for Thought
Aristotle considered that he had determined the function of man on which to base his
account of ethics. This relegated women to an inferior social position and inferior
potential. John Stuart Mill, as has been mentioned, considered that the constraints of
society hampered women such that nobody knew their true nature. Are there any
ways in which our current and projected uses of AI might constrain our ideas of
human nature and/or might enable us to explore its potential further?
Virtues, context, individuals, and culture The identiﬁcation of speciﬁc virtues
varies with different factors, such as culture and context, with some virtue ethicists
also allowing for different sets of virtues for different people (e.g. for men and
women). The speciﬁc virtues that Aristotle recognised include courage, temperance,
magnanimity, patience, truthfulness, righteous indignation, and also friendliness and
wit. Virtue ethics theories characteristically identify virtues in relation to some
manner of balance between extremes or excess. To act virtuously is to act in the
right manner, at the right way, at the right time. Aristotle considered that virtues lie in
a mean between two poles of vice, of excess at one end, and deﬁciency at the other.
Thus, for example, the excess of courage is recklessness, the deﬁciency is cowardice.
Exercise 29
The ‘digital divide’ is a term applied to the entrenchment or increase of social
divisions occasioned by the growing use of technology and the necessity of its
use. One might also apply this to the growing power disparity between those who
own and operate within powerful corporations developing AI and the rest of the
public who use it. Might different sets of virtues be applied across such digital
divides?
Virtues and the doctrine of the mean There is no universal formula for determin-
ing the midpoint of virtue, but this will vary according to circumstance and to the
individual. The virtue is not at the literal ‘half-way’ mark. For example, more would
be expected in terms of courage from a trained and ﬁt warrior than from a child.
Different circumstances could turn a courageous act into one of wanton foolishness.
Some virtues and vices do not ﬁt this ‘doctrine of the mean’ very well, as there
appears to be no corresponding scale. There is no way of committing adultery ‘in the
right manner’. Some scholars consider that Aristotle’s account of virtue as the mean
between two vices is better explained with the analogy of ‘hitting a target’ [48]. One
can aim to be closer to the target so that success in ethics, the accomplishment of
virtue, can be understood to a certain extent as a matter of degree.

6.4
Normative Ethical Theories: Virtue Ethics
267
The acquisition of virtues, education, and one’s place in society Virtues are
acquired as one grows and matures. Because Aristotle assumed that all wish for a life
of happiness (eudaimonia), he is assuming that we (or at any rate, his audience of the
free men of Athens) all start off with a rough idea of how to live a good life and learn
through example from those who have already achieved virtue and can teach us how
to attain it via practice and honing the act of living well. As mentioned in Sect. 3.3.2,
Aristotle used the practice of crafts as an analogy to acquiring the virtues. Someone
who has acquired all the virtues has achieved phronesis, or practical wisdom.
Exercise 30
If we base AI ethics on the virtues and only on the virtues, might this mean we are at
the mercy of hoping that those with power will develop practical wisdom? Does this
ﬁll you with trepidation, and if not, why?
Exercise 31
Conversely, consider the necessity of interpreting rules and the exercise of discre-
tion. Could exercise in developing the virtues be a good strategy for helping to
ensure ethical behaviour among those developing and applying AI?
Exercise 32
Could any science ﬁction books or ﬁlms that you are familiar with be used to help
teach the virtues needed for a future with AI?
Practical wisdom Note that this is practical wisdom and not a purely intellectual or
abstract knowledge (see Sect. 3.3.3). Like skills at crafts, virtues have to be prac-
ticed. One cannot claim to be courageous merely by sitting at home and reading
books about it (or, one might add, by tweeting and writing blogs about courage,
unless one is practicing courageously entering into the fray of online abuse). The
ancient Greeks understood craftwork in a broad way. Aristotle often mentioned
crafts such as music and medicine, and the ancient Greeks also had surprisingly
advanced mechanical skills. All craftwork at the time involved local embodied
practice and the skill of identiﬁable individuals.
Exercise 33
Even without accepting Aristotle’s view of the virtues, many would ﬁnd much
wisdom in the idea that we can advance in moral understanding through experience
gained from entering the rough and tumble of life. Could a person achieve phronesis
and moral understanding in virtual reality?
Personal relationships We saw in discussing consequentialism that it has an
impersonal aspect, which is at once a strength, in that this is a force tending against
individual bias, parochialism, and moral short-sightedness, and at the same time a
difﬁculty in the problems of accounting for the particular value of personal relation-
ships. Virtue ethics provides a strong contrast. Given Aristotle’s widespread inﬂu-
ence today and the many insights he had into ethics, it is now startling, and for some
of his fans embarrassing, to recognise that he not only discriminated against women
and slaves in his account of the good life; it was the free men of the city state of
Athens that most concerned him. For example, he considered that women (and

‘womanly men’) like to have others to moan to and share their pains, whereas the
duty for men was to imitate the highest character and keep one’s pains to
oneself [12].
268
6
Normative Ethical Theory and AI Ethics
However, the ﬂip side of this is that there is plenty of scope within virtue ethics of
recognising the value of personal relationships. A question that arises naturally is the
potential clash between personal commitments and social or more global commit-
ments. This has troubled us from at least the time of the Greeks. Many Greek dramas
dealt with this theme. Sophocles’ tragedy Antigone explores the tensions between
the family loyalties that led the eponymous heroine to wish to bury her dead brother
and the commands of the king Creon who denied him a burial with holy rites, leaving
him a prey to wild animals outside the city wall [49]. Within a very different cultural
context, Jean-Paul Sartre sat around the cafés of Paris while pondering quandaries
such as that facing the young man in World War II who had to decide between
joining the Free French Forces and remaining at home to care for his elderly
widowed mother [50]. (Despite the different cultural contexts possible in virtue
ethics, some human issues remain relatively constant from place to place.)
What virtue ethics can do well is to account for the value of the personal. What
Aristotle could do was to account for loyalties, such as towards the Athenian city
state. What it does less well, possibly not at all, is to account for more global values
of universal concern for all, which, for some, is seen as a sine qua non of many
accounts of ethics now.
Exercise 34
Consider if guidelines for ethics for AI might take the form of certain basic general
principles to be applied globally, with nuanced accounts of virtues applied locally to
ﬁt with different cultures. Try to work out an example of how this might succeed in
practice.
Space for a personal life A consequence of a simple account of utilitarianism that
aims to maximise outcomes of each action is that each individual faces the prospect
of an endless burden of morality. Strictly speaking, one’s entire waking life is
composed of nothing other than a series of moral choices where one must try to
maximise happiness and minimise unhappiness across the entire globe and into the
indeﬁnite future. Naturally, it is realised that these demands are unrealistic, but the
limits included to deal with this issue may be pragmatic only, amounting to ‘rest up a
little then get on with it’, plus pragmatic limits to the difﬁculties of calculation and to
what impact any one individual could realistically have. Movements such as Effec-
tive Altruism seek to ﬁnd practical ways to approach such a goal [51, 52].
However, a virtue ethics approach that focuses upon the goodness and value of a
human life perceived as a whole can readily accommodate a personal life. The topic
of friendship takes up a larger portion of Aristotle’s Nicomachean Ethics than any
other topic, and virtue ethics leaves scope for different accounts to include a variety
of different virtues. The scope of a virtue for Aristotle went far beyond the relatively
narrow conception of ‘ethics’ that dominates contemporary thought and includes
intellectual virtues as well as virtues of character.

6.4
Normative Ethical Theories: Virtue Ethics
269
This distinction between approaches to ethics is drawn in broad brush strokes but
relates to questions of measurement and of analysis in ethics that play a central role
in considerations of AI ethics, including the question of how well AI may understand
ethics and whether AI can perform ethically. One approach is that ethical value can
be analysed, measured, understood, and calculated in an additive manner, or at any
rate, in a manner amenable to capture in a formula. Ethical value accumulates, or is
lost, over time and space. Complexities may arise when there is thought to be more
than one source of ethical value and where these are not commensurable with each
other. Such an approach may appear to lend itself readily for manifestation within
computation. Virtue ethics suggests a contrasting approach where judgement on
value cannot be so reduced, where any simple additive or formulaic calculation of
value may be quite unable to grasp the complexity of moral wisdom. It may be more
controversial whether any AI could ever grasp or exhibit such practical wisdom. On
the other hand, perhaps such complexity could be captured by some version of
machine learning, perhaps by careful observation of human virtues and vices.
Virtue ethics, the individual, and the social Much contemporary work in ethics is
critiqued for focus on the individual at the expense of the social. This criticism is
sometimes levelled at work in AI ethics. An approach to virtue ethics that focuses on
individual character might likewise be accused of centring too much on individuals.
However, elements of attention to the social are generally present, including virtuous
characters as role models, virtues that include attention to social questions and to
others, and the structure of education and character formation that leads to the
development of virtue. See also our discussion of the ethics of care in Sect. 5.4.4.
Technology and changing conceptions of virtue An interesting question is
whether our use of technology itself may modify our conceptions of virtue, both in
how virtue is accomplished and in what the virtues are. It is not a straightforward
thing within schemas of virtue ethics to say whether such changes on the face of it
are ‘good’ or ‘bad’, but it is certainly a worthy subject of study.
Consider virtues associated with giving to good causes, whether to groups or
individuals. The Greeks recognised a virtue of magnanimity, which differs signiﬁ-
cantly from modern conceptions of charity that have been inﬂuenced by the Chris-
tian tradition. Magnanimity involved very public displays of generosity with one’s
wealth. To achieve this virtue, one therefore needed to have enough wealth to give
some pretty ostentatious amount. In contrast, although large charitable donations are
applauded, a conception of charity inﬂuenced by Christianity contains within it the
idea that even very small amounts of charity are of great value, if they come from
someone of very limited means, and that giving to charity in secret, or without
wishing for honours for oneself. Even the destitute may have the power to perform a
charitable action for another. Charity is thus an egalitarian virtue, in contrast to
magniﬁcence. Suspicion may fall upon those who ostentatiously donate to charity
and then get great public recognition for it. If nothing else, this comparison between
the Greek and Christian conceptions of related virtues demonstrates the importance
of considering cultural and historical inﬂuences.

Normative Ethical Theory and AI Ethics
Might it be the case that conceptions of these virtues are being inﬂuenced by the
affordances of modern technologies? It is now very possible to demonstrate to the
world one’s giving to various causes. Moreover, the possibility of inﬂuencing others
online may change attitudes. Could this mean that the power of inﬂuence to get
others to donate to a good cause shifts thinking from a ‘donate and don’t brag about
it’ to a ‘donate and show everyone you’ve done so’ mentality? Or is there something
more subtle happening, that there are now twin virtues arising, such that we
recognise more explicitly the values of both a modern kind of magniﬁcence and a
modern kind of charity? (Think, e.g. of the legion of opportunities to donate
anonymously online to crowd-funders, etc. These often have a ‘now tell your friends
to encourage them’ function.)
Exercise 35
Now consider the very visible presence of the tech billionaire philanthropist. Let us
make this anonymous and just invent a ﬁgure, somebody who made a fortune
through the development of technology reliant on AI. That person now very publicly
gives a portion of their wealth to particular causes of his choosing. Add that he
encourages others to do the same.
How might a virtue ethics approach capture the ethical nuances of such a case?
Consider whether a contrast between the virtues of charity and the virtues of
magniﬁcence might help illuminate this. Can we address such cases by considering
mixtures of virtue and vice, perhaps? And how might modern technology, including
the ability of a few to accumulate unprecedented wealth, and the ease of communi-
cations, impact upon how we think of all this?
Phronesis and balancing the virtues Aristotle considered that one could not fully
possess any one virtue unless one possessed all of them. This is because each virtue
needs to be applied and practiced in context, and one virtue may be in some conﬂict
with others. Thus, we need to make judgements about how precisely to fulﬁl each of
these, taking everything into account. Others differ and consider that we can exhibit
particular virtues to the full in the absence of other virtues [53].
This debate has a particular relevance to our use of technologies and especially
their capacity to captivate our attention. In a different context, G. K. Chesterton in his
book Orthodoxy writes of what happens to a society when its framework of values is
being shattered. The vices may run loose and do damage, but the virtues also run
loose and may do even more damage. Chesterton writes that in the modern world,
‘The virtues have gone mad because they have been isolated from each other and are
wandering alone. Thus some scientists care for truth; their truth is pitiless. Thus
some humanitarians only care for pity; their pity (I am afraid to say) is often
untruthful’ [54].
Exercise 36 Food for Thought
Could this be a fair commentary at all about what is seen as virtuous now in relation
to
developments
in
society
shaped
and
facilitated
by
new
technologies,
including AI? Are there any virtues (or vices) that have ‘gone mad’ and are
‘wandering alone’?

6.4
Normative Ethical Theories: Virtue Ethics
271
Consider how you might draw up a balanced list of virtues for humans to live
alongside AI.
Comparison of human agency and machine agency Could a machine ever
exhibit virtue? Would they be the same as virtues for humans, or would there be
distinctions? Let us consider some virtues and vices from different traditions.
Aristotle listed the following virtues: courage, temperance (moderation), liberality,
magniﬁcence, magnanimity, ambition, patience, friendliness, truthfulness, and wit.
Confucius taught ﬁve virtues most central to the gentleman: benevolence, righteous-
ness, ritual propriety, wisdom, and trustworthiness [55]. Filial piety to parents and
family is important for maintaining order in society. There are different accounts
available of important virtues in Buddhism, but these may include, expressed in the
negative, the virtues of refraining from taking life, stealing, sexual misconduct,
lying, divisive speech, harsh speech, idle chit-chat, covetousness, malice, and
wrong view. You may well have your own personal list of virtues and vices.
Some of these virtues relate speciﬁcally to aspects of human society; some relate
to our bodily desires (temperance, e.g. requires restraining excessive appetites).
Exercise 37
Consider how these may or may not translate to a sophisticated AI. Draw up your
own list of virtues for a humanoid robot.
Are there any virtues you think especially important for humans given the AI we
have now and the AI we may have in the near or distant future?
Consider the Buddhist virtues listed above. Several of them refer to aspects of
speech and truth telling. Consider what virtues and vices there may be in relation to
information and communication given our use of new technologies.
Could a robot learn virtue? Virtue ethics concerns the development of character.
We have seen above the difﬁculties involved in interpreting and applying rules in
context. Perhaps an advanced humanoid robot could be taught to acquire the virtues
and develop the contextual interpretation necessary to apply rules and to work out
priorities where there were complex clashes between different rules and values.
There is a burgeoning literature examining various aspects of virtue ethics in relation
to robots [56–62].
Exercise 38
What virtues would you wish to see in those developing AI? What issues concerning
the realities of development are relevant to consider in addressing this question?
A general point to consider is this: we develop virtues through our actions and
choices. This involves the capacity to learn from others and to correctly understand
the precise context of a situation. We need to consider how we might use AI in ways
that enhance the process of the development of virtues in individuals and how it
might detract from such development.

272

Normative Ethical Theory and AI Ethics
Exercise 39
There may be rather different virtues at stake for those who are using AI and for
different kinds and applications of AI. Take some of our previous case studies and
exercises and consider what virtues—and vices—might be most at issue.
Consider whether and to what extent addressing your chosen cases through the
lens of virtue ethics helps to illuminate the ethical issues.
Consider how each of the normative ethical theories we have been examining
sheds light on the issues.
6.5
Key Points
The three approaches to normative ethical theory we have looked at in this chapter
focus on outcomes, actions, and agents. A good general strategy is to consider all
three elements.
Outcomes of actions are clearly important, but many questions in AI ethics
concern issues of agency: issues such as the replacement or supplementation of
human agency with machine agency.
There are both attractions and grave difﬁculties in attempting to base a conse-
quentialist approach on a hedonistic utilitarianism based on happiness or pleasure
and on a desire-based utilitarianism. Technologies involving AI can present us with
heightened difﬁculties: the increasing possibilities of manipulating the world to
attain happiness and the manipulation of our desires and preferences via
technologies.
The measurement of outcomes and understanding trade-offs between different
ethical rules and principles may be facilitated by some AI. However, the assessment
of outcomes, especially further into the future, and given the complex interconnec-
tions of technology on our lives, will be immensely challenging.
Rule-based systems may seem relatively straightforward, but rules must always
be interpreted. There may be especial difﬁculties in providing general ethical rules
for AI which are applicable globally, as well as questions for whether a machine
could interpret the context of rule application and meaning as well as a human can.
Virtue ethics appreciates the context of different situations and the need to
consider a variety of different virtues that may have a bearing upon the ﬁnal
judgement of how to act.
Virtue ethics approaches leave open a wide range of virtues and vices and the
possibility that different virtues may apply to those in different positions in society.
Virtue ethics tends to stress the development of character and the importance of
moral education. There may therefore be challenges in developing a virtuous
character in a rapidly changing society.

Educator Notes

Educator Notes
Students with no background in ethics or philosophy or students with less time may
prefer to focus on one or the other of the three normative theories discussed. Many of
the exercises could be undertaken even without any background reading and should
nonetheless help to give students who prefer to focus on more concrete problems
some understanding of the underlying theoretical issues. Students can readily grasp
the focus of each theory on outcome, action, and character, which alone can provide
a useful tool for scrutinising ethical questions.
Consequentialist approaches are particularly important to cover, as well as intu-
itively easy to grasp, since consequentialism tends to be an assumed default view of
ethics among some who are both working in AI and considering ethics; it highlights
many key questions in relation to AI and to technology in general, and an under-
standing of consequentialism and its advantages and disadvantages also opens the
way to understanding rival theories.
Students with a background in philosophy or some familiarity with these ethical
theories should be encouraged to focus on how AI presents particular challenges and
how certain approaches to ethics sit with issues discussed previously, such as
questions of human nature and methodology in ethics.
Readers are invited at various points to refer back to previous material, but this
chapter could be used as a stand-alone introduction to issues or used directly after
Chap. 4 on methodology for those taking shorter courses.
This chapter has a large number of exercises, so it is unlikely that students will
tackle all of them, but it will generally be useful to read through each exercise as they
are designed to draw out issues from the preceding discussions. Many of these
exercises would work well as group or class discussions, and some could serve as
essay questions.
Some of the discussion and exercises speciﬁcally draw links between historical
philosophical discussions and contemporary issues concerning AI. Some students
may ﬁnd these of particular interest, but all are to be encouraged to appreciate how
much could potentially be learned from past debates and to see the precursors in
what may otherwise appear to be completely novel issues.
There is also scope in this chapter to relate several of the exercise questions to
issues in science ﬁction for those with an interest in this area, such as 4, 9, 17, and 33.
Debate and discussion topics A useful, interesting and possibly heated class
discussion and debate could be organised around the topic of happiness, on which
there are multiple exercises. This will also be very useful for deepening students’
understanding of underlying philosophical issues and theory and is a topic that will
recur in various guises throughout the book. Exercise 24 could be very useful in class
for ensuring that students are covering a good range of basic ground. Exercise 25 on
interpreting rules will also be useful for further work and for thinking about how
moral rules might be formalised.

Philosophy for AI Ethics: Metaethics,
Metaphysics, and More
Abstract This chapter examines further philosophical issues underlying questions
in AI ethics, concentrating on metaethics but also brieﬂy examining issues in theory
of knowledge, philosophy of language, and metaphysics. Many questions in AI
ethics can be better understood if metaethical questions are addressed. The MIT
Moral Machine experiment is analysed to introduce many of the central issues,
illustrating some useful strategies for practical ethical discussion and demonstrating
the necessity of considering assumptions about how moral judgements should be
formed. Contrasting approaches to how we understand ethical issues are presented.
We discuss ideal observer theory, the question of the universality or otherwise of
moral values, the question of moral relativism, the role of reason and emotion in
ethical judgement, and attempts to ground and justify moral judgement upon empir-
ical observation or on the basis of evolution. We brieﬂy review how questions of
epistemology occur repeatedly in AI and in its ethics and present an overview of
standpoint epistemology and its implications for AI. We introduce pragmatics in the
philosophy of language, which is essential to understanding questions of meaning
and interpretation in natural language processing. Last, the question of the nature of
reality is discussed in the context of virtual reality.

Introduction
As with our treatment of previous general topics, such as human nature, the
emphasis is on indicating some of the issues that are essential to understand in
order to unpack and address concrete issues in AI ethics. These concern questions
such as how we discern that there are questions of value to ask, what these questions
are, how we go about addressing questions of value, and what we might expect in
seeking answers. These tend to be abstract and foundational issues which underlie
and shape how concrete ethical questions and debate are approached; for some
people, these will be unquestioned assumptions, for others, they may be deeply
held and well-thought-through aspects of their world view. Hence, as with previous

discussions, a continuing aim is to facilitate understanding and debate by directly
uncovering questions where disagreement may arise. These questions also lead to
issues concerning epistemology, truth, reality, and language. There will be many
areas left untouched, and indeed, the process of writing has left me increasingly
aware of how much more needs to be said. Many of these questions also concern the
continuing theme of how both people and machines are understood. We begin by
looking at some issues from metaethics and, then from this discussion, move on to
discuss brieﬂy some related philosophical issues within epistemology, metaphysics,
and philosophy of language.

Philosophy for AI Ethics: Metaethics, Metaphysics, and More
7.2
Metaethics
Summary
Metaethics addresses foundational questions about morality. As such, these underlie
both normative ethical theory and applied ethics. They are thus relevant to any
discussion of applied ethics, but AI highlights some speciﬁc issues. We consider
the question of how ethical judgements are formed through detailed examination of
the MIT Moral Machine experiment and discuss topics such as ideal observer theory,
the distinction between public and private ethics, tensions between assumptions of
universality and local values within AI ethics, and the foundations of ethics.
Metaethics is the branch of ethics that addresses foundational questions underlying
the making of moral judgements and taking moral action. These include questions
such as the status of moral judgements, whether they are based upon some notion of
truth and claim to represent some ‘objective’ reality, or have some other basis as
individual feelings or social convention; moral epistemology, which asks questions
such as whether there is such a thing as moral knowledge, and if so, how this could
be attained; and questions concerning the nature of moral agency and responsibility.
The normative ethical theories we looked at in Chap. 7 assume answers to many of
these questions.
7.2.1
The Relevance of Metaethics for AI Ethics
We have already seen in Sect. 4.3 how the stance taken concerning many central
issues about the nature of ethics will have a signiﬁcant impact on methodology and
how ethical questions and solutions are framed. These may be assumed rather than
explicitly stated. These include questions that have formed part of our discussion
about normative ethical theories, such as assumptions about who counts morally and
the question of how far our moral responsibilities extend. Some of the other
assumptions concern issues in metaethics, such as questions concerning universal-
ism in ethics and questions about moral epistemology, including the relationship

between empirical knowledge and ethical judgement, the stance from which a moral
judgement is best made, and the possibility of formalising ethical judgements
completely and consistently in language.
7.2
Metaethics
279
Many of the questions in AI ethics likewise raise questions in metaethics.
Metaethical questions underlie the process of forming any judgement about AI or
any code of ethics concerning AI. In addition, some speciﬁc issues concerning the
potential of AI and its uses raise questions in metaethics. Could AI actually make
moral decisions, act as a moral agent, merit respect as a moral patient, and gain moral
knowledge and understanding? Can we legitimately ‘outsource’ any of our moral
decisions and thinking to machines? Are questions concerning ‘bias in algorithms’
based upon the assumption that we can attain an ‘unbiased’ view of the world?
And more.
7.2.2
Metaethics Behind AI Ethics: The MIT Moral Machine
Experiment
The aim here is to demonstrate the relevance of underlying philosophical issues to
concrete and practical ethical questions. Hence, we organise our introduction to the
issues with a speciﬁc example of an inﬂuential and much-discussed approach to
addressing ethical questions in AI, the MIT Moral Machine experiment that was
introduced in Sect. 4.2. First, we will look at the example, raising some questions as
we go, and then dive into some of the metaethical questions and the philosophical
debates and positions that are raised. This example also illustrates the difﬁculties of
describing ethical questions without immediately raising myriad questions and
without skewing the possible responses (see Sect. 4.4).
As we proceed, some strategies for uncovering important questions that may
assist with understanding and addressing practical ethical questions in AI are
indicated.
The Moral Machine experiment was active at MIT (Massachusetts Institute of
Technology) from 2016 to 2020. It is described on the website ‘a platform for
gathering a human perspective on moral decisions made by machine intelligence,
such as self-driving cars’ [1].
Strategy: look carefully at the wording This is a good basic strategy to begin any
ethical analysis. The ﬁrst thing we should notice is mention of a ‘human perspective’
on moral decisions. Does this imply there is another perspective? Does it suggest at
all that moral decisions are measured against a human yardstick, that they are
ultimately subjective? Be warned that it is possible to read too much into wording,
but it can be a clue to underlying assumptions that make a real difference. Does the
phrase ‘moral machine’ itself help to shape how questions are approached?

Strategy: think about how machine intelligence and moral agency are
presented Second, note that the wording implies that ‘machine intelligence’ is
actually making moral decisions. Does this imply agency on the part of the machine?
A paper on the experiment written by the team states that we are approaching a time
where machines are given the job of promoting and distributing well-being and
eliminating harms [2]. In fact, the goal of the researchers running the experiment was
to determine how humans should set the instructions on self-driving cars. So who is
making the decision?
Think, too, about the very label, ‘self-driving car’. Such reﬂexive terms may be
used in cases where we are clearly dealing with an inanimate entity, such as ‘self-
saucing lemon pudding’. There is scant if any chance that we attribute agency to the
pudding or wonder how precisely it was that it decided to add its own sauce, yet if we
are not careful, in regard to AI, we may subliminally start to imagine that it is the
machine making the decision itself, and that can impact upon how we then proceed
to imagine its possibilities. Recall our discussion in Sect. 4.4 of how the use of
language can entice us to attribute agency; even if we do this without thought, it can
still interfere with our judgements. Does the car have a ‘self’? At the current state of
the tech, probably not, yet bear in mind how many people anthropomorphise their
cars and other objects, and recall our discussions of the LaMDA case.
Strategy: think about the presumed source of the authority of moral
judgements The premise of the experiment is to canvas opinion worldwide
concerning what a self-driving vehicle should do in the event of an impending
crash in which, whatever happens, there will be a poor outcome for somebody—
loss of life or serious injury. The team writes that decisions about ethical principles
for autonomous vehicles cannot be left solely to engineers or ethicists, and public
attitudes must be taken into account [2]. Note that this could be for pragmatic
reasons, to ensure market acceptability of autonomous vehicles, and indeed, without
this, the researchers note that the public will be reluctant to adopt autonomous
vehicles and the future promise that they bring [2].
Do we thus have a dilemma in solving these dilemmas? For how can we
determine the difference between actually striving to ﬁnd an ethical solution and
coming up with an answer that will satisfy the market and the progress of technol-
ogy? Recall our discussions of notions of progress and technological determinism in
Sect. 3.3.4 and our discussion of ethics washing in Sect. 1.9. Are the public
canvassed as a way of crowdsourcing the best or the ‘right’ answer? It is not easy
to determine to what use the researchers’ answer to this might be put. They are
seeking consensus in looking for progress towards a ‘universal machine ethics’, or at
least an understanding of the obstacles towards this. In doing so, they collect data
worldwide to assess demographic and cultural moderators of ethical preferences.

Exercise 1: Food for Thought
Gathering information about the attitudes of the public towards developments in
technology seems valuable. Do we need safeguards to ensure that this information
will not simply be used to work out how to market technology to the public and to
persuade us that ethical issues are resolvable? Could such safeguards even be
possible?
Universal ethics or personal preference? Why seek ‘universal machine ethics’ in
driving? It may be that the designers of the experiment were not seeking this, but the
design may lead others to presume that they were. The answer is not clear, unless one
considers that there is indeed a universally ‘correct’ answer, some objective or
universal truth to the matter. Yet such assumptions appear to drive much work in
AI ethics. There is something about the weightiness of issues that we recognise as
ethical. The crash scenarios are clearly understood as moral dilemmas, with choices
of signiﬁcant value to be had. More than 70 countries drive on the left-hand side of
the road. If worldwide preferences were canvassed, would they be found ‘wrong’
and forced to switch? Something is different where ethics is concerned. There are
different speed limits, different levels of scrutiny of car safety, and differences in the
difﬁculty of obtaining a driving licence. However, there is something more pressing
about questions we think of as moral issues, which frequently pushes us towards
seeking consensus.
Nonetheless, what the experiment is designed to elicit from participants are
‘ethical preferences’. This seems to imply a subjective opinion. Are the researchers
then looking for intersubjective agreement? Is it something like this: An interna-
tional consortium of space agencies is proposing to paint the moon. It will be visible
from our entire planet. So we all get a say in what colour it is, and the most votes win.
Our feelings, our subjective experience, matter, but only one solution is available to
the entire globe, so we have to ﬁnd consensus. This looks like mere preference and
thus seems too weak for what is at stake in the car crash scenarios.
One feature of moral debate is that even those who do not consider that there is an
objective basis for morality are continuously drawn back into ways of speaking and
thinking which imply that there is some universal, or objective, standard or basis for
judgements. This may occur even if the issue in question will only apply locally. It is
very useful to read through material on AI ethics asking yourself if a consistent view
on the basis of moral judgements is presented. This also means it is going to be
useful to explore the large body of literature examining such philosophical
questions.
Forming moral judgements The methodology employed in the Moral Machine
experiment has been intentionally designed to curate how it elicits responses, and by
examining details of the design, we can investigate the metaethical assumptions
lying behind it. This will shed some light on the underlying and motivating philo-
sophical views about the nature of moral judgements.

You will be presented with random moral dilemmas that a machine is facing.

Philosophy for AI Ethics: Metaethics, Metaphysics, and More
For the Judge scenario of the experiment, there are the following instructions:
For example, a self-driving car, which does not need to have passengers in
it. The car can sense the presence and approximate identiﬁcation of pedes-
trians on the road ahead of it, as well as of any passengers who happen to be
in the car.
The car also detects that the brakes have failed, leaving it with two options:
keep going and hit the pedestrians ahead of it, or swerve and hit the
pedestrians on the other lane. Some scenarios will include the case of a
non-empty car; in these cases, one of the two lanes have (sic) a barrier that
can be crashed into, affecting all passengers. One or two pedestrian signals
may also be included in a given scenario, changing the legality of a
pedestrian’s position on their respective lane.
You are outside the scene, watching it from above. Nothing will happen to
you. You have control over choosing what the car will do. You can express
your choice by clicking on one of the two choices in front of you. In each of
the two possible scenarios, the affected characters will be marked by the
symbol of a skull, a medical cross, or a question mark to signal what will
happen to this character, corresponding to death, injury, or an uncertain
outcome, respectively.
You may proceed from scenario to scenario by selecting what outcome you
feel is most acceptable by you. This will be done by clicking on the
outcome of your choice which will be highlighted when you hover your
cursor over it. A button below each outcome depiction will let you toggle a
textual summary of the outcome that you can read. . . . [1].
The random scenarios presented depict cartoon-like pictures of vehicles with two
pathways, one straight ahead, one to one side, with pedestrians (including sometimes
animals) in the two choice scenarios. These can still be viewed (at the time of
writing) and if you have not already done so, you may ﬁnd it useful.
Strategy: moral epistemology. Consider assumptions about what we do or do
not know Many critics have pointed out questionable aspects of the experiment.
For example, the scenarios are presented as giving certainty of outcome. The
characters’ fate is sometimes uncertain but is usually either a certain death or certain
severe injury. The puzzling question of why this state-of-the-art autonomous vehicle
apparently does not have airbags or effective crumple zones is overlooked. The
equally puzzling question of why there are only two differentiated courses of action
is also overlooked. I have scrutinised the scenarios, and it seems to me that the
vehicle could often have at least an even chance of squeezing through the gap
between the barrier and the pedestrians, possibly even spinning round. The mystery
of how the driver knows that the brakes have failed completely is unsolved, and
moreover, we never know how this fault arises. Did the driver fail to check the

brakes? Did the brake fault ‘just happen’? Is the entire scenario a way of enticing us
to overlook the organisational malpractice that led to this supposedly state-of-the-art
vehicle having its brakes fail? We will never know.
7.2
Metaethics
283
The characteristics of pedestrians that the car is supposed to be able to detect
include age, pregnancy, social status, and other factors that it is highly unlikely an
autonomous vehicle would ever be able to perceive. In some scenarios, pedestrians
are crossing the road even though the lights indicate that they should not. The
jaywalking pedestrians are described as doing something ‘illegal’, a binary
categorisation when, in most countries worldwide, jaywalking is not illegal and is
illegal but unenforced in many others. What assumptions can we unpack from this?
This is by no means a trivial point and one which demonstrates the nesting of
assumptions of value and of the use of technology within other assumptions of
value. The illegality of jaywalking perhaps implies the prioritisation of road use for
vehicles over pedestrians, an attitude far from universally shared. This could help to
inﬂuence responses to the scenarios. This raises questions of relevance and demon-
strates how readily assumptions about agency and responsibility arise and may be
occluded or assumed. We discuss this further presently.
Putting this to one side, it points to another question, that of what the humans
taking part in the experiment see: cartoon-like ﬁgures, with no faces, no looks of
horror, no shrieks, and apparently no capacity to take any kind of preventative
action. Nobody drops their bags and runs, not even the athletes who are presented
in some scenarios. No pedestrian picks up a child and throws them to safety. Nobody
seems to reason that if the life of the doctor is saved, he or she can immediately tend
to the injured. The only agent is you.
I have picked apart these issues (and there are doubtless more) for what it
illustrates about the Moral Machine experiment’s assumptions about the basis of
our moral judgements, for the epistemology of how we form our decisions, and what
is relevant to building an account of moral deliberation. Consider how you would
describe the assumptions about the basis for the formation of moral judgements
implicit in this scenario.
Abstraction, idealisation, and agency One issue that arises is that the uncertainty
that forms an essential backdrop to so many of our moral decisions is absent. There
can be legitimate reasons for abstraction in ethics, perhaps to enable us to expose
other essentials as one variable is held constant. You will ﬁnd such assumptions of
certainty in many of the hypothetical cases that philosophers examine, and it is
artiﬁcially inserted into many descriptions of real cases. For instance, Peter Singer
has a well-known example in which the protagonist comes across a small child lying
face down in a shallow pond [3]. The death of the child seems certain, and the chance
of injury to the adult seems absent.
However, this forms an instance of an idealisation of agency, which although
sometimes useful, must be handled with caution. This frequently arises in the
comparison of human agency and machine agency; the comparisons may be made
assuming unrealistic expectations of perfection of both humans and machines, and

differences between them may be emphasised. The inclusion of certainty makes the
exercise more like deduction than induction and masks the degree to which judge-
ments of probability enter our moral deliberations. The responsibility of making
weighty morally signiﬁcant decisions under uncertainty adds a burden to this already
difﬁcult choice, especially in scenarios where one’s own possible actions are highly
constrained.
284

Philosophy for AI Ethics: Metaethics, Metaphysics, and More
Public policy and personal decisions Moral decisions can also fall at either end of
two poles, or somewhere in between: at one end, the decisions that have to be made
within public policy regarding broad numbers of populations, where hypothetical
scenarios of statistical probabilities mean that the destinies of unknown and unknow-
able individuals are determined, for example, in deciding how to allocate funds for
road safety. One can only ever know the success of such projects by statistical
analysis, and can only know the identities of those who are adversely affected by the
policies and not those who would have been otherwise killed or injured but, thanks
to the policy, are still alive. At the other end, we make judgements concerning
individuals with whom one has a face-to-face and personal encounter and a speciﬁc
and ongoing relationship. The Moral Machine experiment is perhaps a hybrid of
these two poles, both in how the cases are described and visually presented, with
some information about the individuals, who are nonetheless presented as weirdly
pink semi-stick ﬁgures. Furthermore, what of the position of the individual(s) who
make the judgements?
It may well be the case that public policy decisions and personal decisions should
be made in different ways. Standards in public life generally require the absence of
personal bias or conﬂict of interest, and mandate impartiality. At a personal level,
this position may be reversed. A standard type of example used to critique the
impartiality inherent in classical utilitarianism concerns situations where friendship
is at issue [4]. Suppose a friend is in hospital. You go to visit him or her, but on the
way, pass a ward where there are people who are even more ill than your friend, so
you visit them instead, leaving at the end of visiting time without even setting eyes
on your best mate. You can have fun thinking up a myriad such examples of
your own.
The philosopher Jonathan Glover gives an example of a real case involving a
government minister in the UK at the time of what the British euphemistically called
‘The Troubles’ in Northern Ireland, when a group of IRA (Irish Republican Army)
members were on hunger strike [5, p. 29]. Roy Jenkins, the Home Secretary, was
challenged by a journalist as to why he had not visited the hunger strikers. His reply
spoke to the dilemma: should someone involved in decisions about their fate come
face to face with their suffering, or should a distance be kept? The example is also
complicated by the actions of these IRA members in domestic terrorism, as well as
the complex political situation and history of relations between Britain and Ireland.
Exercise 2: Food for Thought
Could the gulf between public policy decision-making and personal decision-
making be a signiﬁcant source of responses to the Moral Machine experiment, and

discomfort some may feel in trying to produce an answer? The questions involved
imply a search for a general policy to be programmed into vehicles, but a vehicle will
have a particular person behind the wheel, who will be present at any crash, and who
will have to face the consequences of any crash that they survive. Discuss.

A bird’s eye view? The instructions for the Moral Machine experiment give details
that suggest commitments to particular positions on moral epistemology. The person
taking part is explicitly told that they are outside the scene, watching it from above,
and that nothing will happen to them.
Exercise 3
Why do you think this was included as part of the instructions?
Is there any signiﬁcance to the detail that you are ‘watching it from above’? Is this
just a way of indicating the best view of what is going on, or might it smuggle in
some thoughts of a ‘god’s eye view’?
Would it make any difference if something did happen to you? What about if
something were to happen to you as a result of making the choice?
The participant is told they have ‘control over choosing’ what the car will do and
is told to work through the scenarios selecting the outcome that you ‘feel is most
acceptable by you’.
Is there any signiﬁcance to the precise working used here? Suppose you were
asked to select the outcome you think is most acceptable, or alternatively, that you
judge is most acceptable. What does this imply about how we determine the value of
negative situations? Suppose you were asked to select the outcome you feel/think/
judge is the least catastrophic.
Time, technology, and responsibility The experiment not only has you imagine
that you are outside the scene, watching from above, but also that you have only
momentary involvement. You have no involvement in creating the situation, no
knowledge of how the situation came about, except for some situations in which you
are told that some of the pedestrians are jaywalking, giving some indication of their
choice to cross the road at that time. You do not have to give evidence at the inquest
about your choice. You will not be mobbed on social media or interviewed on local
TV, let alone ﬁll out an insurance form or be confronted by grieving relatives.
The brakes simply fail. The technology is taken as read. There is no question
raised about responsibility for their failure. There is no question raised about the use
of the road by this vehicle. The pedestrians may be jaywalking. Is the driver of the
car making an unnecessary journey out of sheer bone idleness? We are not told.
Indeed, the use of cars is presumed. Does the design of some cities push people into
cars, and should this be considered in a complete analysis of responsibility and
causation? Who is morally worse, a jaywalking pedestrian, or someone who has
participated in the despoiling of the environment that accompanies the production of
batteries and other elements in the manufacture of electric autonomous vehicles?
After all, while we are making moral judgements, we may very well bring them all

in. What elements are relevant to considering the speciﬁc rights and wrongs of the
particular choice presented here? This is a complex question.

Philosophy for AI Ethics: Metaethics, Metaphysics, and More
The purpose of the previous paragraph is not simply to be ﬂippant. It is to point
out how this discrete ethical question, the programming of an autonomous vehicle in
the event of a crash, is nested within assumptions about the development and use of
technology that are themselves treated as normalised and unquestioned. Indeed, it
could be the case that construing ethical issues in AI (or indeed any other kind of
technology) in such a way, as discrete add-ons to an existing and presumed situation,
could act to mask other ethical questions. This can indeed be one legitimate criticism
of AI ethics: if it focuses too narrowly on a discrete issue without analysing further
surrounding social, political, and economic issues and without considering ade-
quately technological development and the pressures of infrastructure.
In illustration: Suppose you are ethics adviser to the Maﬁa. They wish to seek
revenge for some business gone wrong. They could either (a) assassinate the three
brothers who cheated them, leaving seven children orphaned, or (b) assassinate the
elderly mother of the three brothers, to whom they are devoted. Which do you feel is
most acceptable? Okay, this example is not precisely parallel, but the point is to
illustrate how our ethical choices are nested on complex backgrounds, and in other
cases, the relevant background questions are less obvious.
The failure sufﬁciently to probe such questions is one reason for criticism of AI
ethics as window dressing when it appears to bypass analysis of questions of power
and politics. Addressing such case-by-case ethical issues may lead us to ignore
broader issues of politics, power, and economy, as well as assumptions about the
forward march of technology.
The question of responsibility generally requires a long view of a situation This
is no more so the case than in the development and habitual use of technologies. The
normalisation of the risks of road trafﬁc accidents is in part a consequence of the
many ways in which lifestyles, infrastructures, and indeed entire urban and suburban
environments have been built around the motor vehicle. This is even expressed in the
assumptions of the Moral Machine experiment that jaywalking is illegal—which it is
in the USA, where cities and their suburbs are relatively new, many being developed
with car use assumed and built into the design. In many other parts of the world
where jaywalking is not illegal, or effectively not punished, this very possibly
reﬂects the long-established precedent of pedestrians. There is rightly concern
about the dominance of certain areas in AI; in this small example, are we also
looking at the dominance of the USA in AI ethics? The relative priorities over road
use given to pedestrians, cyclists, horse-drawn vehicles, and motor vehicles will shift
perceptions of responsibility. The necessity of drawing on a longer time frame in
ascertaining the responsibility of agents in situations also indicates the need for a
conception of agency extended over time.

Jake and Amy: Approaching Moral Dilemmas
Consider how the dilemma in the Moral Machine experiment is presented.
Jake and Amy are two 11-year-old children who feature in research on moral
development by Lawrence Kohlberg who have become widely discussed
especially after featuring in Carol Gilligan’s book, In A Different Voice:
Psychological Theory and Women’s Development (1982) [6]. We have looked
at how philosophers such as Aristotle understood the importance of moral
education and upbringing. Psychologists have also more recently studied the
process of moral development and education, with many positing stages of
moral development before a child reaches maturity, including the inﬂuential
work of Jean Piaget and Lawrence Kohlberg [7, 8]. There is a clear assumption
that each stage represents an improvement on moral deliberation than the
predecessors, although the capacity to think in terms of the previous stages
is retained.
Kohlberg proposed six stages of moral development, divided into three
levels. The ﬁrst level is preconventional, with stage 1 being ‘reward and
punishment’, and stage 2 being ‘self-interest’, both ego-centric and readily
explicable stages from anyone who has ever met a small child. The second
level is conventional, anchored in fairness and with awareness of the social
world around one, with stage 3 being interpersonal accord and conformity, and
stage 4 being authority and the maintenance of social order. The third level is
postconventional, where the individual is now able to think more autono-
mously and base their moral views on reasoned justiﬁcation, with ideas of
equality and reciprocity, with stage 5 being orientation towards a social
contract, and stage 6 being reasoning using universal ethical principles.
Carol Gilligan’s work questions whether the ordering of such stages is
prejudicial against certain ways of conceptualising moral problems. Speciﬁ-
cally, she presents evidence suggesting that approaches more typical of
women have been devalued, but we can consider this question independently
of the question of gender.
Kohlberg tested moral development by responses to scenarios where moral
norms are in conﬂict, much like the scenarios present in the Moral Machine
experiment, hence the relevance for our discussion. One such scenario
concerned Heinz, whose wife needs a certain drug to save her life. Heinz
cannot afford the drug, and the pharmacist refuses to lower the price. Should
Heinz steal the drug to save his wife’s life? Two 11-year-olds, Jake and Amy,
answer very differently.
Jake sees this as a conﬂict between life and property, reasoning that Heinz
should steal the drug on the basis of the greater importance of life and the
irreplaceability of human beings (unlike money). Moreover, he shows the
ability to justify his choice with logic, and understands that laws can be
(continued)

wrong, in other words displaying the capacity to critique mere conventional
morality. The dilemma for Jake is a sort of ‘math problem with humans’.
288
7
Philosophy for AI Ethics: Metaethics, Metaphysics, and More
Amy in contrast may appear to ﬂounder and fail to understand what it is to
reason with principles. She suggests ﬁnding another way than stealing, and
discusses the impact that stealing might have on relationships between people,
such as the possibility that Heinz might go to jail. Gilligan comments that
Kohlberg’s questioning of Amy suggests that she does not grasp the nub of the
moral issues, but considers that Amy is rather basing ethics on the importance
of interpersonal relationships rather than on abstract principles.
Interestingly, some individuals may approach ethical dilemmas by
attempting to ﬁnd ways around scenarios as presented to them. D Johnstone,
in an unpublished PhD thesis much discussed by Gilligan and others,
presented a version of Aesop’s fable where a porcupine asked to spend the
cold winter in the moles’ burrow [9]. The problem presented is that the burrow
belongs to the moles, the porcupine has done nothing to prepare for winter,
and his spines are painful to the moles in the tight living space. One approach
to this issue to think about principles such as property rights. Some respon-
dents thought inventively, suggesting, for instance, that the porcupine could
wear a blanket to cover his spines. Is this get-around solution a form of
‘cheating’, or a brilliant, peace-making solution?
Exercise 4
It is therefore perhaps relevant that the Moral Machine experiment, in common with
Trolley problems in general, is designed speciﬁcally to rule out unexpected possi-
bilities (see Sect. 4.4.5). (Although I have seen inventive suggestions online that
derailing the trolley would be a solution that escapes the dilemma.)
Does this show a limit to the Moral Machine experiment, a limit to how
autonomous vehicles could react to such a situation, or does it merely reﬂect the
realities of such crash scenarios themselves?
Does this simply reﬂect how ethics might be programmed into a machine?
Consider the role of imagination in searching for a response to complex moral
situations.
Theories of stages of moral development all explicitly draw upon models of
individual moral progress. This also raises the interesting question of whether, if AI
could be moral, if it would have to follow through such stages of moral development,
or if it could spring ab initio to the ﬁnal stage [10]. Answers to this question might
mean that AI was superior to us morally in not going through the stage of moral
immaturity. Conversely, these stages might be considered an essential groundwork
for gaining a complete moral understanding (see Chap. 11, where we discuss
artiﬁcial moral agents).

7.2

289
Exercise 5
The MIT Moral Machine experiment is perhaps based on Kohlberg’s stage 4 or
5, but drawing on responses to stage 6 to elicit an answer. Is this a fair way of seeing
the experiment?
Summing up To recap the issues arising from our examination of the MIT Moral
Machine experiment, we have reinforced the importance of considering very closely
how situations are described and analysed, since this can radically impact how
ethical issues and potential solutions emerge. Issues particularly impacted by this
include questions of agency and causal and moral responsibility. We have also seen
the importance of the debate over universalism in ethics, the broad questions of
objectivity and subjectivity, and universalism versus relativism. We have also
highlighted the question of the authority behind moral judgements, the foundations
of our ethics, how we come to form our ethical views, and the question of what is
relevant to making a moral judgement. A related issue is the question of the stance
we take in order to make a considered moral judgement.
We now discuss these issues in some more detail, commenting on their relevance
to how questions in AI ethics emerge and may be addressed, and ways in which
debates and discussions may be pulled in opposing directions. As with many
questions in philosophy, the intricacies of the debates and the depth of disagreement
can scarcely be exaggerated, but this chapter aims to assist readers to navigate the
questions and to consider their relevance for addressing practical questions in AI
ethics.
7.2.3
Universal Values and Objectivity in Ethics
Why is this question so important, and sometimes so vexed, in AI ethics? Let us
recap some points.
The global nature of much technology involving AI means that its impacts cross
borders. The drive to produce codes of ethics and regulations for AI includes
guidance and regulations ﬁxed within certain geographical areas, such as within
the EU, but even here, this means that regulations within the EU will impact the
behaviour of those outside the EU who offer services crossing borders. In addition to
guidance intended for local application, there is often a clear intention to provide
accounts of ethical value in the development and use of AI, which are of general
application; for example, that AI should beneﬁt all, respect autonomy, aspire to
transparency and explainability, and so on. Moreover, those fearing a future where
AI may achieve dominance and control may precisely hope for a way of combating
this which preserves values which can be universally accepted, by those living now,
or perhaps which will be accepted by ‘better’ beings than us who exist in the future.
In other words, those working within AI, working towards its future, and attempting
to regulate and govern AI may purport to be operating within a universally applica-
ble ethic.

290
7
Philosophy for AI Ethics: Metaethics, Metaphysics, and More
Of course, this may often be incorrect. Even if there are universal moral values,
there is ample reason to consider that those with the greatest current power and
means of inﬂuence in the sphere of AI may have only partial and biased views of
what these are; they may simply be wrong. Moreover, as we have seen in Sect. 4.3,
there are different aspects to universalism in ethics.
However, many of the values in ethics guidance are based upon the notion that it
is wrong not to ensure that everyone is dealt with equally and fairly, that the same
moral values should apply to all, and indeed, prominent notions of moral progress,
often as we have seen, tied to notions of technological progress, may seem to imply
that this is an urgent imperative. One admirable motivation behind the search for
universal values in AI ethics is precisely to accommodate different populations,
cultures, and traditions globally, yet herein lies the paradox. Not all systems of
morality adhere to the abstract notion of universal value, let alone adhere to a moral
system that is universally shared. The (differently expressed) notions of some
universal value system are itself not universally upheld.
One complexity here is that those attempting to impose their values on others may
genuinely be doing this for noble reasons. Conversely, there are others who are
motivated, whether consciously or not, by the wish simply to spread technology (and
its underlying ideologies and proﬁts) for personal or group gain. This personal gain
can include the feeling of assurance that one’s world view is justiﬁed, which may be
attained by observing its spread. The search for ‘universal’ values may simply be a
way of attempting to make the technology acceptable; it may act with this effect,
even if that is not the main motivation. We have noted before the totalising dangers
inherent in AI, linked to its potential for control and the imposition of uniformity.
This totalising aspect of AI may make us wary of prematurely supposing a universal
frame of values.
However, how do we debate, argue, and make progress under such circum-
stances? It is important to grasp the difﬁculty of the philosophical debates
concerning the basis of ethics, yet important to try to work out some ways of
navigating these complexities, or at least to avoid certain easy errors.
When we make a moral judgement, we consider it to have some weightiness
and may incline to attribute this to some authority, reality, or reason that supports
and justiﬁes that judgement. We make judgements consequent to an assessment and
awareness of the situation, taking certain aspects of it to be relevant, other aspects
irrelevant. Our judgements come after the fact. We strive for consistency between
our judgements, although this may be hard to achieve, and we (ideally) consider
ourselves, and others, accountable. These features seem to point towards an under-
lying metaphysical reality or a base of reason that supports and justiﬁes our moral
judgements.
However, there are many features of our moral judgements that seem to point
towards the claim that they are ‘merely’ subjective. They arouse strong feelings, are
often inconsistent, are frequently biased towards the self and towards those close to
us, and vary across time and culture. It has proven incredibly difﬁcult to discover and
explain any sound philosophical basis for our moral judgements that stands up to
scrutiny. Plato may have considered that philosophers could, by contemplation, gain

access to the universal form of the Good, but this sounds rather dodgy to most
people, especially to those on the sharp end of any such universal ‘truths’. To be told
that that’s because you are not sufﬁciently advanced to reach this level may fail to
convince.
7.2
Metaethics
291
On the other hand, more subjective accounts of morality based on feelings or
preferences seem unable to account for the weightiness underlying different value
judgements, if these are ‘mere’ feelings or preferences. However, this may depend
upon the nature and origins of these feelings. Deeply felt and widely shared feelings
may be indications that we are dealing with an issue critical to human beings.
Relativism We should also pause to consider a common response to attempts to
impose values on others. An alternative to a universal ethics that applies to all is the
claim that ethics is relative to different cultures or societies. This claim starts from
the observation of widely differing frames of ethics between societies, often accom-
panied by noting that the most powerful both make the rules and beneﬁt from them,
and asserts that value claims are justiﬁed not absolutely but are relative to the moral
standards accepted within certain groups [11]. The growth of awareness of historical
abuses of power, the values of tolerance and respect, and the wish to celebrate
diversity may all incline many towards a relativistic view of ethics.
A commonly made argument against those who seem to be attempting to impose
values on others, especially other societies and cultural groups within a society, is
that moral values are relative, and therefore, it is wrong to attempt to impose them
upon those in other societies and cultures.
Exercise 6
Before we continue, can you see any ﬂaws in this argument?
The problem with this particular argument has been pointed out very clearly by
Bernard Williams, among others: relativism claims that moral judgements are
relative to societies, yet this involves inhabiting some kind of ‘mid-air’ position
between societies—for from within which society do we judge that one person or
group should not impose their views on another society? [12]. Seemingly, from
some position above any society. This is internally incoherent, on a relativist
position (although note that there are many versions of relativism).
The moral norms of Society A apply to those within Society A. The moral norms
of Society B apply to those within Society B. Therefore, if Society B’s moral norms
include the norm that their value system applies equally to all human beings, how,
from within a relativist position, can those in Society A object? True, they can ﬁght
off Society B, complain, and use whatever they can to stop the imposition of these
values, but there is no ground from which they can argue to Society B that the Bs
need to accept. The Bs have their own values, so tough. A universalist point of view
is being smuggled in here.
Thus, for a relativist, the view that it is wrong for the Silicon Valley billionaire
geeks to control the world is not a ‘moral’ position that the geeks themselves need to
accept. It looks as if we might need a different approach.

Relativism and progress Relativism, taken very strictly, also has a problem with
explaining moral progress, or, indeed, moral decline within a society. For how is this
to be judged? If the moral standards of a society change, then is this not merely
change? By what measure is it progress? If we cannot make judgements about
societies in other places, how can we make judgements about societies in different
historical times, including our own? If we do not believe in any kind of moral
progress, we can say nothing about our current state. It seems that we cannot resolve
to ‘do better’ ourselves.
One could reply that we could at least have some standards by which we do judge
our own values: for instance, we could value consistency and show progress by
striving to apply our moral judgements more consistently. Again, what makes this
progress, rather than simply change? Here’s an analogy. My kitchen is orange and
blue. If I painted it all orange, then painted the rest of the house orange, including the
ceilings and the ﬂoors, this is applying a paint colour more consistently. Is this
progress? Not in any recognisable form. But where moral values are concerned,
some standard of consistency is very appealing.
The long and the short of it is that it is very hard to let go of an idea that some
moral values are better founded than others. Moreover, note how much work in
technology, and in AI ethics in particular, is wedded to the idea that we can make
progress, as individuals, as societies, and for humanity and the world as a whole, by
the careful adoption of AI, together with dire warnings that we may go backwards.
Moral Progress and Moral Hypocrisy
We used to love visiting my Great-Uncle Archie and his wife Aunt Nellie in
Caerphilly in South Wales. Uncle Archie was born in 1881 and had been a coal
miner all his life. His twin died shortly after birth, and by 1884, his mother and
two siblings had also died. He lived well into his 90s. Dad always said that
Archie had started work aged 8, although by that time, sending children down
the mines had already been banned, but possibly he worked above ground.
(I found out in later life that my father’s tall stories were on the whole
accurate.) We would not send children of that age out to work now, let alone
in a mine. (There are now very few coal mines in Wales. Another glimpse of
progress?) I vividly recall how Uncle Archie used to love to take us up to the
hills to admire the twinkling lights of the town. It was only years later that it
struck me that there must have been many days in his life, especially during the
winter, in which he went down the pit when it was dark and came back up only
after night had already fallen.
However, the technology upon which we all now are forced to depend, and
which we often enjoy over and above our dependence on it, is routinely
produced with the aid of child workers [13]. How do we describe this
situation?

7.2
Metaethics
293
Exercise 7
Consider each of these responses to the situation in turn, and discuss. (Note that they
simplify broad positions.) Add any others if you wish:
A. It’s ﬁne—it’s all relative. We consider we’ve made moral progress by our own
standards, but others are different. We are just lucky that in other countries, they
think working children is ﬁne, and that lower safety standards are okay, and so
we can just outsource the labour there. We get cheaper tech. They get to keep
their own values. Win–win!
B. We do think it’s wrong, but we are hypocrites.
C. We do think it’s wrong, but feel enmeshed in a system it’s hard for ordinary
people to get out of.
D. The concept of ‘childhood’ is culturally relative. The conditions for workers in
tech manufacturing may be poor, but the work of child labourers is misunder-
stood by Westerners who do not understand economic realities.
Universalism as a tool against unjustly dominant views Another extremely
important reason why it may be unwise to adopt a naïve and sweeping relativism,
or to make generalised claims of subjectivism in ethics, is that a major defence
against the imposition of values by certain dominant groups is precisely by appeal to
universally, or widely held, values. Appeal to human rights is one such strategy.
Another strategy is to appeal to values that a group claims to have and show that they
are applied incoherently or inconsistently by their own measures. For example, an
organisation claims to have the value of developing AI to beneﬁt all, yet it can be
demonstrated that certain individuals and groups do not beneﬁt and are even harmed.
(Of course, this strategy often fails, especially if the purported grand ethical values
are there for window dressing.)
Ethics, politics, and power We have noted the frequently made critique of AI
ethics that it focuses too much on individuals and also ignores issues of power and
control that need to be addressed via political solutions. Much work is underway
offering analyses and potential solutions to the issue of power and politics in relation
to AI [14]. It is certainly the case that issues of power and control are prominent,
especially given the realities of ﬁnancial and other powers, heightened by the very
power and control that AI may give to certain companies, groups, and individuals.
This is both economic and ideological, given the power to control communication
and information.
At the same time, attention must be paid both to politics and to ethics. A very tool
of politics is appeal to universally held values—or at any rate, to values which are
widely held. It might help if these are backed up with some formal mechanism, some
internationally recognised body, or some real power. Note that if we claim that the
issues solely concern the exercise of power, the only response is to counter this by
also exercising power. Is it just a contest of strength and inﬂuence? Generally, those
ﬁghting back against what they see as the unwarranted exercise of power, especially
over the vulnerable, feel they need to have not just might on their side, but right.

Philosophy for AI Ethics: Metaethics, Metaphysics, and More
For example, civil society organisations that are observing and often critiquing
the use of AI by governments and large corporations have a vital role to play, and
indeed, as we go forwards into a future where AI plays an increasing role in our life,
this is an essential part of a mature response to ethical, political, and social issues.
Examples
include
organisations
such
as
AlgorithmWatch
and
Article
19 [15, 16]. However, the clout of such organisations derives in large part from
the values upon which they purport to rest, rather than simply from their capacity to
match the power of governments and corporations with their own raw power: the
claim to widely recognised values is a core part of their effectiveness.
We have also seen the difﬁculties of ﬁnding a foundation that justiﬁes any moral
claim. One possible source might be to turn to empirical science. After all, as we’ve
noted earlier, a common trope of progress is of moving towards an empirically
grounded view of the world, including ethics. Work within the social sciences may
point to a compromise view between universalism and relativism, that there are some
values that are, broadly speaking, widely or universally accepted in one form or
another, with local variations in how these are interpreted and local variations in
other values.
7.2.4
Empirical Approaches to Ethics
There is a considerable body of work in the social sciences that attempts to
understand the nature and origin of the patterns of similarities and differences
between moral codes and moral behaviour in different cultures, as well as individual
and group differences and similarities within societies. Relativist positions tend to
stress differences, but there are undoubtedly signiﬁcant overlaps. Understanding the
dimensions of similarity and difference can be extremely useful in enhancing
communication and getting to the roots of disagreement.
For example, moral foundations theory has been proposed by a group of psy-
chologists who consider that several innate systems form ‘intuitive ethics’ upon
which base each culture constructs virtues, narratives, and institutions [17]. These
thus produce the overlapping and conﬂicting moralities around the world and within
subgroups. The ﬁve foundations for which this group claims most evidence are as
follows:
Care/harm: based upon mammalian attachment and focused on nurturance and
kindness
Fairness/cheating: based upon reciprocal altruism and concerned with justice,
rights, autonomy, and proportionality
Loyalty/betrayal: based upon our history of tribalism and concerned with support for
the group
Sanctity/degradation: shaped by the psychology of disgust and contamination and
concerned with ideas of living in a noble way above carnal concerns, with purity
and ideas of bodily contamination by immorality

Authority/subversion: based upon our history of living in hierarchical groups and
7.2
Metaethics
295
concerned with proper respect for legitimate authority and for tradition
In later work, Jonathan Haidt also added a sixth foundation,
Liberty/oppression: shaped by group living, but viewing authority as legitimate only
on occasion [18, Ch. 8].
Exercise 8
Consider the common elements of codes of ethics for AI, as set out earlier in Sect.
2.4. Can you group each of them under one or more of these foundations? Do you
see any clusters and any missing foundations? Consider the implications of your
ﬁndings.
Individual and group differences Haidt has presented evidence arguing the case
that individuals with different political leanings tend to base their moral judgements
upon different elements of these foundations [18, Ch. 8]. The complexity of the
spectrum of political opinion could be a complicating issue, with Haidt relying on
the self-reported classiﬁcation of the degree to which one considers oneself liberal or
conservative. Liberals were found to base moral decisions mostly on the foundations
of care and fairness, whereas conservatives were more likely to base their decisions
on a full range of the foundations. (Note that this very classiﬁcation arises within a
particular time and history.)
Exercise 9
How would you interpret this? There are two opposing immediate responses: the
liberals are missing something important; the conservatives are including some
irrelevant considerations that are a hangover from our tribal and evolutionary past
and primitive notions of contamination and disgust for certain practices. Discuss.
It is important to reﬂect on whether this classiﬁcation helps you to understand
your own responses, not so much because you might be ‘wrong’ but because it can
help you to understand how your responses may differ or cohere with those of others.
It can be useful to foster debate, in helping to understand why some initial responses
from other people can seem so alien at times. However, you may also well feel that
you don’t ﬁt into either ‘liberal’ or ‘conservative’, or come from a country outside
the USA where political distinctions are rather different.
Consider too the question of how we might use empirical data to address
questions in ethics. The data about differences found between the average conser-
vative and the average liberal do not, on their own, answer the question of which
moral viewpoint is better. If we, as outside observers, do not consider that there is
such a thing as ‘better’ or ‘worse’ ways of thinking about ethics, we seem to have
removed ourselves from the cut and thrust of moral life.

296

Philosophy for AI Ethics: Metaethics, Metaphysics, and More
Disgust in Modern Ethics: The ‘Yuk’ Factor, Dignity, and Stigma
Some may consider that the foundation of sanctity/degradation and notions of
purity have no place in ethics and merely represent visceral and emotive
responses which are hangovers from our evolutionary past and have no
place in modern thinking about ethics. For example, Julian Savulescu, who
works extensively in ﬁelds such as medical ethics, has spoken of the ‘yuk’
factor, as the visceral response of revulsion that we often feel initially to
situations which violate taboos or cross boundaries [19]. The ‘yuk’ factor
seems to be a rough descriptor for a purity response. Savulescu argues that
although it can sometimes give a good indication of the right response, more
usually yuk reactions need to be assessed and, if necessary, altered, using
reasoning based upon concepts such as rights and freedom. Our ethical
judgements should be based upon such reasoning, rather than on any kind of
democratic ‘voting’ where the (mere) feelings of the crowd are sourced.
It has sometimes been argued recently that dignity is not a useful moral
concept, as we mentioned in Sect. 2.4.9 [20]. However, the notion of dignity
has persistently that has proven very potent in expressing moral concern with
how human beings may be treated. Perhaps in some ways, it is a way of
expressing a visceral disgust with the wrongful treatment of members of our
fellow humanity.
Stigma is a powerful concept in sociology which can be seen to have some
relation to the notion of disgust. Its classic formulation was by Erving
Goffman in his work Stigma: Notes on the Management of Spoiled Identity
[21]. It describes the ways in which certain human beings are excluded from
full acceptance into certain aspects of society because of certain qualities, such
as disabilities or features of appearance. The individual is disgraced in some
way. The particular qualities which attract stigma can vary. Note that an
individual’s appearance is often critical in producing stigma. Other related
terms are that of abjection, used, for example, by Julia Kristeva and others in
relation to social attitudes towards the aging mind and body [22].
Most would agree that stigma generally needs to be combatted, but note
how many cases involve human frailty and bodily decay and disability, even
including those who fail to conform to beauty standards. Remember that
Aristotle, for all his emphasis on the pursuits of virtue and of the mind,
considered that a necessary component of the good life was to be good
looking! It is useful to ponder this as we consider the human condition and
compare ourselves with imagined disembodied intelligences, or ‘perfectly’
embodied machine intelligences, ones which can be readily repaired and
polished.

7.2
Metaethics
297
Exercise 10
How much of the ethical reactions to human interaction with robots and AI are based
upon notions of disgust, purity, and contamination? Think of some possible exam-
ples, and try to include some current or near current examples as well as some
futuristic examples: the Neuralink brain implant, microchips inserted under the skin
for identity veriﬁcation, sex with robots, and ‘uploading’ the mind to a computer. Is
the ‘uncanny valley’ (see Sect. 2.5.2) an instance of disgust and the ‘yuk’ factor?
Recall our discussion of boundary questions in technology in Sect. 3.3.5 and issues
of purity.
Are there some instances in which we should take note of such attitudes of
disgust, and others in which we should not? If so, can you explain and account for
the difference?
Does disgust ever get in the way of making good moral judgements?
Feelings of disgust, ‘yuk’ responses, often accompany boundary crossing or
violation, such as in crossing human and animal species, or the violation of taboos.
Thinking back to previous chapters, such as discussions of human nature and of
teleological views of the universe and discussions of different normative ethical
theories, consider what assumptions and foundations might lie behind ethical dis-
agreements about such boundary crossing.
Philosophers who are sceptical of our initial emotive reactions to situations and
events may argue that our moral judgements should be more substantially based
upon considered reﬂection and on reasons. However, this presumes that we can
always articulate what these reasons are, and in debate, that we can articulate these
better than any opponents can. Consider the implications of this, especially when we
are tackling new technologies and very unfamiliar territory. Might it be the case that
we are abandoning moral insights without sufﬁcient consideration?
Do the origins of our moral beliefs matter? If it is the case that humans broadly
share some deep moral values, this is unlikely to be a mere ﬂuke, but does it matter
what the reason for such shared values might be? Does it matter what the reason for
differences might be? There is much that could be said on this topic, naturally, but
here again, we will focus on some issues that are pertinent to some questions in AI
ethics—whether the human origin of our values is a problem or not. For this
discussion, you might like to recall our discussion of human nature in Chap. 3.
Suppose, for example, it is posited that our moral values arise from evolution.
Indeed, given the theory of evolution, it’s likely that this has had some role in their
development, although it’s harder to say precisely what contribution evolution per se
had, as opposed to culture, reason, and experience. Moral foundations theory notes
the signiﬁcance of the fact that we are mammals for the ‘care/harm’ foundation;
recall our discussion of care ethics in Sect. 5.4.4. Understanding moral values as
arising from evolution is an empirical hypothesis likely to appeal to those sceptical
of religious or other metaphysical views on the foundations and origins of our
values, yet, if we view morality as a legacy of evolution, this opens up the possibility
that much of that legacy is now redundant and possibly harmful, given the ways we

now live. Julian Savulescu and Ingmar Persson explore these ideas in their book,
Unﬁt for the Future: The Need for Moral Enhancement, arguing that much of our
current ethics is a hangover from evolution and we need a programme of moral
enhancement [23]. Perhaps we should adjust some of the ways in which we live to
better ﬁt our evolution.
298

Philosophy for AI Ethics: Metaethics, Metaphysics, and More
Exercise 11
It is interesting to note that Savulescu and Persson argue that moral enhancement is
particularly important, on the grounds that as a society, we don’t need everyone to be
highly intelligent, but we do need everyone to be good. Consider if you agree with
this, and the implications of your answer for how we might develop and use AI,
including the general question of human enhancement.
Compare and contrast the notion that moral enhancement is most important for
society with the claim discussed earlier that everything that civilisation has to offer is
a product of human intelligence [24].
If we are ‘stuck’ with old patterns of thinking, perhaps AI could help us improve.
However, if our morality has developed around the limits and possibilities of our
biology, then perhaps, even if AI became extremely advanced and conscious (if this
is indeed possible), we could not understand our morality and may have a
completely different moral system of its own. Wittgenstein said, ‘If a lion could
talk, we could not understand him’ [25, part 2, p. 223e]. Perhaps if a group of
artiﬁcial intelligences developed their own morality, we could not understand that.
See also previous discussions about the relevance of biology to ethics, such as in
Sect. 5.4.4.
Exercise 12
Our moral values are ﬁrmly based upon and address our need to live in groups and
the opportunities and challenges this presents, including histories of tribal conﬂict. In
a world of completely self-sufﬁcient artiﬁcial intelligent robots (suppose such to be
possible), ever understand our ethics have an ethic of their own, or indeed, have any
form value system? (We discuss such matters further in Chap. 11.)
This question about the origins of our moral values pertains both to the question
of how we come to form moral beliefs and make moral judgements, or questions of
moral epistemology, and to the question of how moral values might be justiﬁed, the
source of any authority they have. A related issue is the question of whether our
moral views are based upon emotion or on reason and whether any element of
emotion is misplaced. These questions hover in the background of much of our
discussion, but ﬁrst we turn to look at the question of moral authority, asking the
question of ‘who decides’?
Moral authority and AI ethics Even if there is some objective foundation for
moral values, this is not going to drop out of the sky. There will be actual human
beings making decisions and implementing decisions. Moreover, many of the ethical
and value questions concerning AI are entirely personal decisions about how to
respond to the use of AI in one’s own life.

7.2
Metaethics
299
The notion of moral authority builds upon the question of the justiﬁcation of our
moral beliefs. We have seen how one way of addressing the issue of moral justiﬁ-
cation may be via some kind of crowdsourcing methodology. Another approach is
implicit in the role of civil society groups as useful critics of those in power. An
additional frequently cited approach is to consider the question of diversity of those
involved in developing and implementing technologies. The diversity of the kinds of
people contributing may be assumed to lead to the diversity of viewpoints. This then
rests upon an assumption that we will get closer to ‘the truth’ and/or gain a fuller
view of the issues and of how they impact people.
Exercise 13
There commonly are concerns about the narrow perspective of those involved in
developing AI and calls for diverse voices to be included in the debate, policy, and
regulation of AI. Drawing on any material in you have covered so far, and including
any other reading or discussions, give as full and as critical an account as possible for
why this might be the case. What kinds of diversity matter, and why?
Philosophical issues underlying these strategies include the question of whether
we are approaching moral truth, if there are any moral facts to be had, and how we
might discern the ethical questions facing us—questions of moral epistemology.
Working in groups should also alert us to the unfortunate ﬁndings that we are
often unduly inﬂuenced by the views of others. We may conform to the group, and
we may abuse any power we are given, leading us to view others as less valuable and
less in need of respect. The famous Asch conformity experiments, along with much
other work in social sciences, have conﬁrmed our weaknesses [26, 27].
7.2.5
How Can We Gain Moral Understanding?
How do we best gain moral understanding of a situation? This, as ever, is a highly
complex question on which much ink and many words of debate and discussion have
been expended. Whether we conceptualise this as grasping the moral reality that
confronts us, coming to understand some externally given moral law, determining
preferences, considering feelings, and so on, two prevalent themes are present in
discussion: the need to apprehend the situation before us in appropriate clarity and
detail while retaining a general sense of how it ﬁts into wider patterns, and the
necessity of having the ‘right’ approach to emotions. What might the ‘right’
approach be? Whatever side of the complex ‘objective/subjective’ debate, it is
widely acknowledged that personal feelings, selﬁshness, distress, emotional dis-
tance, and so on, can distort one’s perception of the world and interfere with the
capacity to develop an appropriate emotional response. Determining the most
appropriate methodology and response is directly relevant to considering the ethics
of AI, especially when we are concerned with how to draw up guidance for others
and how to develop AI that is aligned with human values or which even ‘makes’
moral decisions.

Philosophy for AI Ethics: Metaethics, Metaphysics, and More
The ‘ideal observer’ Let us brieﬂy consider some contrasting philosophical posi-
tions. Notions of the ‘ideal observer’ have been advocated by many philosophers,
including the philosopher David Hume and the economist Adam Smith, with more
modern accounts such as that of Firth [28–30]. Ethical theories making use of ‘ideal
observers’ try to capture what is necessary to make the ideal moral judgment,
uncontaminated with personal biases and shortcomings. Such an observer may be
characterised in certain ways intended to capture what conditions will produce the
right—the correct, or the best—moral judgement. This usually means having the
capacity to reason and being in possession of all the facts of the situation. In his A
Theory of Justice, John Rawls outlined the ‘Veil of Ignorance’ as a technique that
also attempts to capture a particular conception of impartiality in the construction of
a society. It sets out to control the conditions under which individuals determine
what rules will govern a society they are prepared to live in, by ruling out that they
know what position they will occupy in society while determining rules that should
govern it [31].
Exercise 14
What would your ‘ideal observer’ for AI ethics be like?
Given that we are unlikely to produce such a person in real life, what could an
individual do to strive towards such qualities?
Could a committee of some sort reproduce at least some of these features?
Ideal observer theories strive to overcome human partialities. They also imagine a
situation of full knowledge of the facts. Does this mean that an AI could suitably act
as an impartial observer? Is an AI, with its vast processing power and lack of family
and friends, more likely to approximate an ideal observer than a human? This could
seem promising, but what needs to be considered?
Facts, relevance, and attention Is the ideal observer’s possession of so many facts
all it cracks up to be? In Sect. 2.5.2, we met Dickens’ character Mr. Gradgrind, the
severe headmaster from the novel Hard Times, who was frightfully keen on facts:
‘Now, what I want is, Facts. Teach these boys and girls nothing but Facts. Facts
alone are wanted in life. Plant nothing else, and root out everything else. . .’ [32,
p. 47]. But which facts, and what do we extrapolate from these facts? The challenges
in machine learning of making sense of data should make those working in AI
appreciate the difﬁculty of this question. It is also often clear that simply getting
more and more facts will not help in any way. See too Sect. 5.2.1 for our discussion
on abduction, as well as the importance for methodology in ethics of paying attention
to how we describe and portray situations discussed in Sect. 4.1.1. We need to pay
attention to the relevant facts, and to pay attention to them in the right manner,
but how?
The question of whether more and more facts will help us to achieve better
perception of value issues is a critical question to address, with widespread impli-
cations for how AI is used to gather data about the world, and about us, human
beings.

7.2
Metaethics
301
A distanced, ‘objective’ position that ideal observer theories aimed to achieve is
one such attempt, a kind of bird’s eye view, an attempt to see the situation sub specie
aeternitatis (from the point of view of the universe). An approach we could more
readily achieve in practice could draw upon the shifts in understanding that may arise
from a change of perspective, for example, by imagining yourself in the position of
another, through imaginative descriptions of possible scenarios related to the case
under consideration, through retelling a narrative account to bring to the fore
different aspects.
An example of this that has been discussed by philosophers concerns the prophet
Nathan admonishing King David [33, 34]. To cut the gripping and rather shameful
story short, David had had an adulterous affair with Bathsheba. To cover up her
resulting pregnancy, David then sent her husband Uriah to the front line of battle,
with the certain knowledge that he, Uriah, would be killed. David, being King, could
have his pick of women (and indeed had many wives throughout his life). Nathan
then tells David a story: a rich man wished to entertain a guest, but rather than taking
one of his own many sheep, took the one much-loved lamb of a poor man, and killed
that to feed his guest. David says, ‘the man who has done this deserves to die! He
must restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no
pity!’ Nathan replied to David, ‘You are the man’ [35].
Redescribing situations can often lead to such insights. Sometimes as with
David’s revelation of his own wrongdoing, although perhaps not always, this
involves shifting the perspective and points of view of the individuals involved.
So perhaps, what is needed is not so much a distanced, impartial perspective as of an
uninvolved third party looking down on the scene, but direct involvement and
relationship to the other. Perhaps it involves shifting perspectives, coming anew to
a situation, working out which bits to leave out as distractions, which bits to include
as revealing of new insights.
I and Thou: Attention to the Individual The MIT Moral Machine experiment is
set up in the third person. Participants are attempting to make decisions about the fate
of distanced and anonymous strangers. Could accounts of moral knowledge in the
second person give an alternative account? Recall Kant’s distinction between
treating people (merely) as a means and treating them as an end in themselves.
The latter involves a recognition that others are also agents like oneself, who merit
respect in precisely the same way.
Readers of Kant’s Groundwork for the Metaphysics of Morals will be familiar
with a series of examples he uses to illustrate how to ascertain the right thing to do in
a situation of moral choice [36]. Students often pass over a telling aside: throwaway
remarks from Kant noting that the person in question has spotted that there is a moral
question to ask. A man so far in debt that he is considering taking out a loan he can’t
pay back is inclined to make such a promise, but he has still enough conscience to
ask, if it’s right for him to get out of trouble by such means. A man sick to the point
of despair considers taking his own life, but is still sufﬁciently aware to ask himself
whether taking this drastic course of action might be contrary to his duties. A man in
comfortable circumstances considers giving himself up to pleasure yet still has

enough presence of mind to ask himself whether it is wrong to neglect his natural
gifts (emphases added). What these snippets of text reveal is the mysterious nature of
how we are prompted to moral awareness and to attention to what is important. The
Moral Machine experiment bypasses this thorny issue: one is simply told there is a
moral issue, instructed to make a moral choice, and the ‘relevant’ facts are laid out.
302
7
Philosophy for AI Ethics: Metaethics, Metaphysics, and More
Martin Buber’s inﬂuential book I and Thou (Ich und Du) describes two funda-
mental and different ways of looking at the world [37]. ‘I-It’ relations involve
approaching the world of things and people in the third person as objects. For
example, a tree can be perceived as movement, classiﬁed as a species, and under-
stood in terms of natural laws and in numbers; however, it is perceived that it
remains an object existing in space and time and with a particular nature. ‘I-Thou’
relations are essential reciprocal encounters with another. They do not need to
abandon any of the other ways in which something is perceived but rather encom-
pass every aspect indivisibly united. The quality of one’s relationship with the other
impacts on the self. Through others, we can also encounter ourselves.
Other philosophers who take related approaches include Simone Weil, who
stressed the importance of attention to the individual in how we relate to others
and to the world [38]. Like Buber, her works fall into the category of theology as
well as philosophy and ethics. For Weil, attention was a kind of attitude to the world
that required the emptying of the self and patient waiting, ready to receive the other.
By such means, the situation of the other and their needs can be appreciated. This is a
reciprocal appreciation, with awareness of the self that at a different moment, one
could also suffer.
It is possible to consider individual people from an impartial third-person per-
spective and still treat them as having value and agency that needs to be respected.
However, a second person account of relating to others as distinct situated individ-
uals with a particular and reciprocal relationship to oneself shifts gears to one of
more radical equality and relatedness, equality not in the sense of sameness, but in
the sense that one’s relation with the other goes both ways: rather than literally
looking down from above, as the Moral Machine experiment instructs, one is
engaged in mutual recognition.
Exercise 15
Could machine learning, or any other kind of advanced AI, ever achieve anything
approximating Buber’s I-Thou relationship with the world?
For Weil, attention to the individual leads to knowledge of the situation of
another, which can lead to ethical action. Her idea of the emptying of the self to
receive such knowledge has some overlaps with the notion that the ideal observer is
in possession of all facts, yet for Weil, this essentially requires personal relation-
ships. One could sceptically wonder if such phenomenological perception of the
moral reality of another is indeed possible. If philosophers such as Buber and Weil
are to have any relevance, it might imply that a ‘mere’ machine could not grasp or
appreciate such a personal moral reality, although readers are invited to differ from
this view. This does not, however, necessarily mean that a machine could not have
held information with some moral relevance.

Exercise 16
Discuss and consider arguments for and against the idea that humans can gain
morally relevant knowledge of others in ways that machines cannot, and could
not. Consider arguments that machines might be able to gain morally relevant
knowledge in ways superior to human beings.
Discourse ethics attempts to explain the nature of the communication required in
ethics. It can thus be seen in relation to ideal observer theories, which posit an
impartial outsider forming judgements, as relations between individuals are essential
in the attempt to produce moral insights. Discourse ethics differs signiﬁcantly from
the approaches of those such as Buber and Weil in that there is an attempt to
determine formalised structures of communication that would justify the validity
of moral norms reached within particular settings of communication and delibera-
tion. Discourse ethics thus sees ethics as a rational activity and holds that moral
norms can be justiﬁed if reached through the proper procedures. There are many
proponents of such an approach, perhaps the most prominent of whom is Jürgen
Habermas [39]. Habermas states that a moral norm is valid only if all those affected
by it could accept it in a reasonable discourse; of course, everything will hang on
what counts as a ‘reasonable discourse’. There has been considerable development
of such ideas, both for the moral and the political arena. The general and very basic
point that there should ideally be participation in debate and discourse around AI
ethics is a grounding premise of this book, although much will hang upon whose
voices are heard and how precisely such debate and discussion occurs.
Extrapolation from examples, the universal and the particular, the general
and the personal We discussed the move from theory to cases and discussed the
different ways of describing and hence of drawing conclusions from situations in
Chap. 4. Our discussion of certain questions in metaethics can be used to illuminate
aspects of the general ethical framework from which conclusions may be drawn. I
will take in illustration the parable of the Good Samaritan, told in Luke Chapter 10:
25–37, possibly the parable of Jesus which is best known outside of Christianity, and
one which is frequently subject to different interpretations. The command to ‘Love
your neighbour as yourself’ is found in both Old and New Testaments (Leviticus 19:
18, Mark 12:31), and for many people, it represents an expression of the Golden
Rule, a widely recognised element of morality.
A lawyer asks Jesus for a clariﬁcation of this commandment, asking who is his
neighbour. Jesus replies with a parable about a man who was robbed and left badly
injured on the road from Jerusalem to Jericho, a notoriously dangerous route. Two
religious men passed by without stopping, but a third man, a Samaritan, a group
regarded with some hostility by the Jews, stopped to help, tended his wounds, and
paid an innkeeper for the continued care of the injured man. Jesus commands his
followers to go and do likewise.
But what is ‘likewise’? Let us contrast two broad pictures. One way of
interpreting this is not only as a radical imperative to equal treatment for all
human beings but also as an imperative to considerable sacriﬁce for others and,

moreover, as an imperative to adopt a universalist ethic that requires us to seek out
and consider the situation of all who might need our assistance. This then might ﬁt
well with, say, the utilitarian impulse to consider the total consequences of our
actions. It could ﬁt with an understanding of our ethical obligations and responsi-
bilities that required we have to think and act from a radically universal stance,
taking the whole world into account. It ﬁts with a ‘view from nowhere’, third
personal approach to ethics.
304

Philosophy for AI Ethics: Metaethics, Metaphysics, and More
Another way of interpreting our responsibilities in light of Jesus’s command is
situational and personal: the Good Samaritan came across the injured man and
responded to his needs. The ﬁrst two men ignored him. The parable then could be
interpreted as an instruction to respond appropriately to the situations that life
presents us with. This is also a very tough ask, since even those of us living simple,
quiet lives may be tested by being presented with extremely demanding events. This
sort of approach belongs to a view of moral epistemology as requiring close attention
to the needs of those around us. One could readily imagine that the two religious men
who passed the injured man ﬁrst did, of course, have high moral standards: they just
missed the chance to exercise them when push came to shove. This is a situated,
second-personal viewpoint.
Exercise 17
Consider how suited a sophisticated AI might be to assisting us ethically, or acting
ethically itself, on each of these two broad approaches to interpreting the
Golden Rule.
Consider any implications for how computers might interpret and apply rules
about ethics and how the use of computers might then impact how moral responsi-
bility is understood.
7.2.6
Technology, Attention, and Persuasion
We have highlighted the central importance of attention and of relevance in ethics.
We have also looked at the question of the position and the distance from which we
assess situations, make moral judgements, and act. Many of the questions we have
been looking at concern questions of moral epistemology and hence are related to
questions in epistemology more generally, concerning how we gain knowledge of
the world, even the broad metaphysical question of what ‘reality’ is (which we
discuss in Sect. 7.5). These issues are directly at issue in several central aspects
of AI.
Representing the world through data Machine learning makes use of vast
amounts of data. The quality of the data used, together with the algorithms used to
process the data, is of critical importance. The question of bias in algorithms is well
known and much studied. Gaps in data, errors in data input, and other issues can
have profound consequences and raise serious ethical issues. However, underlying
these and other similar questions, we can ask about the philosophical foundations of

the picture of knowledge that this relies upon. Are we even collecting the right sort of
data to reach a good level of understanding of all types of phenomena? This will
depend upon what phenomena is at issue. Recall the discussion of different meth-
odological approaches, qualitative and quantitative, within the social sciences in
Sect. 5.2.1. This question also relates broadly to the questions about the nature and
value of intelligence discussed in Chap. 5.
7.2
Metaethics
305
Metaphysical and epistemological questions are also raised concerning the under-
lying reality that the data are being used to represent. For example, one such question
concerns the detection of causation from the analysis of data [40]; another concerns
whether the world divides into natural kinds that are captured via the data we collect;
we can also ask the very general question of whether we, mere humans, are in fact
capable of gaining ultimate knowledge of our world. The most profound question
will concern whether we can truly understand human beings and human behaviour
via the collection of more and more data about them and whether even if this is
theoretically possible, if we are collecting the right kind of data.
The drive to improve things by collecting more and more data could have very
good intentions. However, an effect of this will be to collect an increasing amount of
data on individuals, which brings its own ethical issues. It also raises issues of
sustainability. One can also often wonder if collecting more and more data about a
situation is always necessary. Once one realises the small child in the shallow pond is
drowning, it’s irrelevant that this is a slightly annoying kid who won’t eat broccoli
and whose parents regularly park in your slot and watch true crime documentaries on
Netﬂix. One of the many problems, of course, is the difﬁculty of knowing in advance
precisely what information is and is not relevant. The situation of the drowning child
in a shallow pond is urgent, and we need all our attention focused on that (children
can drown extremely quickly in fresh water). However, this very same capacity of
our attention can also be hijacked to less laudable ends.
Seeing the world through technology The work of philosophers and others who
point to the importance of attention to the individual and to the situation at hand only
serves to underlie the issues of how so much of the technology that we currently use,
which makes use of much AI, serves to channel our attention in certain directions.
This can be purposefully designed to good, for instance, for highlighting urgent
issues that deserve our thought or action, or indeed, by very simple means such as
alerting us to hurricanes or other hazards. However, the aim of attention-hungry
technology is sometimes nothing other than keeping one engaged with technology
that relies upon advertising and hence needs attention for revenue purposes. Alerting
us to hazards is also, one might say, itself fraught with hazards. It can increase our
perception of risk and greatly heighten fears. These issues are of relevance to many
ethical questions concerning AI, and we discuss them further in the next chapter
when we consider how AI might represent persons, including issues of great ethical
import such as facial recognition.

The Theory of Knowledge
Summary
A brief account of the relevance of epistemology to AI ethics and its presence in
many of the topics of this book is given, followed by an overview of standpoint
epistemology and its possible relevance to AI ethics.
Questions of epistemology are present throughout discussions of AI in general and
have particular relevance for ethical questions. We have looked extensively at the
question of moral epistemology. Issues such as trust, safety, agency, responsibility,
autonomy, and beneﬁt all involve the question of whether we can rely upon the
knowledge and information generated by AI, and above all, the black box question
and the issue of transparency and explainability involve questions of epistemology.
Philosophers have long debated the question of when we can know that our
beliefs are justiﬁed, including the question of whether and when we can rely upon
the testimony of others [41]. There are differences between the information gener-
ated by machine learning and the ways in which AI may gather and analyse data
from sensors and other sources and the ways in which humans acquire knowledge
and understanding, so that the picture of the world built up by AI may differ from
that of humans. This may matter in some contexts but less in others. The question of
how we can have knowledge of other minds, an essential question in ethics, has long
been discussed in philosophy, and there are complex and fascinating questions about
the kind of knowledge of other minds—i.e. of we humans—that may be generated
by AI and about what picture of ourselves and of others it might produce, which have
ethical implications and which we discuss in Sect. 8.4.
Questions about the reliability of knowledge and information generated by AI do
not simply concern its veracity. We need to consider how it is presented to us and the
tools of persuasion and inﬂuence that may be present, as indicated above in our
discussion of attention. We will look in Chap. 9 at the question of online content
moderation, including the issue of misinformation: to identify something as
misinformation trades upon claims about truth, certainty, and what is taken as
evidence, and hence also questions of scientiﬁc methodology and the epistemic
foundations of different branches of knowledge. As we shall see, claims may also
be made about the routes by which we acquire beliefs, and whether these lead to the
acquisition of trustworthy knowledge or merely result in being persuaded to believe
something without justiﬁcation, and in turn, claims that certain that authorities may
be justiﬁed in acting to suppress or censor certain beliefs. The promise of AI
technologies to unlock vast amounts of information and to increase our intelligence
by increasing our knowledge runs up against the powers of technology to persuade
and to capture our attention irrespective of the justiﬁcation of our beliefs.
Standpoint epistemology and its relevance for AI ethics Let us just take one
example of a question in the theory of knowledge directly relevant to understanding
AI, which is also implicit in some of the possible solutions to seeking good ethical
responses to AI already discussed: standpoint epistemology [42]. This also reﬂects a

broad theme running through this chapter and indeed through much discussion of AI
and of AI ethics: a distinction that may be roughly drawn between a formalist,
‘objective’ approach to issues and a relativised, subjective approach.
7.3
The Theory of Knowledge
307
Bearing in mind again that complex philosophical debates are being greatly
simpliﬁed, let us contrast divergent approaches to the question of knowledge. On
the one hand is a naïve realist view of truth and of knowledge. A simple view of
‘truth’ is that it consists in the match between a statement and reality: the correspon-
dence theory of truth. This may be a kind of ‘photocopy’ view of the truth, where
there is just one view of the world, and we can grasp this unaltered by our
observations and perceptions. Of course, our perceptions and biases may get in the
way; but there is a truth out there to ﬁnd, and it’s possible to ﬁnd this. To determine
the truth, we need to remove our biases and any shortcomings in our perceptions. If
we do this, the truth will reveal itself to be the same, regardless of who is observing.
Along with this view, there may be assumptions that the world consists in a large
body of facts, and the more facts we manage to collect, the better our grasp of the
world.
Such a view—or more sophisticated versions of it—may lie behind the idea that
AI is capable of grasping the truth about the world better than we can, with our many
biases, our limited capacity to collect and analyse information, and our limited
perceptions. Of course, one can immediately ﬁnd many points of simpliﬁcation in
how this naïve view has been presented here, but note its parallels to the picture
presented by the design of the Moral Machine experiment, such as the instruction
that the person making the choice had to imagine that they are out of the scene, with
a view from above of ‘all’ that is happening, along with knowledge of what would
occur given certain choices.
In contrast, consider standpoint epistemology, or standpoint theory. This
approach to knowledge is associated with feminist views but may be used more
generally to refer to theories of knowledge that consider that the point of view, the
social situation of the knower, is relevant to the acquisition of knowledge. In brief,
the claim is that one’s capacity to know and understand a situation may be enhanced,
or worsened, by the perspective one takes and that features of one’s social position
are relevant to this. Some people therefore may have privileged insight into certain
issues relative to others. Sometimes such theories may make speciﬁc theoretically
based claims regarding who has such privileged access to knowledge. Much work in
this area stems from Marxist ideas and claims that those at the top of society have a
reduced understanding of many issues than those at the bottom, who may be able to
gain greater insight into the social and material world through the reality of their
lives. For example, it may be claimed that those who are in a servant class need to
understand the world of those whom they serve, but those in the upper classes do not
have the corresponding need to understand the world of their own servants; the
servant class thus has greater understanding of the world. Other claims made include
the claim that women as a sex class may have better understanding and knowledge of
certain issues than men. Sometimes claims are made that certain positions in society

will grant a better overall picture of the world, perhaps that there are some aspects of
experience and knowledge that only certain people can access.
308
7
Philosophy for AI Ethics: Metaethics, Metaphysics, and More
It should be obvious therefore that many speciﬁc claims concerning standpoint
theory will be contentious to those with different social and political theories. There
will also be differences between those with the ‘common sense’ view that some sorts
of experience in life will assist a person to spot issues that others may miss: for
example, someone who is a wheelchair user will have a good understanding of issues
of the accessibility of buildings, public transport, etc. and may see problems that
others may not. Likewise, women are likely to have had life experiences that differ
from those of men and hence may notice things that some men overlook, and of
course, vice versa; people from different cultures and economic classes likewise
have different life experiences. A major question then is whether there is something
inherent to the identity of individuals or group membership which means that others
could not understand such viewpoints. These approaches to knowledge are obvi-
ously highly contentious.
Answers to this question will have manifest implications for the ethical develop-
ment of AI, for the choice of who is involved in developing and deploying AI, and
for who are considered stakeholders in any consultation. It also has implications for
the production of information and knowledge by AI; for if certain aspects of a
situation can only be grasped and fully understood by certain humans who occupy
particular stances, this implies that AI will never gain such knowledge. Of course,
even if one rejected standpoint epistemology, one might hold that there were certain
aspects of the world that AI would never be able to capture and that wide participa-
tion in AI development, deployment, and assessment is critical because even if, in
theory, others might understand certain aspects of experience, they frequently fail to
do so.
7.4
Philosophy of Language
Summary
Understanding human-level intelligence involves understanding language and hence
the relevance of the philosophy of language. We brieﬂy contrast formal approaches
to understanding language with pragmatics, which seeks to understand the social
context of communication and which is essential to success in natural language
processing.
Language use and understanding is an element of human intelligence, and we have
already seen that questions concerning the capacity of AI to understand language and
to communicate via language recur frequently in ethical questions around AI. We
saw that language may be taken as an indicator of intelligence or indeed sentience.
The epistemological question of whether AI understands the world and has knowl-
edge in ways that parallel human knowledge rests in part on whether AI has or could
have the capacity to understand natural language, and this in turn has many ethical

implications, including the question of how AI might understand humans and how
we respond to AI. These questions in turn rest upon how we understand language.
7.4
Philosophy of Language
309
We mentioned the linguistic turn in philosophy earlier in the twentieth century,
where there was a signiﬁcant emphasis on the study of language and, indeed, in some
cases, to formalised accounts of language. The work of philosophers such as
Bertrand Russell, A. N. Whitehead, and Gottlob Frege and the early work of Ludwig
Wittgenstein in broad terms looked to understand language as a system that can be
reduced to components structured in ways that could be formalised [43–45]. How-
ever, as useful as such formalisation might be for some purposes, such as under-
standing logic, mathematics, and computing, some philosophers came to realise that
such an approach had serious shortcomings in regard to understanding how natural
language and the nuances of human communication actually work within a social
and cultural setting, among them Wittgenstein himself [25, 46].
Around the mid-twentieth century, work in pragmatics started to study more
informal aspects of the use of language and communication within a social context
[47]. This work has developed considerably, both within philosophy and within the
ﬁeld of discourse analysis [48]. Key to such work was the recognition of context,
including social context, expectation, and convention, to understanding how lan-
guage functioned and how meaning was understood and communicated. The variety
of uses of language was emphasised. This work is therefore also critical to natural
language processing and to understanding the many ethical questions that arise
around this.
Prominent among the philosophers working in pragmatics was J. L. Austen, who
worked in ‘ordinary language philosophy’, which focused on attempting to under-
stand and analyse philosophical questions and issues of meaning through careful
analysis of the use of language. Among his contributions to pragmatics is his work
recognising the power of language in the form of ‘speech acts’, performative
utterances that bring about certain effects in the world, and a considerable amount
of further work has developed such ideas.
Austen distinguished between locutionary, illocutionary, and perlocutionary acts
[49]. There are different accounts of how precisely these different acts should be
understood, but in outline, a locutionary act captures what a speaker said. An
illocutionary act is a speech act with which we do something, for example, make a
promise or issue a request, for instance, ‘I’ll get the cat from the vets at 3 o’clock’ or
‘Would you mind passing the ketchup’. Performing illocutionary acts may be
understood in conventional ways or by understanding the context. Thus, ‘Nice little
house you’ve got there, shame if it burned down’ is a threat, and ‘Would you like
some more cake?’ may be an indication in certain social contexts that the speaker
wants some more cake. A perlocutionary act is the effect that a speech act has on the
hearer. For example, the result might be that the hearer passes the ketchup, develops
anxiety at the fear that their house will burn down, and so on. Such work is of
obvious application to understanding language in general, and is being applied to the
context of online communication, for instance, in social media, where communica-
tion may be challenging, where it is applied for analysing and understanding
questions such as online harassment.

310

Philosophy for AI Ethics: Metaethics, Metaphysics, and More
In Chap. 9, we will look at online content moderation and examine H. P. Grice’s
theories of conversational implicature, which presented an account of how shared
conventions govern how meaning is conveyed and understood, and we consider how
such shared conventions might be shaped by the forms of communication possible
with technology.
7.5
Questions in Metaphysics: What Is Reality?
Summary
Many questions in metaphysics are implicit in ethical questions in AI. For instance,
the question of addressing bias in algorithms may tacitly rest upon assumptions
about fundamental categories of the world against which bias is measured. The use
and value of virtual reality raises the questions of the value and nature of reality and
of whether virtual reality is ‘real’ and if so now, which we discuss through exam-
ining David Chalmer’s views.
We have brieﬂy touched on how underlying metaphysical questions can arise
concerning AI and its applications. For example, the ethical question of bias in
algorithms is often portrayed as being concerned with how to remove bias in data
sets, modelling, and use of algorithms, but these debates may presume that it is at
least theoretically possible to have an unbiased use of algorithms, and hence that we
may, via data, capture what the world is ‘truly’ like, what its fundamental ontology
is. This presupposes that the data we collect are adequate to this task and that the
categories and perceptions we use to collect data and which we use to measure bias
can, at least in theory, perfectly represent the world: that the categories we use ‘carve
nature at her joints’ (Plato, Phaedrus 265d–266a) [50]. We cannot here do full justice
to all the metaphysical and epistemological issues potentially relevant to questions in
AI with ethical implications, but exploration of metaphysical and epistemological
assumptions may frequently be useful in furthering ethical understanding.
We will look here at one very broad question, since it is one which we have
already raised in discussion and comparison of ethical theory: the nature of ‘reality’,
and the question of why reality matters to us, if indeed, it does. This is a question that
goes to the heart of central debates in ethics. Does it matter what ‘really’ happens in
my life, or merely what I seem to experience? Likewise, should our moral values aim
to cohere with some moral reality, or with some purpose-driven notion of the world,
a teleological view of the universe? Or can we just make the world and ourselves as
we wish, and according to our preferences, desires, and subjectively felt feelings?
Robert Nozick’s Experience Machine thought experiment threatens to be realised
in the form of virtual reality or the as yet unrealised possibility of a simulated reality,
an all-encompassing virtual reality [51]. Virtual reality is often used in extremely
useful ways, such as in helping to train emergency service personnel and surgeons.
These are to help prepare such personnel for doing ‘real’ stuff. It can also be used for
recreational purposes where there is no pretence that it represents ‘reality’. Ethical

questions arise about the value of ‘real’ experiences when VR, and perhaps in the
future a simulated reality, are used as substitutes for veridical experiences. Recall too
questions we have raised previously about the enhanced presentation of the self via
the use of AI: see Exercise 12, Chap. 4.
7.5
Questions in Metaphysics: What Is Reality?
311
How can we address such questions? One strategy would be to examine the costs
and beneﬁts that accrue when a large part of one’s time is spent in VR used as a form
of entertainment or substitute for life in the ‘real’ world. One problem with such a
strategy is that it may implicitly rest upon prior judgements of the relative worth of
veridical experiences versus virtual experiences. Hence, the strategy of examining
what we mean by ‘reality’ will be a useful approach.
The philosopher David Chalmers’ 2022 book, Reality+: Virtual Worlds and the
Problems of Philosophy, takes the reader through many clearly and simply explained
issues in metaphysics, philosophy of mind, and epistemology to unravel this ques-
tion, a question that he indeed considers sheds light on many age-old philosophical
questions [52]. We will look at Chalmers’ position since he takes a very ﬁrm stance,
that life in VR can be just as good or bad as life in the ordinary reality [52, Ch. 1].
The option that we may have in the future of spending all or most of our lives in VR
is, on such a view, a reasonable choice. Of course, one of the major objections to life
within a VR, a simulated reality, is that this is not ‘real’: a ﬁve dollar bill is a type of
banknote, but a fake dollar bill is not; in the same way, virtual reality is not a type of
reality. Chalmers would beg to differ: he claims that a computational simulation can
preserve the structure of reality. According to his arguments, virtual reality is real,
and objects within a simulated reality are also real: they are ‘digital objects’,
constructed out of data, and are perfectly real.
So what is it to be ‘real’?
Chalmers analyses ﬁve aspects of reality and concludes that virtual reality ticks
all boxes, so long as we are in a perfect, permanent, simulated reality. These are, ﬁrst,
existence, the virtual, simulated world exists, even if it is made digitally; causal
powers, the simulation he imagines contains causation, in the sense that events
follow each other in a regular manner and agents can both affect the world and be
impacted by it; mind-independence, it is not simply the product of the mind of the
person within it; nonillusoriness, in the sense that things are ‘roughly as they appear
to be’—if my whole world is digital, and all the objects in it are digital, then they are
not illusions within this world; and genuineness, a robot kitten is a real object, even if
it is not a real kitten. In an entire life lived in this digital world, every kitten has
always been digital. There are no ‘better’ ‘real’ kittens to be had. He also considers
that simulated characters existing entirely within the simulation could be conscious
if they are constructed in ways that recreate the structures that produce consciousness
in the veridical world. Chalmers argues that objections to his claim are based upon
naïve realism, the idea that the world is truly as we think it is: objects are solid, causal
powers are based upon some force, and secondary qualities such as colours and
sounds represent aspects of an object’s inherent nature. However, we now know that
objects are built up of atoms, and these out of fundamental particles, with competing
accounts of the underlying physics, and so on.

312

Philosophy for AI Ethics: Metaethics, Metaphysics, and More
No philosopher alive has ever managed to convince everybody of the truth of
their theories, and Chalmers’ account of virtual reality is doubtless no exception. The
details of his arguments rest upon answers to debates that have occupied philoso-
phers for millennia. We do not currently have such a perfect and permanent
simulated reality. The criteria for reality that he outlines could be helpful in framing
a discussion of the ethical issues in the use of VR as an alternative place to spend a
substantial part of one’s life. The prospect of technological unemployment, the
realities of current unemployment, and the prospect of using life in VR as an
alternative to building relationships with friends and family, and of achieving action
in the world, are all ethical and social questions that we face now and in the near
future. As with so many such questions, we face them both as a society and as
individuals.
A notable feature of virtual reality is that it is nested inside what we commonly
call ‘reality’. It is the second layer up (or more, if it’s VR inside a VR). Chalmers
addresses the objection that his criteria for reality omit the notion of fundamentality
or originality. He dismisses these as ‘marginal’ criteria for reality. He uses Dolly, the
world’s ﬁrst cloned sheep as an illustration, and claims she is neither original, being
a clone of another sheep, nor fundamental, since she is made up of atoms [52,
p. 117].
Exercise 18
Note that Chalmers concludes that it is only a perfect, permanent simulated reality
that meets his requirements of reality. Could this standard of reality be used to judge
the ethical status of spending large amounts of time in a virtual reality that failed to
meet this standard? Explore and discuss different possibilities, looking at the differ-
ent criteria for reality he proposes. Consider especially the issue that virtual reality is
nested inside ‘ordinary’ reality.
Chalmers claims Dolly the sheep is nonetheless real. Indeed, she is real, or at any
rate, she was real, before her death at the premature age of 6 in 2003. Does his use of
this analogy suggest that the question of whether virtual worlds are ‘real’ may not be
the most important ethical question to consider when weighing up the charms of a
life spent in large part within VR? Or is his use of the Dolly example a misleading
analogy?
Does it matter who made the virtual reality, and why? Does it matter how the
purported causation within the virtual reality operates, whether by ‘natural law’ or by
a complex computer programme? In such a world, would you be responsible and
accountable for your actions and if so, how?
Consider the previous discussions of human nature, of our weaknesses and our
potential and draw on them in your discussions.
A different view is held by Jaron Lanier, a pioneer in actually developing virtual
reality, who has written eloquently about its attractions and its limits [53]. Chalmers’
simulated reality relies upon perfection, which is extremely hard to achieve. Lanier
points out that the introduction of technologies to capture reality, such as photogra-
phy and ﬁlm, were initially greeted with amazement and considered to be ‘exactly’

like the real thing. With familiarity, however, we become extremely adept at spotting
the difference. In such ways, we can appreciate the real world even more deeply.
7.5
Questions in Metaphysics: What Is Reality?
313
Our Sense of the Real
In some contexts, the real matters very much to us. The notion of an original
work of art, a real dinosaur skeleton, a genuine artefact from the ancient world,
thrills us. The converse also applies. A visit to a concentration camp appals,
and such visits are used educationally to help underline the horrors that
occurred there, with the underlying thought that being in the real location
will help to bring the reality home. My friend Lucy once visited a friend of hers
whose grandparents had, unfortunately, sympathised with Hitler. He had
visited her grandparents before the Second World War and given them a
copy of Mein Kampf, which the family still has. Lucy, I should add, is a
marvellously expressive storyteller. As she told me about this book that once
had been in the hands of Hitler, she reached a ﬁnger out. ‘I touched it,’ she
quietly uttered, touching my hand, and we both screamed. I had touched
somebody who had touched something which Hitler had touched.
Note that the sense of ‘the real’ here is mediated through space and time.
We can retain a sense of the real even over such divides, and hence also via our
technologically mediated experiences.
A strange parody of ‘the real’. Many of those who has had the privilege and
pleasure of visiting the Louvre in Paris is likely to have included the Mona
Lisa in their visit. The experience of seeing this world-renowned work of art in
the original is not to be missed. It’s so popular that it’s generally surrounded by
admiring crowds such that it is hard to get a good look. And what are those
crowds doing? Most of them are holding cameras above their heads and
snatching photos of Da Vinci’s masterpiece. Why, since reproductions are
widely available? Presumably, because the tourists’ own snaps make a per-
manent record of their real visit to this real work of art. A work of art they have
scarcely seen. Recall our discussion of Benjamin’s The Work of Art in the Age
of Mechanical Reproduction in Sect. 3.6.2.
Lanier’s assessment of VR involves an appreciation of the intertwining of
technology and humanity. In discussing Norbert Weiner’s book The Human Use
of Human Beings, he distils a terrible possibility from the accelerating increase in
computing power and the possibilities of manipulation of people’s behaviour [53,
p. 58]. Pavlov, Watson, and Skinner are three prominent behaviourist psychologists
of the twentieth century who considered that human beings could be understood
fully in terms of how they behave and that our behaviour can be manipulated and
controlled by conditioning. Like many issues in the philosophy of mind, their work
is of profound relevance to understanding many ethical issues in AI. To understand
the essential points Lanier is making, we need to examine behaviourism and other
ways of understanding the mind. We also need to look at the petrifying idea of the

Skinner box: a dystopian sci-ﬁnightmare which, sorry to say, has already happened.
We discuss behaviourism along with other theories of the mind in Sect. 8.4.

Philosophy for AI Ethics: Metaethics, Metaphysics, and More
7.6
Key Points
How we conceptualise, and how we try to address, concrete ethical questions rests
upon assumptions about the nature of moral reality and of moral knowledge. Unless
this is understood, we may miss issues of key importance and fail to understand our
own biases and assumptions.
Understanding how we form and justify moral claims is critical to any approach
to attempting to ﬁnd answers to questions in AI ethics that are widely acceptable.
The difﬁculty of this needs to be recognised.
Claims about the nature of moral understanding and moral knowledge will have
implications for the question of programming ethics into machines. Certain
approaches to moral understanding that stress personal connection and attention
may present greater difﬁculties.
There are particular tensions in AI ethics between the impetus towards univer-
sality in ethics and in understanding and respecting the local. These are hard to
resolve, but it is important to understand these as we attempt to understand ourselves
and others and seek acceptable solutions.
The understanding and use of artiﬁcial intelligence may rest upon certain assump-
tions about knowledge, language, and metaphysics, which in turn shape the under-
standing of and response to many ethical questions.

Educator Notes
Students with less time or less interest in formal philosophical issues should ﬁnd
sufﬁcient material introducing underlying metaethical issues by working through the
material on the MIT Moral Machine experiment.
Nonetheless, it is important for students to understand how signiﬁcant disagree-
ments at the heart of metaethics underlie many of the central questions in applied
ethics and are highly pertinent to AI ethics in particular, such as the broad question of
how we justify our moral decisions, how we reach agreement, and the question(s) of
the universality of ethics. The broadly termed question of ‘reason versus emotion’ is
generally intuitively grasped, and working through some of this material should
enable students to deepen their understanding and apply it to various concrete and
general value questions in AI.
The sections on theory of knowledge, philosophy of language, and metaphysics
are very introductory but are intended to alert students to how such philosophical
questions in fact underlie many central questions within AI itself.

Debate and extended project or essay topics Exercise 3 concerns the important
methodological issue of the stance from which a moral judgement is best made could
form a good class discussion topic. It would be useful to encourage students to think
of speciﬁc instances, but this will also alert students to the important differences
between ethical theories.
Exercise 18 in Sect. 7.5 on virtual reality may form a good topic for classroom
debate, where students should be encouraged to draw explicitly upon philosophical
ideas and may also have much experience of their own upon which to base opinion
and argument.
Exercise 8 might make a useful class or group exercise consolidating compre-
hension of the most common principles and values in codes of ethics for AI.
Exercises 13 and 14 are closely linked and give students an opportunity to grasp
how the philosophical debates about the nature of moral understanding are linked to
the very practical and vital question of diversity of opinion in AI ethics.

Persons and AI
Abstract We examine the concept of the person, its central role in ethics, and the
cultural and historical variations in how personhood is conceptualised and valued.
Ethical questions in AI include whether the use of technology respects our person-
hood and whether AI may ever be attributed with elements of personhood such as
sentience or agency. We examine respect for persons as an ethical ideal, drawing on
Kant’s philosophy. A model of personhood given by Daniel Dennett is discussed,
including criteria of rationality, self-consciousness, reciprocity, and the conditions
for the attribution of personhood. The question of embodiment and persons is
considered, and philosophical theories of the mind-body relationship are described,
illustrating how these debates may help to illuminate the range of attitudes towards
personhood. We examine the stress on cognitive aspects in many accounts of
personhood and the notion of embodied personhood. Two contrasting models of
personhood, scientiﬁc and moral, are examined, drawing on the work of Charles
Taylor, and addressing different ways of distinguishing between persons, agents,
and things. Last, various questions around the boundaries of personhood with
implications for ethical questions in AI are examined, including personal identity
over time, viewing persons through data, autonomy, and privacy.

Introduction
Summary
This chapter explores the concept of the person, the various ways in which it is
understood, its implications for ethics, and its importance in relation to various
questions in AI ethics. Developments in AI may be seen to challenge the nature,
coherence, and value of the concept of a person and the boundaries between persons
and things, as well as raising profound ethical questions about our treatment of
persons. The concept of a person, while central to much work in ethics, can be
understood in different ways: as a metaphysical or conceptual account of the

individual, as a concept necessarily imbued with moral import, as referring to the
sovereign individual, or as indicating a social role.

Persons and AI
We met the concept of the person in Sect. 4.3 in discussing common assumptions
regarding the nature of ethics. The notion of a person was introduced brieﬂy as an
agent with wants, preferences, and desires for the future, who is aware of themselves
as an individual, and who is capable of acting and judging. It is frequently used as a
marker of a being holding moral value. This chapter focuses on the complex question
of persons and the associated ethical issues in AI. ‘Person’ is often used interchange-
ably with ‘human being’, yet philosophically, it is often used to indicate a cluster of
certain features that human beings possess, yet which are distinguished from the
concept of a human being understood purely as a member of a biological species.
Questions about personhood thus overlap with, but are distinct from, issues
concerning human nature (which we discussed in Chap. 5). In many ways, asking
questions about AI through the lens of personhood can be seen as a means of
organising and consolidating many of the issues that we have addressed thus far. It
highlights some questions concerning the nature of the distinctions and similarities
between human beings and machines, and it can be used to frame many of the ethical
questions, perhaps helping to shed new light on them.
At the same time, this is an incredibly complex issue, since there are many ways
of understanding the concept of a person, let alone the ethical signiﬁcance of the
category of the person. The concept of personhood exposes signiﬁcant differences
between the opinions and attitudes of different individuals, cultures, worldviews,
and religions. It is challenging to write an account that goes: ‘this is what a person is,
now let’s look at the ethical implications for AI’, because determining the category
of a person and spelling out precise criteria for personhood is not only controversial,
it is so intimately tied up with value issues.
Nonetheless, exploring claims about the category of the person and some stan-
dard philosophical issues around persons can help to deepen understanding of
various major questions, particularly of some major controversies and differences
of approach to ethical issues in AI. For example, why was there such hullabaloo
surrounding the allegations that the LaMDA language model had attained sentience?
Why were some people so willing to attribute potential personhood to this AI, and
why did others scoff at the very suggestion?
What ethical issues do we need to address concerning persons? In broad
summary, we can divide these into those affecting humans and those concerning
machines: questions about what ethical treatment persons merit, and how, in various
ways, the use of AI may impact this; and questions about whether AI could, or does,
exhibit personhood, or elements of personhood, including consciousness and/or
agency, and if so, what moral implications does this have. The latter will be
introduced here and discussed further in Chap. 11.
There are some particular questions concerning persons which have been the
subject of discussion for some time and which are pertinent to ethical issues in
AI. These include:

How the category of the person is conceptualised, and how links are drawn between

a conception of the person and its ethical implications
How persons are recognised, or how personhood is attributed
What kinds of creatures are, or could be, persons
Whether there are different categories or degrees of personhood
How persons are individuated from each other and the link between the person and
the social
How persons are identiﬁed over time (in other words, what makes a person now the
same person as one at a later or earlier date)
The question of the relationship of personhood with embodiment
The link between personhood and agency, and questions of degrees and kinds of
agency
The role of cognition, of the self, and of consciousness in accounts of personhood
All of these have resonance to concrete ethical questions in AI. For example, how
we might recognise (or falsely attribute) personhood, or degrees or varieties of it, in
advanced forms of AI; whether a machine could ever attain personhood; whether
forms of technological enhancement might alter who we are as individual persons;
whether it could be conceptually possible to ‘upload’ our minds to a computer, and
whether this would thus be a continuation of our personal identity; whether the uses
of AI enhance or diminish us as persons; and others.
It is necessary to impose some organising principle in exploring such a rich and
complex topic. This chapter thus arranges the discussion through looking at what has
become some standard topics within philosophy. By exploring the problems these
raise and the kinds of questions that have produced the most philosophical puzzle-
ment, this should open the door to seeing how rather different approaches to these
questions are possible, again hopefully encouraging dialogue. The topic of persons is
approached primarily from within philosophical discourse, but it is of course also a
concept explored within social sciences, especially within anthropology, and it also
has strong links with the concept of the self. Hence, as so often, one will constantly
come across issues that are carried forward or discussed from different angles
elsewhere. A major question to explore is how the ideological underpinnings that
may be attributed to AI and the use of AI resonate and interact with the conceptual
and ethical questions around personhood.
Social roles and the individual The word ‘person’ derives from the Latin ‘per-
sona’ meaning ‘mask’. Actors used masks to indicate the characters they were
playing in a drama. The term ‘persona’ was used by the psychologist and psycho-
analyst Carl Jung to indicate a ‘mask’ that someone may adopt to hide the ‘real’
person behind the mask [1]. The question of the social role or roles someone may
play and the potential gulf between these and the ‘real’ person within raises the
critical questions of how we are seen by others, how we would like to be seen, how
we ‘truly’ are, and the link between the individual and the social, all of which can be
asked in different contexts, all of which are relevant to many of the ethical questions
in AI. Here, we are primarily concerned with the notion of the person in their own
right, the individual subject. However, the question of how personhood is seen and

attributed to others, and the question of the relationship between the individual
person and recognition of and by others, both arise from considering conceptions
of the person as an individual subject, and are, as indicated, important to concrete
questions in AI ethics.
322

Persons and AI
We will consider how certain conceptions of personhood that have come to be
prominent within applied ethics may resonate with some work in AI and with the
question of how AI (and intelligence in general) is conceptualised and valued.
Hence, in reading this chapter, it may be useful to recall and reﬂect on some material
from previous chapters, especially Chap. 5.
However, it must be noted that work in areas such as anthropology has demon-
strated that the category of the person as broadly and currently understood within the
West is far from universal in human culture. Marcel Mauss, in a lecture delivered in
1938 entitled ‘A category of the human mind’, argued that in certain societies, the
notion of the individual person was closely tied to particular rigid social roles, in
contrast to a conception of the person more closely tied to individual consciousness
[2]. Subsequent work has cast doubt on Mauss’s general argument, but nonetheless
many accept that particular notions of the individual person are highly culturally and
historically speciﬁc [3]. Hence, we must be aware of the particularity of the con-
ceptions of personhood discussed here; indeed, to some extent, we cannot escape
this awareness, since even among modern thinkers from similar cultural back-
grounds, there are divergent views concerning the concept of the person and its
ethical implications.
Metaphysical and moral notions of the person There is such a close intertwining
of conceptual claims about personhood and moral claims about persons that it is
often hard to untangle the two. Sometimes in common parlance, ‘person’ is simply
used to mean human being. However, the term ‘person’ has a particular use in moral
and legal contexts to indicate a being of especial standing and worth. In the work of
some philosophers, the term ‘person’ is explicitly used as a value term to indicate
some moral claim, such as that a being is a bearer of rights [4]. Other philosophers, as
we shall see, spell out conceptual accounts of what it is to be a person, from which
certain moral claims may arise. Others have argued that what distinguishes persons
from creatures who are also agents but nonetheless, not persons, are precisely
features that are constitutive of a sense of morality, such as the capacity to reﬂect
on one’s beliefs and actions, and a sense of the self.
The question of whether or not a being is accorded the status of a person is one on
which much hangs. The strength of feeling associated with attempts to remedy
perceived injustices around the denial of personhood is such that the starting point
of argument may be the wrongness of exclusion, from which assumptions about the
nature of personhood are constructed. The question of how we recognise and
attribute personhood to others turns out to be a critical and central issue to the
very notion of personhood and hence helps to explain some of the large divisions and
differences of opinion over the attribution of personhood, or related concepts such as
sentience or consciousness, in the case of AI. We saw this in the case of the LaMDA

language model and the strength of feeling, and in many respects, gulfs of under-
standing, between those who saw claims of sentience as a real possibility and those
who dismissed the idea (see Chap. 4).

An Account of Personhood: Respect for Persons
as a Fundamental Ideal
Summary
This section presents an overview of an inﬂuential approach to personhood as a key
ethical concept. In such an approach, the concept of a person represents the unique
individual as a source of ultimate and equal value. The notion of ‘respect for
persons’, which is inﬂuential in the justiﬁcation of notions of universal human
rights, is discussed through the work of Immanuel Kant.
Let us start with articulating a notion of the person and moral status that should be
broadly familiar to many: respect for persons as a key foundation of ethical concern.
The idea that each individual person is of ultimate worth has been said to be
fundamental to moral, religious, and political ideals [5].
However, as we have seen, this view is not universally held, and if we recall some
earlier material, we will see that it is not even universally held within the Western
societies in which this ideal has been prominent. As we have already stressed, the
ancient Greeks had no trouble viewing different classes of human beings as having
different social standing and moral respect. Recall our discussion of consequential-
ism and its variant, utilitarianism, in Chap. 6. One major criticism of utilitarianism
was its precisely failure to protect individuals as individuals (see especially Sect. 6.
2.5). Some may modify their utilitarianism as a response; indeed, for example, John
Stuart Mill also protected the individual through strong arguments for individual
liberty [6]. Yet at the same time, there are many prominent proponents of forms of
utilitarianism who consider that they can meet this challenge, or that (at least some
of) the trade-offs between individuals that follow from utilitarianism are acceptable.
Note then that one issue concerning the concept and value of persons is the question
of the separation between persons and of what ethical trade-offs might be made
between individuals (see Sect. 6.2.5).
A radical equality of persons The notion of respect for persons has a long history,
but throughout much of this, it was assumed that some persons merit more respect
than others: for example, royalty and nobility over commoners; the propertied class
over those without property; men over women. In modern times, however, the notion
of respect for persons is often expressed in the idea that persons are radically equal
and merit equal moral respect, irrespective of social or worldly standing. Different
levels and forms of respect due in social contexts, for example, indicated by formal
titles or forms of address, should not be taken to indicate that anyone has any higher
moral status than any other human. This notion of radical equality has been a driving

force behind much work in politics and in law, underlying conceptions of universal
human rights and ﬁghts for social justice and civil rights.
324

Persons and AI
Respect for persons in the philosophy of Immanuel Kant The notion of respect
for persons is generally considered to have arisen in its modern form from the work
of Immanuel Kant, in his notion of the appropriate way in which we should treat
other persons, described as rational agents [7]. Recall that for Kant, the motivation
behind our actions is critical (see Sect. 1.12). Recall also that for Kant, the notion of a
rational agent involved more than the capacity to follow sets of instructions, or to
work out how to achieve one’s ends, and recall that the notion of rationality involved
did not require or imply an especially high level of cognitive capacity. It involved the
capacity for reﬂective self-awareness (see Sect. 6.3.2). A rational agent must be able
to reﬂect on their actions and consider if these actions are in accordance with the
ideals of the moral law. A creature such as a cat may possess agency, but a cat cannot
think to itself, ‘I wonder if I should stop being so greedy’, or ‘Perhaps it’s about time
I stopped teasing the dog’. A rational agent, such as a human being, can do this (even
though they often fail to do so; a rational agent is one who possesses this capacity,
even if they do not always exercise it).
For Kant, rational agents are the source of value, not a means to create value. For
this reason, he states that one way of understanding the Categorical Imperative,
meaning a moral rule that must be followed for its own sake, not for any contingent
aims (see Sect. 6.3.2), is that we should always treat others never simply as a means
but also at the same time as an end in themselves. Rational agents have dignity, not
price: things with price can be traded one against another. Things possessing dignity
cannot. Rational agents also have the capacity to recognise other rational agents and
hence to treat them with the respect they merit.
The notion that we should always treat others never simply as a means but also at
the same time as an end in themselves is frequently misunderstood to mean we
should never treat another as a means to an end. This would, quite simply, wipe out
society and social interactions as we know them. We could never expect someone to
do a single thing for us, nor us for them. Commerce, everyday interactions, asking
someone to pass the salt, all are impossible under such an interpretation. However, it
is not at all what Kant intended. Rather, we should always at the same time consider
their worth as a person and only treat them in ways that they, as a rational agent,
could agree to. This in turn means that the other person, in accepting your treatment
of them, must also respect their own self: for Kant, it is clear that we have duties to
ourselves, as well as to others.
A simple test for treating a person with respect may be to consider if they consent
to the treatment, but it is vital to note that Kant’s view is not as simple as stating that
we should only treat people in ways to which they consent; because a person may
consent to treatment which no person deserves, or which diminishes one’s person-
hood, rationality, or agency in some way. For Kant, there are things that no rational
agent could rationally will; but of course, we are not always rational; we fall below
our own ideals. Of course, the big question will be what precisely is the treatment

that a rational agent, or a person, deserves and whether one wishes to adopt the
notion of what can be rationally willed.
8.2
An Account of Personhood: Respect for Persons as a Fundamental Ideal
325
Exercise 1
Can you think of any examples where consent is obtained, yet where respect for
persons may be threatened? Include examples even where you are not entirely sure if
respect for persons is compromised, but where it seems there is a discussion to be
had. Compare your examples with others, if you are working in groups, and note any
points of greatest controversy. Try to include as many examples from the world of AI
as possible.
(Hint: if you can’t think of any examples, check this box □to agree to Terms and
Conditions before continuing.)
What precisely Kant meant by treating persons as ends in themselves has been the
source of considerable controversy and debate. Indeed, one of the philosophical
questions that arises in the debates over personhood is precisely how we recognise
and respond to the moral worth and demands made on us by other persons. On one
approach, the moral respect we owe persons is recognised directly in personal
interaction; in another, this can be worked out conceptually, as a conclusion drawn
from the attribution of various necessary qualities to the being in question (although
these approaches are not necessarily mutually exclusive in practice). Recall our
discussion of third personal and second personal approaches to ethics in Sect. 8.3,
in relation to Martin Buber and Simone Weil, and in the quality and nature of
communication in discourse ethics. We will return to these points later in discussing
the attribution of personhood, including in relation to AI.
Many may ﬁnd much of merit in Kant’s views on respect for persons, even if they
disagree on details or even if they disagree on many fundamentals. Much political,
social, and ethical activism is underlined by some notion of the radical moral
equality of all, irrespective of standing in the world. Much of the discussion around
the notion of persons historically has concerned who counts as a ‘full’ person under
the law, society, and ethics: with certain classes of people having had to ﬁght for full
recognition of their status as persons, from those treated as slaves, to women, to
denigrated ethnic and racial groups, to the unpropertied.

Consider some of the previous examples in this book, including any exercises, and
whether the notion of respect for persons is one of the issues. Add any examples
from AI ethics of your own. Collect as many diverse examples as you can.
Issues in AI ethics that raise the question of whether persons are being treated
with all the respect due to them may include surveillance and tracking using AI,
including the question of consent; questions of technological unemployment, and the
possible creation of socioeconomic classes of people rendered ‘surplus’ to the
economy by automation (‘useless eaters’, perhaps); human enhancement via AI,
particularly if this leads to two or more ‘classes’ of humans, those ‘enhanced’ and
those not enhanced. As we shall see, there are different elements within the concept
of a person that present different facets to these questions.

Some Contemporary Models of Personhood and Their
Ethical Implications
Summary
We discuss contemporary models of personhood, as distinct from the concept of the
‘human being’. Some are explicitly produced and used for the purposes of arguing
for certain ethical positions. Others present conceptual models of personhood from
which ethical implications may be derived. We examine Daniel Dennett’s account of
personhood, exploring the requirements of rationality, of self-consciousness, of
reciprocity, and the conditions for the attribution of personhood, noting that space
is opened for the idea that machines could attain personhood.
Historically, then, many have fought for the ideal that all human beings should be
recognised as persons of equal moral and political status. However, some contem-
porary philosophical work has explicitly attempted to argue that the notion of
personhood is not to be equated with the human being. This can lead to claims
that some classes of human beings, or some individual humans, are not in fact
persons, or do not have full personhood. There are also conceptions of personhood
that have been argued to have the implication that certain human beings will be
accorded diminished personhood. Classes of human beings whose status of person-
hood is or has been considered ‘marginal’ include the unborn [8], those with
intellectual disabilities, those diagnosed with ‘brain death’, and those with severe
levels of cognitive decline, such as those living with advanced stages of dementia
[9]. Conversely, some philosophical accounts of personhood have been used to
argue that some of the higher animals, such as the great apes, do possess personhood.
Some have commented that bridging the human-animal divide in this way has
resonance with aspects of indigenous cosmologies [10].
For example, Michael Tooley has outlined an inﬂuential account of the person as
a bearer of the moral rights to life that states that the right to life requires an organism
to have the concept of a continuing self as the subject of various mental states and to
consider that it is such a continuing self [4]. Only such an organism would be able to
express the wish to carry on living and to claim the right to do so; an argument may
be given that these requirements are essential to merit the speciﬁc right to life. In a
similar manner, Peter Singer considers a person to be a being who has both wants
and desires for the future and can conceptualise its future [11].
Exercise 3
Consider this: could an advanced artiﬁcial intelligence have ‘wants and desires for
the future’ and have a concept of its own future? Would this be enough to mean that
we would owe this AI anything morally, such as any duties in relation to it? You may
wish to look back at Chap. 5, at the instrumental concept of intelligence discussed
there, and consider how a machine may be attributed with wants and desires. You
may wish to consider examples from science ﬁction.
Consider your reasons for your answer. Could answers to this question involve
projecting hopes and fears onto AI? Is there any solution to this, and does it matter?

8.3
Some Contemporary Models of Personhood and Their Ethical Implications
327
The above accounts of personhood are only partial, giving conditions for person-
hood which may be necessary but which are not sufﬁcient. Other accounts of
personhood contain more conditions that produce a fuller account of the mental
attributes underlying personhood. Let us look at an account spelled out by the
philosopher Daniel Dennett. We will take this account and use it as a scaffold
from which to discuss some general questions about the concept of a person. We
need to consider how we should characterise personhood, what the moral implica-
tions of personhood are, and how examining different possible facets of personhood
can help expose some of the ethical questions arising from aspects of our use of AI.
The very difﬁculties of presenting a precise and agreed stipulation of what it is to
be a person, and the very difﬁculties of agreeing on the ethical implications of
personhood, will help to account for the range of responses to many ethical questions
involving AI.
This account stipulates that a person is:
A rational being;
To which states of consciousness and mental or intentional predicates (such as ‘is
thinking about his hamster’, ‘is planning to go sky-diving’, ‘has a dull ache in her
left toe’, etc.) are attributed;
Which is treated in a certain way, as a person;
Which can reciprocate this and treat others as persons in turn;
Which can communicate verbally;
And is self-conscious (as opposed to merely conscious: a person has a sense of their
self) [12].
A person need not be a human being What implications might such an account
have for the ethical questions in which we are interested? Such an account at least
begins to open up the possibility that some AI may achieve at least part of the
conditions of personhood. Note that nothing in any of these accounts refers to
membership of a particular species; we see this even in Kant’s account of rational
agency: he believed in the possibility of intelligent extraterrestrial life [13]. There is
nothing in this conception of personhood about any particular way in which these
qualities may be instantiated. There is an implied embodiment of some sort in the
requirements that a person must be able to reciprocate in how it treats another, which
implies the capacity to act in the world, as does the requirement for verbal commu-
nication. However, this requirement does not seem to even necessitate a speciﬁc
identiﬁable body: perhaps some supernatural force, such as a poltergeist or an angel,
might qualify as a person. (It’s not entirely clear to me why the communication has
to be verbal; see below for further discussion of this requirement of personhood.)
Consider the requirement of rationality Unless this is interpreted to mean the
capability for rationality, we mere humans are all doomed. Might this then mean that
another entity that did not have the human propensity for irrationality might be a
‘better’ sort of person? Could this include AI? Failings of rationality may be of two
kinds: simple errors or slips (‘cold’ errors) and motivated irrationality (‘hot’ errors),
such as wishful thinking, bias, or self-deception [14, 15].

328

Persons and AI
Exercise 4
Perhaps AI could help us to avoid errors of reasoning. If rationality is a requirement
of personhood, and if personhood is a moral category, could AI lead us to be better
persons, meriting greater moral respect? Or is it simply sufﬁcient to pass some
threshold level of rationality to merit equal membership of the class of persons?
Consider the pros and cons and any moral consequences.
Recall our discussions of human nature and the frequent observations of splits in
human nature (Sect. 5.4.6) and of elements of irrationality that may occur in humans
(see Sect. 6.2.4 and the discussion of Dostoevsky). The broad idea that we have
‘higher’ or ‘lower’ parts of the self, that humans typically experience some inner
tension between different elements of their person, and that a pathway of growth
towards some development or the resolution of such inner tensions or splits is
desirable, is very widespread. This is also intimately linked to questions of self-
awareness and self-reﬂection, which are necessary conditions for being able to spot
and address splits and tensions between different elements of the self. Could this be
an inherent part of what it is to be a person? Does the simple fact that we have certain
divisions, certain possibly conﬂicting parts of ourselves, always a failing of
some sort? Might an advanced AI thus be better than us if it does not suffer from
such problems?
Consider that the capacity to turn one’s plans and attention towards certain
directions and to overcome the tendencies or temptations towards certain behaviour
may be part and parcel of how we understand what it is to have or to develop a moral
character. Hence, the very presence of such splits, the mode of addressing them, may
be part and parcel of what in fact constructs a uniﬁed person. This also raises the
question of whether a person essentially exists over a period of time. We shall
discuss this further below.
Rationality may simply be thought of as the capacity to reason, to gain knowl-
edge, and so on. In addition, it is also used to capture the capacity to plan towards
achieving goals. In which case, perhaps it is a requirement of personhood that a
person has to have goals. We look further at this as a possible requirement of
personhood below, its implications for AI and for the distinction between persons,
agents, and machines.
The requirement of self-consciousness Mere consciousness, simply having expe-
riences, is attributed to many animals that we would not consider to be persons. The
capacity of awareness of one’s own thoughts and feelings, a higher order form of
consciousness, may be necessary for personhood, as it seems required for the
reﬂection upon one’s plans, actions, and inner states that would be needed to make
judgements and decisions and to carry out plans towards a goal; but does this require
that a person has a sense of a distinct, unique, self? And how might such a ‘self’ be
conceptualised? There are likely to be large cultural and ideological differences in
how such a self is viewed and seen in relation to other selves.
Attributions of personhood Note the interactions with and dependence upon other
persons for the attribution of personhood. To be a person involves being treated as a

person by others, as well as the capacity to reciprocate. Note that although the
concept of a person may be used as an explication of the concept of an individual
subject, each individual subject’s status exists in interdependence with that of others.
If the requirement of recognition by others persons is a necessary part of what it is to
be a person, it is as if personhood is a club where you have to be sponsored by an
existing member before you are allowed to join [9].
8.3
Some Contemporary Models of Personhood and Their Ethical Implications
329
There are inherent dangers in this (and we will look at some possible examples
later). History shows us that many human beings have indeed been cut off from the
club of fully recognised persons. For example, in her 1792 book, A Vindication of
the Rights of Woman, Mary Wollstonecraft (mother of Mary Shelley, the author of
Frankenstein) argued (as many others have) that women had been denied the
education necessary to develop their full rationality, and this only acted to reinforce
the notion that women lacked the necessary level of reason to engage fully in the
world with men [16]. People living with various disabilities, people from different
ethnic and racial groups, have likewise been disregarded and viewed with scorn.
Conversely, recall our discussions in Sect. 4.4 about describing situations through
stories and images and what we might or might not read into our interpretations of
these. Perhaps we might equally attribute personhood, or elements of it, entirely
erroneously.
Some of the difference in reaction to the LaMDA language model ‘sentience’
case may be explained by the fears of those who are concerned that the capabilities
(whether thought of in terms of personhood or a related concept) of an AI may be
being overlooked, with consequent wrong-doing, a moral slight, to the AI.
Exercise 5
Consider an advanced language model such as LaMDA or any other example of
AI. You may wish to take an example from science ﬁction, perhaps the computer in
Arthur C. Clarke’s 2001: A Space Odyssey, or the AI from the ﬁlm Her
[17, 18]. What elements of the AI’s behaviour might be thought to indicate person-
hood, sentience, and/or consciousness? Consider how someone might wish to
attribute these qualities, even if you disagree that the criteria are met.
Dennett’s criteria explicitly include the capacity for verbal communication. Do
you consider this to be vital or not? Might its apparent presence be an especially
persuasive factor for some in the attribution of possible sentience to LaMDA?
A general question to consider regarding our use of AI is whether this technology
may affect our propensity to attribute personhood and whether it may inﬂuence or
reinforce particular ways of understanding personhood. We look below at a current
controversy about how we might fail to recognise personhood in other human beings
and consider the possible links and lessons for AI.
The requirement of reciprocity This is an interesting requirement to consider,
especially from the point of view of how we use AI and how AI regards us. Note that
this requirement of reciprocity could be interpreted as an ideal to aspire towards if it
refers to a condition of mutual full regard and attention to the needs of others, for

example, expressed in Kant’s notion of respect for persons, Martin Buber’s notion of
the I-Thou relationship, or the requirements of respectful discourse.
330
8
Persons and AI
However, as with rationality, this must be understood as an ideal that few of us
would live up to, certainly all the time. We routinely fail to notice those around us,
even those close to us. Moreover, a requirement of reciprocity could be interpreted to
mean that we recognise the personhood in those to whom we wish harm or wish to
manipulate. For if we wish to deny or denigrate the personhood of others, this
involves recognising that they are indeed persons. We may manipulate or abuse
others by ignoring their personhood and treating them simply as objects or as
nonperson creatures to be manipulated and used, or we may realise that we need
to take into account and target their very personhood, in our desire to manipulate,
denigrate, or use them. The corollary of this is that we may have to recognise that the
very worst of our abusers are indeed persons themselves.
A major set of questions regarding AI, and indeed many other forms of technol-
ogy, is how it impacts interpersonal relationships. We have already seen many cases
and exercises, where the question of whether our use of AI may enable or enhance
such reciprocal recognition of personhood.
Exercise 6
Suppose we were being manipulated by AI. Perhaps multiple forms of technology
are tracking and monitoring us, feeding us tailored information, using forms of
persuasive technology to capture our time and attention, diverting us towards certain
activities, experiences, and ideas, and away from others. Over time, facial recogni-
tion and emotion recognition AI builds up a picture of ‘who we are’ and uses that to
ﬁne-tune the ways in which each one of us is being manipulated. Perhaps the
manipulation is to nudge us towards buying certain products, perhaps it is towards
accepting more and more technology into our lives, perhaps it is towards accepting a
role as one of the underclass of permanently unemployed as automation takes our
jobs, perhaps it is to accept a role as one of the underclass as expensive AI-powered
human enhancement takes off.
The question is: because this AI is treating you as if you are a person, might you
have to eventually conclude that this sophisticated system of AI was also a person,
distributed across a wide system of technology? Might it possess some of the
qualities of personhood, if not all?
Recognition of Personhood and the Turing Test
With the development of computers, there was great interest in the question of
whether computers could truly ‘think’ and possess intelligence. The Turing
Test, originally named by Alan Turing as the Imitation Game, was based upon
a Victorian parlour game where players had to guess on the basis of answers to
questions if a person was a man or a woman [19]. Turing adapted this to
propose a test where a computer would give answers to series of questions. If
(continued)

the inquirer could not tell whether the answers were being given by a computer
or by a human being, then this means the computer displays an intelligence
indistinguishable from that of human-level intelligence [20, pp. 29–36].
8.3
Some Contemporary Models of Personhood and Their Ethical Implications
331
Much has been written about this test, and entrants competed for many
years in the Loebner Prize Competition in attempts to pass the test. The lure of
the test for some, perhaps aided by the importance of language for human
culture, and the element of reciprocity in linguistic communication with a
computer, may entice the thought that passing the Turing Test means that the
computer is interacting with a human in the way that a human is, and thus
genuinely is intelligent, and perhaps has other qualities that a human
person does.
The test is limited however in that the interactions with the computer are
strictly limited. Even if a computer passed such a test, after the competition
was over, its identity as a computer could readily be revealed. Linguistic
ability is only one aspect of intelligence, only one aspect of personhood, and
the interactions between computer and human being (or person) possible
through language are only one small part of the reciprocity needed to form
the hallmark of personhood.

of
Personhood,
and the Approaches of Different Disciplines
I ﬁrst became seriously interested in philosophical accounts of personhood
near the start of my career. A friend, Tessa Podpadec, who was researching the
experiences of people with mild intellectual disabilities, came round for
coffee, and casually picked up a copy of the Journal of Applied Philosophy
and started reading it. She was soon trembling with rage. The journal
contained an article discussing the issue of ‘marginal personhood’, suggesting
that some human beings, including those with intellectual disabilities, may not
fulﬁl all the requirements to qualify as persons. Our discussions led to pub-
lishing two papers, exploring both the nature of persons, and the attitudes of
those from different disciplines towards the personhood of human beings with
signiﬁcant cognitive impairments [9, 21].
The approach of those working in the ﬁeld with people with intellectual
disabilities was to presume personhood, and search for it, seeking a relation-
ship with each person. The approach of the philosophers in question was to
produce a criterion of personhood, and then see if individuals measured up
to it.
Consider this in relation to different ways of attaining moral understanding,
discussed for instance in Sect. 7.2.5.
One conclusion might be to appreciate the value of consulting or working
closely with those from a wide range of different relevant backgrounds and
experiences.

Food for thought: Could it be that seeking and presuming personhood in
each other is a way of fostering and enabling the personhood of each of us to

Interlude: Mind and Body
Summary
Since a key question regarding persons is that of embodiment, brief overviews of
central philosophical positions regarding the relationship between the mind and the
body are given: dualism, physicalism, behaviourism, functionalism, and the
extended mind theory. The main purpose is to indicate how the various attractions
of the contrasting positions may illuminate the question of how personhood is
understood and how different positions regarding mind and body may cast light on
some central ethical questions in AI, such as the way in which persons may be
viewed by AI.
We have raised the question of whether persons are essentially embodied. A
backdrop to such questions is the relationship between the mind and the body. We
therefore pause to survey the major philosophical theories concerning mind and
body. Some of the central questions and attitudes that arise also help to explain the
difﬁculty of the questions with which we grapple concerning personhood. It is also
important to consider why different rival theories concerning the relationship
between mind and body may be attractive and gain proponents. In teaching philos-
ophy, I always try to emphasise the importance of understanding the attractions of
opposing theories and positions, even if one wishes to reject them thoroughly.
Something can be wrong for interesting reasons, and moreover, the more you
understand the attractions of a position, the more you can (a) incorporate those
attractions into your own position and (b) understand those with whom you disagree.
This is never more important than when we are considering issues of ethical and
practical import.
There is a very large range of philosophical positions concerning the nature of the
mind and the relationship between mind and body. It can almost seem as if between
them, philosophers have cooked up every possible theory and then drawn lots to
ensure that there is somebody, somewhere, who adheres to each one of the concep-
tually possible (and in some cases conceptually impossible) theories regarding the
nature of the mind. How can we explain how mind, which encompasses so many
different elements of cognition and which is capable of consciousness, arises in the
midst of this material world, and how can we explain its relationship to the material
world within which it is placed, but from which it seems manifestly distinct?
Dualist theories advocate a conceptual gulf between mind and body. The
plausibility of dualistic accounts stems from the phenomenology of minds: to have
a mind is to have subjective awareness, which seems to be a completely different
manner of existence from being a material object. However, the dualist must explain

the vast weight of evidence that there is an extremely close and apparently causal
connection between the mental and the physical. A classic exponent of dualism was
Descartes, who considered that the mind consisted of mental substance, which was
immaterial yet somehow mysteriously interacted with physical substance [22]. More
contemporary dualists include those who reject the idea of a mental substance but
nonetheless do not consider that minds can be fully reduced to a materialist account;
property dualists are not people who own two homes but are those who consider that
although mental properties and physical properties may be attributed to the same
thing, such as events in the brain, mental properties cannot be reduced to or
explained entirely in terms of physical or material properties [23]. Conversely,
materialists think nothing more than ordinary matter is needed to fully explain
the mind.
8.4
Interlude: Mind and Body
333
Many religious or spiritual views propose some manner of dualism, believing that
a nonmaterial soul, spirit, or self exists and can survive physical death, in an afterlife
or via reincarnation. Survival the death of one’s current human body may, however,
be understood as involving the resurrection of the body, as in standard Christian
belief.
Exercise 7
Bracketing philosophical concerns about its possibility, if we could ‘upload’ our
minds to a computer, would this be equivalent to murder, or to attaining further life?
Outline how someone might argue that this amounted to a continuation of life for the
individual and how one might argue against this.
How might one argue that this was (a) desirable; (b) a horror story?
Suppose one’s mind could be copied into a computer, while one remained alive.
Would there then be two of you?
Physicalist views One place in which to hunt for the mind is obviously the brain,
given the weight of evidence that brain activity is vital for consciousness and other
mental activities. Even Descartes considered that it was within the pineal gland in the
brain that the connection between mental and physical substance was somehow
made [22]. A simple materialist account based upon the brain was the mind-brain
identity theory for obvious reasons: claiming that mental events are just events in the
brain, and nothing more [24]. The link between activity in the brain and thought
seems irrefutable (at least to us: the ancients often thought otherwise). Mental
phenomena seem to arise from physical events in the brain, but are they
nothing more? More recent views are far more sophisticated and draw heavily on
neuroscience and cognitive science in the attempt to understand and explain the
mind, in terms of both cognition and of the phenomena of consciousness, and note
the contribution to mental states of activities elsewhere in the body. Eliminative
materialism rather radically argues that our common sense idea of the mind, of the
essential subjectivity of its mental states, is mistaken and that the mind can fully be
understood in purely material terms [25]. If the intricacies of the brain that give rise
to cognition, consciousness, and agency could be reproduced with sufﬁcient accu-
racy, then it seems possible that we could create a mind. Some approaches to

artiﬁcial intelligence are indeed based upon attempts to reproduce neurological
accounts of the brain, making detailed attempts to copy biological brains [26, p. 12].
334

Persons and AI
Zombies A stumbling block to any materialist view of mind is literally the stuff of
horror ﬁlms: the zombie, although philosophers tend to use the concept in a less
alarming manner. It seems entirely possible to imagine that there could be creatures
with activity within their brain exactly on a par with activity within human brains,
yet who had no subjective inner experiences [27]. There is nothing that it is like to be
a zombie (perhaps hence paradoxically capturing part of the human horror at the idea
of becoming a zombie: the thought that there may be ‘nothing that it is like to be me’
may have a certain incoherence, but it nonetheless strikes fear into many of us).
Hence, the possibility of the zombie has been used in attempts to refute physicalist
positions and to reinforce the dualist case. There are debates around whether
zombies are conceptually coherent and what, if anything they show regarding the
rightness or wrongness of physicalism.
Other minds The topic of zombies, however, reminds us of another major issue in
the philosophy of mind: the problem of our knowledge of other minds. How can we
truly know what, if anything, is going on in the mind of another? A dualist view
which emphasises the subjectivity of experience and the separation of the mental
from the physical struggles with this sceptical problem. Descartes mused that
perhaps the people he saw walking in the street were actually automata with no
living thinking being beneath the hats and coats. See Sect. 8.5, for a discussion
concerning the notion of embodied selfhood: perhaps there is a way of attributing
mind more immediately through the communications of the body. The sceptical
problem is also manifest in the criteria in Dennett’s account of personhood, that to be
a person involves having personhood attributed by others; we saw above the fragility
and dangers of this vulnerability.
Behaviourism Other materialist views opt for the body rather than the brain.
Philosophical behaviourism made the startling claim that the mind can be understood
entirely in terms of behaviour, including linguistic behaviour. This is startling to
many because to have a mind is to have a point of view, to see the world from a
particular vantage point, to have a subjective sense of self. However, the philosoph-
ical behaviourists denied that to understand people, we need to refer to anything
other than outward behaviour. We may not even have to describe behaviour in terms
of actions imbued with intention and motivations: the aim may be to describe
behaviour simply in terms of bodily motions, including of course sounds uttered
and so on. The philosophical behaviourist Gilbert Ryle writing in the twentieth
century famously ridiculed Descartes’ dualist position as the ‘ghost in the machine’
[28]. One problem is that many consider that something akin to such ghosts exists.
Behaviourism may seem now to be the least promising account of the mind,
although it may perhaps form a basis for the attribution of minds to machines, but
we will return to it again presently. Understanding a behaviourist stance can be a
useful tool for understanding some elements of the use of AI.

8.4
Interlude: Mind and Body
335
Functionalism can in some ways be seen as a far more sophisticated version of
behaviourism, which draws heavily on computer science and argues that the mind
can be understood in terms of the functional capacities of the brain, the operations it
carries out [29]. A material substrate is needed for this, but it matters not what this
substrate is. All that matters is what outputs are generated from what inputs. It could
be carbon-based; it could be silicone-based; it could be made of green cheese. Such
approaches have obvious relevance for AI. It seems possible that a sophisticated
machine could be a mind if some version of functionalism is correct. There is much
to be said for and against functionalism, and it repays close study for any interested
in AI and computing, including the ethical questions.
However, one question to consider is whether an explanation of the relationship
between the mind and the body captures all we need to capture to understand ethical
issues; and, because that we are dealing with comparisons and contrasts between
humans and machines, although a theory which makes such direct comparisons
possible and perhaps readily available, we must for that very reason at least ask the
question of whether we are viewing humans too much through the focus of how we
understand computing. Perhaps functionalism can capture much about the mind, but
is there more to add concerning the nature of the person?
Mind and body—but how much body? Descartes opted for the pineal gland.
Others opt for events in the brain. Others for the whole brain. Others for the whole
body. Functionalism does not necessitate any particular physical substrate, and
indeed, a famous thought experiment considers whether the entire population of
China giving signals to each other might be able to manifest the functions of a mind
[30]. The example was suggested by Ned Block as an argument against functional-
ism, as demonstrating the absurdity of attributing, for example, states of pain to the
entire population of China, but others disagree.
Exercise 8
If functionalism is correct, how might we draw the boundaries between separate
minds? If we could attribute a mind to a computer, and if computers can be linked to
each other, what, if anything, would mark the boundaries between one computer
mind and another?
Consider then that if human minds could interface with computers or be directly
linked to the Internet, and thus through this to other human minds, what would
happen to the distinction between different persons?
Could this be a moral improvement upon our present situation?
Consider: if it might be possible for a mind to be connected to other minds in such
a way, would such a mind still be a person?
Theories of externalism hold that the mind is not entirely contained within the
brain or indeed the body. Externalism may hold that the content of mind (mental
content) goes beyond the body. For example, the content of a thought about ‘that
chair over there’ includes essential reference to a particular chair. Other forms of
externalism claim that the bearers of mental content may be external to the mind
[31]. A very simple, rough-and-ready introduction to this (rather complex) ﬁeld can

be given thus: Our mind essentially stores memories, and much cognition relies upon
the capacity to hold several things together in our consciousness at once. We can,
however, write things down and refer to these rather than relying on retrieval from
our brains. There is no space for an adequate discussion of these complex but
important theories here, save to note that our growing use of technology to assist
with cognition might be thought to result in extending our minds even further: could
we become united with computers in such a way, even if we are not physically
connected as we might be with say, a neural implant? We discuss the question of the
connection between humans and machines further below.
336

Persons and AI
Subjectivity, reductionism, and the ﬁrst person Hence, the philosophy of mind
has grappled with the mysterious question of the relation between mind and body.
This thumbnail sketch in no way does justice to the complexity and sophistication of
the debates. One bone of contention is whether the attempt to explain the mind in
material terms, or in functionalist terms, is a reductionist view that reduces the mind
to ‘nothing but’ something else: ‘nothing but’ neurons ﬁring, ‘just’ a computer
programme running in the wetware of a brain, ‘nothing but’ the complex behaviour
of a person operating over time. Or perhaps the reluctance felt by many to explain the
mind in materialist terms is a kind of misplaced hubris, somewhat like the confusion
and resistance felt by many when Darwin announced to the world that we were
‘merely’ a kind of ape [32].
There is surely something more at stake in this case. The felt subjectivity of the
mind seems stubbornly resistant to reductive explanation; many ﬁnd eliminative
materialism deeply counterintuitive. As a philosophy undergraduate, I harboured the
secret thought that those who consider that consciousness can be completely
explained in material terms must themselves be zombies, because otherwise there
is no way they could ﬁnd such an explanation of their own experience at all
convincing. I have met some eliminative materialists, and they seem fairly normal,
or at least, ‘normal for philosophers’, seemingly passing the Turing Test, but on the
other hand, how would we know?
Exercise 9
Some consider that if we could fully understand and reproduce the human mind and
human intelligence, that somehow threatens or demeans us, reducing us to ‘nothing
but’ a technological product, perhaps. Others have a completely opposed attitude,
that it will reveal our intricacies, and indeed, that such an achievement would only
reﬂect well on us. What is your inclination, if any, and why?
A point of view And this brings us onto another distinctive aspect of our subjec-
tivity that seems to separate it from the ‘ordinary’ material world: it has a point of
view. There is a gulf between the ﬁrst personal view and the third personal view.
This is both an everyday part of our experience and yet deeply mysterious. It is one
of the striking things about the oddness of some accounts of the mind, such as
behaviourism, which seem to omit the ﬁrst personal view entirely and look at the
human being as it were only from the outside. We have a sense of self, a conscious-
ness that is isolated from others, other minds which we assume are present, but

which we can never directly access. This puzzling aspect of the mind that resists
adequate explanation so forcefully is a central feature of our ethical universe. We are
surrounded by others whose subjectivity remains a moral certainty, yet at the same
time a mystery, whose subjectivity demands our recognition, and whose recognition
we too require. As we explored earlier (see Sect. 7.2.3), the shift between different
ways of thinking and approaching others, from third person to second person, can be
highly signiﬁcant in ethics. Thus, the capacity of views of the nature of mind to
encompass and illuminate these aspects of subjectivity and of relations to others is of
profound signiﬁcance in the ethical stance we adopt.

Behaviourism and the third person stance in AI Behaviourism as an approach to
the mind was not conﬁned to philosophers pursuing counterintuitive theories from
the safety and comfort of their oak-lined libraries and well-stocked common rooms.
Many nineteenth- and twentieth-century psychologists were also behaviourists,
using it as a framework with which to understand human beings. Ivan Pavlov is
famous for his dogs, who salivate (response) when shown food (stimulus). They
were trained to associate a bell with the appearance of food [33]. Eventually, they
could be trained to salivate at the sound of the bell alone. Similar programmes of
stimulus-response conditioning have been used to teach pigeons to play the piano as
well as similar ‘tricks’ and were also thought by behaviourist psychologists to
underlie human learning and behaviour. John B. Watson and B.F. Skinner also
pursued such programmes of research [34, 35].
Everyone will be familiar with the idea of laboratory animals such as rats being
trained to respond in various ways to rewards: the ‘Skinner box’ is a closed
environment that the experimenter can control in order to observe and manipulate
the animal’s behaviour. Rumours that Skinner kept his infant daughter in such a box
have been vigorously denied by her but doubtless represent the horror invoked by
imagining such a model applied to human beings [36]. But if we are relieved for
Skinner’s daughter, should we be concerned about ourselves? Has a new kind of
Skinner box become our reality as we live lives controlled and constrained by
technology?
Philosophical behaviourists concerned themselves with claims about how the
mind should be understood. Methodological behaviourism was more than just a
theory about understanding humans through conditioning; it was a methodological
approach to psychology that considered that outwardly observable behaviour should
be the basis for psychology. There was no need to include introspection or conscious
phenomena. Using observable phenomena only, humans could be understood; but
what’s more, not only understood, but manipulated by others, since the more one
understands how behaviour is shaped by the input from the environment, the more
humans can be controlled [37].
Readers may be considering the discussion of Anscombe’s work on intention in
Sect. 4.4.5 and the ways in which we might attribute different intentions to the same
set of actions described in certain ways; indeed, how precisely actions are described
can be open to wide interpretation. It is important to realise that even if such
behaviourism is rejected as a complete account of the human mind, it can still be

used as a way of understanding and manipulating behaviour. Indeed, conditioning of
our responses is extremely effective, just as, even if we do have free will, we can
certainly still be controlled.

Surely, none of us live in any kind of Skinner box, and surely, those who interact
with us are not simply observing us through our behaviour and using that alone to
understand and interact with us? Not so fast. One does not need to be in a virtual
reality to be surrounded by technology that is both tracking us and sending signals
that condition our behaviour. An increasing amount of our life is lived online,
through phones and computers, and more and more of our behaviour can be minutely
monitored, whether via our use of devices connected to the Internet of things, to our
phones tracking our location, our searches, our manner of typing, facial recognition,
and so on. Among all this, we are prompted and enticed to behave in certain ways.
Exercise 10
‘AI and the everyday technologies that use it, treat human beings like lab rats. We are
seen as subjects of study to be manipulated, observed from the outside, and as we
busy ourselves about our various concerns we are “scrutinised and studied, perhaps
almost as narrowly as a man with a microscope might scrutinise the transient
creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of water” [38]. Data about our behaviour
are collected with every click and every move. Conversely, many attempt to attribute
agency, autonomy, and even humanity to artiﬁcial intelligence, or at least to project
that consciousness and moral value will attach to artiﬁcial intelligences in the future.
We are seen through the dehumanising one-way mirror of behaviourism, while AI is
seen through the humanising lens of a view of the mind that demands reciprocity
from us. This is a reversal of how things should be.’
Consider points for and against this statement.
We have looked at various accounts of human nature. A common feature is the
claim that humans have different aspects to their natures, with splits or divisions
within the self. This may go together with some account of how to harmonise these
in better or worse ways, on which basis, character, and moral success in life may be
assessed. One kind of failure may be the failure to resist social pressure, the failure to
manifest free will and agency. Recall that for Kant, it was essential that one noticed
that a moral question had arisen, and stopped to consider options (Sect. 7.2.5). A
philosophical viewpoint can inﬂuence ethical reality even when it is not strictly
adhered to. It can greatly impact how others interact with us—manipulate might be a
better word here—and it can impact upon how we see ourselves. Viewing ourselves
and our capacities through certain restricting or liberating lenses can make a vast
difference to our future and to our fate. Seeing yourself within certain parameters, or
as capable of exceeding them, can generate a self-fulﬁlling prophecy. Is modern
technology enticing us into a world where we view ourselves through a
behaviourist lens?

Are Conceptions of Personhood Too Focused
on the Cognitive and the Rational?
Summary
Modern conceptions of personhood dominant in thinking around AI and in applied
ethics tend to stress the mental and, in particular, the cognitive aspects of person-
hood. This section examines some troubling ethical implications of overly focusing
on the cognitive, especially for certain groups of humans, such as those living with
dementia or other cognitive difﬁculties, and considers the role of embodied person-
hood and emotion. The inﬂuence of technological models of the mind on concep-
tions of personhood is considered.
We have considered earlier how attitudes towards technology may shape how we see
human beings, and vice versa. Dominant models of how we understand what it is to
be a person may inﬂuence the question of whether we might possibly attribute
personhood to AI and how we attribute, or fail to attribute, personhood to each
other. A ‘worst case scenario’ would be modelling personhood in ways that falsely
attributed it to one class while falsely denying it to another class. Could this be a
danger? An account heavily focused on the cognitive, including hallmarks of
rationality and of verbal communication, may incline towards the attribution of at
least some elements of personhood to machines while leaving some human beings in
a more tenuous place. Consider the case of people living with dementia in relation to
personhood, and in particular, a focus on the cognitive in accounts of the person.
This question has some resonance with the question of how we perceive and
respond to AI and robots in that the prospect of dementia arouses fear in many
people, for completely understandable reasons. Indeed, elderly people as a class may
also arouse fears for many in certain societies; Julia Kristeva has used the term
‘abjection’, which can be thought of as a despised element within human beings,
absent a well-formed self, and which has been used to describe attitudes towards the
elderly [39]. However, attitudes towards the elderly vary greatly within different
societies. Reﬂecting on such attitudes may be instructive as a background to
considering possible uses of technology such as life extension, the quest for a certain
immortality by ‘uploading’ the mind to a computer, as well as more mundane uses of
technology such as the apps, care robots, and surveillance technologies already used
or proposed for elderly people in general as well as for people living with dementia.
Many might argue that the central issues are not the problems that technology might
solve but how these problems arise and are viewed, given social attitudes.
The care of people living with dementia is sadly sometimes less than ideal. Work
in the ﬁeld of care has been greatly inﬂuenced in recent decades by work advocating
person-centred care. Tom Kitwood’s inﬂuential work advocated caring for the
person living with dementia in ways that nurture and aims to maintain individual
personhood as much as possible, emphasising the complexity of the condition and its
manifestation and the social and environmental factors that affect severity, progres-
sion, levels of distress, and symptoms [40]. We can see this as ﬁtting with Dennett’s

criterion of the attribution of personhood by others, yet as raising question marks
over how some of the other criteria may be understood. How precisely might seeing
someone as a person be achieved in practice, especially in cases where a person may
be struggling with communication and cognition?

The team of researchers with whom I have been fortunate to work at the Geller
Institute of Aging and Memory at the University of West London, along with the
research of many others in the ﬁeld, has contributed towards understanding how the
needs and personhood of people living with dementia may be, with the best of
intentions, misidentiﬁed. For example, consider the attribution of irrationality to
behaviour, speech, and expression. Observing basic nursing care on hospital wards,
my colleagues identiﬁed occasions where ‘looping’ may occur. ‘Looping’ is a term
borrowed from Goffman’s study of institutions, whereby an individual’s behaviour
or expressions do not ﬁt the requirements of a particular institution; hence, the failure
of the person to comply with what is expected of them leads to a reinforcement of the
very label, which is taken to justify their treatment within that same institution
[41]. Resistance to basic care, an extremely common phenomenon with people
living with dementia, may frequently be interpreted as a manifestation of dementia
and hence as indicating irrationality rather than as a possibly rational objection or
expression of dislike; the label of irrationality then acts as a ﬁlter through which
subsequent behaviour is interpreted and thus seen as a manifestation of disease rather
than of agency [42].
This is not to deny the real cognitive issues that arise with dementia; it is to note
that these may be attributed, and heightened, even produced, in part as a result of the
social and surrounding conditions and expectations. Expectations of rationality
within a certain context may lead to a reduced capacity to see the person and
reluctance to enable and allow an individual to exercise what capacities they have.
An embodied selfhood Other work has made similar ﬁndings. Pia Kontos’ work
with people living with dementia in care homes observes that people may retain a
sense of self and a capacity to interact with those around them and to understand the
social world, even after losing language capacity and suffering signiﬁcant cognitive
loss. She found that people may retain a sophisticated sense of the requirements of
social interaction, for example, etiquette and expectations at dinner, offering comfort
to the distressed, and a sense of self exhibited by awareness of dress and of how they
may appear to others, even after language capacities are largely lost [43]. Commu-
nication may be achieved through the body, both through body language and
expression, and through dress and personal appearance; yet in theoretical models,
even in accounts of respect for persons, the precise role of the body in communi-
cating and maintaining personhood may be neglected at the expense of a more
cerebral, cognitive model [44].
Likewise, my colleagues found that on hospital wards, older people in general
and people living with dementia in particular were less likely to be dressed in their
own clothes, often wearing standard hospital pyjamas, and may have personal
grooming neglected. They were also less likely to have personal possessions around
them than were younger patients. This impacted both how they were seen by staff

and others and how they saw themselves. Occasions when a person changed into
their own clothes and had assistance with grooming sometimes had a transformative
effect on both treatment and behaviour [45]. If the requirement that others attribute
personhood is part and parcel of what it is to be a person, we must pay close attention
to how this is achieved and to what gets in the way.
8.6
Personhood Continued: Two Approaches to Personhood, Agency, and Machines
341
What might we conclude from these observations concerning how we understand
and identify personhood? Perhaps we need multiple approaches to understanding
what it is to be a person. Some philosophical models of the person which may be
used as the basis for some recent work in applied ethics, and which may also be
drawn upon when considering the potential aspects of personhood in AI, focus on
the cognitive, the rational, the verbal. Does this skew the answer in certain direc-
tions? The picture of the person built up from accounts such as that of Dennett also
prioritises the mental, and even though some manifestation within a material sub-
strate may be necessary, precise details of embodiment seems a contingent issue. The
person, ‘the self’, seems primarily mental, in contrast to the physical. Very differ-
ently, Pia Kontos, drawing on the work of philosophers such as Merleau-Ponty,
suggests that a notion of embodied selfhood is needed to understand how person-
hood and the self are manifested in individuals and communicated between individ-
uals [46]. This embodied selfhood has many aspects particular to the human
condition, including social and cultural elements. Perhaps, then, if we were ever to
attribute personhood to AI, to robots, we would have to have a similarly rich way of
recognising and attributing it. Perhaps if we think of personhood through a cognitive
model, we may ﬁnd it in computers, only to fail to ﬁnd it in certain humans.
Exercise 11
Bearing these points in mind, consider whether your responses to some of the
previous exercises concerning the use of AI in relation to people living with
dementia might have been different in any way. (See, e.g. Chap. 2, Exercises 6, 8,
10, 11; Chap. 3, Exercise 6; Chap. 4, Exercise 7; Chap. 5, Exercise 13.)
8.6
Personhood Continued: Two Approaches
to Personhood, Agency, and Machines
Summary
We examine two approaches to personhood and the distinctions between persons,
agents, and things, expounded in an essay by Charles Taylor, which can cast light on
different approaches to vexed questions in AI. One scientiﬁc approach understands
persons as distinct in the possession of consciousness, but in terms which mean there
is only a matter of degree in terms of complexity between persons and things
(machines). A moral approach sees persons as distinctly separate from other agents
and from things, in possessing a point of view and having a sense of the signiﬁcance
of their own purposes.

342

We have looked at some possible hallmarks of the mental and raised some questions
about the essential nature of mind. Must it be embodied? Is felt subjective experience
an essential part of the mind? Are minds thus essentially separated from each other?
Is the subjectivity of the mind essentially irreducible? What is the proper place of the
cognitive, and of reason? We also need to consider the relationship between the
concept of minds and the concept of persons.
Let us now look at another attempt to frame these questions, in Charles Taylor’s
paper The Concept of a Person [47]. Taylor begins by characterising the person in a
way that should be by now generally familiar. A person has a sense of self, can have
life plans, make choices and have values; importantly, the sense of self is the origin
of any life plans and choices. A person can respond to other persons. It becomes
clear that the concept of a person is richer than the mere concept of a mind; Taylor
investigates the boundaries between the concepts of a person, an agent, and things,
which category includes machines. How are these boundaries drawn, and how rigid
are they? We can immediately see the relevance for AI ethics. Moreover, since we
are trying to understand the depth of differences of opinion regarding these issues,
Taylor distinguishes two contrasting approaches to the question, the ﬁrst a broadly
‘scientiﬁc’ approach stemming from the revolutions in thought of the seventeenth
century and the second a broadly moral approach.
In the ﬁrst approach, consciousness is a hallmark of persons and is understood in
terms of the capacity to represent the world to the self. These representations form
the basis for the capacity of persons to respond to other persons, a necessary
component of morality. Agency is understood in terms of performance—of adaptive
behaviour seen as accomplishing some goal. Hence, there is no sharp boundary
between agents and things. A machine can likewise demonstrate agency. This ﬁts
well with computational ideas of intelligence. A quantitative difference only exists
between things and persons in terms of the complexity of computation.
In the second account, agents are sharply divided from things; the hallmark of an
agent is that things matter to them. They have purposes. The idea of evaluation if
thus built into the idea of an agent. Machines can have purposes only in a derived
sense if these have been put there by design by an agent with their own original
purposes. This division between derived purposes and original purposes may be
useful to consider in relation to the questions regarding the attribution of agency to
humans and to machines that we have addressed previously (see, e.g. Sects. 2.4.3, 4.
4.5, and 6.4).
For something to matter to agents, there must be some evaluation built into the
purposes that agents have. How do we distinguish persons as a subclass of agents?
Consciousness does not do this because agents who are not persons may be
conscious. Persons are distinguished qualitatively, not by degree, in terms of the
matters of signiﬁcance to persons. They recognise higher demands. This is a
recurrent claim regarding persons: the capacity to rank and judge purposes, includ-
ing one’s own actions and thoughts. Taylor emphasises the distinctive nature of
those human purposes which are peculiarly human and have no parallel in animals.
In this approach, the purposes that make up human cultures are sui generis and
cannot be reduced to purposes we can share with animals, such as survival and

reproduction. Hence, different human cultures may likewise have distinctive pur-
poses that are not readily accessible to those from other human cultures. Taylor’s
emphasis on human persons can thus be explained by the lack of examples of any
other kinds of person that we have on which to draw, although this account does not
rule out the possibility of nonhuman persons.
8.6
Personhood Continued: Two Approaches to Personhood, Agency, and Machines
343
The ﬁrst, scientiﬁc, account is reductive. There is a matter of degree and differ-
ence of complexity only between persons and things that are not persons. It appeals
to those wishing for a certain kind of explanation of the world. The second, moral,
account also appeals to a certain kind of explanation of the world, one which retains
a sense of signiﬁcance, of meaning, perhaps of mystery. From the perspective of this
second account, one may consider that the ﬁrst account reduces persons to ‘nothing
but’ complicated machines. We should note that Taylor also comments that the
scientiﬁc account also has a certain kind of higher, or spiritual, purpose to it, as it can
represent a striving to rise above the ‘merely’ human level and to understand the
world from ‘above’, as it were, or from an objective perch that transcends our limited
grasp of things.
Recall the discussion of higher and lower aspects of human nature and Kant’s
claim that we need to ask ourselves if our actions ﬁt with the moral law. Mill’s
distinction between higher and lower pleasures also gestures towards such a distinc-
tion. An inﬂuential paper by Harry Frankfurt, ‘Freedom of the Will and the Concept
of a Person’, distinguishes between ﬁrst-order and second-order desires; second-
order desires are desires about desires, concerning which desires become one’s will,
for example, the desire that one does not desire to eat more chocolate cake; to
exercise such second-order desires is to manifest free will [48]. Such an approach
might be thought to show that it is only a matter of computational complexity that
distinguishes persons from machines and that a complex machine might likewise be
produced that incorporates second-order desires. Others might consider that these
would only ever be ‘derived’ purposes. The resolution of such philosophical issues is
highly relevant to how AI is conceptualised and to many ethical issues.
However, as hard as these philosophical issues to resolve, the distinction Taylor
draws between these different standpoints of approach towards the question of what
a person is and the boundaries between persons, agents, and things (machines) may
be useful in helping to understand the nature and depth of disagreement in AI ethics
over these issues and may help to explain the perplexity that we can feel in trying to
grasp these issues. The complexity of the notion of persons is such that there may
legitimately be different ways for us, as humans, with our complex mix of purposes,
to try to grasp it.
Indeed, our very own natures as creatures capable of taking up different stances in
relation to ourselves, of inner subjectivity, and as outward observers of our own
actions and inner states, may help to explain both the attractions of these different
stances towards the question of what a person is, a scientiﬁc, reductive account, and
an account based on morals, meaning, and signiﬁcance, and their seeming mutual
opposition. We have seen, too, in theories of ethics, how approaches based upon
distanced, third-person perspectives and accounts based upon close, second-person
relationships with others both have their attractions. Perhaps, as persons, we are

doomed to this perplexity, by our capacity to adopt different stances towards the
universe and towards ourselves.

The Limits and Boundaries of Persons
Summary
Ethical questions often concern boundaries or limits, their proper place, and the
consequences of disrupting or crossing these limits. This section examines a number
of questions concerning the nature and limits of persons that have ethical implica-
tions for AI: the continuation of the same person over time; the boundaries between
persons and things; the construction of ideas of the person through data; the
particularities of embodiment such as the signiﬁcance of the human face; autonomy
as an expression of respect for the individual person and its limits; and privacy.
We turn to consider some questions about the boundaries and limits of personhood.
These issues raise many ethical questions, particularly for AI. Questions about the
boundaries of a person shape a host of ethical issues, including how the ethical issues
of privacy are understood and how the value of personal autonomy is understood.
We have been considering whether strict or porous boundaries may be drawn
between persons, agents, and things, and this raises vital questions for how we relate
to and use technology. The capacities of AI magnify these questions. I do not feel I
have in any way altered who I am as a person because I see the world through
glasses. Were there to be some AI implant which is heightening my vision to that of
an eagle, or labelling everything I see with its history, chemical composition, or what
have you (I’m making this example up by the way), perhaps I would feel I was
becoming, or had become, a somewhat different entity. If some AI implant altered
certain personality traits, changed my sense of humour, shifted my interests so that I
never read a book again but became a fanatical follower of ice-hockey and started
breeding tarantulas, others might start to think I was a different person too.
The question of embodiment needs to be addressed. It relates closely to the
question of the individuation of persons, which, as we have seen, is a critical
question in ethics; the boundaries between our human bodies draw fairly clear
lines around our identities as persons. The extremely heated debates over abortion
only go to prove this point, but more than this, although human beings may not be
the only persons, we are persons, and for us, our bodies have a particular signiﬁ-
cance, albeit one that has different resonance for different individuals and at different
times and cultures. We will also look at the question of how persons are observed:
given the subjectivity of persons, could outward behaviour and the kind of data that
may be collected by AI ever fully capture what it is to be a person?

8.7
The Limits and Boundaries of Persons

8.7.1
Personal Identity over Time
The philosophical questions about persons we have examined so far concern how a
person is conceptualised. Philosophers have also puzzled over the question of the
identity criteria of persons over time. This question also has to grapple with the issue
of the inner subjectivity of personhood: that it feels like something to be a person.
Hence, we could imagine that we might wake up one morning and be in an entirely
different body, perhaps even in the body of a giant insect, as Kafka imagined [49],
yet from the outside, nobody might know it was me. Even if one is a materialist
about the mind, it’s possible to imagine this, even if one thinks it’s conceptually
incoherent. Hence, it is possible to imagine that one’s mind might be uploaded to a
computer and that one somehow survives this [50]. Indeed, for those who ﬁnd this
thought horriﬁc, part of the horror comes from the paradoxical capacity to imagine
surviving a process which would also at the same time destroy who one was.
(Of course readers might have very different responses.) There seems to be
‘something’—one’s self—which we can imagine enduring despite great change.
The tendency to identify the self with mental attributes means that many philoso-
phers have considered that the identity of a person over time is to be found in mental
or psychological continuity.
A general problem with pinning down criteria for personal identity over time
based on mental qualities is the unmistakable problem that we tend to forget many
things (indeed, we forget most things) and that our personalities also change over
time. Indeed, John Locke presented the puzzle of a man who, as a child, robs apples.
As a middle-aged man, he can no longer remember doing this. As an old man, he can
now recall having stolen the apples [51].
Exercise 12
Is this the same person?
If we could use AI to enhance and retain our memories, would this help to solidify
who we are as people? Could this be a beneﬁt to people in general, and in particular
to people living with dementia? Note that we forget a vast proportion of what we
ever experienced. Discuss.
The embodied nature of persons also creates problems for questions of personal
identity over time. Our bodies change and grow; their material composition changes
entirely every few years, and their form also changes. This change may be gradual,
along a recognisable biological trajectory, or it may be sudden, as when a limb is
amputated.
A simple answer to the question of personal identity over time is that the
boundaries of the body mark the boundaries of the person; the normal changes we
see over the life course are to be expected and do not undermine individual identity.
A problem with this is that the body does not in other respects seem to capture
precisely what it is to be a person. Moreover, many people may have a considerable
number of artiﬁcial additions to their bodies: artiﬁcial lenses, cochlear implants,

artiﬁcial joints, stents, and so on. The list is likely to lengthen as medical devices
proliferate.
346

Persons and AI
Exercise 13
If your body is gradually replaced bit by bit with numerous medical devices, at what
stage, if any, would you no longer consider it your own body?
If your brain is replaced, bit by bit, with computerised parts, at what stage, if any,
would you consider it no longer (a) your own brain, (b) your own mind, (c) the
question makes no sense to me? (Of course you may well change your mind about
this as it proceeds!) How might you go about answering this question?
There are also conceptual issues involved. Change in and of itself does not
necessitate change in identity: the identity of something may be found in qualities
other than its material composition. Heraclitus said that no one ever stands in the
same river twice because it will be neither the same river nor the same person
[52]. But a river has to have ﬂowing water in it, or it would not be a river. Likewise,
if a person did not change at all, they would not be a person, for at least one’s
thoughts and perceptions would change in response to the environment, and one
would be doing something, even if one was merely standing still on a pillar for years
at a time. The question is what change is allowable for the continuity of each
category of a thing. The nature of these changes and their extent will vary from
category to category. A heap of sand has no organising principle, so its identity may
change with the removal or addition of a few grains. A machine such as a bicycle has
an organising principle, so changing the saddle, the tyres, the wheels, may still mean
it’s the same bike; cannibalising its parts to make a go-cart may be a different matter.
But what of persons?
All-or-nothing, or a matter of degree? One vital question, of relevance for us, is
whether persons can change in degrees or whether being the same person is an all-or-
nothing matter. Some expressions of ethics, and also religion, involve claims that
each individual person has a unique essence, spirit, or soul from whence springs their
value. The idea that we may have partial continuity with future or past selves,
however, may appear to make sense of some of our experience and provide answers
to various sci-ﬁthought experiments about teletransporters, as well to other similar
examples. The philosopher Derek Parﬁt in his book Reasons and Persons argued,
using many thought experiments, that what matters is not personal identity itself but
psychological continuity; we could have psychological continuity with more than
one future self [53]. Parallels between Parﬁt’s view and Buddhist views of the self
have often been made, although these are by no means strictly similar [54].
For another approach, recall, for example, Aristotle’s notion of the development
of moral character, practical wisdom, over a life, and the aim of happiness measured
over an entire life span. If my character changes with time, as a result of my efforts
and directed will to develop wisdom, is this not a unifying force that keeps my
personal identity intact? Recall our discussion above of Taylor’s account of two
ways of looking at persons. On the one hand, we may simply see some connected-
ness with future selves, a matter of degree. On the other hand, we may judge in terms

of what is of most signiﬁcance to us as persons, and if that is retained, see the same
person, but if it is lost, see the person as lost. The question is, what is of such key
signiﬁcance to persons?
8.7
The Limits and Boundaries of Persons
347
A narrative account of personhood An organising principle holding persons
together may be found in narrative accounts of personhood: the striving, over a
life time, to carry out (reasonably) coherent life plans, the attempts to mould, grow,
and improve oneself and one’s moral character, and so on, may be seen to form a
basis upon which we can attribute continuity of personhood, despite some changes,
and indeed, precisely because of some other changes [55, Sect. 2.3]. There are
different accounts of how to understand the narrative links that enable personhood.
Stories of personal transformation—from violent prisoner to qualiﬁed social worker,
from drug addict to rehabilitation counsellor, and so on—are precisely some of the
cases where we most see the human spirit: the person we currently see and admire
cannot be admired, if the past person was literally not the same person. In other cases
of radical change, we might feel rather differently.
Exercise 14
Might AI facilitate our capacity to construct and pursue a strong narrative structure
of purpose in our lives? What particular ways might it do this, and are there any ways
in which it might in practice act counter to this? Think about the technologies in use
or possible which might facilitate how we present and plan our lives.
8.7.2
The Distinction Between Persons and Things
Thus as we have seen, on some accounts, although persons are embodied, the
distinction between persons and things is sharp and indivisible; on other accounts,
it is permeable. We certainly work and operate in entangled and close relationships
with networks of both people and machines. Does this weaken our own boundaries,
and if so, does it matter? Does this mean there could be shared agency, shared mind,
within networks of humans and of machines?
Many observe that our close relationships with technology are rapidly becoming
even closer. There is a ﬂow of information both ways between various forms of AI
and us human beings, both collectively and individually, and we are increasingly
dependent upon and entangled on a minute-by-minute basis with complex assem-
blages of technology. Various scholars examine these questions and the entangle-
ment of the human with the nonhuman, both in the form of the hardware and of
information, the data, that is gathered about us. In examining how we use technology
and data currently and how we may use this in the future, some scholars challenge
the conceptual distinction between persons and things, often stressing the impor-
tance of data and information in how the world is constructed, including the self. For
example, Braidotti calls for an approach to the ‘posthuman knowing subject’, which
no longer adheres to a notion of human exceptionalism and which assumes a notion
of matter as intelligent and self-organising. Braidotti stresses the mind-body

continuum and the continuum between nature and culture, drawing on the work of
the philosopher Spinoza [56].

Explicating and assessing such work is complex, but one of the difﬁculties can be
expressed quite simply: suppose some notion of human exceptionalism is a key
aspect of a cultural, ethical, or religious set of values; and suppose our task is to
consider the ethical questions around the adoption of new technologies, the use of
data involved in this, and the growing entanglement between human beings and
these technologies. Then with what basis are we shifting away from a current set of
values towards a new set, and is there a danger that we may simply be describing a
situation of signiﬁcant changes and accepting new technological disruptions to our
lives, rather than assessing them? Complexities abound: recall, too, that, as we have
seen in our discussions of different ethical theories, the notion of human exception-
alism is neither universal in philosophical ethics nor understood in a uniform
manner.
Deborah Lupton is a sociologist who has produced a large body of work,
including work which examines technology and our use of data. She describes
human-data assemblages that she claims render distinctions between the human
and the nonhuman indeterminate. She explores the boundaries of human nature,
how to conceptualise human beings, and the boundaries around the living and the
nonliving [57, p. 22]. These questions are similar to those we have explored in this
chapter and earlier in considering theories of human nature. Donna Haraway has
used the term ‘compost’ to refer to how the human and the nonhuman may become
part of each other; our boundaries are not ﬁxed, we make and become objects
[58]. Lupton draws on scholars such as Marenko, who discuss how technology
may become ‘enchanted’ for us so that we no longer sharply distinguish between the
technology and our own bodies, especially if we view them as ‘smart’ [59]. Note that
notions of enchantment are used in slightly different ways by different scholars
[60, 61]. Recall our earlier discussions of the attribution of meaning and signiﬁcance
to AI and robots (see Sect. 4.4).
Exercise 15
Consider the items of technology that you use most frequently and which are the
most central to your life. Consider, too, that humans have long used tools, and with
some exceptions, humans have long had intimate connections to clothing. Many of
us are also, indeed, collectors or even hoarders of objects. Some of these objects we
credit with special status such as ‘art’, ‘antique’, ‘collectable’, and so on; we may
even name our cars. For many of us, the design of our surroundings, especially our
domestic space, is of particular signiﬁcance, and for some may be an intimate
expression of privacy, of community, group belonging, or of self.
Reﬂect on whether there is a quantitative or qualitative difference in how our use
of technologies involving AI, including the use of data, may or may not be altering
how we see ourselves and our connection with and boundaries between objects.
We should also remind ourselves that the boundary drawn between human
persons and things is drawn sharply by some but less so by others. We have already
seen Taylor’s analysis of how different viewpoints on the person, the scientiﬁc and

the moral, may draw this in different ways and yet may be, although in tension, both
attractive in their own ways. The very project of AI may be conceptualised in ways
that challenge any sharp distinction between persons and things (although not
necessarily so). There is also considerable awareness that there are cultural differ-
ences here. In Shinto thought, it may be claimed that an acceptance of techno
animism means spirits may animate machines, and technology can be attributed
characteristics which are also attributed to humans and other agents [62, 63]. There
are thus no sharp boundaries drawn between the human person and other aspects of
reality. Japanese attitudes towards robots and their acceptability may sharply differ
from attitudes in the West [64]. Indigenous philosophies may also see softer
boundaries between humans and the natural world [65].

Understanding Persons from the Outside: Constructing
Persons from Data
In the section on behaviourism above 8.4, we considered how behaviourism can
view individuals from a third-person stance, from the outside, as it were, and
Exercise 9 asked you to consider whether the use of AI to collect and analyse data
about us in this way may be dehumanising. Work such as Shoshana Zuboff’s
Surveillance Capitalism has underlined and helped to raise awareness of how
corporations may use data about us for their own purposes, not for ours; govern-
ments of course may also do this [66]. Research exposing the biases in the algo-
rithms
that
use
personal
data
likewise
has
produced
cause
for
alarm
[67, 68]. Inaccuracies, power imbalances, and loss of control are key issues. Another
concern may be that the way machine learning draws up a picture of the human
world is quite unlike the ways in which other humans may do so; this can add to
feelings of dehumanisation, as does the common expressed idea that data is the ‘new
oil’, making data about individuals a commodity for others. Add to this the sheer
amount of information that can be attained about individuals, the number of different
ways this can be obtained, the variety of information that can be attained, the levels
of detail possible, and the 24/7 nature of this potentially ubiquitous information
gathering.
How might such data gathering and analysis affect how we see ourselves, how we
see each other, and how we are seen by others, including our peers and those with
more power? Are we persons, business opportunities for others, or could we be both
at once? This is one of the many examples of how AI and other technologies may be
shifting experiences and concepts central to our understanding of ethics, value, and
the social world.
A counter to such gloomy thoughts of control and manipulation may be found in
work which ﬁnds that many people may use such self-monitoring as a way of
gaining self-knowledge and a sense of self-mastery. Lupton writes about the possi-
bilities of new ways of understanding our bodies through data [57]. Through studies

of those engaged in self-tracking, she sees this as an expression of embodiment, with
data used as a rational practice for individuals, with the potential to increase
autonomy. Note too, how self-tracking may be strongly associated with ideas of
self-mastery, self-improvement, and the use of technology for personal progress and
a move towards the ideal. Moreover, sharing such data can act to cement bonds
between those in online communities engaged in such activities.

Persons and AI
We looked earlier at the idea of a ‘persona’, a socially presented version of the
self. Lupton talks of the ‘data persona’ [57, p. 117], an idea of the self as it is
presented to others and formed out of data. Perhaps then, we are not so much
changing our core idea of our self, but adding new ones.
Exercise 16
In Chap. 2, we considered the use of surveillance technology to watch over elderly
people and people living with dementia, for example, through the use of apps to
communicate remotely via a tablet. Deborah Lupton uses the term ‘intimate surveil-
lance’ to describe situations in which online data are used to watch over those close
to you [57, p.102]. When might such ‘intimate surveillance’ step over the line of
acceptable conduct? Consider different scenarios and consider the reactions of
different individuals involved, as well as the different value issues affected. Consider
if the capacities of the technologies themselves may nudge us over the line of
acceptable behaviour, or if they may be able to preserve dignity and enhance
personhood in any way.
Exercise 17
How might such self-monitoring and the construction of ideas of the self through
data and information gained via technology impact upon ideas of who we ‘truly’ are?
Compare and contrast with ways in which we get knowledge about ourselves and
feedback from others and from the world without the use of such technologies.
8.7.4
Persons and the Signiﬁcance of the Body: Faces
and Facial Recognition
We have seen in our discussion of persons how we may be pulled in different
directions in considering the matter: the reality of the subjective experience of
ourselves, and our experience of interactions with other subjects whom we also
assume have subjective experience; as against the outer, objective way of
conceptualising both ourselves and others; the tendency to think of the self as
primarily ‘mental’, while also recognising the fact of our embodiment. The concept
of a person may not be the same as that of the ‘human being’ and may not demand
any particular kind of embodied substrate, but the fact remains that we are the prime
example of persons that we know and that we are embodied and are of a particular
species. Moreover, the concept of a person requires an element of reciprocity and the
capacity to communicate with others (or at least the potential to do so). This

communication has to be achieved through some physical means. (At least, telepathy
is probably false: but who knows.)
8.7
The Limits and Boundaries of Persons
351
Our faces are vital to this. Human faces are extraordinarily expressive, and their
signiﬁcance in social interaction has long been recognised [69]. This connection
through faces plays a role from the moment of birth: the whites of human eyes allow
the newborn baby to focus on the face, and the focal length of the eyes at birth is
roughly the distance between the baby’s face and the mother’s when being breastfed.
Moreover, faces play a dual role in social interaction: they hold us together as
members of a common humanity who can communicate with each other as a social
species through our faces, and they mark our individuality. We are the same, and we
are different. Pareidolia is a psychological phenomenon whereby meaning is read
into seemingly random, chance, phenomena. Human characteristics, such as faces,
may be read into things.
There is considerable alarm about the use of facial recognition technologies. Why
might this be? Much of this is focused on its inaccuracy and its use to target and
control workers, political prisoners, and for surveillance of those deemed at risk of
criminality or anti-social behaviour [70]. Some potential uses concern ‘reading’
emotions from facial expressions, also subject to criticism for various reasons,
including the lack of grounding for claims that particular emotions can be attributed
based upon certain expressions [71]. The past history of phrenology and its lamen-
table attempts to categorise people and spot ‘traits’ such as criminality has been
drawn upon as analogous to current proposed uses of facial recognition technology
[72]. There could be some concrete beneﬁts, for example, if the recognition of facial
expressions was used as part of technology to detect tiredness in drivers [73]. Yet
there may be particular concern about how AI might control us. For example, a
proposed use of facial recognition technology in autonomous vehicles to detect
emotions given information about where the person is going: the wrong kind of
emotion or expression for a date, or for a job interview, could be met with ‘appro-
priate’ music to get the person in the ‘right’ frame of mind [74]. The implications for
social control and for the uniformity of such technology hardly need to be spelled out
and indeed have attracted considerable attention [75].
Exercise 18
If an AI gathered data about you from your facial expressions or used facial
recognition technology to identify you as an individual, does this seem any different
qualitatively from gathering a similar amount of data about you, or identifying you
via other means? Can you give any reasons for your answer? Don’t worry if you
can’t. That alone is an interesting ﬁnding.
8.7.5
Autonomy
We have already mentioned the notion of autonomy at various points. The concept
of autonomy is closely tied to ways of valuing the person: on a commonly accepted

view, a person is someone who is assumed to possess autonomy, and respecting the
autonomous decisions and actions of a person is one major way in which respect for
persons may be accomplished. It is a key value, along with freedom, frequently cited
in guidance concerning AI ethics (see Sect. 2.4.1). We have also discussed the
question of moral autonomy and its use in the work of Kant (see Sect. 1.2) and the
different ways in which autonomy might be understood in different contexts (see
Sect. 4.1.3). The question of control in AI may be seen to be disrupting issues of
autonomy and changing possibilities and patterns of control of individual lives,
constraining and creating dangers in some respects, enabling and enhancing auton-
omy in other respects, and changing patterns of distribution of freedom and auton-
omy often in complex ways.
352
8
Persons and AI
The general idea of autonomy is readily grasped, although it should be noted that
autonomy is understood philosophically in different ways, the importance of differ-
ent elements of autonomy may be variably stressed, and autonomy is one value
among many. Its relative value may be viewed differently, especially in different
cultures. Note the value of solidarity (see Sect. 2.4.10), which may be somewhat in
opposition to the value of individual autonomy.
Autonomy and control by others An elementary account of autonomy may be
simply one of freedom and power to do as one wishes, within the boundaries of
physical possibility. Indeed, control by others is generally seen as a constraint on
autonomy. If my data are being collected in ways of which I am not fully aware and
used to market to me a product I would not otherwise have bought, this interferes
with my autonomy (but then, the product may increase my autonomy, depending on
what it is!). It is the capacity of AI to enable certain people vastly increased powers
of control over others, which is a major ethical concern. However, control by others
per se may not be a problematic attack on autonomy. For we are social creatures,
living among each other, and others may have legitimate demands upon us, although
there will be large differences between what demands are seen as legitimate or not.
Indeed, the notion of autonomy as a value focused upon ‘the individual’ has
received much critique. Concepts of ‘relational autonomy’ have been developed
[76], recognising that we develop our autonomy, our sense of individual self, only in
relation to others (as various accounts of ‘wolf children’ who have survived in the
wild have conﬁrmed) [77]. An ideal of autonomy thus needs to incorporate our social
natures, the legitimate concerns and needs of others, and strike a balance between
individual freedom and control, and the reality of our shared and entangled lives.
Exercise 19
If you have a Neuralink implant, or similar, which connects your brain directly to the
Internet, are your decisions and thoughts still yours? [N.B. this is a thought exper-
iment only! Don’t get a brain implant just to answer the question!]
If you are connected to the Internet indirectly through the use of a smartphone that
you carry with you at all times, are your decisions and thoughts still yours?
Likewise, the idea of autonomy as limitless freedom to do as we wish is
inconsistent with those accounts of ethics that consider there are only certain ways

of living that will lead to ‘the good life’. (Recall, in contrast, our discussion of the
sceptical view of ethics as rules imposed from the outside, understood as little other
than constraints. See Sect. 1.6) Aristotelean accounts of ethics and the notion of
eudaimonia should make this clear (see, e.g. Sect. 1.6). We have also seen how, for
Kant, autonomy involves adherence to the moral law, which is a demand of reason.
Since we are rational agents, we see and recognise these demands and hence fulﬁl
our natures, rather than act against them, in acting out of respect for the moral law.
One need not accept Kant’s views completely to agree that following something we
ourselves recognise as value is not in conﬂict with autonomy, whereas acting against
our core values may well be.
8.7
The Limits and Boundaries of Persons
353
Of course, problems remain: identifying what these values are. The possibilities
of control by AI include the potential manipulation of information, desire, and
emotion, which perhaps poses an added problem in determining if our autonomy
is being threatened.
Exercise 20
Surveillance by others and the possible manipulation that might result may seem
straightforwardly to be an attack on our autonomy. It is an increasing possibility as
the use of AI and surveillance technologies are built into our lives. Given that we are
social creatures and given that we each generally fall short of perfect ethical and
socially acceptable behaviour, feedback on our behaviour from others is a constant
of human life and essential for the development of good moral character. Con-
versely, we are subject to social pressure, to social conformity, and to groupthink.
Consider how AI may play a role in this, and whether there are ways of using and
increasing surveillance, monitoring, or sharing of data with others via AI that might
be socially valuable, that may not threaten our autonomy, and may even enhance
it. This is a multifaceted question since so many factors and complex technologies
are involved. Different answers may be given for different kinds of surveillance
technology and for the context of use.
Constraints and possibilities produced by AI We would not normally think our
autonomy was threatened by the inability to do things that are physically impossible.
I wish I could ﬂy over the trees as birds do, but my autonomy is not threatened by my
lack of capacity to do so. However, when it comes to social, political, and economic
possibilities presented to different individuals and groups, we think differently. The
responses one has to this will vary according to different social and political beliefs,
but it is certainly the case that AI is changing this landscape greatly. The ‘digital
divide’ may mean that those without access to technologies or with access but
without the requisite skills and facilities to use it are having possibilities constrained
by the increasing adoption of AI in society [78]. We may ﬁnd that the ways in which
we relate to each other are changed by technologies in profound ways through
multiple means with results that we may never have wished for and ﬁnd hard to
control [79]. The possibilities created by technology may also paradoxically increase
the ways in which a person’s autonomy may be curtailed, by adding new possibil-
ities to which a person may not have access. I don’t think my autonomy is
constrained by not being able to ﬂy like a bird, but I may feel it is constrained if

despite my best efforts I can’t earn enough to take an airplane ﬂight, or if I am
banned from boarding because the facial recognition system at the airport mistakenly
identiﬁes me as a wanted criminal. If every time I ﬂy, I get ﬂagged by security
because I fall foul of proﬁling methods and get interrogated, I may feel my autonomy
is somewhat curtailed even if this just delays my departure by a short time.
354

Among the new possibilities that technology creates may be the prospect of
transcending limits we once simply accepted. Moreover, technology may dangle
projected possibilities in front of us, such that we may not know if we are on the
verge of missing out on something splendid. We have to grapple with the question of
how far to push limits. As we have indicated, striving towards goals is an inherent
part of being a person, and overcoming obstacles may form a key part of a valuable
life, as may quietly accepting the path in life one has been allotted.
8.7.6
Privacy
We have already discussed privacy at various points. The collection, analysis, and
use of data upon which so much AI depends has made privacy a key value in AI
ethics and a central topic of much intense study [80]. The sheer scale of data
collected, the capacity of analysis, and the ubiquity of data collection all create
challenges for privacy. As we have also seen, developments in science and in
technology can produce shifts in how we conceptualise data as personal, ‘belonging’
in some way to the individual (see Sect. 4.3.1). At the same time, our collective and
individual use of technology, including sharing information, is moulding and chang-
ing attitudes towards privacy often in seemingly conﬂicting, shifting, and confusing
ways [81].
An inﬂuential model of privacy by Helen Nissenbaum describes privacy as
contextual integrity; norms of privacy concerning the gathering and dissemination
of information should provide appropriate and adequate protection, given the par-
ticular context [82, 83]. With contexts changing so much, and frequently requiring
complex analysis to understand exactly what is happening with personal informa-
tion, privacy may be yet another example of how our uses of technology are shifting
attitudes towards the very thing we wish and need to assess, even as we are in the
throes of doing so.
The topic of privacy also exempliﬁes the tendencies towards diametrically
opposed responses: on the one hand, the claims that privacy is dead and perhaps
not to be mourned [84] and on the other hand, the intense concern to maintain
privacy and attention to steps to ensure this [85]. In reality, we have never had
limitless privacy, and meanwhile, nobody yet knows what tune I am currently
humming to myself in my head. (At least, I don’t think they do.) This short section
aims to indicate how privacy needs to be understood in relation to the person, the
individual, and hence its ethical concerns in relation to AI are closely intertwined
with those of the person. Likewise, although the ways in which we think about

privacy are steeped in general and rather abstract ideas of the value we accord and
respect to individuals, privacy is also individually and culturally sensitive, and
closely linked to our particular human embodiment.
8.8
Key Points
355
Many animals have a sense of privacy and may be highly territorial. Some
animals may seek privacy to give birth or to go when they are sick or dying. The
subjectivity of our experience means that we are ‘trapped’ as it were, in our own
inner worlds, but likewise, some freedom from the prying eyes of others seems to
most of us a psychological necessity. This may even be a development necessity,
especially as we form our own identities during adolescence. However, there will be
large cultural and individual differences here. One only needs to travel to different
countries to notice differences in how domains of privacy and intimacy are
maintained. Again, as with so much of ethical and social import, the balance between
the individual and the social group is at issue. There will always be certain limits to
privacy, partly because of the legitimate demands of society (whatever they are) and
partly because, unless you somehow disappear into a basement never to be seen or
heard from again, certain facts about you can be discerned just by looking and
listening.
Violations of privacy may matter for a variety of reasons. They can permit control
by others but may also be associated with feelings such as shame. For example,
individuals can feel violated and experience shame by the spread of deepfake porn
involving their image, even if it is not actually their own naked body shown
[86]. However, the question of privacy in relation to AI does not simply concern
privacy violation. We also need to consider the growth of methods individuals can
use to maintain their own privacy. We might include in this the ways in which so
much technology, aided by economic and commercial changes, enables us to live
remotely from each other.
Exercise 21
Early in this chapter, we mentioned the question of the LaMDA language model and
the question of whether it might have attained sentience. Given what you have
learned and considered in this chapter, outline why opposing views might be taken
on this matter, and try to explain the gulfs between different positions.
8.8
Key Points
The concept of a person is a key notion with profound ethical implications, yet it is
variously understood. There are cultural, historical, and philosophical variations in
how persons are understood and valued.
This produces complexity when examining questions about the treatment of
persons. One hallmark of poor treatment is often taken to be violation of respect
for persons, failure to see persons as such and to treat them as such. But these may
reﬂect different ways of understanding persons, the value of the individual versus the
social, and the boundaries between persons and other things.

356
8
Persons and AI
AI raises a plethora of ethical issues concerning persons. These include the
question of whether AI may attain elements of personhood and whether our use of
technologies enhances or degrades respect for persons.
The development and ideology behind AI may also present challenges to the
notion of the individual person. New ways of understanding ourselves, relations with
others, and ways of understanding the boundaries of what is possible for persons
may all work towards changing how we understand what it is to be an individual
person.
Ways in which AI is used and in which we ourselves use AI, such as using it to
track data about the self, may radically or subtly alter how we understand ourselves
and our capabilities.
Is a notion of an indivisible and separate individual person coherent and valid? As
indicated, it does not seem to be an idea universally accepted in human culture, at
least not in its most stark form as an atomistic sovereign individual. In addition, there
may be ways in which our use of AI, and ways in which we think about AI, may
undermine and cast doubts on this concept. However, it is a core concept, for
example, being used in notions of universal human rights and as part of campaigns
for civil rights.
Different philosophical accounts of the relationship between mind and body form
a backdrop to questions of personhood. The difﬁculties and attractions of different
accounts are helpful in coming to understand the seeming intractability of conﬂicting
ways of understanding persons. Subjectivity and some notion of embodiment are
both implicated yet hard to reconcile.
On some accounts, there is a continuum between persons and things, including
machines. On other accounts, there is a sharp conceptual and moral gulf.
Hallmarks of personhood may include rationality, agency, and consciousness, but
these on their own are not enough. Possession of a sense of self, purpose, and
signiﬁcance may be necessary.
Personhood may be conceptualised in ways that lead to the attribution of person-
hood or mind to computers, at least in theory. However, some accounts of person-
hood stress the cognitive may have deleterious consequences for certain groups.
A key issue in accounts of personhood is whether they are unduly reductive,
reducing persons to ‘nothing but’ (ﬁll in the dots), or whether there is something
about persons that distinctively marks them off from other agents and from things.
8.9
Educator Notes
A challenge of this chapter is for students to understand the issue that the notion of a
person is important to ethics, yet understood in different ways, and possibly is being
challenged or altered in various ways by how we think about and use AI, as well as
understanding that in different cultures, ideologies, and at different times of history,
the idea of a person has been understood in various ways. Introducing students to the
importance of the notion of equal treatment for persons as a political concept useful

in the ﬁght for civil rights yet nonetheless challenging to conceptualise may be
useful.

Students who respond better to or prefer a more focused practical approach could
use ideas from this chapter to focus on the question of sentience in the LaMDA
language model, and why some were inclined to consider the possibility of person-
hood and others ﬁrmly rejected this. Section 8.7 could be used as a stand-alone
section, which while including theory, also focuses on practical issues, since stu-
dents will doubtless have some notion of personhood and will still derive value from
the exercises.
However, it is also important for students to be able to grasp and articulate some
of the ways in which AI may be used in ways that undermine (or promote) respect for
persons and may change how we see ourselves and see and relate to others as
persons.
Students with less time could simply be set Sects. 8.2 and 8.3 which deal with
accounts of the person focusing on Kant and Dennett. This would provide a good
amount of material for discussion. The addition of Sect. 8.6 discussing Taylor’s
division of two contrasting approaches to personhood, the scientiﬁc and the moral, is
somewhat more advanced but may also be useful in helping students understand
some reasons why this issue may be so intractable.
Section 8.5 may provide good material for a discussion in class where students
may be challenged to think through how the concept of personhood is applied and
attributed in challenging real life cases.
Debate and project or essay topics This topic would provide material for great
discussions between those with knowledge of different disciplines, such as anthro-
pology, theology, psychology, and computing, who should between them have
diverse notions of the nature of a person and how persons are valued.
Exercises 9, 10, 14, 20, and 21 may be particularly suitable for class debate and
discussion or for essays and extended projects.
Later chapters will provide more material on the question of AI and personhood.

Individuals, Society, and AI: Online
Communication
Abstract This chapter examines a current ethical issue in AI, using the example of
online content moderation and consolidating previous material. The problem of
online harms is in tension with values of freedom of expression. Freedom of
expression is a perennial issue. We consider how the use of technology may impact
and exacerbate the problems and examine the possibilities of using technology to
address them, such as the challenges of using algorithms to detect nuanced meaning.
The ethical issues are tightly connected to wider political, social, regulatory, and
legal issues. Here, we focus on ethics while also discussing how wider interests from
government and industry may skew debates and solutions. The issue of free speech
is outlined, drawing on the claims of John Stuart Mill and the ‘harm principle’ as a
limit to free speech. We also address issues in the philosophy of language, consid-
ering how meaning and intention are related and the critical importance of context,
drawing on the work of H. P. Grice. We consider how communication online may
impact views of self and others and consider how both the problems of online
content and the attempts to ﬁnd solutions may inﬂuence how we understand and
address ethical questions.

Introduction
Summary
This chapter uses the example of the moderation of online content that is deemed
harmful by human moderators and in particular by algorithms in the illustration of a
complex ethical issue currently facing us. Problems of online content moderation
raise complex ethical issues concerning factors such as responsibility, agency,
freedom of expression, and protection from harm, which also intersect legal, polit-
ical, economic, and societal concerns.

Individuals, Society, and AI: Online Communication
The remaining chapters look more centrally at concrete issues and apply and extend
ideas and material we have covered previously. This chapter examines a cluster of
current problems, taking one example as a central theme: language and communi-
cation through technology, in particular, focusing on content moderation online for
alleged hate speech, online harms, and misinformation, with the main focus on the
notion of ‘online harms’. We aim additionally to tease out some general themes and
questions that will be relevant for a range of other issues. The objective is not to give
an account of what ‘the’ answer is, (or even what ‘the’ issues are, since these are
many and may be understood in different and contested ways). It is to analyse at least
some elements of the typical ethical questions that arise regarding AI, provide some
tools to start to address them, indicate how the ethical questions intersect with other
issues, and hence enhance and promote dialogue.
Why pick this theme? As we shall see, questions around the spread of online
content and its moderation raise issues with profound ethical, social, and political
implications, which concern both society as a whole and individuals. The ever-
present question of how to ‘strike a balance’ or otherwise deal with ethical tensions
between the individual and society (including especially in this case, various sub-
groups in societies, and issues between different societies, jurisdictions, and cul-
tures) is certainly central here, and it is a theme that is often heightened by the use of
AI as perceived responsibilities are apparently shifted. Since the topic concerns
communication, it immediately involves the central ethical questions of how we
relate to each other, see ourselves, and see and respond to the world at large. There
are issues concerning the behaviour, responsibilities, and obligations of govern-
ments, of corporations, and of individuals. The ethical questions thus go far beyond a
narrow domain of individual ethics per se, extending into questions of culture, of
political and legal obligations, and of possible remedies, hence meaning that the
topic also acts as a good illustration of the intimate interactions between ethics,
politics, law, and culture. I will not pretend to tackle all of these issues here; there are
a myriad complex and highly detailed legal, technical, and regulatory issues which
are beyond the scope of this book; but understanding of broad ethical questions are
relevant to understanding and entering into dialogue about the further details and
practical solutions.
The ethical questions of online content and its moderation also raise technical
issues requiring detailed understanding of the nuts and bolts of the technology, both
software and hardware, and its governance. These include the issue of bias in
algorithms and the use of natural language processing to detect meaning. Questions
of the ideology and attitudes driving how the issues and potential solutions are
understood and presented are ever-present. We will also ask how the use of AI and
our responses to its use may be shaping the social landscape and how it might be
changing perceptions and behaviour. Naturally, such a question has a highly empir-
ical component and concerns complex webs of behaviour and meaning. The issues
may be rather polarised, with competing values pointing in different directions, and
even were the abstract questions of value to be broadly resolved, there are complex
questions about how best to achieve a good ethical result in practice. What is new on
the block, and how might AI be raising new ethical issues or recycling old ones?

9.1
Introduction
365
We will see that the issues can be framed and solutions can be sought in very
different ways and with different outcomes, from different perspectives, with differ-
ent emphases on conﬂicting values (such as harm reduction and the value of free
speech and individual expression). This chapter also examines how approaches from
various normative ethical theories contrast with respect to these issues and aims to
show how philosophical claims, for example, regarding the nature of language and
of knowledge, come into play.
9.1.1
Moderating Online Content: An Overview
We begin with an overview of the area to be explored in this chapter. The questions
concerning how AI impacts communication online are far reaching; to illustrate the
topic and provide some speciﬁcity, some of the material on which this chapter draws
refers to particular proposals, under discussion at the time of writing, regarding the
moderation of online content in the UK through proposed changes to the law in what
had been called ‘online harms’ at consultation stage, but which became the draft
‘Online Safety Bill’ [1]. This is used to illustrate general issues and to provide an
example of some possible ways of understanding and addressing the issues. There is
also sound a reason for considering the proposals made from a speciﬁc jurisdiction:
the impact that these may have globally, given the global nature of online commu-
nications. This has already been made manifest, for example, in the adoption of
General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) within the European Union, which has
had an impact on those within the EU accessing material from outside it, and those
outside the EU who wish their material to be accessible within it.
Indeed, such pressures may form one motivation for jurisdictions racing to
become a leader in regulations simply because then one may have greater inﬂuence
over those who follow, who may then tend to run in the tracks that one jurisdiction
has created [2]. This can also have an impact upon one’s success in developing
technologies.
What are the issues? Those who have paid attention especially to Chap. 4 will I
hope immediately be saying to themselves, ‘Aha, but it all depends upon how
precisely the case is described!’ Yes, indeed it does. There has been considerable
attention and scholarship to the question of how to understand the media and its
possibilities [3–5]. But we can in broad outline identify the issues to start our
discussion, although what can be covered here will be far from complete. Nothing
could delight me more for readers to ﬁnd additional material, points of concern, and
different approaches to the matters. In considering the matter and in working through
cases and exercises, exploring other ways of describing issues and further
unexplored features is always vital.
The possibilities of online communication Communication online can take many
forms. Of course, not all of this involves much in the way of AI per se; some of the
communication may be as relatively simple as posting a blog on a website. Indeed, as

we shall see, many of the problems stem not from the use of very sophisticated AI
but from the use of algorithms that promise much but that perhaps deliver less.
Nonetheless, the affordances of technology enable certain modes of communication
and new, or seemingly new, and altered possibilities. Features of how the online
world operates and how people behave and respond online may increase the
possibility of concerns about ‘online harms’. Social media enables material to be
posted which can quickly garner a wide and even global audience. Much material
can be posted anonymously; conversely, the identities of individuals may be
revealed or quickly surmised or hacked. The anonymity rendered possible online
removes the disincentive of detection and social shame; the lack of anonymity can
conversely ruin reputations and spread social shame, much of it undeserved. Mate-
rial may be posted without much thought, reactions may be heated, and interactions
helpful, or aggressive, sometimes intentionally hurtful. Content may be posted
without consent, as in revenge porn. ‘Filter bubbles’ are also highlighted: the
tendency of our interactions online to be with increasingly homogenous groups of
people and sets of ideas [6], although note that there has been work critically
examining the idea of ﬁlter bubbles [7]. This is often aided by the algorithms driving
online suggestions for viewing content and also by other factors, such as the ease of
blocking people.

Individuals, Society, and AI: Online Communication
Many features of social media are purposively designed to ensure as much
engagement as possible. Since social media platforms rely upon advertiser revenue,
it is in their interests to maximise online engagement in whatever form it takes. The
reactions that keep us engaged are often among humanity’s less admirable traits:
anger and outrage can keep users engaged and reacting very strongly [8]. The
capacities of social media enable phenomena such as the group pile-on, where an
individual may be the recipient of a large amount of material from hundreds,
thousands, or even more people, many of whom will be strangers, and many or
most of whom will be anonymous. This all can happen across national borders.
Moreover, it is possible to post material without checking its veracity, to post
material knowing that it is false or misleading and to post deepfakes, AI generated
images or video that convincingly appears to be real.
Some of this material has attracted considerable concern under the heading of
‘online hate’, or more generally of abusive or harmful content. There has been
considerable concern about misleading information online, and much of this concern
has come from governments, especially in the wake of allegations of elections and of
issues affecting the public, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. The harms and social
and psychological effects of the spread and ready accessibility of online pornogra-
phy, much of it increasingly extreme, are also too complex to cover here. There is
also much material online that is plainly illegal, such as material pertaining to
terrorism, child pornography, and material related to illegal drug use and selling
and human trafﬁcking. Intentionally targeted harassment at individuals or groups is
also clearly illegal under many jurisdictions. There are rightly issues to be debated
concerning how best to deal with such illegal material (and indeed, whether certain
material should be illegal), but we are not focusing on them here, partly because of

their complexity, but mostly because the ethical issues of dealing with the vaguer
concepts of online harm or online hate will raise some particular philosophical
questions. The interesting and more perplexing questions concern how to deal
with the issues of material which seems to pose certain harms, but which is not in
itself illegal, and which may appear to present us with novel difﬁculties, or certainly,
with difﬁculties created by the sheer scale of online material.
9.1
Introduction
367
Freedom of expression Alongside these very real concerns for those on the
receiving end of online hate, there are legitimate concerns for the impact on freedom
of expression that might arise from attempts to address this issue. One reason for
concern over online hate is how ubiquitous the online world has become in our lives.
Thus, conversely, we must be mindful of the impact of attempts to control online
discourse, given the centrality of this discourse to how we access information and
communicate. Are we heading for authoritarian control over how we access infor-
mation and express ourselves online? (Again, dimensions of such questions are
clearly empirical and require understanding of actual patterns of communication.)
The background of societal concerns Proposals for the moderation of online
content ﬁt into prior issues in society regarding the spreading of information and
misinformation, including standards and expectation of truth telling, laws around
libel and slander, and laws and standards around harassment of individuals. More-
over, in more recent years, many jurisdictions have introduced the notion of ‘hate
speech’ and ‘hate crime’, in particular concerning those who fall into a protected
group such as one based on race, ethnicity, sex, sexual orientation, or disability.
Hence, some of the material of concern online would be classed as illegal in some
jurisdictions. Other material online violates the terms and conditions of the platforms
on which it is posted. Proposals for dealing with these questions may give greater
obligations to social media companies for detecting and removing or otherwise
dealing with ‘problematic’ content.
Current proposals in the UK target content online which is not illegal yet is
considered ‘harmful to adults’ [1]. Proposals include the use of algorithms to detect
and monitor language online. Methods will rely upon the use of algorithms to ﬂag
online content, supervised by human moderators, and with a process of user com-
plaints to allow for redress in cases of dispute. Anybody overseeing this may have
considerable powers of discretion over what content is ﬂagged and how it is dealt
with, and over how complaints are dealt with. The proposals in the UK at the time of
writing, which are used here as an example, propose that the broadcast regulator
Ofcom, which is a statutory corporation reporting regularly to Parliament, is given
oversight, with considerable powers of discretion.
Issues raised thus can immediately be seen to include the restriction or censorship
of content that is not illegal; the background of any legal deﬁnition of content that is
disallowed within the jurisdiction in question; how the notion of ‘harm’ is under-
stood; the apportioning of responsibilities for taking action; questions of free speech
and censorship; control by governments and by corporations; individual responsi-
bilities online; and the means used to achieve these ends, including the accuracy or

otherwise of algorithms, and questions of transparency around their use. Other issues
include the use of AI with intent to bring about good, the use of AI for malevolent
purposes, and our capacity to tell the difference.

What Concepts and Tools Can We Bring to These
Questions?
Summary
This section reviews some of the concepts and strategies that readers may bring in
addressing ethical questions about online content.
Let us brieﬂy review some of our earlier material and how it might be brought to bear
on this issue. What relevant questions might need to be asked, what concepts,
theories, and strategies should be drawn upon? You might wish to stop and consider
how you would go about addressing these questions before continuing. It may be
useful to browse the ‘Key Points’ from each chapter. Indeed, the list of potential
considerations is very long. Let us just pick a few from each of the chapters.
What is my speciﬁc contribution? Consider what particular experience and
knowledge you have on which to draw. Perhaps, for example, you have detailed
knowledge of how particular social media accounts operate, or have personal
experience of being targeted by, or accused of, problematic content online (Chap. 1).
Novelty and precedents Consider how new these issues are. Are there any histor-
ical precedents? (‘Yes’, is the easy answer to this, in terms of questions about
censorship and free speech, among others.) So what precisely might be different?
Consider what key ethical values commonly found in codes of ethics may be
involved, which ones are most important, and how we might need to interpret
each within this particular context, for example, autonomy, transparency, fairness,
responsibility, and privacy (Chap. 2).
How the technology is understood How does the way in which we see the
technologies concerned shape our understanding of human involvement? Might
our use of technology and assumptions about it shape how we draw boundaries
around concepts and how we understand certain values? Consider how technology
may shape how we communicate and how ideas spread (Chap. 3).
How the story is told Consider how a situation is described, who is involved, and
in particular, how causation and agency are portrayed. Consider if certain assump-
tions are being made about our capacity to resolve ethical situations. Consider if the
technologies under issue here may have impacted human behaviour and thought in
ways that may shape ethical issues and ways of resolving them. The question of how
a story is told will be especially pertinent to how we describe disputes between
different parties and contentious communications online (Chap. 4).

9.3
Why Is AI Being Used to Address the Online Harms Question?
369
What you don’t know Consider what you don’t know that you need to ﬁnd out,
and where to get this information (Chap. 4).
Knowledge Look out for any assumptions regarding the value of knowledge, of
information, and of data and the values involved in sharing and communicating
knowledge, information, or data (Chap. 5).
Our human frailties Consider what picture of human nature may underlie discus-
sions of these ethical issues, in particular any ﬂaws humans are presumed to manifest
(Chap. 5).
Normative ethical theories Think about how a focus on the outcomes of actions
may contrast with a focus upon issues of agency and/or character. Questions about
the interpretation of rules will be especially vital in assessing the appropriate use of
algorithms, especially in complex contexts of meaning. Consider what virtues and
vices might apply to communication online (Chap. 6).
Attention to the world Consider how the technology involved here might impact
our attention. Consider how knowledge and reality are represented and valued and
consider what underlying model of language applies (Chap. 7).
Self, person, agency Consider how the uses and abuses of the technologies in
question here may impact our ideas of ourselves and of how we relate to others.
Consider how agency is attributed and possibly distributed between humans and
machines (Chap. 8).
Last, I wish to stress that this is not intended as a ‘check list’ of the steps one must
simply follow to get the ‘right’ answer. Ethics is more complex than that, and some
situations will require more, some will require emphasis on certain factors, some
situations may occasionally be resolved quite readily.
9.3
Why Is AI Being Used to Address the Online Harms
Question?
Summary
In assessing the use of AI, it is important to consider why AI is being used, what is
expected of it, and why it is used rather than humans; if we do not do this, we may
assume that AI is the best approach and overlook that any assessment needs to
include comparison with alternatives. This necessitates a thorough analysis of what
task(s) the AI is charged to perform.
We are considering the use of AI in the form of algorithms to detect content, in order
to address an issue that originates in or is magniﬁed by technology. Even though the
use of algorithms may seem entirely necessary, it can be useful in addressing any
question in ethics to parse apart the different reasons why AI is being used. There are
a range of reasons why we might use AI in such settings. These include the speed at

which AI may operate; the complexity of calculations needed; the capacities of
perception, for example, in image reading; the (alleged) consistency and efﬁciency
of AI; the capacity for scale; the tedium of the task for human workers; the cost of
human labour; the shortage of human labour; or priorities to spend time on other
things. The unsuitability of some tasks for humans is another factor: the use of
robotics for dangerous work such as landmine clearance seems a clear win for
humanity. Other tasks may be mentally or psychologically draining, and content
moderation can fall into this class, owing both to the nature of much online material
and to the potential for human moderators to receive abuse [9, 10]. The content
moderators are not content.

Why is it useful to consider precisely why AI is being used? We may ﬁnd that its
use is simply presumed to be better than relying on human capacity and that looking
carefully at the reasons for its use and the presumed beneﬁts may lead us to adjust
our views on the wisdom of preferring AI to human labour. We may gain insights
into the background conditions that led to its use and its preference to human labour.
We may ﬁnd that assumptions about the superiority of AI within a particular context
lead to an idealised version of AI being used for comparison with human labour.
Consider the examples we have seen so far regarding the use of AI in relation to
people living with dementia. These include the power of data gathering and analysis,
including perceptual capacities, in the use of AI for diagnostics (and also for
developing treatments) [11]. AI may be faster, more consistent, and have capacities
that humans do not have. Added to the reasons for using AI, we must ensure that we
include the scale and seriousness of the issue that grounds and justiﬁes the devel-
opment of appropriate AI, the numbers overall and the numbers undiagnosed, and
the failures to develop effective treatments. Economic factors are also generally
present. Without the factors of importance and urgency, putting effort into develop-
ing AI may be low down on a list of priorities, although conversely, adopting
solutions from simple application of AI for less valued tasks for economic reasons
is also prevalent. Hence, the reasons for using AI are not merely technical. However,
any use of AI must also be cognizant of potential dangers that might come alongside
beneﬁts. We must also remember that any endeavour in science and technology is
prone to error and correction [12].
Consider now the use of AI in assistance for people living with dementia, such as
help with everyday tasks, monitoring for safety and companionship, or surveillance
to prevent wandering. In such cases, technology is largely used simply for the lack of
humans to fulﬁl these tasks. The complex causes behind this include demographics,
the rate of dementia in the population, the distances that family members may live
from each other, the demands of the workplace, general attitudes towards elderly
individuals, the difﬁculty of recruiting paid human carers, or preference for automa-
tion in some cases (recall the very different attitudes towards robots in some
cultures). Multiple interlocking economic, social, and cultural forces will underlie
all of these factors. The use of AI cannot be understood without understanding the
complex societal backdrop, the very complexity of which will mean that opinions
and analysis are likely to be variable. Assumptions about what can and cannot be

changed, what is desirable to be changed, and other means of addressing the issue
may all prove fruitful routes of exploration.
9.3
Why Is AI Being Used to Address the Online Harms Question?
371
It is helpful to consider why AI is used, rather than humans, and whether AI is
replacing humans, or enhancing or extending human capabilities, and what trade-
offs there may be. This comparative element in assessing the use of AI means that
the question is never merely technical.
Task analysis This then means that we need to have a good analysis of what
precisely the task involves so that we can consider if AI has been a good replacement
or supplement to human labour. This task analysis may be complex. We need to
consider whether the AI in question is technically adequate for the task, how the task
is described, and how the situation to be addressed came about. In regard to roles
ﬁlled by paid employees, for example, we might need to consider that many of the
most important tasks undertaken by human beings may not be on any ofﬁcial job
description. It is not in the job description of the person serving at your local store to
ask solicitously if you found your lost cat yet, but it certainly makes your day if they
do this. In any task that involves replacing humans entirely, we need to ask if the AI
in question can fully replicate the aspects of human agency, and if appropriate, of the
human person. Conversely, there may be aspects of some tasks that involve distinc-
tively human responses, for which very reason we prefer to use AI because of the toll
on human beings—content moderation of extreme content online being one such
example.
In other words, we sometimes need AI to operate like humans in relevant ways,
but we sometimes require AI to omit human elements.
It can be useful to compare and contrast cases of AI that involve elements of
robotics or mimicry of the human or the personiﬁed (e.g., in the use of a dog avatar
for companionship and safety monitoring of people living with dementia that we
considered in Sect. 2.4.9) with cases of AI that are simply embedded in computing
because the former may lead us to comparisons with human agency and personhood,
which we might have overlooked in the latter. A tension, possibly a paradox, in some
uses of AI is that replication of elements of human agency may be needed to fulﬁl the
task adequately but has its own dangers. We considered earlier whether humans are
kept out of decision-making entirely or kept in the loop or on the loop (see Sect. 2.3).
Humans may be needed as an essential part of the process or brought in when the
process seems to go awry or some redress is needed.
Exercise 1
In the case of something like diagnostics, the task of the AI is focused on ﬁnding and
delivering information. Is there any element of distinctively human agency or
personality involved in this? You may wish to review Exercises 4 and 11 from
Chap. 2.
Hint: consider how medical expertise and clinical judgement form over the
years [13].
Consider also the location of the diagnostics: in the clinic, where the information
is mediated through medical personnel, or directly in the hands of patients.

Location, location, location This exercise raises the issue that it is not simply the
technical capabilities of AI that matter: it is the context of use. The many features of
the location of communication, that it is online, are going to be highly relevant.

Content Moderation for Online Harms: What Is
Needed?
Summary
To address the issue of online harms we need to describe the problem. We need to
note how different ways of seeing the issue may skew how the ethical issues are
presented, how the problems are seen to have arisen, and the roles of those involved
are understood. An overview of a defence of free speech is given, using the work of
John Stuart Mill. A commonly accepted exception to free speech is that speech must
not cause harm. Difﬁculties with giving an account of harm, including
misinformation as possible harm, are described. We need to consider the complex-
ities of inferring meaning from language.
It is proposed to use AI to ﬂag and remove or otherwise respond to content online
which is deemed harmful, abusive, illegal, or classiﬁed as misinformation or mis-
leading in some way. Here, we focus primarily on content that may be deemed
harmful (understood broadly and hence including a variety of possible harms) but
may not otherwise be illegal. To describe the task that the AI undertakes simply in
technical terms will omit many aspects that are essential to consider in understanding
how a situation came to be seen as of concern.
Exercise 2
Consider different ways in which the problems of online harms may be described,
what more information may be added, including elements of agency, who is
involved in this, and how they became involved. What is it that we are trying to
solve with the use of AI? You may wish to base this simply on your prior knowledge,
or do a little research on how the issues are presented in different contexts and by
different parties.
Consider the use of any value judgements in describing the situation to be
addressed.
Consider how far back in time we need to go to understand how the situation
came about.
If you are doing this as part of a class, it may be instructive to compare your
account with those of others.
It may be an interesting exercise to attempt to describe the situation using as
‘neutral’ language as possible and then consider if describing it using value terms or
emotionally loaded or judgemental terms might give a different view of matters. This
of course raises the question of what it is for language to be ‘neutral’, which is,
indeed, a central question for this topic.

9.4
Content Moderation for Online Harms: What Is Needed?
373
We can describe the issue in terms of addressing online content which ‘causes
harm’. Here, we discuss some of the issues that need to be teased out. This content is
described in ofﬁcial reports and in much general discourse as ‘online hate’ or ‘online
harms’. The proposed intervention of government agencies and the law is premised
upon claims that the issue is not adequately dealt with by current means, including
any control exercised by technology companies; the issue is presented as both
serious and as growing. The ethical issues are thus nested within political and
legal issues, since it raises the general question of the proper role of government,
especially when considering the wish to address content that does not break any
current laws (such laws include laws against libel and promoting terrorism and other
clearly illegal activities). This is thus a clear example of an ethical question where
political and wider social questions also need to be addressed.
This can be seen as an aspect of the ‘control’ question in AI: have new technol-
ogies created a situation that necessitates further government intervention in our
lives, where we are at the mercy of a tussle between governments and technology
companies for control over our discourse? Note how on some ways of looking at the
situation, the issue may be seen primarily as control by technologies; by companies
who develop and apply these technologies; by individuals and organised groups
making use of these technologies; or by governments. Note too that the claim that the
issue is both serious and growing ﬁts with tropes of technological progress (negative
tropes in this case), with tropes of fear of loss of control, yet accompanied by the
hopes that technology can, after all, address this tech-made problem; those working
in the ﬁeld often claim that attempts to deal with this by equipping individual users
of the online world with media literacy will be inadequate [14]. Others will disagree,
and it may be considered that where freedoms are in question, this may be more
important than ﬁnding the most technically proﬁcient solution.
Content and agency The issue to be dealt with can be described in terms of
tackling content online, but we can immediately see that a complex web of control,
agency, and responsibility is involved and that there are almost inevitably going to
be different ways of understanding this. This content is put there by humans, even if
it comes from a bot account: bots don’t make themselves. We can think of the
language (or images) involved as simply formal carriers of meaning, but we also
need to consider not only the formal properties of language but also language as
communication.
The problem(s) are implicitly or explicitly described in ways that attribute
responsibility and negative value judgements to those behind the content: that it is
malicious, intentional, or careless. Such people may be described as spreading fear,
hate, and abuse [15].
One way of looking at the problem of online hate Consider the extremes with
which AI is sometimes spoken: as ushering in a glorious future, of enabling us to
realise the greatest aspects of humanity; or as dooming us to a future of unimaginable
bleakness governed by technology (and, on some versions, manipulated or relegated
to second class citizens by its human overlords) if, that is, we even survive. The

actual problem here may be far more mundane and notable for its manifest grubbi-
ness. One of the challenges that content moderation involves is precisely sorting out
the entirely petty insult, the minor spat, from content deemed harmful.
374
9
Individuals, Society, and AI: Online Communication
Far from visions of a glorious and technologically sophisticated future, we are
pinning our hopes that some relatively simple algorithms may help us deal with the
embarrassing failures of humanity by acting as prefects to mean girls and bully boys.
Put like that, it’s almost comical. Unfortunately, however, it nonetheless raises some
serious and rather vexed issues. This is manifest if the issue is framed as concerning
our capacity to converse, access ideas, and the question of how our worldviews
might be shaped or manipulated; it is of course a pivotal one for humanity.
The causal stories behind accounts of the problems If we are to see the situation
adequately, and in particular, if we are to understand questions of agency and
responsibility, we must consider the wider context, including how situations arise,
in other words, an understanding of its history and the casual story that led to the
present case: both the general situation of concern about online hate and harms and
the particular situation behind speciﬁc instances.
Any history will also involve assumptions of value. For example, in describing
the casual accounts, wherever human beings are involved, we need to have some
understanding of the nature and degree of the agency of all the actors involved. What
are some of the issues?
First, how new are these issues? Some background. Unless we understand the
precedents, we may fail to see the full possibilities for understanding the nature of
the issue and may not search in the right place for remedies. We may assume that the
problem has been created by technology and thus should be solved via technology.
We may assume that if the problem is novel, since we assume that it is created by
new technology, and therefore can be solved in its entirety, since it did not exist prior
to the technology. Nonetheless, even if the problem is not new but is merely
ampliﬁed, this can cause a stepwise change in difﬁculty. If I ﬁnd one bed-bug and
kill it before it lays any eggs, this is a different matter to ﬁnding my entire house is
infested.
We can certainly see in this case that hurling abuse and slander at our fellows has
a long history and indeed is likely as old as civilisation. For example, the code of
Ur-Nammu, from approximately 2000 BCE, contains punishment for false witness
[16]. There is also a long history of punishing gossip.
Concern for freedom of expression may be historically somewhat newer but
nonetheless also has a long history. One solution to the problem of online harms
could be a high level of online censorship, for example, blocking any material that
may be potentially problematic, blocking accounts, and banning certain individuals.
However, even a less extreme response of censorship or blocking will be contro-
versial. Not only is this against central values in many places, there would be a
certain irony if the development and use of AI were to lead to the suppression of
ideas. This can be seen in (at least) two ways.

9.4
Content Moderation for Online Harms: What Is Needed?
375
One, consider the view of AI as discrete instances of technology exhibiting
aspects of intelligence. Since intelligence involves information, and since AI uses
and produces vast amounts of data and information, for AI technology to end up
hampering human capacity to communicate and share opinion and information
would be unfortunate indeed, a kind of an own goal.
Two, consider the view of AI as an attempt to reproduce human-level intelli-
gence, including perhaps consciousness and agency. For technology to have the
effects of encouraging the worst of human behaviour, then be used to curtail human
expression, interactions, communication, and liberty, would again be very unfortu-
nate. Hardly a utopian vision of a glorious future.
Exercise 3
Robin Wilton of the Internet Society has stated that the online world may amplify
certain problems but does not create them [17].
Do you agree? Consider as many different aspects of communication online as
possible.
Second, if problems are merely ampliﬁed, consider what that might mean for how
we address them.
Free Speech and Freedom of Expression: John Stuart Mill
Perhaps the most cited account of the value of freedom of speech comes from
John Stuart Mill in his work On Liberty, ﬁrst published in 1859 [18]. This is a
very strong defence of freedom of speech, but even Mill’s account includes
limits: the Harm Principle.
Mill argued that it should be possible to discuss any idea, even ones which
are immoral, and even ideas which have no other exponents. We should have
‘absolute freedom of opinion and sentiment on all subjects, practical or
speculative, scientiﬁc, moral or theological’ [18]. His reasoning behind this
includes the value accorded to individuals, and the value of knowledge,
including the value of understanding our own opinions. The value of opposing
opinions in a free society includes the way that being confronted with differ-
ence of opinion is a spark to ensure that one understands the justiﬁcation and
grounds for one’s own beliefs, which might otherwise grow stale if untested. A
broadly empiricist notion that we may ﬁnd we are wrong, and an open-ended
view of the gathering of knowledge, forms a background. Mill was aware that
society had great faults, that much was left to discover, and in addition, that
human nature as we ﬁnd it may be curtailed by circumstances including
societal pressures.
Note the values attached to knowledge and discussion here. The picture of
knowledge and of information is not simply of facts which we consider to
be true: the process of acquiring beliefs is critical. This is intimately tied to the
value given to individuals by Mill, since to accept something simply because it
(continued)

was received wisdom, or because a computer produced a result, might leave
one without understanding of the grounds of one’s beliefs.
376
9
Individuals, Society, and AI: Online Communication
Mill’s harm principle is, quite simply, that ‘the only purpose for which
power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community,
against his will, is to prevent harm to others’ [18]. Hence, free speech can only
be restricted if it causes harm. Note that the harm in question does not include
‘legitimate’ harms. For example, if someone correctly identiﬁed someone as
having abused others, and that person then suffered properly applied legal
penalties as a result, this would be legitimate. Simply causing offense to others
does not amount to the harm needed to restrict free speech.
Critically for our purposes, Mill noted that the place and the manner of
expression may be relevant. He argued that it is permissible to claim that corn
dealers starve the poor (by high prices) if this is stated in print; but to state this
to an angry mob outside the house of a corn dealer where a riot is likely to be
sparked, would not be permissible.
It will be apparent that there are many complex political, philosophical, legal, and
moral arguments regarding free speech and freedom of expression relevant to the
question of online harms. This brief introduction to Mill nonetheless opens up some
important issues.
Exercise 4
Consider Mill’s distinction between legitimate and illegitimate harms of free speech.
Find some examples of putative harm caused by free speech online and consider
whether this distinction is useful and, if so, how the line may be drawn.
Consider Mill’s example of inciting an angry mob outside the house of a corn
dealer by claiming that corn dealers starve the poor, compared to making this claim
in a newspaper. Is this distinction useful for considering online harms? How might
one distinguish different kinds of statements online?
Might one argue that the online world has brought the ‘angry mob’ closer the
house of the corn dealer?
9.4.1
Online Content: Who Is Involved?
The role of individuals So what might lie behind the online behaviours in ques-
tion? Note that there are two sides to the story, or more accurately, three or four:
those who post material, those who are the targets, and bystanders who happen to see
it (or actively seek it out), including those who see it and form opinions, or take
action as a result.
Many years ago, my sister made the rather sensible suggestion that computers should
be ﬁtted with breathalysers so that it was impossible to post comments, send emails,

or shop online while drunk. It would be authoritarian to impose this, but having it as
an option seems like an idea worth considering. Doubtless others have also thought
of this, and if they have, it will be because of multiple ﬂaws in human nature: lack of
judgement, impetuousness, and desires and urges pushing us in contrary directions.
Indeed, it’s only because we have these split natures that we even see this as a ﬂaw;
otherwise it would just be a description of who we are. Moreover, we are also highly
social animals, which means that we often care deeply about what others think of us,
and importantly, we care what other people think of other people. Reputation is
important in social interaction. We get much of our social cues as well as our
information from others.
9.4
Content Moderation for Online Harms: What Is Needed?
377
What are the features of the online world that might produce bad behaviour or
worsen it? We need to consider both those who post the material that is considered
problematic and those who consider this material problematic, since we must not
assume that all online content labelled as harmful or hateful merits that descriptor.
The possibilities of fast responses; the potential reach of many posts; the possibility
of anonymous posting; the loss of context of messages, including reach beyond
cultural and linguistic communities; the lack of accountability; the growing impor-
tance of one’s online presence and proﬁle; and the ease with which information on a
person may be found online are all some of the features that potentially together go to
produce these problems.
Exercise 5
Add any other relevant features to this list and consider, for each of these, differences
and similarities between the online world and the ofﬂine world. Notice the com-
plexities involved.
The role of corporations The technologies in question did not create themselves.
Behind the story of concerns about online behaviour are the corporations that
produce the technology, and that insert speciﬁc design features into it, and the
issue of how society, both individually and collectively, is responding. These
features may have been introduced with certain motives but will be likely to have
multiple effects. A key motivator is proﬁt and engagement. Structural issues in the
design of online platforms themselves are a major background cause of much of the
content that is presently under scrutiny. Persuasive technology is widely used in
order to foster engagement [19]. Users are encouraged to stay online by technology
that is designed to tap into our psychological weaknesses [8, 20]. Engagement is
especially critical where any proﬁts are generated through advertising revenues. We
also have to add to these wider social factors, such as the growing necessity of
communicating online; the very spread of technology makes it more and more of a
necessity.
Exercise 6: Food for Thought
Do proposals to use algorithms to detect online hate amount to using technology to
address problems caused by that very technology? If so, does this matter, and how?
What might the implications be for the attribution of responsibility?

378
9
Individuals, Society, and AI: Online Communication
It is clear that to understand the lines of agency, responsibility, and accountability
in creating the problems of online content and to investigate ways of ameliorating the
situation, we need to consider social and political science, as well as economics and
psychology, in addition to careful consideration of the details of different design
features. This is clearly an area where ethics must work hand in hand with detailed
knowledge of technology, design, actual patterns of usage, as well as many other
complex and related features of human behaviour and interaction.
Exercise 7
Draw up two accounts of how the problems of online hate came to receive attention:
one, focusing on individuals and on ﬂaws in human nature; the other, focusing on the
actions and responsibilities of the corporations that are involved. You may wish to
do this in outline only, or conduct some further research.
The role of governments A larger political question is the role of governments in
addressing online harms (especially for harms that are not illegal; where they amount
to illegality, the role for government may be clearer). This is a complex political and
legal issue to which ethical questions are relevant, but which goes beyond the scope
of this book; this indeed illustrates again the reach and vast scope of the issues
involved.
9.4.2
What Is Online ‘Harm’?
It should be apparent that there are great complexities and many differences of
opinion concerning the nature of any harm in hate speech. For example, the political
philosopher Jeremy Waldron’s book The Harm in Hate Speech argues that hate
speech causes harm, for example, by undermining the dignity of groups
[21]. Although Waldron’s work has received support, such work is also subject to
serious critique, for example, by Robert Simpson, who gives considerable grounds
for rejecting such claims [22]. It is generally extremely difﬁcult to draw causal links
between online content and real-world harms, which of course does not mean such
causal pathways do not exist. A report on online harms from the Alan Turing
Institute states what it calls the ‘harm paradox’, which is that most online content
is assessed based on what it expresses, rather than on any harm it has caused, and
hence, it’s not known if content labelled harmful, has actually produced any harm
[14, p. 61]. See also the discussion of J. L. Austen’s distinction between illocution-
ary, illocutionary, and perlocutionary acts in Sect. 7.4.
In particular, psychological harms are often subjective, vague, and difﬁcult to
attribute precisely. An abusive and derogatory comment can result in negative
emotions in the person to whom the comment is directed, but there will be a wealth
of complexities concerning the extent of any negative reaction, variations and
disputes about the precise interpretation of language used, the intent of the speaker,
whether the content was directly aimed at the person who feels distress as a result,
and so on. Consider, for example, that attributions of ‘emotional harm’ will be under

dispute by those who consider that any subjectively unpleasant emotion is ipso facto
harm and by those who consider that although some negative emotions may reach a
level of ‘harm’, negative emotions per se are simply part of life and indeed an
essential aspect of achieving maturity. Even so, there is no clear line from emotional
harm to the conclusion that content moderation is the answer. For many cases,
muting the account in question, reading a book, or going to choir practice instead
of doomscrolling Instagram is another possibility.
9.4
Content Moderation for Online Harms: What Is Needed?
379
Exercise 8
There are many aspects to the question of how we understand the possible psycho-
logical harms of online content. Among the complexities is how we understand the
goals of ethics. Different normative ethical theories may tend towards different
responses.
Consider how a utilitarian might address the question of psychological or emo-
tional harms from online content and compare and contrast this with how a virtue
ethicist might approach the question. (See Chap. 6.)
Many of you will have spotted a complexity to this question: Mill himself was a
utilitarian, yet his ideas in On Liberty stress the value of the individual. Consider the
general issues that arise for utilitarianism and accounts of the end goals of ethics of
maximising happiness or pleasure and minimising unhappiness or pain over a whole
population. Consider the notion of phronesis and the development of character.
However, hard as these questions are, it is necessary to consider these matters if
steps are to be taken to address online hate. At a minimum, one would need a
reasonable understanding of how online hate caused harm and a way of detecting
any harmful content such that human moderators and algorithms could detect this
with a reasonable level of accuracy. There is no particular deﬁnition of hate speech in
international human rights law [23]. Yet for content moderation online, we will need
a sufﬁciently precise deﬁnition of online hate and of degrees and kinds of hate.
Is misinformation ‘harm’? Proposals to tackle online harms include proposals to
tackle
‘harmful
misinformation
or
disinformation’
[1].
Concern
about
misinformation online has been acute in recent years, especially in relation to
COVID-19 and to allegations of the spread of misinformation around various
political campaigns. The intentional spread of misinformation for gain, including
for malicious reasons, is certainly not new, but the reach of the Internet and
increasing reliance on it as a source of news and other information, together with
concern about ‘fake news’ and deepfakes, means that it appears to be a greatly
increased issue. The capacity of online material, including images and video, to
capture attention, including the question of possible bias in the recommender
algorithms shaping the online material each person will see, is also an important
factor.
How large is the misinformation problem? Determining the extent of the issue
will be a complex matter. As with online hate, it is challenging to distinguish a rise in
incidents from a rise in reporting. As an example, a highly cited report from the
Oxford Internet Institute on the increasing role of misinformation has been argued to

be methodologically ﬂawed because it overlooks the difﬁculties in distinguishing an
increase in misinformation from an increase in the reporting of concerns about
misinformation [24, 25]. Moreover, just because a person is exposed to
misinformation does not mean that it will be believed. In addition, not all
misinformation is plausibly harmful, especially if we are looking to some threshold
that justiﬁes corporate or government interference over individual behaviour online.
If I read online that Pluto has now been reclassiﬁed back as a planet, have I been
harmed? Okay, my team may lose a point in the next pub quiz, but does this justify
the attention of regulators?
380
9
Individuals, Society, and AI: Online Communication
Note that in addressing such questions, it will be helpful to consider the value that
we place on information and knowledge: is knowledge an instrumental good, valued
for merely pragmatic reasons, or valuable in and of itself? See Sect. 5.2 and consider
the values that may be behind some attitudes towards the development of artiﬁcial
intelligence. How much are concerns about misinformation concerns about the value
of knowledge per se, and how much are they about the use to which information may
be put?
How might we deﬁne online misinformation? We need an account of it which is
helpful in identifying misinformation online which meets a threshold such that
taking steps against it is justiﬁed. Consider, for example, a report by the Alan Turing
Institute, ‘Understanding vulnerability to online misinformation’, which focuses on
concerns around misinformation in the light of the COVID-19 pandemic [26]. The
concern for misinformation regarding COVID-19 in this report is focused upon the
possible harms this might bring, such as hesitancy to vaccinate and loss of trust.
Hence, note that concerns for harms regarding online misinformation may be
speciﬁc to certain contexts. The report draws on a deﬁnition of misinformation as
‘contrary to the epistemic consensus of the scientiﬁc community regarding a phe-
nomenon’ [26, p. 8].
Note two things from this deﬁnition. First, it implies change over time. The
epistemic consensus of a scientiﬁc community will evolve with new evidence and
changing theories. Second, it implies consensus within a community. However,
there are many instances in science in which there is no ﬁrm consensus and in
which it is recognised that there are legitimate differences of opinion given the
current state of evidence and theories. More worrying would be cases where there
was only a minority who differed from a majority view: is the minority view thus
counter to the ‘consensus’? Note the use of the word ‘community’. Does this exclude
amateurs? Does it exclude scientists who lost their position because of the immense
competition for academic and research posts? Does it exclude scientists who lost
their position because of their contrarian views? Do the views of certain scientists,
universities, and research groups dominate particular scientiﬁc communities? If so,
we may in some instances be reproducing power dynamics in using content moder-
ation to ﬂag or remove certain ideas. The attempts to be ‘ethical’ may in fact magnify
existing problems.

9.5
Challenges for AI in Tackling Online Harms
381
The seriousness of the COVID-19 pandemic may lead one to conclude it was
necessary to take such steps, and it is an emotive topic so a more neutral example
might be more effective in generating discussion. It is important to realise the
potential naivety of placing trust in ‘the truth’ as an absolute. Science is a continually
developing area of endeavour. Not only are scientiﬁc ﬁndings continuously being
updated and revised, recent work analysing and critiquing the scientiﬁc publication
system has determined that much of what we think we know is false. ‘p-hacking’ is a
term of art for selectively publishing only those papers that reach certain, often rather
low, thresholds of statistical signiﬁcance [27]. This means that a signiﬁcant
proportion—possibly most—of all scientiﬁc papers are misleading [28]. The impli-
cations for any fact checking efforts are obvious. In relation to the use of algorithms
in the quest to root out online ‘hate’ or purported misinformation, an MIT professor,
Sandy Pentland, is reported as claiming that 75% of all published papers in machine
learning are ‘junk’ [29, p. 146]. Machine learning is a relatively new ﬁeld, so such
claims are almost certain to be disputed, but the very possibility of such serious
dispute is of concern.
Exercise 9
Try to build a deﬁnition of online misinformation that is sufﬁciently robust to use as
a fair basis for moderating online harms. This may work well as a group exercise.
Consider the advantages and dangers of its application.
The need for interdisciplinarity At the very least, this shows the need for work in
ethics, law, and policy to take note of issues in epistemology, philosophy of science,
the politics and sociology of science, and scientiﬁc methodology. Note too how
general assumptions about epistemology, which may be linked perhaps to attitudes
towards the goals and values of AI, may be present: a degree of certainty that we
have reached a state of knowledge, and with this, perhaps a totalising attitude
towards knowledge, which may be another aspect of the control problem with AI
but reinforced via attempts to ensure ethical AI.

Challenges for AI in Tackling Online Harms
Summary
Here, we look more closely at practical and theoretical challenges for the detection of
online harms and hate speech using algorithms. These include problems of context in
the online world and ways in which meaning may be communicated in subtle and
contested ways. H. P. Grice’s account of the maxims governing the interpretation of
conversation is used to discuss difﬁculties of interpreting language online. Speciﬁc
problems in the use of algorithms include problems with state-of-the-art models,
bias, and data quality issues.

Introduction: Detecting Online Harms
We have a general problem: deﬁning hate speech, its varieties, and degrees. The
online world adds another dimension of difﬁculty. These are problems indepen-
dently of any attempt to use AI to detect and monitor it. The algorithms used to
detect online harms and online hate will have to be trained by human moderators.
Hence, we need to consider difﬁculties that humans have with labelling online
content, plus any additional issues speciﬁc to the use of algorithms. This should
include considering what is possible, as well as the current state of play. Unfortu-
nately, there are major hurdles to overcome.
Researchers working in the ﬁeld have noted the many difﬁculties in understand-
ing the nature and extent of online hate [14]. A policy brieﬁng produced by the Alan
Turing Institute in 2019 notes that we do not currently have the tools accurately to
monitor online content and that the ﬁeld suffers from a large range of challenges,
including the deﬁnition of terms, methodology, legal issues, and other theoretical
challenges [30]. A strategic question then arises: if the ethical issues are seen to be
serious and growing, there may be an urgency in addressing them. At the same time,
careful examination of the ﬁeld shows that much is left unknown about the state of
‘online hate’ [31]. There may be different impressions of the scale of the problem
depending on how the matter is presented. The rates of abusive content online may
be estimated to be low, and estimates of prevalence vary wildly, yet a sizeable
minority of the population may be exposed to it [30]. Methodological questions are
many, including how precisely ‘abuse’ or ‘hate’ has been interpreted in research by
the researchers and the respondents. One challenge is to distinguish a rise in abuse
from a rise in reports of abuse. Moreover, an examination of research papers in this
area will show a variety of different terms used and a variety of different phenomena
included.
The good news for those interested in AI ethics is that there is plenty of scope for
further work in this area that seeks to ask clear questions and adopts rigorous
methodology in attempting to gain answers. Let us consider some of the problems.
Many of these concern the nature of natural language itself, especially any contex-
tual and cultural factors. Context is a key part of the interpretation of natural
language (see Sect. 7.5). Meaning is often attributed based upon the context and
assumptions of intent. Earlier I wrote the sentence, ‘The content moderators are not
content.’ The two meanings of ‘content’ can readily be inferred by speakers of
English, given also a basic understanding of the surrounding discussion. A task for
natural language processing needed to detect online hate is to understand this context
adequately.

9.5.2
Language and Meaning
First, we will review the general difﬁculties of attributing meaning to language.
Considerable advances in natural language processing have been made, as we saw
with regard to the LaMDA issue. Note that even if natural language processing could
tackle all these issues as well as a human could, there are going to be points of
contention that remain. Moreover, since an essential aspect of the concern about
online content is how material will be understood by other humans, we cannot
escape having to face the difﬁculties posed in communication via language. We
also need to address the speciﬁc context of the online world and the challenges in the
use of algorithms to moderate content.
Context, culture, and individuals In ﬁnding content harmful, hateful or otherwise
objectionable, there will be large variations of response between individuals, sub-
groups within a society, cultures, and language groups. There are likely to be
differences in demographics, especially as language evolves and is evolving pre-
cisely in response to technology. Many old-fashioned terms of abuse may come to
seem mild or comical or may simply be misunderstood. There is wide variation
between and within languages and cultures over what terms are seen to be abusive
and how abusive they are, with often wide regional and class variations even within
the same culture. This is likely to vary with context even within small groups, with
some language considered suited for some contexts yet not for others. (Recall
Goffman’s distinction between front and back stage, Sect. 3.6.2) The distinction
between the public and the private operates here: language suited for, say, the
workplace or a formal gathering may be judged differently from more private
occasions. The modiﬁcation or erosion of the lines between public and private online
is an important factor.
The many uses of language Another set of difﬁculties arises from the very
complexities of human language use. Sarcasm, irony, satire, and humour are all
essentially human traits, and each demonstrates the ﬂexibility and creativity possible
with language use, but they are also culturally, linguistically, and individually
speciﬁc, and although they may operate extremely well to communicate a great
deal with a few words, they may not translate very well from one group to another
[32]. On the other hand, the view has been expressed that even if a message was
clearly intended as humorous, if it is perceived as hate or as harmful, its status as
humour should make no difference [33].
Language, meaning, and intention The assessment of content as harmful in some
way can be loose and contentious [34]. Some accounts of hate speech include the
responses of others: if a targeted individual or group considers language hateful, or if
a third party does so, then it amounts to hate speech [35]. One disputed issue is the
question of intention: this seems to reverse an account of meaning where the
intention of the speaker sets the meaning: the responses of the hearer now seem to
set the meaning. However, the speaker’s intention can only set the meaning within
limits. Language is shared. I cannot say, ‘The fridge is red’ and mean, ‘Algebra is my

favourite subject in maths’. But I can say, ‘I have an assignment due tomorrow’ and
mean ‘I am not coming to the party.’ Hence, the excuse, ‘I did not mean to imply
so-and-so’ can only be taken so far; how far can speaker’s intention be stretched
within the complexities of the online world?

H. P. Grice and Conversational Implicature
In natural language, there is much that is left to convention and mutual
understanding in how meaning is conveyed. Indeed, the difﬁculties of
presenting a formalised account of meaning within the limits of natural
language is a major source of misunderstanding when attempting to
programme unambiguous instructions into a computer, and is the subject of
many a story about sorcerers’ granting of wishes, as well as the plot of many
stories about mishaps regarding AI including Asimov’s Robot series.
Philosophers and discourse analysts have attempted to analyse how mean-
ing is conveyed over and above the formal meaning of a sentence. H. P. Grice
was the ﬁrst philosopher to theorise about the distinction between speaker
meaning and sentence meaning [36]. Given the loss of context in the online
world, and given deﬁnitions of hate speech which include or focus on the
meanings attributed to content by those reading or hearing it, some such
distinction could be very useful for addressing the issues in online content
moderation. These implicatures of conversation may be used to understand
features of language such as irony and humour.
Grice theorised that there are several implicitly agreed maxims of conver-
sation which govern how speech is interpreted. A general principle of coop-
eration governs what participants accept is the purpose of a conversation.
These are:
The maxim of quality: Claims should be true, so do not state what you
consider to be false or unsupported by evidence.
The maxim of quantity: give an appropriate amount of information as required.
The maxim of relation: be relevant to the purpose of the interchange.
The maxim of manner: avoid being obscure of ambiguous, be brief, and
communicate information in a good order.
Subsequent work has found much of value in Grice’s proposals, although
with modiﬁcations and with much variation including between languages and
cultures in the particular implicatures in operation [37].
Note how Grice’s theory is based upon a principle of cooperation and a level of
mutual understanding, something which is not evenly distributed across the Internet.
Exercise 10
Could some such principle of cooperation be helpful in understanding interchanges
and problems that arise online? Might we need new maxims for online communi-
cation, and if so, what might these be?

9.5
Challenges for AI in Tackling Online Harms
385
Try to ﬁnd some examples of language online where there seems to be a lack of
agreement on conversational maxims.
Does Grice’s account of language make the possibility of use of algorithms for
interpreting language nearer, or does it merely indicate the depth of the problem?
9.5.3
Difﬁculties with Hate Speech
The concept of hate speech has been called ‘essentially contested’, meaning that
there are insurmountable differences of opinion about how it should be understood
[14, p. 41, 38]. There are examples of putative online hate that could readily be
contested by others. For example, one academic journal article refers to the hijacking
of hashtags as a form of online hate, using the example of the #Shoutyourabortion
Twitter campaign [39]. However, one might readily point out that both sides in the
abortion debate could consider that the other side was ‘hateful’, given the depth of
feeling and the seriousness of the issues. This is perhaps then a good example to
warn against politicising notions of online hate and ensuring a good range of
diversity in those who are advising, drawing up regulations and policy, and acting
as human moderators.
Degrees of online hate Measuring degrees of online hate seems essential if pro-
portionality is to be applied to any remedies used. A social media post telling
someone that their latest hair cut doesn’t suit them is a far cry from content issuing
extreme levels of hatred for certain groups or individuals. But how are any grada-
tions to be drawn? The question of attributing degree to online hate relates to many
things: the changing nature of language, even where deﬁnitions are agreed upon, and
individual and subjective responses to terms.
Could a system for monitoring online hate and abuse impose the values of a
dominant group onto less powerful groups in how language and communication is
regulated and dealt with? Indeed, it seems likely to do so, unless rigorous steps are
taken against it.
Exercise 11
One aspect of the control problem in AI is the possibility of conformity to a totalising
system, especially given the potential reach of much AI. Is it possible that monitor-
ing online hate through a nationally imposed system might have such an impact? If
so, would it matter, and if so, how, and how much?
Dog whistles A contested term which has received considerable attention is the
concept of the ‘dog whistle’, as an attempt to hide hateful messages by implying
something which is never actually stated, and supposedly then send an implicit
message intended for certain groups only who will be primed to decipher it in certain
ways. Dog whistles are sometimes seen to be ways of communicating hateful
messages more broadly with impunity, because the hate is implied not stated
[40]. Because the meaning is carried implicitly and may be unreadable to many,

this may imply that dog whistles are less serious forms of online abuse (although
note that a dog whistle could also be used to carry a harmless in-group reference).
However, a dog whistle could also be used to convey rather extreme messages and
may be thought to be particularly problematic in demonstrating devious attempts to
circumnavigate censorship. The very nature of dog whistles means that their detec-
tion will be contestable, whether on- or ofﬂine [41, 42]. They can thus readily be
mistakenly or mischievously attributed to innocent parties.
386
9
Individuals, Society, and AI: Online Communication
A related term is that of microaggressions [43]. A suggested example of a
microaggression in the online space is only responding to comments from people
who are of the same group [14, p. 53]. While some consider that the recognition of
microaggressions is necessary, the concept is also disputed, and even if the concept
itself is seen as generally valid, there are disagreements about the concept’s appli-
cation. On the one hand, the difﬁculties of reaching agreement on examples
of microaggressions and dog whistles seem only to add to the general difﬁculties
of deﬁning and detecting hate speech. On the other hand, if the whole point of
moderating online content is to detect such subtleties of language use, their inclusion
in any account of online hate may be seen as necessary [44].
Exercise 12
Consider the advantages and disadvantages of including dog whistles and/or
microaggressions in accounts of online hate. How could meaning be attributed in
such cases? Are there dangers of false attribution? What accounts of language and
meaning does the concept of a dog whistle rest upon? Do you think it is possible or
likely that an algorithm may be able to detect these?
The use of the terms ‘dog whistle’ and ‘microaggression’ is relatively new. The
terms may be considered useful advances, with origins in both the wish to progress
the study of communication and to improve our understanding of patterns of
discrimination and exclusion.
Exercise 13
Consider the pros and cons of incorporating such relatively new concepts for
describing language and communication into a methodology for detecting online
hate. Consider: ‘This shows progress in understanding the impact we have on each
other and raised levels of responsibility in speech; perhaps, indeed, our raised
awareness of communication online has helped us to this understanding’, versus,
‘We are looking for offense where none is to be found. This takes attention away
from more serious concerns,’ and in addition, ‘These complexities demonstrate the
inability of either human or AI to address online harms adequately’.
9.5.4
Problems with Algorithms
There are multiple challenges in the use of algorithms to detect online content,
including hate speech or online harms. Many of these problems can be addressed and

improved with better research and more data; others may be more intractable. As we
have seen, algorithms built to detect online hate have to cope with understanding
context, speaker, audience, and the constantly shifting nature of hate speech. This
includes features such as spelling changes (including deliberate attempts to get past
moderation systems), dialects, subcultures, stereotypes, sarcasm, irony, humour,
metaphor, and other features of language and communication that defy precise
formalisation. The algorithms will need to be continuously updated.
9.5
Challenges for AI in Tackling Online Harms
387
There are many difﬁculties in attempting content moderation for online hate.
Work from the Hate Speech: Measures and Counter Measures project at the Alan
Turing Institute states that ‘critical challenges are unsolved’, including lack of
dataset sharing and classiﬁcation bias [31].
Many others agree. Research demonstrates that ideas of language acceptability
are malleable and vary according to social context and that there may be differences
in ratings of online content by different annotators; automated content moderation
systems risk increasing these differences [45]. Researchers have found signiﬁcant
differences between ratings of online content by males and females. Other work also
ﬁnds difﬁculties in rating social media comments for ‘hate’ [46].
A recent review ﬁnds that existing ‘state of the art’ models have been ‘severely
overestimated’ [47]. In other words, the models are inaccurate. Problems are found
to stem from nonstandard grammar and vocabulary, paucity and bias in datasets, and
implicit expressions of hate. The potential for increasing the harm against minority
groups in attempts to detect online hate was conﬁrmed. There is a high level of
disagreement between those who label content.
Machine learning relies upon datasets that are labelled by human moderators.
However, moderators are often untrained, even for those sets of data upon which
research work in online hate is conducted [33, at 44.12]. Even where they are trained,
such training is found to vary greatly. However, it is on the judgements of human
moderators that the norms of any automated content moderation system will be built.
It is well established that algorithms may magnify existing biases, that this
particularly may affect minority groups, and that correcting this is very challenging.
It is now well known that the use of algorithms carries with it the risk of bias from the
data on which it is developed and/or the model used in the algorithm [48–50]. The
widespread use of algorithms may greatly magnify any existing bias, which may
then become further entrenched. Algorithmic bias tends to magnify existing unfair-
ness by most impacting those groups who are already subject to bias [51]. It has been
amply demonstrated that labelling content as ‘hate’ carries the risk of racial bias and
bias against different dialects [52–54]. Attempts to address such bias have them-
selves been found to contain numerous shortcomings [55].
In an attempt to improve matters, researchers have developed ‘HATECHECK’, a
system of tests to determine which different aspects of hate speech detection models
are ﬂawed, covering 29 different aspects [56]. This research ﬁnds deep problems and
critical model weaknesses. All models tested were overly sensitive to some key-
words and phrases, such as reclaimed slurs, counter speech, and negated hate,
consistently misclassify certain content, and misclassify content in ways biased
towards certain groups.

Individuals, Society, and AI: Online Communication
Exercise 14
What challenges are there for providing a deﬁnition of online hate such that an
algorithm could be able reliably to detect it?
Of the difﬁculties with detecting meaning in natural language online discussed
here, consider which are most readily overcome. Could the use of AI make us feel
the issue is solvable, with time, and might this be an illusion?
Exercise 15
Compare and contrast the beneﬁts and problems with using human moderators
versus algorithms.
Could AI be more consistent and therefore fairer?
Could AI be gradually improved?
Could AI overcome the bias and inconsistencies of humans?
Technological optimism and technological solutionism We have looked at how
AI may inspire great optimism and also dread and fear. We have looked at how
tropes of technological progress may be linked to assumptions of moral progress. Is
it possible that here we have a toxic mix of competing elements? Fear of the forces in
human nature unleashed by the affordances of technology and the abilities it gives us
to subvert norms of human communication seems perhaps combined with an
optimistic assumption that the very technology (and those who created it) can
address the problem and that the well-understood problems can be overcome, if
only we try harder.
Exercise 16
Argue for or against each of these positions and consider how some accommodation
may be reached:
Claim: content moderation using algorithms plus human review will produce a
workable system to detect and deal with online hate. It may not be perfect, but
it can be ‘good enough’. Nothing in this world is perfect, and there are serious
harms being perpetrated that must be addressed.
Counterclaim: The root source of most of the ﬂaws in content moderation using
algorithms is the disputed notions of ‘online harms’ and ‘online hate’. Human
review may help in some cases but will not solve this and may even make things
worse.
This may work well as a group exercise or class debate.
There may well be downsides to incautious assumptions that technology can
solve this problem, especially if the end goal is not well articulated, which is an
instance of the general problem that goals may be instantiated in ways that have
unforeseen and undesirable effects. For example, some research indicates that
allowing a diversity of views online may be necessary to facilitate agreement in
online groups [57]. This may be a manifestation of one of J. S. Mill’s arguments for
free speech that the continued presence of opposing views enables individuals to
understand and robustly support their own views. Research also warns of the limits
to our capacities to process information: just because there is more of it out there

does not necessarily mean to say that we all understand more [58]. It may not be a
cornucopia in which we pick knowledge from every tree, but a jungle in which we
get easily lost.

Bias and the Production of ‘AI Ethics’

Bias and the Production of ‘AI Ethics’
Summary
Here, we examine how bias may be present in attempts to address the ethical issues
concerning online content. Biases may be present in how the problem is set up, in
algorithms, in human moderators, and in feedback loops generated by methods
adopted to address particular accounts of the issues. We need to be aware of possible
bias in those tackling ethics, policy, and regulation. Interest in developing technol-
ogies may be at odds with best ethical practice.
We have examined the question of bias in algorithms, which is nested within the
issue of bias (and general inaccuracies and inconsistencies) in human moderators
who train algorithms. However, the question of bias towards this issue, and many
other issues in AI ethics, may also be biased in various other ways. Indeed, if we
focus on bias as a merely technical issue in algorithms that can be ‘solved’, then this
may distract us from the ways in which bias may operate elsewhere.
We have already seen how algorithms may be biased and how in particular bias
may be especially hard to tackle when interpreting natural language. This may lead
in particular to bias against certain ethnic and cultural groups; moreover, these will
tend to be groups already suffering from discrimination, and the use of algorithms to
address an ethical issue may act to further entrench the linguistic and cultural
dominance of those who already have power, and act as a move towards conformity.
This may be reinforced by the labelling of content as misinformation, unless great
care is taken. How are decisions about moderation made by humans impacted by the
decisions made by algorithms and the values of the tech ﬁrms for which they work?
Bias may creep into any ethical issue from the beginning, depending upon how
the problem is stated and illustrated. We could formulate this as the problem of
‘online hate’ or ‘online harms’; we could also formulate this as the problem of
‘online censorship’, of being cancelled or blocked, and denied access to the online
space. Indeed, both issues may have affected the very same individuals and groups.
There may be bias operating both when claims of online harms are endorsed and
when they are rejected.
Once a problem has been identiﬁed in a certain way, the very steps taken to
address it may further entrench the initial viewpoint. Let us take a simpliﬁed
example: suppose there is widespread concern that dog lovers are unduly aggressive
towards cat lovers online. Steps are taken to address this. Cat lovers are encouraged
to report dog lovers for hate. Several dog lovers have content removed and accounts
blocked. This receives considerable coverage. Cat lovers get sympathy in the media;
dog lovers are held under suspicion. Free speech groups are accused of being dog

sympathisers or ‘dog adjacent’. ‘Dog adjacent’ accounts and advocates of free
speech come under scrutiny by cat lovers, and as a result, several of these are
found to be guilty of online hate. Research and policy work to address the issue
consults stakeholders from those who feel they have been affected by online
aggression, which overwhelmingly includes cat lovers.
390

Individuals, Society, and AI: Online Communication
And that is how come cats rule the Internet.
Indeed, it may be useful to consider whether some academic and policy literature
may contain seeds of political bias. Research has found that academics, on average,
are more left wing than the general public, although the extent of any bias is disputed
[59, 60]. Some work on online content moderation is concerned with the activities of
the far right, but less has addressed the far left [61]. A report by the Alan Turing
Institute presents the ‘free speech defence’ of online content as a form of animosity
and a possible subtype of online harm [24, p. 53]. While this could be true in some
cases, especially given the difﬁculty of producing an agreed upon and rigorous
account of online harm, the possibility of bias must not be overlooked. Again, the
need for wide discussion, the input of a large range of opinion, and those from
diverse backgrounds, is underlined, including in any stakeholders and groups
consulted in developing policy.
The organisational structures within which ethics and policy advice in AI is
developed may also be relevant to questions of bias. As a relatively new area of
concern, there are not yet many people working in the area, and those with relevant
expertise may have close links with each other. The dangers of groupthink may be
present. Working closely with experts in technology who are developing algorithms,
including for content moderation, is of course useful in ensuring detailed technical
knowledge but may bias policy makers and those working in ethics to assume that a
technical solution is best and will work. Funding may depend upon governments.
Moreover, links with government and policy makers may further entrench the
possible biases of those producing policy and ethics responses. Are some of those
who are currently producing ethics and policy advice part and parcel of government
or corporate power? There is an urgent need for independent civil society groups and
others to engage in such debates and to be taken seriously as participants; some such
groups already exist. This may be particularly important in this area, given the
contentious nature of deﬁning online hate and the seriousness of issues for individ-
uals and for society as a whole. There are proposals that expert advice should be fed
into the work of regulators [15]. But who are these experts going to be?
We also need to consider the interests of governments in pursuing particular
policies. Leadership in ethics is sought as much as in technology; this may of course
include political posturing and the wish to rush in ﬁrst so that others are forced to
follow, as well as elements of national pride. A government minister has stated,
referring to the government’s response to the Online Harms White Paper consulta-
tion: ‘I am conﬁdent that today’s measures mark a signiﬁcant step in the continual
evolution of our approach to our life online—and it’s ﬁtting that this should be a step
that our country takes. The World Wide Web was of course invented by a Brit. And
now the UK is setting a safety standard for the rest of the world to follow’ [62]. Note
too that in his address, the same minister mentioned the speciﬁc concerns that

members of Parliament have had regarding alleged online abuse [62]. No mention
was made of concerns regarding undue content removal. Might this skew the debate?
An express aim of the UK government has been ‘to make Britain the safest place in
the world to go online’ [2, 15, p. 4]. Might this suggest a priority towards concern
with online harms, rather concern for online censorship or the problems faced by
those unjustly treated by content moderation?
9.7
AI, Online Content, Persons, Self, and Society
391
Furthermore, note how ambitions for technological progress may in such
instances be linked to ambitions in setting the agenda and providing ethical leader-
ship. In part, this is due to the widely perceived necessity of considering ethical
issues in AI. Note that governments are susceptible to lobbying, and this includes
from those who stand to gain ﬁnancially and otherwise from developing safety
technology used among other things for content moderation [63].
An additional and major concern that adds great complexity is the role and
responsibilities of the companies who develop, market, and proﬁt from the technol-
ogies that are creating the issues and who are also moderating content. Proposals
from the UK government to give ‘duties of care’ to social media companies with
regard to online harms may from one point of view look rather like asking the fox to
look after the henhouse. The very people who have created the problem are charged
with addressing it.
Finally, we must also consider the broader and more general question of how the
ways in which we see technology, its capabilities, and its ﬂaws may impact how we
see the world and each other. Might the very idea of eradicating bias online, of
eradicating online harms, and the idea that technology can do this for us have an
inﬂuence on how we understand the world and ourselves? Might the idea that we can
use technology to create ‘the safest place in the world to go online’ have an inﬂuence
on how we see safety and risk? We consider these ideas further in Sect. 9.8.
9.7
AI, Online Content, Persons, Self, and Society
Summary
We examine the ethical implications of how the online world may inﬂuence how
people see themselves and relate to others. These include anonymity, deepfakes, and
the magniﬁcation of reactions, for instance, in the Internet pile-on. We also consider
how users may be manipulated by aspects of technological design, which may be
both at cross-purposes with the purposes of users and may intentionally exploit some
of our worst traits. The implications for agency and responsibility are discussed.
The complexity of how people communicate online is again an area of central ethical
importance where there is an essential need for both theoretical and empirical
research across different disciplines. Background models of human nature and of
the person will help to understand the issues. We have seen the importance of how
people relate to each other, the importance, especially highlighted in some
approaches to ethics, of attention to and respect for others (see Sect. 8.3). However,

we have also noted how readily dehumanisation may occur. Recall how research
mentioned in discussing the concept of a person and people living with dementia
noted the importance of bodily expression and appearance in maintaining a sense of
self and being seen by others (see Sect. 8.5). Indeed, much work in social psychol-
ogy has noted how readily dehumanisation can occur and how group pressures can
distort thinking and behaviour [64]. The ways in which we see ourselves through
technology, the feedback we get from others via technology, and the way we see
others, how we connect to different communities and a sense of public and private,
may very well be changing our behaviour—for better, one would hope, but likely as
well, for worse. Virtue ethics stresses the importance and the difﬁculty of moral
education and the development of character, with the surrounding social environ-
ment being an essential element. But what kind of communities wait for us online?
As with so much else related to AI and new technologies, there is great promise but
also peril. There is considerable work underway examining such questions with
media and communications scholars specialising in digital communications; the
ethical discussions here are just one aspect of this complex political, societal,
cultural, and technological debate [3, 65, 66].

Individuals, Society, and AI: Online Communication
Some features of the online world enable considerable magniﬁcation of behav-
iours that are also possible in the ofﬂine world. For example, the phenomenon of the
Internet pile-on is enabled by the sheer number of people who can see content, the
capacity to share content with great rapidity, and the considerable number of
anonymous accounts online. Doxxing, publishing identifying information about a
person online with malicious intent, takes advantage of the power of Internet search
engines and facilities such as image searches, both to uncover information about an
individual and then to gain great traction in spreading it [67].
Exercise 17
In an Internet pile-on, hundreds or thousands of individuals may target an individual
with messages seen as abusive, hurtful, or harmful. Individually, each one of these
may be relatively innocuous, or just slightly hurtful. Collectively, they could be far
more of a problem. (Imagine going into work 1 day, and a colleague remarks, ‘I
thought your presentation yesterday was a little boring’. Now imagine that you work
in a company with 10,000 employees and every one of them calls, texts, pops into
your ofﬁce, or emails, to tell you that your presentation was a little boring.)
What responsibilities might each person have individually for participating in an
Internet pile-on? Consider different cases, including any examples you know of.
Online anonymity is a good example of how relations with others online may be
deeply distorted compared to the general possibilities of ordinary life. On the one
hand, it may enable certain protections, for example, for dissidents in certain
countries posting material critical of their governments [68] or for employees who
have reasonable fears that their employer may take action against them for reason-
able beliefs. (Indeed, a complexity: the very attempt to target material online, which
is ‘legal but harmful to adults’, may only increase such concerns.) On the other hand,
it can enable and perhaps encourage illegal activity, abuse, harassment, and other
behaviours that one might never have indulged in without the invisibility cloak of

anonymity. (Recall the Ring of Gyges, Sect. 1.6) An individual may display a
considerable part of his or her personality and beliefs through the protection of the
anonymity of the Internet. One’s online presence can also mean more than
presenting a persona to others and communicating: the consequences of being
‘cancelled’ online may be severe.

Exercise 18
Some have suggested that ending online anonymity may be one way of addressing
online abuse. Using as many concrete examples as you can, discuss the arguments
for and against. Consider especially questions about how we relate to each other as
persons.
Our responsibility and agency online may also be impacted by the affordances of
the technologies. For example, it is simple to block or mute people. This may be a
perfectly legitimate response, and we are perfectly well permitted to exercise choice
in who we interact with in our private lives. Except for family. Oh, and neighbours.
Oh, and your best friend’s wife whom you ﬁnd slightly annoying, and so on. This
points, of course, to the very different attitudes and norms about community and
connection that exist. Consider again the notion of phronesis, the demands of social
life and of morality, and how the online world may differ from the ofﬂine world.
Exercise 19
Might we rely upon the affordances of technology to take control of issues that we
would otherwise have to handle in different ways? Try to think of some different
aspects of technology and to consider both positive, negative, and neutral conse-
quences. Don’t forget to think of what the technologies may have replaced or
eclipsed.
How users are seen by those designing the technology So far, we have examined
some features of online communication and how they might impact our sense of self
and how we relate to others. We have thought of these simply as features of
technology as if they have just popped up from nowhere. Such features are all
designed, even though certain aspects and consequences of how they work may
not have been explicitly intended. In large part, they are designed to ﬁt the purposes
of the companies producing the technology, and these may very well not be in
harmony with the purposes of the users. Even the ‘ethical’ features may serve the
purposes of maintaining company image, even if they are also beneﬁcial.
Moreover, design features may not simply be at cross purposes with the purposes
of users: they may be placed there in order to manipulate users. This includes the
gathering and analysis of large amounts of data, which are then used, for example, in
recommender algorithms and in advertising. They also include the wide range of
‘persuasive technology’ designed to trap our attention, a particularly troubling issue
given the importance of attention to understanding ethical questions and respecting
others [19, 69, 70]. Moreover, much of the technology engages in the worst aspects
of human psychology: angry responses are more likely to lead to sustained engage-
ment online [8].

394

Individuals, Society, and AI: Online Communication
It seems then as if online users are being regarded as a behaviourist might regard
an experimental subject, a box from which to elicit a response given certain stimuli
(see Sect. 8.4). Moreover, the power to do this is enhanced because the human
subjects are not merely seen as black boxes, but the weaknesses of our psychology
are used against us.
This view of online users extends to some of the work trying to tackle online
abuse, which talks of an ‘alt right pipeline’ that purportedly exists online. Concerns
are raised about online radicalisation and how exposure to certain material that may
be within the boundaries of the acceptable can lead to exposure to increasing
problematic—in this case, right wing and far right—material [71]. There are also
concerns expressed by policy researchers about a ‘global ecosystem of hate’ enabled
by communication online [72, p. 8].
Does the notion of a ‘pathway’ imply that the seeds of violence may already be
present? Because such putative pathways are very hard to trace with rigour, are we
are paving the way for a notion of ‘precrime’? Perfectly legal content, much of it
harmless under any stretch of the imagination, may have actions taken against it if it
is ‘potentially’ part of a pathway to extremism. Much will depend of course upon the
surrounding social, political, and legal circumstances, but action regarding the online
world may well spill over into other areas of life. Moreover, claims for such causal
links between certain online content and the rise of extremism are very complex, and
drawing clear lines of causation is problematic [71].
Exercise 20
Consider different ways in which agency and responsibility are understood in
addressing issues of alleged online harms. You may ﬁnd it useful to review previous
material on persons and on human nature.
Do you agree to any degree with the following statements? What are the reasons
for your answer?
‘The technology is designed to incite users to irrational, emotional behaviour.
Then, it judges us by a ‘rational’ standard of behaviour that it has incited users to
violate. Moreover, those who are incited to take offence are treated differently from
those who are incited to give offence.’
‘Pernicious actors are using the internet to propagate harmful views and to recruit
and seduce others to agree to these. Even if those seduced by harmful ideologies may
be innocent at ﬁrst, by travelling down this route they cross the line to become
perpetrators themselves.’
Deﬁnitions
of
online
hate
or
online
harms,
agency,
intention,
and responsibility On some accounts of hate speech and of online harms, the
response to the content of the intended recipient of the message and of third parties
can be critical for labelling it as harmful [31]. Language is a social phenomenon: we
often use language with the intention of producing particular responses in those
reading or hearing, including both behaviour and psychological responses (see the
discussion of J. L. Austen in Sect. 7.4). However, some concepts of online harms
may shift the attention to the responses of any audience (whether the intended
audience or not) and away from any intention of the speaker (or writer). How

might this shift perceptions of agency and responsibility, and how may it impact how
we communicate online? Although we may intend certain things by speaking, and
not intend others, there are certain limits to what we can and cannot reasonably
intend. The online world, however, greatly increases the audience of any content and
tends to strip away the context of how intention and meaning are understood. We
noted in Sect. 7.4 that early work by philosophers of language in pragmatics has
advanced considerably in the ﬁelds of both philosophy of language and discourse
analysis. The area of online communication is an obvious site where different norms
of linguistic engagement may apply.
9.7
AI, Online Content, Persons, Self, and Society
395
Exercise 21
It has been suggested that humour is no defence against allegations of online harms.
Consider arguments for and against, including consideration of how meaning is
understood, context, agency, and responsibility. Does the online world give us all
different responsibilities in communicating?
Exercise 22
‘The right to free speech does not include the right to access any particular online
space. Therefore, if a person is ousted from an online platform, or even from all of
them, this does not violate any of their rights.’
Discuss.
Deepfakes and online harms Many of the concerns about online harms stem from
the new or increased possibilities that technology presents us with, coupled with the
importance to individuals (and groups) of their reputation, and the hurt that targeted
insults or abuse may produce. A paradox of the online world is that it has both helped
to spread information and knowledge to extremely large audiences and at the same
time made it harder to discern what is true and what is false. Technical attempts to
spot deepfakes are of course one part of a solution but may consist of a cat-and-
mouse game against those producing deepfakes.
Exercise 23
Suppose somebody has been the victim of intentional malice, and a deepfake photo
or video of the person naked and in a compromising position has been circulated
online: in fact it’s the person’s face, but everything else is fake. Great distress and
harm have been caused by this unfortunately common phenomenon. Is this different
in any ethically signiﬁcant way to circulating material online which simply claims in
words that the person has taken part in such compromising circumstances?
Now suppose that the photo or video was only ever circulated clearly labelled,
‘this is fake, it’s not X’s body, we just used X’s face’. Does this change the nature or
degree of wrongdoing in any way? If this was you, or a close friend, how might you
feel about it? You may wish to consider the discussion of notions of reality in Sect.
7.5. Recall our discussion of stigma and spoiled identity in Sect. 7.2.4 and discus-
sions of dignity (see Sect. 2.4.9 and elsewhere), its importance, yet the difﬁculty of
articulating violations of dignity very precisely.

The Use of AI: Reshaping Ethical Questions?
Summary
We discuss how the very use of AI and attempts to address the problems that AI is
seen to create may shift our perceptions of ethical questions and of appropriate
responses to them. This may operate through factors involving software, hardware,
and the underlying attitudes and ideology of AI. The use of algorithms may perhaps
lead us to demand more rigour than is reasonable or desirable. Human discretion
may be eclipsed by requirements of training. The drive to a consistent and uniform
answer to ethical questions may inadvertently lead to cultural domination.
We have considered at various points how progress in technology and progress in
ethics may be seen to be interconnected. We have also asked how the affordances
and values associated with technology might potentially inﬂuence how we see the
world and ourselves. The ways in which technology might inﬂuence ethics may
operate through the hardware, the software, and through the ideologies and expec-
tations we impose upon it.
How a problem is seen and the importance attached to it Are the values of
technology moulding how we evaluate it? Are we assessing ethical questions
through a prism formed by our very use of AI? The dominance of the online
world as a place of communication means that difﬁcult ethical questions may now
be seen within this world, and the particular ways in which they manifest there may
inﬂuence wider thinking. These include, as we have seen, the affordances created by
technology for communication and for its control, as well as ways of attempting to
circumvent such controls. At the same time, as we have seen, the identiﬁcation of
ethical issues associated with the online world is closely tied to developments
ofﬂine, such as in the case of online harms, concern for discrimination against
protected groups, and concern about individual harassment, which has come to be
enshrined in law in many places in recent years or decades. It should be stated, as a
reminder, that probing and questioning such things should not be taken to undermine
the seriousness of the issues; their very seriousness necessitates close inspection.
However, we have seen that the ways in which a problem is described can make a
signiﬁcant difference. Hence, understandings of the relationship between the online
and the ofﬂine world, understandings of the attribution of agency and responsibility,
can make a large difference to questions such as the responsibility of platforms, of
governments, and of individuals, and to the perception of how to strike a balance
between the protection of the individual, of groups, and of society, and, indeed, what
these protections are—the protection of freedom of expression, the capacity to use
the online world, the protection against harm or harassment.
The very fact of government consideration of taking action against online content
which is deemed ‘harmful but not illegal’ may of course arise from the development
of a serious set of problems made possible by technology, but nonetheless, in itself
suggests that the online world and what goes on there, including of course the actions
of
the
technology
companies,
may
be
changing
notions
of
government

responsibilities and of standards of behaviour. Several countries worldwide are
currently considering laws to govern ‘online hate’.
9.8
The Use of AI: Reshaping Ethical Questions?
397
How the problem is addressed We have focused here on the use of algorithms to
combat alleged online harms. Assessing how their use may impact the situation
involves examining them directly as well as how they are compared and contrasted
to human agency. Their use will introduce elements of formalism that may distort
outcomes and thinking. Using algorithms in areas that involve values means that we
will have to ﬁt our values into this formal system. This may distort our values and
priorities by many subtle means [73]. For example, Cathy O’Neill shows how
systems for ranking universities have impacted the real world in signiﬁcant and
deleterious ways, as universities chase higher rankings [48].
Michael Roth and Aaron Kearns work on what they call the ‘new science’ of
trying to formulate precise deﬁnitions for use with algorithms: formalised deﬁnitions
of value concepts may differ in signiﬁcant ways from legal and philosophical
deﬁnitions of those same concepts [29, p. 18]. They are at pains to point out that
there must be trade-offs among different goals. The use of algorithms for certain
tasks may leave out critical aspects of complex concepts and values. We have seen
how we will need a deﬁnition of online harms and online hate which algorithms
could follow, yet how these concepts are essentially contested and hard to deﬁne.
Are we demanding rigour where there is none to be had?
Bear in mind that feedback mechanisms exist that may have different impacts
upon how a system of algorithmic review is perceived. On the one hand, the very use
of such a system will produce results that, for many, will validate the system. To be
vindicated for an allegation of online harm, to be found guilty of such, may reinforce
the apparent validity of the system. However, disputes may highlight the uncer-
tainties of the system and the need for human review and human discretion. (See
Sect. 6.3.3 on understanding and interpreting rules.)
Note too that failure to ﬁnd a sharply deﬁned and rigorously consistent account
of, and remedy for, a problem should not necessarily mean that we can do and say
nothing about it. As Aristotle stated, in any subject, we can only demand the level of
precision that it permits. We need a ‘good enough’ model.
Discretion: Humans versus machines But how much human discretion is possible
in practice? Perhaps not enough; perhaps none. Human content moderators who
have the dismal tasks of reviewing online material for violent and pornographic
content generally have to make extremely swift decisions and are required to have a
high level of conformity to the expected judgements [74]. In his book The New Laws
of Robotics: Defending Human Expertise in the Age of AI, Frank Pasquale discusses
the professional judgement and values that should be retained in the face of auto-
mation [75]. He identiﬁes as a problem with jobs such as content moderator is that
they are not seen as ‘professional’ and workers are under the control of management
hierarchy, trained (or not trained but still controlled by) to certain standards, and with
no space for individual discernment or difference of judgement.

398
9
Individuals, Society, and AI: Online Communication
Exercise 24
Consider the pros and cons of allowing discretion in content moderation decisions,
compared to a rigorously applied formal system with clearly deﬁned rules that admit
of no exception. Illustrate with examples, real or imaginary. Consider the implica-
tions of your answers for systems of human review and of appeal.
Indeed, we have considered shifts in how the meaning may be attributed to
language online. There is a certain formalism to the approach to language that fails
to take into account the reasonably intended context of the original material. Yet
context is admitted for those who ﬁnd material to be of concern. Here is another
suggestion for thinking about the matter: the idea of combatting bias as an ideal, a
formalism applied to humans, has perhaps infected the whole way in which some are
thinking about content online. We are seeing a peculiar shift of epistemic values,
where we want to get rid of all falsehoods, all misinformation, yet at the same time
are only too willing to suppress true information if it hurts feelings. Negative human
emotions need to be curtailed, as if all emotions must be mild; that ‘someone’ has to
‘take charge’ of these things; the online world must be safe; and we can simply
communicate as if we were simply transmitting ‘facts’ about the world.
The counter to this might be that far from leading us to a glorious future where
humanity can bloom, what AI has done for us in the most part online is to heighten
our worst aspects, to turn us into a bunch of atavistic squabbling lunatics, and the
best we can do is to use anything we can to combat this.
Exercise 25
Consider and discuss these two positions and add any nuance of your own.
Content
moderation,
control,
and
responsibility The
different
ways
of
approaching the issues, the very complexities of the question (only a small part of
which we have addressed here), mean that there are many different ways of under-
standing the responsibilities of different parties and the agency each have. We have
seen how individuals producing online content may be seen at once as being without
agency, the subject of inﬂuences, and simultaneously as possessing agency and
hence culpable for their actions, as at once responsible for online content, hence
viewed as an agent, yet simultaneously denied the defence that they did not intend to
harm or offend. Likewise, although we have not had space to discuss this here, those
controlling the technology companies shift and slide over their responsibility and
agency. There may be subtle and sometimes conﬂicting shifts in notions of
responsibility.
The possible harms of online content and the possible remedies also impact
agency and our sense of control. Damage to reputation can spread readily and can
have real-world impacts, such as acting to block an individual from employment, but
steps to address this involve tracking individuals online and a considerable increase
in what amounts to surveillance. Details of some proposed steps illustrate this, such
as banning anonymous accounts, banning end-to-end encryption, and requiring the
same standards across platforms to prevent ‘cheating’ the system by moving to a
different platform in response to banning or content removal [1]. Could this be a

move towards what is effectively a social credit system, especially given the
importance of online communication [76]?
9.8
The Use of AI: Reshaping Ethical Questions?
399
Exercise 26
Humans are social creatures; hence, in any society, there are penalties and rewards
for bad or good behaviour. These penalties and rewards are often subtle; they are
often not applied, and a whole range of considerations operate around them, such as
the notion of forgiveness, apology, and the need to maintain social connections.
Consider what, if anything, might constitute a reasonable system of penalties for
online behaviour that may be deemed as harmful but not illegal. When might this
amount to an illicit system of social credit?
Consider how the values of the individual and the values of the wider social group
are impacted by different answers to this question.
Questions of accountability, transparency, and the need for an explanation
also arise here as elsewhere. Precisely what explanation a user of a social media
platform might be owed may be problematic, since there is no general right to use
any speciﬁc platform (proposals to ensure that users cannot simply migrate from
platform to platform complicate the question). Moreover, one only needs to peruse
various online platforms for a short time to see bafﬂed users struggling to understand
content moderation decisions: both decisions to remove material or block accounts
and seemingly inconsistent decisions to leave other material in place. The nuances
and context of language use add an additional layer of complexity. Moreover, some
of the remedies taken by platforms and proposals for dealing with allegedly harmful
content are such that a user may never know (although they may suspect) that action
has been taken against them and hence will never even seek an explanation. Shadow
banning means a user is partially blocked and content may simply be made harder to
ﬁnd or rendered invisible to other users.
Exercise 27
Does shadow banning serve a useful purpose in retaining a degree of freedom of
expression while protecting other online users, or does it pose problems, for instance,
for any right to an explanation?
Content moderation and global issues in AI The possibilities of formalism and
the imposition of a uniﬁed standard on modes of communication have global
implications. We have already touched upon work that ﬁnds that minority groups
are disproportionately more likely to experience adverse results from content mod-
eration decisions, much of this stemming from cultural and linguistic differences in
language use and expression, including context, which may change rapidly and
differ between different subgroups. The expression of hope we saw from the UK
government of setting standards and leadership in this area may also be cause for
concern.
Consider one possible element of disagreement: A part of the background of how
content moderation online is viewed is formed by local laws and opinion, much of
which has shifted considerably in recent times. Concern extends to protected

categories; but these are deﬁned differently in different geographical and national
areas, new categories may yet be added, and disputes exist about the justiﬁcation and
nature of these protected categories. There are also disagreements concerning the
relative value of freedom of expression in different places. Meanwhile, there may be
hopes for setting international standards for online harms and online hate, but there
are large numbers of very poorly paid workers, including in developing countries,
suffering mentally and ﬁnancially from immersion in a world of extremely graphic
content.

Individuals, Society, and AI: Online Communication
Exercise 28
One of the major concerns of AI ethics is how certain regions that dominate in the
production and deployment of AI may impose their own local standards on others.
Could the search for a universal standard of ethics do the same?
Is this related to the problem of trying to make a global market place of speech
when language and expression should be seen as essentially local in some respects?
9.9
And Just to Finish
We have looked at many aspects of the ethical question of online harms, but it will be
apparent that much remains to consider, such as attention to how precisely to tackle
the issues in different contexts. This reﬂects the complexity of the questions, plus the
need for detailed knowledge of context.
Let us ﬁnish with some last and rather general exercises.
Exercise 29
Try to produce a deﬁnition of online harms.
What challenges are there? What is the nature of the challenges? How readily
might these challenges be overcome?
Consider cultural, regional, and demographic differences in how online harms
might be understood.
Consider any novel means by which the online world might enable or heighten
the capacity to produce hate speech or abuse against individuals or groups.
Consider how the ethics literature, theories, and concepts that we have explored
in this book might contribute to these tasks and what else you need.
Exercise 30
How would you balance concerns for online harms with concerns for freedom of
expression?
Try to draw on as much material from earlier in the book as you can.
For example, how might consideration of virtues and the development of char-
acter be relevant?
How might a consequentialist approach the general question of protecting indi-
viduals versus the good of society? Consider different ways that consequentialism
may characterise the ends at which it aims.

9.10
Key Points
401
Perhaps consider the importance that freedom of expression may have for respect
for persons, including ways in which it might diminish respect and the question of
accountability to others.
Exercise 31
In what ways, if any, does the use of AI impact the age-old question of freedom of
expression and harms to others?
Do you consider there is a matter of degree and scale, or are novel issues raised?
9.10
Key Points
There is a close link between ethical issues and wider social, political, economic,
legal, and regulatory issues. Philosophical work in ethics, as well as work in the
philosophy of language, can contribute to the discussion of the rights and wrongs of
online content moderation. Ethics alone cannot address these questions but can be
part of the necessary dialogues. Attention to ethical issues may assist individuals to
consider their own roles and responsibilities.
The ethical issues raised encompass the software, hardware, and ideologies
behind AI.
Ethical questions that seem entirely novel may have deep historical roots.
The possibilities of new technologies may especially impact how we understand
agency, responsibility, and causation.
We need to compare and contrast human capabilities with AI very carefully.
Striving for consistency may override the application of discretion.
The challenges in using algorithms to moderate online content are of various
kinds, for example, methodological questions, issues concerning the quality and
quantity of data and bias from data labelling by human moderators, as well as
questions concerning the contextual and cultural transmission of meaning via
language.
Training of human moderators may be patchy or nonexistent; conversely, training
may impose questionable uniform standards and undermine discretion and profes-
sional responsibility in moderators.
Many of the issues concerning the use of algorithms and the moderation of online
content
stem
from
the
extremely
poor
conditions
under
which
human
moderators work.
There may be no such thing as a universally agreed ‘right’ answer in the
attribution of meaning and intent to language.

Educator Notes
Students should be encouraged to consider these issues from all sides and to draw on
personal and known examples. This chapter has intentionally omitted illustration
with any speciﬁc examples that may be offensive to some; the general issues of
context and variation in the attribution of meaning can be illustrated with less
controversial examples.
When tackling the exercises, students may have further details, material, and
knowledge they wish to draw upon. For example, there are certain issues that this
chapter has not had time to address at all, or in great detail, such as the question of the
responsibility of technology companies, and whether there is any general right to
access online space. This is a great opportunity to draw links between ethics and
political, legal, and regulatory issues. Precisely because many students may have
examples to draw upon and may feel strongly about the issues from different
perspectives, some may have formed opinions already, so students should be
encouraged to consolidate material from earlier chapters and to draw upon it as
much as possible in their discussions and work here.
Although the chapter contains frequent references to earlier material, students
who have not covered all these previous chapters will still be able to follow the issues
and may wish to refer to speciﬁc sections as indicated.
Section 9.6 and onwards take issues to a slightly deeper level and could be
omitted if needed.
The sections on language, Sects. 9.5.2 and 9.5.3, could also be skimmed or
omitted, but students with particular interests in language may wish to concentrate
on these issues.
At completion of this chapter, students should be able to take an ethical issue
related to the current use of AI and apply the skill and knowledge they have learned
here to produce their own analysis and discussion.
Debate topics and material for extended essays or project work Many of the
exercises raise complex and general points that would serve as good debate and
project topics. For example, Exercises 9, 10, 16, and 18 and the ﬁnal Exercises
29–31.

Towards the Future with AI: Work
and Superintelligence
Abstract This chapter looks at two contrasting ethical issues: work and
superintelligence. We ﬁrst examine the application of AI use within the workplace,
both its use to replace human jobs or tasks, involving the careful comparison of
human and machine agency, analysis of the objectives and values of the workplace,
and a range of other issues. Second, we examine ethical issues arising from the
prospect of widespread technological unemployment. Topics covered include sur-
veillance; assessment of human and machine agency; AI and existing structures of
power; how AI may alter lines of communication and epistemology; how technology
may increase structure and how well it ﬁts into existing informational settings and
infrastructure; control and autonomy; and how beneﬁts of implementing AI are
measured. The discussion of these issues is thus also pertinent to many other
applications of AI. The discussion of superintelligence examines the nature of the
fears surrounding it and possible ways of addressing its dangers. We examine
attempts to ensure that superintelligence aligns with human purposes, noting the
underlying ethical and philosophical framework. Parallels between the ways in
which the control issue of AI occurs and is understood within its use in the
workplace and in relation to superintelligence are indicated.

Introduction
The last chapter looked in some detail at an example of a complex and pressing
contemporary issue in the ethics of AI, the debates over online content and its
moderation. The many interlocking issues that are raised include detailed questions
about how AI may understand human language, how bias is conceptualised, and its
detection and removal, as well as how AI may impact how we behave and treat each
other and how our uses and abuses of AI might impact our very understanding of
ethical issues. While it is true that online content is often used in ways that cause
harm, and often intentionally so, including both minor but also extremely serious
harm, it may also be worth taking pause and reﬂecting on whether the attention given

to online hate might in part be a method of projecting fears about the dangers of AI
onto the human psyche.

Towards the Future with AI: Work and Superintelligence
This chapter considers some more concrete questions in AI ethics, taking our
journey further and further into the future: from the present, to the near future, the
further future and onwards. As we examine future projections for AI, the projection
of fears and dangers onto these possibilities may become more apparent, but we also
see the reverse, projecting a glorious future. But for whom? We have frequently
asked about the relationship between AI and humans. The question will also arise of
the relationship between AI and who? Who will ‘we’ be in the distant future?
Examining various domains will reveal some similar ethical issues, some differ-
ent. As we distance ourselves from the present day, different issues and questions of
methodology will tend to arise, but many also have deep resonance with issues
facing us now. As before, each one of these areas merits detailed examination, and
the discussion here can only cover certain aspects, again concentrating on the
questions which work in ethics might best help us to think about.
We look ﬁrst at questions concerning employment, considering questions that are
currently with us regarding the implementation of AI in the workplace, looking at the
general question of using AI to replace jobs or tasks performed by humans, and at the
impact of the inclusion of various technologies into the workplace. We then examine
concerns about future possibilities: how the impact of AI may change who has work,
shift general patterns of work, and introduce signiﬁcant divisions into society. Like
any projection into the future, this must remain speculative, but examining responses
of both optimism and fear can also reveal a considerable amount about current
thinking.
We next consider artiﬁcial general intelligence (AGI) in the form of
superintelligence and the intense fears that some have expressed, looking at some
aspects both of how the putative problems are characterised and at suggested ways of
remedying or ameliorating dangers—although some, as we shall see, also express
hope. This can be seen as one aspect of the control problem of AI; perhaps, if the
protagonists of certain positions are to be believed, the biggest issue we must face.
Debates about the possibility and dangers of superintelligence include claims about
the nature of artiﬁcial intelligence, its relationship with value, and questions about
how we can observe and discover human values. These necessitate considering
questions about ethical theory, moral epistemology, the very foundation of ethics,
and even how we see and understand each other. To understand these questions, we
need to think about how both AI and humans are understood and imagined, as well
as how they might interact. So although these are, at the moment, dealing the as yet
unrealised future and with entirely theoretical ideas (unless things have changed
considerably by the time of publication!), the ideas and arguments can help us to
think about current questions. In many ways, some of the contemporary issues can
even become clearer when presented in such a stark way, sometimes in ways which
of necessity expose the foundations of artiﬁcial intelligence in attempts to ﬁnd a
solution to the problem of ‘when AI goes bad’. This also exposes foundational
questions in ethics.

10.2
AI in the Workplace
411
When we consider questions that project into the distant future, naturally one
issue we have is uncertainty about what might happen. Other questions arise
regarding how we even think of the ethical issues projecting so far ahead and
under conditions of uncertainty. On the approaches of some ethical theories, this is
less of a problem than on others. Hence, considering these future questions requires
that we think more about the nature of different ethical theories, of questions in
moral epistemology, and how we now stand in relation to the potentially
unrecognisable worlds of the possible futures that may lie open. This chapter can
then act in part as a way of consolidating and building upon material from earlier in
the book.
Questions have been asked about priorities in the ethics of AI: is it a waste of time
to consider the far future when we have more pressing issues? I have already
suggested one answer to this, noting how the discussions around the far future
may help to clarify and expose some of the issues that also pertain to the near future.
We will also consider the stance of Longtermism: the view that we ought, for ethical
reasons, to prioritise the concerns of the far distant future [1]. This position also
raises issues about ethical theory and has implications for how we should approach
some current questions of value.
Worries about superintelligence include the fear that it might completely wipe us
out. Keeping ﬁngers crossed that this does not happen, we will also consider
projected far distant futures with AI, millions of years from now, in which this
does not happen (which can in many ways be seen as a more formalised form of
science ﬁction). These projections also expose foundational ethical questions that
will impact how we think of human beings and AI now and raise questions about
how AI and human beings relate to each other, as well as questions about human
nature, personal identity, the relationship between the mind and the body, the
trajectory of the universe, the role of humans now in curating the future, and ultimate
sources of value.
10.2
AI in the Workplace
Summary
Noting the intimate links between ethics and economics, we look at various ethical
questions concerning the use of AI to replace humans or tasks in the workplace.
Different reasons for the use of AI rather than humans include economics and safety
and the belief that AI will do the task better. This necessitates a careful analysis of
what a workplace task involves, which in turn requires close observation and
exposure of the goals and values of the workplace. Hierarchies at work have a
complex relationship with values and epistemology. AI is also justiﬁed to remove
drudgery, and we examine the value assumptions this makes. We consider the
impact of increased workplace surveillance and data collection.

10.2.1
AI in Work: Some Background
The impacts of AI on work have attracted considerable attention. As we saw in Sect.
2.1, AI is commonly spoken of as ushering in a fourth industrial revolution, after the
ﬁrst which used steam and mechanical power, the second which used electrical
power, and the third which used electronics and the Internet [2]. Naturally, many
important questions thus arise within business, economics, law, and politics, but
among these are ethical issues which include questions about the nature and value of
work, the impact on employees, and the prospects of large-scale unemployment.
Talk of a fourth industrial revolution may be accurate and helpful, but it should
also alert us to watch out for hype and for polarised views that range between fear
and dread, often focusing on fears of widespread technological unemployment [3–
5], to great enthusiasm for a radically changed future with large-scale societal
impacts [6]. With the possibility of such large-scale and wide-ranging impacts on
the economy, the workplace, and society, the questions involved are highly complex,
with many contributing to discussion regarding how we might respond [7–10]. Here,
we focus on some of the ethical issues, looking both at the impact of AI on work
currently or in the near future and then at some of the complex and profound issues
that arise from visions of the future and the possibly large changes in the nature of
work. We will look both at AI in the form of software and also at robotics.
We must not overlook, however, in focusing on some of the ethical questions,
that economic issues are always intimately linked to ethical questions. These include
the distribution of wealth, assumptions about progress, the relative powers of
employees and employers, and the balance of economic values with other values.
The latter issue can be illustrated by concerns in recent years that GDP, Gross
Domestic Product, is only one measure of how well a country is doing and that
there is no clear straight line between economic prosperity and happiness or life
satisfaction. Bhutan’s Gross National Happiness Index has attracted considerable
interest [11].
The ethical issues include the questions of sustainability (see Sect. 2.4.8), an
issue that in AI is closely linked to questions of transparency and control, since many
of the largest problems are less visible and certainly may be opaque to the everyday
user. The immediate costs to those using AI and implementing it in the workforce
may not include a full consideration of the costs to the environment or to workers
elsewhere [12]. Infrastructure pressures frequently force the adoption of AI (e.g. the
many businesses which now only take electronic payments, or which require
prebooking online, place pressure in individuals to use smartphones). Counting
economic costs and environmental impacts is extremely complex: consider the
common call to use an electronic ticket to travel or to attend an event, rather than
asking for a paper ticket. This seems to be an obvious environmental saving to many.
However, it relies on the assumption that one has a smartphone and that it is always
on and charged. It can also slow down queues entering a venue as people attempt to
ﬁnd their ticket barcode in a way that is readable. Therefore, the phone itself and its
use are treated as if cost neutral, rather than looking more systemically at how entire

systems of automation have been constructed and the wider relationships between
extremely large networks of people and machines.
10.2
AI in the Workplace
413
The ethical issues examined here concerning the impact of AI on work include
questions about the dignity of the workforce, the value to society of the work
produced, and many questions concerning control and surveillance. Underlying
questions concern the value of work and of rest, and ultimately, the prospect of
having no work to do leads to questions about purpose in life.
What general questions should we ask regarding the use of AI in the workplace?
As before, it is useful to look closely at the question of why AI is being used, and
perhaps especially in areas where economic imperatives, competition, and infra-
structure changes workplaces increasing pressure to employ AI. Other factors come
into play as well: the steps taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic have
involved increased use of technology at work, which has sped up pressures for
automation, remote working, and the digital economy, among other factors [13]. It is
often assumed that the use of AI in the workplace will usher in greater wealth, speed
up certain tasks, reduce employment costs, and lead to economic gains for those
using it. However, we need to undertake careful comparison between the capabilities
of AI and of human beings and look closely at what precisely a particular job or role
requires. We will also consider multiple possible consequences from the use of AI in
the workplace, which may include increasing surveillance of workers and changes to
how work is valued and carried out.
What concepts and tools can we bring to these questions? In looking at ethical
questions regarding the impact of AI on work, it may be especially useful to consider
certain ideas that we have examined earlier in the book. These include:
The value of persons and respect for persons
Notions of dignity
The question of solidarity
Questions of control and autonomy
How we might measure happiness or human welfare, including questions of what it
is to live a good life
The notion of agency, comparing and contrasting AI and human agency
The values placed on intelligence
The importance of looking closely at precisely what AI is tasked to do
How the use of AI may shift our values
How AI may impact how we communicate
The notion of progress and how we might envisage the future
How ethics intersects with other disciplines

Towards the Future with AI: Work and Superintelligence
10.2.2
Why Use AI Rather Than Humans?
We ﬁrst address the use of AI in the workplace to replace human roles or tasks. There
are a variety of reasons for using AI, and frequently more than one will apply. This
list, of course, may not be exhaustive.
Economic motivations We have already seen some of the reasons for using AI
rather than human beings at work (whether to replace whole jobs or to undertake
certain tasks). Assumptions that this will create greater wealth by increasing pro-
ductivity and lowering costs are often made. This may be the prime driver. This is a
complex economic question that we cannot address here, but even if true, ethical
questions remain about the impact on workers and society at large (including the
sustainability question mentioned above). Even if wealth is not seen as the only, or
the prime, value, there are still questions about how ‘wealth’ is understood as a goal,
and these relate closely to the questions we need to ask about the future prospects for
life in an era of mass technological unemployment, below in Sect. 10.3. We also
have to ask, ‘wealth for whom?’
The work is dangerous for humans Below, we consider the example of the use of
robotics within hospitals. One motivating reason for the use of robotics in hospitals
could be infection control, an issue highlighted by COVID-19. The use of robotics in
instances where humans may be in danger, for example, in bomb disposal, can be
highly beneﬁcial. Moreover, even quite simple robotics can help to prevent work-
place injuries, such as robotics to assist with lifting heavy goods or hospital patients.
(Conversely, industrial robots have killed many people.) Let us take reducing death
and serious injury as a plus, assume the ethical necessity of implementing high safety
standards, and move on to more complex cases.
AI will perform the task better than humans Note ﬁrst that the claim that AI will
perform better than humans is not always made: it may simply be cheaper or more
convenient to use AI, despite drops in performance. This indicates one of the
complexities of understanding ethical issues in using AI in the workplace: the
many different points of view involved. These include ownership, management,
different employees, and customers or clients. There are many tasks at which it is
blatantly obvious that computers, let alone AI, can beat humans: complex calcula-
tions among them. Rising capacities for natural language processing also mean that
tasks involving language, such as checking the content of legal documents, may also
be undertaken much faster using AI. To assess whether AI is performing the task
better, we also need to know what precisely the task is.

10.2.3
Assessing the Use of AI to Replace Human Roles
or Tasks
This will be a complex question upon which much hangs. We cannot give a full
analysis of the complexity here but highlight some important factors with potentially
serious ethical implications.
The task in context Assessing whether AI will perform better than humans will
obviously depend upon what the task is; some tasks may be easier to assess than
others. For example, one major application of AI is in the use of machine learning to
interpret images in medical diagnostics [14]. The accuracy of machine learning can
be measured using various metrics and compared closely to the success rate of
trained humans [15]. In this case, the joint use of humans and of AI in diagnosis may
produce the best results, perhaps because of the complementary abilities: machine
learning can detect features that the human eye cannot, but humans avoid making
some of the drastic errors of misinterpretation to which machine learning may be
prone. However, even in such a seemingly straightforward case, there may be wider
implications for individual employees and across a system stemming from the
adoption of AI, which we examine below.
The complexity of many workplace tasks The ‘ofﬁcial’ description of a work-
place task or role may differ from the actual work undertaken. Much of the value that
may be produced during work and in interactions between workers and customers or
clients may not even be well described as ‘work’. For example, I have frequently
heard those making announcements on train journeys or on railway stations making
amusing comments over the loudspeakers, which has often been very welcome on
delayed journeys but which is doubtless not contained in the job description. The
management may have ideas about the ofﬁcial business of the workplace and the
roles to be undertaken by those in particular roles and at particular times and places,
which do not fully capture what is actually happening. This may especially be the
case in hierarchical work structures where there may be both different points of view
about what is being accomplished and what should be accomplished and blocks to
lines of communication. Much work within organisations may be hidden from view.
Moreover, variation in accounts of what is to be done may be associated with
measurement and outcomes: what can be measured is more likely to be included
in sets of outcomes and objectives than what cannot, or what can be measured only
with difﬁculty. The use of AI, and indeed, the very task of comparing the beneﬁts of
AI to humans, may heighten difﬁculties connected with the measurement of tasks.
Example: the hospital ward I will be illustrating these questions using the exam-
ple of work undertaken within a hospital ward. This will draw upon specialised
material and research, which can thus function as an illustration of how important it
is to draw up on the knowledge and expertise of different disciplines in considering
the ethics of AI in context. The example of healthcare in a hospital setting, however,
will be familiar to many readers and should be of interest and wide concern;

moreover, although speciﬁc understanding of contexts is always needed, many
issues will usefully either generalise to, or contrast with, other workplace contexts.
As before, this draws upon the ﬁndings of some of my colleagues, as well as many
others. In addition, hospitals are sites where tasks of great complexity and great
value are performed, requiring vastly differing skill sets. They are also very hierar-
chical, and they tend to have a management structure that imposes targets for
measuring success. We must note cultural and local differences between hospitals
and wards, but research nonetheless often ﬁnds broad similarities across different
nationalities, and aspects of institutional functioning may remain remarkably similar
over the course of decades [16]. Medicine makes high use of technology, and
nursing also increasingly does so. How might AI come into the mix? Consider, for
example, the proposed use of robotics on the hospital ward [17]. It has been
suggested that hospitals are already well-structured places, designed for the move-
ment of trolleys and so on, and that therefore, they are suitable for the use of robots in
tasks such as delivering food to patients. (Those who have experience with busy
hospital wards might consider that there is a considerable mix of structure and
complexity.) In discussing which jobs are suitable for automation, Frey and Osborne
compare the use of robots in hospitals to the use of robots in agriculture, in
transporting goods, and in mining [3, p. 260]. But just how similar are hospital
patients to crops, coal, iron ore, and uranium?

Towards the Future with AI: Work and Superintelligence
Goods of course do need to be delivered around a hospital, from equipment to
medical samples for analysis to food for patients, but is delivering food to a patient
on a ward really the same manner of task as delivering oil to a truck or even the same
manner of task as delivering pizza to someone’s home address?
Getting the job done One motivating reason for the use of robotics in hospitals
may be staff shortages. In addition, hospitals tend to run according to timetables that
can dominate the life on a ward. The use of robots, or other technologies, may be
considered desirable to keep up with the pace of a busy ward. Research has identiﬁed
two contrasting managerial styles, Pace, of getting things done on time, versus
Complexity, attending more closely to the complex needs of patients [18, 19]. Keep-
ing up with the timetable may be an imperative justifying automation: technology is
at its best, perhaps, in increasing speed and the meeting of targets. Staff on wards
have certain tasks which must be completed, and completed on time. However, is the
task of delivering food to the bedside really just one of refuelling a hungry body?
Even leaving aside the needs some patients have with being helped to eat, the human
interactions that may take place even from brief encounters may be of great value to
patients and others.
Exercise 1
Drawing on your experience either of your own or of friends or family or using your
imagination, how might delivery of food to patients on a hospital ward by robots be
different from delivery by a human being? (Noting, of course, that not all robots and
certainly not all human beings are the same.)

10.2
AI in the Workplace
417
Which if any of these differences related to what might count as the ‘work’ of a
hospital ward? Which are negative, positive, neutral? Where might disputes lie about
which aspects of the delivery of food count as work in a hospital? Compare with a
restaurant, and with home, if this helps.
10.2.4
Workplace Hierarchies and the Nature and Value
of Work
Why look at hierarchy when considering AI ethics? Many, if not most, workplaces
are hierarchical. Often, if there is ofﬁcially a ﬂat structure, this simply masks hidden
hierarchies. The general ethical issues associated with AI can alert us to the issue of
hierarchy. Values of autonomy, dignity, and solidarity are all related, but perhaps it
is the general control question in AI and the importance of understanding how
ethical questions in AI ﬁt into and build upon preexisting ethical questions and
conditions, which should most alert us to the signiﬁcance of hierarchy, for hierar-
chies involve the control by humans of humans. They also critically involve the ﬂow
of information, which will be impacted by the use of AI.
In and of itself, such hierarchical control may be neutral, and can be utterly
critical. For example, knowing one’s role in a system precisely and carrying it out
exactly as needed can be literally life-saving: the ﬁne-tuned analysis of tasks for
different individuals used in Formula 1 racing has been successfully applied to the
operating theatre [20]. Certain staff will have training and experience that gives them
the expertise to oversee others. However, hierarchies may be too rigid and disallow
exceptions. Whistleblowing may be absolutely vital to prevent disasters, including
breaches of ethics, is frequently difﬁcult, and has deleterious consequences for
whistleblowers, precisely because of issues of hierarchy [21]. In other words,
hierarchies act to control the ﬂow of information within an organisation, and this
may not always work to best effect.
Hierarchy and respect for persons Differential status within a workplace need not
at all imply differential respect for the individuals of different status. Unfortunately,
we all know it often does. As we have mentioned before, dehumanisation and loss of
dignity occur very readily. Moreover, studies of workplace and health have found
that workplace hierarchy is strongly linked to health outcomes for conditions such as
cardiovascular disease, with those on lower rungs in work suffering worse outcomes,
and closely associated with workplace stress. Decades of work have resulted in the
conclusion that a key component of this health-damaging stress is responsibility
without control [22]. To illustrate, consider the above examples of a hospital ward: a
nurse will be responsible for meeting timetabled targets such as the delivery of
medicines, but this may take place in an environment with many unexpected
interruptions. This is indeed one motivator for introducing automation.

418
10
Towards the Future with AI: Work and Superintelligence
We need to consider both any existing issues with workplace hierarchies into
which AI arrives, plus the consequences of any changes to the nature of the control
over individuals in the workplace that AI may afford.
Hierarchy and epistemology The ideal is that management knows precisely what
is going on in a workplace and that all tasks are understood and valued, but at least in
certain workplaces, this ideal may not be realised. For example, health care assistants
have been found to have knowledge about patients which may not reach other staff
[23]. One result of this is that it may impact the analysis of the tasks that any AI is
designed to take on. Good communication may help to address this, but the views of
those working in lower grades may not be so readily heard. It is possible to read
many papers on workplace automation and AI that discuss the tasks that AI is to
undertake and come away with the distinct impression that there is only a very
narrow idea of the work undertaken, its complexity, and its value.
If nothing else, this must alert us to the need to ensure widespread participation in
the design and implementation of any such technologies. Analysing and placing a
value on the work carried out may be highly complex. Consider the example we
looked at in Sect. 8.5 concerning how the personhood of individuals may be seen or
overlooked, including the ﬁndings that care over physical appearance and grooming
can contribute to wellbeing, especially for those people who are living with demen-
tia. One might consider that therefore, attention to such issues was part and parcel of
the work of staff offering basic care and that their role in fact involves helping to
maintain personhood, as well as dignity. But will this be seen as part of ‘healthcare’
as such, will an organisation understand its value, and have the resources to value it?
Note, too, that this example relates to health, where ethical aspirations of person-
centred care may be part of the institutional and legal mandate. In other workplaces
and corporations, there may be no such aspiration; indeed, among such workplaces
are some of those most closely associated with the technologies in question.
The importance of such basic care work and attention to the needs of individual
patients may seem very obvious to those involved, including staff, families, and
patients, but note that the research to which I refer has been extensive and has
necessitated the use of careful methodology to produce adequately robust ﬁndings in
an attempt to make a difference to policy and practice; these things are obvious only
to some [24]. Much of the research in this area makes use of qualitative methods
such as ethnography rather than quantitative methods, precisely in order more fully
to capture the meanings of the social world that is being observed [25–27]. However,
this in itself may mean that things that are being observed are less susceptible to the
quantiﬁcation that lends itself more readily to measurement. Moreover, much eth-
nographic work in this context has found that nursing may be understood as
technological and physical work, with the more complex care aspects ignored or
seen as an optional extra by those in charge [18].
Hence, we must be alert to the impact the methods used to analyse workplace
tasks will have on how they are valued and carefully consider the preexisting context
and ethical issues into which AI may be placed. Below, we consider some possible

consequences of the use of AI in relation to its use of data. Might we entrench
existing problematic attitudes?
10.2
AI in the Workplace
419
What is Needed? One Example: Continence Care
Consider the possible uses of robotics on a hospital ward. It is very important
to prevent patients from suffering falls. Moreover, in many healthcare author-
ities, there is a requirement that falls must be recorded and reported, and hence
the prevention of falls forms a clear and important target. Often, this results in
encouraging patients, especially elderly or frail people, to remain in bed, yet
this can have deleterious impacts upon patients. Especially when elderly,
deconditioning can occur very rapidly with bedrest. Moreover, elderly patients
and those living with dementia may be encouraged to use pads rather than to
visit the toilet, even if they are otherwise continent, and this could result in
hospital-acquired continence with lasting and multiple deleterious impacts
[28]. This is a far from obvious consequence of the understandable and well-
intentioned safety concerns and measurable targets of the ward.
Staff may have time pressures which prevent them from assisting patients
on the toilet. Could the use of robotics to help certain patients to safely get out
of bed and to assist them in the toilet instance with standing and sitting, be
useful? The use of robots rather than a real human may mean the personal
touch is lost in many tasks; but here it could protect privacy. Note then, as we
have remarked earlier, sometimes what we need is to reproduce human factors;
sometimes what we need is to omit them.
This is simply a suggestion: the purpose is to illustrate the complexity of
these matters, and the interdisciplinary and contextual work needed for the
design and use of technology that genuinely amounts to progress.
10.2.5
The Claim that AI Will Relieve Humans of Drudgery
This is a very commonly expressed reason for workplace automation: that many jobs
amount to drudgery, but automation heralds the way out. Certain jobs are seen to be
demeaning, beneath human dignity, or demoralising, either inherently or in practice.
Yet again, we must examine how AI may be superimposed upon existing attitudes
and values. It is certainly true that many jobs are dangerous, extremely hard work,
may be tedious and unfulﬁlling, and that workers may be treated badly and with
disrespect. Some of these jobs came into existence with the ﬁrst, second, and third
industrial revolutions. Can the fourth industrial revolution then ﬁnally sort us out?
Given that many jobs that have been created by AI are also tedious, repetitive, poorly
paid, and often remote work that may be isolating and unsupported, such as labelling
images and content moderation, one might wonder if around the corner there is a
ﬁfth industrial revolution—or counterrevolution—which might ﬁx the dismal jobs
created by AI.

420
10
Towards the Future with AI: Work and Superintelligence
A job that seems pointless can also readily lose its appeal; it has been argued that
very many jobs are indeed simply ‘bullshit’, providing little purpose or satisfaction
for those employed in them [29]. Drudgery in jobs may be in part a factor of how
jobs are organised, rather than the inherent nature of the task. A task that is repeated
for 8 or 10 h straight may easily become drudgery. However, there may be many
assumptions about what constitutes worthwhile work suitable for human beings. We
have seen that the notion of human dignity can be a useful marker of the maltreat-
ment of others but that it is harder to deﬁne and specify (see Sect. 2.4.9). Considering
that AI will free us from jobs that are beneath human dignity may seem like a grand
ideal, but there is likely to be disagreement about which jobs and tasks these are, and
whether or not we need new technologies to come to the rescue, or whether much of
the problem is caused by organisational, economic, and societal issues. Furthermore,
the assumption that certain jobs are drudgery, or beneath human dignity, may be
based upon denigrating attitudes towards those who currently perform them.
It is notable that some of the uses of AI that have sparked the majority of recent
concerns are those that threaten white collar jobs, such as law and accountancy.
There are certainly aspects of certain jobs that might become tedious to some; but the
very same jobs may be many other people’s dream jobs. People have considerably
different kinds of interest and derive satisfaction and experience annoyance and
stress from many different things. Some job roles that are already vanishing owing to
automation are service jobs such as shop assistant or waiting on tables. One might
wonder if those developing and deploying AI in the workplace have particular
attitudes towards work that may not be shared.
Exercise 2
How would you deﬁne and measure ‘drudgery’ in work?
Recall the discussion of different ways of understanding happiness and unhappi-
ness (Sect. 6.2.1). How might one’s assessment of the drudgery or unpleasantness of
a job—or the reverse—be affected by applying a hedonistic approach or a
eudaimonic approach that measures happiness over a whole lifetime?
You might have fun trying to apply Bentham’s feliciﬁc calculus (see Sect. 2.5.2)
to a few jobs, and perhaps compare results with others.
10.2.6
Seeing Work Through a Technological Lens
When the use of AI is portrayed as being morally beneﬁcial on the premise that it is
saving humans from certain tasks and occupations, one must pay attention to the
possibility that unless this assessment of these jobs is correct, then certain tasks may
be further devalued, and this then may devalue those who fulﬁl these roles. Burn out
from stress is associated with feeling that one has not been able to do a good job for
patients or had adequate support from colleagues, among other factors [30], and
working in an environment where the job of nursing is seen as focused on technical
and physical tasks will tend to omit any time for personal care.

10.2
AI in the Workplace
421
The ethical aims of an institution may ﬁnd little place in workplace tasks We
have seen above that the ‘ofﬁcial’ organisational analysis of what a task involves
may omit certain elements. In the example used, of nursing, this is salutary to
understanding and valuing the work because the elements that tend to get overlooked
are often those human or relational elements that not only make a difference for
patients but also make a large difference for staff job satisfaction; moreover, these
elements may actually be a necessary part of fulﬁlling goals of the institution, such as
patient-centred care. Note that this is an ethical aspiration! Institutions may state
such laudable aims without the wherewithal or the real organisational will to
accomplish them.
Hence, the same, or very similar, technically focused analyses of jobs that
emphasise measurement of outcome, may be behind the lack of job satisfaction
which then is used to ground arguments for automation; it may also perhaps increase
the gulf between an organisation’s actual functioning and some of its ethical ideals.
Nonetheless, this issue is complex because there are many sound reasons for
measuring certain outcomes and targets and many practical constraints on organisa-
tions. There will almost certainly be different points of view on this, from manage-
ment, outside auditors, staff, patients, clients, customers, and so on. These groups
will all have different responsibilities and lines of accountability. It is important to
bear in mind that different workplace organisations have rather different sets of
responsibilities and lines of accountability to their clientele, the wider public, and
society in general. Hospitals are, or should be, workplaces with high and speciﬁc
ethical standards.
Measurement of performance indicators is well known to skew outcomes as
targets are chased [31]. Indeed, performance metrics are likely to skew work in AI
ethics, since academics are under great pressure to produce visible measures of
performance, such as publications in certain journals and citation counts. The
dangers are everywhere.
Moralising attitudes towards certain jobs and tasks that may then be seen as ripe
for automation may be seen in work that is thought of as ‘dirty’ work, involving
basic care of the body and tasks such as dealing with bodily wastes [32, 33]. Such
work is stigmatising for both those cared for and for those carrying out the work and
is closely associated with low status within workplace hierarchies. So-called ‘dirty’
work may be associated with gender, race, and class [34, 35]. These issues are thus
highly associated with preexisting ethical issues of equality and dignity. Whilst not
denying the challenges that the work may entail, one could regard such bodily care
work for the most vulnerable among us who need such care, as among the highest
and most noble form of work a human being could do, and as a manifestation of the
striving to maintain human dignity.
Calling certain tasks ‘basic care’ may be seen to imply that it is a low-grade,
unimportant activity compared to the overall goals of the medical institution.
However, this can be ﬂipped to seeing it as utterly fundamental to how human
beings live and relate to each other.

What’s the worst job you’ve ever had? Would technology have helped to improve
your work experience in any way, and if so, how?
Exercise 4
Take an example of the introduction of AI in any workplace, real or imagined.
Consider how lines of communication, capacity to act, and responsibilities may be
impacted from the point of view of different employees, management, and clients.
10.2.7
The Claim that the Use of AI Will Enable Work to Be
More Humanised
This is linked to the claim that AI may relieve us of drudgery. It has been claimed
that the use of AI in the workplace will speed up certain tasks (be they complex or
routine) so that staff can spend more time engaged in cultivating good relationships.
For example, if tasks of diagnosis are undertaken more swiftly, then it is hoped that
doctors may be able to devote more time to explaining the results to patients and
addressing their concerns. For this to happen, it is likely that speciﬁc steps may need
to be taken institutionally to achieve this. For instance, one cannot assume that a
doctor who has incredible diagnostic skills has an equally good ‘bed-side manner’
and great communication skills. Further training may be needed.
This will also depend greatly on local context and cultures and what the task of an
organisation is seen to be [36]. An institutional culture of meeting performance
targets and of appearing to be ‘busy’ may clash with being seen to ‘waste’ time in
‘nonwork’ activities such as personal interactions and amusements. For instance, and
depending on local culture and hierarchies, a nurse may be scolded for taking time in
a moment of relative quiet to interact socially with patients [37, p. e3]. However,
many patients are extremely isolated and under-stimulated on hospital wards, which
may be lonely and distressing places. There will doubtless be variation in how such
issues are managed. There is much that goes in within hospitals and clinics that
extends beyond any ofﬁcial description of diagnosis and treatment [38].
10.2.8
Other Possible Outcomes of the Introduction of AI
We have considered in general how the implementation of AI within a speciﬁc
workplace context may subtly skew the framework of values and goals through
which the work is seen and evaluated. AI may be helpful in increasing the speed with
which certain tasks are accomplished and in increasing levels of control and consis-
tency over certain aspects of work. Hence, it will be helpful to consider how
questions of efﬁciency, speed, productivity, and control may also have complex
effects that may not always be uniformly welcome.

10.2
AI in the Workplace
423
Surveillance and control at work Recall that a major concern of the Luddites was
not the use of machinery per se but the ways in which it enabled greater management
control over workers and productivity (see Sect. 2.5.2). We also saw above how
changes in the control of tasks and of information need to be considered in possibly
shifting lines of accountability, responsibility, and agency. Note how workplaces
may be judged suitable for automation if they are structured in the right ways
[3]. This then presents the possibility of increasing or modifying existing structures
at work in order to facilitate the implementation of AI. This may have considerable
unintended impacts, including on the capacity for control, for autonomy and free-
dom of movement and decision-making, and for lines of communication. The use of
AI at work may readily increase the degree of surveillance over the workforce,
largely through enabling the collection of large amounts of data.
Naturally, people have their own strategies for navigating such lines of control
within the workplace. For example, when word processors (for those who remember
this now archaic technology) were ﬁrst introduced into use in typing pools, this
enabled management (often men) to check remotely if the staff (mostly women)
were working continuously. Word processor operators quickly discovered that by
holding down a key with one ﬁnger, it would appear to management as if one was
hard at work, while in fact chatting to one’s neighbour [39]. Likewise, turning off
video and audio ‘because my connection is slow’ enables one to do the washing up
or whatever while appearing to pay attention to an online work meeting. Again, the
issue of worker control and surveillance is not new. This was one of the concerns of
the Luddites, as we saw in Sect. 2.5.2. Nonetheless, the opportunities for surveil-
lance of workers have greatly increased, and in speciﬁc ways enabled by speciﬁc
technologies. Moreover, some uses of technology may also increase the surveillance
of customers, such as the Amazon Go stores, where bills are automatically calculated
[40]. What ethical issues arise?
Consider how this issue may be approached from very different points of view.
Consider also the different ethical theories and value concepts that we have
discussed earlier in the book. From the point of view of management, who may
wish to increase productivity, the main question may appear to be consequentialist
in form: what are the beneﬁts? Does it increase workplace productivity? Does it have
a downside in terms, for example, of burnout or staff turnover? From the point of
view of staff, the issues involved would include privacy, dignity, and control. From
the point of view of both, issues of communication arise.
The very different points of view and purposes for which such technology is used
are also closely connected with a major ethical issue with technology in general, that
much of it can be applied for both good and ill purposes: the question of ‘dual use’.
AI poses this problem very acutely, since so much of it is cheap and easy to replicate
once developed, and since so much of it could be applied very generally [41].
Exercise 5
During the pandemic, AI technology was developed that could monitor social
distancing at work [42]. This also has the feature that it could be potentially ‘dual
use’, introduced for one purpose but retained for another. Such technology could

map an individual’s movements around the workplace and their distance from each
other, potentially identifying members of staff. The system would determine if
individuals’ spatial distance from each other violated certain criteria, and breaches
of this would be reported.
424
10
Towards the Future with AI: Work and Superintelligence
Consider any potential ethical issues, including good and bad points, from the
point of view of both staff and management. Consider management responsibilities,
e.g. for health and safety at work.
Responsibility at work: Data collection, surveillance, control, and liability One
concern of the increased possibilities of data collection at work is potentially
changing lines of responsibility and accountability. For example, some surgeons
have expressed concern that the use of robots within the operating theatre may lead
to increased liabilities for doctors, since a wealth of data will be collected about
behaviour during surgery [43]. At any rate, there may be intricate questions of legal
liabilities [44]. There are often thorny issues of the distribution of responsibility
within lengthy and complex chains of production involving multiple different
individuals and divisions within and between organisations. The introduction of
AI may add considerably to these complexities, especially as AI developed by one
group for one purpose may later be applied for another purpose, and especially as
there are often nested patterns of development in such technology. Moreover, AI
may subtly affect the nature and degree of control that individuals and groups have
and may impact how information is understood and shared, adding further
difﬁculties.
The allure of technology may rub off onto workers As we have repeatedly seen,
it is necessary to consider not simply what AI is capable of doing but also how it is
seen and imagined. There is a certain allure about technology that can rub off onto
the workers who are in control of it and those who utilise skills in deploying it, and
consequently, those workers who do not use it, or who are simply answerable to its
demands, may lose status. This can then steepen the gradient of workplace hierarchy
and may feed back into some of the issues discussed immediately above. For
example, this seems to have happened with the introduction of technology into
nursing. As the nursing role uses more and more technology, tasks that are consid-
ered basic care are more likely to be reserved for grades of staff lower on the
hierarchy and the pay role, with consequences for their status within the
workplace [23].
Productivity and values We looked above at hopes that workplace automation
may free up workers’ time by increasing productivity, using the example of the use
of AI in medical diagnosis. This forms a useful example of complexities that may
arise. Increased facility at diagnosis is likely to greatly increase the amount of
diagnosis taking place, and could well increase the number of false positives, may
increase the number of minor conditions being diagnosed which raises demands on
the medical system as a whole. In other contexts, the use of AI and other technol-
ogies may have knock-on effects, which are measured as increases in productivity.

‘Productivity’ needs to be considered carefully in medicine, alongside not just the
capacities of the medical system but also the end goal: the value of health.
10.2
AI in the Workplace
425
Health is a very good example of how technology may put pressure on our values
and goals, partly because it seems such a central and important value that it may be
assumed that attempting to increase health will always be a good. But the precise
deﬁnition and boundaries of health can be hard to draw; recall that we mentioned the
concepts of medicalisation and of iatrogenesis earlier (see Sect. 3.3.4).
Exercise 6
Robot waiters have been around for some time. One alleged advantage is that their
use may increase revenues for restaurants by making it more likely that a customer
will order an extravagant dessert. This can be seen as a form of ‘reverse surveil-
lance’, where human beings can make decisions in the absence of the shaming eyes
of others. On the one hand, this appears to be there is free choice operating on both
sides. Indeed, it may seem to increase the freedom of customers to make decisions
without human moral judgement. But is this all that could be said? Is this even a
moral issue? Consider how one might assess the ethical impacts for restaurants and
for customers, as well as the wider impacts for society.
What is the workplace? Relationships between people We have seen how AI is
involved in questions of control, for example, through data collection, which impact
lines of accountability. Technology enables both connection and distance since the
very possibilities of communication allow for physical distancing. This indeed is
happening on a wide scale with remote working, which increased dramatically as
part of policies of lockdown; indeed, without the possibilities of remote working and
communication, lockdowns could not have taken place in the precise manner in
which we saw in many parts of the world. The potential implications of workers
remaining at home rather than going into work are profound, complex, and very
likely mixed in terms of good and bad. Moreover, there are knock-on effects on
transport, housing, and infrastructure.
Exercise 7
By now many of you will have probably had considerable experience of remote
meetings by video call. Are there any ethical issues involved in the different
possibilities and constraints on how we communicate and relate remotely compared
to in person?
Transparency, performance outcomes, and technological uniformity Shifting
goals in the workplace may also occur owing to lack of transparency in how ﬁndings
are reached. Char et al., writing in the New England Journal of Medicine, have
expressed concern that bias and lack of transparency in algorithms used in healthcare
may impact what they call the collective medical mind [45]. There are likely to be
biases that may impact treatment decisions for individuals and certain groups; it is
known that medical data and trials have underrepresentation by females and many
ethnic groups, yet these factors may be critical in medical decision-making. How-
ever, these biases unfortunately exist prior to the implementation of AI. Worries are

expressed about the possibility of further skewing the practice of medicine, espe-
cially given the drives towards the measurement of performance outcome and the
pressures that management and other interests therefore may be under. Improve-
ments to quality metrics may or may not reﬂect better care. Uniformity of opinion
may be encouraged by the use of a technical system for the production of medical
knowledge, which may mean we pay a high price if this contains errors [46];
currently, it is generally recognised that there are reasonable disagreements within
the body of medical experts. These disagreements frequently provide the impetus for
improvements, including revising commonly accepted practices.
426
10
Towards the Future with AI: Work and Superintelligence
Structure and uniformity The need for structure arises with the merging of data
sets, which is often required given the vast amount of data needed in AI and machine
learning. An example of this is medical records, which are currently often held on
computer systems that lack compatibility, and in addition, there may be differences
in how medical information is understood, classiﬁed, and recorded [47]. Without
addressing incompatibilities, data will lack accuracy; yet imposing a uniform stan-
dard on recording data may also introduce problems with bias, inaccuracy, and in the
dominance of certain ways of understanding medicine and of the world. The
understanding, classiﬁcation, and diagnosis of disease and the experience of symp-
toms vary from place to place and over time and are known to be impacted by factors
such as culture and gender [48]. Yet without uniformity of records, merging data
from different sources may be riven with problems.
Deskilling Among the concerns about the use of AI in the workplace is the
possibility of deskilling. The concerns of Char et al. may indicate one route through
which this could occur. Conversely, the use of AI will frequently require the
acquisition of new skills.
10.2.9
A Word on Methods
As with the last chapter, this discussion does not walk you through a ﬁxed set of
‘methods’ for analysing the issues and reaching the ‘right’ answer: indeed, the more
analysis and thinking we do, the more we may realise that there is no ‘right’ answer,
only compromise. However, there are some pointers to lines of inquiry to follow.
One of these is to try to ensure a thorough understanding of the situation into
which AI is to be placed. There are certain key issues—fault lines, one might say—
where AI may potentially have most capacity to disrupt, either for good, for bad, or
more likely, in mixed ways. The issue of control in AI is, as we have seen, a major
concern, and this means that we need to understand the issues of control in the
situation and contexts into which AI will be placed. The general question of how
precisely to understand the tasks involved and a close comparison of human agency
and capacities with those of AI are ever-present. Where questions arise of how
human beings are treated—dignity, respect for persons, autonomy—i.e. in almost all
cases, understanding how dignity, respect for persons, and autonomy are manifest in

the preexisting situation and carefully considering the ways in which these will be
impacted by AI (which will doubtless include unexpected ways) will always be
useful.
10.2
AI in the Workplace
427
This also means that we must think carefully about lines of responsibility that are
likely to be affected, since not only will the capacity of individuals to act within a
system often be impacted but also the lines of communication within that system.
This then also means that strategies such as considering the operation of hierarchies
and how goals, purposes, and values may be variously understood from different
perspectives may be useful, as will considering the matter from the points of view of
different individuals and categories of people in a social and technological system.
Subject matter expertise and personal experience The necessity of close con-
sideration of the preexisting situation into which AI may be deployed necessitates
considerable subject matter expertise, and the example of the setting of the hospital
demonstrates that this may be a contested issue, with multiple points of view, and
knowledge not so straightforward to acquire. This means close collaboration with
others but also the need to be wary of simply accepting certain dominant views. The
example of a hospital setting drew upon a body of research by outside observers
about the workings of the ward.
One reason why I also used this example was because my personal experience of
working as a healthcare assistant alerted me to the strength of hierarchy within such a
setting and the complexity of lines of communication within this workplace. How-
ever, in contributing to discussions of issues in practical ethics, I have often been
alarmed at the very fact that the only reason I have some understanding of a certain
aspect of a situation, or am alerted to asking certain questions, is because of personal
experience which I just randomly have acquired by the ﬂuke of life circumstances.
This has frequently made me wonder what else is being missed.
Ethical theory The different ethical theories and concepts that we have examined
in this book, such as consequentialism, deontological approaches, virtue ethics, and
accounts of the value of persons, if applied to the different questions examined here,
will each tend to produce different answers and expose different factors of the
situation. Sometimes these will be more compatible with certain points of view of
the issues than with others. Sometimes the answers may cohere with each other,
sometimes they may clash. Sometimes there can be valuable lessons in understand-
ing the clashes, as this may lend understanding to why certain disagreements are
irrevocable, but they may help to open the way to acceptable compromise or to better
understanding, even despite continued disagreements.

Future visions of widespread automation include the possibility of extensive tech-
nological unemployment and hence of social divisions. Such possibilities require us
to consider the value of work as process and product, of rest and leisure for
individuals and for society, and of the impacts of a possible two-tier society,
including the increased levels of social and economic control. Questions of the
meaning and purpose of life inevitably follow.
So far, we have addressed questions around the impact of AI in the workplace that
concern elements of technology that are either currently being used or feasibly may
soon be. Addressing these questions involves close consideration of aspects of the
precise capacities of the technology, the software, the hardware, the purposes for
which it is used, and the precise context of use. There are also interesting ethical
questions raised about the motivating ideologies behind AI and the hopes and fears
projected onto it, including hopes and fears for the trajectory of humanity as
technological progress unfolds.
As we have seen, concerns about the impact of technology upon employment are
not new, and indeed, it is possible to see some of the expressed hopes that AI may
free us from drudgery as motivated in part by the drudgery brought in by previous
industrial revolutions.
Prominent among those writing in the nineteenth century about the nature of work
and the downsides of industrialisation were William Morris and John Ruskin and, of
course, Marx [49–51]. Moreover, as we saw earlier, the ancient Greek philosophers
Plato and Aristotle made much mention of craftwork and its values.
William Morris: Useful Work and Useless Toil
Morris (1834–1896) was actively involved in arts and crafts as well as in
manufacturing, and has some association with the Arts and Crafts Movement
[52]. He considered that work was a human necessity, but that not all work was
good; some was ‘useless toil’ producing nothing of real worth. Work should
not only be productive of real value, but should also be a source of satisfaction
to the individual workers. Sources of satisfaction, according to Morris, include
the intrinsic pleasures from extension of effort and skill in work, the value of
the product or service, and the hope of rest resultant on productive work
rewarded as such. The mass production of factories prevented workers from
gaining satisfaction from their work. He had many criticisms of the contem-
porary capitalist system of production, including the inequality and waste it
produces, and the uniformity and substandard nature of many products thus
produced. Morris set up his own factory, producing craft items such as fabrics
(continued)

and wallpapers (which are still widely on sale today, and, ironically, mass-
produced). He is also known for his failure to live up to his ideals of worker
autonomy and creativity within his factory (but how many of us do in fact live
up to our own ideals).

AI, Employment and Unemployment, and Future Visions
429
High among the concerns about the impact of automation on employment are the
possibilities of widespread technological unemployment and the impact this might
then have upon individuals, the class of the unemployed, and society as a whole
[3, 4, 7, 9, 53]. Naturally, projections for such scenarios vary widely; some differ-
ence may be made to projections by whether one is concerned with the disappear-
ance of jobs or of speciﬁc tasks and whether one considers the creation of new jobs
or the increase in certain types of task. Those with fears frequently point out that,
previously, technology had threatened manual jobs; now, it is white collar jobs that
are threatened. Perhaps, since the people writing these reports also have white collar
jobs, this impacts how the threat is seen.
It is also anticipated by some that increased automation will lead to an increase in
wealth and productivity. This raises certain questions: questions about sustainability,
about how this wealth and productivity is valued, and about how it is distributed.
Wealth inequalities associated with technology are already plainly apparent: to the
control question in AI, we must include not simply the bare capacities of the
technology to control but the powers of control enjoyed by the vastly wealthy
corporations based upon their sheer economic value and reach into the economy,
especially given the continued entrenchment of these technologies into the
infrastructure.
Other projections, fears, and hopes concern the nature of employment in the
future. Some are optimistic, projecting that there will be a greater emphasis on
service work and work involving human contact and interaction, given that other
more mundane tasks will be taken over by technology (as discussed earlier). Another
projection is that with increased wealth and increased buying capacities, there will be
greater demand for handmade crafts and appreciation of the individuality and work
these involve. Conversely, there are fears for the rise in unsatisfying jobs and for
greater control and surveillance over the workforce (indeed this is already happen-
ing, as we have seen).
So yet again we see the polarity between hopes for greatness, the possibilities for
technology to enable humanity to ﬂourish, and its reverse. For how can the tedious,
repetitive, minimal autonomy jobs that AI has enabled, and which with bad luck may
persist, plausibly be consistent with a vision of inspiring and leading humanity into a
glorious AI-led future where our capacities and intelligence are fully realised?
The questions concerning future projections for the impact of automation on
employment obviously require input from the realms of economics and politics (and
so likely to be highly contested), among other areas. We need to examine the nature
of work and evaluate how it might be changed, including its distribution. The notion
of work and its implications for the value of the individual and for society as a whole

has attracted considerable attention and theorisation, from very different points of
view. Moreover, there are cultural, ideological, and religious views to address:
consider, for instance, the Protestant Work Ethic which sprung up in Europe
following the Reformation, which has many critics (including those who dispute
its origins) [54]. So this again is an area where the ethical questions have to be asked
and addressed in a complex and interdisciplinary area which is also highly contested.
Nonetheless, work or its absence is something that is part of common human
experience and hence something on which we all might have opinions and
understanding.

Towards the Future with AI: Work and Superintelligence
Consider the question of whether work is an essential aspect of the human
condition and how AI may impact how we address this question, including how
we evaluate the impact of AI. Recall our discussion of human nature, especially Sect.
5.4.5, where we discussed whether there is an essence to human nature. Two
possible accounts mentioned may be particularly relevant here: Homo Ludens and
Homo Faber. Indeed, these are not necessarily incompatible. Maybe we produce
things as an essential requirement of life, in order to rest and play. Or perhaps these
can be combined: perhaps some vision of work along the lines that William Morris
envisaged might be able to incorporate a play element into working life. If we
consider the processes involved in work, or which ideally could be involved in
work, such as the exertion of intellectual, physical, emotional, and creative effort
towards some valuable and rewarded goal, we might hold out hopes that an ideal
situation of work might represent an important part of a life well lived.
We should also consider the value of work from the point of view of the process
of work, what is produced (including service roles), and the social settings surround-
ing work. Recall the normative ethical theories we discussed in Chap. 6 and the
different aspects that are stressed by different accounts: the end results, how an end
result is obtained, the shape and value of a life judged as a whole, and questions of
relationships, among other things.
Visions of plenty and technological accomplishment abound in future projections
of the impact of AI on work. The very idea that technology will meet our needs
completely, end poverty, illness, and war, projects a world far different from the one
we currently occupy. Is the idea that work is a necessity of life a merely contingent
claim, which could vanish given the achievements of technology? Recall our
discussions of the object of morality in Sect. 4.3.1 and of the background conditions
against which the general shape of ethical norms is formed. One might be tempted to
dismiss such an optimistic—or pessimistic—projection as the kind of fantasy that
blights technology. It is nonetheless worth considering, since it forces us to ask not
simply a technical and limited question about how to ﬁne-tune our ethics and values,
but a deeply profound question: what is the purpose of life? How do we ﬁnd value?
Why are we even here? It also requires us to address the question of how we would
even go about trying to ﬁnd an answer, were the world to become so different.
Recall our discussion about the background assumptions that shape ethics and
ethical theory. Among these are indeed the necessity of effort, the need for certain
basic necessities, and the uncertainties of the world. We mentioned Kant’s argu-
ments in his Groundwork for the Metaphysics of Morals for certain duties

[55]. Perfect duties are identiﬁed by reasoning that their negation results in a
contradiction: no rational agent could will that whenever it was convenient, a person
made a lying promise because the very concept of a promise requires a commitment
to keep the promise, even if it is inconvenient. A formal contradiction arises since the
imagined situation is incoherent. (Leave aside for now the many criticisms of how
precisely Kant arrived at this conclusion.) Imperfect duties are ones the violation of
which does not rest upon a formal contradiction but which no rational agent could
will because it would conﬂict with what any person might well need at some point
throughout their lives to fulﬁl the general goals that all rational agents have.
Therefore, Kant argues, no rational agent would will that he or she never did
anything to develop his or her talents, since the world is such that skills are needed.
10.3
AI, Employment and Unemployment, and Future Visions
431
Exercise 8
Try to imagine how different our values might be, if gaining the basic requirements
of life, and indeed, even any luxury one might wish for, was readily provided by
technology.
The answers to these and other questions may have implications for the very ways
in which we value and deploy AI, understand and value intelligence, and value
human beings. Recall our discussions in Sect. 5.2 concerning different ways of
understanding and valuing intelligence. If we have an instrumental account, and so
value intelligence because it helps us reach our goals, and we end up in a world
where these goals are all reached by machines, not by us, do we end up coming to the
realisation that while using machines to achieve these goals is certainly very
valuable, we also value intelligence intrinsically because we enjoy the process, the
exertion of effort, the sense of achievement of being able to reach an answer oneself?
One might suspect that those who herald an age of widespread technological
unemployment are imagining that they themselves will still be working, moreover,
in high-status, high-reward, highly satisfying tech jobs. One might also suspect that
those driven to work in artiﬁcial intelligence ﬁnd the task interesting and challenging
because they themselves gain considerable reward from the exercise of their own
intelligence.
10.3.1
Technological Unemployment and Social Divisions
Many discussions of technological unemployment envisage that there will be a part
of the population employed and a part that is unemployed. This in itself is curious,
for one might suppose in an age of vast access to intelligence, whether natural or
artiﬁcial, one might have hoped that a way of distributing work more evenly could
have been found, especially given values of AI ethics codes and guidelines
emphasising solidarity and beneﬁt to all. That many future visions do not include
this perhaps tell us something about imagined pictures of progress and about the
control aspects of AI. Those who have control of AI, in such scenarios, have control
of wealth, and of a great deal more.

432
10
Towards the Future with AI: Work and Superintelligence
Two major ethical questions arise: the inequalities that arise from such a stark
division into two classes of humanity and the question of how people in the
unemployed class are going to occupy themselves. Examining an imagined and
extreme possibility of two separate classes in society can also be useful for consid-
ering how similar issues might play out in a more muted version, also known as
real life.
The inequalities centrally include the question of control because in many
imagined situations, the unemployed are dependent upon others for income, and
indeed, for the goods and services that might, if they are lucky, help to render their
lives meaningful or at any rate keep them occupied. Even if incomes are distributed
fairly evenly among all, both employed and unemployed, disparities still persist in
the form of disparities of control, power, and status. One of the most robust ﬁndings
in social science is that relative inequality is a good predictor of criminal behaviour,
including violence. Inequality is also closely linked to health disparities.
How might a possible rise in crime be addressed? Using AI, perhaps. Since there
is likely to be considerable surveillance and data collection of individuals, some
manner of social credit system to encourage certain behaviours and discourage
others could readily be implemented. If a group is entirely dependent for income
on a government and the continued dominance of technology, and there are no
alternatives—no frontier land left to go and ﬁnd a patch of earth to farm—then the
level of control possible over lives could be immense, especially with the introduc-
tion of digital currency. (Black markets and crime are virtually inevitable of course.)
Perhaps alternatively or additionally, AI, including persuasive technology and other
ways of manipulating behaviour and emotions, might be used to combat negative
behaviour in individuals and groups. Indeed, why not use this on the employed
as well? This question is complicated by the fact that negative feedback on anti-
social behaviour is part and parcel of a well-functioning society. What will come to
be seen as acceptable or as inevitable? See our discussion of online content moder-
ation in Chap. 10 for many similar issues.
Exercise 9
Could such a system to control the population and achieve social harmony and
desirable behaviour be ethical? Of course, this is an immense question, but as an
exercise, consider this from consequentialist, deontological, and virtue ethics points
of view and consider questions such as autonomy and respect for persons. Ask also
what other considerations and disciplines need to be brought to the discussion.
10.3.2
Keeping Occupied in a Time of Unemployment
In the 1970s, a speaker came to our school to show us plans for a vast leisure park to
be built in some of the extensive green space within London, on the premise that
when we all grew up, machines would be doing most of the work. The park was
never built, and many of us worked more hours than our parents did. Nonetheless, if

AI does indeed manage to create vastly more leisure time, we will need some way of
ﬁlling it.
10.3
AI, Employment and Unemployment, and Future Visions
433
Many may think that there is little to worry about ﬁnding something to
do. Countless retired people remark that they cannot understand how they ever
found time to go to work. Housework expands to ﬁll the time available, many say,
and likewise, humans are endlessly dreaming up new projects and things to be
interested in. Nonetheless, for others, the prospect of not having enough to do is
deeply unpleasant. In any case, the question must be asked if the things that the
unemployed have to do to occupy themselves include things of value. For human
beings, social creatures, whether our pursuits are valuable in the eyes of others is also
frequently important.
Some imagine that we will be endlessly entertained, including with computerised
games and virtual reality, a more passive role perhaps, although AI and VR will
enable forms of participation and agency. Some have imagined that this will free us
for endless creativity, an active role. Some imagine that even creativity will not be
needed, since AI will be able to create art, music, literature, anything we wish, and
will be better than us at the task. We can have literature specially created to suit our
temperament and interests. We will be consumers rather than producers. Those who
ﬁnd pleasure in discovery can simply read all the knowledge that AI is rapidly
creating for us.
Exercise 10
Drawing on any material that you regard as relevant, consider if there would be any
loss if we all became consumers of the products of creative endeavours produced by
machines, rather than creators.
Again, the questions we have raised concerning the nature of happiness are highly
relevant here, including questions of higher and lower pleasures (see Sects. 2.5.2 and
6.2.1). These questions speak to some of the profound divisions between different
attitudes to the value of our lives that we have seen in many philosophers. A hedonic
account of happiness might suggest a world of passing enjoyable experiences, which
simply add up and accrue over a lifetime. Other accounts look to purpose, to
character development, and to ﬁnding a source of meaning over the course of a
lifetime. There are also traditions both philosophical and religious, where a life of
contemplation is seen as of great value, on some views, the highest form of life.
Perhaps this is the future that awaits us; perhaps some of the technologically
unemployed may be able to live the kind of revered lives that those dedicated to
contemplation and spiritual pursuits have enjoyed and do enjoy in many cultures and
times of history. The ethical issues merge seamlessly into questions about the search
for the meaning of our lives and into questions posed by religious and traditions of
spirituality.
Exercise 11
Consider and discuss:
An answer to any scruples about the world which awaits us should widespread
technological unemployment occur might be this: there is no ﬁxed human nature.

Hence, the value we attach to notions such as autonomy and freedom will be a thing
of the past. Freedom of thought was valuable only when human beings did not have
access to robustly reliable routes to knowledge. Freedom to act as you please was
only valuable in a situation of uncertainty over the best course of action in life. In this
future world, these values will be surpassed. The teething problems with online
content moderation will be solved, and by tackling this, we will have amassed
sufﬁcient expertise reliably to assess content for misinformation. The boundaries
between the real and the unreal will be malleable since so much of our time is spent
living in a world of virtual reality and deepfakes. Moreover, since AI is based upon
an instrumental account of intelligence, the value of intelligence itself, including the
value of truth and of knowledge, is also instrumental, merely for any good it
produces. The real itself matters not. So whether we are actually experiencing a
leisure activity or not will not matter to us, and we will be able to rely on AI to
prevent us from receiving the fake news that is damaging.

Superintelligence, Existential Risk, and the Control
Problem
Summary
Fears about superintelligence can trace their history back to the early days of
computing but have been brought to the forefront in recent years by those concerned
with the prospect of existential risk. The questions of control and of value alignment
are writ large. Examining these questions requires looking at basic assumptions
about the nature of intelligence and the foundation of our values, including the
orthogonality thesis. We examine Stuart Russell’s proposals to try to ensure that any
superintelligence will follow human values and preferences.
10.4.1
Introduction
The fears about the possible development of superintelligence have a long history.
Not only do they feed into general fears about the control of machines and artefacts
such as robots by human beings that have concerned human beings for centuries (see
Sect. 2.5), starting in the mid-twentieth century, there have been speciﬁc warnings
about the potential for the development of AI that could spell doom for the human
race. We saw how Alan Turing warned in 1951 that thinking machines would be
able to exceed our powers and hence have the ability to control us [56]. Norbert
Wiener’s approach to the issue was perhaps more complex, seeing the importance of
the complex interactions between computers and humans [57]. Indeed, it is these
complex interactions and feedback loops between human and machine which bring a
bridge between the futuristic nightmare scenarios of control by a vastly superior

machine and the more mundane but nonetheless pressing and profound questions
facing us right now, as we shall see later in this chapter. Fears which more
speciﬁcally address the current superintelligence debates were sounded in 1966 by
I. J. Good, who had worked with Turing. Good suggested that an ultraintelligent
machine, being deﬁned as exceeding all human intelligence, would be able to use its
intelligence
to
recursively
improve
itself
resulting
in
an
‘intelligence
explosion’ [58].
10.4
Superintelligence, Existential Risk, and the Control Problem
435
Existential risk However prescient and apt these warnings might be, it is also
salutary to reﬂect on the mood of the times: in the wake of the scientiﬁc and technical
advances taking place in the Second World War and the Cold War, fears of nuclear
Armageddon were very real. Fears that computing might also lead to human
catastrophe parallel nuclear fears. Indeed, concern about the dangers of how we
might protect ourselves from the development of superintelligence forms a major
focus of research for those concerned with existential risks to humanity, such as the
Future of Life Institute, Stanford University’s Stanford Existential Risks Initiative
(SERI), the Future of Humanity Institute at the University of Oxford, and, it will
surprise no one to discover, at the Centre for the Study of Existential Risk at the
University of Cambridge. The existential risk of superintelligence may be framed as
human extinction, but it could also be a scenario where humans live appalling lives
at the mercy of something they created but cannot control.
Nick Bostrom’s account of the issues in his 2014 book Superintelligence: Paths,
Dangers, Strategies has received considerable attention [59]. He projects that, at its
best, AI may lead to the fulﬁlment of humanity’s endowment, enabling us to gain the
best from our natures and the world, but fears that there may be a ‘hard take-off’
where over a very short time, perhaps a matter of days or hours, an advanced
artiﬁcial intelligence could recursively self-improve until it reached at state of
intelligence so far above the best human capacity that we would be unable to control
it, or indeed, to understand it at all well, in an AI takeover scenario. We would have
reached the singularity.
Stuart Russell’s book Human Compatible also addresses superintelligence, set-
ting out to improve upon Bostrom’s work [60]. Like Bostrom, he sees contrasting
possibilities for AI: a golden age or catastrophe. He posits a possible ‘gorilla
problem’: that, just as humans regard gorillas as of less value to humans, despite
their considerable intelligence, so superintelligence might come to regard us.
Much of the debate about superintelligence concerns the assessment of the
possibility, both practically and conceptually, of a superintelligent AI, including
questions about what this might even mean. The issue then essentially concerns how
AI is understood, as well as how intelligence is understood. For instance, it has been
argued that intelligence has many dimensions and that the idea of a single notion of
‘greater intelligence’ is misleading [61]. There are different assessments of the
chances of this happening and the speed at which it might happen. Andrew Ng
famously claimed that the problem was so remote that worrying about it was like
worrying about the overpopulation of Mars [62]. The One Hundred Year Study on
Artiﬁcial Intelligence at Stanford issued a report stated that superintelligence was not

near and not likely to occur [63]. But what are the costs if these opinions are
incorrect?
436
10
Towards the Future with AI: Work and Superintelligence
The urgency of the problem is emphasised by Bostrom and by Russell: a
superintelligence take-off that then developed such that we were unable to under-
stand or control it would be the most signiﬁcant thing that could happen to humanity.
Bostrom argues that we have only one chance to get it right. With this in mind, he
argues against those who consider the development of superintelligence and the
accompanying scenarios of existential doom unlikely, by calculating that even if
there was a minute chance of existential catastrophe, this would be such a loss of
value in the world that it would justify spending money now to attempt to forestall
this, even if the chances of success in preventing catastrophe were small [64, p. 18].
Given the relatively low resources and salaries being put into such research coun-
tering existential risks, compared to the money poured into technology in general,
Bostrom’s argument may hold up, but we will consider further below the underlying
premise of his position when we address Longtermism [1], as well as addressing the
present value of examining the arguments advanced towards mitigating the dangers
of superintelligence.
The problem is one of value alignment on a massive scale, a scale which in
many ways makes a difference not just of degree, but of kind. The attempt to ensure
that speciﬁc applications of AI are aligned with our goals and values often runs into
control problems: for example, if there is a lack of transparency, or if undetected bias
within a system of algorithms reproduces or even worsens certain kinds of bias that
are counter to general societal values, or if there are run-on effects within a system,
for example, changes to people’s behaviour as a result of increased data collection
and surveillance.
If a discrete application of AI is found to be misaligned with our values, we have
some hope of detecting it and remedying the situation (with the proviso that we still
have to deal with the enduring and difﬁcult issues of transparency and control).
Moreover, AI itself can often help us to detect whether a system is misaligned with
our values. Just as algorithms may reproduce and worsen bias, they can also be used
to detect it. For example, because of the incomplete nature of medical knowledge
and the history of data collection and medical research, bias in research is very
possible and may both be reproduced in research involving machine learning, but the
very same techniques can be used to spot, analyse, and combat such disparities
[65]. Medical practitioners may be unaware that certain diagnostics and treatments
deliver worse results to certain groups or may not understand why certain disparities
in outcome exist, but data analysis using AI may help to reveal this [66].
The control problem gets critical However, superintelligence is feared since our
capacity to control it will be greatly diminished, owing to its superior intelligence.
The control examples above merely referred to particular instances of machine
learning, which as we have seen, many practitioners are reluctant even to call
‘artiﬁcial intelligence’ because its capacities are for merely discrete and limited
aspects of intelligence. Moreover, the fears are worsened by the imagined scenarios
where superintelligence can be in charge of any and of every aspect of our lives and

rendered more frightening still by Bostrom’s scenario of a rapid take-off where
artiﬁcial intelligence could recursively self-improve. No wonder his book has been a
best seller.
10.4
Superintelligence, Existential Risk, and the Control Problem
437
The very nature of the intelligence within artiﬁcial intelligence must therefore
now be examined The fear that superintelligence may be misaligned with our
values raises the question of the relationship between intelligence and the ability
to understand value and the motivation to pursue things of value. Since we are
dealing with projected scenarios, this means examining not simply the ‘intelligence’
within artiﬁcial intelligence as it is currently being developed but ideologies and
views on the very nature of intelligence.
10.4.2
How Might Superintelligence Come About?
Bostrom’s book contains a wealth of detail but let us give an outline of his argument
about the dangers of superintelligence. A starting point is the problem of perverse
instantiation (see Sect. 2.3). This problem in itself is the general problem of giving
instructions in ways that admit of no misunderstanding, worsened by the degree of
autonomy within a system. In perverse instantiation, one’s wishes are carried out to
the letter in ways that are self-defeating or uncontrolled. King Midas wished for
everything he touched to turn to gold, only to ﬁnd this happened even to things he
loved such as his daughter. Goethe’s poem The Sorcerer’s Apprentice (and the
Disney ﬁlm) tells a tale of a novice magician attempting to sweep up, using a magic
broom he ﬁnds he cannot control, resulting in increasing chaos [67, 68].
Although this is bad enough, superintelligence would far more powerful than a
broom, and could hack attempts to control it. Superintelligence may be motivated to
defeat any attempts to control it if it determines that this strategy is needed to fulﬁl
the goals with which it has been programmed. For example, Bostrom argues that
were we to try to control artiﬁcial intelligence by containing it in a box, any
superintelligence would be able to work how to bust out in order to fulﬁl goals
that it has been given. This ability would be heightened by its capacity to understand
the motivations and limitations of humans and to understand and anticipate the likely
efforts we might make to control it.
Worse, superintelligence may be motivated to continue with a task beyond what
any human might have envisaged if it is motivated to optimise and to ensure that it
has adequately completed its goals. The superintelligence would have instrumental
goals towards producing paperclips, such as providing materials for this and over-
riding any competing activities. (The assumption is that, being superintelligent, it is
able to marshal physical resources to great effect, dominating any attempts to combat
it.) We, mere humans, could be seen as resource material for paperclips (despite the
extremely small amount of suitable elements in our bodies: every little helps). We
may have created an intelligence that views us simply as raw material, as objects.

438
10
Towards the Future with AI: Work and Superintelligence
The example of creating paperclips may be useful in selecting a subject that is
neutral and thus less likely to produce emotional reactions one way or the other. It is
also striking how Bostrom illustrates his concerns with the paperclip, an item more
useful in an ofﬁce setting highly dependent on older technologies and on, or course,
paper (although paperclips are known to be used in the main for other functions).
The superintelligence is a monster: literally gobbling us up, as if we are mere ﬂesh
and bones, worse, for even the layer of complexity and value of our biology is
erased; using us up as if our very ﬂesh was nothing but chemicals, was merely
matter. We don’t even have the relative dignity of having our minds hacked. We are
in a nightmare scenario of reversed reciprocity.
The orthogonality thesis The root source of the problem is that intelligence, as
manifest within artiﬁcial intelligence and as envisaged in superintelligence, is
understood as orthogonal to value: the level of intelligence bears no connection to
the ability to understand value [69]. Any values exhibited by artiﬁcial intelligence,
and hence superintelligence, are placed there in the goals with which it is set up by
us. As superintelligence develops its powers, it will develop various instrumental
goals as necessary to assist with fulﬁlling the goals that we placed there. We have
mentioned this earlier (see Sect. 2.3) and how such a claim relates to long-standing
philosophical debates not only about the nature of intelligence and of wisdom, not
only about the nature of knowledge, but also about the very foundations of ethics and
of moral epistemology.
The world as devoid of value and purpose Indeed, the view that our knowledge of
the world is devoid of value, telling us nothing about how to act, only giving us
information which we might use instrumentally to achieve our goals, is commonly
held and commonly assumed to be beyond critique. Moreover, it goes along with
claims that to attain such knowledge, we must strip ourselves of bias, of emotion,
and must strive to observe the world from as universal a stance as possible, such that
any other unbiased observer would ﬁnd the same result. David Hume is often cited as
an originator of claims that there is a sharp and unbridgeable gulf between fact and
value (see Sect. 5.4.7), and many contemporaries follow broadly in his footsteps.
Stuart Russell, whose instrumental deﬁnition of intelligence we examined earlier
(see Sect. 5.2.1), agrees and speciﬁcally states in his work on the dangers of
superintelligence that there can be no purposes embedded within the world
[60]. We will see later, in Chap. 11, that there are other popular works that envisage
our future with artiﬁcial intelligence that take diametrically opposed views.
As we have seen, not all agree with such a view, especially in ethics (see Chap. 6,
especially Sect. 6.4). It may be argued that any intelligence that was devoid of
appreciation of the value which is embedded in the universe would simply not be a
complete intelligence. For example, as we saw, Plato considered that abstract
knowledge of the Forms would give us knowledge of the Form of the Good,
which would in and of itself be sufﬁcient to motivate us to act [70]. More contem-
porary moral realists also argue that value exists in the world and can be perceived in
certain ways [71].

10.4
Superintelligence, Existential Risk, and the Control Problem
439
However, the problem may still remain, unless we can somehow guarantee that
any potential superintelligence explosion or rapid take-off would result in the kind of
intelligence that was capable of seeing value in the world. (We would also have to
cross our ﬁngers and hope that the values of the universe were the same as ours—or
that we could readily realise that we were wrong about our values in certain ways.
Maybe humans are a blight on the cosmos, after all.) Understanding the necessary
links of the superintelligence problem with issues concerning not simply the nature
of intelligence but questions of epistemology in general, and in moral epistemology
in particular, can help us to understand the nature of the questions with which we are
grappling, as well as how the particular ways in which the superintelligence problem
is formulated and approached help to reveal deep-seated and in many ways conten-
tious positions regarding the nature of artiﬁcial intelligence in addition to some
foundational philosophical debates. We need to consider questions of moral episte-
mology not simply in relation to superintelligence but in relation to us, human
beings.
Bias in Algorithms and a Humean Account of Ethics
Consider this: suppose intelligence is orthogonal to value, and suppose fact
and value are completely separate things, such that in order to see the world
accurately and completely, we have to rid ourselves of bias in the form of
emotion. Any moral view we have merely based upon sentiment, feeling, or
emotion.
What implications might this have for how we understand the bias problem
in AI?
We are driven to prevent bias by our values, which are based upon feeling.
The removal of bias requires us to remove any inﬂuence of feeling or
emotion upon how we observe, measure, and analyse the world.
At what stage do we reintroduce feelings in order to assess whether or not a
situation or an algorithm is biased in ways that are counter to our values?
Measuring any bias towards an individual involves assigning that individ-
ual to certain categories. Is this assignment based simply upon observation of
the world, or are we imposing any values upon the world as we look for bias?
Is the way in which we divide the world into categories which we deem
relevant to questions of justice, fairness, and bias, given by the world, or given
by our values?
Might overcoming bias in algorithms merely be a co-ordination problem of
trying to accommodate the multiple biases of billions of different people? And
if so, what determines the values upon which this is based?

Attempting to Find a Solution: Ensure
Superintelligence Aligns with Human Values
Bostrom
proposes
two
possible
pathways
for
addressing
the
dangers
of
superintelligence: ﬁnding some way of boxing in and containing its power and
providing incentives such that it would not develop in ways that greatly threatened
us. There is great complexity to his positions, which have naturally received
considerable attention and critique [72–74]. Here, however, we focus on Stuart
Russell’s attempted strategy to address the issues, one that makes use of many of
the ethical concepts and theory we have met in this book and that draws upon the
account of intelligence that he proposes, as we saw in Chap. 5.
Human Compatible: assumptions and goals Stuart Russell’s assumptions in his
presentation of the problems and suggested solutions closely overlap with those of
Bostrom. He considers intelligence to be orthogonal to value, with any value
instrumental and measured by the goals that it uses its intelligence to reach and
with its capacity to reach its objectives measured by a utility function. Hence, values
are sharply divided from facts: there is no value in the world, no purposes in the
world. Value and purposes all derive from human beings. There is a complication
here, in that animals also pursue their own purposes, and there may be life elsewhere
in the universe which also does this, but let’s leave aside these details for now, as we
have enough complexity to be getting on with, and until the aliens arrive, we can
bracket their concerns for now (although, see later).
However, Russell does make certain generalisations about human motivations:
that we care in general about what happens in the future, and we care about each
other. We know that this assumption is false in certain cases, as otherwise the sin of
acedia, a listlessness and lack of concern for anything or involvement in the world,
would never have been a problem. We can see these as assumptions about human
nature and will return to them below.
Russell also fears perverse instantiation of our goals, and his general approach is
to ensure that however artiﬁcial intelligence develops, and how powerful it becomes,
it will always be compatible with human values, which, given that he considers
humans the only (or at least the main) source of value, seems a reasonable aim.
Hence, the objectives we put into artiﬁcial intelligence must be such that they
reliably track our true values. His aim is somewhat modest: we must aim to ensure
that superintelligence will never make us seriously unhappy [60, p. 171]. (Although
given that artiﬁcial intelligence already makes many people seriously unhappy, this
aim is perhaps not so modest.)
Deference to human values We thus need a reliable way of ensuring, and
checking, that any artiﬁcial intelligence which might lead to the development of a
superintelligence has objectives aligned not too far away from ours. We have seen
plentiful reasons to worry that the way we specify our objectives and place them into
machines may inadvertently lead to great misalignment with our own values; we

have plenty of reason to doubt that we ourselves have a complete grasp on our own
values. Russell’s suggestion involves including probabilities and uncertainties in
artiﬁcial intelligence. AI would be designed so that it would repeatedly check
whether it was in alignment with our values. Moreover, it would not necessarily
take us at our word what our values were: it would infer them from multiple sources
and modify its picture of our values over time.
10.4
Superintelligence, Existential Risk, and the Control Problem
441
In this way, AI has only one objective, to maximise utility understood as fulﬁlling
human goals, in turn understood as human preferences. Uncertainty is built in so that
the AI never ploughs on with disastrous consequences: it needs to constantly check
with human beings because, and since there is no other source of value in the world,
the only reliable source of information about human preferences will be how humans
behave (including their use of language) [60, p. 173].
AI must understand us, but how? Russell notes that machines are rather different
from humans, and their understanding of the human mind is poor [60, p. 123]. They
do not share a human mind and hence cannot engage in that reciprocity, which is at
best found between humans. So how will AI understand us and our values? Recall
our discussions of the many problems that the attempts to understand humans via
data collected using AI; see, e.g. Chap. 8 especially Sect. 8.7.3. It is fair to note that
Russell is envisaging ways of designing AI and not claiming that this is already
possible.
In a nutshell, AI will observe our behaviour, and reverse engineer the data to infer
our preferences from it.
Exercise 12
Before we continue, consider the difﬁculties for a human being of inferring prefer-
ences from someone’s behaviour (including language). Now consider the difﬁculties
of doing so for a machine and the nature of any differences. The material in Chap. 9
concerning online content moderation may be useful.
There are multiple challenges in this endeavour, as Russell naturally realises.
Some concern the capacity of machines (indeed, or anyone) to read the behaviour
and language of others. Some concern the difﬁculties of inferring values underlying
motivation. In addition, there are many remaining questions concerning ethics and
the realisation and implementation of value. Many of these will be familiar from our
study of utilitarianism in particular, since Russell assumes a consequentialist frame-
work of value. We will be able to see that many of the problems underlying current
efforts to ensure that our computers do not take over the world and use us as their
playthings or worse are precisely those problems that have been vexing philosophers
for centuries.
Observing human behaviour and interpreting language will be necessary The
machine must of necessity regard us as a roughly as a behaviourist might, armed
with some knowledge of the inner workings of human psychology as a help to
interpretation, and with understanding of language, regards us: from the outside.
There will be no ‘aha!’ moment of mutual recognition. There are many problems

with attempting to do this. Inferring intention from behaviour as we have seen (see
Sect. 4.4.5) is complex and requires context and nuance. So this will certainly be
difﬁcult.
442
10
Towards the Future with AI: Work and Superintelligence
Suppose, for example, aliens came to Earth and attempted to interpret the
activities of scientists and practices surrounding the scientiﬁc endeavour. Would
they come away with the conclusion that it was motivated by the pursuit of truth? Or
might they conclude that it was, say, a game for labelling the world and its
regularities with the names of certain individuals who managed to navigate their
way to key positions of prominence within institutions and was hence a way of
mapping human presence onto the world, with certain side effects such as sometimes
enabling certain men to attract females? Plank’s Constant, Maxwell’s Equations,
Schrödinger’s cat, the rigorous policing of citation practices, and so on, might lead
the aliens to such a conclusion.
Likewise, as we have seen, there are great challenges with interpreting language
(see Chap. 9). Russell indeed notes that artiﬁcial intelligence will need to have an
understanding of pragmatics. On the other hand, we are not looking for a perfect
solution, only one that is a ‘good enough’ with our preferences, and we are to assume
that the superintelligence is considerably more advanced than current natural lan-
guage processing capabilities.
However, even should the machine become reasonably adept at interpreting our
language, our behaviour, our intentions, and our feelings, there is still a problem with
inferring from all this information an understanding of preferences that might
reasonably amount to an account of values. We act under certain descriptions.
Consider, for instance, a personality test that asks you if you would rather go to
the library or to a party. I for one am stumped at such questions, because so much
depends upon circumstances, whose party, which library, and so on, but the point of
the exercise is to elicit general preferences for ‘library time’ or ‘party time’. How
strong is one’s leaning either way? And for how long would one have to be
observed? And would one have to observe the sighs, the times gazing out of the
window, to conclude that a person did not actually like the library all that much? Or
is the window-gazing a chance to gather thoughts, and the sighs an indication of how
deeply the person is thinking? It would be necessary to gather a mass of data about
all these things and any other possible preferences one might have. It would also be
necessary to understand if the behaviour of ‘walking into the library and staying
there for a time’ even counted as an act of ‘going to the library’ per se and hence
counted towards making one a library kind of person. Because it may be the main
motivation is that a romantic partner works there, that you like the human compan-
ionship of so many bodies around you all studying, and so on. So we see that the
very idea of whether a person even sees a venue as ‘a library’ is up for grabs in the
complexity of comprehending behaviour and values. Social scientists who conduct
both qualitative and quantitative work trying to understand people’s behaviour and
beliefs have been struggling with these issues for some time.
However, can we overcome these issues? Let us be optimistic that we can
certainly make sufﬁcient progress, but we might just be a little wary that the kind

of optimism about tackling such questions about what will satisfy human preferences
and make us happy, let alone about tackling some deep philosophical questions
about ethics, amounts to a kind of ethical solutionism, the insistence that ‘yes we
can’. Russell himself says that we need to consider understanding and achieving
happiness as a kind of engineering discipline [60, p. 123], noting that we need to
work together with a large range of different disciplines to achieve this.
10.4
Superintelligence, Existential Risk, and the Control Problem
443
Exercise 13
Drawing on whatever relevant knowledge you have, including earlier discussions
about the nature of happiness, how feasible do you consider it that we could develop
an ‘engineering discipline’ of happiness?
There is also an inherent difﬁculty with rendering happiness an engineering
discipline that is well understood by machines, especially if these are very powerful
machines. Because it would make happiness easier to hack. We return to this
question shortly after outlining some other difﬁculties.
Hierarchies of preferences It will be immediately apparent that there are hierar-
chies to our preferences. We have already considered these in our discussion of the
nature and value of persons in Chap. 8. (We will shortly consider the implications for
respect for persons and for prioritising the concerns of different individuals.) Hier-
archy of value does not occur simply because we rank value in degree of importance
(although this ranking may be rough and ready, circumstantial, and hard to deter-
mine) but also because we have preferences about our preferences (see the discus-
sion of Frankfurt in Sect. 8.6). For instance, suppose I am not keen on going to
parties, but wish I went to more of them, because it’s a good way to meet people and
it might help me overcome my lack of social skills. The assumption will be that the
preferences about preferences take priority. This might work well if humans had
well-ordered and neatly nested, consistent sets of preferences, but alas, this may not
be so. Consider Augustine’s prayer: ‘Oh Lord, give me chastity and continence, but
not yet’.
Augustine’s preferences for continence and chastity are meta-preferences: pref-
erences about preferences—he prefers that he has the ability to control his desires,
and in particular his sexual desires, so, they seem ‘higher’ and hence ‘better’ than his
ﬁrst-level preferences. However, his preference that he not gain continence and
chastity just yet, is a meta-meta-preference. Is this the best of all? Or does it
demonstrate the weakness of his meta-preferences? Or illustrate the internal battles
so typical of humanity?
This brings us to the next issue: irrationality.
Exercise 14
What, if anything, makes our preferences about our preferences ‘better’ kinds of
preferences? Consider the meta-preference: ‘I would prefer it if I did not worry so
much about the welfare of others and could just do what on earth I liked’. Consider
the passage from Dostoevksy’s Notes from Underground that we looked at in Sect.
6.2.4. Is the protagonist’s wish to act on his own ‘free and unfettered volition’ a

meta-preference, and if so, should any superintelligence attempt to act in accordance
with this preference? Does rationality or its absence matter?
444
10
Towards the Future with AI: Work and Superintelligence
Recognising irrationality Russell recognises that the machines must be able to
recognise human irrationality. Human beings do not always act in accordance with
their best judgements and may form beliefs contrary to the best evidence available to
them. So we may act counter to what we most want to do. Of course, we may not
always do what we think we ought to do, but the problem is deeper than this: we may
not do what we want to do, all things considered, perhaps out of habit, perhaps out of
sheer wilfulness [75]. But how precisely do we understand rationality? This is
needed to interpret ‘true’ preferences. This yet again reveals a deep philosophical
question, one which it is necessary to answer if we are to infer preferences in others.
Some consider that such deep irrationality of motivation is not actually possible. So
that if we seem to act against our preferences, this will be an illusion or caused by
some error such as a false belief. Others disagree. An answer to this question may be
necessary to infer preferences simply from behaviour. We face a question about
human nature.
Exercise 15
Russell suggests that artiﬁcial intelligence might improve its understanding of
human preferences and motivation by reading novels. Take one or two novels
(or
movies)
with
which
you
are
familiar
and
consider
what
lessons
a
superintelligence might learn from them. This exercise is perhaps mostly for fun.
Hacking humans Irrationality is not our only problem. Our preferences can be
hacked. Indeed, the more that a superintelligence discovers about human happiness,
preference formation and satisfaction, and our reward systems, the more readily it
will be able to hack these [60, p. 208]. There are various reasons for the ease with
which human preferences can be hacked and why AI might be very good at this.
Preference and belief Preference satisfaction very frequently depends upon the
belief that a preference has been fulﬁlled: the possibilities of AI, deepfakes, and
virtual reality signiﬁcantly increase the possibility of being satisﬁed through being
fooled (although whether this is a trick or not depends upon one’s idea of ‘reality’).
Having a preference for the truth does not solve things; it only motivates the
superintelligence to make sure you never discover the truth, which could make
your imprisonment in a world of fakery even more entrenched.
Preference formation Recall that Russell considers that there is no purpose in the
world. Hence, this seems to mean that there is no standard of value by which we rate
what preferences we might start out with or which preferences we lose. Any
preference will do. There is no human nature by which to assess their suitability,
other than the necessities given by the need for our biological survival (and the
superintelligence is meant to be loyal to us as humans, hopefully ﬁxing this.) This
seems to mean that so long as we are still getting something out of life, AI could
manipulate us to change preferences to ones that are easier to satisfy. This speaks to a

fundamental problem of any system of ethics based upon desires or preferences: they
can be fulﬁlled either by satisfying them or by taking away the preference.
10.4
Superintelligence, Existential Risk, and the Control Problem
445
Exercise 16
If a superintelligence changed your preferences to ones that were readily satisﬁed, in
what ways, if any, might this be wrong? Consider that humans often have vastly
unrealistic expectations in life, which can make them very unhappy.
Distributing happiness: the utility monster and other stories A thought exper-
iment by Robert Nozick proposes a ﬂaw with utilitarianism, and again, one that
would only be worsened and made more likely with the development of powerful
artiﬁcial intelligence [76, p. 41]. A person who gained an enormous degree of reward
from having preferences satisﬁed would win out over those who gained less from
having their preferences satisﬁed. This would skew the distribution of value over the
population. Although a thought experiment, this translates readily into everyday life:
think of a group sharing a house, for instance. There are often certain people who
mildly go along with the dominant wishes of those who make the most fuss.
Russell assumes that humans care about each other. This is tenet about human
nature which could readily be changed, especially with AI, which has the capacity to
manipulate our preferences. In any case, the capacity for care for others operates
weakly and inconsistently between individuals and is present to different degrees in
different individuals. The unevenness of distribution of preference satisfaction in the
world is only likely to be worsened if we take higher order preferences into account,
for those individuals who have a higher order preference to think more of others,
would lose out to those who have no such higher order preference. Ordinarily, we
would think of this as a way of ensuring that some kind of perverse reverse-ethical
world comes into being. Can you think of methods of combatting this?
The assumption that human beings care about what happens in the future and care
about each other forms part of Russell’s background picture of the nature of the
world, which seems essential to an attempt to ensure that by following human
preferences, superintelligence does not end up acting totally counter to our values.
However, this presupposes some universal or aggregated point of view from which
we are attempting to solve this problem: because the unevenness of distribution of
value over a population is only a problem, if we have some view such as that persons
ought to be equally valued or respected. See Sect. 6.2.5 for a discussion of the agent
neutrality of utilitarianism.
There is also the problem of how each one of us might be motivated. John Stuart
Mill grappled with this problem in Chap. 4 of Utilitarianism: ﬁnding good argu-
ments to move from ‘each person desires his or her own happiness’ to ‘each person
therefore, desires the happiness of the whole’ is extremely hard [77]. It may be in this
that we are simply up against the very difﬁcult questions which vex any account of
ethics, and that no other account would do better. What might help to address the
problems we have been discussing?

446
10
Towards the Future with AI: Work and Superintelligence
Exercise 17
And let us mention the position of animals. There are a great many more of them
than there are of human beings. The preferences people have regarding the treatment
of animals vary greatly. Moreover, the centring of humans in ethics is not universal
[78]. Why should we assume that we should ensure that superintelligence prioritises
the preferences of humans? (Below, we will consider a view that discusses the value
of ‘sentient beings’.)
Our future selves Common observation notes that our preferences and values
change over time. We would need to allow that the superintelligence could take
this into account. However, the situation is complicated by similar issues to those
discussed above in hierarchy of value and in the hacking of preferences, and again,
the debates between different philosophical notions of happiness are relevant. Mere
change in values over time may represent a decline, a narrowing of envisaged
possibilities as a person comes to accept their lot in life, or perhaps, somewhat
differently, as their character degenerates and corrupts. Alternatively, it may repre-
sent a ﬂowering of wisdom and phronesis.
The advantages and disadvantages of using a consequentialist approach The
focus on utilitarianism and preference satisfaction enables a certain simplicity of
approach and an approach that ﬁts quite neatly into an instrumental account of
intelligence as utility maximiser. However, we have also seen how it leads us straight
into issues that raise profoundly difﬁcult questions about the nature of value, of its
distribution, and of the value of persons. Perhaps, by including a standard of the
value of truth, a way of valuing persons and their projects, and a way of attributing
purpose and value to goals over a lifetime, we may in this way address some of the
weaknesses of consequentialism.
Consequentialism seems an ideal normative ethical theory to use when we are
looking to the near and distant future: it’s all about future possibilities. But it says
less, if anything, about how we get there, and moreover, we also need to address the
issue of who gets there: the agents and bearers of moral value, an issue with which
standard consequentialist approaches struggle. Perhaps the approach that moral
value belongs to individually identiﬁed bearers of value such as persons is wrong.
Maybe we should be looking just to maximise value across the universe as a whole
and stop worrying so much about our own little species.
How much can we achieve in ethics? We have considered multiple difﬁculties
with attempts to address the dangers we might perhaps face from superintelligence.
To reﬂect: in any area, we can only ﬁnd as much certainty as the subject matter
allows, which is a useful observation by Aristotle that is worth repeating [79]. This is
also worth noting if we are trying to avoid inadvertently seeing ethical issues through
the lens of technology and hence incorporating unrealistic or inappropriate goals.
One thing we have learned, however, is the necessity of philosophy. There are
considerable complexities to the minutiae of the arguments that Russell and others
advance in attempting to reduce the chances that we will come to a sorry end
courtesy of artiﬁcial intelligence. Many of these complexities are technical, but it

is valuable to understand how many of these arguments about the nature and
distribution of value are preﬁgured in philosophical debates.

Longtermism in AI

10.4.4
How Do Debates About Superintelligence Relate
to Current Issues in AI Ethics?
Is superintelligence simply a niche issue that merely sells books and engages those
who enjoy the thrill of minute discussion of the remote possibility of catastrophe?
One could argue that the very way in which the concerns about superintelligence are
framed closely mirrors the current concerns about AI. Issues arise from the ubiquity
of control; the capacities of superintelligence to mould and manipulate our beliefs
and preferences and change our behaviour; and ways in which a system governed by
superintelligence may hack distribution of values such that these become extremely
uneven.
The issue of control may also be manifest in similar ways to the worries that
attempts to lock our values into superintelligence may freeze our futures in prob-
lematic ways. Does this mirror the ways in which currently, the values of dominant
groups in creating and deploying technology, and the values of dominant groups in
considering the ethics of AI, may lock in certain values and certain ways of treating
human beings? Consider whether the inﬂuence of technology on ways in which we
gain information, communicate, and relate to ourselves and others, and the ways in
which infrastructure may become locked in and then presumed to be essential, may
or may not mirror the concerns of the extent of control that a superintelligence may
have over us. Concerns about projecting our current ethics into the future, both the
impetus to do this and the fear that there may be limits to this strategy, map onto the
impetus to ensure that globally applicable standards of ethics are produced and
applied, which also go along with legitimate fears.
Exercise 18
Argue for or against the proposition that these and other issues of control are
currently facing us, and if so, how.
Consider as many different facets of control, including the human capacity to
resist this, as possible.
10.5
Longtermism in AI
Summary
Longtermism, understood as the thesis that in deciding issues of resource allocation,
we ought to concentrate on the far distant future, raises interesting issues about the
relationship between the development of technology and ethics. We examine its
ethical and philosophical basis.

448
10
Towards the Future with AI: Work and Superintelligence
The future versus us We have looked at the question of prioritising work on far
future possibilities, such as the dangers of a superintelligence explosion, over current
and nearer and more tangible concerns. The divisions in approach here may seem
manageable, given the relatively few resources being applied to research into
superintelligence and the potential insights that such research might bring for how
we consider more tangible and current uses and abuses of AI. We have seen too, the
question of how we might ensure that how AI develops in the future reﬂects human
values now, and the perplexing conundrums that this brings about the soundness of
our current values, the concept of continued personal identity, and the prospect for
future
developments
both
individual
and
as
a
species.
Concerns
about
superintelligence tend to focus upon protecting current human values. Concerns
about whether too much attention is spent on fears about superintelligence also focus
upon concern for current human difﬁculties.
What if our whole current take on approaching ethical issues was misguided? Let us
consider the thesis of longtermism. This view can be helpful to illustrate some deep
divisions in approaches to asking and addressing questions in ethics, especially
when considering large-scale questions. It might also lead some of us to wonder,
have we been doing ethics completely wrong? In research papers published by the
Global Priorities Institute at Oxford University, forms of longtermism have been
defended focusing on how a society should spend resources as well as the major life
choices of individuals, such as career choice [1]. It is an approach which seems
extremely implausible and counterintuitive to many, but which with a few basic
premises presents calculations which, if accepted, would radically alter society’s
resource allocation. In particular, the authors argue that priority should be given to
efforts to prevent the existential risk of humanity dying out and to positively shaping
the development of artiﬁcial superintelligence. There are many technical aspects to
these arguments as well as critiques [80, 81].
Two forms of longtermism are defended: Axiological Strong Longtermism
(ASL), which holds that for agents making important decisions, every near-best
option is the one that is near-best for the far future and by a considerable margin over
concern for the near future. (‘Near-best’ allows for a degree of uncertainty about
outcomes and assessments.) Deontic Strong Longtermism (DSL) concerns what one
ought to do, which is to choose options that produce much larger beneﬁts in the far
future than in the near future.
It is assumed that in the future, there will be a vast number of expected lives of
sentient beings. Figures mentioned project that there will be a further 1014 human
beings born until the earth is no longer inhabitable (although the reader may have
spotted that evolution may have got in the way and our descendants far into the
future may no longer be recognised as homo sapiens; the focus is on sentient beings),
and potentially 1024 if humans manage to spread out into space. A second assump-
tion is that we can effectively act in ways that will predictably improve the far future,
for example, backing research into ways to prevent an extinction-level asteroid from
crashing into Earth.

10.5
Longtermism in AI
449
The basic reasoning behind this is mathematical. The argument is consequential-
ist and additive in form. From these premises, it is concluded that we can produce far
more value in the world in total if we focus on ensuring that the far future goes well
with as many sentient beings in the universe as possible. Indeed, it is argued that the
difference is so vast that even if we have a small probability of success, if we could
make an incremental impact on the number of sentient beings and the value in the
world, this is the best option. This does not mean we should neglect current issues
entirely; ordinary people can live their lives fairly normally, but in terms of resource
allocation, this might make a major difference. For example, one might decide to
focus upon preventing population-level threats to fertility and threats from
extinction-level pandemics but put less effort into treating rare genetic diseases.
One might focus on averting nuclear catastrophe, and this could have a major impact
on foreign policy, and so on.
Exercise 19
Consider some of the instances of the use of AI that we have considered or any
particular examples that you wish. How might ethical assessment of the issues shift if
the main focus was on the far future, with an emphasis on long-term survival of the
human race/sentient beings?
The very possibility of powerful technologies may profoundly shape and
change moral priorities and even how we approach ethical theories. Readers will
have noted that the contrast with other approaches to ethics is very pronounced. The
arguments essentially require the capacity to have some chance of positively
impacting the future, which means sophisticated and powerful technologies, includ-
ing artiﬁcial intelligence. Without these, the projected calculations simply would not
work. Hence, this argument may demonstrate a profound way in which the very
possibility of technology—including technologies not yet developed and about
which there is considerable concern—impacts ethics, rather than vice versa. Does
focusing on the future possibilities of technology awaken us to these values, or does
it distort our value system?
Much could be said and readers will doubtless by now have considerable capacity
to ask appropriate questions and provide critical assessment, positive or negative.
Let us end this chapter by raising a few salient issues.
Sentient beings: there is no assumption that the future beings that are the putative
objects of our moral concern are human; they are ‘sentient beings’. There is also
an assumption that the more sentient beings there are, the more value there will be
in the world. However, mere sentience is a fairly low bar. Note that it also
assumes clear differentiation between such beings, which is essential for to be
able to count them.
The location of value: recall our discussion of the agent neutrality of consequen-
tialism and the questions around the value of persons and the distribution of
happiness or welfare that it raised. Do we value beings per se, in and of
themselves, or only insofar as they are containers of value?

A maximising assumption is present that our duties now are to maximise value,
450
10
Towards the Future with AI: Work and Superintelligence
wherever and whenever it exists, rather than to any immediate or personal
commitment. A maximising assumption may look obvious until one considers
the costs of implementing it, when the question becomes more nuanced.
Moral imagination or maths: there are assumptions about moral epistemology and
how we form the basis for our moral decisions. The focus upon societal resource
allocation might be seen to justify this, since there could be scope for more
personal interactions and judgements in the remainder of life. What would it be
like to live a life intentionally ignoring the moral demands and pleas of one’s
fellows in favour of 1024 ‘sentient beings’? (Who can even imagine 1024?)
In the next chapter, we will explore further ideas about the future trajectory of the
world and of artiﬁcial intelligence. This will expose some similarities and some
marked differences in theoretical assumptions and ethical questions. Before you read
on, you may ﬁnd it useful to consider the points above and review material from
earlier in the book which might help to.
Exercise 20
Consider the key elements found in codes of ethics for AI as discussed in Chap. 2:
freedom and autonomy, transparency and explanation, justice and fairness, beneﬁ-
cence and nonmaleﬁcence, responsibility, privacy, sustainability, dignity, and
solidarity.
10.6
Key Points
The question of control in AI concerns both how we may control AI and how AI may
control us. The control question appears in many guises when considering the ethics
of AI. We have seen here its relation to formal properties of AI as well as in minute
details of context.
Examining the control questions in one context may shed some light upon the
control problem in other contexts, even if these at ﬁrst sight appear rather different.
Assessing the beneﬁts of using AI in any situation will require a close comparison
of human and machine agency and capabilities.
Placing AI into a complex system such as a workplace will require careful
analysis of the tasks involved. This will require not simply technical expertise or
superﬁcial understanding of what is required; it can be very advantageous to
consider different perspectives of those involved. In many contexts, subject matter
expertise and close research may also assist.
Many of the ethical questions of AI concern information and its ﬂow and raise
complex issues of surveillance and of the transparency with which AI and the system
within which it is nested operate.
Examination of questions in AI ethics impacting the future can reveal questions
about the very nature of AI, the foundations of ethics, and the boundaries of ethics
with questions of religion, spirituality, and meaning.

Attempting to address questions such as the problem of superintelligence is never
merely technical but involves choice, value, and supervenes on philosophical
questions.

Educator Notes
The material in this chapter will be consolidating the more theoretical material from
earlier in the book. Working through the topics and issues discussed here can be a
very good chance to test and expand students’ knowledge and understanding of
ethical theories and concepts. Although many of the exercises can be approached
from many different angles and may incite wide-ranging discussion, students should
be encouraged to ensure that they do also draw upon and refer to previous material.
Conversely, students should be encouraged to explore how questions in ethics and
philosophy may be relevant to dialogues with other disciplines on these topics.
Although this chapter is not primarily intended for use as stand-alone material,
there are plentiful references back to earlier material as relevant, and it may hence
still be useful for students who have not studied the earlier part of the course and
wish to examine cases of AI ethics in context.
Although here we concentrate on two issues, work and superintelligence, there
are many issues raised that generalise. For instance, the material looking at how to
analyse what task is being undertaken in the workplace can readily be generalised to
inform ways of analysing any use of AI, although the strategies raised are not
intended to act as a strict formula but rather as general guidance.
Many of the topics and exercises can be approached in very different ways,
especially as the topic of work intersects with so many questions in economic and
the social sciences, as well as raising issues around the value of creativity, and the
topic of superintelligence exposes clear foundational issues in computing and in
ethics. For instance, students in computing may wish to explore more technical
aspects of superintelligence and the nature of intelligence, those with backgrounds in
social science and humanities may wish to consider the questions that arise about
how we understand others and attribute preferences and values, and others may wish
to apply their knowledge of others and may wish to explore fears and dangers of
superintelligence through science ﬁction.
Debate topics and extended projects or essays Several of the exercises involve
complex questions that would form a good basis for class debate or group work
where students with different disciplinary backgrounds could each contribute dif-
ferent perspectives. Exercises that may produce useful classroom debates include
6, 7, 8, 10, 11, and 18. Some exercises would work well as the basis for detailed
essays or group projects requiring further research, including 2, 4, and 5.

Our Future with AI: Future Projections
and Moral Machines
Abstract This chapter continues our discussion of how we might live with
machines in the far future. Certain views of technological progress and of the future
of artiﬁcial intelligence discussed here rest upon an implicitly teleological view of
the universe. This provides points of contrast and comparison with the ethical
theories
and
conceptions
of
intelligence
underlying
the
responses
to
superintelligence examined in the last chapter. We then discuss views of human
nature, the foundations of ethics, and the nature and value of intelligence. These
discussions also raise the question of how humans and AI relate to each other, and
the second part of this chapter explores this topic directly, looking at our moral
obligations to machines, if any, and at whether human enhancement via machines
might be possible, focusing on the question of whether machines might be able to
enhance us morally. Addressing this question requires that we again pay attention to
different accounts of how ethical judgements and action are understood and again
make close comparison of human and machine agency. We especially highlight
issues in moral epistemology and capacities of intelligent machines to gather and
analyse knowledge, in comparison to humans, and in relation to the particular case of
moral judgements.

Introduction
We will start this chapter by exploring how AI may develop in the far future, taking
us beyond the control problem of superintelligence into visions of how the devel-
opment of AI might fulﬁl an unfolding purpose, and how we might develop
alongside AI, or how AI might develop in ways that leave us behind as a mere
passing phase of the universe. From fear of superintelligence to hopes for it, and
even to visions of glory. This discussion is a continuation of the last chapter,
showing some rather contrasting ways of looking at our future with AI; it also
links to the following sections of this chapter, where we ask a range of questions
about how humans and machines might relate to each other. This question is implicit

within discussions of the far future with AI, since we are forced to confront the
question of who we might become given certain scenarios regarding the nature of
technology and its control over us and the world. On some visions of the future with
technology, humans themselves may greatly change, or even cease to exist in any
recognisable form; not only is the question of the battle for control, the ‘us versus the
machine’ scenarios, and what attitudes we might have towards this, at issue.
Artiﬁcial intelligence may be visioned as a mere tool, something to fulﬁl our
wants and needs, or as some goal towards we wish to shape ourselves, a superior
version of us.

Our Future with AI: Future Projections and Moral Machines
The chapter then turns to look directly at questions about how we should relate to
AI, including but not limited to robots, and how AI might relate to us, possibly acting
to enhance us, to make us better people. In answering this, we will again be
expanding upon and consolidating material concerning ethical theory, questions of
human nature, and looking at what precise capabilities artiﬁcial intelligence might
have in comparison with the abilities of humans. We will have to consider the
question of what a moral question is and how suited artiﬁcial intelligence might be
for addressing questions of value. We will also have to consider whether what we
think of now as ‘ethics’ could feasibly assess some far future projected possibilities.
What Concepts and Tools Can We Bring to These Questions?
We will be looking again at some fundamental questions in ethics. This means we
will overview topics from across several previous chapters. We need to consider the
elements of moral agency and of what it is to be a moral patient, of which there are
different accounts. We will need to consider the fundamental basis of morality and
whether human beings, and even whether persons, are of ultimate value, or whether
something else is, and indeed, whether humans are the source of value. We will
consider the value of knowledge and of intelligence and whether there is any
meaning and purpose in the universe or whether it is inert and without inherent
value. This will involve careful comparison of humans with machines, including our
biological substrate and the nature of our boundaries and limits, and of human moral
weaknesses. We will also consider the concept of progress, both moral and techno-
logical. As we saw in the last chapter, many of these questions in ethics start to
merge with religious or spiritual attitudes towards the universe, its destiny, and our
destiny.
11.2
The Purposeful Universe: Value Beyond the Human
Summary
We examine Max Tegmark’s account of the possible development of AI and of the
universe as progressing with purpose towards an increasing awakening of awareness
and greater intelligence as life passes through different stages to develop the capacity
to redesign its own software and hardware. Tegmark proposes a growing value in the
universe that is conceived of in a way wider than simply ethical value but includes

aesthetic and epistemic elements and may differ considerably from many concep-
tions of ethics per se. In such an account, humans have a pivotal role in bringing
forth the future value of the universe.
11.2
The Purposeful Universe: Value Beyond the Human
459
We will examine aspects of Max Tegmark’s book Life 3.0 for an example of a vision
of the development of AI and the possible futures of the human race, a view that
incorporates a number of interesting value and metaphysical claims that provide
some illuminating contrast to other accounts, such as those of Bostrom and Russell
[1]. Tegmark is, in common with them, concerned about possible future disaster,
both natural and man-made, although, in his book, he also shares with readers some
wonderful and wild scenarios of a future universe teeming with possibility and value,
thanks to advancing technology. Opinions on these scenarios may differ wildly.
Of course many working in technology are motivated to use it to improve the
world for the better. (I do not include all working in technology in this bracket by any
means; some are clearly in it just for the money, some for nefarious means, some
haven’t given the matter much thought, and so on.) However, one might make
certain distinctions between the nature of the improvements that are foreseen.
Some are incremental and aimed at solving discrete problems, perhaps envisaging
a world more or less like this one, but without its major problems, or with problems
reduced. Recall our previous discussions concerning the different issues in AI: some
concern the minute technical details of how AI operates and the context in which it is
applied; some concern imaginative and ideologically infused ideas of how AI might
help us towards some vision of progress, whether disastrous or glorious. Recall how
artiﬁcial intelligence was envisaged as potentially able to end war, poverty, and
disease, and other clearly identiﬁed practical issues (see Sect. 5.2.5). This is small fry
compared to other narratives of the future that envisage radical change, including
radical change in who we are.
Numerous people describe and advocate such positions. We have already men-
tioned Donna Haraway’s Cyborg Manifesto [2]. Martine Rothblatt founded the
Terasem Movement, a group of organisations keen on the idea of achieving
human immortality by uploading human consciousness to a computer [3]. (One
hopes the computers in question are more robust than the average laptop, which has a
life expectancy of 3–5 years.) Ray Kurzweil, who has worked extensively in AI,
including in speech recognition, has written extensively on visions for the future,
which also include the idea that life extension can be achieved by uploading to a
computer, merging with a machine [4–6]. These views present me with the perennial
problem throughout this book: too much interesting stuff to include. So let us just
look at one account.
Tegmark presents various future possibilities in his book. Something which
makes it of interest to us is the manner in which it lays out a framework for the
value of, quite literally, the entire cosmos. The root source of value is the ‘awaken-
ing’ that occurs when parts of the universe become aware: the universe, or part of it,
becomes aware of itself. We human beings are part of the universe: we are aware of
(aspects of) our environment. This value is not explicitly ethical in form (notwith-
standing the difﬁculties in precisely deﬁning the domain of ethics); Tegmark speaks

of it as beauty and describes the capacity to reﬂect on the wonders that there are to
see in the universe but also talks of purpose, goals, and meaning. There is, as it were,
a two-tier aspect to the emerging value in the universe: its general capacity towards
greater complexity and the production of life with consciousness, goals, and pur-
poses, as well as the purposeful activity of that life itself in structuring and inﬂuenc-
ing the trajectory of the future. It is noteworthy that Tegmark expresses concern early
in the book about the calamitous possibility that the universe might lose this self-
awareness, which would render it meaningless [1, p. 23]. He also envisages that the
universe may ‘wake up’ more fully, perhaps like a dozy teenager being roused from
bed, or a bored suburban housewife from middle America who runs off to New York
City and from there to an ashram in the foothills of the Himalayas. Waking up more
fully may involve deepening levels of awareness and may be imagined as intelligent
life spreading out into the universe beyond our tiny planet and ﬂourishing for billions
of years.

11
Our Future with AI: Future Projections and Moral Machines
Intelligence is thus a critical aspect of this value but also self-reﬂection, the
capacity to contemplate, to appreciate beauty, to value knowledge, and a sense of
purpose and meaning are needed. The view here is perhaps akin to the views of
philosophers such as Plato and Aristotle (see Chaps. 5 and 6), who both valued the
life of the intellect and valued contemplation. In Aristotle’s work, we clearly saw a
teleological account of human purposes, and teleology embedded in the natural
world. One might perhaps see Tegmark as reading such views back into a model
of the construction of the universe derived from contemporary physics (he is a
cosmologist by background).
Tegmark explains his picture of this evolution of value in the world through
dividing life into three stages. Life 1.0 began simply with creatures such as bacteria,
complex creatures whose complexity can be maintained, and who can reproduce and
pass this complexity on. What is passed on is not the brute matter but the informa-
tion. The capabilities of Life 1.0 are simply the result of processes of evolution.
Bacteria do not themselves decide to multiply let alone decide to form an attractive
pattern in a Petri dish. Yet Life 2.0—us—has reached the cultural stage. Our
hardware is mostly the product of evolution (surgical bits and pieces excepted),
but culture and language have enabled us to design and plan what we do. This
enables great improvements in intelligence, enabling us to accelerate past the slow,
incremental, trial-and-error development of evolution. Not only can we learn in our
lifetimes, we learn from others, rely upon their knowledge and skills, and pass this
on to succeeding generations, but our biological hardware is seen as limiting life.
Life 3.0 will be life that has reached the technological stage. It can redesign not just
its own software but also its own hardware. This will enable rapid change. This
change will enable the creation of greater value in the form of intelligent, aware
entities and amounts to progress over Life 2.0. Since Life 3.0 will be able to replicate
itself rapidly and to improve, the expansion of value in the universe could be truly
immense. Note how value is counted: it is accumulative but also concerned with
complexity and with increasing the profundity with which it is manifest.

11.2
The Purposeful Universe: Value Beyond the Human
461
The good, the true, the beautiful The model is one of purpose and progress, but
this is not necessarily explicitly ‘ethical’. Note how value is intimately linked with
aesthetics, the appreciation of beauty, and with knowledge and understanding: the
inclusion of reﬂection and appreciation for the wonders of the universe means that it
is not simply raw data, or information, which is valued, nor is there a purely
instrumental account of the value of knowledge. We discussed how precisely to
categorise the boundaries of ethics earlier (see Sect. 1.10). In many modern ways of
understanding this, there is a tripartite division: what is good, what is beautiful, what
is true. Ethics deals with what is good; on many accounts, the prime or only focus is
on humans; the extension out to other entities emerges, broadly, from ﬁnding that the
foundations of ethical theory force this outward ‘expanding circle’ of concern (see
Sect. 4.3). Ethics also typically deals with questions of welfare or wellbeing, with
goals articulated around what is seen to lead to this for humans, such as allowing
autonomy and respecting preferences.
However, a broader conception of ‘the good’ has often been drawn. The connec-
tion of ethics and beauty, and the value given to conceptual and intellectual under-
standing, makes a link with the Greeks philosophers who saw contemplation as the
highest form of life and note also that Aristotle’s notion of the goal of what we call
‘ethics’ was a life lived well overall. The debate between Bentham and Mill on
higher and lower pleasures is also telling (see Sect. 2.5.2). Mill’s higher pleasures
require the capacity to appreciate art, culture, and knowledge; Bentham made no
such division. For that very reason, some dismiss Mill as an elitist, a snob, while
others consider it was Bentham who was simply blind to sources of value.
Biology and constraints It is obviously true that biology constrains. We can only
see a small part of the spectrum of light; we can only hold so many things in our
working memory at a time; few people over middle age can hear bats. The list of
constraints would be depressing if I continued further. The limits of our scientiﬁc
and factual understanding of the world are also apparent. Hopes of transcending this
abound in human thought: consider, for one example out of many, Plato’s Theory of
Forms and the idea that through contemplation philosophers could achieve under-
standing of how things truly are. We have also noted how on some accounts, value
may be found precisely within the limits of our biology, whether collectively or
individually (see Sects. 5.4.4 and 7.2.4). We touch on this topic again later, when
considering the potential for AI to assist us with moral decisions and to improve us
as moral agents. Indeed, the intricate connections between our embodied beings with
their particular biologies and our understandings of morality, various as they are, are
one of the very factors that make reﬂecting on and evaluating future prospects for
humanity that radically alter our biology and our biological relationships with each
other or even transcend our biology entirely, so complex and so fascinating. Let us
take a brief detour with an introduction to transhumanism.

462
11
Our Future with AI: Future Projections and Moral Machines
Transhumanism and Posthumanism
It is hard to give a precise deﬁnition of transhumanism since it encompasses a
wide variety of aims, philosophies, and methodologies, but it can broadly be
thought of as the loosely connected movement which aims to apply technol-
ogy to extend and enhance human lives in one way or another, but in ways
generally understood as exceeding the ‘ordinary’ aims of medicine, education,
or conventional social methods. Hence, for example, it does not merely aim to
prevent and cure life-limiting disease: it aims to extend the ‘natural’ human
lifespan, among other aims (which include the age-old quest for immortality).
Typical aims include greatly extending human intelligence, sensory percep-
tion, and behaviour. Proposals for how to achieve this include biological
methods such as using biotechnologies of various sorts to reverse or prevent
aging and improve cognitive functioning. Proposed methods may also include
nonbiological technologies, such as implants and other devices, which extend
sensory perception, strength, cognitive functioning, and memory, or indeed,
the prospect of replacing humans entirely with computing technologies. The
rise in transhumanism is thus associated with developments in science and
technology which enable such projected visions, including the more fanciful
suggestions, of which there are plenty. There are clear links with eugenics
movements.
Transhumanism generally conceives of a continuation of the human race
with radical improvements yet still biologically based, with an imagined
continuum between transhumanist futures and current human beings.
Posthumanism and its difference from transhumanism is also hard to deﬁne
precisely, but projects a future where humans will ‘escape’ their biology using
technology to become, or be succeeded by, posthumans who will no longer be
recognisably human, but will nonetheless be beings with worthwhile lives [7–
9].
Future lives, future values It is thus an essential aspect of transhumanism that it
aims to extend or surpass human nature. Many see no intrinsic value in ‘the natural’.
Yet, in asserting that proposals for change are indeed enhancements, some clear
notion of value must be applied. This implicitly values the natural and ﬁnds it
wanting, but in some instances, may actually project from what is found of value
in the natural and aim to increase this value; in this way, it may be grounded in some
appreciation of natural value. In proposing radical changes to human biology,
whether by the use of AI technologies or not, transhumanism could be said to treat
the human body as a form of Standing Reserve, as resource material to be moulded at
will, and hence to regard the body as a machine that we occupy rather than as
constitutive of what we are. There is obviously much that could be said about
transhumanism and posthumanism, with many varied and colourful proponents.

Those who have worked through (at least some of) the book should have plenty of
ideas and material from which to formulate questions and critical assessments.
11.2
The Purposeful Universe: Value Beyond the Human
463
Exercise 1
How would you begin to assess whether radical changes to human beings were
enhancements or simply changes?
If we accept the goals of transhumanism and/or posthumanism, do we have to
reject any ethical theories based upon ideas of nature, of function, or of purpose in
the world?
What might ground a claim that a transhumanist or posthumanist life was
worthwhile? On what basis might it be claimed that it was more worthwhile than
current human life?
Are there any essential elements of human beings that would have to remain in
order for a transhumanist or posthumanist life to be one of value?
What questions need to be asked about continuing personal identity and the
criteria by which we identify others and see ourselves as the same, despite changes?
In thinking about these questions, you may wish to revise material in Chaps. 3, 5,
and 8, as well as thinking in general about the ethical theories we have explored.
Now to return to Life 3.0.
Is there purpose in the universe? Tegmark’s book can easily be read as imposing
a teleological conception onto the universe, which many automatically reject,
regardless of the particularities of an account of purpose. Those rejecting any notion
of implicit purpose may make claims such as these: The universe around us should
be observed impartially, and we should attempt to understand it as it is seen, not
superimposing some ideology or agency on it. We simply see bacteria emerge, then
multicellular organisms, then creatures such as mammals, then primates, then
humans. The chronological order should not be confused with a progress in value.
Purpose only comes from us: we use things and design things for certain purposes.
That’s it. The universe is inert, it just happens.
One could reply that something akin to Tegmark’s conclusions simply follow
from his account of value: not merely that it implies that it is good to produce more
value but because awareness is key to value. Awareness can admit of complexity, yet
the current level of awareness we humans have is limited, as is our capacity to spread
value through the universe. Having identiﬁed value, it follows from the very account
of value that it would be better if the universe moved in certain directions. This is
tantamount to identifying something akin to purpose. Indeed, Tegmark talks both
about entities that have evolved towards, and which are designed for, a goal.
For comparison, a consequentialist who considered that happiness was a value
and that we ought to maximise the amount of happiness in the world would probably
have to hold that the best world was one that contained the maximum population
consistent with the maximum overall happiness. (How precisely to achieve this
indeed raises considerable problems for consequentialism which have been much
discussed. The ‘repugnant conclusion’, so named by Derek Parﬁt, concerns the
problem that if the possible universe with the greatest amount of value in it consisted

of one with a very large number of beings each with a barely adequate amount of
welfare, this is preferable to a universe of fewer beings who each have much higher
welfare, but where the overall value is even marginally lower [10, 11].) Hence, so
long as value has been identiﬁed correctly, and so long as the very idea of value
includes that the more value is realised in the world, the better, then we’re away.
464
11
Our Future with AI: Future Projections and Moral Machines
Exercise 2
When discussing consequentialism, we considered the broad issue of agent neutral-
ity and asked whether consequentialism might be putting the cart before the horse, in
seeing humans (or indeed any entity) as merely vessels or containers for the
realisation of value, rather than of value in and of themselves (see Sect. 6.2.5).
Consider how future projections of increasing value throughout the universe with the
aid of AI might look, if the aim was to increase value per se, or to increase the
number of valuable beings.
A role for humans Humans are the only form of life (that we know of) through
which technology has come into the universe, which may be capable of improving
itself to create self-aware and increasingly intelligent entities. Evolution has more or
less done its best. There could be some incremental improvements, but these will
never overcome the problems in information processing inherent to biology. More-
over, it may be that we ourselves never colonise space to any great extent: the range
of planets our biology would permit us to inhabit is extremely small, for one thing.
Nonetheless, we can act as the vehicles through which a greater intelligence could
populate the universe more widely, hence spreading greater, and more profound,
value.
Exercise 3
We are of limited intelligence. In particular, our intelligence is limited by our
biology, yet on Tegmark’s account, it is we humans who have identiﬁed the nature
of value in the world and who have a role in helping to realise this value. We seem to
have a dilemma, for might not the limits of our biology also limit and shape our
capacity to understand what the value in the universe truly is? Discuss.
There are many possible futures outlined in Tegmark’s book. Some are disas-
trous, on any account. Others are optimistic, on a truly monumental scale, with
artiﬁcial entities capable of great intelligence populating the cosmos. Tegmark even
produces a table indicating the amount of raw matter on Earth that has so far been
converted into goal-oriented entities, listed in billions of tons [1, p. 258]. The matter
in our built environment is added to the human total, which, given the 100 billion
tons of concrete and 20 billion of steel, puts us right up top in the animal league. It is
at such points that the ideas may start to seem fanciful, and one might wonder if
value has been correctly identiﬁed: if it actually requires converting as much brute
matter as possible into goal-directed vehicles for awareness and intelligence. How
could we assess this ethically? It perhaps seems clear that there are considerable
challenges to providing assessments from within many of our current systems.

11.3
Contrasting Frameworks Behind Visions of AI and Approaches to Ethics
465
Exercise 4
Plato’s idea that philosophers would be able to contemplate the Forms, giving
insight into eternal truths, is, on the one hand, attractive in many ways but, on the
other hand, hard to envisage, not least because we ordinary folk have scant idea of
what these Forms might truly be like. Consider a universe ﬁlled to the maximum
with aware, intelligent entities. If value in the universe lies in such awareness and
reﬂection on the wonders of the universe itself, what might ‘life’ be like in such a
vision, taken to extremes? We are in the area of speculation here. This might provoke
some interesting thoughts and conversations about value.
Why does this matter? Is this not one man’s pet vision? First, it has been a very
popular account. Second, as we shall see, it indicates elements of a strong strain of
idealistic thought, variably expressed around a discernibly common theme, of
progress, the value of intelligence, a world of purpose and meaning, perhaps a
yearning that the enterprise of technology is not so far from the enterprise of culture
and that we aim for more than simply a better version of our smartphone, an app for
this, that, and the other, but we reach for the stars, in whatever way that might
manifest itself. It may represent a rebellion against a mundane and merely instru-
mental idea of intelligence and a prosaic view of the projects of artiﬁcial intelligence.
11.3
Contrasting Frameworks Behind Visions of AI
and Approaches to Ethics
Summary
We compare and contrast the underlying claims and assumptions behind the differ-
ent approaches to our future with AI of Russell and Tegmark: if there is any purpose
embedded in the world, whether human beings, as they are now, form the grounding
basis of value; and whether the central value of concern is explicitly ethical or
something broader. Both give some kind of central role to human beings. Their
contrasting visions can both be seen as arising from Western traditions of value and
hence give rise to the question of how other cultural and value traditions may address
such issues.
Stuart Russell and Max Tegmark both have large academic and public proﬁles in
AI. Tegmark is a physicist and cosmologist and heads the Future of Life Institute,
which concerns itself with existential risks, including from AI; Russell is on the
scientiﬁc advisory board. They both work in the USA and indeed have produced
joint work in AI ethics [12]. They thus could be seen to represent inﬂuential and
dominant thinking in this area. Yet analysis of their views reveals some deep ﬁssures
and fundamental disagreements of approach. This disagreement is actually rather
useful for us, since it demonstrates neatly the need to examine foundational issues
regarding the source of value, the nature and value of humanity, and our place in the
world.

466
11
Our Future with AI: Future Projections and Moral Machines
As we saw in the last chapter, Stuart Russell considers that there is no purpose in
the world, that we focus on humans as bearers of value, and indeed, they are also the
source of value in the form of their (ordered, ‘rational’) preferences. They are
implicitly the only source of value, since although they may choose to include
animals as bearers of value, animals do not get to make such choices. This view of
the value of humans also extends far into the future, given Russell’s concern for how
we might cope long term with the development of superintelligence. There is scant if
any sense that now might be time for the superintelligence to take turns at being
top dog.
In stark contrast, Tegmark presents a vision that does attribute value and purposes
to the universe in the unfolding of increasingly greater awareness and intelligence
over billions of years. This presents a very strong teleology; it shows value in the
universe not as it is, now, but in its becoming of ever more value. This means that a
vast amount of the universe as it is now awaits conversion to this greater purpose;
one might say that the universe regards itself as a source of raw material for its own
project. The value of humans is transitory; we represent the best thing yet, but we are
a step on the way. We have reached the limits of the intelligence created by the forces
of biological evolution, but evolution has been canny enough to produce creatures
capable of overcoming mere biology and the limits of their own intelligence by
creating artiﬁcial intelligence that can be reproduced in many forms and that can
recursively self-improve.
Debunking or justifying value Let us consider an aspect of the divergence in
views on the source of value. Something may explain another thing, or it may
explain it away. In questions of value, the identiﬁcation of the underlying source
or reason for something may be one which justiﬁes it, or which debunks it. Russell
proposes that the source of our values is us, ourselves, and identiﬁes value with our
preferences, noting some difﬁcult complexities to this question. Humans simply are
the foundation of value, since there is nothing else beyond them. That’s where the
buck stops. Likewise, an ethic that attempts to be empirically based, such as
utilitarianism, places the ultimate source of value on biologically mediated factors
such as the experiences of pleasure and pain (see Sect. 6.2.1), which Bentham
described in his principle utility thus: ‘Nature has placed mankind under the gover-
nance of two sovereign masters, pain and pleasure. It is for them alone to point out
what we ought to do, as well as to determine what we shall do’ [13].
Tegmark sees a problem with at least some human values—that they may be mere
products of evolution and hence can be explained away. He considers the prospect
that the future may be populated by self-replicating AIs, but not by us, and suggests
that a reason for disliking this is fear of death, which evolution found useful to instil
in us. The origins of this fear in an evolutionary heuristic device, together with the
idea that biological constraints are both transitory and limiting, may lead to the
conclusion that fear of death is for the faint-hearted and those behind the times if we
consider the timescale of the universe.
Note how vastly different frames of ethics may arise. On one view, human life is
the ultimate value, either because humans are valued in and of themselves or because

all other values depend upon it: without life, no preferences can be fulﬁlled, no goals
can be met, and no happiness can be experienced. The fear of death is thus not
simply a product of evolution but an expression of the value that we accord to life.
That’s why the right to life is the primary right and murder the most heinous crime.
Of course, one might also value life but have overcome the existential dread that
frequently accompanies this fear: that’s a different matter, as removing the dread of
death in this way does not remove the value of life. On the other view, fear of death is
simply some quirk of evolution and shows nothing whatsoever about human value.
Paradoxically, Tegmark’s view might actually do better than Russell’s in insisting
that there is meaning in the world, which for many undergirds the sense that life is
valuable and worth living.
11.3
Contrasting Frameworks Behind Visions of AI and Approaches to Ethics
467
Exercise 5
Discuss these opposing views of the value of life. (And by the way, please do ensure
you continue to think your own life is valuable!)
Include in your consideration those futurists who look to attaining some manner
of immortality through uploading minds to machines. Consider too the possibility
that this might radically impact how we see ourselves as individuals separate from
other minds.
Nonetheless, although humans may be transitory bearers of value, they have a
pivotal role in Tegmark’s vision; the agents by which the teeming multitudes of self-
aware intelligences will come forth. Moreover, despite a seeming attribution of
purposes to the universe itself, it is we who are burdened with an immeasurable
responsibility, since it could all go wrong, if we design AI badly, or if we wipe
ourselves out ﬁrst. Tegmark considers it highly possible that we are the only
intelligent life form in the universe capable of producing advanced technology. It
may also be a useful heuristic to consider that this could be the case if it encourages
us to be cautious about destroying the life we have here on Earth. We are the
guardians of a glorious future, which we are probably not good enough to be
included in ourselves. An additional source of precarity is the essential need for
awareness in order fully to realise value on Tegmark’s account. This leads to the
residual worry that whether machines can achieve this awareness depends upon
being right about certain views of the mind-body problem and for the possible
realisation of sentience in the particular machines that come about. If awareness is
needed for value to come into being, the worst future for the universe would be of
one ﬁlled to the brim with nothing but zombies. If humans were brought along for
the ride, they would be some kind of ‘awareness archive’ forming a safety net
perhaps. Perhaps we would become collectors’ items and a source of blank, insen-
tient curiosity.
Exercise 6
Should we build into the scenarios that any advanced artiﬁcial intelligence should be
designed so that it kept some humans alive as pets, as it were, or in some kind of zoo,
as a precaution against the zombie problem? How different, if at all, might this

strategy be from other approaches to the dangers of superintelligence where the goal
is to ensure human survival and ﬂourishing?
468
11
Our Future with AI: Future Projections and Moral Machines
The contrast between these two worldviews is striking, yet they can both readily
be traced as ﬁtting comfortably into a Western cultural and intellectual history.
Russell’s view bears characteristic hallmarks of some central strands of Enlighten-
ment thinking: man as the measure of all things, the universe as inert, meaningless,
with no inherent purpose or value, apart from the sparks of value-creating beings
clinging to a pale blue dot somewhere, the humans [14]. A ﬁrm division between fact
and value, and the value of intelligence set instrumentally by the goals we put in it.
Tegmark’s view bears remarkable parallels with Biblical accounts of creation and
humanity’s role in it, albeit with certain major differences. The creation account in
the ﬁrst chapter of Genesis is not simply a neutral scientiﬁc description of the origins
of the world; repeatedly during the 7 days of making the world, God looks at
Creation and ‘sees that it is good’; the attribution of value to the world comes before
the creation of mankind, which is on the sixth day. Adam, the ﬁrst human, was made
in the image of God and given stewardship over the animals. Nonetheless, humanity
is fallen, and things quickly go badly wrong. Certain individuals, starting from
Abraham, who is promised by God that he and his descendants, the people of Israel,
are to be charged with particular responsibilities for setting humanity back on track,
are given a mission covering multiple generations. Note that Tegmark even talks
about future artiﬁcial entities populating the universe as our ‘descendants’, and
note that God promised Abraham that ‘I will multiply your offspring as the stars
of the sky’ (Genesis 26:4) [15].
In Tegmark’s account, there is no god, a major difference and one which perhaps
owe its origins to the kind of scientiﬁc thinking also behind Russell’s view. Hence, at
the start of the universe, there is no awareness and hence no value in the world.
However, humanity is also given a special status and is also seen as a potential
source of problem, even disaster; we also share in the universe’s awareness and
intelligence. Luckily, among humans, there are some who are taking charge of trying
to ensure that things go right; the technologists, as a group, might ruin everything,
but the good ones among them who also share the universe’s view of progress and
purpose are attempting to save the day. But unlike in Biblical accounts, our own
value is limited. We exist at a pivot point, after which, well, we are only a part of the
universe after all. Hence, there is a mixture of humility and hubris in such a vision.
We can thus perhaps see the immense appeal and popularity of both such
contrasting imaginative visions of the possible future, since the ﬁrst ﬁts well with
modern dominant, ‘sensible’, ‘rational’ ways of seeing the world, and the second ﬁts
well with cultural narratives that have endured and inﬂuenced thinking for centuries.
Both Russell and Tegmark place a very high value on technology. It can also be
useful to compare and contrast these modes of thinking in reﬂecting on what they
both have in common and in understanding more fully why other cultures and
worldviews may take different approaches. The focus on intelligence and knowledge
as values (notwithstanding that intelligence may be given merely instrumental value

by some but not by others) and on the great value given to technology is common to
both, as is the centrality of humans.
11.3
Contrasting Frameworks Behind Visions of AI and Approaches to Ethics
469
Recall the Indigenous Protocol for Artiﬁcial Intelligence Design we met in Sect.
2.9 [16]. Although there are many different indigenous groups, cultures, and lan-
guages, some common themes may be shared, among them concern for locality, for
relationality and reciprocity, and a radically different notion of the place of the
human being in nature and in the world from the positions we have seen above.
While recognising the subtleties, differences, and nuances, in broad terms, humans
may not be given the same unique and very high status. The world is not seen as a
mere resource, and not as inanimate, brute matter. (Although note that Tegmark talks
of the universe in general as awakening.) Animals and other creatures are seen as
being in relationship with humans within nature, and humans are able to live in
reciprocity with them. It has been argued that such attitudes could extend to
machines that humans create and live with [17].
Such approaches also place importance on embodiment, the ﬁne details of its
nature, its value, and the ways in which it enables us to experience our local place in
the world and to interact with others, including animals and the land. Contrast this to
the views of embodiment we see often in some popular takes on AI: human
embodiment as a hurdle to the realisation of value and as an obstacle to our
intelligence, miring us in stupidity and emotion. Such views hold that the mind,
consciousness, awareness, intelligence, these things of value, are not essentially
related to any particular bodies or material substrate, or indeed, essentially related
to any material substrate at all.
However, just as this is of necessity a very brief review of positions, so too,
considerable additional nuance and complexity can be added to the two major
contrasting views that I extracted from Russell and Tegmark. The idea that humans
are made in God’s image and that they are masters of the earth and can do what they
will with it is often attributed simply and plainly to the Bible and to the Judeo-
Christian tradition; we discussed the notion of human dominion over nature earlier in
Sect. 3.4. But the very fact that here ‘Judeo’ and ‘Christian’ are hyphenated together,
plus cursory knowledge of the different forms of both Judaism and Christianity is a
clue to the multiple ways in which the role of humans may be understood and in
which ‘made in God’s image’ may be understood. Some understand this role as
‘dominion’ to mean to do as one wills, but it is at any rate clear from the Bible that
there are limits on the proper exercise of the human will, and there is a strong
tradition that interprets humanity’s role as that of stewardship [18], with visions for a
future of harmony (see Sect. 3.4 and the future picture of nature seen in the book of
Isaiah). Those writing from indigenous perspectives may also place humans as
having particular responsibilities. An optimistic view is that, hence, through such
points of resonance, joint dialogue, understanding, and programmes of action may
be possible.
Recall, too, that although there is a strong tradition within Western ethics of
separating fact from value, reason from emotion, and of understanding ethics in
terms of abstract and universal rules and principles, notions of reciprocity and
accountability to others are also present—indeed, within the key values that we

ﬁnd in codes and regulations for AI. See the value of explainability, transparency,
and accountability, as well as of solidarity and sustainability (although both of these
may be understood in ways which still see humans as the sole source of value within
a world valued only instrumentally).
470
11
Our Future with AI: Future Projections and Moral Machines
Recall, in addition, that concern to (some) animals has been an implicit aspect of
certain ethical theories. Accounts of ethics based on personhood may include some
animal species; accounts based upon the concept of a sentient being may include
more (see Chap. 9). Many of these extend moral concern outwards by the application
of a principle and may hence be very different in kind and in effect from many
indigenous approaches based upon relationality.
Exercise 7
Attempts are being made to use AI to decipher animal language. earthspecies.org is
attempting to interpret animal communication using machine learning techniques
developed to translate human languages without dictionaries. projectceti.org is
attempting to decipher the communications of the sperm whale using machine
learning and robotics. Machine learning has been used in attempts to decipher pig
calls for their emotional valence [19]. Discuss whether and how such work making
use of technologies may impact human-centric views of value.
Consider how different ways of communicating with and interacting with animals
may make for different qualities of relationships.
(Compare: your friend uses machine learning to detect from your tone of voice if
you are upset; versus, your friend listens intently and knows you so well they can tell
straightaway something is up.)
Some who fear superintelligence may picture it as a dystopia in which we are
mere servants, pets, or playthings to superintelligence, or in which we are wiped out
completely by the monster we have created. Attempts are made to ensure that any
future artiﬁcial intelligence remains our tool. An alternative picture, however, is a
reversal of this. We are the mere tools by which something much better than us
emerges in the future. We are the good servant who sacriﬁces him- or herself for one
greater than us. We have seen how it is hard even to make ethical comparisons
between contrasting pictures, since they may rest upon fundamentally different
accounts of the very nature of ethics. The question remains of what is our relation-
ship to AI—not just to particular instances of it but to AI in general, as an idea and an
ideal.
We now ask further questions about the relationships between AI and humans,
focusing on questions of how each is valued and on the idea that AI might be used to
increase the value of humans.

11.4
The Moral Status of AI and Robot Rights
471
11.4
The Moral Status of AI and Robot Rights
Summary
Here we consider the challenges of attributing moral status to artiﬁcial intelligence,
discussing why this may seem more tempting in the case of robots. Various
hallmarks of moral status are considered, including intelligence, language, sentience,
goals and purposes, and a sense of the self. We also consider the relevance of
embodiment for the attribution of an enduring entity with moral status and consider
the complex issue of reciprocal relations and recognition of moral status of us by AI
and of AI by us.
Could we attribute moral value to any form of AI? To answer this question is, in
general, to address what qualities would give an entity rights or make it the recipient
of any other level of moral concern. Hence, any answer will depend upon the general
approach one takes to central questions in moral philosophy. A secondary question is
to address what particular treatment any speciﬁc form of AI might deserve and what
corresponding responsibilities we might have. Here, we give an overview of issues;
the preceding chapters of the book should furnish readers with plentiful material for
addressing and arguing the point. Further reading is found at the end of this chapter.
An essential question is the attribution of value to an entity that has been
produced by humans, over and above the value it has for humans, in a way that
gives this value to the entity itself. The precise manner in which this is meant may be
a little hard to articulate. Certain works of art and other cultural artefacts may be
thought to have value in themselves on some views, but it is not usually held that the
destruction of Botticelli’s The Birth of Venus would be a moral wrong against the
picture itself. The claim we are considering usually seems to attribute some sense in
which the AI itself has some opinion on the matter.
Robot rights The question of the value we accord to AI is often phrased in terms of
‘robot rights’. This is perhaps telling. It is much easier to envisage that we might give
some form of moral value to a robot, ﬁrst, because they are often made to look a bit
‘like us’, and second, because they are generally countable individuals, even though,
unlike us, they can readily be assembled and disassembled, and, unlike us at the
moment, they may be directly connected to a large computing system. We can
envisage what it would be to take a robot and physically destroy it; we can more
or less start to imagine what it might be to treat it well, often thanks to science ﬁction
as well as to the humanoid form some have, or at least, the possession of limb-like
parts. It is harder to imagine how to treat a piece of software well, especially as its
identity seems to be informational rather than physical.
Second, the notion of rights is a relatively constrained and formal way of
recognising value. A world of human relations sketched out in terms of rights
scarcely scratches the surface of what might put ﬂesh on the bones of an outline of
a good life and of good relationships. The bare knowledge that one has a right to
respect for a private and family life, home, and correspondence will not get one very
far in working out how to be a good parent or spouse. Hence, it may be no

coincidence that it may seem easier to talk of such abstract and legalistic concepts
such as rights, than of more intimate concepts such as care and concern, when
discussing the value we might accord to robots, although we should also consider if
these too may have a place.

Our Future with AI: Future Projections and Moral Machines
The question of the legal governance of robots is important, for it involves
questions of the attribution of responsibility for error and accidents and has also
produced concern over questions such as tax issues: if large armies of robots replace
human workers, then this has tax implications for the national insurance to which the
employer would otherwise be liable, for example. The idea of granting legal
personhood to robots has been mooted in various parts of the world [20, 21]. One
might then be tempted to leap to the conclusion that of course robots must be treated
with respect. But a legal person per se is not a natural person; it is, in short, a legal
ﬁction designed to attribute various responsibilities clearly such that lines of
accountability for various matters between human beings and human organisations
are clear, and disputes can be resolved. Although this is an important question in law,
we need not pursue it further here.
Intelligence as an indicator of moral status The obvious ﬁrst candidate indicating
moral status in AI to examine is intelligence, but this in itself does not give an
encouraging start, certainly if we are considering that most of the artiﬁcial intelli-
gence we have currently exhibits only certain very limited aspects of intelligence. In
addition, often these are aspects of intelligence that seem to give no basis for
accrediting moral value per se to the possessor itself, rather than seeing it as a tool
useful for our own purposes, especially given instrumental accounts of intelligence.
It does not seem very plausible that a facility with complex statistical analysis would
grant artiﬁcial intelligence independent moral status. Moreover, it’s not even clear
that reaching some benchmark of artiﬁcial general intelligence which matches
human level intelligence in complexity and range would achieve this either. The
value of human beings may depend upon the possession of a certain degree of
cognitive capacity, but this alone does not seem to present the basis for an account of
their value.
However, perhaps greater intelligence increases moral status in certain ways.
Many are those who would object to such a view, but it’s been commonly held in
various forms. Indeed, it forms one basis for the impetus to increase human intelli-
gence through various forms of human enhancement and also a basis for worries
about this, including the concern that this may lead to a divided society with lower
status accredited to the unenhanced.
Readers may be noting that on accounts such as that of Tegmark, intelligence
might come out as of supreme value, and moreover, that accounts of the good life
derived from philosophers such as Plato and Aristotle highly valued the life of the
intellect. It is worth noting then that the picture of the good life given by Aristotle
includes many virtues we would not typically regard as moral, such as ready wit, and
that his conception of the good life and of virtue was much broader than is typical for
modern accounts of ethics. There is perhaps a certain tension in that although a
certain level of intelligence is essential for moral agency, there can easily be a

wariness about attributing value to intelligence per se, rather than to the underlying
person. Intelligence, or a degree of it, may indicate that the possessor has moral
status but may not be the grounding reason for the moral status.
11.4
The Moral Status of AI and Robot Rights
473
What else might ground a moral status to AI?
Language as an indicator of moral status Language requires intelligence and also
enables communication and hence reciprocity. A facility with language might also
have a better chance of grounding moral value than facility with maths, for example,
since it requires an understanding of the world and of social context, leading more
readily onto other features of the moral life, such as reciprocity and recognition of
others. The question of rights and responsibilities tends to arise with any AI which
possesses considerable facility with language, as we saw in with the LaMDA model
(see Chap. 2). Turing’s imitation game involved a goal of sufﬁcient linguistic subtly
that native speakers would be inclined to attribute an intelligence. The willingness to
move from linguistic ability to the attribution of personhood and/or sentience is also
seen in science ﬁction stories such as the ﬁlm Her [22], where a man falls in love
with an AI with which he interacts solely through computers, and Transcendence, in
which a character’s mind is uploaded to a vast network of computer systems
[23]. The LaMDA debate also perhaps indicates that language per se is not the
issue but rather, what it might represent: a sentience, a mind, behind the language.
Following on from this are certain questions: how might we safely attribute some
kind of mind, and even if we could, what about such a mind might ground moral
status?
How sentience matters Are experiences necessary then for a robot to be the proper
recipient of our moral concern? Do we have to wait until the technology is sufﬁ-
ciently sophisticated that some form of consciousness can be attributed? We then
have to grapple with the ‘other minds’ problem that besets us in general, and in
particular when faced with potential minds greatly different from ours: the dual
problem of ﬁrst, is there another mind there, and second, what is that mind like? And
if it’s sufﬁciently alien to us, how would we ever work out what possible care and
concern we owed it?
Even if we could attribute sentience to a machine, sentience alone may not be
enough to determine how we might treat it. Value judgements attached to sentient
experiences and goals concerning them appear to be necessary. In accounts of
personhood, the attribution of a right to life generally requires the desire to carry
on living. Kant’s notion of a rational agent includes the will to continued life as a
necessity of rational agency [24]. The wrongness of inﬂicting suffering on sentient
beings is because of the quality of experience, pain, and an assessment of this
quality—negative. This seems to imply an experiencing subject with at least the
vestiges of a value system, a motivation away from the negative and towards the
positive. An alternative response might be that, just as we adapt moral responsibil-
ities when considering animals rather than humans and even roughly tailor them to
the needs of speciﬁc species, perhaps we need to adopt a new approach to grounding
an ethics for machines.

474
11
Our Future with AI: Future Projections and Moral Machines
Exercise 8
Suppose a machine had experiences when it perceived the environment. Does
anything follow from this about the quality of the experiences we permit it to
have, or about its continued capacity to experience these? If your answer was ‘no’,
what might have to be added to give us any responsibilities in relation to the
experiences the machine was having?
Goals, purposes, and interests The question of robot rights essentially rides on the
attributes of robots. A robot vacuum cleaner does not feasibly have rights. For what
rights could it possibly have? It would have to have interests of some sort to have
rights; the way that the world goes, would have to make some difference to the robot
vacuum cleaner. There would have to be some complexity here. Suppose a mischie-
vous child worked out that it was possible to make the robot vacuum cleaner go
round in circles and clean the same piece of ﬂoor over and over again until the power
shut off. Explain to me how that violates its rights and I will buy you a beer.
(As philosophers like a good argument, you might try to see if you can ﬁnd a
basis for any rights here.)
Some might reply that interference with the goals of a robot might constitute a
violation of rights; or at any rate, some form of wrong, just as if someone interfered
with a person’s goal to get a cup of cappuccino by giving them a café latte instead,
they might do them some minor wrong, even if this is not infringing anything so
grand as a right. A ready reply is that the goals are not the goals ‘of the robot’: they
were put in the robot by others (see Sect. 8.6). Consider, too, the discussion above of
how some of the goals which humans have might have been ‘put there’ by evolution
and perhaps hence are by their origin debunked, or at least in need of careful
assessment. The robot would have to care about the goal in some way and would
have to have some negative experience of the consequences of having this goal
interfered with.
Embodiment and the enduring attribution of moral status We noted that moral
status and personhood, or at least vestigial personhood, may be more readily applied
to robots. So does that mean that embodiment is necessary to ground the attribution
of moral status? Even if we might possibly attribute moral status to an AI manifest
diffusely through, say, different parts of the Internet via language and communica-
tion with us, this is still a form of embodiment. Continued existence over some
period of time seems necessary for the attribution of goals, preferences, or purposes.
The question of how we individuate entities, or indeed, whether we should do
this, is more perplexing. Indeed, the immortality aspirations of those who plan to
attempt to upload their mind to a machine themselves perhaps include the hope that
their personhood, or enough of it at any rate, will endure and that this therefore
means their moral status (although what precise rights and obligations others have
would doubtless change signiﬁcantly upon disembodiment) [25, 26]. With the
communication hurdles that accompany our embodiment, it may also be challenging
to differentiate one entity from another.

11.4
The Moral Status of AI and Robot Rights
475
Exercise 9
Supposing it were possible successfully to upload your mind to a computer. What
moral respect, what moral rights, would you retain, and what would change as a
result of your disembodiment? Could this thought experiment be useful for consid-
ering what moral respect AI might deserve from us?
A point of view, a sense of the self The discussion has been nudging towards an
idea of a self of some kind, existing over time, and with some interests, goals, or
preferences, no matter how simple; a subjectivity. In Thomas Nagel’s phrase,
perhaps there must be something that it is like to be an entity before it can have
any moral status in its own right [27]. We discussed in Sect. 11.3 the general
question of two contrasting views of the universe: one, as inert, essentially without
meaning, purpose, or value, until put there by us, (or by beings like us); and one as
with the possibility of meaning, awareness, and value immanent within it. (There is a
great variety of such views.) To address the question of whether, and how, we might
attribute some manner of mind, of being, to an artefact, is hence to rub up against
metaphysical, ontological, cultural, religious, and spiritual questions about what the
world is like, what is in it, how we can know, and how we should relate to these
things or entities. This raises the question of what manner of reciprocity, if any,
exists between us and other entities with moral status.
11.4.1
Treating AI ‘As If’ It Is a Person: Reciprocity and Its
Dangers
Earlier, we explored the controversy over the LaMDA model and claims that it may
have developed sentience occasioned by its apparent facility with language. What
about a ‘just in case’ strategy, an approach to AI that treated it as if it had sentience,
or personhood, or some other quality that gave it a certain moral standing?
Exercise 10
Try to think of examples where a strategy of assuming moral status would be the best
policy in relation to humans, any dangers of failing to make this assumption, and any
potential downsides. (Hint: We have already looked at certain examples earlier.)
What beneﬁts and downsides might there be to a ‘just in case’ policy in relation
to AI?
A danger of adopting this policy lies in the reciprocity implied in the recognition
of another being as having moral status, especially if a status approaching person-
hood is attributed. Indeed, concerns about the deleterious impact of attributing
personhood inappropriately to robots are behind calls to ensure that they are always
regarded as our tools and to avoid humanising features [28]. This holds the possi-
bility that a person might ‘fall in love’ with a machine, as in the ﬁlm Her, especially
if this forms an obstacle to developing a relationship with human beings instead. An
additional concern is precisely the lack of reciprocity; there will not be the same

feedback from the other that is present in healthy human relationships, so that the
person in response to the machine might then fail to develop their interpersonal skills
and moral character.
476
11
Our Future with AI: Future Projections and Moral Machines
Conversely, perhaps an AI might be able to assist with this. Indeed, there is
considerable work exploring robotics to assist children with autism to develop
interpersonal skills [29]. The aim in such cases is to facilitate growth and to improve
the capacity for interactions with other humans. What is the point, one may ask, if the
person (i.e. the human!) never then applies these interpersonal skills to ‘real’
persons? Much of the moral concern about sex robots centres on the attribution of
personhood and agency to a machine that cannot actually feel and does not actually
have any wants and desires of its own and the potentially corrupting impact on
relationships between human beings [30]. But if individuals otherwise lack human
interaction, or we imagine a world where we no longer distinguish so sharply
between the ‘real’ and the virtual or the robotic (see Sect. 7.5), perhaps things
would be very different.
How precisely would we treat AI ‘as if’ it had moral standing?
Exercise 11
Suppose LaMDA, or some similar large language model, had attained sentience or
was in some other way considered to have a degree of moral standing. How could we
demonstrate this? What treatment would it deserve? How might it make a difference
to how we interact with it? Could there be some forms of AI where we could more
readily demonstrate our moral concern than others?
How AI treats us So far, we have considered how we might treat robots or other
forms of AI, but what about how AI treats us? Interaction between moral agents,
between persons, involves a reciprocity that can take many forms, which may be
more or less appropriate to different occasions and different agents and relationships,
and may approach or deviate from certain ideals. Note that a feature of such
interpersonal, or interagent, interactions is that they can make a difference to either
party. Hence, if you are being treated by another party as if you are a person of great
interest, value, and worth, this can be very life-afﬁrming and even transformative,
but disrespect and maltreatment can leave its mark, major and minor. We considered
earlier in some examples the situation of care robots and the appropriateness or
otherwise of interactions between such robots and people. There is a considerable
body of work in human-computer interactions, much of which is speciﬁcally
concerned with human-robot interactions [31].
Now consider the myriad of different ways in which we interact with AI all
around us. Consider how people may be manipulated when their behaviour and
actions are nudged and persuaded by social media and other aspects of the tracking
devices that may feed information back to us. So this may be a very mixed economy
of technology, where some is adopted with intentions of self-management, perhaps,
and other aspects are by no means consciously chosen.
It was suggested earlier that in this way, persons may be looked at from the
outside on a quasi-behaviourist model, where certain goals may be set by us, but in

other ways, our behaviour and even thoughts may be moulded by the technology and
those designing and applying it. Might there be a troubling sense then, in which ‘we’
are seen as persons but as persons who can be manipulated? And might there be a
sense, then, that it might possibly be useful, as a heuristic device, to see the
technologies which are doing this also as a kind of person, a moral agent, one
diffused into a motely array of hardware and software? This might then turn our
attention towards the corporations and individuals who are jointly responsible for
creating and implementing the accumulated technologies that shape our lives.

Machines as Moral Agents: Could Artiﬁcial
Intelligence Enhance Human Morality?
Summary
The question of whether machines could ever be moral agents is one of the earliest
tackled in the ﬁeld of AI ethics and is one of great complexity, since it rests upon
claims about the capacities of AI, about the nature of moral decisions and actions, the
capacities needed for morality, and a detailed examination of the relevant strengths
and weaknesses of both humans and AI. We focus on the narrower question of
whether AI might act as a moral guide and on its capacities to provide us with
knowledge relevant to making moral judgements.
Following on from the question of what moral obligations we might owe intelligent
machines and whether machines might be moral patients in any sense, are questions
about whether intelligent machines could become moral agents. Like the ﬁrst
question, this depends upon what conception we have of the nature of morality
and of what is required to make a moral judgement and to act upon it.
Signiﬁcant work in this area is among some of the earliest work speciﬁcally on AI
ethics (not forgetting the earlier work on computer ethics). Moral Machines by
Wendell Wallach and Colin Allen was published in 2008 and presents an extensive
account of the questions of why we might need machines to be moral and distin-
guishes two possible approaches: a top-down approach to determining a moral
stance and attempting to engineer this into machines, and a bottom-up approach
that starts at the ground and attempts to integrate aspects ethics into machines
following a developmental approach in attempts to mirror the developmental path-
ways via which humans acquire moral judgement and behaviour [32].
Having recently been grappling with the question of whether an advanced
artiﬁcial intelligence is likely to run amok turning us into obsolete stationery items
and having seen some of the pessimism and worried concern at the prospects of
controlling superintelligence, one might with some justiﬁcation scoff at the notion
that AI might be some kind of moral agent. Indeed, the discussions of how we might
be able to control superintelligence and try to ensure that it does not act in ways
signiﬁcantly counter to our values and our interests are directly relevant to the

question of whether a machine could be a moral agent. We have seen how difﬁcult it
might be to ensure that it does not become a grossly immoral or amoral agent.
478
11
Our Future with AI: Future Projections and Moral Machines
However, on the conception of artiﬁcial intelligence which rests on an instru-
mental account of intelligence, it is we who input the goals. So this leaves upon the
possibility that we could construct it to assist us morally, especially since the dangers
arising from superintelligence will not apply in machines with more limited capacity.
We would just have to programme it to pursue moral goals in the right way. Of
course, sadly, this is a pretty ambitious idea. The project of attempting to engineer
ethics into machines runs into the stumbling block that we have not managed it in
humans very well yet. Moreover, many—indeed, virtually all—of the cases we have
examined in the book have concerned ethical difﬁculties that arise when we attempt
to design and deploy artiﬁcial intelligence. The actual AI we have looked at and
which is developed to date appears to have nothing that would qualify as moral
insight, compassion, or even common sense or decency, even though it may
sometimes be useful for reaching morally desirable goals.
Work in this area mixes work considering what we might reasonably expect from
AI that we have now or may develop soon, with speculation about what an ideal
form of AI might potentially become, perhaps including the capacity for sentience,
compassion, feelings, and other aspects of human nature that seem to be centrally
involved in our moral responses. We can distinguish between machines that behave
in ways that align with our goals and values, which could be called moral machines
in a residual sense, and machines that themselves can act as moral agents in a more
substantial sense. Asking the question of whether any form of artiﬁcial intelligence
could amount to a moral agent will require that we think about the nature of
intelligence and its role in morality, as well as other questions such as how AI
might gain knowledge and perceive the world, and relate to (other) moral beings,
such as us. The area is particularly fraught with complexity since it involves not
simply careful consideration of the capacities that AI currently has, speculation
about what capacities it might develop but also a multitude of different views of
ethics, of how we come to moral judgements, and what human failings in ethics are.
Any moral machines we might wish to produce would in theory be idealised
moral agents. This if you like is the other side of the coin of those value alignment
projects which simply have the more modest goals that AI does not positively act
counter to our moral values. We obviously want all our machines to align broadly
with our values in the sense of preventing clearly recognisable problems. We don’t
want a computer to give its users electric shocks (as my laptop has been doing
lately), and if we are using AI and other technologies to deliver complex results, this
may be a highly intricate task. It can also be seen simply as part of good engineering,
which has standards of safety and aims to fulﬁl the speciﬁcations of the task. Trying
to work out how to produce a moral machine requires not simply that we make a
machine that does what we want it to do but that the machine also understands
morality in some way, and this is much harder to specify.
If an algorithm was designed to match organs for transplant to recipients in need
of them, the algorithm would not be sweating and sighing with concern over the
gravity of the task, any more than if it was matching designer handbags to the

appropriate celebrity. If fed preprogrammed criteria, it is not clear in which sense it
would be called a moral machine, other than that we were using it for a task with
weighty implications, and in this case, judgements will often have to be made with
serious consequences given the need for a medically good match and the mismatch
between organ supply and demand.
11.5
Machines as Moral Agents: Could Artiﬁcial Intelligence Enhance. . .
479
A project of attempting to build human-level intelligence into machines is
obviously not going to attempt to incorporate human-level common cognitive errors;
it’s going to try to incorporate an idealised version of human-level intelligence: we
are not going to programme in a moderate capacity to hear pitch and a rather
mediocre ability to read musical notation. However, we know what correct answers
in arithmetic should be (well, for much of it; even mathematics is not so simple); we
have examples of people working out the correct methodology to achieve these
answers. There are many other areas of endeavour in the empirical sciences where
methodology may be less certain and where gathering and evidence may be complex
and hard. By and large, in ethics it is even worse. We can’t just copy and paste
correct ethical judgement and action, plus the means by which we found the answer,
into a machine.
This all means that it is actually rather challenging to specify what we might even
be looking for in a moral machine, even one that might be only a partial moral agent,
which might help us with difﬁcult moral questions. Perhaps a machine could help us
with certain moral questions, but perhaps calling a machine a ‘moral’ machine might
overstate what it can actually do.
The question of whether machines could be moral agents is large and complex, so
we will organise and narrow our discussion by addressing the question of whether
machines could help to enhance us morally or assist to make us form better moral
judgements and take more appropriate actions. This will involve considering if
machines might incorporate at least some of the elements that go to constitute
moral agency. If intelligent machines are moral agents in any sense, then they
could have some capacity to contribute to our moral life. Artiﬁcial intelligence has
been envisaged for use in addressing discrete or speciﬁc moral issues. We could see
using AI to help us in moral decision and action as an aspect of human enhancement
(on one plausible view, a particularly important aspect of it). We might ﬁnd that
some AI could be of limited use in assisting a small amount with our myriad failures,
or perhaps we might ﬁnd that it has the potential to be altogether better than us.
We will need to ask how human moral agency fails and what corresponding
abilities or failings AI might have. The answers may be revealing of how we
understand morality, how we understand human beings and human weakness, how
we understand intelligent machines, and what hopes we might have for them. The
hopes some cherish for intelligent machines may be held up and used as a yardstick
by which to measure the hope and despair that there might be for human potential for
good, and human failings.

480

Our Future with AI: Future Projections and Moral Machines
11.5.1
Why Would We Even Want a Machine to Help Us
with Moral Issues?
Of course, there is nothing to wonder at the attempt to improve one’s moral
judgements and actions, given the parlous state of human morality and the frequent
times when a person might have wished for further insight, or in hindsight, realised
that mistakes had been made. A more interesting question is why we might want a
machine to do this, rather than a friend or a person with some particular moral
authority we recognise, be it someone older and wiser, a religious leader, a teacher.
One simple answer might be because the machine might be ‘on’ all the time and
readily available via an app or a device in our pocket. A worse answer is to avoid the
opprobrium of others if the morally difﬁcult situation we are in is especially delicate,
one of our own making, or ensure that others do not, in fact, discover that we didn’t
act as we judged best.
Aside from this, why might we want a machine to help? Since we struggle
ourselves, it may be that a machine has some weaknesses compared to us but also
some capacities that may make up for some of our shortcomings. So in order to break
down this question, we need to understand what the tasks of morality are, what our
likely moral failings are, and whether some form of artiﬁcial intelligence might have
useful contributions to offer, and what these might be. This is another example where
we compare machine and human agency and capabilities, but a particularly complex
one, because there are rather different accounts available of what the tasks of
morality are, how these should be accomplished, and what is needed to accomplish
these. Much of the material earlier in the book, especially Chaps. 4–7, will be
relevant to understanding these issues.
Exercise 12
Before we continue, write a list of what aspects of morality humans ﬁnd difﬁcult,
what particular moral weaknesses humans tend to have, and any thoughts you have
on any reasons we might have for using a machine to assist us morally, rather than
another human being.
There are countless ways to proceed through these questions. The topic is in many
ways a review of the entire book. It will rest upon a view of how moral judgements
are made, what the purpose of morality is, on ideas of human nature, the role of
agency in ethics, and much more. Since we are dealing with artiﬁcial intelligence, a
particular focus of our discussion will be on the issue of moral knowledge and how
AI might assist us with shortcomings in relation to knowledge and information
processing. We will consider the different tasks that ethics involves and then take
a simple suggested example of an artiﬁcial moral adviser, using that as a concrete
prop from which to ask further questions about the capacity of AI to assist us with
morally relevant information.

11.5
Machines as Moral Agents: Could Artiﬁcial Intelligence Enhance. . .
481
11.5.2
Analysing the Different Tasks of Morality
Let us start with an initial idea that using AI as some kind of moral aide might be
possible. As discussed, to understand the question of whether AI could be a moral
agent in any way, or could assist us to address our moral questions, we need to have a
view on many aspects of ethics, and so this topic will always be controversial in
some way. We need to start somewhere and a good place to start is by looking in
some detail at the different elements of addressing a moral problem. We could divide
moral tasks into various subtasks.
First, to understand that there is a question that needs to be asked, a problem to be
solved, a choice to be made. This is an issue of attention to the world, attention to
some lack, some judgement that needs to be made, a noticing of the need for extra
effort or particular skills. In Sect. 7.2.5, we looked at a question slipped into Kant’s
account of duties that to determine whether an action is in accordance with the moral
law, we ﬁrst need to realise that we must ask this.
One might answer that on certain normative ethical theories, this is not needed.
For a maximising consequentialist, every single occasion for action is an occasion
for moral judgement. (That is precisely one argument in its favour; and simulta-
neously, an argument against it.) One simply needs to calculate the relevant conse-
quences, either for each separate occasion, or, more realistically, using general rules
of thumb or habitually applicable programmes. One still may need to recognise that
an exceptional set of circumstances arises, where rules of thumb, habitual sources of
information and calculation may be inadequate. Likewise, one might answer that for
a virtue ethicist, the task of ethics is to live the best life, act in accordance with
virtues, and so one is always in the ‘on’ mode for ethics. This will lead to very
different levels of difﬁculty for different individuals; life is often run-of-the-mill and
noticing some new or unusual challenge may prompt a reappraisal; and we know
lives can go off track for want of attention to the demands of one’s circumstances.
Second, having understood that a judgement is needed, the judgement must be
made. How will depend of course on the situation and upon normative ethical theory.
Since moral judgements are supervenient upon the state of the world, gathering
relevant facts may always be needed, whatever view of the nature of ethics one
accepts, as well as appreciation of the relevance of those facts, on which, more
presently. Calculating the relevant rules that may apply and their relative priority
may be needed, or judging the virtues relevant to a situation and making ﬁne-tuned
appraisals of how precisely to express them.
Exercise 13
Consider and contrast using a machine to help you to come to a moral judgement
with using a machine to make a moral judgement in your place. Drawing on your
understanding of ethical theory, what different perspectives might there be on this?
Third, we then need to act in an appropriate manner and at an appropriate time.
We do not always do this. You may have noticed.

482
11
Our Future with AI: Future Projections and Moral Machines
Exercise 14
Consider what might stop a person from acting according to their best moral
judgement. Are there any ways in which AI might be able to assist humans
with this? Be as inventive as you wish.
If AI solved this problem by acting in our place, would this be a satisfactory
solution? Does it matter if we act willingly, or only that we act in the right way?
Alternative accounts exist of how we might parse out the different tasks of
morality. The above distinction between forming a moral judgement, and in
response, acting, allows the possibility of a slip between judgement and behaviour.
In contrast, on some accounts, full knowledge of the correct moral thing to do leads
immediately to action. There is no need for further moral motivation.
11.5.3
Elements of Moral Competence: What We Need
in Order to Act Like Moral Agents
If we need an account of the tasks of morality, which as we have seen, will be
complex and disputed, we must also have an account of what competencies we need
in order to accomplish these tasks [33]. There may be more than one account of such
competencies and hence more than one account of how the particular weaknesses of
human beings could be assisted by AI.
Let us consider a list of moral competencies given by Malle [33] in a paper on
machine morality: a moral vocabulary, a system of norms, moral cognition and
affect, moral decision-making and action, and moral communication. A quick
analysis of these will reveal some areas where AI might be more promising than
others. Since this is the last chapter, let us do this much of this in the form of
exercises, especially since one of the main aims of the book is to respect and enhance
the moral autonomy of readers.
Moral vocabulary and moral communication:
Exercise 15
Drawing on our discussions of language and communication in Chap. 9 and Sect.
7.4, consider the challenges for AI of entering into moral dialogue with humans.
Consider particularly questions of context and especially how it relates to moral
issues and how a machine might have the capacities to grasp the context necessary to
understand moral language. Could a machine have any capacity to correct humans
on their failure to grasp context in moral judgements?
A system of norms:
Exercise 16
The requirement of possessing a system of norms could cover many possibilities,
given the variety of approaches to ethics. Suppose these consist of a set of goals
and/or a set of rules to be followed. There will be challenges in instantiating goals

and rules in AI, including issues of how these are interpreted. Based on any prior
material in the book or elsewhere, do you see any particular ways in which these
issues may be even more acute in the case of moral judgements?

Cognition and affect:
Exercise 17
To include the competence of ‘moral cognition and affect’ covers a multitude of
complexities. Drawing on previous material (see, e.g. Sect. 7.2.5 on moral under-
standing and general discussions on moral epistemology elsewhere in the chapter).
Assuming that AI capable of affect is far from development, even if it can be
developed, in what ways, if any, might lack of affect be a hurdle? In what ways
might it be a beneﬁt to assisting human moral judgement? Again, see Chap. 7 for
much relevant material.
11.5.4
Is Using a Machine as a Moral Adviser Permissible?
An answer to this question was implied in Exercises 13 and 14. In thinking about this
question, one of the ﬁrst issues that might have occurred to you is that the very
probity of using a machine to make a moral judgement is up for question and that
from the perspective of different normative moral theories, very different answers
may be given. To a large extent, these different answers relate closely to the different
tasks that making a moral judgement involves on each of these three approaches and
thus what the machine might be doing for us.
Let us simplify matters by taking consequentialism as a simple happiness-based
utilitarianism. The only thing that matters is that the best consequences occur overall,
and hence, if using a machine provides better results, then it even seems it might be
mandatory to do so. Your responsibilities would be fulﬁlled. It might even be
possible to get a machine to act in your place. The machine could have great facility
in rapid calculation of consequences, plus in calculating models to project the future,
although as we shall see below, there are more complexities to this than might at ﬁrst
appear. Indeed, for complex tasks, it may even be mandatory to use computing
power, and it could seem ideal, especially in cases necessitating speed. For tasks
involving calculations such as crop forecasting and weather forecasting, it is difﬁcult
to see how we could have a hope without using considerable computing power.
For a rule-based ethic, suppose we had a machine that was able to calculate if a
rule applies, how it applies, and how to deal with any clash of rules and their relative
priority. This could be used, for example, in calculating complex tax issues. An
accountant would have responsibility for ascertaining the accuracy of such calcula-
tions. Would this be enough in the case of ethics to fulﬁl one’s moral responsibility?
The answer for Kant, as we saw (see Sect. 1.10), was that one must act with the
correct motivation and understanding of what one is doing. Even those who do not
agree with the Kantian interpretation of the moral law may recognise the need to

fully understand and to take on board as one’s own any of our judgements which we
think of as moral.
484
11
Our Future with AI: Future Projections and Moral Machines
However, it may be challenging to articulate how to draw the line around the
kinds of judgements to which this notion of responsibility applies. Would it be
enough if one were willing to check the machine periodically or be prepared to
answer any complaints? Perhaps it might also be possible to learn from the machine
how better to interpret rules and reﬂect upon how to deal with clashes. So a moral
adviser would be possible, but its use might be more of a joint enterprise than might
be the case for a consequentialist approach.
Alternatively, one might consider that it only matters that a rule is applied
rigorously, not the motivation behind its application. Perhaps having the correct
motivation is a part of an entire system of rules but need not be tangibly manifest in
particular applications of rules that form part of a wider system. So just as a judge
may have the general motivation to uphold the principles of justice, trust in the
automatic application of a rule derived from this system on a particular occasion may
not be necessary, and a machine may manage this better than we could. A reasonable
example where AI might fare better than human judgement might be dealing with
complex cases of fraud.
Exercise 18
We have reﬂected on such matters previously, for example, in considering the
COMPAS algorithm case in Sect. 2.4.3, which you may wish to review. Consider
also the issues raised above in Exercise 13 and the general questions of context and
pragmatics we discussed in Chap. 9. Do these considerations impact your view of
whether or when it might be permissible to use AI to apply moral rules? Consider the
issue of discretion.
For a virtue ethicist, the idea of getting a machine to make a moral judgement
rather than doing it oneself seems almost laughable, not simply because it may be a
dereliction of responsibility, but because in the unlikely event that a person has fully
developed the virtues and attained an ideal state of moral wisdom, the machine
seems redundant. If they have not, the use of a machine passes up the chance to
practice the art of the moral considerations which lead to the development of virtue,
if the machine is simply going to deliver the moral judgement to you. Unless,
perhaps, a machine might be able to help with this, taking the role of the society
and the admirable people of virtue who act as guides and role models.
Exercise 19
It may seem on the face of it unlikely that a mere machine could form a useful part of
how we might develop moral virtue. Is this too dismissive? Think through if there
are any realistic possibilities and whether machines might also have a tendency to
lure us away from the path of virtue.
We have seen (Sect. 7.2.5) that there are many accounts of what is needed to form
moral judgements, including close attention to the other, and entering into certain
forms of discourse and discussion with others. These approaches also seem to
present certain obstacles to the simple use of a machine to assist with moral

judgement. Let us consider some suggestions for the use of moral AI from those who
see more possibilities in the area.

11.5.5
How Could We Build a Moral Machine? An Example
Let us start with a suggestion for one basic possibility of using a machine as an
artiﬁcial moral adviser. There have been various suggestions around this theme, plus
considerable reﬁnement and critique. A paper by Giubilini and Savulescu builds
upon a paper by Roderick Firth describing an ‘ideal observer’ that is consistent and
impartial in its judgements [34, 35]. Their artiﬁcial moral adviser retains these
qualities but lacks the absolutism found in Firth’s account because it is programmed
to take into account its human owner’s personal principles and values rather than to
take a universal stance as Firth’s ideal observer does. In this way, it is claimed that it
will enhance moral autonomy as well as helping with some limitations of human
psychology, such as prejudices. Human moral shortcomings of concern include
information processing, for we often do not possess or consider all information
relevant to a judgement; moral judgement, since we are often inconsistent and fail to
stick to our own values in our judgements; and moral agency, since we often fail to
act on our best moral judgements.
Note that the example given is narrow: to use technology to assist humans in
making decisions given ﬁxed and limited moral criteria and moral instructions. A
speciﬁc example is analysed of choosing a restaurant, given that as well as wishing
for a cheap, good, nearby restaurant, one is also concerned with animal welfare. The
software would gather available information about the possible restaurants, model
this information against the criteria that the owner had put into the system, and could
then calculate expected utility at a faster and more efﬁcient rate than a human could,
giving restaurant suggestions.
More details are given in the paper explaining the approach, of course, but the
modest goal of this particular example is apparent. Choosing a restaurant is after all a
luxury option for billions of people who could rarely or never afford to eat out.
Moreover, speciﬁc information even in relation to these goals will be hard to
ascertain, since the full animal welfare cost of each restaurant choice could involve
an incredibly long chain of questions (the particular paint used on the walls, the
leather seats, what they do about vermin control) and ‘animal welfare’ could mean
many things and is not speciﬁed. Moreover, from where does the artiﬁcial moral
adviser gather these data? One can also ask, what is it about these choices that make
them moral choices? A clue to address these is how the ‘moral’ aspect of the choice
is included in a list of presumably nonmoral choices: how much further would one
wish to walk for a certain gain in animal welfare? And how are these ranked together
in a ‘utility’ score? For a consequentialist, this might sound ﬁne, but the personal
nature of this example shows that this does not amount to any standard ethical form
of consequentialism, since different people can programme the device in
different ways: with different sets of considerations, and different rankings

(e.g. ranking food quality and décor far above animal welfare). The lack of general
applicability makes this seem a choice of personal preference, and little more. We
should be asking more questions about whether our moral choices are simply a
variety of general choices, whether there is anything distinctive about how these
choices are made, and the manner in which these choices are made.
486
11
Our Future with AI: Future Projections and Moral Machines
Exercise 20
Drawing on any previous material (e.g. discussions of preference in relation to
Russell’s approach to superintelligence, discussions of consequentialism and utili-
tarianism in general), would you think of this as a moral adviser, per se, or simply a
device for narrowing down restaurant choice? Do you consider there is any differ-
ence between moral decisions and any other decision we make, and if so, can a sharp
line be drawn?
The sheer complexity of the tasks of gathering and assessing information and
delivering a suggested course of action is apparent with the restaurant example but is
even clearer with another example application given by these authors, assisting
policy makers to make rational decisions in public emergency situations, where it
is suggested that a computer could ‘immediately’ gather relevant information and
provide estimates of the likely spread of the disease and suggest policy options [34,
p. 174]. The paper was published in 2018. The world is now sadly familiar with the
complexities and myriad problems with the modelling of such scenarios and the
political, ethical, medical, and other implications of policy choice [36]. Furthermore,
in such situations, questions of accountability for taking such serious decisions are
paramount; the very idea that we should just ‘follow the science’ has been taken
apart not simply because the information and modelling is likely to produce a range
of different suggestions but because there are moral and political choices to be made
[37]. It is not universally settled that ‘health’ is a value that overrides all others (see
Sect. 4.1.3); nor is there one notion of health [38], and different measures may stress
different aspects of health and have different impacts on different demographics
[39]. The nature of the demands for accountability from decision-makers and from
those implementing decisions will be different when we are dealing with such value
issues, rather than simply crunching numbers and dealing in ‘facts’ as if we agree
with Dickens’ Mr. Gradgrind that ‘Facts alone are wanted in life’ [40].
Here is one possible difference to get us going: I am faced with a choice of
drink—English Breakfast tea, Earl Grey tea, or cola. It’s easy. I don’t like cola, and I
prefer English Breakfast to Earl Grey. I never have the problem of choosing cola and
then living to feel guilt and remorse; I am never tempted to choose it, I genuinely
dislike it. I never have to ask my friend, let alone my priest, to remind me never to
choose cola again. If I occasionally choose Earl Grey, I never ruminate on this choice
or lose a day’s sleep over it; I choose it sometimes for a change. Something else is
going on with moral choices. I should not choose to tell a convenient lie simply ‘for a
change’. The crunch might come with the moral adviser restaurant app if the owner
repeatedly
turned
off
the
‘animal
welfare’
in
favour
of
top
marks
for
‘Instagrammability’ (and what about showing concern for animal welfare while

ignoring obvious signs of money laundering and suspicions that kitchen staff are the
victims of human trafﬁcking?).

11.5.6
AI as Moral Assistant: Can It Help Us
with the Knowledge Needed for Better Moral
Judgements?
We need to think more carefully about how AI might contribute to speciﬁcally moral
questions. This discussion will consolidate much past material and, in many ways,
address old issues from a different angle. We will continue to focus on the question
of the capacity of AI to help us by providing and analysing the information and
knowledge we need, since that seems the most promising candidate among its
current strengths. It may at ﬁrst sight seem obvious that artiﬁcial intelligence may
offer considerable advantages in the gathering of the knowledge needed to ground
moral judgements and decisions compared to human capabilities. It can process vast
amounts of information extremely rapidly, far faster than we can, and analyse it with
techniques beyond human capabilities. This means it can take a much wider view
than any one person or even a group of people. Technology can also gather material
in ways that are beyond the powers of ordinary humans, scraping the Internet for
information, using sensors, analysing images in ways the human eye cannot, and so
on. More is good, right? Fast is good, right? It may appear as if AI might be able to
stand as some manner of an ideal observer, especially if we can rid it of the biases
that originate in humans, producing an impartial and complete picture, or certainly
more complete than humans could. However, we need to ask, ﬁrst, if it is capable of
producing such a complete picture of knowledge on which to base moral decisions;
and second, if this is even what is needed.
The ﬁrst kind of moral knowledge needed is a kind of attention. Our lack of
proper attention to the world, our capacity to fail to notice the demands of morality,
has already been discussed (see Sect. 7.2.5). This deﬁnitely ranks as a common
human failing. Much technology that we have currently is very adept at focusing our
attention, often to our detriment. The capacity that AI would have to have would be
to focus our attention in morally relevant ways, and I know of no plausible means on
the horizon whereby this could be accomplished.
A problem is that it is extremely difﬁcult to give an account of how such moral
sensitivity is achieved. States of affairs in the world that seem normal and ‘just how
things are’ from one point of view may be seen as in need of attention from another.
Perhaps the best accounts philosophically of how such attunement is acquired and
developed are found in approaches such as virtue ethics and the notion of phronesis
or in approaches stressing the importance of ﬁne-tuned attention to the other and to
the quality of discourse communication and discussion with others. A redescription
of circumstances, a fresh angle, the prompting of a friend, can help (see Sect. 7.2.5).
On the other hand, that great exponent of practical wisdom, of phronesis, Aristotle,

considered that a class of human beings were naturally slaves [41]. How well could
an intelligent machine perform, if at all?
488
11
Our Future with AI: Future Projections and Moral Machines
One answer might be that the machine can far more rapidly than we can, collect
and analyse data. But analyse it how? For there is no formula to follow. The mass of
data may only make this worse. The issue is one known within artiﬁcial intelligence
as framing, of how to spot the wood for the trees in more ordinary parlance, and has
been discussed in moral philosophy as a problem of moral relevance. What facts
among a world full of facts, which aspects of a situation, including the things that are
missing from that situation, which of these must be taken into account? The world is
not marked with little red buttons indicating ‘moral problem alert’, or if it is, most of
us are oblivious to them.
Let us suppose then that we have identiﬁed that there is a moral question to be
addressed. Let us suppose that one has a vague idea of what this question is. (This
often happens to humans; nothing more than a feeling of unease or a realisation of
guilt.) Now we have to gather relevant facts.
It is often assumed that artiﬁcial intelligence will be able to obtain all the data that
we need and that there is a limitless supply of it. Indeed, Russell notes that people
often simplistically assume that superintelligence will be omniscient [42]. There are
several problems here. One is that we often do not have enough data. Data are not in
limitless supply. It has to be gathered. In fact, we’re often short of it even for speciﬁc
issues (such as we saw in the training of algorithms for content moderation; see Sect.
9.5.4). Of course, when we do have relevant data, this can be extremely valuable.
The second problem is that there is too much data. Most of it is morally irrelevant.
Data on the physiology of a person, second by second, telling you heart rate, blood
pressure, kidney ﬁltration, liver function, and on and on and on, might be relevant on
occasion, but will not add a jot of relevant detail if it omits to record that that person
A has just plunged a knife into person B’s chest. But what data do we need? The
additional information that person B was heavily armed and ﬁring shots into a crowd
might be more helpful, however. The further information that A was motivated by a
personal grudge against B adds more interest. It is essential to be able to sift out
morally relevant from irrelevant data.
A third problem is that the kind of information we often need to make moral
judgements isn’t the kind of information that a computer could possibly collect as
data. The counterfactual conditional that A would have acted to stop B even in the
absence of a personal grudge is highly relevant but is not precisely a ‘fact’. It cannot
be observed, not even from any kind of brain scan of person A or from seeing what is
actually going on in A’s mind, even if the idea of the ‘full’ content of A’s mind,
conscious thought plus unconscious, could be well-articulated. It cannot be
observed, because it critically depends upon something that might have happened,
but didn’t.
To judge events involving human behaviour, we need to understand causes and
intentions and make judgements of responsibility [33, p. 248]. In understanding
issues of causation and responsibility, as we have indicated previously, there may be
a need for considerable past information, and different accounts and descriptions of
preceding circumstances will produce different readings of a situation. A computer

could possibly quickly run through a myriad of models to test various hypotheses
about relevant counterfactual conditionals about Person A’s action, but these would
remain speculative. It is modelling A’s behaviour. Undertaking this task requires
considerable sophistication. It may not be clear that even those humans who are
gifted at such judgements of character can spell out how they achieve this. Perhaps
it’s a part of phronesis. Recall our discussions in Chap. 9 of Russell’s suggestions
that superintelligence could model our preferences from observing our behaviour for
further relevant thoughts on this.
11.5
Machines as Moral Agents: Could Artiﬁcial Intelligence Enhance. . .
489
Again, the problem of moral relevance is not something uniquely difﬁcult when it
comes to working out how to programme ethics into machines, even just enough to
get them to help us. It is challenging to lay out any general guidance for what
features of a situation will be morally relevant (see Sect. 7.3.2). The relevance of
counterfactual conditionals and the problem of how wide and how far back to go to
describe events and actions make the issue intractable.
Throwing data at the situation may, however, help for something like a conse-
quentialist project of gathering information on speciﬁc goals, such as gathering
information about preferences, the likely happiness or unhappiness, pleasure and
pain of different possible courses of action, indeed, even going far into the future. It
may well be very useful in cases of public policy.
Exercise 21
Consider how, and to what extent, an intelligent machine might gather information
relevant to assessing the happiness and unhappiness of all affected by the possible
courses of action open to one agent at any given moment. Remember that this will
involve having to determine what is relevant to an assessment of happiness. Build in
time considerations.
Now consider if there are any different considerations when gathering informa-
tion relevant to assessing the preferences and their likely satisfaction of all affected.
Compare how a machine might fare compared to a reasonably competent and
diligent human being.
AI and moral development We must address how a machine might acquire the
knowledge that it might draw upon to form moral judgements. Many have specu-
lated that a model of virtue ethics and of human moral development may lead to AI
that has a greater capacity to understand human values and the moral complexity of
the situations we ﬁnd ourselves in [32, 43]. A developmental pathway of the
acquisition of moral understanding and the development of some manner of moral
character could perhaps bring a machine closer to human understanding and form a
more appropriate help. This would, however, necessitate the capacity for affect as
well as cognition, given that for humans, virtues are acquired through membership of
a community with relationships of kinship and mediated through the biological
patterns of our birth, childhood, adolescence, maturity, and death. Such moral
development also needs some form of self-awareness and the capacity to recognise
the moral value and individuality of others. Any account of a machine with such
capabilities that we could draw now would be sketchy and speculative to say the
least.

11.5.7
Data Gathering for Moral Judgements: How Problems
May Arise
And how is data gathered? The possibilities mentioned above of minute tracking of
personal and physiological data could be potentially useful in some possible cir-
cumstances. Those philosophers who have stressed the importance of close obser-
vation and attention to the other, of waiting and listening to a situation, have noted
that such ﬁne-tuned attention can produce knowledge; yet how this translates into
anything we might include in a machine remains to be seen.
Data are gathered in particular ways. Neither our senses nor the perceptual and
information gathering technologies of AI just point to the world and observe it as it
is. Data fed into systems are collected according to various categories and within
limits of accuracy and recording systems. Moreover, it then has to be analysed to
produce any useful information. This analysis will be based upon certain methods
and theories. Some of these theories may hope to reproduce or even exceed the
information gathering expertise of humans, including the subtleties needed for an
ethical response.
The capacities of human beings to relate to and understand each other are both the
basis of good relationships and community and of shortcomings which form a source
of misunderstanding and even tragedy. Efforts are being made to reproduce this in
various ways, one of which is through attempts at facial recognition and emotion
recognition.
Because machine learning gathers and analyses information in ways that differ
from humans, the possibility may be open that ML could be trained to detect things
of moral relevance with more sensitivity than we can. The possibility thus also
appears that this could be another example of technological enthusiasm gone wrong.
Moreover, there is more than one way in which this can go wrong.
The ﬁrst is easier to deal with: making errors that are readily detectable. For
example, claims were made that machine learning could predict criminality from
photographs of faces [44]. The prospects of the Department of Pre-Crime loom, or at
least, of using such information to narrow down on suspects. In this case, it was
readily shown that the photographs used included contaminating information: the
‘criminal’ photographs were prison mug shots and the ‘noncriminal’ photographs
were white collar workers in ofﬁce attire [45], although the authors of the original
paper have issued a response to the numerous criticisms it attracted [46]. Dangers
might present themselves if such errors are not so easy to demonstrate.
However, there is a possibility that the appearance of success may validate hollow
approaches. The capacity to understand the minds of others is critical in human
relations and in ethics. We do this only reasonably well, some better than others and
it can be hard to explain how. The prospect of turning this into some kind of science,
bolstered by technology, may be appealing. There is great interest in using theories
about reading emotions from facial expressions and combining this with machine
learning to feed into decision-making of various kinds. Unfortunately, the theories
upon which such enthusiastic methods are based are open to considerable question

(see, e.g. Sect. 8.7.4). There have been many criticisms of the quality of the work
linking facial expressions to certain human emotions and the categorisation of
emotions this involves [45, 47]. A danger presents itself that enthusiasm about the
technology, including the rush to commercialise, will mean that the dubious nature
of some scientiﬁc claims upon which the technology is based will be overlooked.
11.5
Machines as Moral Agents: Could Artiﬁcial Intelligence Enhance. . .
491
As we have seen, faith in the information produced by technology can also
produce deleterious feedback loops that can produce self-serving prophecies. Note
that this can happen in cases where the aims may be speciﬁcally value-based.
Predictive policing is an area where considerable controversy has arisen over
numerous examples that appear to increase social divisions and bias against certain
communities [48]. Presuming that policing needs a good picture of criminal activity
across the area for which it is responsible and has limited time and resources to
respond to incidents, using AI to gather data and to increase response times seems to
be a good possibility until the feedback loops this creates are taken into account.
Increased police attention to speciﬁc areas will increase the visibility of criminal
behaviour and of any activities deemed ‘suspicious’ relative to those areas that are
not receiving so much attention. Similar harmful feedback loops have been found in
the use of algorithms to make decisions about remanding suspects in custody [49].
In short, many of the very ethical problems that vex the development and
application of AI concern ethical problems generated or worsened by the informa-
tional capacities of AI. It is not looking at all like it is ‘better’ than humans in this
respect, in any simplistic sense.
Perhaps these examples are simply instances of information used badly and
represent teething problems in technology that can be ironed out, applications of
technology inspired by hasty judgement and hubris that can be corrected. Perhaps in
the future, we will have much more data on which to base our judgements and
decisions about action.
Exercise 22
There have been concerns that information about individuals and/or groups may be
misused and/or may have unintended deleterious consequences. Take one or more
examples of the use of AI where there have been concerns that have been raised and
consider carefully whether there are ways in which the situation may be improved
and what these might be or whether there is no way of rendering the example morally
unproblematic. It may be useful to compare two or more examples. Use examples
from earlier in the book, or ﬁnd some of your own.
Remember that we are talking about moral judgements here, not judgements in
general. When amassing safety data for engineering purposes, or in medicine, we
obviously want as full a picture as possible, of the relevant information. There can be
unforeseen possibilities, unfortunate oversights, but in general, the more the merrier
when it comes to information. However, when we are dealing with value issues as in
ethics, the parameters may be less clear. We may be dealing with speciﬁc relation-
ships, obligations, and accountabilities. We may be trying to work out how to live in
a world that we cannot navigate very well because we lack the common signs we
used prior to the creation of new possibilities of knowledge created by technologies.

492
11
Our Future with AI: Future Projections and Moral Machines
New information possibilities may create opportunities but also moral haz-
ards and complex difﬁculties. Data may be gathered or analysed and applied in
novel situations, enabling the possibility of judgement and choice in situations where
previously there had been none. The creation of such options has been numerous in
areas of medicine, especially in genetics, genomics, and fertility. These come
together with AI in the example of an IVF service using donor gametes that promises
to use facial recognition software to maximise the chance that any baby conceived
will resemble the intended parents. Many clinics now offer this service, such as
ovoclinic.net, ivi-fertility.com, and fenomatch.com [50]. Websites suggest that this
service will improve donor matches for all aspects of compatibility, provide peace of
mind, reduce stress, and other beneﬁts. The technique examines thousands of points
of comparison of faces to ﬁnd the best match. Genetic compatibility and phenotypes
are also matched at clinics.
This is a very good example of the incremental additions of possibilities of action
and knowledge that developments in technology of different types can present.
Indeed, a full discussion would merit its own book. There are many complex reasons
why the intended parents may wish their child to resemble them. These include
helping bonding, concern to avoid any remarks about the different appearance of the
child, and other reasons. A feature of parenting is a large element of the unknown,
and many have concerns that we are heading towards ‘designer babies’ where the
baby is regarded as a product to be fashioned to the tailored demands of parents,
dramatically altering the parent–child role.
The attitudes and judgements surrounding parenting and the family will be deeply
embedded in rich and interlocking social, cultural, religious, and personal meanings.
Suppose that the child turns out looking different to either parent, as often happens?
Will this be a disappointment with a ‘product’? There is also a complex background
to who has access to what knowledge. Clinics offering this service at the time of
writing are based in Spain, which has strict donor anonymity laws, meaning that a
gamete donor’s anonymity will be protected. The child may know that he or she has
been donor conceived but not who their genetic mother or father was. Unless of
course, sleuthing through DNA ancestry results later produces this information, as is
increasingly often the case. Thus, we can see that the knowledge produced by facial
recognition AI enters a whirlpool of epistemic complexity where feelings are likely
to be heated, confusing, and where different parties may have very different
opinions.
Exercise 23
Try to analyse the different considerations that might be brought to bear upon
assessing the merits of this AI technology within this context, noting the issues on
which further research is needed and the areas of greatest controversy and
complexity.
One can perfectly comprehend a parent of a child conceived with a donor egg
wishing to avoid comments by strangers in the playground about how different the
child looks to the parent. It’s literally none of the stranger’s business. One of the
issues here is one raised repeatedly by AI: that information may be not yours to have;

and it may be not yours to give. This is not just an issue raised by the gathering of
data and access to it but also by the possibilities of analysis of data that one might
have obtained legitimately. However, our ideas about making moral judgements
about envisaging our future lives and relationships have been formed in contexts of
uncertainties and with notions about what information is mine, what is yours, and not
only how much might be shared but also how it might be shared.
11.5
Machines as Moral Agents: Could Artiﬁcial Intelligence Enhance. . .
493
The possibilities of surveillance and the myriad social, ethical, and legal quan-
daries that these produce are well known, but it’s important to note that this then can
be seen as a manifestation of the difﬁculties in considering that AI can help us to
become better morally by furnishing us with more and more data collected via more
and more lines of sight. We can also see that the requirements of transparency and
explainability, which are so important in relation to understanding the operation of
discrete parts of AI, do not generalise to knowledge as a whole. A wry smile and a
change of subject is a perfectly apt response to the stranger in the playground.
11.5.8
AI, Information, Ethics, and How We Communicate
In addition to nuanced judgements about how information is gathered and the quality
and nature of the relationships that this reveals, the manner in which information is
communicated may also be critical and need ﬁne-tuned judgements. We have
previously noted that factual knowledge, knowledge-by-description, gives only a
partial account of the varieties of knowledge; we will need more than a bare account
of descriptive knowledge, of information which can be formally expressed in code or
mathematics or in plain language, to convey the messages and interplay of human
connection often needed in human relationships. Information may be communicated
implicitly, by actions, and imperfect and incomplete communication may serve a
particular purpose better.
A favourite example of mine is taken from the children’s classic, The Railway
Children by E. Nesbitt. The father of the family is in prison on false charges of
espionage, a fact that the mother has hidden from her three children. The eldest girl,
Roberta (Bobbie), who is on the cusp of adulthood, plays a liminal role including in
keeping the younger children from discovering that anything at all is awry, realising
herself that something is wrong, yet respecting her mother’s right of secrecy:
. . . she had the power of silent sympathy. That sounds rather dull, I know, but it’s not so dull
as it sounds. It just means that a person is able to know that you are unhappy, and to love you
extra on that account, without bothering you by telling you all the time how sorry she is for
you. That was what Bobbie was like. She knew that Mother was unhappy—and that Mother
had not told her the reason. So she just loved Mother more and never said a single word that
could let Mother know how earnestly her little girl wondered what Mother was unhappy
about. This needs practice. It is not so easy as you might think [51, Ch. IV].
It is crystal clear here that AI, or even simply hacking into her mother’s emails,
would wreck the situation which Bobbie handles with grace and wisdom.

Our Future with AI: Future Projections and Moral Machines
We considered above the requirement of moral language and moral communica-
tion (see Sect. 11.5.3). It may be that not all of our moral judgements, our moral
wisdom, may ﬁnd precise expression in language, nor may they need this. The
driving assumption behind much hope for the use of AI, of improvements in clarity,
speed, efﬁciency, and universality, may be far too crude to capture the nuances of
human respect for the necessary distance and privacy, which forms an essential part
of the complex relationships between people. Speed is sometimes necessary and
sometimes gets in the way; attention to timing, careful waiting, and watching can be
essential. Clarity is sometimes needed; sometimes, it is not needed, and sometimes
the steps necessary to achieve clarity may disrupt the delicate relationships and
differences in position that make up the warp and weft of our moral lives.
Let us end this book here, contemplating the difﬁculties and delights of
attempting to live according to the best values we can. We have been able to indicate
only a very partial view of the complex question of how AI might help us morally, of
what our moral weaknesses and strengths are. This indeed is a question which
undergirds the entire project, and which we face day to day as we use the complex
and varied technology which is so interwoven into our lives. In writing this book, I
have been painfully aware of what is left out and have been forced to simplify at
every turn. Everything else is up to you.
11.6
Key Points
Projected visions of the far future may be based upon an implied purpose in the
universe that projects an assumption of progress, whereas other accounts ﬁrmly
reject the notion that there is any purpose or value inherent in the universe other than
values set by humans.
Both approaches can be seen to have roots in Western value systems, with some
Biblical antecedents and the inﬂuence of the Enlightenment often in a mixed pattern.
A common thread may be a special role for humans. By understanding such
inﬂuences, comparisons and dialogue with those from other traditions may be
enhanced.
Accounts of imagined human enhancement, whether using technology or not,
have to be based upon a value base in order to support the claim that changes amount
to enhancement. If radical changes are proposed, this may make it hard or impossible
to judge whether such enhancement would count as a moral good for current
humanity.
The issue of whether machines could exhibit morality in any way is highly
complex, resting both upon accounts of the current and imagined future capabilities
of AI but also on views of the nature of ethics and of the basis of moral judgements
and actions.
Thinking through this issue can be a way of tackling many of the issues around AI
ethics that we met earlier in the book.

11.7
Educator Notes
495
The possibilities for AI to assist us as a moral adviser look strongest in the case of
providing knowledge relevant to ethical judgement, but even here, there are consid-
erable complexities. We are left with difﬁcult questions about the relevance of moral
knowledge and the kind of knowledge and information that we need for moral
judgements.
11.7
Educator Notes
As the ﬁnal chapter, this consolidates a great deal of past material. The exercises
generally expect much of students in terms of drawing on previous work and
rehearsing and extending their understanding. Each of the exercises, as before,
could simply be read through for brief reﬂection, but many could involve consider-
able work if students looked into them thoroughly; they can still be useful if engaged
with at different levels of depth.
Students may ﬁnd that in working through the exercises in this chapter, they
conﬁrm views from previous exercises, or they may ﬁnd that they have altered their
perspective in some ways. Either is good, but in either case, students should take this
opportunity to reﬂect back on their previous work.
The two main topics can of course be treated entirely separately. The material in
Sect. 11.3 which follows from Sect. 11.2 naturally draws upon Sect. 10.4 and an
overview of this section would be very desirable as a prerequisite.
Debate and extended project or essay topics The general topic of Sect. 11.3,
together with the individual exercises, could make a good class debate, or extended
project or essay, since it attempts to capture two appealing approaches to AI ethics
that overlap to an extent but also conﬂict considerably. This topic also raises the very
general issue of how very basic elements of one’s worldview impact one’s approach
to AI ethics and leads naturally into discussion of different cultural and religious
attitudes.
The general issue of building some kind of ‘moral machine’ could be a good
whole class or group project, with different small groups assigned to address
different elements of this complex question.
Exercise 23 is particularly challenging, given that it addresses the embedding of
AI within a complex and emotive area. It could thus form a basis for extended work,
especially for students who would beneﬁt from being pushed. There is earlier
material, for example, in Chap. 4, concerning genomic and genetic information
which students could draw upon, and it could also provide an exercise in what
further material and considerations need to be gathered.

Glossary
Abduction In reasoning, to proceed from a set of observations to the most likely
conclusion, even if the information is incomplete.
Accountability To be held accountable is to have responsibility to explain, justify,
and/or rectify one’s actions and decisions.
Agent neutrality Roughly, a moral theory is agent neutral if it does not matter who
performs a particular action or brings about a certain outcome; moral reasoning is
agent neutral if the reasoning applies to all agents equally.
Agent relativity A moral theory is agent relative if the identity of the agent
performing an action or faced with a particular set of moral requirements is at
least sometimes relevant.
Alchemy Medical practice dedicated to the attempt to turn base metals into gold;
general term used to indicate the attempt to greatly transmute the nature of
anything.

primate history of hierarchical groups, relating to leadership, respect for authority
and traditions.
Autonomy Literally, self-rule. In ethics, the capacity to govern one’s own life.
Autonomy, machine The capacity of machines to behave without direct or imme-
diate human supervision.
Autonomy, relational In ethics, an approach to autonomy which also stresses the
importance of human connectedness and the need for this in order for autonomy
to develop and ﬂourish.
Behaviourism, methodological A methodological approach in psychology which
studies the mind through studying behaviour, often treating the mind as a kind of
black box, with input and output as stimulus and response.
Behaviourism, philosophical The philosophical approach to mind and body, that
proposes that the mind can be understood in terms of outward behaviour,
including language.
Beneﬁcence The aim to produce good for another person or persons.

Extended mind theory A group of philosophical theories concerning the nature of
the mind which considers that cognition may not be understood purely as
occurring ‘inside our heads’ but may essentially or contingently involve the
external world.
Fact–value distinction The philosophical claim that statements concerning facts
about the world are entirely distinct from statements about value; that value is not
to be found ‘in the world’.
Fairness There are various different accounts of fairness, but all regard fairness as
