Revision of Drive Theory
Several deep revisions of Freud’s theory of the drives are proposed: 
(1) Drives are conscious and are in fact the source of all consciousness. 
(2) Drive energy is equated with variational free energy and is therefore 
quantifiable in principle. (3) There are not two drives but many, seven of 
which may be described as “emotional” as opposed to “bodily” drives. 
(4) All drives are self-preservative or preservative of the species; there is 
no death drive at work in the mind. This means, at the mechanistic level, 
that all drives are homeostatic and anti-entropic. (5) The great task of 
mental development is to supplement instinctual predictions about how 
our multiple drive demands may be met and reconciled with each other. 
This work is done by learning from experience, mainly through voluntary 
behavior, which is governed by conscious feelings.

sychoanalytic drive theory is in need of fundamental revision. 
Many analysts today have not only lost confidence in Freud’s clas-
sical conception of the drives (1915a, 1920) but have abandoned drive 
theory altogether, thereby conflating Freudian drive theory with drive 
theory per se. The price we pay for this is too great; rather than abandon 
drive theory, we must revise it.
The raison d’être of psychoanalysis was in Freud’s view to bring the 
phenomena of mental life within the purview of science; to treat the mind 
as just another part of nature. His pioneering efforts to that end were pred-
icated on the assumption that we human beings are, after all, a species of

animal. In this sense, Freud is rightly described as a “biologist of the 
mind” (Sulloway 1979).
If the mind is part of nature, then it is embodied (what else can it be?); 
and it is from this simple premise that Freudian drive theory starts. Human 
mental functions, like those of all other species, ultimately serve the evo-
lutionary imperatives of survival and reproductive success. This approach 
enabled Freud to see the obvious, shocking though it may have been to his 
Victorian contemporaries: the sexual drive plays the same fundamental 
role in human psychology that it does in animal behavior. To abandon 
drive theory is to abandon this insight, which is the essential connection 
between psychoanalysis and the body, and, indeed, with the life sciences 
as a whole.
Freud’s classical definition of drive (1915a) is so well known that it 
hardly needs quoting1:
“Drive” appears to us as a concept on the frontier between the mental and the 
somatic, as the psychical representative of the stimuli originating from within 
the organism and reaching the mind, as a measure of the demand made upon the 
mind for work in consequence of its connection with the body [1915a,  
pp. 121–122].
All the introductory points I have just made about the embodied nature of 
mind are illustrated in this definition, but it reveals something else, too. 
The phrase “a measure of the demand made upon the mind for work” is 
also a psychophysical statement, which alludes to Freud’s first ambition, 
namely to “furnish a psychology that shall be a natural science: that is, to 
represent psychical processes as quantitatively determinate states of spec-
ifiable material particles, thus making those processes perspicuous and 
free from contradiction” (Freud 1895, p. 295). Although Freud gave up 
his attempt to represent mental processes as material ones, he never aban-
doned the deeper scientific goals on which this endeavor was based. 
Those goals are encapsulated in another quotation that again is so well 
known that it barely needs repeating. I am referring to the goals of the 
“Helmholtz school of medicine,” of which Freud’s revered teacher Ernst 
 1In line with the editorial policy followed in the Revised Standard Edition, I am through-
out this paper replacing Strachey’s translation of Trieb as “instinct” with “drive.” However, my 
quotations are referenced to the pagination of the original Standard Edition, since the revised 
edition is still in press.

von Brücke was a founding member.2 The mission of the Helmholtz 
school was described as follows by Emil du Bois–Reymond, another 
founding member, in 1842:
Brücke and I pledged a solemn oath to put into effect this truth: “No other forces 
than the common physical and chemical ones are active within the organism. In 
those cases which cannot currently be explained by these forces one has either 
to find the specific way or form of their action by means of the physical- 
mathematical method or to assume new forces equal in dignity to the chemical-
physical forces inherent in matter, reducible to the forces of attraction and repul-
sion” [Du Bois–Reymond 1842, p. 108].
This goal became the impetus behind Freud’s fundamental theory of 
psychoanalysis, his “metapsychology,” which, as he explained at the 
time, was intended to replace metaphysics (i.e., to rescue psychology 
from philosophy and claim it for science).3 This is important, because 
Freud’s metapsychology has suffered much the same fate as his drive 
theory. That is, many psychoanalysts today, by abandoning Freudian 
metapsychology, have abandoned any attempt to cast the structure and 
functions of the mind in lawful, mechanistic terms (cf. Holt 1967; Gill 
and Holzman 1976; Klein 1976; Schafer 1976). Again, in my view, the 
price we pay for this is too great. There can be little doubt that Freud 
would have deemed it a tragedy.
The aspect of Freud’s metapsychology that has been most roundly 
rejected is precisely the part that overlaps with his drive theory, namely, 
what he called the “economic point of view.” This is the quantitative 
viewpoint mentioned both in the opening sentence of the 1895 Project, 
quoted above, and in Du Bois–Reymond’s solemn oath. It is alluded to 
also in Freud’s definition of drive as a measure of the demand for mental 
work. Although, as I have said, Freud abandoned “for the present” (1915b, 
p. 175; emphasis in original) his attempt to translate psychodynamics into 
neurophysiology (see Freud 1920, p. 60), he never abandoned his deeper 
 2In his Autobiographical Study, Freud (1925) wrote: “In Ernst Brücke’s physiological 
laboratory, I found rest and full satisfaction—and men, too, whom I could respect and take as 
my models: the great Brücke himself, and his assistants” (p. 10). In a postscript to “The 
Question of Lay Analysis,” Freud (1927) added that Brücke “carried more weight with me than 
anyone else in my whole life” (p. 253).
 3When Freud first introduced this term, he clarified that it refers to a level of explanation 
that incorporates both psychological and biological facts (letter to Fliess. March 10, 1898 
[Masson 1985]).

assumption that the mind, like everything else in nature, must be driven 
by an energy of some kind. Thus, he clung to his notion of “drive energy”; 
a psychical energy that was capable of increase, diminution, displace-
ment, and discharge, and therefore possessed all the characteristics of a 
quantity, “though we have no means of measuring it” (Freud 1894, p. 60). 
This is the most direct example of Freud’s commitment to the ideals of 
the Helmholtz school: in cases that cannot yet be explained in terms of 
physical and chemical forces, one has “either to find the specific way or 
form of their action by means of the physical-mathematical method or to 
assume new forces equal in dignity.”
I have gained the impression, over decades of work in this field, not 
only that most psychoanalysts have rejected the notion of “drive energy” 
and the associated “economic point of view” but that many of us are posi-
tively embarrassed by these concepts. Let me be clear: what is at stake 
here is not only whether psychoanalytic theory is compatible with the 
basic tenets of physical science (whereby nothing can perform work with-
out using an energy to do so), but also whether we are unwittingly consign-
ing ourselves to mind/body dualism (whereby the mind exists somehow 
independently of the physical universe).4 A far better approach, in my 
view, is to do what Freud expected his intellectual descendants to do, 
which is what we do in every other science: revise and correct his basic 
concepts in line with unfolding evidence. That is my purpose here.
Since this paper carries over into psychoanalysis assumptions derived 
from other branches of knowledge, I must briefly, before proceeding, 
address the often expressed objection that it is unpsychoanalytic or even 
antipsychoanalytic to do so (see, e.g., Blass and Carmeli 2007). When it 
comes to drive theory, this objection is more easily dismissed than in 
other such matters, for the reason that Freud always acknowledged in the 
 4For Freud (1915a, pp. 121–122), as quoted above, drive was a concept “on the frontier 
between the mental and the somatic”; it was the foundation stone of his monism. This is not the 
place to enter into lengthy philosophical discussions; however, to avoid misunderstanding, let 
me clarify that metapsychological constructs (like “drive”) are functional entities that manifest 
in both psychological and physiological phenomena (e.g., feeling states and their correlated 
neurochemical events). Like Freud, I take the position of dual-aspect monism: psychological 
events are no more caused by physiological ones than thunder is caused by lightning. Our goal, 
therefore, is not to reduce psychological phenomena to physiological ones, but rather to explain 
their common underlying mechanism in natural-scientific terms. This requires us to transcend 
the languages of psychology and physiology both, and to replace them with the deeper (nonphe-
nomenal) abstractions of statistical physics. As Galileo said: “The book of Nature is written in 
the language of mathematics.”

case of the “frontier” concept of drive that we are obliged to rely on 
knowledge from other fields:
I am altogether doubtful whether any decisive pointers for the differentiation and 
classification of the drives can be arrived at on the basis of working over the 
psychological material. This working-over seems rather itself to call for the 
application to the material of definite assumptions concerning the life of the drives, 
and it would be a desirable thing if those assumptions could be taken from some 
other branch of knowledge and carried over to psychology [Freud 1915a, p. 124].
Many other such statements could be cited. It is abundantly clear 
from Freud’s writings on this topic that he drew heavily on the biology 
and psychophysics of his day. That is why he felt so uncertain about his 
conclusions—“it should be made quite clear that the uncertainty of our 
speculation has been greatly increased by the necessity for borrowing 
from the science of biology”—and why he readily conceded that future 
biological findings “may be of a kind that will blow away the whole of 
our artificial structure of hypotheses” (Freud 1920, p. 60). In short, in the 
case of drive theory, there can be no doubt that we may, indeed must, 
carry over into psychoanalysis findings derived from other branches of 
knowledge.
I. A Brief Review of Classical Drive Theory
Freud’s drive theory, well known to psychoanalysts, does not require 
detailed exegesis here. I will briefly outline only the major issues that 
seem to need revision: (1) the fundamental mechanism of drive; (2) the 
bodily sources of drive; (3) classification of the drives; (4) the relation-
ship between drive and pleasure-unpleasure; and (5) the relationship 
between drive and conscious qualities in general. Since these points are 
discussed so frequently in Freud’s writings, I am not going to clutter my 
summary with detailed bibliographic references, though I will employ 
quotation marks wherever I use Freud’s own words. These are words he 
used many times; I will make referenced quotations only in relation to 
some specific and less familiar issues.
(1) The Fundamental Mechanism of Drive
Freud believed, from the first to the last of his writings, that the fun-
damental mechanism of drive was to discharge as rapidly as possible the 

Ma r k So lms
1038
excitations that impinge upon the mind from the interior of the body.5 The 
purpose of such discharge was to keep the level of the relentless somatic 
sources of excitation as low as possible. Freud linked this discharge 
mechanism of drive with the psychophysical notion of a “freely mobile” 
energy—the driving force of his “primary process” of mental functioning. 
His abiding model for this mechanism was that of the reflex arc. In his 
earliest writings he formulated it as a “principle of neuronal inertia,” that 
is, as the reflexive tendency of nerve cells to divest themselves of excita-
tion. In his last writings, he formulated it in terms of the “Nirvana prin-
ciple,” that is, the striving of the nervous system to rid itself of excitation 
as quickly as possible and thereby return to the quiescent state—and ulti-
mately to an inert, inorganic state. In a word, for Freud, drives were entro-
pic. That is, drives (in his first [1915a] theory, but the “death drive” only 
in his second [1920] theory; see below)6 were governed by the Second 
Law of Thermodynamics, according to which the energy in every system 
naturally dissipates. In this connection, it is evident that Freud’s distinc-
tion between “free” and “bound” states of drive energy built directly upon 
the physics of Helmholtz, who introduced the term “bound energy” into 
thermodynamics and indeed played a major role in the formulation of its 
First Law.7 It is also important to note in this connection that Freud’s 
“constancy principle,” in terms of which the mental apparatus tolerates a 
tonic store of energy, which is kept as constant (and low) as possible, and 
which becomes its supply of “bound energy” (and thereby of the second-
ary process), is a compromise between the primary process of mental 
functioning and the “exigencies of life” (which later became the “reality 
principle”). Freud’s constancy principle was not a manifestation of the 
 5A final word on philosophical premises: “the mind” is merely a subjective observational 
perspective upon “the body”; it is the being of the body. The scientific question arising from this 
premise is: why does it feel like something to be a human body but not to be, say, a computer? 
In other words, what does sentient subjectivity do and how does it arise? The answer to this 
question, as we shall see, has everything to do with the biological function of feeling. Please 
note: my account of the mechanisms through which feeling comes about is not intended to be 
metaphorical. These are the actual, causal mechanisms of sentient subjectivity. (For the fuller 
treatment that this immensely complex issue requires, see Solms [2021]. My topic here is 
Freudian drive theory, not the mechanistic origins of selfhood.)
 6In Freud’s second drive theory, the fundamental entropic tendency of drive is represented 
in the life drives, too, by way of their “conservative” nature; that is, through their compulsive 
tendency to revert to a previous state of things (previous to the impingement of an excitation). 
See the “compulsion to repeat.”
 7“In my opinion this distinction [between free and bound drive energy] represents the 
deepest insight we have gained up to the present into the nature of nervous energy, and I do not 
see how we can avoid making it” (Freud 1915b, p. 188).

basic tendency of drives themselves, which remained an unrelenting ten-
dency toward discharge.
(2) The Bodily Sources of Drive
Freud distinguished between the “pressure,” “aim,” “object,” and 
“source” of a drive. The “pressure” referred to its quantitative aspect, to 
the fact that it was a “measure” admitting of degrees. The “aim” referred 
to its basic mechanism, discussed above, which was to discharge, that is, 
to get rid of the demand. The human infant, like all animals, is equipped 
with reflexes and instincts8 that serve this purpose, but since these innate 
mechanisms cannot by themselves satisfy the exigencies of life, at least 
not in every context, they must be supplemented by learning—through 
“experiences of satisfaction.” This applies all the more to the “object” of 
a drive, which, as Freud pointed out, is its most variable aspect; the object 
of a drive is almost always specified through learning.
The “source” of every drive, even of the death drive, is the “cellular 
processes of the body.” (Freud equated the life and death drives with anab-
olism and catabolism, respectively.) In regard to the life drives and their 
sources, he placed special emphasis on mechanical stimulation of the skin 
and other sensory organs, and in particular of the mucous membranes. 
This applied not only to the libidinal drives but also to the self-preservative 
ones, in his first drive theory. For example, he imagined that irritation of 
the lining of the stomach and dryness of the pharynx gave rise to the drives 
of hunger and thirst, respectively. Such stimulation, according to Freud, 
resulted in the release of “chemical products,”9 including specifically sex-
ual ones. He took the view (which he called “a provisional assumption that 
we cannot escape in the theory of the drives”) that “excitations of two 
kinds arise from the somatic organs, based upon differences of a chemical 
nature. One of these kinds of excitation we describe as being specifically 
sexual, and we speak of the organ concerned as the ‘erotogenic zone’ of 
the sexual component drive arising from it” (Freud 1905, p. 168).
 8The fact that instincts satisfy drive demands demonstrates just how unfortunate it was that 
Strachey translated Trieb as “instinct.” The German word for instinct is Instinkt (see Solms 
2018b).
 9Interestingly, Freud predicted on this basis that it might become possible in the future 
(our present) to exert a “direct influence” on the drive economy by means of psychopharmaceu-
ticals. In this connection, Freud likened mental illnesses to “toxic processes,” and he emphasised 
the similarities between the neuroses and Graves’ disease (hyperthyroidism) and Bright’s dis-
ease (acute or chronic nephritis). Significantly, in this respect he also drew attention to the 
libidinal intoxication that is caused by ingestion of alkaloids like cocaine, something about 
which he knew much from personal experience.

Thus, for example, sucking at the breast simultaneously satisfies the 
self-preservative drive of hunger and (the oral component of) the libidinal 
drive “anaclitically.” That is, the libidinal function leans upon the nutri-
tional function.10 The same applies to defecation, in the case of the anal 
component drive, which provides libidinal satisfaction while simultane-
ously meeting a self-preservative need. According to Freud, it is only in 
the process of development, and therefore through learning, that the com-
ponent libidinal drives detach themselves—and then only partially—from 
these self-preservative functions (later called “narcissistic”). In this way, 
said Freud, the libidinal component drives mature and coalesce to achieve 
“genital” sexuality, in service of the biological function of reproduction. 
This developmental ideal is, however, not always attained, in which case 
the component drives are said to be “fixated” on pregenital aims and 
objects.
(3) Classification of the Drives
Freud freely admitted that he found his classification of the drives to 
be problematic. It was especially in this respect that he thought “it would 
be a desirable thing if those assumptions could be taken from some other 
branch of knowledge and carried over to psychology.” However, in the 
absence of definite guidance from the biology of his time, he felt obliged 
to formulate some provisional hypotheses.
For some reason (perhaps the injunction to “assume new forces equal 
in dignity to the chemical-physical forces inherent in matter, reducible to 
the forces of attraction and repulsion”), Freud considered it necessary to 
classify the drives on a dualistic basis.11 Clinical experience demanded a 
classification that could accommodate the ubiquity of conflict in mental 
life, but it seems obvious that this requirement does not necessarily imply 
a two-way conflict (e.g., one can be sexually aroused by an object, and 
annoyed by it, and dependent upon it (i.e., “attached” to it), all at the same 
time).12 Be that as it may, Freud initially drew a dichotomy between the 
“self-preservative” and “libidinal” drives, and he linked this with the 
10Anlehnung, which Strachey translated as “anaclisis,” literally means “leaning-on-ness” 
(see Solms 2018b).
11“The analogy of our two basic drives extends from the sphere of living things to the pair 
of opposing forces—attraction and repulsion—which rule in the inorganic world” (Freud 1940, 
p. 149).
12Later we shall learn that these inclinations are manifestations of three different drives.

contrasting needs of the individual and the species. However, with his 
development of the concept of narcissism (self-love), he recognized that 
self-preservation was itself libidinally driven, and he therefore felt obliged 
to combine the libido with self-preservation under the rubric of what he 
now called the “life drives” (or “Eros”). This led him to postulate a new 
and deeper principle “beyond the pleasure principle” (see section [4] 
below), which he called the “Nirvana principle.” This principle was the 
direct expression of entropy, that is, of the natural tendency to dissipate, 
which all living things must oppose if they are to maintain their existence. 
This fundamental entropic tendency was counteracted by the life drives, 
the aim of which was “to establish ever greater unities and to preserve 
them.”
The conflicting demands of the constructive and destructive drives 
were said to operate throughout the organism, through processes of 
“fusion” and “de-fusion.” Thus, for example, self-preservative aggression 
(and indeed, motility in general) was conceptualized by Freud not as a 
primary disposition but rather as the product of a fusion between libido 
and the death drive, which is thereby diverted away from the subject and 
toward objects. The function of the self-preservative drives in general 
thereby became a deflection of external threats away from the organism: 
“to assure that the organism shall follow its own path to death, and to 
ward off any possible ways of returning to inorganic existence other than 
those which are immanent in the organism itself” (Freud 1920, p. 39).
In biological functions the two basic drives operate against each other or com-
bine with each other. Thus, the act of eating is a destruction of the object with 
the final aim of incorporating it, and the sexual act is an act of aggression with 
the purpose of the most intimate union. This concurrent and mutually opposing 
action of the two basic drives gives rise to the whole variegation of the phenom-
ena of life [Freud 1940, p. 149].
On this basis, Freud reconceptualized the development of the sexual 
function—from oral “cannibalism,” through anal-sadistic control and 
phallic superiority, to mature genital love—as the product of progres-
sively more successful fusions between destructiveness and libido (i.e., 
progressive taming of our ambivalence toward objects). Falling ill was 
now conceptualized as a regression of this progress—that is, as drive 
de-fusion.

Ma r k So lms
1042
The extent to which Freud was obliged to speculate about the physi-
ology of the drives is evident from the fact that he thought epileptic sei-
zures might be a clinical expression of drive de-fusion. The same applied 
to his speculations about “germ plasm,” which were formulated before 
the discovery of DNA. The following quotation illustrates the limitations 
of the biological knowledge then available:
The id, guided by the pleasure principle—that is, by the perception of unplea-
sure—fends off [the life drives] in various ways. It does so in the first place by 
complying as swiftly as possible with the demands of the non-desexualized 
libido—by striving for the satisfaction of the directly sexual trends. But it does 
so in a far more comprehensive fashion in relation to one particular form of 
satisfaction in which all component demands converge—by discharge of the 
sexual substances, which are saturated vehicles, so to speak, of the erotic ten-
sions.13 The ejection of the sexual substances in the sexual act corresponds in a 
sense to the separation of soma and germ-plasm. This accounts for the likeness 
of the condition that follows complete sexual satisfaction to dying, and for the 
fact that death coincides with the act of copulation in some lower animals. These 
creatures die in the act of reproduction because, after Eros has been eliminated 
through the process of satisfaction, the death drive has a free hand for accom-
plishing its purposes [Freud 1923, p. 47].
(4) The Relationship between Drive and Pleasure-Unpleasure
This is trenched upon by the opening sentence of the above quota-
tion. As is well known, Freud initially postulated a direct psychophysical 
ratio between increasing and decreasing drive tension on the one hand 
and unpleasure and pleasure on the other. (Incidentally, it is curiously 
unclear whether this applied only to the libidinal drive. It seems that 
Freud conceptualized the affective valencing of self-preservative needs in 
terms of “anaclisis”; see section [2] above. However, the question fell 
away when self-preservation was understood as an expression of self-
love.) This conception of drive pressure in relation to pleasure-unpleasure 
makes intuitive sense, and it accordingly became the foundation of the 
“pleasure principle,” in terms of which animals like us are attracted to 
pleasurable aims and objects and repelled by unpleasurable ones. (Notice, 
once more, the attraction-repulsion polarity.) It will become important 
13See section (2) above: Freud (1905, p. 213) imagined that the “the accumulation of the 
sexual substances creates and maintains sexual tension; the pressure of these products upon the 
walls of the vesicles containing them might be supposed to act as a stimulus upon a spinal cen-
tre, the condition of which would then be perceived by higher centres and would give rise in 
consciousness of the familiar sensation of tension.”

REVISION OF DRIVE THEORY

later to notice that Freud saw the pleasure-unpleasure series as a contin-
uum: the organism is compelled to seek ever more pleasure. It is only due 
to the constraining influence of the “reality principle” that this compul-
sive urge is tamed, as the ego learns to tolerate a constant store of libidinal 
energy, which characterizes the constancy principle and gives rise to the 
secondary process.
Freud soon was beset by doubts concerning this directly proportional 
ratio between drive pressure and affective valence. His canonical counter-
example was the problem of foreplay (which he explained by the theory 
of pregenital modes of satisfaction), but, more generally, it was the prob-
lem that sexual excitement itself, presumably characterized by increasing 
libidinal pressure, is typically experienced as pleasurable. Freud was 
never able to resolve this fundamental issue; he could ultimately do no 
better than to suggest that perhaps pleasure and unpleasure correspond 
not to the absolute level of drive tension but rather to fluctuations in it 
over a given period of time. (He equated this with amplitude.) The fol-
lowing quotation from Beyond the Pleasure Principle illustrates the 
extent of the problem, and it also introduces another one:
Here might be the starting point for fresh investigations. Our consciousness 
communicates to us feelings from within not only of pleasure and unpleasure but 
also a peculiar tension which in its turn can be either pleasurable or unpleasur-
able. Should the difference between these feelings enable us to distinguish 
between bound and unbound processes of energy? or is the feeling of tension to 
be related to the absolute magnitude of the cathexis within a given unit of time? 
Another striking fact is that the life drives have so much more contact with our 
internal perception—emerging as breakers of the peace and constantly produc-
ing tensions whose release is felt as pleasure—while the death drives seem to do 
their work unobtrusively. The pleasure principle seems actually to serve the 
death drives [Freud 1920, p. 63.]
The new problem emerges with the closing sentence. In the Project, 
Freud had initially equated the pleasure principle with neuronal inertia; 
its relationship with entropy became even more clear when he equated it, 
as he did here, with the Nirvana principle. But since the Nirvana principle 
was served by the death drive, this had the dismaying implication that 
pleasure was associated with satisfaction not of the life drives but of the 
death drive. That is why Freud ultimately felt obliged, as we saw in the 
previous section, to construe the pleasure associated with orgasm—a phe-
nomenon so closely connected with reproduction (from the biological 

Ma r k So lms
1044
standpoint) that it surely serves the purposes of life—as a deathly event. 
This is a clear indication that Freud might have taken a wrong turn, some-
where, in developing his theory of the drives.
Before moving to the relationship between drive and conscious quali-
ties in general, there is one last issue concerning its relationship with 
pleasure-unpleasure that must be addressed. Affect, for Freud, is not 
reducible to “oscillations in the tension of drive needs” alone; it is more 
complex than that. Here is his fullest definition of it:
What is an affect in the dynamic sense? It is in any case something highly com-
posite. An affect includes in the first place particular motor innervations or dis-
charges and secondly certain feelings; the latter are of two kinds—perceptions 
of the motor actions that have occurred and the direct feelings of pleasure and 
unpleasure which, as we say, give the affect its keynote. But I do not think that 
with this enumeration we have arrived at the essence of an affect. We seem to 
see deeper in the case of some affects and to recognize that the core which holds 
the combination we have described together is the repetition of some particular 
significant experience. This experience could only be a very early impression of 
a very general nature, placed in the prehistory not of the individual but of the 
species (Freud 1916–1917, p. 395).
So affect, for Freud, included an additional dimension, which he concep-
tualized under the heading “phylogenetic memory.” A pivotal example is 
“castration anxiety,” which he saw as an inherited disposition based not 
solely (and sometimes not at all) in individual experience but rather in 
prehistoric events: the repeated experience by our ancestors, over many 
generations, of an alpha male in a primal horde who castrates or tries to 
castrate his sons when they reach puberty and threaten his preeminent 
sexual position. According to Freud, the descendants of these sons inherit 
unconscious memories of those traumatic events, which take the form of 
what he called “primal fantasies,” which form the nucleus of the system 
Ucs. It is precisely in relation to these inherited dispositions that Freud 
used the word “instinct” (Instinkt) rather than “drive” (Trieb). Having 
drawn attention to this aspect of affect, I will discuss it no further, pre-
cisely because it is not the expression of a drive. I will defer discussion of 
this matter to a companion paper titled “Revision of the Theory of the 
Biological Origins of the Oedipus Complex” (Solms in press).
(5) The Relationship between Drive and Conscious Qualities in General
Although Freud (1894) first introduced a quantitative factor into 
mental life with reference to “quotas of affect” that cathect memory traces 

REVISION OF DRIVE THEORY

of ideas, just one year later (1895) he had already adopted a different 
view: drive energies—now called “Qη”—were in the first instance 
unconscious; they become conscious only when they reach the “upper 
story” of the mental apparatus, the cortical system “ω” (his later system 
Cs.). Freud held to this view for the remainder of his scientific life; not 
only to the view that drive energies were unconscious in themselves but 
also that consciousness was an exclusive property of the cortex:
The process of something becoming conscious is above all linked with the per-
ceptions which our sense organs receive from the external world. From the 
topographical point of view, therefore, it is a phenomenon which takes place in 
the outermost cortex of the ego. It is true that we also receive information from 
the inside of the body—the feelings, which actually exercise a more peremptory 
influence on our mental life than external perceptions; moreover, in certain cir-
cumstances the sense organs themselves transmit feelings, sensations of pain, in 
addition to the perceptions specific to them. Since, however, these sensations (as 
we call them in contrast to conscious perceptions) also emanate from the termi-
nal organs and since we regard all these as prolongations or offshoots of the 
cortical layer, we are still able to maintain the assertion made above. The only 
distinction would be that, as regards the terminal organs of sensation and feeling, 
the body itself would take the place of the external world [Freud 1940,  
pp. 161–162; emphasis added].
The distinction between unconscious drive energies and conscious 
perceptions of them must not be conflated with Freud’s notion of drive as 
“a concept on the frontier between the mental and the somatic.” For 
Freud, drive energies operating within the mind (in the id and in the 
unconscious parts of the ego and the superego) were unconscious in all 
their vicissitudes until they reached the superficial system Cs. Crucially, 
this was how he made sense of the fact that drive demands emanating 
from one source can become “confluent” with those from another source; 
so that, for example, sexual longing can be transformed into hunger. This 
also explains how unconscious drive demands can be misconstrued by 
consciousness, through processes like condensation, displacement, rever-
sal of affect, and the like, as occur in the dreamwork and in defense.
The same theoretical claim, namely, that drive energies are uncon-
scious in themselves, explains why Freud insisted that affects are neces-
sarily conscious phenomena. There is no such thing as an “unconscious 
emotion.” This is because affects, for Freud, were perceptions of the pro-
cess whereby drives are discharged, so that a drive remains unconscious 

Ma r k So lms
1046
until it is discharged, at which point it is consciously perceived and is no 
longer a drive but an affect.14
Freud saw consciousness, in both its manifestations—endogenous 
affect and exogenous representation—as a perceptual process, whereby 
stimuli impinging upon a terminal organ (whether it be visceral or sen-
sory) are propagated in quantitative form to the cerebral cortex, which is 
where they are registered as “qualities.” (Accordingly, from 1917 onward, 
Freud combined the interoceptive system Cs. with the exteroceptive Pcpt. 
into a single system Pcpt.-Cs., which perceives affects on its internal sur-
face and objects on its external one.) Where, then, do the differences in 
our conscious qualities—both affective and perceptual—spring from? 
Freud’s answer was:
Everything points to the sense organs, whose qualities seem to be represented 
precisely by different periods [i.e., amplitudes] of neuronal motion. The sense 
organs act not only as Q-screens, like all nerve-ending apparatuses, but also as 
sieves; for they allow the stimulus through from only certain processes with a 
particular period. [Freud 1895, p. 310].
The same applied to the interoceptive terminal organs. Freud’s view 
was:
Are we to suppose that the different drives which originate in the body and oper-
ate on the mind are also to be distinguished by different qualities, and that that 
is why they behave in qualitatively different ways in mental life? This supposi-
tion does not appear to be justified; we are much more likely to find the simpler 
assumption sufficient—that the drives are all qualitatively alike and owe the 
effect they make only to the amount of excitation they carry, or, perhaps, in addi-
tion, to certain functions of that quantity. What distinguishes from one another 
the mental effects produced by the various drives may be traced to the difference 
in their sources [Freud 1915a, p. 123; second emphasis added].
I trust I am not alone in finding this confusing. How can the quantitative 
aspect of different drives (their voltages, as it were) coalesce during the 
passage from the terminal organs through the “lower stories” of the mind 
to the system Pcpt.-Cs., while their differential qualitative aspects (their 
“periods” or amplitudes) remain distinct?
14See Freud (1915b): “Affects and emotions correspond to processes of discharge, the final 
manifestation of which are perceived as feelings. In the present state of our knowledge of affects 
and feelings we cannot express this difference more clearly” (p. 177).

REVISION OF DRIVE THEORY
1047
A bigger problem, however, was this:
The id, cut off from the external world, has a world of perception of its own. It 
detects with extraordinary acuteness certain changes in its interior, especially 
oscillations in the tension of its drive needs, and these changes become con-
scious as feelings in the pleasure–unpleasure series. It is hard to say, to be  
sure, by what means and with the help of what sensory terminal organs these 
perceptions come about. But it is an established fact that self-perceptions— 
coenaesthetic feelings and feelings of pleasure–unpleasure—govern the passage 
of events in the id with despotic force. The id obeys the inexorable pleasure 
principle [Freud 1940, p. 198].
If affects are by definition conscious (see above), then how can it be 
true (1) that the passage of events in the id obeys the inexorable pleasure 
principle and (2) that the id and its drives are unconscious? What is  
the point of a pleasure principle “in” the id if it does not feel it? And if the 
drives are felt as pleasure and unpleasure only when they reach the percep-
tual superficies of the ego, then the sole way for the pleasure principle to 
govern the passage of events in the id is through top-down control. But that 
is the role of the reality principle. Surely the pleasure principle involves 
bottom-up influence? Once again we are on the brink of theoretical  
incoherence—a good sign that we might have taken a wrong turn.
II. Proposed Revisions
One faces a dilemma when drawing on knowledge from a discipline one’s 
readers are not familiar with. Too much technical detail can make the 
exegesis overwhelming, but too little can render it dogmatic. This applies 
especially to contested issues, which exist in every science, and which are 
bound to be highly specialized issues for the very reason that they repre-
sent the cutting edge of a science. The solution I adopt here is to rely on 
the conclusions (and technical terminology) of the most widely known 
and respected authorities, while acknowledging that not everyone agrees 
with them and that current knowledge is by no means complete. That 
said, few would disagree that the leading neuroscientific theorists on the 
topic of drive, in the current state of the field, are Jaak Panksepp (1998), 
Donald Pfaff (1999, 2005), Antonio Damasio (2010, 2018), and Karl 
Friston (2009, 2013). I will draw also on the work of Bjorn Merker (2007), 
though he is less well known. These five scientists represent diverse 

Ma r k So lms
1048
methodologies, ranging from deep brain stimulation to computational 
modeling; they also represent both clinical and experimental methods, in 
both humans and other animals. As in the previous section, I am not going 
to clutter my exegesis with a plethora of references; the grounding refer-
ences just provided will have to suffice. Since I cannot possibly do justice 
to the complexity of the issues within the constraints of a journal article, 
readers wishing to master the underlying science can consult those 
sources. (Alternatively, for a book-length overview of the technical 
issues, see Solms 2021.) I am painfully aware, however, that the account 
I am about to provide might well sound dogmatic, due to its highly con-
densed nature.
I am using letters to designate the sections in this part, rather than 
numbers, as I did in Part I, because the topics do not coincide exactly. It 
is not possible to discuss our current understanding of the fundamental 
mechanism of drive, for example, without simultaneously considering its 
relationship to pleasure-unpleasure. I will cover the following topics: (A) 
the fundamental mechanism of drive and its relationship to pleasure-
unpleasure; (B) the relationship between drive and entropy; (C) classifi-
cation of the drives and the bodily sources of drive; (D) the relationship 
between drive and conscious qualities in general.
(A) The Fundamental Mechanism of Drive and Its Relationship to Pleasure-Unpleasure
The fundamental mechanism of drive is homeostasis. This concept was 
introduced into biology by Walter Cannon (1926), but it became widely 
known only in the 1930s, long after Freud had formulated his basic ideas. 
Cannon’s concept should not be confused with Claude Bernard’s notion of 
a milieu intérieur, which had more in common with Freud’s “constancy 
principle” than with his understanding of the fundamental mechanism of 
drive. Had Freud been familiar with the concept of homeostasis, I believe, 
he would have formulated his drive theory differently, because, at a stroke, 
it solves many of the problems that bedeviled him.
Homeostasis maintains the system that it regulates within “expected” 
bounds. Thus, just as your domestic thermostat drives an engine that 
maintains your desired room temperature, so too the temperature control 
system of your brain works to maintain core body temperature within its 
expected range of 97.7–99.5 degrees Fahrenheit. A crucial difference 
between these two examples, though, is that the expected bounds of your 
body are also its viable bounds. In other words, they are crucial for the 

REVISION OF DRIVE THEORY
1049
survival of your body as a system; unlike your home, when your body 
overshoots or undershoots its expected temperature range by too large a 
measure, it ceases to exist as a system. That is, it dies.
Deviations from the expected ranges function physiologically as 
“error signals” and represent demands for work. However, not all such 
demands can be equated with “drive,” not only for the reason just men-
tioned (viz., that drives are underwritten by a biological scale of values—
that it is good for the system to survive and reproduce—while domestic 
thermostats are not) but also because many such error signals, even in 
biological systems, do not represent demands upon the mind for work. To 
be clear: many homeostatic systems exist (even in the body) that are regu-
lated autonomically. There is nothing mental about them. Blood-pressure 
regulation is a clinically notorious example: you (your mind) knows noth-
ing of your body’s blood-pressure undershoots and overshoots until it is 
too late. Accordingly, unless you monitor your blood pressure artificially 
(externally), you cannot become aware of the error signals and therefore 
can do nothing to correct them. Similarly, your body obtains energy by 
metabolizing glucose from adipose tissues according to need, but no drive 
is involved in that process. The demand upon your mind to find further 
supplies in the outside world, by contrast, is a drive—in exactly the sense 
that Freud (1915a) defined it—in this case, a drive called “hunger.” To 
differentiate these two types of demand for work, the nonmental and the 
mental, I will use the terms “need” and “drive” respectively.
What characterizes the difference between a need and a drive (which 
lie on opposite sides of what Freud described as the “frontier” between 
the somatic and the mental) is well conceptualized by a term derived from 
statistical physics, happily a relatively simple one: “uncertainty.” Blood-
pressure error signals always evoke the same stereotyped response in the 
body (changes in heart rate and vasodilation or vasoconstriction). This is 
because the need to correct aberrant blood pressure is met monotonously, 
by reliable and certain measures, making it a predictable business. The 
mental work demanded by drive is required only when such stereotyped 
algorithms (which predict adequate solutions to error signals with cer-
tainty) are not available. That is when uncertainty prevails.
Here is an example to illustrate what the crossing of the somatic/
mental frontier entails. Respiratory control is normally autonomic: so 
long as the levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide in your blood stay within 
expected viable bounds, you don’t have to be aware of your need to 

Ma r k So lms
1050
breathe. When blood gases exceed these normal limits, however, when 
autonomic mechanisms cannot cope with an emergency situation, respi-
ratory control forcibly intrudes upon consciousness in the form of an 
acute feeling called “air hunger.” This is a drive.15 Unexpected blood gas 
values are an indication that volitional action is required. It is urgently 
necessary to remove an airway obstruction from your throat or to get out 
of a carbon-dioxide-filled room. At this point, the need to breathe enters 
consciousness, via an inner warning system that you experience as 
alarm—specifically, in this case, “suffocation alarm.” Why does it enter 
consciousness? The answer is: because there is no response available that 
predicts with certainty that it will achieve the necessary outcome. The 
adequate solution remains uncertain. In other words, choices must be 
made.
Choices (the defining feature of voluntary as opposed to automatic 
control) must be grounded in a value system, which determines whether 
a selected action is “good” or “bad.” (If there were no such value system, 
the behaviors would be random.) Our biological value system, as men-
tioned before, is that survival is good and death is bad. This seems to be 
the biological purpose of feeling: it tells you whether your actions are 
good or bad within this scale of values. The outcomes of actions that 
enhance your chances of survival and reproductive success feel good (this 
is “pleasure”) and their opposites feel bad (this is “unpleasure”). Feelings 
register the consequences of your choices, as you make them, here and 
now. This enables you to determine, in the heat of the moment, whether 
one action is better or worse than another. In the example of air hunger, 
the regulation of your blood gases becomes conscious when you don’t 
possess an automatized solution to maintain your physiologically viable 
bounds. In your rush to escape from a carbon-dioxide-filled room, for 
instance, how do you know where to turn? You have never been in this 
situation before (in any burning building, let alone this specific one), so 
you cannot possibly predict what to do. Now you must decide whether to 
go this way or that, up or down, etc. You make such choices by feeling 
your way through the problem: the feeling of suffocation waxes or wanes, 
15The transition from glucose metabolism to hunger, just described, entails a similar transi-
tion. Core body temperature control provides another example: as your temperature rises, your 
body (not you) down-regulates it by perspiring and panting, but beyond a certain limit you feel 
too hot; then you must do something, like leave the kitchen.

REVISION OF DRIVE THEORY
1051
depending on whether you are going the right way or not—that is, depend-
ing on whether the availability of oxygen increases or decreases.
So it seems that what distinguishes autonomic need from mental 
drive is the necessity for feeling. This answers the fundamental question 
posed earlier: what does sentient subjectivity do? Unpleasure tells the 
organism that things are getting worse (i.e., drive pressure is increasing), 
while pleasure tells it that things are getting better (drive pressure is 
decreasing), in unpredicted situations, and thereby underwrites the enor-
mous adaptive advantages that a capacity for voluntary behavior bestows 
upon an organism.
This restores the simple psychophysical relationship between drive 
and pleasure-unpleasure that Freud thought he had to abandon. But please 
note: if the basic mechanism of drive is homeostasis, then the ideal state 
of the organism is not pleasure but rather satiation. “Satiation” is reached 
when viable bounds are regained; then the feeling at issue is resolved and 
it disappears from the radar of consciousness. This entire mechanism is 
illustrated in Figure 1.
Crucially, the mechanism I have just described drives not only volun-
tary behavior but also learning from experience. Learning is governed by 
Figure 1.  Feeling homeostasis: The “settling point” represents 
the organism’s viable bounds

Ma r k So lms

the Law of Affect,16 which states that “if a behavior is consistently accom-
panied by pleasure it will increase, and if it is consistently accompanied 
by unpleasure it will decrease.” For example, if you are a firefighter who 
has been in many burning buildings, you will gradually become less 
uncertain about what to do (you will have recourse to better predictions) 
and, accordingly, you will be less overwhelmed by affect (you will have 
less need of it, since affect is felt uncertainty). This applies quite gener-
ally, of course, and not only to suffocation alarm.
Learning, on this view, is a matter of prediction. We do not learn just 
because we can; we learn because we must. We learn how to meet our 
needs in the world. Memories are about the past but they are for the future. 
They predict the future on the basis of past experience. I will return to this 
important topic—which introduces the fundamental role of mental  
“representation”—in later sections. First, though, I must draw attention to 
the implications for Freudian drive theory of the simple mechanism I 
have just described.
The first implication is that drives are conscious, by definition. To me, 
it makes no sense to speak of hunger or thirst or suffocation alarm if you 
do not feel them. If you do not feel hungry, you are not hungry. It is true 
that the bodily needs that ultimately give rise to hunger and thirst (energy 
balance, sodium/water balance) are in the first instance monitored and 
regulated unconsciously, but these are not the kinds of processes that Freud 
denoted by the term “the unconscious.” They remain on the bodily side of 
his frontier between the mental and the somatic. I propose that we use the 
term “nonconscious” for such nonmental processes.
I likewise propose that we define “affect” as the subjective aspect of 
“drive.” I know this is a radical departure, but I do not see how we can 
avoid it. The distinction between the two terms nevertheless remains sig-
nificant. In my view, the subjective aspect of the functioning of the men-
tal instrument defines the observational perspective on it that is adopted 
by psychoanalysis; it defines the limits (and methods) of our discipline. 
The very same things that we psychoanalysts study from the subjective 
viewpoint, including unconscious intentionality, can be studied from the 
objective viewpoint, as neurobiologists do.17 The requirement to study 
16This is a mischievous rewording of the behaviorist Law of Effect, which speaks of 
“rewards” and “punishments” but does not define what they are because it denies the existence 
of feelings (see Panksepp and Biven 2012).
17The inter-discipline of neuropsychoanalysis aims to integrate the subjective and objec-
tive perspectives.

REVISION OF DRIVE THEORY
1053
them objectively and subjectively is illustrated by such fundamental facts 
as the following.
I have said that the basic value system of biology is that it is good to 
survive and reproduce and bad not to do so. This explains objectively why 
pleasurable feelings came to be attached, through natural selection, to 
sexual behaviors—and to orgasm in particular (see above). However, 
these are not the values that motivate us subjectively to engage in such 
behaviors. When we have sex, we are not trying to perform our biological 
duty; on the contrary, we are frequently trying not to reproduce while hav-
ing sex. This is because what motivates us subjectively are feelings, not 
the evolutionarily conserved mechanism that explains, objectively, why 
we have such feelings. This is not a semantic point. Confusion on this 
score gave rise to the mistaken belief, by Freud and a century of his fol-
lowers, that psychological sexual maturity coincides with reproductive 
(heterosexual) “genitality.” This is plainly not true, as surely any psycho-
analyst can attest: it is perfectly possible to have psychologically mature 
homosexual relationships. The same erroneous assumption—namely, that 
biological causes must be psychologically represented, albeit uncon-
sciously—gave rise to the mistaken belief that castration anxiety (as all 
the “primal fantasies”) arises from unconscious phylogenetic memories. 
There are no such things as inherited memories, a neurobiological impos-
sibility; but, as I have said, I will defer that topic to another paper (see 
Solms in press).
The second implication of the basic mechanism of drive is that what 
we are striving for is satiation, not pleasure. I will explain the details in 
section (C), when we reconsider the classification of the drives; for now I 
am making only the general point: pleasure predicts satiation; it tells you 
that you are heading in the right direction, but it is not the end of a drive. 
The pleasure-unpleasure series is not a continuum but an oscillator (see 
Figure 1).
Freud correctly inferred that the aim of every drive is satisfaction, but 
he incorrectly (I believe) equated satisfaction with pleasure. This had 
many baneful consequences. Not least of them was his assumption—
since it is clear that many compulsive human behaviors are aimed not at 
pleasure but rather at what might be termed quiescence—that there must 
be a deeper principle in mental life, “beyond the pleasure principle.” This 
became his Nirvana principle. I hope it is clear from what I have said, 

Ma r k So lms
1054
first, that the pleasure principle is an extension of the Nirvana principle, 
that it serves the Nirvana principle. Second, I hope it is clear that, far from 
being deathly, satiation or “nothingness” (i.e., no needs making demands 
on the mind for work) is the ideal state of all self-preservative and libidi-
nal creatures: it represents the successful outcome of work performed in 
response to drive demands.18 Third, therefore, there is no need to invoke 
the existence of a separate “death” drive that serves the Nirvana principle; 
it is served by the “life” drives and it represents their ideal state. To be 
clear, there is no need (or justification) to conclude that “the aim of all life 
is death” (Freud 1920, p. 38; his emphasis). Here, again, Freud was con-
flating psychology with biology. The individual organism does not aim 
for death, psychologically, although it is our inevitable biological 
destination.
This is not to say that the psychological phenomena that Freud associ-
ated with the death drive do not exist. They appear to be of two kinds: 
developmental and pathological. The “repetition compulsion” (and the 
developmental phenomena associated with it, which Freud drew attention 
to, such as children wanting to repeat endlessly the same games and sto-
ries) seems to me simply an expression of the compulsion to reduce uncer-
tainty (i.e., to increase predictability) mentioned above—and to be 
elaborated further in sections (B) and (D) below—which lies at the heart 
of “learning from experience.” The pathological phenomena that Freud 
drew attention to are self-destructive behaviors of various kinds: the phe-
nomena of malignant narcissism, negative therapeutic reactions, addic-
tions, suicidality, and other such omnipotent mental formations. For the 
sake of brevity, since this is not a clinical paper, I will make a swift gener-
alization. What these phenomena have in common (apart from the fact that 
they are not the expressions of a natural drive, precisely because they are 
pathological) is the fact that they are attempts to achieve satiation by “short 
circuit”; that is, they are attempts to satisfy the demands made upon the 
mind for work without actually doing the work. In other words, they are 
attempts to evade the reality principle, which is indeed a dangerous (and 
potentially fatal) thing to do. These are failures of ego functioning.
18Many readers will object at this point that satiation is not the goal of all motivated behav-
ior. This is partly because the principle applies only in the long run (i.e., satiation is, on average, 
the goal of motivated behavior) but more so because I have not yet had opportunity to introduce 
the multiple drives that conflict with each other, and that include a default-mode SEEKING 
drive, the homeostatic settling point of which is proactive engagement with uncertainty (e.g., 
with novelty).

REVISION OF DRIVE THEORY
1055
I have space for just one brief example. In section (C) I will introduce 
an “attachment” drive called PANIC/GRIEF, the command neuromodula-
tor of which is beta endorphin acting on mu opioid receptors. Like all 
drives, PANIC/GRIEF makes demands upon the mind for work. The work 
in this case is to establish reunion with a missing caregiver. As we know, 
this can be difficult, especially for children who grow up in less than ideal 
circumstances. One way of dealing with the demand (which is felt as sepa-
ration distress) is to avoid the real-life difficulty by replacing the desired 
object with an opiate drug (e.g., morphine or heroin). In this way you can 
achieve satiation (psychologically: the removal of separation distress; 
physiologically: mu opioid receptor binding) not by real reunion with the 
lost object, through mental work, but rather by short-circuiting the reality 
principle; i.e., by trying to trick or cheat it, which always ends badly. (E.g., 
heroin does not really take care of you.) This is deathly, but it is not the 
expression of a drive; it is a mechanism of defense.
(B) The Relationship between Drive and Entropy
I have said that the function of homeostasis is to maintain an organ-
ism within its viable bounds. Deviations from these bounds are entropic, 
and the mental work demanded by drives must return the animal to them. 
Hence, the work is anti-entropic. Moreover, it must be effective work.
“Entropy” is expressed in different ways in different disciplines. In 
thermodynamics it is described in terms of temperature and heat exchanges 
between a system and its environment, and in information science it is 
described in terms of information exchanges. Information exchange 
entails a system asking questions of its environment and receiving 
answers from it. (The aim of this is to reduce uncertainty; a system needs 
to ask questions only when it cannot predict an outcome with certainty.) 
The fundamental definition of entropy in modern physics, therefore, 
revolves around probability. Probability and predictability are two sides 
of the same coin. This applies both to thermodynamic exchanges and to 
information exchanges (see Jaynes 1957). The classical example is that of 
a compressed gas from a small cylinder being introduced into a larger 
chamber. As the gas disperses in the chamber—which it does naturally—
entropy increases. Stated in terms of probabilities, this is because, as the 
molecules spread out to occupy all the possible positions in the larger 
container, it becomes increasingly difficult to predict the location of each 
and every molecule. The probability that a particular molecule will 

Ma r k So lms
1056
occupy a particular location becomes increasingly unpredictable. As the 
locations become increasingly unpredictable, more information is 
required to describe the microstates of the system. As a result of this, the 
overall state of the system has become more uncertain. Information is 
quantified in “bits” (binary digits, usually denoted by “1” and “0,” i.e., 
“yes” and “no”). This means, in the classical example, that more yes/no 
questions must be asked and answered to determine the positions of the 
molecules in the chamber; more information must flow before the position 
of each molecule can be specified.
To apply this concept from statistical physics to the biology of drive, if the 
function of a drive is to counteract entropy in a biological system, then it must 
act to minimize the information flow required to maintain its survival (i.e., it 
must reduce the number of questions that need to be asked by the system). 
Stated differently, the drive pushes the system to minimize its uncertainty, to 
render environmental events more predictable. This is not complicated; it just 
means that the drive must counteract the system’s entropic tendency to dis-
perse itself across all its possible states. Contrary to this tendency, the drive 
must restore and maintain the system’s expected states.
To achieve this, as we know, the system must perform work, and this 
work must be effective. The energy in a system that is usefully employed 
(i.e., employed in effective work) is called “bound” energy, and the energy 
that is not usefully employed is called “free” energy. This, too, should 
sound familiar to you (see section [1] above). Like entropy, “free energy” is 
defined differently in different disciplines, but it always means the same 
thing, fundamentally: the energy in a system that is not currently employed 
in effective work is “free.” What this means is that if the system is going to 
survive as a system (i.e., if it is going to avoid dissipation), then the free 
energy in the system must be bound. This is the “free energy principle.”
In thermodynamics we speak of Helmholtz free energy, in chemistry 
we speak of Gibbs free energy, and in information science we speak of 
Friston free energy, also known as “variational” free energy. When Friston 
applied his free energy principle to the nervous system, he caused a revo-
lution, the full effects of which have not yet been felt, at least not by 
nonspecialists, but it has resulted in his having become (objectively) the 
most influential neuroscientist in the world.19 The revolution I 
19The influence of scientists (the number of times their work is cited in the specialist lit-
erature) is measured by their “h-index.” At the time of writing, Friston’s index is 236. To put 
this into perspective, Einstein’s is 110, Darwin’s is 119, and Newton’s is 62. Psychoanalysts will 
be pleased to know that Freud’s is 286; so, if we reclassify Freud as a neuropsychoanalyst, he 
(rather than Friston) would be the most influential neuroscientist in the world today!

am referring to is the insight that the entire nervous system functions 
according to a single principle, the free energy principle, derived from 
statistical mechanics. This is important for psychoanalysts because the 
laws of probability apply equally to physiological and psychological 
events. Somatic and mental events are therefore explicable in terms of a 
single unifying principle. What the free energy principle achieves, there-
fore, is nothing less than to render mental life quantifiable, at least in 
principle.20 The ramifications of this are enormous. For example, in my 
opinion, it brings the infamous “hard problem” of consciousness into the 
purview of statistical physics (see Solms 2021). (The hard problem con-
cerns the question of how conscious states can be caused by and cause 
physical states.)
What concerns us here, though, is that Friston himself has equated his 
conception of free energy with Freud’s “drive energy,” in terms of which 
drive energy is isomorphic with “expected free energy” (see Carhart-
Harris and Friston 2010). In other words, Friston’s free energy principle 
achieves Freud’s greatest ambition, namely, “to furnish a psychology that 
shall be a natural science: that is, to represent psychical processes as quan-
titatively determinate states of specifiable material particles, thus making 
those processes perspicuous and free from contradiction” (Freud 1895,  
p. 295). You will recall that Freud thought an energy was at work in the 
mind that is capable of increase, diminution, displacement, and discharge, 
and therefore possesses all the characteristics of a quantity, “though we 
have no means of measuring it” (Freud 1894, p. 60). Now we can measure 
it (for the grounding equations, see Solms and Friston 2018).
What exactly is the free energy principle? It is notoriously difficult to 
explain, so I will simplify. According to Friston, homeostasis in biology 
is an expression of an even more basic mechanism in physics, namely, a 
natural tendency toward “self-organization.” Self-organizing systems are 
intrinsically adaptive: they autonomously maintain their own structural 
and functional integrity despite environmental disruptions. The principle 
of self-organization bridges the divide between nonliving systems (like 
crystals that form spontaneously in liquid) and living ones (like cells), the 
20Here are two random examples: EEG entropy values are higher in fully conscious than 
in minimally conscious than in vegetative patients (Gosseries et al. 2011); and baseline fMRI 
activation increases and decreases predictably when research participants expect more or less 
precision in sensory signals (Hesselmann et al. 2010). Precision is inverse variance, which, like 
entropy, is a constituent of free energy (as will be explained below).

only difference being their degree of dynamic complexity.21 Self-
organizing systems can become even more complex in the face of exter-
nal perturbations, as if their interacting components have a unified 
goal, namely, to maintain their organized state. So self-organizing sys-
tems possess properties that Kant (1790) believed impossible: they have 
intrinsic aims and purposes; that is, they are “teleological.” Although 
Darwin never understood it so deeply, “natural selection” is an expression 
of this tendency. Self-organizing systems arise spontaneously from pri-
mal-soup-like conditions, when the short-range interactions between their 
subsystems become “ergodic”—which just means that they start to 
occupy limited states. Such systems spontaneously evolve toward a set-
tling point, which William Ross Ashby described as an “attractor” in a 
“basin” of surrounding states. The further evolution of these systems dis-
plays some remarkable features. The first is that they acquire a “Markov 
blanket,” which is something like a surrounding membrane that separates 
the system (and its internal states) from the not-system (its external 
states). This is the ground-zero origin of selfhood. That is, it bestows upon 
the system a “point of view,” which is the ground-zero origin of subjectiv-
ity. The lawful chains of influence that characterize Markov blankets 
make it impossible for the internal system to be influenced by the external 
not-system directly. The system (the “subject”) can register its environ-
ment (its “objects”) only indirectly, vicariously, via the effects that exter-
nal events have on the condition of its blanket. These conditions are called 
the “sensory states”22 of the blanket. This sequestered relationship 
between the interior of the system and the outside world is what generates 
its point of view. But the sensory states of the blanket have a second func-
tion. They influence the inner workings (the “internal states”) of the sys-
tem in such a way that they cause the internal states to generate “active 
21My point here is not to equate crystals with minds, of course, but rather to note that the 
causal mechanism of self-organization preceded biological self-organization, and, indeed, gave 
rise to it. (In fact, evolution itself is an expression of self-organization; see Friston 2013.) 
Crystals minimize their free energy in a trivial way because their nonequilibrium steady state 
has a point attractor. That is, they just arrange themselves into compact patterns and stay there, 
even when slightly disturbed. Things get far more complex when the attracting set has an itiner-
ant structure with dynamics of the sort that the human brain and mind conform to.
22Why are they called “sensory states” rather than “sensations”? This is because these 
formalisms apply to both living and nonliving systems; as stated above, they bridge the divide 
between physics and biology and, ultimately, psychology. The same applies to the “active states” 
described below, which in living systems would normally be called “actions.” Note that not all 
self-organizing systems (even biological ones) are conscious; I have not yet explained how 
conscious selfhood arises.

states” in the blanket, which then influence the external states. The exter-
nal states, in turn, as we know, influence the sensory states of the blanket. 
In this way, the consequences of the system’s actions are fed back to the 
system’s interior. The next remarkable development is that the internal 
states come to display what can only be described as the ground-zero 
origin of learning. That is, the internal states of the system naturally come 
to model its external states, so that the system generates the active states 
that are most likely to preserve its structural integrity. This is the crux of 
self-organization; if the system did otherwise, it would cease to exist as a 
system. This is the ground-zero origin of intentionality. Put differently, 
the system learns a capacity for statistical inference: it acts upon the world 
in ways that have proven likely to produce the required sensory conse-
quences. For example, if the system is overheating, it acts in the manner 
most likely to achieve cooler sensory states. (For the details summarized 
in this condensed paragraph, and for an empirical demonstration of how 
self-organizing systems displaying active inference arise naturally from 
primal-soup-like conditions, see Friston 2013.)
This brings us to the crux of the matter. The difference between the 
sensory states that are predicted by the system’s internal states to flow 
from its active states and the sensory states that actually flow from them 
must be minimized. This difference is called “surprisal.” Put simply: the 
system must avoid surprising (unexpected) states if it is going to survive. 
This is the mechanism of homeostasis all over again. Leaving aside some 
of the mathematical complexities, free energy is thus a function of aver-
age surprisal. The gap between the predicted sensory states of a self-
organizing system and its actual states, over a given period of time, is 
measured as its free energy. Because increasing free energy is an existen-
tial threat to the system, the system must minimize the expected free 
energy. And this, it appears, is the fundamental mechanism of drive. Drive 
is a (quantifiable) measure of the demand made upon the system for more 
effective work.
Here comes the oddest part. When it comes to an information- 
processing system (like the nervous system and its mental apparatus), this 
means that the system must minimize the amount of information it requires 
from the environment. If that sounds counterintuitive, remember that it 
just means the system must have fewer questions of its environment; in 
other words, it must reduce its uncertainty. This, in turn, means that it 
must improve its internal model of the world—its knowledge of how to 

Ma r k So lms
1060
meet its needs in the world—and adjust its actions accordingly. And that, 
we now see, is the reality principle.
What all of this means, at bottom, is that drive pressure (affective 
arousal)23 must be minimized, and the way we do this is by generating the 
best predictions we can as to how we might reduce the pressure by meet-
ing our needs in the world. This is the great task of learning from experi-
ence. Let me be as clear as possible, since this is so fundamental: drive is 
a measure of the expected free energy in the mind, energy that must be 
deployed in effective work, work that requires learning. Learning, in turn, 
entails improving the system’s predictive model of its self-in-the-world, 
and this is the ground-zero origin of representation.24
It only remains to say, before we turn to the classification of the 
drives and their relationship to the body, that the brain mechanisms by 
which all of this is achieved are quite well understood. The “body- 
monitoring” structures that register and regulate homeostatic errors are 
located in the core brainstem and diencephalic nuclei that surround the 
central canal and lower cerebral ventricles. Perhaps not surprising is the 
fact that these nuclei are intimately connected with the brain mechanisms 
for arousal, the core ones of which are the nuclei of the reticular activat-
ing system.25 What would have surprised Freud, however, is that these 
mechanisms, the very fount of our drives, are also the fount of conscious-
ness. Freud wrote:
What consciousness yields consists essentially of perceptions of excitations 
coming from the external world and of feelings of pleasure and unpleasure 
which can only arise from within the mental apparatus; it is therefore possible to 
assign to the system Pcpt.-Cs. a position in space. It must lie on the borderline 
between inside and outside; it must be turned towards the external world and 
must envelop the other psychical systems. It will be seen that there is nothing 
daringly new in these assumptions; we have merely adopted the views on local-
ization held by cerebral anatomy, which locates the “seat” of consciousness in 
23As Donald Pfaff (2005) beautifully explains, increasing arousal is the same thing as 
increasing information-processing; the more uncertain an animal is, the more aroused it 
becomes. The converse of arousal, in a sense, is habituation. Therefore, the essential task of 
mental life (of what we psychoanalysts call “ego development”) is to learn how to minimize 
arousal. This is Freud’s Nirvana principle, but it is the very opposite of deathly.
24Here I am using the term “representation” in Freud’s sense, which, let us not forget, was 
grounded in Franz Brentano’s conception of intentionality (or “aboutness”).
25These mechanisms—the source-nuclei for dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine—
are the ones on which most current psychopharmaceuticals exert their “direct influence” on the 
drives (i.e., on affect).

the cerebral cortex—the outermost, enveloping layer of the central organ. 
Cerebral anatomy has no need to consider why, speaking anatomically, con-
sciousness should be lodged on the surface of the brain instead of being safely 
housed somewhere in its inmost interior [1920, p. 24; emphasis added].
The irony is that consciousness-as-feeling is indeed safely housed in 
the brain’s inmost interior. The system Cs. is not a cortical system; it 
arises from the core of the brainstem (see section [5] above). What this 
quotation makes clear, once more, is that Freud adopted neuroanatomical 
views that have since turned out to be wrong. We are therefore obliged to 
correct him in line with subsequent neuroscientific findings. As I have 
tried to show elsewhere (e.g., Solms 2018a), correcting metapsychology 
on this score has practical implications for our therapy. To use the termi-
nology introduced in this paper, improving our predictive model of how 
the mind functions enables us to do more effective work in it, and that in 
turn enhances the chances of survival (and reproductive fitness) of our 
discipline. (For more detail concerning the clinical application of the 
metapsychological formulations outlined here, see Solms 2018a.)
(C) Classification of the Drives and the Bodily Sources of Drive
There is no definitive taxonomy of the drives in neurobiology today. 
This is primarily because different scientists use different classificatory 
criteria. For example, Paul Ekman (Ekman et al. 1987) uses ethological 
observations of facial expressions and associated behaviors, whereas Jaak 
Panksepp (1998) uses the experimental effects of deep brain stimulation, 
electrical and chemical. Therefore, to pick an example more or less at 
random, these two scientists classify disgust differently. Ekman classifies 
it as a “basic emotion,” whereas Panksepp classifies it as a “sensory 
affect.” (I will explain these terms in a moment, but note that different 
taxonomies come with different nomenclatures, which can be confusing.) 
The important thing for our purposes is that both scientists agree that 
disgust exists and that it reliably displays specific physiological and psy-
chological properties. Taxonomies are artificial constructions that we 
impose upon nature. Perhaps, therefore, how we classify the drives 
doesn’t matter quite as much as how we understand them.
Here I will follow Panksepp’s classification and nomenclature, as 
they are the most widely used in affective neuroscience today. (Remember, 
though, that they are not universally accepted.)

Ma r k So lms
1062
Panksepp divides the drives into “bodily” and “emotional” types. He 
further divides the bodily drives into “homeostatic” and “sensory” sub-
types. These terms denote the interoceptive versus exteroceptive sources 
of two subtypes of bodily drive. Hunger, thirst, sleepiness, and bowel 
distention, for example, are interoceptive, whereas pain, fright, affective 
touch, and disgust are exteroceptive. I do not use Panksepp’s term for the 
interoceptive bodily drives, because, as I have explained in section (A), 
and as I shall explain further here, all drives are homeostatic. The “emo-
tional” drives are distinguished from the “bodily” ones mainly by virtue 
of the fact that they do not arise from bodily needs so much as from what 
might be called object-relational ones. That is, they arise from biological 
needs in relation to other mental agents. This makes it more difficult for 
the subject of these drives to learn how to satisfy them, mainly for the 
reason that volitional agents are less predictable than inert objects. The 
indefiniteness of such distinctions coincides with the artificiality of our 
taxonomies. However, it is this distinction that makes the “emotional” 
drives more significant for psychoanalysts (and, indeed, for psychiatrists 
and psychotherapists in general). Because it is more difficult to learn how 
to keep a caregiver close and attentive than it is to learn how to defecate 
or to withdraw from pain, for example, our patients are far more likely to 
be troubled by their emotional than by their bodily drives. In addition, as 
we shall see, emotional drives are far more likely to conflict with each 
other than bodily drives are. This, too, makes it more difficult for us to 
learn how to master them. This does not mean that our patients never suf-
fer from unsatisfied bodily drive demands (witness sleep disorders, eating 
disorders, unexplained pain), but experience shows that these bodily ail-
ments are ultimately explicable in emotional terms. For example, it is not 
the case that patients suffering from anorexia nervosa do not know how to 
eat; rather, eating, for them, has become conflated with emotional drives 
they cannot master.
It is important to notice, therefore, contra Freud (see section [2] 
above), that not all drives have a bodily source. What is the bodily source 
of longing for the attentive presence of an attachment figure, for 
example?26
26This is not to deny that emotional drives (like attachment) serve survival and reproduc-
tive success over the long term or that they are intimately connected with bodily needs (e.g., in 
the case of attachment, see Hofer 1996). My point is that once an emotional drive (e.g., need for 
proximity of a caregiver) evolves, it exists in its own right; the need for care is not the same 
thing as the need for nourishment. This has important implications for Freud’s theory of “ana-
clisis.”

REVISION OF DRIVE THEORY
1063
For the reasons just stated, I will say relatively little else about the 
bodily drives here, and will focus instead on the emotional ones. Before 
proceeding, however, some general principles must be outlined that apply 
to all drives. The first is that they are always associated with affects. (That 
is why Panksepp speaks of homeostatic and sensory affects; recall the 
distinction made in section [A] above: affects are the subjective aspect of 
drives.) This is important because many people fail to recognise that 
bodily states like sleepiness and the urge to defecate are both drives and 
affects, yet that is what they are. I stated in section (A) that the defining 
feature of every drive is that it is affectively valenced; that is, it has a 
pleasurable and an unpleasurable dimension. Hence, fatigue feels bad and 
rest feels good; a distended bowel feels bad and voiding it feels good. The 
distinction between “negative” and “positive” drives is thus a misnomer. 
Anger is a negative drive, but discharging it (e.g., successfully annihilat-
ing a rival) feels good. Fear is a negative drive, but escaping the danger 
and finding safety feels good. The second principle to notice is that each 
drive feels good and bad in its own categorical way. There are a great 
variety of different pleasures and unpleasures. Thus, the unpleasure of 
hunger feels utterly different, qualitatively, from the unpleasure of a full 
bladder. There is a good reason for this: as explained in section (A), feelings 
are calls to action that tell us how we are doing in relation to a specific 
need. Accordingly, eating will do nothing to relieve your bladder, and 
urinating will not satisfy your hunger. (Recall a point I made in section [2] 
about the “confluence” of drives: each drive must be satisfied in its own 
right; it makes no biological sense to say that 3/10 of thirst plus 7/10 of 
pain equals 10/20 of total drive pressure. This is why affects are—indeed, 
must be—distinguished qualitatively, as all categorical variables must be. 
This is the ground-zero origin of qualia. I will return to this important 
point below.) The third principle is that we are equipped with innate pre-
dictions as to what must be done to satisfy each drive. As I have noted, 
however, these reflexes and instincts must be supplemented through 
learning from experience. This is the main task of mental development: 
learning how to satisfy our drives, and especially the emotional ones, 
which are so difficult to master.
Two further general principles in relation to this revised conception 
of drive shed new light on the questions that bedeviled Freud. I will men-
tion them only briefly now and elaborate later. The first is that there are 
both “appetitive” and “consummatory” pleasures (see the distinction 

Ma r k So lms
1064
between “wanting” and “liking” [Berridge 2003]). Had Freud known this, 
he would not have been so puzzled by foreplay and, more so, by the fact 
that sexual excitement is pleasurable. Sexual desire is appetitive; orgasm 
is consummatory. The second is that drives are aroused by both “needs” 
and “opportunities.” Sexual desire, for example, can have both internal 
and external triggers. To say this is to say the obvious, but had Freud been 
familiar with the concept of “incentive salience” he might have thought 
differently about issues like the bodily sources of drive. As I will explain 
shortly, however, the sources of our emotional drives are the “inmost inte-
rior” of the brain itself.
When it comes to the emotional drives, it turns out that seven of them 
can be reliably elicited by electrical or (specific) chemical stimulation at 
exactly the same brain sites, in all mammals, from mice to men. (Many of 
them can be evoked in birds, too, and some in all vertebrates.) Mammals 
and birds shared a common ancestor about 200 million years ago, and 
vertebrates evolved about 525 million years ago; that is how primitive 
these drives are.
Panksepp put his terms for the drives in full capitals, to distinguish 
them from colloquial usage—that is, to indicate that he was talking about 
whole biological systems, not only the feelings. Here is a brief summary 
of the seven emotional drives (also known as the “basic emotions”).27
LUST.  One is not constantly sexually aroused. Erotic feelings enter 
consciousness only when sex is prioritized over other things, which hap-
pens in the context of fluctuating needs and opportunities (as in the case 
of all drives; for the mechanism of prioritization, see section [D] below). 
When sexual desire is prioritized, one feels it; then erotic feelings guide 
one’s voluntary actions. One pays attention to different things when one 
is sexually aroused compared to when one is fearful, say, and one 
behaves differently too. In this way, exteroceptive consciousness and 
voluntary behavior are determined by your drive state; you experience 
the world differently—you literally bring different experiences upon 
your head—depending on what you are feeling. That is why, when the 
need for safety is prioritized, another drive takes over and sexual needs 
recede from consciousness.
27See Panksepp (1998) for the empirical findings on which the following summary is 
based, and for the bibliographic references. The remainder of this section draws heavily on 
Solms (2021).

REVISION OF DRIVE THEORY
1065
I am starting this account of the drives with LUST not only because 
it is the preeminent drive in biology, and in the history of psychoanalysis, 
but also because it is unclear whether LUST should be classified as a 
“bodily” or an “emotional” drive. Some people even doubt that sexuality 
is a need. This is an excellent example of the difference between (noncon-
scious) needs and the feelings they give rise to. As discussed in section 
(A), what motivates subjective beings is the pursuit of pleasure, not repro-
ductive success. The same applies to sweet tastes, for example; we eat 
candy because we like it, not because it contains high energy supplies 
(which is the evolutionary biological reason why sweet things taste 
good).28 That is, we are driven by feelings. Living creatures need to repro-
duce, at least on average; that is why the sexual drive became subjectively 
pleasurable, through natural selection—even though most people know 
nothing about the underlying biological mechanism, and perhaps do not 
even endorse it.
I say “on average” because not all sexual activity results in reproduc-
tion, just enough of it to keep the species going. This exemplifies a central 
principle concerning reflexes and instincts: the limited utility of inborn 
behaviors to meet our emotional needs. This is the main reason why emo-
tional drives (as opposed to bodily ones) are so difficult to master. In sex, 
the inborn reflexes and instincts boil down to little more than genital 
engorgement and lubrication, lordosis (arching the back, which makes the 
vagina available for penetration), mounting, intromission, thrusting, and 
ejaculation. Together with these reflexes, stroking the clitoris or penis 
(which are anatomically equivalent organs) at a certain rhythm produces 
pleasurable sensations that predict the release of sexual tension, ideally 
through orgasm, to satiation.29 These involuntary contrivances do not 
equip us for the difficult task of persuading other people—especially the 
particular ones we are attracted to—to comply with our desire to have sex 
with them. As already stated, the main reason why “emotional” needs are 
more difficult to meet than “bodily” ones is that they typically involve 
other agents who have needs of their own; they are not mere substances 
like food and water. To satisfy the sexual drive, therefore, we must sup-
plement our innate knowledge with additional skills, acquired through 
28But the sensory-affective pleasure in sweet tastes has nothing to do with reproduction, 
and it is not driven by LUST. As I have already said, there are many different pleasure systems 
in the brain.
29Note that once satiation is achieved, sex is no longer pleasurable.

Ma r k So lms
1066
learning. This fact alone explains the wide variety of sexual activities that 
we indulge in, alongside the “average” form.
Notice that learning does not extinguish reflexes and instincts; it 
nuances, elaborates, supplements, and then overrules them—but they are 
still there. The usual neurocognitive mechanism for updating long-term 
memories (“reconsolidation”; see section [D] below) doesn’t apply to 
reflexes and instincts. That is because reflexes and instincts are not mem-
ories; they are fundamental dispositions “hard-wired” into each species 
through natural selection (see Ellis and Solms 2018).
Our range of sexual behaviors is increased further by the fact that the 
brain circuits for both female-typical and male-typical LUST exist in 
every mammal. This is important confirmation of Freud’s notion of innate 
“bisexuality.” The gender that comes to dominate in each individual is 
determined by various factors, centrally including genetic and intrauter-
ine ones (LeVay 1993). Psychoanalysis historically underestimated these 
latter factors. I will not go into the anatomical and chemical details here, 
except to point out that both male and female circuits arise in the hypo-
thalamus and terminate in the periaqueductal gray. In other words, like all 
the basic emotional drive circuits, they are almost entirely subcortical.
The remarks I have made already about the “sources” of the sexual 
drive may be complemented by a comment on its “objects.” Given the 
difficulties associated with persuading other people (especially preferred 
people) to have sex with us, why do we not simply satisfy the sexual drive 
through masturbation?30 The answer has everything to do with the fact 
that we have multiple emotional needs. Sexual needs must be met in con-
junction with all the other needs, such as the “attachment” needs to be 
discussed below.
SEEKING.  All the bodily needs (and, importantly, this includes 
sexual ones)—which are registered by “need detectors” located mainly in 
the medial hypothalamus—activate this second emotional drive.31 The 
30Note in this respect that the clitoris and penis are not childish “sources” of the sexual 
drive, as Freud (1905) assumed; rather, they are its first “objects,” as he implicitly realized when 
he developed the theory of narcissism, via “auto-erotism.” The erogenous zones are only 
“sources” of sexuality in the sense mentioned before, that is, of “incentive salience.” These 
zones when stimulated represent “opportunities” rather than “needs.” The true sources, in 
Freud’s sense, of LUST are the hormones and peptides testosterone, estrogen, progesterone, 
vasopressin, oxytocin, LH-RH, and CCK, and these can be aroused both by opportunities and 
by needs. The same principle applies to all the emotional drives, the homeostatic “control cen-
ter” of which, in every case, is to be found in the brain itself.
31These need detectors are the “sensory terminal organs” that Freud (1940) imagined were 
located in the interior of the body, which he assumed were “offshoots of the cortical layer.”

REVISION OF DRIVE THEORY
1067
SEEKING drive behaves in almost exactly the same way as Freud’s 
“libidinal” drive, but he did not know that LUST merely activates this 
drive; LUST and SEEKING are not the same thing. SEEKING generates 
energetic “foraging” behavior, accompanied by a conscious feeling state 
that may be characterized as expectancy, interest, curiosity, enthusiasm, 
or optimism. Unlike orgasm, therefore, which is accompanied by a “con-
summatory” affect, foraging is accompanied by an “appetitive” affect 
that is pleasurable in its own right. This form of pleasure motivates the 
organism to go out into the world in order to remove (or at least mini-
mize) the unpleasurable tensions generated by its other needs.
Think of a dog in an open field: no matter what its current bodily 
needs may be, foraging propels it to engage positively with the environ-
ment, so that it might satisfy them there. Almost everything that living 
creatures need is “out there”; then through foraging they learn, almost 
accidentally, which things in the world satisfy each of their needs. In this 
way, through SEEKING, they encode cause-and-effect relationships and 
thus bestow value (literally, meaning) upon the world. Objects do not, of 
course, have inherent meaning; their meaning is subjectively conditioned. 
This illustrates very well how stereotyped “objectless” drives lead to indi-
vidualized learning from experience. In this respect, the critics of Freudian 
drive theory cited at the outset of this paper drew a false dichotomy 
between our “biologized” metapsychology and a supposedly pure psy-
chology of “meaning making.”
It is important to recognize that the other drives become “confluent” 
in the SEEKING drive, but not in the manner Freud thought. First, the 
other drives are not “components” of SEEKING; rather, they are triggers 
of SEEKING. That is, they exist in their own right; and SEEKING is a 
drive of its own. Second, SEEKING has no special relationship with 
LUST. In fact, had Freud recognized that LUST activates SEEKING just 
like all the other drives do, he probably would not have described this 
energy as “libidinal” or “erotic.” It is an all-purpose pleasure-seeking 
(and object-seeking) drive. Third, it is incorrect to suggest that one “com-
ponent” SEEKING drive can be satisfied by another. All biological needs 
(including emotional ones) activate SEEKING, the satisfaction of which 
leads to the satisfaction of the initiating drives, depending on the oppor-
tunities a foraging animal encounters. But each of the underlying needs 
still must be met in own right, or the animal will die. Finally, LUST does not 
“lean upon” the self-preservative drives in the sense of Freud’s anaclitic 

Ma r k So lms
1068
mechanism; rather, LUST and the self-preservative drives, combined, 
lean upon SEEKING, and SEEKING is a drive in its own right.
In this last respect, SEEKING is unique among the drives in that it 
proactively engages with uncertainty (so as to make the world more pre-
dictable, in advance, before it surprises us; surprises can be dangerous). 
This is the origin of novelty-seeking, sensation-seeking, and risk-taking 
behavior. Foraging makes animals (and people) explore interesting things, 
so that they know what to expect when they encounter them in the future. 
Once a dog has explored a hedge, for example, and familiarized itself with 
its contents, it will be less interested in it the next time around. Accordingly, 
SEEKING is the “default” drive. When we are not in the grip of one of the 
other “task-oriented” drives, our consciousness tends toward this general-
ized interest in the world. This is what Melanie Klein termed an “episte-
mophilic” drive. It explains why you are reading this paper.
Anatomically, the pathways of the SEEKING circuit arise from the 
ventral tegmental area of the brainstem, from whence they course upward, 
to the lateral hypothalamus, nucleus accumbens, amygdala, and medial 
frontal cortex, and downward (like all the drives; see section [D]) to the 
periaqueductal gray. Chemically, its command neuromodulator is dopa-
mine. Unlike the other reticular activating systems, dopamine activity does 
not decrease with the onset of sleep. This reveals an interesting fact about 
SEEKING: it can be aroused even during sleep, by endogenous demands 
made upon the mind for work, leading to dreams (see Solms 2000). The 
demands in question need not be bodily ones; offline default-mode memory 
consolidation, too, can result in prediction errors requiring “mental work” 
for their resolution (and it is no accident that this work entails conscious 
feeling, which punctuates the unconsciousness of sleep).
The link with dreams makes clear why excessive SEEKING leads to 
psychosis, a central mechanism of which may be the forging of too many 
cause-and-effect relations (i.e., too much “meaning making”; see Kapur 
2003).32 It is easy to see why the SEEKING drive is also deeply impli-
cated in addiction (think of cocaine33 and amphetamines, which stimulate 
SEEKING directly); it is literally the brain’s “craving” system (see 
32Finding too many cause-and-effect relations arises from excessive SEEKING partly 
through an inflated sense of agency (megalomania), i.e., an excessive sense of being able to 
cause things.
33It is plausible that Freud’s discovery of the psychological properties of the “libidinal” 
drive was facilitated by his own experience of the effects of cocaine.

Volkow, Wise, and Baler 2017). It also plays a big part in gambling and 
other forms of excessive optimism. Later we shall see that SEEKING 
plays a pivotal role in mood disorders, as well. Depression is the very 
opposite of SEEKING (and of mania).
RAGE.  While animals engage positively with the world through 
SEEKING, in the optimistic belief that their drives will be satisfied there, 
things do not always go well for them. Just as evolutionary prehistory 
equipped them with reflexes and instincts that reliably predict ways to 
meet their bodily needs (including foraging), so too they are born with 
emotional behaviors that predict ways to get them out of trouble. In chal-
lenging situations of universal biological significance, these instinctual 
behaviors are prioritized. We animals are thereby spared the biological 
costs of having to reinvent the wheels that enabled our ancestors to sur-
vive and reproduce. Instincts are a precious inheritance. They transmit 
innate survival skills—implicit “knowledge” of how to respond in evolu-
tionarily predicted situations—along with the feelings that guide volun-
tary actions in unpredicted ones.
When the RAGE drive is triggered—as it is by anything that gets 
between an animal and the things that could satisfy its other drives—its 
consciousness is colored by feelings ranging from irritated frustration to 
blind fury. (Think of a vending machine that fails to deliver an item you 
just paid for.) But RAGE is not the only form of aggression. Affective 
neuroscientists speak also of “cold aggression” (mediated by the 
SEEKING drive; think of a lion chasing a springbok) and “dominance 
behavior” (mediated by the PLAY drive, to be described below, which 
entails a symbolic form of aggression: more bark than bite). The form that 
is mediated by RAGE is called “hot aggression.” The reflexes and 
instincts involved in it include piloerection, protrusion of nails, hissing, 
growling, and baring of teeth, followed by “affective attack”: lunging at 
the target of wrath and biting, kicking, or hitting it until it relents.34
Why do you feel the drive pressures that accompany such behavior? 
The answer is: the feelings tell you how you are doing, whether things are 
going well or badly for you, as you try to rid yourself of the obstacle—one 
that is often simultaneously trying to get rid of you. You sense the sweet-
ness of victory or the bitterness of defeat. This guides what you do next, 
34This is not an internal death drive directed outward; it is straightforward self-preservative 
aggression. However, aggression can be directed to the wrong object, and indeed toward the 
self.

Ma r k So lms

including the possibility that pain (a sensory affect that is suppressed dur-
ing affective attack) might become prioritized, thereby replacing RAGE 
and putting an end to the fight—and perhaps leading to flight.
How could this all go on automatically, without conscious evaluation? 
This question applies also to the role of affect in thinking—a topic I can 
fruitfully introduce here. As Freud taught us, thinking is “trial” action; the 
capacity to try things out in imagination; a capacity which, for obvious 
biological reasons, saves lives. This capacity is not unique to humans, but 
it is particularly highly developed in us. So let me use a human example. 
Picture this situation, derived from my own experience: My headmaster is 
frustrating me, arousing feelings of irritation. The instinctual response is 
affective attack. Now I think about the potential consequences. Instead of 
lunging at him, therefore, I inhibit the instinctual action and imagine my 
range of alternatives; I feel my way through them (“signal” affect). 
Eventually I settle upon a satisfactory solution: when nobody is looking, I 
deflate the tires of my headmaster’s car. In this way, I reduce my RAGE 
without suffering dire consequences. This illustrates, once again, why 
innate behavioral stereotypes must be supplemented by learning from 
experience, including the imaginary form of experience called thinking. 
Patients who fail to do this are in serious trouble. When faced with real-life 
frustrations, which frequently include conflicting needs (in this case, 
RAGE vs. FEAR), instinctual solutions are not enough. But again, please 
notice: supplementing instinctual responses through learning does not 
erase them. I decided not to attack my headmaster, but the inclination to 
do so remained, and would arise again in similar situations in future.
Emotions like RAGE are not “mere” feelings. Emotions play a fun-
damental role in survival and reproductive success. Imagine the conse-
quences if we didn’t stake claims on the available resources and prevent 
others from taking our share. If we couldn’t become frustrated, irritated, 
or angry, we wouldn’t be inclined to fight for what we need, in which 
case, sooner or later, we’d be dead. It is easy to overlook the biological 
function of emotion in the civilized conditions under which we live today. 
But we have only been living like this (i.e., in permanent settlements with 
artificial laws regulating social behavior) for about twelve thousand 
years. Civilization is a very recent feature of mammalian existence; it 
played no part in the design of our brains.
Conscious thinking requires cortex, but the feelings that guide it 
don’t. The circuit mediating RAGE is almost entirely subcortical, and, 

REVISION OF DRIVE THEORY
1071
like all the other drive circuits, it terminates in the brainstem periaqueduc-
tal gray.
FEAR.  The fight/flight dichotomy shows that affective attack is not 
always the best way to deal with an adversary. The contextual factors 
separating them are registered in the amygdala, which mediates both 
RAGE and FEAR drives.
Most mammals “know” from day one that some things are inherently 
dangerous. Newborn rodents, for example, freeze when exposed to a single 
cat hair—although they have never experienced cats and know nothing of 
their attitude to mice. It is easy to see why this is so; if each mouse had to 
learn from experience how to respond to cats, that would be the end of 
mice. (Which is probably how “castration anxiety” evolved.) This is one 
of a limited number of examples of objects that do possess intrinsic mean-
ing for us. Again we see the enormous biological value of the basic 
emotions.
We humans fear some stereotyped things—perhaps all the objects of 
the common phobias—and we avoid them by the same instincts and 
reflexes as other mammals do: freezing and fleeing. These behaviors are 
facilitated by rapid breathing, increased heart rate, and redirection of 
blood from the gut to the skeletal musculature. (Hence the loss of bowel 
control associated with extreme fear.) As with other emotions, the con-
scious feeling of fear tells one whether one is heading toward or away 
from safety, and thereby guides voluntary behavior.
An interesting example is provided by the patient SM, who suffered 
from Urbach-Wiethe disease, a rare genetic condition that results in bilat-
eral calcification of the amygdala. She felt no fear. (See Tranel et al. 
[2006], who researched SM’s subjective emotionality.) I have studied a 
large number of patients like this, as there is an unusually high incidence 
of Urbach-Wiethe disease in South Africa. I found their dreams to be 
particularly interesting; they are short, simple, and manifestly wishful, 
like children’s dreams (see Blake et al. 2019). One of the patients we 
studied, whose husband was unemployed, dreamt “My husband found a 
job; I was very happy.” Another, the mother of a disabled child, dreamt 
“My daughter could walk; I was very happy.” Another, who was too poor 
to travel, dreamt “I was on a bus, going on holiday; I was really happy.” 
Yet another, whose father had died, dreamt “I saw my father again; I was 
so happy.” These dreams are typical of Urbach-Wiethe sufferers. In light 
of the close similarity between them and the dreams of children, the role 

Ma r k So lms
1072
of the FEAR drive in the development of the “censorship” and the “super-
ego” are promising topics for future neuropsychoanalytic research.35
As I said, we humans have a few stereotyped fears. Imagine what 
would happen if each of us had to learn from experience what happens 
when we jump off a cliff. That is why we are descended from ancestors 
who felt disinclined to try. Those that did feel so inclined are not our 
ancestors because they left no offspring. We have every reason to be 
grateful for this inheritance.
But then one must learn what else to fear. One learns from  
experience—including thinking—that things other than spider bites and 
falling from dizzying heights can cause one harm. (This is a further illus-
tration of how innate drives give rise to “meaning making.”) Electrical 
sockets and the shocks they produce, for example, could not have been 
predicted by evolution, but they are just as dangerous as spiders. Also, 
one must learn what else to do when one is fearful, to supplement the 
instinctual responses. It is not adaptive to freeze or flee from everything 
that scares you (think of anxiety disorders), just as it is not adaptive to 
attack everyone that frustrates you. It should be clear by now what role 
conscious feelings play in this learning process; they teach us what is 
working and what isn’t in relation to the FEAR drive, before it’s too late, 
and thereby help us stay alive.
Fear conditioning reveals important facts about what is conscious 
and what is not. One of its special features is “single-exposure learning”; 
a child need only stick its finger into an electric socket once to prevent it 
from ever doing it again. It is easy to see why; the child was lucky to 
survive the first time, so why repeat the experience? However, as with all 
the other biological mechanisms that underwrite emotions, the child 
doesn’t know this in any representational sense; conditioning just hap-
pens automatically. This is because FEAR conditioning does not require 
the involvement of cortex. It can even occur in earliest childhood, during 
the first three years, before the hippocampus (the cortical structure 
responsible for “declarative” memory) has matured. This is the biological 
basis of “infantile amnesia.” For this reason alone, just like the famous 
patient HM (who lacked a hippocampus), many neurologically healthy 
people fear things without consciously knowing why.
35What I have in mind here is the interesting possibility that the superego is constituted not 
only through projected RAGE but also by FEAR, directly, which inevitably conflicts with 
RAGE.

REVISION OF DRIVE THEORY
1073
Cognitive scientists attribute fear conditioning to “unconscious” 
learning, but that is only because they neglect affect. It is true that many 
people are unconscious of the reasons why they fear things, but they are 
only too conscious of the associated feelings. Feeling is all that is required 
to guide voluntary behavior. This is easily demonstrated using a tachisto-
scope: if words like “murderer” and “rapist” are subliminally associated 
with face A, and “caring” and “kind” with face B, research subjects will 
feel a preference for face B when they are subsequently required to choose 
between them, even though they cannot say why. “Gut feeling” is what 
guides this choice, but feelings easily go unrecognized; so they are 
described cognitively by words like “guessing.”
This explains much of the perplexity that surrounds “unconscious 
emotions” both in cognitive science and in psychoanalysis. It is not the 
affects that are unconscious so much as the cognitive things they are 
about. As we saw above in relation to thinking, it can certainly help to 
know what one’s feelings are about, but that insight is not essential. In 
fact, sometimes it is better not to think before one acts, not least because 
thinking takes time, and delay can be biologically dangerous (see section 
[D] below).
The same applies to fear conditioning. Once we have learned to fear 
something—especially if we do not consciously know why—the association 
is well-nigh irreversible. As LeDoux (1996) memorably put it, FEAR 
memories are “indelible.” This reveals important facts about unconscious 
memory in general, a topic to be discussed in the next section. For now I 
will mention only that “nondeclarative” (unconscious) memories are hard 
to forget, for the same reason that they’re unconscious: they entail less 
uncertainty (i.e., are more generalizable) and are therefore less subject to 
contextual revision. This is how acquired behaviors become automatized. 
Insofar as the purpose of cognition is to learn how to meet our needs in 
the world, automatization is the ideal of learning.
PANIC/GRIEF.  Separation-distress is different from FEAR. This 
drive emerges only after we become instinctually attached to a caregiver. 
Unlike fear conditioning, but for equally good biological reasons, this 
takes time (up to six months): one instance of nurturant care is not 
enough to determine whether someone can be relied upon forever.
Let me make explicit something that has perhaps not been made suf-
ficiently clear in this section. All these emotional drives are homeostatic. 
Thus, for example, the “expected state” of RAGE is “nothing is getting 

Ma r k So lms
1074
between me and the satisfaction of my needs,” that of FEAR is “nothing 
is threatening my life and limb,” and that of PANIC/GRIEF is “my care-
giver is available and attentive to me.” (These nonconscious expectations 
are not really formulated in words, of course.) Deviations from such 
expected states are “error signals” (i.e., affects, heading in deteriorating 
or improving directions; see Figure 1).
When mammals become separated from their attachment figures, an 
instinctual sequence unfolds, starting with “protest” behavior and fol-
lowed by “despair.” The protest phase is characterized by feelings of 
panic, together with distress vocalizations and search behavior. The panic 
is frequently combined with anger—“where is she?!”—which evokes 
another conflict, this time between PANIC/GRIEF and RAGE. The one 
drive makes you want to keep your caregiver close to you, always and 
forever, whereas the other drive makes you want to destroy her. Guilt (a 
secondary emotion) is the typical outcome. This is a good example of 
how secondary emotions (like guilt, shame, jealousy, and envy) arise. 
Unlike the basic emotions, they are learned constructs—hybrids of emo-
tion and cognition (see Barrett 2017). Note, then, that the homeostatic 
emotions—the felt drives—under discussion here do not by any means 
exhaust the full range of human emotionality.
The despair phase of the separation-distress response is characterized 
by feelings of hopelessness, of literally “giving up.” The standard bio-
logical explanation is that if the separated pup’s crying and searching do 
not lead quickly to reunion, then the potential costs of alerting predators 
to its vulnerable state begin to outweigh the benefits. Also, if the pup 
wanders too far from home base, its chances of being found when the 
mother returns are reduced. Thus, on statistical balance, giving up (despite 
how painful it is) becomes the inherited survival strategy. This is another 
good example of how we know nothing of the biological mechanisms that 
gave rise to our instincts; all we know about are the feelings.
Here is a classical description of the separation-distress cascade in 
human children (Bowlby 1960):
[Protest] may begin immediately or may be delayed; it lasts from a few hours to 
a week or more. During it the young child appears acutely distressed at having 
lost his mother and seeks to recapture her by the full exercise of his limited 
resources. He will often cry loudly, shake his cot, throw himself about, and look 
eagerly towards any sight or sound which might prove to be his missing mother. 
All his behaviour suggests strong expectation that she will return. Meanwhile he 

REVISION OF DRIVE THEORY
1075
is apt to reject all alternative figures who offer to do things for him, though some 
children will cling desperately to a nurse.
[In despair, which] succeeds protest, the child’s preoccupation with his 
missing mother is still evident, though his behaviour suggests increasing hope-
lessness. The active physical movements diminish or come to an end, and he 
may cry monotonously or intermittently. He is withdrawn and inactive, makes 
no demands on people in the environment, and appears to be in a state of deep 
mourning [p. 90].
The latter state is of course akin to depression, which is often accom-
panied by guilt. As Freud (1917) taught us, depression (“melancholia”) is 
a pathological form of grief (“mourning”). Accordingly, Panksepp and 
others applied his elucidation of the brain mechanisms of the PANIC/
GRIEF drive to developing new treatments for mood disorders (see 
Yovell et al. 2016; Coenen et al. 2019). Chemically, the transition from 
“protest” to “despair” is mediated by mu and kappa opioids respectively, 
the latter of which shut down dopamine (for the immediate effects of 
which, see the startling case report of Blomstedt et al. [2008], of a patient 
who fell into a suicidal depression within seconds of a source nucleus for 
dopamine being electrically suppressed). That is why depression is char-
acterized by the mirror opposite of the feelings that characterize SEEKING 
(see Solms and Panksepp 2010). GRIEF, at the level of drive theory, is 
shut-down SEEKING. By contrast, full-blast SEEKING is mania, before 
it tips into psychosis. The anatomical trajectory of the PANIC component 
of the PANIC/GRIEF circuit descends from the anterior cingulate gyrus 
to the periaqueductal gray. Mayberg et al. (2005) and Coenen et al. (2019) 
show that deep brain stimulation of the PANIC and SEEKING (i.e., 
inverse GRIEF) circuits can dramatically alleviate symptoms of depres-
sion, within seconds, even in the most chronic and treatment-refractory 
cases. (I am not recommending this treatment but just saying that it pro-
vides proof of concept.)
It is interesting that the mu opioid–mediated PANIC system evolved 
from the brain’s older analgesic system; the mental anguish of loss is an 
extension of the bodily mechanisms for sensory pain. (That is presumably 
why mental pain is so frequently somatized.) This is a good example of 
the seamless transition that exists in nature between lifesaving sensory 
affects and emotional ones. There is nothing ephemeral about emotions. 
The painful feelings associated with separation and loss—coupled with 
learning from experience—play a causal role in ensuring the survival of 

Ma r k So lms
1076
us mammals (and birds), who need caregivers. This continues to apply 
beyond childhood, of course: the brain circuits just described mediate 
attachment bonds throughout life, as they also mediate, sadly, various 
forms of addiction (think of the opiate crisis). Most drugs of abuse act on 
either the PANIC or the GRIEF (shut-down SEEKING) drives. They are 
of course forms of self-medication. As we have known since Kraepelin, 
opiates are excellent (but dangerous) antidepressants.
It is important to acknowledge that Fairbairn and Bowlby, and some 
other early object-relational theorists, were right about “attachment” 
being an innate drive (and instinct) entirely separate from sexuality. The 
evidence for this is now overwhelming. The only link between the LUST 
and PANIC/GRIEF drives is the one I have mentioned: namely, that they 
both must be satisfied, which means they must be reconciled with each 
other, which can be difficult. It is difficult not only because the sexual 
drive is most securely satisfied in a relationship, but also because one’s 
original attachment figure is usually one’s mother. That is why it is diffi-
cult to reconcile LUST with what Freud called “affectionate bonds.”
CARE.  This is the flip side of PANIC/GRIEF attachment: we not 
only need loving care ourselves, but also need to look after others, espe-
cially little ones, and especially our own offspring. The so-called mater-
nal instinct exists in all mammals, but not to the same degree, because it 
is mediated by chemicals found at higher levels (on average) in females: 
estrogen, prolactin, progesterone, and oxytocin—all of which rise dra-
matically during pregnancy and childbirth. (Think of post-partum depres-
sion.) Also noteworthy is the overlap between the brain chemistry and 
circuitry for the CARE, PANIC/GRIEF, and female-typical LUST drives. 
These facts alone readily explain why depression is so much more com-
mon (almost three times) in women than in men.
Approximately 80 percent of human females somehow know from 
childhood that it is “good” to cradle babies to the left of the body midline, 
whereas males discover this (instinctually) only after they father children 
(Pileggi, Malcolm-Smith, and Solms 2015). On the other hand, even 
completely inexperienced boys usually know what to do when a baby 
cries. They do not prod it with their fingers or pick it up by the foot to see 
if that helps; they just know (they innately predict) that a “good” thing to 
do is to hold it close and rock it while making soothing noises.
And yet, as every parent learns, this is not enough. Successfully rais-
ing an infant to maturity requires a lot more than instinct. Therefore, as 

REVISION OF DRIVE THEORY
1077
with the other emotional drives, one must learn from experience (includ-
ing thinking) what to do in the myriad unpredicted situations that arise. 
As with the other drives, also, decisions in this respect are guided by feel-
ings (of care and concern) that tell us whether things are going well or 
badly. Another reason why a nurturant drive is not enough is that we do 
not feel only love toward our children, as any parent will attest. The resul-
tant conflicts can be resolved only through hybrid cognitive-emotional 
processes.
Learning how to reconcile the various emotional drives with each 
other in context-dependent ways is the bedrock of mental health and 
maturity. This conclusion is more consistent with the evidence now avail-
able than the notion of “stages of libidinal development.”36 Consider sus-
tainable romantic partnerships, for example, which require a judicious 
integration of LUST with childlike PANIC/GRIEF-type attachment (think 
of the Madonna-whore syndrome), which in turn is difficult to reconcile 
with the roving SEEKING drive (think of the thrill of novelty), as well as 
the inevitable frustrations that provoke RAGE (hence the ubiquity of 
domestic strife), which in turn conflicts with the concerns of nurturant 
CARE, and so on. Sustaining long-term relationships is just one example 
of the many challenges that face every human being. To manage these 
things—to manage life’s problems—we use feelings as our compass. It is 
feeling that guides all learning from experience, in the various forms I 
have outlined. But biology provides one further drive to help us on our 
way.
PLAY.  We need to play. This activity is not as frivolous as it appears: 
PLAY is the medium through which territories are claimed and defended, 
social hierarchies are formed (“pecking order”), and in-group and  
out-group boundaries are forged and maintained. I believe that this  
drive, more than any other, underpins the oedipus complex (see Solms in 
press).
People are often surprised to learn that PLAY is a biological drive, 
but all juvenile mammals engage in vigorous rough-and-tumble. If 
deprived of their quota on one day, they will try to make it up the next day, 
as if by rebound. We all know what rough-and-tumble play is, though the 
form it takes varies slightly from one mammalian species to another. A 
36Thus Freud’s notion of drive “fusion” and “de-fusion” remains serviceable, at least 
descriptively, if not mechanistically.

Ma r k So lms
1078
play session starts with an “invitation” posture or gesture; then, if the 
invitation is accepted, the game is on. The one animal or child exuber-
antly chases the other, they then stop as they wrestle or tickle each other, 
taking turns to be on top—accompanied by peals of laughter, or the 
equivalent vocalization depending on the species (even rats “laugh”; see 
Panksepp 2005). Then they are back on their feet again, chasing each 
other in the reverse direction. The associated feeling state is equally uni-
versal: it is called fun.
Children just love to play. Empirically, however, the majority of play 
episodes end in tears. This provides an important clue as to what PLAY is 
all about, biologically speaking; it is about finding the limits of what is 
socially tolerable, acceptable, and permissible. When play is no longer 
fun for a playmate, often because you are not being “fair,” the playmate 
won’t play anymore. A limit has then been reached. The marking of such 
boundaries is crucial for the formation and maintenance of stable social 
groups. And the survival of a group is important for the survival of each 
member of the group in social species such as ours.
A major criterion in this respect is dominance. In any play situation, 
one of the participants takes the lead role, and the other is submissive. 
This is fun for both parties, so long as the dominant one does not insist on 
calling the shots all the time. The acceptable ratio of turn-taking seems to 
be somewhere between 60:40 and 70:30. The “60:40 rule” states that the 
submissive playmate continues playing so long as sufficient opportunity 
is given to turn the tables.
This reveals a second function of the PLAY drive: namely, the estab-
lishment of social hierarchies. Rough-and-tumble play accordingly gives 
way (especially from puberty onward) to more organized, frankly com-
petitive games. Of course, play is not limited to games of the rough-and-
tumble variety. We humans engage in pretend play, in which the 
participants try out different social roles (e.g., Mother/Baby, Teacher/
Pupil, Doctor/Patient, Cop/Robber, Cowboy/Indian, King of the Castle / 
Dirty Rascal—note the ever present hierarchies). We do not know what 
goes on in the imagination of other mammals while playing, but we may 
confidently hypothesize that they too are “trying out” different social 
roles, and thereby learning what they can and can’t get away with.
This suggests a third biological function for PLAY. It requires us (and 
conditions us) to take account of the feelings of others. If we don’t, they 
will refuse to play with us, and then we will be deprived of the enormous 

REVISION OF DRIVE THEORY
1079
pleasure it yields. The bully might get to keep all the toys, but he will be 
deprived of all the fun. This, it seems, is why the PLAY drive evolved 
(and why so much pleasure attaches to satisfying it): it promotes viable 
social formations. It is, in a word, a major vehicle for the development of 
empathy.37
Play episodes come to an abrupt end when they lose their “as if” quality. 
If I lock up my little sister and throw away the key, then not only have I 
broken the 60:40 rule but I also am no longer playing the game of Cops and 
Robbers; instead I am imprisoning my sister. In other words, what is govern-
ing our mutual behavior now is FEAR or RAGE rather than PLAY. The 
same applies to the other games enumerated above. Playing “Doctor/Patient” 
is a game until it becomes real sex; then it is governed by LUST.
The same applies to the oedipus complex. The incest taboo ensures 
that it remains “as if”; failure to respect this limit has catastrophic conse-
quences for emotional development. Patients who cannot PLAY (i.e., 
who have not learned how to satisfy this drive effectively, as occurs in 
character pathology and some perversions, for example) are in serious 
trouble. They also find it difficult to use psychoanalytic treatment, which 
is at bottom a form of PLAY (think of the hierarchy, the mutuality, the 
boundaries, the “as if” quality, etc).
The fact that PLAY hovers, as it were, between all the other emo-
tional drives—trying them out and learning their limits—is perhaps the 
reason it has not been possible to identify a command neuromodulator for 
it. Probably it recruits them all. Anyone who doubts that PLAY is defini-
tively a drive, though, should read Pellis and Pellis’s The Playful Brain 
(2009).
We don’t always like to recognize that humans, like other mammals, 
naturally claim territories and form social hierarchies with clear rules. 
(The rules governing primate behavior are remarkably complex.) The 
structure of families, clans, armies, even nations—almost any social 
group—is undeniably hierarchical and territorial; and this has been so 
throughout history. The higher the social status of an individual within the 
group, the greater the access that individual has to the resources in the 
territory the group controls. This observation is not a matter of personal 
preference; it is a matter of fact. If we do not face such facts, we cannot 
37The development of empathy is therefore by no means an automatic process, as the “mir-
ror neuron” theory might suggest. Empathy is not a reflex; it is a developmental achievement 
(see Solms 2017a).

begin to deal with them. The fact that emotional drives exist does not 
mean we have no control over them—that we are obliged to bow before 
“the Law of the Jungle”; but we ignore them at our peril.
It is easy to see how PLAY, in particular, gives rise to social rules. 
Rules regulate group behavior, and thereby protect us from the excesses 
of our individual drives. It is also easy to see how social rules encourage 
complex forms of communication, and how they contribute to the emer-
gence of symbolic functioning in general. The “as if” quality of play sug-
gests that it might even be the biological precursor of thinking (i.e., of 
virtual vs. real action). Some scientists also believe that dreaming is noc-
turnal PLAY, i.e., trying out the instinctual emotions in an “as if” world. 
Interestingly, in REM behavior disorder, where the motor paralysis that 
normally accompanies dreams is lost due to midbrain damage, patients 
(and experimental animals) physically enact the various instinctual  
stereotypes—e.g., fleeing, freezing, predatory pouncing, affective attack. 
It cannot be without meaning that RAGE is far more common in humans 
with this condition than it is in other animals (e.g., cats). Like chimpan-
zees, humans are very aggressive creatures.
I cannot emphasize enough the clinical utility of the information 
summarized in this section, both for psychiatric nosology and for the psy-
chodynamic formulation of individual cases. I strongly encourage readers 
to consult my paper in Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience, an open-
access online journal (Solms 2018a). That paper, too, however, is just a 
summary; it does not do justice to the richness of what my colleagues and 
I have learned in several neuropsychoanalytic study groups that for more 
than six years now have been meeting around the world, discussing our 
ongoing analytic work with literally hundreds of cases. Our findings will 
be reported in due course, in a series of clinical papers (meanwhile, see 
Smith and Solms 2018).
(D) The Relationship between Drive and Conscious Qualities in General
Having proclaimed that drives are conscious, I will conclude with 
only a brief consideration of the unconscious—since I have written exten-
sively about this topic elsewhere (Solms 2017b, 2018a, 2021). In short, I 
believe it is a mistake to conflate drives with the unconscious; the “id” 
and “the unconscious” are not the same thing (see Solms 2013).
I have said that needs remain unconscious (in some cases, noncon-
scious) until they become drives. Here everything pivots on the fact that we 
have various competing needs that must be prioritized. A strong clue as to 

REVISION OF DRIVE THEORY
1081
where the selection is made is provided by the fact that all needs (both 
bodily and emotional ones) deliver their residual error signals to the mid-
brain periaqueductal gray (PAG). The term “residual” here refers to the fact 
that we are equipped with automatic mechanisms that can meet these needs 
up to a point. These mechanisms include not only the (nonconscious) auto-
nomic reflexes I have discussed but also the (unconscious) behavioral  
stereotypes that are acquired in the manner I will now describe.
The PAG truly is the “inmost interior” of the brain. It surrounds the 
central canal that joins the third and fourth ventricles and is an extremely 
primitive structure. Immediately adjacent to it is the tectum, which con-
tains the superior and inferior colliculi. These, in turn, contain layered 
representations of all the sensory modalities (except smell), which regis-
ter “where things stand now” in the outside world, in a highly condensed 
form known as an attentional “saliency map.” Thus, this ancient core of 
the brainstem constantly receives information about the current internal 
conditions in the PAG (i.e., current needs) and the current external condi-
tions in the superior colliculi (i.e., current opportunities). The task of this 
region, then, which also includes the final path to motor output (the mid-
brain locomotor region) is to make decisions about “what to do next.” 
That is why Merker (2007) calls it the “midbrain decision triangle.”
Panksepp calls it the primal SELF because the interface I have just 
described is, in effect, the brain’s meta-homeostat, which must choose 
among the competing error signals arriving from all the brain’s individual 
homeostats. Needs must be prioritized because you cannot do everything 
at once (e.g., eat and sleep). The selection is made on the basis of salience: 
the most “salient” need is the one that enjoys—or demands—the greatest 
current opportunity to reduce free energy (as defined in section [B]; for 
details see Solms 2021). The prioritized need is then felt, or, to put it dif-
ferently, the “decision” emanating from the midbrain decision triangle is 
announced in the form of a feeling. In other words, prioritized needs 
become drives. This has two consequences. First, the prioritized feeling is 
the one that is used to guide the next cycle of voluntary behavior; and 
second, all other current needs are relegated to automatic control—that is 
autonomic (internal) control and automatized (external) behavior.
Now the forebrain kicks in. This contains the long-term memory 
structures that represent a self-organizing system’s predictive model of 
the world (see Figure 2). This model is arranged hierarchically, and con-
centrically, from the autonomic core (which contains innate predictions)

upward and outward, through the subcortical forebrain to the cortex 
(which contains acquired predictions). This hierarchy becomes activated 
(or, to use Freud’s terminology, “cathected”). What is activated, repre-
sented from long-term memory, is the expected sensorimotor context 
within which the prioritized drive demand will be met. We do not go 
naively into the world in which we meet our needs; we enter it with 
expectations (predictions) based not only in reflexes and instincts but also 
in all that we have learned about how to meet our needs more effectively 
over our individual lifetimes (through learning from experience).
So an expected context is activated in the forebrain by the reticular 
activating system, which receives massive inputs from the midbrain deci-
sion triangle. The forebrain memory traces that represent the expected 
context are thereby assigned what computational neuroscientists call 
“precision” weightings and what neurophysiologists call “post-synaptic 
gain.” Precision (or gain) is a measure of uncertainty, which, as we saw 
in section (A) is isomorphic with arousal. These precision values—which 
actually determine the ensuing behavior—are assigned in two different 
ways. Those pertaining to the automatic behaviors are assigned fixed 
weightings, and those pertaining to the voluntary behaviors (the ones 
associated with the prioritized drive) are assigned variable ones. What 
this means is that the latter weightings are modulated on the basis of the 
unfolding experience. In other words, they are palpated by feeling—
which generates cognitive judgments, on the basis that it is “good” when 
the precision (the uncertainty) attaching to current predictions increases 
and “bad” when it decreases. In other words, cognitively no less than 
affectively, it is good when things turn out as expected and bad when 
uncertainty prevails. Increasingly or decreasingly precise predictions, in 
turn, are determined by the strength of the incoming error signals. In other 
words, increasingly strong error signals decrease confidence (precision) 
in the current prediction—which is of course bad from the viewpoint of 
the system. These error signals are then propagated inward through the 
predictive hierarchy and they adjust the predictions that gave rise to 
them. This happens iteratively, while progressively better predictions 
damp down the error signals. Then the whole process begins again, as the 
residual errors are fed back to the midbrain decision triangle, which then 
either maintains or shifts the currently prioritized need and associated 
actions. That, in essence, is how learning works: it entails updating of the 
predictive model on the basis of strong (i.e., precise) error signals.

The constellation of representations that are palpated in the way I 
have just described are held in short-term or “working” memory. This is 
an entirely cortical form of representation that is synonymous with cogni-
tive consciousness (i.e., perception and thinking). What is especially

autonomic core to the sensorimotor periphery
(Learning flows from right to left in this diagram; predictions flow in the opposite direction.)

interesting to psychoanalysts is the fact that memory traces activated in 
this way become labile once more; in other words, they literally dissolve 
and are memories no longer.38 This is because they are in the process of 
being updated. Neurophysiologists call this updating process “reconsoli-
dation.” I have proposed the phrase “predictive work in progress” to 
describe what reconsolidation does.
It is clear that reconsolidation occurs constantly at the sensorimotor 
periphery (righthand side of Figure 2); but as a prediction proves increas-
ingly reliable over time, so it slowly becomes more deeply “consolidated” 
into long-term memory. There are many reasons for this, not least of them 
being the severe capacity constraints of short-term memory, but the ulti-
mate reason is dictated by the free energy principle itself: the predictive 
model must be accurate. However, accuracy comes with complexity 
costs. Excessive complexity leads to statistical “overfitting” and many 
other computational and biological problems. The way the system 
resolves this dilemma is to consolidate predictions that prove to be accu-
rate in a wide variety of contexts (the simpler, more generalizable ones) 
ever more deeply into the system, ultimately into the “nondeclarative” 
layers of the predictive model, and to retain only those that must be con-
textually updated (the more complex, less generalizable ones) in the 
“declarative” layers. This is because precision modulation has everything 
to do with changing contexts. The cortex specializes in contexts, and 
therefore in the delay that is the downside (or one of the downsides) of 
complexity. Thus, nondeclarative predictions are more certain than 
declarative ones, and they can therefore be executed automatically. That, 
I have proposed, is how “the unconscious” (as opposed to the noncon-
scious) is constituted (Solms 2017b).
Declarative (cortical) long-term predictions are “preconscious,” and 
nondeclarative (subcortical) ones are “unconscious.” The unconscious—
more certain—ones apply over a wider range of spatial and temporal con-
texts, which coincides with Freud’s description of them as “timeless.” 
These are the predictions that can be executed automatically, in the man-
ner described above, and they behave the most like instincts. It will be 
noticed that fixed precision values permit what Freud called “freely 
mobile” cathexis (i.e., no delay), while variable precisions that are “held

p. 25).

1085
in mind” (in working memory) during predictive work require what Freud 
called “bound” cathexis (see Solms 2020). This coincides with his dis-
tinction between the primary and secondary processes.
The “repressed” portion of the unconscious consists of predictions 
that were prematurely or illegitimately automatized, either because they 
were automatized before the maturation of the declarative memory sys-
tems (infantile amnesia) or because they were the child’s “solutions” to 
problems that proved insoluble. The sexual strivings of children are a 
good example of an insoluble problem, so their “solution” is almost inevi-
tably subject to repression. Importantly, unlike the other automatized pre-
dictions in the “descriptive” unconscious, the repressed ones give rise to 
prediction errors (negative affects; i.e., drive demands). Moreover, unlike 
declarative predictions, which enjoy updating (reconsolidation) when 
they give rise to such errors—that is, when they become salient—
repressed predictions remain “timeless.” They also display the other three 
“special characteristics of the system Ucs.” identified by Freud (1915b,  
p. 187): they show “exemption from mutual contradiction” (which is just 
another way of saying they are unrealistic and do not actually resolve the 
problem); they show “replacement of external by psychical reality” 
(which is another way of saying that the prediction is maintained regard-
less of the evidence); and they use “primary process” (i.e., freely mobile 
cathexis). It should be noted that instinctual predictions, too, are indelible, 
for the reason I have outlined (viz., they are not really memories  
and so are not subject to reconsolidation). In this sense we can say, with 
Freud, that instinctual predictions form the “nucleus” of the dynamic 
unconscious.
Since repressed predictions inevitably produce negative affects (the 
so-called “return of the repressed”),39 the only recourse available to the 
subject in this case is “defense.” (Note, therefore, that repression is not 
synonymous with defense.) Accordingly, patients fall ill when their 
defenses fail; and our patients suffer mainly from feelings. The feelings in 
question reveal which drive demand is not being met, which is why it is 
important for psychoanalysts to acquaint themselves with the “basic emo-
tions” described above. The repressed prediction, in its turn, is repeated 
(enacted) in the “transference,” for the very reason that it cannot be

cannot be remembered, by definition); it is the affect that returns when the defense fails.

remembered. Since I have written elsewhere on these more clinical top-
ics, I will break off at this point (see Solms 2018b).
Conclusion
In this paper I have proposed extensive revisions to Freud’s theory of the 
drives. The main revisions are as follows: (1) Drives are conscious; they 
are in fact the fount of all consciousness. (2) Drive energy may be equated 
with Friston free energy and is therefore quantifiable in principle. (3) 
There are not two drives but many, seven of which may be described as 
“emotional” as opposed to “bodily.” (4) All drives are self-preservative or 
preservative of the species; there is no death drive at work in the mind. 
That is, all drives are homeostatic and therefore anti-entropic. (5) The 
great task of mental development is to supplement instinctual predictions 
about how these multiple drive demands may be satisfied and reconciled 
with each other in unpredicted contexts. This work is done through learn-
ing from experience, which is governed by the Law of Affect.
Although these revisions are derived from neuroscientific research 
findings, which implies that they are open to ongoing testing by neurosci-
entific methods, I want to end by insisting that the clinical situation 
remains best suited to determining and refining the utility of new psycho-
analytic theories. When Freud (1915a) wrote that “working over the psy-
chological material . . . seems rather itself to call for the application to the 
material of definite assumptions concerning the life of the drives, and it 
would be a desirable thing if those assumptions could be taken from some 
other branch of knowledge and carried over to psychology” (p. 124), he 
surely did not mean that a psychological working-over of the material 
adds nothing to the assumptions carried over from biology. The revision 
of drive theory that I have proposed here, therefore, some years after the 
theoretical breakthrough that gave rise to it (Solms 2013), is as much a 
result of that breakthrough as it is of psychological “working over” of it 
in the clinical study groups I have mentioned.
Although this article is addressed primarily to a psychoanalytic audi-
ence, it contains insights about the lived life of the mind, obtained by the 
psychoanalytic method, that can be “carried over” in the reverse direc-
tion, back to neuroscience (see Solms 2021). As Oliver Sacks (1984) once 
said: “Neuropsychology, like classical neurology, aims to be entirely 
objective, and its great power, its advances, come from just this. But a

living creature, and especially a human being, is first and last active—a 
subject, not an object. It is precisely the subject, the living ‘I,’ which is 
being excluded. Neuropsychology is admirable, but it excludes the 
psyche—it excludes the experiencing, active, living ‘I’” (p. 164).
