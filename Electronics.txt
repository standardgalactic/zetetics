1 Aim of This Textbook
The aim of this textbook is to explain the design and function of electronic circuits and
components. The text covers electronic circuit components, DC analysis, and AC analysis.
It should be useful to beginner hobbyists as well as beginner engineering students, teaching
both theory and practical applications.
It should be thought of as a companion project to the Wikipedia articles about electronics.
While Wikipedia covers many details about the technology used in electronics components
and related ﬁelds, the Electronics Wikibook covers a lot of the ”how-to” aspects that aren’t
covered in an encyclopedia. The book will focus on how to use the components to build
useful circuits.

2 Preface
2.1 Importance of Electronics
Electronics is the study and use of devices that control the ﬂow of electrons (or other
charged particles). These devices can be used to process information or perform tasks using
electromagnetic power.
Electronic circuits can be found in numerous household products, including such items
as telephones, computers, and CD players. Electronic devices have also allowed greatly
increased precision in scientiﬁc measurements.
Interest in the ﬁeld of electronics increased around 1900 and the advent of radio. Interest
reached an all-time high in the 1940s, 50s, 60s, with the invention of transistor radios,
the launch of Sputnik, and the science and math educational push to win the space race.
Interest in electronics as a hobby in the 1970s led to the advent of the personal computer
(PC).
Electronics have since seen a decline in hobbyist interest.
Electronics is now generally
studied as part of a college-level program in electrical engineering.
This book is an attempt at reviving the hobbyist mentality that made electronics so big in
the ﬁrst place, by making electronics concepts more accessible and giving practical knowl-
edge, as well as providing technical information for the student.

3 Charge and Coulomb’s Law
Two atoms are walking down the street. The ﬁrst atom says to the second atom ”I
think I lost an electron!” The second says ”Are you sure?” To which the ﬁrst states ”I’m
positive !”
3.1 Basic Understanding
Conductors
Materials which contain movable charges that can ﬂow with minimal resistance.
Insulators
Materials with few or no movable charges, or with charges which ﬂow with extremely high
resistance.
Semiconductors
Materials whose behavior ranges between that of a conductor and that of an insulator under
diﬀerent conditions. Their conducting behavior may be heavily dependent on temperature.
They are useful because we are able to change their conducting behavior to be dependent
on many other factors.
The Atom
An atom contains a positively charged nucleus and one or more negatively charged elec-
trons. The atom exists in three states: neutral, positively charged, and negatively charged.
A neutral atom has the same number of electrons and protons, a positively charged atom
has more protons than electrons and a negatively charged atom has more electrons than
protons.
(+) and (-) Ions
An ion is an atom that has an unequal number of electrons and protons. Ions are formed
when a neutral atom gains or loses electrons during a chemical reaction. In a battery, the
positive side has + ions, means there are fewer electrons than protons, giving it an overall
positive charge, and -ve side, more electrons than protons, giving it an overall negative
charge. +ve and -ve charge will attract each other, and it is the use of such an attractive
force that allows the battery to do work.
Note: Electric current is not the same as electron ﬂow as is widely mistaken. Firstly, the
total current has the opposite direction compared to electron ﬂow. This is a lucky ”mistake”
on our forefathers’ part to put it this way. It is also because of this lucky legacy that we
are reminded that electricity can ﬂow in materials other than metals alone. For example, in
7

Charge and Coulomb’s Law
water, it is not electrons that ﬂow, it is ions, and the +ve ions and -ve ions ﬂow in opposite
directions, contributing half of the total current each.
3.2 Balance of Charge
Atoms, the smallest particles of matter that retain the properties of the matter, are made
of protons1, electrons2, and neutrons3. Protons have a positive charge, Electrons have a
negative charge that cancels the proton’s positive charge. Neutrons are particles that are
similar to a proton but have a neutral charge. There are no diﬀerences between positive and
negative charges except that particles with the same charge repel each other and particles
with opposite charges attract each other. If a solitary positive proton and negative electron
are placed near each other they will come together to form a hydrogen atom. This repulsion
and attraction (force between stationary charged particles) is known as theElectrostatic
Force and extends theoretically to inﬁnity, but is diluted as the distance between particles
increases.
When an atom has one or more missing electrons it is left with a positive charge, and
when an atom has at least one extra electron it has a negative charge. Having a positive
or a negative charge makes an atom an ion .
Atoms only gain and lose protons and
neutrons through fusion4, ﬁssion5, and radioactive decay6. Although atoms are made of
many particles and objects are made of many atoms, they behave similarly to charged
particles in terms of how they repel and attract.
In an atom the protons and neutrons combine to form a tightly bound nucleus.
This
nucleus is surrounded by a vast cloud of electrons circling it at a distance but held near
the protons by electromagnetic attraction (the electrostatic force discussed earlier). The
cloud exists as a series of overlapping shells / bands in which the inner valence bands
are ﬁlled with electrons and are tightly bound to the atom. The outer conduction bands
contain no electrons except those that have accelerated to the conduction bands by gaining
energy. With enough energy an electron will escape an atom (compare with the escape
velocity of a space rocket). When an electron in the conduction band decelerates and falls
to another conduction band or the valence band a photon is emitted. This is known as the
photoelectric eﬀect .
A laser is formed when electrons travel back and forth between conduction bands emitting
synchronized photons.
1. When the conduction and valence bands overlap, the atom is a conductor and allows
for the free movement of electrons. Conductors are metals and can be thought of as
a bunch of atomic nuclei surrounded by a churning ”sea of electrons”.

Conductors
2. When there is a large energy level gap between the conduction and valence bands,
the atom is an insulator ; it traps electrons. Many insulators are non-metals and are
good at blocking the ﬂow of electrons.
3. When there is a small energy level gap between the conduction and valence bands, the
atom is a semiconductor . Semiconductors behave like conductors and insulators,
and work using the conduction and valence bands. The electrons in the outer valence
band are known as holes . They behave like positive charges because of how they ﬂow.
In semiconductors electrons collide with the material and their progress is halted. This
makes the electrons have an eﬀective mass that is less than their normal mass. In
some semiconductors holes have a larger eﬀective mass than the conduction electrons.
Electronic devices are based on the idea of exploiting the diﬀerences between conductors,
insulators, and semiconductors but also exploit known physical phenomena such as electro-
magnetism and phosphorescence.
3.3 Conductors
In a metal the electrons of an object are free to move from atom to atom. Due to their mutual
repulsion (calculable via Coulomb’s Law 7), the valence electrons are forced from the centre
of the object and spread out evenly across its surface in order to be as far apart as possible.
This cavity of empty space is known as a Faraday Cage and stops electromagnetic
radiation , such as charge, radio waves, and EMP 8s (Electro-Magnetic Pulses) from
entering and leaving the object. If there are holes in the Faraday Cage then radiation can
pass.
One of the interesting things to do with conductors is demonstrate the transfer of charge
between metal spheres. Start by taking two identical and uncharged metal spheres which
are each suspended by insulators (such as a pieces of string). The ﬁrst step involves putting
sphere 1 next to but not touching sphere 2. This causes all the electrons in sphere 2 to travel
away from sphere 1 to the far end of sphere 2. So sphere 2 now has a negative end ﬁlled
with electrons and a positive end lacking electrons. Next sphere 2 is grounded by contact
with a conductor connected with the earth and the earth takes its electrons leaving sphere
2 with a positive charge. The positive charge (absence of electrons) spreads evenly across
the surface due to its lack of electrons. If suspended by strings, the relatively negatively
charged sphere 1 will attract the relatively positively charged sphere 2.
3.4 Insulators
In an insulator the charges of a material are stuck and cannot ﬂow. This allows an imbalance
of charge to build up on the surface of the object by way of the triboelectric eﬀect. The
triboelectric eﬀect (rubbing electricity eﬀect) involves the exchange of electrons when two
diﬀerent insulators such as glass, hard rubber, amber, or even the seat of one’s trousers,
come into contact. The polarity and strength of the charges produced diﬀer according to

9

Charge and Coulomb’s Law
the material composition and its surface smoothness. For example, glass rubbed with silk
will build up a charge, as will hard rubber rubbed with fur. The eﬀect is greatly enhanced
by rubbing materials together.
• Van de GraaﬀGenerator: A charge pump (pump for electrons) that generates static
electricity. In a Van de Graaﬀgenerator, a conveyor belt uses rubbing to pick up electrons,
which are then deposited on metal brushes. The end result is a charge diﬀerence.
Because the material being rubbed is now charged, contact with an uncharged object or an
object with the opposite charge may cause a discharge of the built-up static electricity
by way of a spark. A person simply walking across a carpet may build up enough charge
to cause a spark to travel over a centimetre. The spark is powerful enough to attract dust
particles to cloth, destroy electrical equipment, ignite gas fumes, and create lightning. In
extreme cases the spark can destroy factories that deal with gunpowder and explosives. The
best way to remove static electricity is by discharging it through grounding. Humid air will
also slowly discharge static electricity. This is one reason cells9 and capacitors10 lose charge
over time.
Note: The concept of an insulator changes depending on the applied voltage. Air looks like
an insulator when a low voltage is applied. But it breaks down as an insulator, becomes
ionised, at about ten kilovolts per centimetre. A person could put their shoe across the
terminals of a car battery and it would look like an insulator. But putting a shoe across a
ten kilovolt powerline will cause a short.

Quantity of Charge
3.5 Quantity of Charge
Protons and electrons have opposite but equal charge. Because in almost all cases, the
charge on protons or electrons is the smallest amount of charge commonly discussed, the
quantity of charge of one proton is considered one positive elementary charge and the
charge of one electron is one negative elementary charge .
Because atoms and such
particles are so small, and charge in amounts of multi-trillions of elementary charges are
usually discussed, a much larger unit of charge is typically used. The coulomb is a unit
of charge, which can be expressed as a positive or negative number, which is equal to
approximately 6.2415×1018 elementary charges. Accordingly, an elementary charge is equal
to approximately 1.602×10-19 coulombs. The commonly used abbreviation for the coulomb
is a capital C . The SI11 deﬁnition of a coulomb is the quantity of charge which passes a
point over a period of 1 second ( s ) when a current of 1 ampere12 (A) ﬂows past that point,
i.e., C = A·s or A = C/s. You may ﬁnd it helpful during later lessons to retain this picture
in your mind (even though you may not recall the exact number). An ampere13 is one of
the fundamental units in physics from which various other units are deﬁned, such as the
coulomb.
3.6 Force between Charges: Coulomb’s Law
The repulsive or attractive electrostatic force between charges decreases as the charges
are located further from each other by the square of the distance between them. An equation
called Coulomb’s law determines the electrostatic force between two charged objects. The
following picture shows a charge q at a certain point with another charge Q at a distance
of r away from it. The presence of Q causes an electrostatic force to be exerted on q .
Figure 13
The magnitude of the electrostatic force F , on a charge q , due to another charge Q , equals
Coulomb’s constant multiplied by the product of the two charges (in coulombs) divided
by the square of the distance r , between the charges q and Q . Here a capital Q and small q

Charge and Coulomb’s Law
are scalar14 quantities used for symbolizing the two charges, but other symbols such as q 1
and q 2 have been used in other sources. These symbols for charge were used for consistency
with the electric ﬁeld15 article in Wikipedia and are consistent with the Reference below.
F = kqQ
r2
F = magnitude of electrostatic force on charge q due to another charge Q
r = distance (magnitude quantity in above equation) between q and Q
k = Coulomb’s constant = 8.9875×109 N·m2/C2 in free space
The value of Coulomb’s constant given here is such that the preceding Coulomb’s Law
equation will work if both q and Q are given in units of coulombs, r in metres, and F in
newtons and there is no dielectric material between the charges. A dielectric material
is one that reduces the electrostatic force when placed between charges.
Furthermore,
Coulomb’s constant can be given by:
k =
1
4πϵ
where ϵ = permittivity . When there is no dielectric material between the charges (for
example, in free space or a vacuum),
ϵ0
= 8.85419 × 10-12 C2/(N·m2).
Air is only very weakly dielectric and the value above for ϵ0 will work well enough with air
between the charges. If a dielectric material is present, then
ϵ = κϵ0
where κ is the dielectric constant which depends on the dielectric material. In a vacuum
(free space), κ = 1 and thus ϵ = ϵ0. For air, κ = 1.0006. Typically, solid insulating materials
have values of κ > 1 and will reduce electric force between charges. The dielectric constant
can also be called relative permittivity , symbolized as ϵr in Wikipedia16.

Force between Charges: Coulomb’s Law
Highly charged particles close to each other exert heavy forces on each other; if the charges
are less or they are farther apart, the force is less. As the charges move far enough apart,
their eﬀect on each other becomes negligible.
Any force on an object is a vector17 quantity. Vector quantities such as forces are charac-
terized by a numerical magnitude (i. e. basically the size of the force) and a direction. A
vector is often pictured by an arrow pointing in the direction. In a force vector, the direction
is the one in which the force pulls the object. The symbol ⃗F is used here for the electric
force vector. If charges q and Q are either both positive or both negative, then they will
repel each other. This means the direction of the electric force ⃗F on q due to Q is away from
Q in exactly the opposite direction, as shown by the red arrow in the preceding diagram.
If one of the charges is positive and the other negative, then they will attract each other.
This means that the direction of ⃗F on q due to Q is exactly in the direction towards Q , as
shown by the blue arrow in the preceding diagram. The Coulomb’s equation shown above
will give a magnitude for a repulsive force away from the Q charge. A property of a vector is
that if its magnitude is negative, the vector will be equal to a vector with an equivalent but
positive magnitude and exactly the opposite direction. So, if the magnitude given by the
above equation is negative due to opposite charges, the direction of the resulting force will
be directly opposite of away from Q , meaning the force will be towards Q , an attractive
force. In other sources, diﬀerent variations of Coulombs’ Law are given, including vector
formulas in some cases (see Wikipedia link and reference(s) below).
In many situations, there may be many charges, Q 1, Q 2, Q 3, through Qn , on the charge
q in question. Each of the Q 1 through Qn charges will exert an electric force on q . The
direction of the force depends on the location of the surrounding charges. A Coulomb’s
Law calculation between q and a corresponding Q i charge would give the magnitude of the
electric force exerted by each of the Q i charges for i = 1 through n , but the direction of
each of the component forces must also be used to determine the individual force vectors,
⃗F1, ⃗F2, ⃗F3,...., ⃗Fn. To determine the total electric force on q , the electric force contributions
from each of these charges add up as vector quantities, not just like ordinary (or scalar)
numbers.
⃗Fe = ⃗F1 + ⃗F2 + ⃗F3 +.....+ ⃗Fn
The total electric force on q is additive to any other forces aﬀecting it, but all of the forces
are to be added together as vectors to obtain the total force on the charged object q .
In many cases, there are billions of electrons or other charges present, so that geometrical
distributions of charges are used with equations stemming from Coulomb’s Law. Practically
speaking, such calculations are usually of more interest to a physicist than an electrician,
electrical engineer, or electronics hobbyist, so they will not be discussed much more in this
book, except in the section on capacitors.
In addition to the electrostatic forces described here, electromagnetic forces are created
when the charges are moving. These will be described later.

4 Basic Concepts
4.1 What is Electronics?
Electronics is the study of ﬂow of electrons in various materials or space subjected to various
conditions. In the past, electronics dealt with the study of Vacuum Tubes or Thermionic
valves, today it mainly deals with ﬂow of electrons in semiconductors. However, despite
these technological diﬀerences, the main focus of electronics remains the controlled ﬂow
of electrons through a medium. By controlling the ﬂow of electrons, we can make them
perform special tasks, such as power an induction motor or heat a resistive coil.
Plumbing Analogy A simple way to understand electrical circuits is to think of them as
pipes. Let’s say you have a simple circuit with a voltage source and a resistor between the
positive and negative terminals on the source. When the circuit is powered, electrons will
move from the negative terminal, through the resistor, and into the positive terminal. The
resistor is basically a path of conduction that resists the movement of electrons. This circuit
could also be represented as a plumbing network. In the plumbing network, the resistor
would be equivalent to a section of pipe, where the water is forced to move around several
barriers to pass through, eﬀectively slowing its ﬂow. If the pipe is level, no water will ﬂow
in an organized fashion, since the pressure is equal throughout the pipe. However, if we tilt
the pipe to a vertical position (similar to turning on a voltage source), a pressure diﬀerence
is created (similar to a voltage diﬀerence) and the water begins ﬂowing through the pipe.
This ﬂow of water is similar to the ﬂow of electrons in a circuit.
4.2 Electricity
To understand electronics, you need to understand electricity and what it is. Basically,
electricity is the ﬂow of electrons due to a diﬀerence in electrical charge between two points.
This diﬀerence in charge is created due to a diﬀerence in electron density. If you have a
point where the electron density is higher than the electron density at another point, the
electrons in the area of higher density will want to balance the charge by migrating towards
the area with lower density. This migration is referred to as electrical current. Thus, ﬂow
in an electrical circuit is induced by putting more electrons on one side of the circuit than
the other, forcing them to move through the circuit to balance the charge density.
4.3 Electric Charge
In normal conditions all matter has a neutral or has a zero net charge. When an object
receives an electron the object becomes negatively charged. When an object gives up an
15

Basic Concepts
electron the object becomes positively charged. Each charge possesses electric ﬁeld lines and
charge quantities. A positive charge possesses charge quantities of +Q and has electric ﬁeld
lines going outward. A negative charge possesses charge quantities of -Q and has electric
ﬁeld lines going inward. In general, like charges will oppose each other and opposite charges
will attract each other. Hence, it is a property of matter.
4.3.1 Coulomb’s Law
The force of attraction between two charges can be calculated by Coulomb’s Law. Below
would be the calculation between a positive and negative charge.
F = kQ+.Q−
r2
4.3.2 Ampere’s Law
The electric force, F, on a charge, Q, within an electric ﬁeld, E, are related by Ampere’s
Law. On an atomic basis, this is the force that gives rise to current.
F = EQ
4.3.3 Lorentz’s Law
When a charge in motion passes through a magnetic ﬁeld. The magnetic ﬁeld will push a
positive charge upward and negative charge downward in the direction perpendicular to the
initial direction traveled. The magnetic force on the charge is calculated by Lorennt’s Law
F = QvB
F = −QvB
4.3.4 ElectroMagnetic Force
The sum of Ampere’s Force and Lorentz’s Force exert on a charge is called EletroMagnetic
Force
F = F +F = QE +QvB = Q(E +vB)
F = F +F = QE −QvB = Q(E −vB)
16

Electricity and Matter
4.4 Electricity and Matter
All matter interacts with Electricity, and are divided into three categories: Conductors,
Semi Conductors, and Non Conductors.
Conductor1
Matter that conducts Electricity easily. Metals like Zinc (Zn) and Copper (Cu) conduct
electricity very easily. Therefore, they are used to make Conductors.
Non-Conductor2
Matter that does not conduct Electricity at all. Non-Metals like Wood and Rubber do not
conduct electricity so easily. Therefore, they are used to make Non-Conductors.
Semi Conductor3
Matter that conducts electricity in a manner between that of Conductors and Non-
Conductors. For example, Silicon (Si) and Germanium (Ge) conduct electricity better
than non-conductors but worse than conductors. Therefore, they are used to make Semi
Conductors.
4.5 Electricity and Conductors
Normally, all conductors have a zero net charge . If there is an electric force that exerts a
pressure on the charges in the conductor to force charges to move in a straight line result
in a stream of electric charge moving in a straight line
4.5.1 Voltage
The pressure the electric force exert on the charges is called voltage denoted as V measured
in Volt (V) and deﬁned as the ratio of Work Done on Charge
V = W

V = P

4.5.2 Current
The moving of straight lines of electric charges in the conductor is called current denoted
as I measured in Ampere (A) and deﬁned as Charge ﬂow through an area in a unit of time

Generally, resistance of any conductor is found to increase with increasing temperature
For Conductor
R = Ro(1 + nT)
For Semi Conductor
R = Ro enT
When a conductor conducts electricity, it dissipates heat energy into the surrounding . This
results in a loss of electric energy transmitted . If the electric supply energy is PV and the
electric loss energy is PR Then the electric energy delivered:
P = PV - PR
P = IV −I2R = IV −V 2

P = I(V −IR) = V (I −V

Cells
• Cell: Two materials with a voltage diﬀerence between them. This causes current to ﬂow,
which does work. Electrons travel from the cathode, do some work, and are absorbed by
the anode.
• Anode: Destination of electrons.
• Cathode: Source of electrons.
• ions: An atom with an imbalance of electrons.
• cell operation: The cell runs and electrons are depleted at the cathode and accumulate
at the anode. This creates a reverse voltage which stops the ﬂow of electrons.
• irreversible: At some point the voltage diﬀerence reactions between the cathode and
anode will decrease to a point that the cell in unusable. At this point, in an irreversible
cell, the voltage diﬀerence is irreplaceably lost, and the cell is of no further use.
• reversible: Able to run the cell backwards.
• rechargeable: In a rechargeable cell, when the voltage diﬀerence between the cathode and
anode decreases, the cell can be recharged, thereby increasing the voltage diﬀerence to a
suitable level to allow continued use.
humid air will discharge cells.
cells are usually made of toxic or corrosive substances, for example lead and sulphuric acid.
Such substances have been known to explode.
• Electronegativity http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronegativity
What is the relationship between voltage and electronegativity?
Electronegativity is a concept in chemistry used to measure and predict the relative likeli-
hood of a chemical reaction causing electrons to shift from one chemical to another resulting
in ions and molecular bonds. A battery cell operates by allowing two chemicals to react
and supply ions to the anode and cathode. When the supply of a reactant is consumed,
the battery is dead. It no longer produces diﬀerent electrical potential at the anode and
cathode driven by the chemical reaction.
Voltage is the electrical potential of a point due to surrounding measurable electric charge
distributions and points as calculated by application Coulomb’s Law. Voltage diﬀerence
between two points connected by a conductor results in electron ﬂow.

6 Resistors
6.1 Resistor
Figure 15
A resistor is a block or material that limits the ﬂow of current. The greater the resistance,
the lower the current will be, assuming the same voltage imposed on the resistor. The
hydraulic analogy of a resistor would be the pipe with water ﬂowing through it. The wider
the diameter of a pipe, the higher the water ﬂow through the pipe, assuming the same
pressure diﬀerence on the terminals of a pipe.

Resistors
6.2 Resistor’s Symbol
Resistors have two leads (points of contact) to which the resistor can be connected to an
electrical circuit. A symbol for a resistor used in electrical circuit diagrams is shown below.
The endpoints at the left and right sides of the symbol indicate the points of contact for the
resistor. The ratio of the voltage to current will always be positive, since a higher voltage
on one side of a resistor is a positive voltage, and a current will ﬂow from the positive side
to the negative side, resulting in a positive current. If the voltage is reversed, the current
is reversed, leading again to a positive resistance.
6.3 Resistance
Resistance is a characteristic of Resistor indicates the measurement of current opposition .
Resistance has a symbol R measured in Ohm (Ω) . The ratio of voltage to current is referred
to as Ohm’s Law, and is one of the most basic laws that govern electronics.
R = V
I
An ohm is the amount of resistance which passes one ampere of current when a one volt
potential is placed across it. (The ohm is actually deﬁned as the resistance which dissipates
one watt of power when one ampere of current is passed through it.)
1Ω= 1 V
1 A
Resistance can vary from very small to very large. A superconductor has zero resistance,
while something like the input to an op-amp can have a resistance near 1012 Ω, and even
higher resistances are possible.
6.3.1 Resistance and Temperature
For most materials, resistance increases with increasing Temperature
For Conductor . R = Ro(1+nT)
For Semi Conductor . R = RoenT
6.3.2 Resistance and Electric Power Loss
Resistance converts Electrical Energy into Heat this causes Electric Energy Loss.

6.4 Resistor’s Labeling (See also Identiﬁcation)
A manufactured resistor is usually labeled with the nominal value (value to be manufactured
to) and sometimes a tolerance. Rectangular resistors will usually contain numbers that
indicate a resistance and a multiplier. If there are three or four numbers on the resistor,
the ﬁrst numbers are a resistance value, and the last number refers to the number of zeroes
in the multiplier. If there is an R in the value, the R takes the place of the decimal point.
Examples
2003 means 200×103 = 200kΩ
600 means 60×100 = 60Ω
2R5 means 2.5Ω
R01 means 0.01Ω
Cylindrical resistors (axial) usually have colored bands that indicate a number and a multi-
plier. Resistance bands are next to each other, with a tolerance band slightly farther away
from the resistance bands. Starting from the resistance band side of the resistor, each colour
represents a number in the same fashion as the number system shown above.

6.5 Resistor’s Construction
The resistance R of a component is dependent on its physical dimension and can be calcu-
lated using:
R = ρL
A
where
ρ is the electrical resistivity (resistance to electricity) of the material,
L is the length of the material
A is the cross-sectional area of the material.
If you increase ρ or L you increase the resistance of the material, but if you increase A you
decrease the resistance of the material.
6.5.1 Resistivity of the Material
Every material has its own resistivity, depending on its physical makeup. Most metals are
conductors and have very low resistivity; whereas, insulators such as rubber, wood, and air
all have very high resistivity. The inverse of resistivity is conductivity, which is measured
in units of Siemens/metre (S/m) or, equivalently. mhos/metre.
In the following chart, it is not immediately obvious how the unit ohm-meter is selected.
Considering a solid block of the material to be tested, one can readily see that the resistance
of the block will decrease as its cross-sectional area increases (thus widening the conceptual
”pipe”), and will increase as the length of the block increases (lengthening the ”pipe”).
Given a ﬁxed length, the resistance will increase as the cross-sectional area decreases; the
resistance, multiplied by the area, will be a constant. If the cross-sectional area is held
constant, as the length is increased, the resistance increases in proportion, so the resistance
divided by the length is similarly a constant. Thus the bulk resistance of a material is
typically measured in ohm meters squared per meter, which simpliﬁes to ohm - meter (Ω-
m).

Silver, copper, gold, and aluminum are popular materials for wires, due to low resistivity.
Silicon and germanium are used as semiconductors. Glass, rubber, quartz crystal, and air
are popular dielectrics, due to high resistivity.
Many materials, such as air, have a non-linear resistance curve. Normal undisturbed air
has a high resistance, but air with a high enough voltage applied will become ionized and
conduct very easily.
The resistivity of a material also depends on its temperature.
Normally, the hotter an
object is, the more resistance it has. At high temperatures, the resistance is proportional
to the absolute temperature. At low temperatures, the formula is more complicated, and
what counts as a high or low temperature depends on what the resistor is made from. In
some materials the resistivity drops to zero below a certain temperature. This is known as
superconductivity, and has many useful applications.
(Some materials, such as silicon, have less resistance at higher temperatures.)
For all resistors, the change in resistance for a small increase in temperature is directly
proportional to the change in temperature.
Current passing through a resistor will warm it up. Many components have heat sinks to
dissipate that heat. The heatsink keeps the component from melting or setting something
on ﬁre.
29

Resistors
6.5.2 Length
The length of an object is directly proportional to its resistance. As shown in the diagram
below, 1 unit cubed of material has 1 ohm of resistance. However, when 4 units are stacked
lengthwise and a connection is made to the front and back sides respectively, the total
resistance is 4 ohms. This is because the length of the unit is 4, whereas the cross-sectional
area remains 1. However, if you were to make connections on the sides, the exact opposite
would be true: the cross-sectional area would be 4 and the length 1, resulting in 0.25 ohms
total resistance.
Figure 17
6.5.3 Cross-Sectional Area
Increasing area is the same as having resistors in parallel, so as you increase the area you
add more paths for current to take.
The resistance of a material is inversely proportional to its cross-sectional area. This is
shown in the diagram below, where 1 unit cubed has one ohm of resistance. However, if 4
units cubed are stacked on top of each other in the fashion such that there is 4 units squared
of cross-sectional area, and the electrical connections are made to the front and back such
that the connections are on the largest sides, the resultant resistance would be 0.25 ohms.
Additional note: There are two reasons why a small cross-sectional area tends to raise
resistance. One is that the electrons, all having the same negative charge, repel each other.
Thus there is resistance to many being forced into a small space.
The other reason is
that they collide, causing ”scattering,” and therefore they are diverted from their original
directions. (More discussion is on page 27 of ”Industrial Electronics,” by D. J. Shaneﬁeld,
Noyes Publications, Boston, 2001.)

6.5.4 Example
For instance, if you wanted to calculate the resistance of a 1 cm high, 1 cm wide, 5 cm deep
block of copper, as shown in the diagram below:
31

Resistors
Figure 19
You would ﬁrst need to decide how it’s oriented. Suppose you want to use it from front
to back (lengthwise), like a piece of wire, with electrical contacts on the front and rear
faces. Next you need to ﬁnd the length, L. As shown, it is 5 cm long (0.05 m). Then, we
look up the resistivity of copper on the table, 1.6×10-8 Ω-meters. Lastly, we calculate the
cross-sectional area of the conductor, which is 1 cm × 1 cm = 1 cm2 (0.0001 m2). Then,
we put it all in the formula, converting cm to m:
0.05 m·1.6×10−8 Ω·m
0.0001 m2
= 0.08×10−8 Ω·m2
0.0001 m2
units m2 cancel:
0.08×10−8 Ω
0.0001

Resistor Connection
Which, after evaluating, gives you a ﬁnal value of 8.0×10-6 Ω, or 8 microohms, a very small
resistance. The method shown above included the units to demonstrate how the units cancel
out, but the calculation will work as long as you use consistent units.

verting units. This example can be calculated with this link: http://www.google.com/

6.5.5 Properties of the material
• Wirewound : Used for power resistors, since the power per volume ratio is highest.
These usually have the lowest noise.
• Carbon Film : These are easy to produce, but usually have lots of noise because of the
properties of the material.
• Metal Film : These resistors have thermal and voltage noise attributes that are between
carbon and wirewound.
• Ceramic : Useful for high frequency applications.
6.6 Resistor Connection
6.6.1 Resistors in Series
Figure 20
Resistors in series are equivalent to having one long resistor. If the properties of two resistors
are equivalent, except the length, the ﬁnal resistance will be the sum of the two construction
methods:
REQ = ρLEQ
A
= ρL1
A + ρL2
A
This means that the resistors add when in series.
REQ = R1 +R2 +···+Rn
• Christmas tree lights are usually connected in series, with the unfortunate eﬀect that
if one light blows, the others will all go out (This happens because the circuit is not
complete, if a circuit is not complete then the current cannot ﬂow, hence the light bulbs
33

Resistors
all go out). However, most modern Christmas light strings have built in shunt resistors
in parallel to the bulb, so that current will ﬂow past the blown light bulb.
6.6.2 Resistors in Parallel
Figure 21
In a parallel circuit, current is divided among multiple paths. This means that two resistors
in parallel have a lower equivalent resistance than either of the parallel resistors, since both
resistors allow current to pass. Two resistors in parallel will be equivalent to a resistor that
is twice as wide:
REQ = ρL
AEQ
= ρL
A1
+ ρL
A2
Since conductances (the inverse of resistance) add in parallel, you get the following equation:
1
REQ
= 1
R1
+ 1
R2
+···+ 1
Rn
For example, two 4 Ωresistors in parallel have an equivalent resistance of only 2 Ω.
To simplify mathematical equations, resistances in parallel can be represented with two
vertical lines ”||” (as in geometry). For two resistors the parallel formula simpliﬁes to:
REQ = R1∥R2 =
R1R2
R1 +R2
34

Resistor Connection
6.6.3 Combinations of series and parallel
Figure 22
Resistors in parallel are evaluated as if in a mathematical set of ”parentheses.” The most
basic group of resistors in parallel is evaluated ﬁrst, then the group in series with the new
equivalent resistor, then the next group of resistors in parallel, and so on. For example, the
above portion would be evaluated as follows:
REQ = (R1∥R2)+R3 =
R1R2
R1 +R2
+R3

Resistors
6.7 Resistor variations
• Variable Resistor or Potentiometer
Variable resistors are tunable, meaning you can turn a dial or slide a contact and change
the resistance. They are used as knobs to control the volume of a stereo, or as a dimmer
for a lamp. The term Potentiometer is often abbreviated as ’pot’. It is constructed like a
resistor, but has a sliding tap contact. Potentiometers are used as Voltage Dividers1. It
is rare to ﬁnd a variable resistor with only two leads. Most are potentiometers with three
leads, even if one is not connected to anything.
• Rheostat
A variation of the potentiostat with a high current rating, which is used to control the
amount of power going through a load, such as a motor.
• Thermistor
Temperature-sensitive resistor, in which the resistance decreases as the temperature rises.
They are used in ﬁre alarms, so if things get too hot the current rises and trips a switch
that sounds an alarm.
• LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) or Photoresistor
A resistor which changes values depending on the amount of light shining on its surface.
The resistance decreases as the amount of light increases. They are used in street lamps,
so when it gets dark the current decreases and turns on the street lamp.
6.8 Applications
• Voltage division / Attenuation : Sometimes a voltage will be too large to measure,
so a means to linearly reduce the voltage is required. Placing two resistors in series to
ground will provide a point in the middle to tap. Resistor RA is placed between the input
voltage and the output node, and the resistor RB is placed between the output node
and ground. This creates a voltage divider to lessen the output voltage. Typically, the
resistors are near the value of ˜10kΩ. The Thevenin model of the circuit gives an output
resistance ROUT = RA||RB. A larger output resistance will more likely be aﬀected by the
input resistance of the measuring circuit (this is a desired eﬀect in the transistor biasing
circuits). Placement of the voltage divider should be close to the measuring circuit, to
minimize noise (in this arrangement, it will be also lessened Rb/(Ra + Rb) times). The
output voltage of the voltage divider is
Voutput =
RB
RA +RB
Vinput
• Pull-up / Pull-down : If there is nothing to drive a signal node, the node will be
left ”ﬂoating” (for example, such a situation occurs at the trigger input of a car alarm
system when the driver has switched oﬀthe internal lamp). This may lead to unintended

36

Applications
values being measured, or causing side-eﬀects when the voltage is propagated down the
remainder of the circuit. To prevent this, a relatively high value resistor (usually ˜10kΩ
to ˜1MΩ) is placed between the node and ground (pull-down) or a high voltage (pull-
up) to bring the voltage of the ”ﬂoating” node near to the voltage it is being pulled. A
resistive voltage divider is another example where the upper resistor ”pulls” the output
point up toward the input voltage while the lower resistor ”pulls” the output point toward
the ground. This idea is evolved in the circuit of a resistive voltage summer (for example,
the resistors R1 and R2 of an op-amp inverting ampliﬁer) supplied by two voltages (VIN
and -VOUT) having opposite polarities. The two voltage sources ”pull” the output point
in opposite directions; as a result, if R2/R1 = -VOUT/VIN, the point becomes a virtual
ground. Placement of a pull-up or pull-down resistor does not have a signiﬁcant eﬀect on
the performance of the circuit, if they have high resistances.
• Current limiting / Isolation : In order to protect circuits from conditions that may
cause too much current in a device, a current limiting resistor is inserted in the middle
of the circuit. A digital input to a microcontroller may beneﬁt from a current limiting
resistor. The inputs to modern microcontrollers have protection circuitry built in that
will protect the input from an overvoltage condition, provided that the current is small
enough. For instance, a common microcontroller will be capable of withstanding 20mA.
If there are 12V nets on a circuit board, or in a system, the digital input will beneﬁt
from a 350Ωresistor (refer to calculation below). Usually a slightly larger resistance is
used in practice, but too large of a resistor will cause noise, and may prevent the input
from being able to read the voltage. It is good practice to place the resistor as close as
possible to the microcontroller input, so that an accidental short on the board will mean
that the microcontroller input is likely still protected.
R = 12V
20mA = 600Ω
• Line termination / Impedance matching : The properties of an electric wave prop-
agating through a conductor (such as a wire) create a reﬂection, which can be viewed
as unwanted noise.
A reﬂection can be eliminated by maximizing the power transfer
between the conductor and the termination resistor. By matching the resistance (more
importantly the impedance ), the wave will not cause a reﬂection. The voltage of the
echo V_r is calculated below in reference to the original signal V_o as a function of the
conductor impedance Z_C and the terminator impedance Z_T. As the name implies,
the termination resistor goes at the end of the conductor.
Vr = Vo
ZC −ZT
ZC +ZT
• Current sensing : Measurement of a current cannot be done directly. There are three
major ways to measure a current: a resistor, a hall sensor, and an inductor. The hall
sensor and inductor use a property of the magnetic ﬁeld to sense the current through a
nearby conductor. According to Ohm’s law, if a current I ﬂows through a resistor R, a
voltage V = R.I appears across the resistor. Therefore, the resistor can act as a passive
current-to-voltage converter. In this arrangement, the resistor should have a very low
value (sometimes on the order of ˜0.01Ω), so it does not aﬀect the current ﬂow or heat
up; however, a smaller value has a lower voltage to read, which means more noise may
37

Resistors
be introduced. This contradiction is solved in the circuit of an active current-to-voltage
converter where the resistor may have a signiﬁcant resistance as an op-amp compensates
the ”undesired” voltage drop across it (unfortunately, this remedy may be applied only
in low-current measurements). The current sense resistor should be placed as close as
possible to where the measurement occurs, in order not to disturb the circuit.
• Filtering : Filtering is discussed later, after an introduction to capacitors and inductors.
Filters are best placed close to where measurement takes place.
6.9 Speciﬁcations
Resistors are available as pre-fabricated, real-world components.
The behavior of such
components deviates from an ideal resistor in certain ways. Therefore, real-world resistors
are not only speciﬁed by their resistance, but also by other parameters. In order to select
a manufactured resistance, the entire range of speciﬁcations should be considered. Usually,
exact values do not need to be known, but ranges should be determined.
6.9.1 Nominal Resistance
The nominal resistance is the resistance that can be expected when ordering a resistor.
Finding a range for the resistance is necessary, especially when operating on signals. Re-
sistors do not come in all of the values that will be necessary. Sometimes resistor values
can be manipulated by shaving oﬀparts of a resistor (in industrial environments this is
sometimes done with a LASER to adjust a circuit), or by combining several resistors in
series and parallel.
Available resistor values typically come with a resistance value from a so called resistor
series. Resistor series are sets of standard, predeﬁned resistance values. The values are
actually made up from a geometric sequence within each decade. In every decade there
are supposed to be n resistance values, with a constant step factor. The standard resistor
values within a decade are derived by using the step factor i
i =
n√
10;n = 6,12,24,48
rounded to a two digit precision. Resistor series are named En, according to the used value
of n in the above formula.

rounding the following 12 values:

Speciﬁcations
1.00, 1.20, 1.50, 1.80, 2.20, 2.70,
3.30, 3.90, 4.70, 5.60, 6.80, and 8.20
and actually available resistors from the E12 series are for example resistors with a nominal
value of 120Ω or 4.7kΩ.
6.9.2 Tolerances
A manufactured resistor has a certain tolerance to which the resistance may diﬀer from the
nominal value. For example, a 2kΩresistor may have a tolerance of ±5%, leaving a resistor
with a value between 1.9kΩand 2.1kΩ(i.e. 2kΩ±100Ω). The tolerance must be accounted
for when designing circuits. A circuit with an absolute voltage of 5V±0.0V in a voltage
divider network with two resistors of 2kΩ±5% will have a resultant voltage of 5V±10% (i.e.
5V±0.1V). The ﬁnal resistor tolerances are found by taking the derivative of the resistor
values, and plugging the absolute deviations into the resulting equation.
The above mentioned E-series which are used to provide standardized nominal resistance
values, are also coupled to standardized nominal tolerances.
The fewer steps within a
decade there are, the larger the allowed tolerance of a resistor from such a series is. More
precises resistors, outside of the mentioned E-series are also available, e.g. for high-precision
measurement equipment. Common tolerances, colors and key characters used to identify
them are for example:

Resistor manufacturers can beneﬁt from this standardization. They manufacture resistors
ﬁrst, and afterwards they measure them. If a resistor does not meet the nominal value
within the deﬁned tolerance of one E-series, it might still ﬁt into a lower series, and doesn’t
have to be thrown away, but can be sold as being compliant to that lower E-series standard.
Although typically at a lower price.
Series : Resistors that combine in series add the nominal tolerances together.
Derivation: dRT = dRA +dRB
Example: For two resistors in series RA = 1.5kΩ±130Ωand RB = 500Ω±25Ω, the tolerance
is 130Ω+ 25Ω, resulting in a ﬁnal resistor value RT = 2kΩ±155Ω.

more complex.

6.9.3 Power Rating
Because the purpose of a resistor is to dissipate power in the form of heat, the resistor has
a rating (in watts) at which the resistor can continue to dissipate before the temperature
overwhelms the resistor and causes it to overheat. When a resistor overheats, the material
begins to melt away, which will cause the resistance to increase (usually), until the resistor
breaks.
6.9.4 Operating Temperature
Related to power rating, the operating temperature is the temperature that the resistor can
continue to operate before being destroyed.
6.9.5 Maximum Voltage
In order to avoid sparkovers or material breakdown a certain maximum voltage over a
resistor must not be exceeded. The maximum voltage is part of a resistor’s speciﬁcation,
and typically a function of the resistor’s physical length, distance of the leads, material and
coating.
For example, a resistor with a maximum operating voltage of 1kV can have a length in the
area of 2”, while a 0.3” resistor can operate under up to several tens of volts, probably up to
a hundred volts. When working with dangerous voltages it is essential to check the actual
speciﬁcation of a resistor, instead of only trusting it because of the length.
6.9.6 Temperature Coeﬃcient
This parameter refers to the constant in which the resistance changes per degree Celsius
(units in C-1). The change in temperature is not linear over the entire range of tempera-
tures, but can usually be thought of as linear around a certain range (usually around room
temperature). However, the resistance should be characterized over a large range if the
resistor is to be used as a thermistor in those ranges. The simpliﬁed linearized formula for
the aﬀect on temperature to a resistor is expressed in an equation:
R = R0[1+α(T −T0)]
6.9.7 Capacity and Inductance
Real world resistors not only show the physical property of resistance, but also have a certain
capacity and inductance. These properties start to become important, if a resistor is used
in some high frequency circuitry. Wire wound resistors, for example, show an inductance
which typically make them unusable above 1kHz.

6.9.8 Packaging
Resistors can be packaged in any way possible, but are divided into surface mount, through
hole, soldering tag and a few more forms. Surface mount is connected to the same side
that the resistor is on. Through hole resistors have leads (wires) that typically go through
the circuit board and are soldered to the board on the side opposite the resistor, hence the
name. Resistors with leads are also used in point-to-point circuits without circuit boards.
Soldering tag resistors have lugs to solder wires or high current connectors onto.
Usual packages for surface mount resistors are rectangular, referenced by a length and
a width in mils (thousands of an inch). For instance, an 0805 resistor is a rectangle with
length .08” x .05”, with contacts (metal that connects to the resistor) on either side. Typical
through hole resistors are cylindrical, referenced either by the length (such as 0.300”) or by
a typical power rating that is common to the length (a 1/4W resistor is typically 0.300”).
This length does not include the length of the leads.

Capacitors
Capacitors are a good example of the fact that even the simplest device can
become complicated given 250 years of evolution.
(Citation J. Ho, T. R. Jow, St.
Boggs, Historical Introduction to Capacitor Technology)1
Capacitors , together with resistors, inductors and memristors, belong to the group of
”passive components” for electronic equipment. Although in absolute ﬁgures the most com-
mon capacitors are integrated capacitors, e.g. in DRAMs or in ﬂash memory structures,
this article is concentrated on discrete components.
7.2 Capacitors
7.2.1 Theory of conventional construction
Figure 24
Model of a capacitor
A capacitor (historically known as a ”condenser”) is a device that stores energy in an electric
ﬁeld, by accumulating an internal imbalance of electric charge. It is made of two conductors
separated by a dielectric (insulator). Using the same analogy of water ﬂowing through a
pipe, a capacitor can be thought of as a tank, in which the charge can be thought of as a
volume of water in the tank. The tank can ”charge” and ”discharge” in the same manner as
a capacitor does to an electric charge. A mechanical analogy is that of a spring. The spring
holds a charge when it is pulled back.

Capacitors
When voltage exists one end of the capacitor is getting drained and the other end is getting
ﬁlled with charge.This is known as charging. Charging creates a charge imbalance between
the two plates and creates a reverse voltage that stops the capacitor from charging. As
a result, when capacitors are ﬁrst connected to voltage, charge ﬂows only to stop as the
capacitor becomes charged.
When a capacitor is charged, current stops ﬂowing and it
becomes an open circuit. It is as if the capacitor gained inﬁnite resistance.
You can also think of a capacitor as a ﬁctional battery in series with a ﬁctional resistance.
Starting the charging procedure with the capacitor completely discharged, the applied volt-
age is not counteracted by the ﬁctional battery, because the ﬁctional battery still has zero
voltage, and therefore the charging current is at its maximum. As the charging continues,
the voltage of the ﬁctional battery increases, and counteracts the applied voltage, so that
the charging current decreases as the ﬁctional battery’s voltage increases. Finally the ﬁc-
tional battery’s voltage equals the applied voltage, so that no current can ﬂow into, nor out
of, the capacitor.
Just as the capacitor charges it can be discharged. Think of the capacitor being a ﬁctional
battery that supplies at ﬁrst a maximum current to the ”load”, but as the discharging
continues the voltage of the ﬁctional battery keeps decreasing, and therefore the discharge
current also decreases. Finally the voltage of the ﬁctional battery is zero, and therefore the
discharge current also is then zero.
This is not the same as dielectric breakdown where the insulator between the capacitor
plates breaks down and discharges the capacitor.
That only happens at large voltages
and the capacitor is usually destroyed in the process. A spectacular example of dielectric
breakdown occurs when the two plates of the capacitor are brought into contact.
This
causes all the charge that has accumulated on both plates to be discharged at once. Such
a system is popular for powering tasers which need lots of energy in a very brief period of
time.

46

Capacitance
capacitors. In contrast to ceramic, ﬁlm and electrolytic capacitors, supercapacitors, also
known as electrical double-layer capacitors (EDLC) or ultracapacitors do not have a con-
ventional dielectric. The capacitance value of an electrochemical capacitor is determined
by two high-capacity storage principles. These principles are:
• electrostatic storage within Helmholtz double layers achieved on the phase interface be-
tween the surface of the electrodes and the electrolyte (double-layer capacitance) and
the
• electrochemical storage achieved by a faradaic electron charge-transfer by speciﬁcally
adsorpted ions with redox reactions (pseudocapacitance) . Unlike batteries, in the
faradaic redox reactions, the ions simply cling to the atomic structure of an electrode
without making or braking chemical bonds, and no or negligibly small chemical modiﬁ-
cations are involved in charge/discharge.
The ratio of the storage resulting from each principle can vary greatly, depending on elec-
trode design and electrolyte composition. Pseudocapacitance can increase the capacitance
value by as much as an order of magnitude over that of the double-layer by itself.2
7.3 Capacitance
The capacitance of a capacitor is a ratio of the amount of charge that will be present in the
capacitor when a given potential (voltage) exists between its leads. The unit of capacitance
is the farad4 which is equal to one coulomb per volt.
This is a very large capacitance
for most practical purposes; typical capacitors have values on the order of microfarads or
smaller.
C = Q
V
Where C is the capacitance in farads, V is the potential in volts, and Q is the charge
measured in coulombs. Solving this equation for the potential gives:
V = Q
C

Capacitors
When both plates are charged up to voltage V then there is no diﬀerence in voltage between
capacitor’s plates and electricity source therefore no current ﬂow in the circuit. This is
called Storing Charge

When the capacitor is connected to ground, current will ﬂow from capacitor to ground
until the voltage on capacitor’s plates are equal to zero.
Therefore, a Capacitor is a device that can Build up Charge , Store Charge and Release

7.6.1 Capacitors in Series
Capacitors in series are the same as increasing the distance between two capacitor plates.
As well, it should be noted that placing two 100 V capacitors in series results in the same
as having one capacitor with the total maximum voltage of 200 V. This, however, is not
recommended to be done in practice, especially with capacitors of diﬀerent values.
In
a capacitor network in series, all capacitors can have a diﬀerent voltage over them .

7.7 RC Circuit
7.7.1 Introduction
An RC circuit is short for ’Resistor-Capacitor’ circuit. A capacitor takes a ﬁnite amount
of time to discharge through a resistor, which varies with the values of the resistor and
capacitor. A capacitor acts interestingly in an electronic circuit, practically speaking as a
combination of a voltage source and a variable resistor.
7.7.2 Basics
Below is a simple RC Circuit:
50

RC Circuit
Figure 28
There is a capacitor in parallel with the resistor and current probe. The way the capacitor
functions is by acting as a very low resistance load when the circuit is initially turned on.
This is illustrated below:
51

Capacitors
Figure 29
Initially, the capacitor has a very low resistance, almost 0. Since electricity takes the path
of least resistance, almost all the electricity ﬂows through the capacitor, not the resistor,
as the resistor has considerably higher resistance.
52

RC Circuit
Figure 30
As a capacitor charges, its resistance increases as it gains more and more charge. As the
resistance of the capacitor climbs, electricity begins to ﬂow not only to the capacitor, but
through the resistor as well:
53

Capacitors
Figure 31
Once the capacitor’s voltage equals that of the battery, meaning it is fully charged, it will
not allow any current to pass through it. As a capacitor charges its resistance increases
and becomes eﬀectively inﬁnite (open connection) and all the electricity ﬂows through the
resistor.
54

RC Circuit
Figure 32
Once the voltage source is disconnected, however, the capacitor acts as a voltage source
itself:
55

Capacitors
Figure 33
As time goes on, the capacitor’s charge begins to drop, and so does its voltage. This means
less current ﬂowing through the resistor:
56

RC Circuit
Figure 34
Once the capacitor is fully discharged, you are back to square one:
If one were to do this with a light and a capacitor connected to a battery, what you would
see is the following:
1. Switch is closed. Light does not light up.
2. Light gradually becomes brighter and brighter...
3. Light is at full luminosity.
4. Switch is released. Light continues to shine.
5. Light begins to fade...
57

Capacitors
6. Light is oﬀ.
This is how a capacitor acts. However, what if you changed the values of R1? C1? The
voltage of the battery? We will examine the mathematical relationship between the resistor,
capacitor, and charging rate below.
7.7.3 Time Constant
In order to ﬁnd out how long it takes for a capacitor to fully charge or discharge, or how
long it takes for the capacitor to reach a certain voltage, you must know a few things.
First, you must know the starting and ﬁnishing voltages. Secondly, you must know the
time constant of the circuit you have. Time constant is denoted by the Greek letter ’tau’
or τ . The formula to calculate this time constant is:
τ = RC
Great, so what does this mean? The time constant is how long it takes for a capacitor to
charge to 63% of its full charge. This time, in seconds, is found by multiplying the resistance
in ohms and the capacitance in farads.
According to the formula above, there are two ways to lengthen the amount of time it takes
to discharge. One would be to increase the resistance, and the other would be to increase
the capacitance of the capacitor. This should make sense. It should be noted that the
formula compounds, such that in the second time constant, it charges another 63%, based
on the original 63%. This gives you about 86.5% charge in the second time constant. Below
is a table.
Time Constant
Charge
1
63%
2
87%
3
95%

For all practicality, by the 5th time constant it is considered that the capacitor is fully
charged or discharged.

function for voltage based on time
v(t) = 1

Where i (t ) is the current ﬂowing through the capacitor as a function of time.
This equation is often used in another form. By diﬀerentiating with respect to time:
i(t) = C dv(t)
dt
Substituting v/r for i(t) and integrating the above equation gives you an equation used to
describe the charging and discharging characteristics of RC circuits. A charging character-

voltage), similarly, a discharge curve starts at the theoretical 100% (maximum voltage) and
exponentially falls back to 0% (0 volts).
7.8 Capacitors - general remarks
7.8.1 Common capacitors and their names
Capacitors are divided into two mechanical groups: Fixed capacitors with ﬁxed capacitance
values and variable capacitors with variable (trimmer) or adjustable (tunable) capacitance
values.
The most important group is the ﬁxed capacitors. Many got their names from the dielectric.
For a systematic classiﬁcation these characteristics can’t be used, because one of the oldest,
the electrolytic capacitor, is named instead by its cathode construction. So the most-used
names are simply historical.
The most common kinds of capacitors are:
• Ceramic capacitors have a ceramic dialectric.
• Film and paper capacitors are named for their dielectrics.
• Aluminum, tantalum and niobium electrolytic capacitors are named after the
material used as the anode and the construction of the cathode
• Supercapacitor is the family name for:
• Double-layer capacitors were named for the physical phenomenon of the Helmholtz
double-layer
• Pseudocapacitors were named for their ability to store electric energy electro-
chemically with reversible faradaic charge-transfer
• Hybrid capacitors combine double-layer and pseudocapacitors to increase power den-
sity
• Seldom-used Silver mica, glass, silicon, air-gap and vacuum capacitors were
named for their dielectric.
Capacitors in each family have similar physical design features, but vary, for example, in
the form of the terminals.
59

Capacitors
Figure 35
Overview over the most commonly used ﬁxed capacitors in electronic
equipment
In addition to the above shown capacitor types, which derived their name from historical
development, there are many individual capacitors that have been named based on their
application. They include:
• Power capacitors, motor capacitors, DC-link capacitors, suppression capacitors, audio
crossover capacitors, lighting ballast capacitors, snubber capacitors, coupling, decoupling
or bypassing capacitors.
Often, more than one capacitor family is employed for these applications, e.g. interference
suppression can use ceramic capacitors or ﬁlm capacitors.
Specialized devices such as built-in capacitors with metal conductive areas in diﬀerent layers
of a multi-layer printed circuit board and kludges such as twisting together two pieces of
insulated wire also exist.

• Ceramics
• Plastic ﬁlms
• Oxide5 layer on metal (Aluminum6, Tantalum7, Niobium8)
• Natural materials like mica9, glass10, paper11, air12, vacuum13
All of them store their electrical charge statically within an electric ﬁeld14 between two

Beneath this conventional capacitors a family of electrochemical capacitors called Superca-
pacitor15s was developed. Supercapacitors don’t have a conventional dielectric. They store
their electrical charge statically in
• Helmholtz double-layers16 (Double-layer capacitors)
and additional electrochemical with faradaic charge transfer
• with a pseudocapacitance17 (Pseudocapacitors)
• or with both storage principles together (Hybrid capacitors).

The capacitor’s plate area can be adapted to the wanted capacitance value. The permittivity
and the dielectric thickness are the determining parameter for capacitors. Ease of processing
is also crucial. Thin, mechanically ﬂexible sheets can be wrapped or stacked easily, yielding
large designs with high capacitance values. Razor-thin metallized sintered ceramic layers
covered with metallized electrodes however, oﬀer the best conditions for the miniaturization
of circuits with SMD styles.
A short view to the ﬁgures in the table above gives the explanation for some simple facts:
• Supercapacitor45s have the highest capacitance density because of its special charge
storage principles
• Electrolytic capacitor46s have lesser capacitance density than supercapacitors but the
highest capacitance density of conventional capacitors because its thin dielectric.
• Ceramic capacitor47s class 2 have much higher capacitance values in a given case than
class 1 capacitors because of their much higher permittivity.
• Film capacitor48s with their diﬀerent plastic ﬁlm material do have a small spread in the
dimensions for a given capacitance/voltage value of a ﬁlm capacitor because the minimum
dielectric ﬁlm thickness diﬀers between the diﬀerent ﬁlm materials.

the ”CV product”, calculated by multiplying the capacitance (C) by the maximum voltage
rating (V), divided by the volume. From 1970 to 2005, volumetric eﬃciencies have improved
dramatically.

necessary to achieve the capacitor’s desired characteristics. The electrical behavior of the
ceramic material is divided into two stability classes:
• Class 154 ceramic capacitors with high stability and low losses compensating the inﬂuence
of temperature in resonant circuit application. Common EIA55/IEC56 code abbreviations
are C0G57/NP0, P2G/N150, R2G/N220, U2J/N750 etc.

• Class 258 ceramic capacitors with high volumetric eﬃciency59 for buﬀer, by-pass and
coupling applications Common EIA/IEC code abbreviations are: X7R/2XI, Z5U/E26,
Y5V/2F4, X7S/2C1, etc.
The great plasticity of ceramic raw material works well for many special applications and
enables an enormous diversity of styles, shapes and great dimensional spread of ceramic
capacitors. The smallest discrete capacitor, for instance, is a ”01005” chip capacitor with
the dimension of only 0.4 mm × 0.2 mm.
The construction of ceramic multilayer capacitors with mostly alternating layers results
in single capacitors connected in parallel.
This conﬁguration increases capacitance and
decreases all losses and parasitic inductance60s. Ceramic capacitors are well-suited for high
frequencies and high current pulse loads.
Because the thickness of the ceramic dielectric layer can be easily controlled and produced
by the desired application voltage, ceramic capacitors are available with rated voltages up
to the 30 kV range.
Some ceramic capacitors of special shapes and styles are used as capacitors for special
applications, including RFI/EMI suppression capacitors61 for connection to supply mains,
also known as safety capacitors,6263 X2Y® capacitors for bypassing and decoupling appli-
cations,64 feed-through capacitors for noise suppression by low-pass ﬁlters65 and ceramic
power capacitors66 for transmitters and HF applications.6768

7.9.2 Film capacitors
Main Page: Film capacitor
Figure 49
Three examples of diﬀerent ﬁlm capacitor conﬁgurations for increasing surge
current ratings
Film capacitor81s or plastic ﬁlm capacitors are non-polarized capacitors with an insulating
plastic ﬁlm as the dielectric. The dielectric ﬁlms are drawn to a thin layer, provided with
metallic electrodes and wound into a cylindrical winding. The electrodes of ﬁlm capacitors
may be metallized aluminum or zinc, applied on one or both sides of the plastic ﬁlm,
resulting in metallized ﬁlm capacitors or a separate metallic foil overlying the ﬁlm, called
ﬁlm/foil capacitors.
Metallized ﬁlm capacitors oﬀer self-healing properties.
Dielectric breakdowns or shorts
between the electrodes do not destroy the component. The metallized construction makes
it possible to produce wound capacitors with larger capacitance values (up to 100 µF and
larger) in smaller cases than within ﬁlm/foil construction.
Film/foil capacitors or metal foil capacitors use two plastic ﬁlms as the dielectric. Each ﬁlm
is covered with a thin metal foil, mostly aluminium, to form the electrodes. The advantage
81
http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Film%20capacitor
73

Capacitors
of this construction is the ease of connecting the metal foil electrodes, along with an excellent
current pulse strength.
A key advantage of every ﬁlm capacitor’s internal construction is direct contact to the
electrodes on both ends of the winding. This contact keeps all current paths very short.
The design behaves like a large number of individual capacitors connected in parallel, thus
reducing the internal ohm82ic losses (ESR83) and parasitic inductance (ESL). The inherent
geometry of ﬁlm capacitor structure results in low ohmic losses and a low parasitic induc-
tance, which makes them suitable for applications with high surge currents (snubber84s)
and for AC power applications, or for applications at higher frequencies.
The plastic ﬁlms used as the dielectric for ﬁlm capacitors are Polypropylene85 (PP),
Polyester86 (PET), Polyphenylene sulﬁde87 (PPS), Polyethylene naphthalate88 (PEN), and
Polytetraﬂuoroethylene89 or Teﬂon90 (PTFE). Polypropylene ﬁlm material with a market
share of something about 50% and Polyester ﬁlm with something about 40% are the most
used ﬁlm materials. The rest of something about 10% will be used by all other materials
including PPS and paper with roughly 3%, each.9192

Features/applications
Disadvantages
Metallized ﬁlm capacitors
PP, PET, PEN, PPS, (PTFE)
Metallized ﬁlm capacitors are signiﬁcantly smaller in size
than ﬁlm/foil versions and have self-healing properties.
Thin metallized electrodes limit the maximum current97
carrying capability respectively the maximum possible pulse
voltage.
Film/foil ﬁlm capacitors
PP, PET, PTFE
Film/foil ﬁlm capacitors have the highest surge
ratings/pulse voltage, respectively. Peak currents are higher
than for metallized types.
No self-healing properties: internal short may be disabling.
Larger dimensions than metallized alternative.
Polypropylene (PP) ﬁlm capacitors
Polypropylene98
(Treofan®)
Most popular ﬁlm capacitor dielectric. Predictable linear
and low capacitance change with operating temperature.
Suitable for applications in Class-1 frequency-determining
circuits and precision analog applications. Very narrow
capacitances. Extremely low dissipation factor. Low
moisture absorption, therefore suitable for ”naked” designs
with no coating. High insulation resistance. Usable in
high power applications such as snubber or IGBT. Used
also in AC99 power applications, such as in motors or
power factor correction100. Very low dielectric losses. High
frequency and high power applications such as induction
heating101. Widely used for safety/EMI suppression,
including connection to power supply mains.
Maximum operating temperature of 105 °C. Relatively
low permittivity of 2.2. PP ﬁlm capacitors tend to be
larger than other ﬁlm capacitors. More susceptible to
damage from transient over-voltages or voltage reversals
than oil-impregnated MKV-capacitors for pulsed power102
applications.

Smaller in size than functionally comparable polypropylene
ﬁlm capacitors. Low moisture absorption. Have almost
completely replaced metallized paper and polystyrene
ﬁlm for most DC applications. Mainly used for general
purpose applications or semi-critical circuits with operating
temperatures up to 125 °C. Operating voltages up to
60,000 V DC.
Usable at low (AC power) frequencies. Limited use in
power electronics due to higher losses with increasing
temperature and frequency.

(PEN) ﬁlm capacitors
Polyethylene naphthalate104 (Kaladex®)
Better stability at high temperatures than PET. More
suitable for high temperature applications and for SMD
packaging. Mainly used for non-critical ﬁltering, coupling
and decoupling, because temperature dependencies are not
signiﬁcant.
Lower relative permittivity and lower dielectric strength
imply larger dimensions for a given capacitance and rated
voltage than PET.
Polyphenylene Sulﬁde (PPS)
ﬁlm capacitors
Polyphenylene (Torelina®)
Small temperature dependence over the entire temperature
range and a narrow frequency dependence in a wide
frequency range. Dissipation factor is quite small and stable.
Operating emperatures up to 270 °C. Suitable for SMD.
Tolerate increased reﬂow soldering temperatures for lead-
free soldering mandated by the RoHS 2002/95/European
Union directive105
Above 100 °C, the dissipation factor increases, increasing
component temperature, but can operate without
degradation. Cost is usually higher than PP.

A related type is the power ﬁlm capacitor113. The materials and construction techniques
used for large power ﬁlm capacitors mostly are similar to those of ordinary ﬁlm capacitors.
However, capacitors with high to very high power ratings for applications in power systems
and electrical installations are often classiﬁed separately, for historical reasons. The stan-
dardization of ordinary ﬁlm capacitors is oriented on electrical and mechanical parameters.
The standardization of power capacitors by contrast emphasizes the safety of personnel and
equipment, as given by the local regulating authority.
As modern electronic equipment gained the capacity to handle power levels that were pre-
viously the exclusive domain of ”electrical power” components, the distinction between the
113

Capacitors
”electronic” and ”electrical” power ratings blurred. Historically, the boundary between these
two families was approximately at a reactive power of 200 volt-amps.
Film power capacitors mostly use polypropylene ﬁlm as the dielectric.
Other types in-
clude metallized paper capacitors (MP capacitors) and mixed dielectric ﬁlm capacitors with
polypropylene dielectrics. MP capacitors serve for cost applications and as ﬁeld-free carrier
electrodes (soggy foil capacitors) for high AC or high current pulse loads. Windings can be
ﬁlled with an insulating oil or with epoxy resin114 to reduce air bubbles, thereby preventing
short circuits.
They ﬁnd use as converters to change voltage, current or frequency, to store or deliver
abruptly electric energy or to improve the power factor. The rated voltage range of these
capacitors is from approximately120 V AC (capacitive lighting ballasts) to 100 kV.115

7.9.4 Electrolytic capacitors
Main Page: Electrolytic capacitor124
Electrolytic capacitor125s have a metallic anode covered with an oxidized layer used as dielec-
tric. The second electrode is a non-solid (wet) or solid electrolyte. Electrolytic capacitors
are polarized. Three families are available, categorized according to their dielectric.
• Aluminum electrolytic capacitors with aluminum oxide126 as dielectric
• Tantalum electrolytic capacitors with tantalum pentoxide127 as dielectric
• Niobium electrolytic capacitors with niobium pentoxide128 as dielectric.
The anode is highly roughened to increase the surface area. This and the relatively high
permittivity of the oxide layer gives these capacitors very high capacitance per unit volume
compared with ﬁlm- or ceramic capacitors.
The permittivity of tantalum pentoxide is approximately three times higher than aluminium
dioxide, producing signiﬁcantly smaller components. However, permittivity determines only
the dimensions. Electrical parameters, especially conductivity129, are established by the
electrolyte’s material and composition. Three general types of electrolytes are used:
• non solid (wet, liquid)—conductivity approximately 10 mS/cm and are the lowest cost
• solid manganese oxide—conductivity approximately 100 mS/cm oﬀer high quality and
stability

Capacitors
The large capacitance per unit volume of electrolytic capacitors make them valuable in
relatively high-current and low-frequency electrical circuits139, e.g. in power supply140 ﬁl-
ters for decoupling unwanted AC components from DC power connections or as coupling
capacitors in audio ampliﬁers, for passing or bypassing low-frequency signals and storing
large amounts of energy. The relatively high capacitance value of an electrolytic capaci-
tor combined with the very low ESR of the polymer electrolyte of polymer capacitor141s,
especially in SMD styles, makes them a competitor to MLC chip capacitors in personal
computer power supplies.
Bipolar electrolytics (also called Non-Polarized capacitors) contain two anodized aluminium
foils, behaving like two capacitors connected in series opposition.
Electolytic capacitors for special applications include motor start capacitors,142 ﬂashlight
capacitors143 and audio frequency capacitors.144

Su-
percapacitor, sometimes called ultracapacitor is a generic term for electric double-layer
capacitor156s (EDLC), pseudocapacitor157s and hybrid capacitors. They don’t have a con-
ventional solid dielectric158. The capacitance value of an electrochemical capacitor is deter-
mined by two storage principles, both of which contribute to the total capacitance of the
capacitor:159160161

Capacitor - types and styles
• Double-layer capacitance162 – Storage is achieved by separation of charge in a
Helmholtz163 double layer164 at the interface165 between the surface of a conductor and
an electrolytic solution. The distance of separation of charge in a double-layer is on the
order of a few Angstrom166s (0.3–0.8 nm167). This storage is electrostatic168 in origin.169
• Pseudocapacitance171 – Storage is achieved by redox reactions172, electrosorbtion or in-
tercalation173 on the surface of the electrode or by speciﬁcally adsorpted ion174s that
results in a reversible faradaic175 charge-transfer176. The pseudocapacitance is faradaic
in origin.177
The ratio of the storage resulting from each principle can vary greatly, depending on elec-
trode design and electrolyte composition. Pseudocapacitance can increase the capacitance
value by as much as an order of magnitude over that of the double-layer by itself.179
Supercapacitors are divided into three families, based on the design of the electrodes:
• Double-layer capacitors – with carbon180 electrodes or derivates with much higher
static double-layer capacitance than the faradaic pseudocapacitance
• Pseudocapacitors – with electrodes out of metal oxides or conducting polymers with a
high amount of faradaic pseudocapacitance
• Hybrid capacitors – capacitors with special and asymmetric electrodes that exhibit
both signiﬁcant double-layer capacitance and pseudocapacitance, such as lithium-ion ca-
pacitor181s
Supercapacitors bridge the gap between conventional capacitors and rechargeable batter-
ies182. They have the highest available capacitance values per unit volume and the greatest
energy density183 of all capacitors. They support up to 12,000 Farad184s/1.2 Volt,185 with

Capacitors
capacitance values up to 10,000 times that of electrolytic capacitor186s.187 While existing
supercapacitors have energy densities that are approximately 10% of a conventional battery,
their power density188 is generally 10 to 100 times greater. Power density is deﬁned as the
product of energy density, multiplied by the speed at which the energy is delivered to the
load189. The greater power density results in much shorter charge/discharge cycles than
a battery is capable, and a greater tolerance for numerous charge/discharge cycles. This
makes them well-suited for parallel connection with batteries, and may improve battery
performance in terms of power density.
Within electrochemical capacitors, the electrolyte is the conductive connection between the
two electrodes, distinguishing them from electrolytic capacitors, in which the electrolyte
only forms the cathode, the second electrode.
Supercapacitors are polarized and must operate with correct polarity. Polarity is controlled
by design with asymmetric electrodes, or, for symmetric electrodes, by a potential applied
during the manufacturing process.
Supercapacitors support a broad spectrum of applications for power and energy require-
ments, including:
• Low supply current during longer times for memory backup in (SRAM190s) in electronic
equipment
• Power electronics that require very short, high current, as in the KERS191system in
Formula 1192 cars
• Recovery of braking energy for vehicles such as buses and trains
Supercapacitors are rarely interchangeable, especially those with higher energy densities.
IEC standard 62391-1 Fixed electric double layer capacitors for use in electronic equipment
identiﬁes four application classes:
• Class 1, Memory backup, discharge current in mA = 1 • C (F)
• Class 2, Energy storage, discharge current in mA = 0.4 • C (F) • V (V)
• Class 3, Power, discharge current in mA = 4 • C (F) • V (V)
• Class 4, Instantaneous power, discharge current in mA = 40 • C (F) • V (V)
Exceptional for electronic components like capacitors are the manifold diﬀerent trade or
series names used for supercapacitors like: APowerCap, BestCap, BoostCap, CAP-XX, DL-
CAP, EneCapTen, EVerCAP, DynaCap, Faradcap, GreenCap, Goldcap, HY-CAP, Kapton
capacitor, Super capacitor, SuperCap, PAS Capacitor, PowerStor, PseudoCap, Ultracapac-
itor making it diﬃcult for users to classify these capacitors.

7.9.6 Miscellaneous capacitors
Beneath the above described capacitors covering more or less nearly the total market of
discrete capacitors some new developments or very special capacitor types as well as older
types can be found in electronics.
Integrated capacitors
• Integrated capacitors—in integrated circuits196, nano-scale capacitors can be formed by
appropriate patterns of metallization on an isolating substrate. They may be packaged in
multiple capacitor arrays with no other semiconductive parts as discrete components.197
• Glass capacitors—First Leyden jar198 capacitor was made of glass, as of 2012 glass capac-
itors were in use as SMD version for applications requiring ultra-reliable and ultra-stable
service.
Power capacitors
• Vacuum capacitor199s—used in high power RF200 transmitters
• SF6201 gas ﬁlled capacitors—used as capacitance standard in measuring bridge circuits
Special capacitors
• Printed circuit board202s—metal conductive areas in diﬀerent layers of a multi-layer
printed circuit board can act as a highly stable capacitor. It is common industry practice
to ﬁll unused areas of one PCB layer with the ground conductor and another layer with
the power conductor, forming a large distributed capacitor between the layers.
• Wire—2 pieces of insulated wire twisted together. Capacitance alues usually range from
3 pF to 15 pF. Used in homemade VHF203 circuits for oscillation feedback.
Obsolete capacitors
• Mica capacitor204s—the ﬁrst capacitors with stable frequency behavior and low losses,
used for military radio applications during World War II205
• Air206-gap capacitors—used by the ﬁrst spark-gap transmitter207s

7.9.7 Variable capacitors
Variable capacitors may have their capacitance changed by mechanical motion. Generally
two versions of variable capacitors has to be to distinguished
• Tuning capacitor – variable capacitor for intentionally and repeatedly tuning an oscillator
circuit in a radio or another tuned circuit
• Trimmer capacitor – small variable capacitor usually for one-time oscillator circuit inter-
nal adjustment
Variable capacitors include capacitors that use a mechanical construction to change the
distance between the plates, or the amount of plate surface area which overlaps.
They
mostly use air as dielectric medium.
Semiconductive variable capacitance diodes217 are not capacitors in the sense of passive
components but can change their capacitance as a function of the applied reverse bias
voltage and are used like a variable capacitor. They have replaced much of the tuning and
trimmer capacitors.

7.9.8 Market
Discrete capacitors today are industrial products produced in very large quantities for use
in electronic and in electrical equipment.
Globally, the market for ﬁxed capacitors was

This market is dominated by ceramic capacitors with estimate of approximately one trillion
(1 × 1012) items per year.220

7.10 Capacitor - Electrical characteristics
7.10.1 Series-equivalent circuit
Figure 77
Series-equivalent circuit model of a capacitor
Discrete capacitors deviate from the ideal capacitor. An ideal capacitor only stores and re-
leases electrical energy, with no dissipation. Capacitor components have losses and parasitic
inductive parts. These imperfections in material and construction can have positive impli-
cations such as linear frequency and temperature behavior in class 1 ceramic capacitors.
Conversely, negative implications include the non-linear, voltage-dependent capacitance in
class 2 ceramic capacitors or the insuﬃcient dielectric insulation of capacitors leading to
leakage currents.
All properties can be deﬁned and speciﬁed by a series equivalent circuit composed out
of an idealized capacitance and additional electrical components which model all losses
and inductive parameters of a capacitor.
In this series-equivalent circuit the electrical
characteristics are deﬁned by:
• C , the capacitance of the capacitor
• R insul, the insulation resistance229 of the dielectric, not to be confused with the insulation
of the housing
• R leak, the resistance representing the leakage current230 of the capacitor
• R ESR, the equivalent series resistance231 which summarizes all ohmic losses of the capac-
itor, usually abbreviated as ”ESR”
• L ESL, the equivalent series inductance232 which is the eﬀective self-inductance of the
capacitor, usually abbreviated as ”ESL”.

Capacitor - Electrical characteristics
Using a series equivalent circuit instead of a parallel equivalent circuit is speciﬁed by
IEC233/EN 60384-1.
7.10.2 Standard values and tolerances
The ”rated capacitance” CR or ”nominal capacitance” CN is the value for which the capacitor
has been designed. Actual capacitance depends on the measured frequency and ambient
temperature. Standard measuring conditions are a low-voltage AC measuring method at a
temperature of 20 °C with frequencies of
• 100 kHz, 1 MHz (preferred) or 10 MHz for non-electrolytic capacitors with CR ≤1 nF:
• 1 kHz or 10 kHz for non-electrolytic capacitors with 1 nF < CR ≤10 μF
• 100/120 Hz for electrolytic capacitors
• 50/60 Hz or 100/120 Hz for non-electrolytic capacitors with CR > 10 μF
For supercapacitors a voltage drop method is applied for measuring the capacitance value.
.
Capacitors are available in geometrically increasing preferred values234 (E series235 stan-
dards) speciﬁed in IEC/EN 60063. According to the number of values per decade, these
were called the E3, E6, E12, E24 etc. series. The range of units used to specify capacitor
values has expanded to include everything from pico- (pF), nano- (nF) and microfarad (µF)
to farad (F). Millifarad and kilofarad are uncommon.
The percentage of allowed deviation from the rated value is called tolerance236. The actual
capacitance value should be within its tolerance limits, or it is out of speciﬁcation. IEC/EN
60062 speciﬁes a letter code for each tolerance.

Electrolytic capacitors, which are often used for ﬁltering237 and bypassing238 capacitors

Capacitance typically varies with temperature. The diﬀerent dielectrics express great dif-
ferences in temperature sensitivity. The temperature coeﬃcient is expressed in parts per
million239 (ppm) per degree Celsius for class 1 ceramic capacitors or in % over the total
temperature range for all others.

Capacitor - Electrical characteristics
7.10.4 Frequency dependence
Most discrete capacitor types have more or less capacitance changes with increasing fre-
quencies. The dielectric strength of class 2 ceramic and plastic ﬁlm diminishes with rising
frequency.
Therefore their capacitance value decreases with increasing frequency.
This
phenomenon for ceramic class 2 and plastic ﬁlm dielectrics is related to dielectric relax-
ation247 in which the time constant of the electrical dipoles is the reason for the frequency
dependence of permittivity248. The graphs below show typical frequency behavior of the
capacitance for ceramic and ﬁlm capacitors.

For electrolytic capacitors with non-solid electrolyte, mechanical motion of the ion249s oc-
curs. Their movability is limited so that at higher frequencies not all areas of the roughened
anode structure are covered with charge-carrying ions. As higher the anode structure is
roughned as more the capacitance value decreases with increasing frequency. Low voltage

types with highly-roughened anodes display capacitance at 100 kHz approximately 10 to
20% of the value measured at 100 Hz.
7.10.5 Voltage dependence
Capacitance may also change with applied voltage. This eﬀect is more prevalent in class 2
ceramic capacitors. The permittivity of ferroelectric class 2 material depends on the applied
voltage. Higher applied voltage lowers permittivity. The change of capacitance can drop
to 80% of the value measured with the standardized measuring voltage of 0.5 or 1.0 V.
This behavior is a small source of non-linearity in low-distortion ﬁlters and other analog
applications. In audio applications this can be the reason for harmonic distortion250.
Film capacitors and electrolytic capacitors have no signiﬁcant voltage dependence.

7.10.6 Rated and category voltage
Figure 82
Relation between rated and category temperature range and applied voltage
The voltage at which the dielectric becomes conductive is called the breakdown voltage, and
is given by the product of the dielectric strength and the separation between the electrodes.
The dielectric strength depends on temperature, frequency, shape of the electrodes, etc.
Because a breakdown in a capacitor normally is a short circuit and destroys the component,
the operating voltage is lower than the breakdown voltage. The operating voltage is speciﬁed
such that the voltage may be applied continuously throughout the life of the capacitor.
In IEC/EN 60384-1 the allowed operating voltage is called ”rated voltage” or ”nominal
voltage”. The rated voltage (UR) is the maximum DC voltage or peak pulse voltage that
may be applied continuously at any temperature within the rated temperature range.
The voltage proof of nearly all capacitors decreases with increasing temperature. For some
applications it is important to use a higher temperature range. Lowering the voltage applied
at a higher temperature maintains safety margins. For some capacitor types therefore the
IEC standard specify a second ”temperature derated voltage” for a higher temperature
range, the ”category voltage”. The category voltage (UC) is the maximum DC voltage or

peak pulse voltage that may be applied continuously to a capacitor at any temperature
within the category temperature range.
The relation between both voltages and temperatures is given in the picture right.

In general, a capacitor is seen as a storage component for electric energy.
But this is
only one capacitor function. A capacitor can also act as an AC251 resistor252. In many
cases the capacitor is used as a decoupling capacitor253 to ﬁlter or bypass undesired biased

Capacitor - Electrical characteristics
AC frequencies to the ground. Other applications use capacitors for capacitive coupling254
of AC signals; the dielectric is used only for blocking DC. For such applications the AC
resistance255 is as important as the capacitance value.
The frequency dependent AC resistance is called impedance256 Z and is the complex257 ratio
of the voltage to the current in an AC circuit. Impedance extends the concept of resistance
to AC circuits and possesses both magnitude and phase258 at a particular frequency. This
is unlike resistance, which has only magnitude.
Z = |Z|ejθ
The magnitude |Z| represents the ratio of the voltage diﬀerence amplitude to the current
amplitude, j is the imaginary unit259, while the argument θ gives the phase diﬀerence between
voltage and current.
In capacitor data sheets, only the impedance magnitude |Z| is speciﬁed, and simply written
as ”Z” so that the formula for the impedance can be written in Cartesian form260
Z = R+jX
where the real part261 of impedance is the resistance R (for capacitors ESR) and the imagi-
nary part262 is the reactance263 X.
As shown in a capacitor’s series-equivalent circuit, the real component includes an ideal
capacitor C, an inductance L(ESL) and a resistor R(ESR). The total reactance at the
angular frequency ω therefore is given by the geometric (complex) addition of a capacitive
reactance (Capacitance264) XC = −1
ωC and an inductive reactance (Inductance265): XL =
ωLESL.
To calculate the impedance Z the resistance has to be added geometrically and then Z is
given by
Z =
√
ESR2 +(XC +(−XL))2. The impedance is a measure of the capacitor’s ability to
pass alternating currents. In this sense the impedance can be used like Ohms law
Z = ˆu
ˆı = Ueﬀ
Ieﬀ.
to calculate either the peak or the eﬀective value of the current or the voltage.

Capacitors
In the special case of resonance266, in which the both reactive resistances
XC = −1
ωC and XL = ωLESL
have the same value (XC = XL), then the impedance will only be determined by ESR.
Figure 84
Typical impedance curves for diﬀerent capacitance values over frequency
showing the typical form with a decreasing impedance values below resonance and
increasing values above resonance. As higher the capacitance as lower the resonance.
The impedance speciﬁed in the datasheets often show typical curves for the diﬀerent capac-
itance values. With increasing frequency as the impedance decreases down to a minimum.
The lower the impedance, the more easily alternating currents can be passed through the
capacitor. At the apex267, the point of resonance, where XC has the same value than XL, the
capacitor has the lowest impedance value. Here only the ESR determines the impedance.
With frequencies above the resonance the impedance increases again due to the ESL of the
capacitor. The capacitor becomes to an inductance.
As shown in the graph, the higher capacitance values can ﬁt the lower frequencies better
while the lower capacitance values can ﬁt better the higher frequencies.
Aluminum electrolytic capacitors have relatively good decoupling properties in the lower
frequency range up to about 1 MHz due to their large capacitance values. This is the reason

Capacitor - Electrical characteristics
for using electrolytic capacitors in standard or switched-mode power supplies268 behind the
rectiﬁer269 for smoothing application.
Ceramic and ﬁlm capacitors are already out of their smaller capacitance values suitable for
higher frequencies up to several 100 MHz. They also have signiﬁcantly lower parasitic in-
ductance, making them suitable for higher frequency applications, due to their construction
with end-surface contacting of the electrodes. To increase the range of frequencies, often
an electrolytic capacitor is connected in parallel with a ceramic or ﬁlm capacitor.270
Many new developments are targeted at reducing parasitic inductance (ESL). This increases
the resonance frequency of the capacitor and, for example, can follow the constantly increas-
ing switching speed of digital circuits. Miniaturization, especially in the SMD multilayer
ceramic chip capacitors (MLCC271), increases the resonance frequency. Parasitic inductance
is further lowered by placing the electrodes on the longitudinal side of the chip instead of
the lateral side. The ”face-down” construction associated with multi-anode technology in
tantalum electrolytic capacitors further reduced ESL. Capacitor families such as the so-
called MOS capacitor or silicon capacitors oﬀer solutions when capacitors at frequencies up
to the GHz range are needed.
7.10.8 Inductance (ESL) and self-resonant frequency
ESL in industrial capacitors is mainly caused by the leads and internal connections used
to connect the capacitor plates to the outside world. Large capacitors tend to have higher
ESL than small ones because the distances to the plate are longer and every mm counts as
an inductance.
For any discrete capacitor, there is a frequency above DC at which it ceases to behave as
a pure capacitor. This frequency, where XC is as high as XL, is called the self-resonant
frequency.
The self-resonant frequency is the lowest frequency at which the impedance
passes through a minimum.
For any AC application the self-resonant frequency is the
highest frequency at which capacitors can be used as a capacitive component.
This is critically important for decoupling272 high-speed logic circuits from the power supply.
The decoupling capacitor supplies transient273 current to the chip. Without decouplers, the
IC demands current faster than the connection to the power supply can supply it, as parts of
the circuit rapidly switch on and oﬀ. To counter this potential problem, circuits frequently
use multiple bypass capacitors—small (100 nF or less) capacitors rated for high frequencies,
a large electrolytic capacitor rated for lower frequencies and occasionally, an intermediate
value capacitor.

7.10.9 Ohmic losses, ESR, dissipation factor, and quality factor
The summarized losses in discrete capacitors are ohmic AC274 losses.
DC275 losses are
speciﬁed as ”leakage current276” or ”insulating resistance” and are negligible for an AC spec-
iﬁcation. AC losses are non-linear, possibly depending on frequency, temperature, age or
humidity. The losses result from two physical conditions:
• line losses including internal supply line resistances, the contact resistance of the electrode
contact, line resistance of the electrodes, and in ”wet” aluminum electrolytic capacitors
and especially supercapacitors, the limited conductivity of liquid electrolytes and
• dielectric losses277 from dielectric polarization278.
The largest share of these losses in larger capacitors is usually the frequency dependent
ohmic dielectric losses. For smaller components, especially for wet electrolytic capacitors,
conductivity of liquid electrolytes may exceed dielectric losses. To measure these losses,
the measurement frequency must be set. Since commercially available components oﬀer
capacitance values cover 15 orders of magnitude, ranging from pF (10−12 F) to some 1000 F
in supercapacitors, it is not possible to capture the entire range with only one frequency.
IEC 60384-1 states that ohmic losses should be measured at the same frequency used to
measure capacitance. These are:
• 100 kHz, 1 MHz (preferred) or 10 MHz for non-electrolytic capacitors with CR ≤1 nF:
• 1 kHz or 10 kHz for non-electrolytic capacitors with 1 nF < CR ≤10 μF
• 100/120 Hz for electrolytic capacitors
• 50/60 Hz or 100/120 Hz for non-electrolytic capacitors with CR > 10 μF
A capacitor’s summarized resistive losses may be speciﬁed either as ESR, as a dissipation
factor279(DF, tan δ), or as quality factor280 (Q), depending on application requirements.
Capacitors with higher ripple current IR loads, such as electrolytic capacitors, are speciﬁed
with equivalent series resistance281 ESR. ESR can be shown as an ohmic part in the above
vector diagram. ESR values are speciﬁed in datasheets per individual type.
The losses of ﬁlm capacitors and some class 2 ceramic capacitors are mostly speciﬁed with
the dissipation factor tan δ. These capacitors have smaller losses than electrolytic capacitors
and mostly are used at higher frequencies up to some hundred MHz. However the numeric
value of the dissipation factor, measured at the same frequency, is independent on the
capacitance value and can be speciﬁed for a capacitor series with a range of capacitance.
The dissipation factor is determined as the tangent of the reactance (XC −XL) and the
ESR, and can be shown as the angle δ between imaginary and the impedance axis.
If the inductance ESL is small, the dissipation factor can be approximated as:

tanδ = ESR·ωC
Capacitors with very low losses, such as ceramic Class 1 and Class 2 capacitors, specify
resistive losses with a quality factor282 (Q). Ceramic Class 1 capacitors are especially suitable
for LC resonant circuits with frequencies up to the GHz range, and precise high and low pass
ﬁlters. For an electrically resonant system, Q represents the eﬀect of electrical resistance283
and characterizes a resonator’s bandwidth284 B relative to its center or resonant frequency
f0. Q is deﬁned as the reciprocal value of the dissipation factor.

Capacitor - Electrical characteristics
7.10.10 Limiting current loads
A capacitor can act as an AC resistor, coupling AC voltage and AC current between two
points. Every AC current ﬂow through a capacitor generates heat inside the capacitor body.
These dissipation power loss P is caused by ESR and is the squared value of the eﬀective
(RMS) current I
P = I2 ·ESR
The same power loss can be written with the dissipation factor tanδ as
P = U2 ·tanδ
2πf ·C
The internal generated heat has to be distributed to the ambient. The temperature of the
capacitor, which is established on the balance between heat produced and distributed, shall
not exceed the capacitors maximum speciﬁed temperature. Hence, the ESR or dissipation
factor is a mark for the maximum power (AC load, ripple current, pulse load, etc.)
a
capacitor is speciﬁed for.
AC currents may be a:
• ripple current—an eﬀective (RMS) AC current, coming from an AC voltage superimposed
of an DC bias, a
• pulse current—an AC peak current, coming from an voltage peak, or an
• AC current—an eﬀective (RMS) sinusoidal current
Ripple and AC currents mainly warms the capacitor body. By this currents internal gen-
erated temperature inﬂuences the breakdown voltage of the dielectric. Higher temperature
lower the voltage proof of all capacitors. In wet electrolytic capacitors higher tempera-
tures force the evaporation of electrolytes, shortening the life time of the capacitors. In
ﬁlm capacitors higher temperatures may shrink the plastic ﬁlm changing the capacitor’s
properties.
Pulse currents, especially in metallized ﬁlm capacitors, heat the contact areas between end
spray (schoopage) and metallized electrodes. This may reduce the contact to the electrodes,
heightening the dissipation factor.
For safe operation, the maximal temperature generated by any AC current ﬂow through
the capacitor is a limiting factor, which in turn limits AC load, ripple current, pulse load,
etc.
Ripple current
A ”ripple current” is the RMS288 value of a superimposed AC current of any frequency and
any waveform of the current curve for continuous operation at a speciﬁed temperature. It
288
http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Root%20mean%20square
117

Capacitors
arises mainly in power supplies (including switched-mode power supplies289) after rectify-
ing an AC voltage and ﬂows as charge and discharge current through the decoupling or
smoothing capacitor. The ”rated ripple current” shall not exceed a temperature rise of 3, 5
or 10 °C, depending on the capacitor type, at the speciﬁed maximum ambient temperature.
Ripple current generates heat within the capacitor body due to the ESR of the capacitor.
The ESR, composed out of the dielectric losses caused by the changing ﬁeld strength in the
dielectric and the losses resulting out of the slightly resistive supply lines or the electrolyte
depends on frequency and temperature. Higher frequencies heighten the ESR and higher
temperatures lower the ESR slightly.
The types of capacitors used for power applications have a speciﬁed rated value for maximum
ripple current. These are primarily aluminum electrolytic capacitors, and tantalum as well
as some ﬁlm capacitors and Class 2 ceramic capacitors.
Aluminium electrolytic capacitors, the most common type for power supplies, experience
shorter life expectancy at higher ripple currents. Exceeding the limit tends to result in
explosive failure.
Tantalum electrolytic capacitors with solid manganese dioxide electrolyte are also limited
by ripple current. Exceeding their ripple limits tends to shorts and burning components.
For ﬁlm and ceramic capacitors, normally speciﬁed with a loss factor tan δ, the ripple current
limit is determined by temperature rise in the body of approximately 10 °C. Exceeding this
limit may destroy the internal structure and cause shorts.
Pulse current
The rated pulse load for a certain capacitor is limited by the rated voltage, the pulse
repetition frequency, temperature range and pulse rise time. The ”pulse rise time” dv/dt,
represents the steepest voltage gradient of the pulse (rise or fall time) and is expressed in
volts per μs (V/μs).
The rated pulse rise time is also indirectly the maximum capacity of an applicable peak
current Ip. The peak current is deﬁned as:
Ip = C ·dv/dt
where: Ip is in A; C in µF; dv/dt in V/µs
The permissible pulse current capacity of a metallized ﬁlm capacitor generally allows an
internal temperature rise of 8 to 10 °K.
In the case of metallized ﬁlm capacitors, pulse load depends on the properties of the dielectric
material, the thickness of the metallization and the capacitor’s construction, especially the
construction of the contact areas between the end spray and metallized electrodes. High
peak currents may lead to selective overheating of local contacts between end spray and
metallized electrodes which may destroy some of the contacts, leading to increasing ESR.

Capacitor - Electrical characteristics
For metallized ﬁlm capacitors, so-called pulse tests simulate the pulse load that might occur
during an application, according to a standard speciﬁcation. IEC 60384 part 1, speciﬁes
that the test circuit is charged and discharged intermittently. The test voltage corresponds
to the rated DC voltage and the test comprises 10000 pulses with a repetition frequency of
1 Hz. The pulse stress capacity is the pulse rise time. The rated pulse rise time is speciﬁed
as 1/10 of the test pulse rise time.
The pulse load must be calculated for each application.
A general rule for calculating
the power handling of ﬁlm capacitors is not available because of vendor-related internal
construction details. To prevent the capacitor from overheating the following operating
parameters have to be considered:
• peak current per µF
• Pulse rise or fall time dv/dt in V/µs
• relative duration of charge and discharge periods (pulse shape)
• maximum pulse voltage (peak voltage)
• peak reverse voltage;
• Repetition frequency of the pulse
• Ambient temperature
• Heat dissipation (cooling)
Higher pulse rise times are permitted for pulse voltage lower than the rated voltage.
Examples for calculations of individual pulse loads are given by many manufactures, e.g.

AC current
Figure 85
Limiting conditions for capacitors operating with AC loads
An AC load only can be applied to a non-polarized capacitor. Capacitors for AC applications
are primarily ﬁlm capacitors, metallized paper capacitors, ceramic capacitors and bipolar
electrolytic capacitors.
The rated AC load for an AC capacitor is the maximum sinusoidal eﬀective AC current
(rms) which may be applied continuously to a capacitor within the speciﬁed temperature
range. In the datasheets the AC load may be expressed as
• rated AC voltage at low frequencies,
• rated reactive power at intermediate frequencies,
• reduced AC voltage or rated AC current at high frequencies.

Capacitor - Electrical characteristics
Figure 86
Typical rms AC voltage curves as a function of frequency, for 4 diﬀerent
capacitance values of a 63 V DC ﬁlm capacitor series
The rated AC voltage for ﬁlm capacitors is generally calculated so that an internal tem-
perature rise of 8 to 10 °K is the allowed limit for safe operation. Because dielectric losses
increase with increasing frequency, the speciﬁed AC voltage has to be derated at higher
frequencies. Datasheets for ﬁlm capacitors specify special curves for derating AC voltages
at higher frequencies.
If ﬁlm capacitors or ceramic capacitors only have a DC speciﬁcation, the peak value of the
AC voltage applied has to be lower than the speciﬁed DC voltage.
AC loads can occur in AC Motor run capacitors, for voltage doubling, in snubber292s, light-
ing ballast and for power factor correction293 PFC for phase shifting to improve transmission
network stability and eﬃciency, which is one of the most important applications for large
power capacitors. These mostly large PP ﬁlm or metallized paper capacitors are limited by
the rated reactive power VAr.
Bipolar electrolytic capacitors, to which an AC voltage may be applicable, are speciﬁed
with a rated ripple current.

7.10.11 Insulation resistance and self-discharge constant
The resistance of the dielectric is ﬁnite, leading to some level of DC ”leakage current”294 that
causes a charged capacitor to lose charge over time. For ceramic and ﬁlm capacitors, this
resistance is called ”insulation resistance Rins”. This resistance is represented by the resistor
Rins in parallel with the capacitor in the series-equivalent circuit of capacitors. Insulation
resistance must not be confused with the outer isolation of the component with respect to
the environment.
The time curve of self-discharge over insulation resistance with decreasing capacitor voltage
follows the formula
u(t) = U0 ·e−t/τs,
With stored DC voltage U0 and self-discharge constant
τs = Rins ·C
Thus, after τs voltage U0 drops to 37% of the initial value.
The self-discharge constant is an important parameter for the insulation of the dielectric
between the electrodes of ceramic and ﬁlm capacitors. For example, a capacitor can be
used as the time-determining component for time relays or for storing a voltage value as in
a sample and hold295 circuits or operational ampliﬁer296s.
Class 1 ceramic capacitors have an insulation resistance of at least 10 GΩ, while class 2
capacitors have at least 4 GΩ or a self-discharge constant of at least 100 s. Plastic ﬁlm ca-
pacitors typically have an insulation resistance of 6 to 12 GΩ. This corresponds to capacitors
in the uF range of a self-discarge constant of about 2000–4000 s.297
Insulation resistance respectively the self-discharge constant can be reduced if humidity
penetrates into the winding. It is partially strongly temperature dependent and decreases
with increasing temperature. Both decrease with increasing temperature.
In electrolytic capacitors, the insulation resistance is deﬁned as leakage current.

7.10.12 Leakage current
Figure 87
The general leakage current behavior of electrolytic capacitors depend on the
kind of electrolyte
For electrolytic capacitors the insulation resistance of the dielectric is termed ”leakage cur-
rent”. This DC current298 is represented by the resistor Rleak in parallel with the capacitor
in the series-equivalent circuit of electrolytic capacitors. This resistance between the ter-
minals of a capacitor is also ﬁnite. Rleak is lower for electrolytics than for ceramic or ﬁlm
capacitors.
The leakage current includes all weak imperfections of the dielectric caused by unwanted
chemical processes and mechanical damage. It is also the DC current that can pass through
the dielectric after applying a voltage. It depends on the interval without voltage applied
(storage time), the thermic stress from soldering, on voltage applied, on temperature of the
capacitor, and on measuring time.
The leakage current drops in the ﬁrst minutes after applying DC voltage. In this period
the dielectric oxide layer can self-repair weaknesses by building up new layers. The time
required depends generally on the electrolyte. Solid electrolytes drop faster than non-solid
electrolytes but remain at a slightly higher level.
298
http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Direct%20current
123

Capacitors
The leakage current in non-solid electrolytic capacitors as well as in manganese oxide solid
tantalum capacitors decreases with voltage-connected time due to self-healing eﬀects. Al-
though electrolytics leakage current is higher than current ﬂow over insulation resistance
in ceramic or ﬁlm capacitors, the self-discharge of modern non solid electrolytic capacitors
takes several weeks.
A particular problem with electrolytic capacitors is storage time. Higher leakage current
can be the result of longer storage times. These behaviors are limited to electrolytes with a
high percentage of water. Organic solvents such as GBL299 do not have high leakage with
longer storage times.
Leakage current is normally measured 2 or 5 minutes after applying rated voltage.
7.10.13 Microphonics
All ferroelectric materials exhibit piezoelectricity300 a piezoelectric eﬀect. Because Class
2 ceramic capacitors use ferroelectric ceramics dielectric, these types of capacitors may
have electrical eﬀects called microphonics301.
Microphonics (microphony) describes how
electronic components transform mechanical vibration302s into an undesired electrical sig-
nal (noise303).304 The dielectric may absorb mechanical forces from shock or vibration by
changing thickness and changing the electrode separation, aﬀecting the capacitance, which
in turn induces an AC current. The resulting interference is especially problematic in audio
applications, potentially causing feedback or unintended recording.
In the reverse microphonic eﬀect, varying the electric ﬁeld between the capacitor plates
exerts a physical force, turning them into an audio speaker. High current impulse loads or
high ripple currents can generate audible sound from the capacitor itself, draining energy
and stressing the dielectric.305
7.10.14 Dielectric absorption (soakage)
Main Page: Dielectric absorption306
Dielectric absorption occurs when a capacitor that has remained charged for a long time
discharges only incompletely when brieﬂy discharged. Although an ideal capacitor would
reach zero volts after discharge, real capacitors develop a small voltage from time-delayed

capacitor analog-to-digital converter313s, and very low-distortion ﬁlter314s, it is important
that the capacitor does not recover a residual charge after full discharge, and capacitors
with low absorption are speciﬁed.315 The voltage at the terminals generated by the dielec-
tric absorption may in some cases possibly cause problems in the function of an electronic
circuit or can be a safety risk to personnel. In order to prevent shocks most very large
capacitors are shipped with shorting wires that need to be removed before they are used.316

Capacitors
The separation of the electrodes and the voltage proof of the dielectric material deﬁnes the
breakdown voltage of the capacitor. The breakdown voltage is proportional to the thickness
of the dielectric.
Theoretically, given two capacitors with the same mechanical dimensions and dielectric, but
one of them have half the thickness of the dielectric. With the same dimensions this one
could place twice the parallel-plate area inside. This capacitor has theoretically 4 times the
capacitance as the ﬁrst capacitor but half of the voltage proof.
Since the energy density stored in a capacitor is given by:
Estored = 1
2CV 2,
thus a capacitor having a dielectric half as thick as another has 4 times higher capacitance
but ½ voltage proof, yielding an equal maximum energy density.
Therefore, dielectric thickness does not aﬀect energy density within a capacitor of ﬁxed
overall dimensions. Using a few thick layers of dielectric can support a high voltage, but
low capacitance, while thin layers of dielectric produce a low breakdown voltage, but a
higher capacitance.
This assumes that neither the electrode surfaces nor the permittivity of the dielectric change
with the voltage proof. A simple comparison with two existing capacitor series can show
whether reality matches theory. The comparison is easy, because the manufacturers use
standardized case sizes or boxes for diﬀerent capacitance/voltage values within a series.

increases clearly. For ﬁlm capacitors the permittivity changes with dielectric thickness and
other mechanical parameters so that the deviation from the theory has other reasons.319
Comparing the capacitors from the table with a supercapacitor, the highest energy density
capacitor family. For this, the capacitor 25 F/2.3 V in dimensions D × H = 16 mm ×
26 mm from Maxwell HC Series, compared with the electrolytic capacitor of approximately
equal size in the table.
This supercapacitor has roughly 5000 times higher capacitance
than the 4700/10 electrolytic capacitor but ¼ of the voltage and has about 66,000 mWs
(0.018 Wh) stored electrical energy,320 approximately 100 times higher energy density (40
to 280 times) than the electrolytic capacitor.
7.10.16 Long time behavior, aging
Electrical parameters of capacitors may change over time during storage and application.
The reasons for parameter changings are diﬀerent, it may be a property of the dielectric,
environmental inﬂuences, chemical processes or drying-out eﬀects for non-solid materials.

Capacitors
In ferroelectric321 Class 2 ceramic capacitors, capacitance decreases over time. This behavior
is called ”aging”. This aging occurs in ferroelectric dielectrics, where domains of polarization
in the dielectric contribute to the total polarization. Degradation of polarized domains in
the dielectric decreases permittivity and therefore capacitance over time.322323 The aging
follows a logarithmic law. This deﬁnes the decrease of capacitance as constant percentage
for a time decade after the soldering recovery time at a deﬁned temperature, for example,
in the period from 1 to 10 hours at 20 °C. As the law is logarithmic, the percentage loss of
capacitance will twice between 1 h and 100 h and 3 times between 1 h and 1,000 h and so
on. Aging is fastest near the beginning, and the absolute capacitance value stabilizes over
time.
The rate of aging of Class 2 ceramic capacitors depends mainly on its materials. Generally,
the higher the temperature dependence of the ceramic, the higher the aging percentage.
The typical aging of X7R ceramic capacitors is about 2.5&nbs;% per decade.324 The aging
rate of Z5U ceramic capacitors is signiﬁcantly higher and can be up to 7% per decade.
The aging process of Class 2 ceramic capacitors may be reversed by heating the component
above the Curie point325.
Class 1 ceramic capacitors and ﬁlm capacitors do not have ferroelectric-related aging. Envi-
ronmental inﬂuences such as higher temperature, high humidity and mechanical stress can,
over a longer period, lead to a small irreversible change in the capacitance value sometimes
called aging, too.
The change of capacitance for P 100 and N 470 Class 1 ceramic capacitors is lower than
1%, for capacitors with N 750 to N 1500 ceramics it is ≤2%. Film capacitors may lose
capacitance due to self-healing processes or gain it due to humidity inﬂuences. Typical
changes over 2 years at 40 °C are, for example, ±3 % for PE ﬁlm capacitors and ±1 % PP
ﬁlm capacitors.

Capacitor - Electrical characteristics
Life time
Figure 89
The electrical values of electrolytic capacitors with non-solid electrolyte
changes over the time due to evaporation of electrolyte. Reaching speciﬁed limits of the
parameters the capacitors will be count as ”wear out failure”.
Electrolytic capacitors with non-solid electrolyte age as the electrolyte evaporates. This
evaporation depends on temperature and the current load the capacitors experience. Elec-
trolyte escape inﬂuences capacitance and ESR. Capacitance decreases and the ESR increases
over time. In contrast to ceramic, ﬁlm and electrolytic capacitors with solid electrolytes,
”wet” electrolytic capacitors reach a speciﬁed ”end of life” reaching a speciﬁed maximum
change of capacitance or ESR. End of life, ”load life” or ”lifetime” can be estimated either
by formula or diagrams326 or roughly by a so-called ”10-degree-law”. A typical speciﬁca-
tion for an electrolytic capacitor states a lifetime of 2,000 hours at 85 °C, doubling for
every 10 degrees lower temperature, achieving lifespan of approximately 15 years at room
temperature.
Supercapacitors also experience electrolyte evaporation over time. Estimation is similar
to wet electrolytic capacitors.
Additional to temperature the voltage and current load
inﬂuence the life time. Lower voltage than rated voltage and lower current loads as well as
lower temperature extend the life time.

Capacitors are reliable327 components with low failure rate328s, achieving life expectancies
of decades under normal conditions. Most capacitors pass a test at the end of production
similar to a ”burn in329”, so that early failures are found during production, reducing the
number of post-shipment failures.
Reliability for capacitors is usually speciﬁed in numbers of Failures In Time330 (FIT) during
the period of constant random failures. FIT is the number of failures that can be expected
in one billion (109) component-hours of operation at ﬁxed working conditions (e.g. 1000

7.11 Additional information
7.11.1 Soldering
Capacitors may experience changes to electrical parameters due to environmental inﬂuences
like soldering, mechanical stress factors (vibration, shock) and humidity. The greatest stress
factor is soldering. The heat of the solder bath, especially for SMD capacitors, can cause
ceramic capacitors to change contact resistance between terminals and electrodes; in ﬁlm
capacitors, the ﬁlm may shrink, and in wet electrolytic capacitors the electrolyte may boil.
A recovery period enables characteristics to stabilize after soldering; some types may require
up to 24 hours. Some properties may change irreversibly by a few per cent from soldering.
7.11.2 Electrolytic behavior from storage or disuse
Electrolytic capacitors with non-solid electrolyte are ”aged” during manufacturing by apply-
ing rated voltage at high temperature for a suﬃcient time to repair all cracks and weaknesses
that may have occurred during production. Some electrolytes with a high water content
react quite aggressively or even violently with unprotected aluminum. This leads to a ”stor-
age” or ”disuse” problem of electrolytic capacitors manufactured before the 1980s. Chemical
processes weaken the oxide layer when these capacitors are not used for too long. New
electrolytes with ”inhibitors” or ”passivators” were developed during the 1980s to solve this
problem.333334 As of 2012 the standard storage time for electronic components of two years
at room temperature substantiates (cased) by the oxidation of the terminals will be spec-
iﬁed for electrolytic capacitors with non-solid electrolytes, too. Special series for 125 °C
with organic solvents like GBL335 are speciﬁed up to 10 years storage time ensure without
pre-condition the proper electrical behavior of the capacitors.336
For antique radio equipment, ”pre-conditioning” of older electrolytic capacitors may be rec-
ommended. This involves applying the operating voltage for some 10 minutes over a current

7.11.5 Markings
Imprinted
Capacitors, like most other electronic components and if enough space is available, have
imprinted markings to indicate manufacturer, type, electrical and thermal characteristics,
and date of manufacture. If they are large enough the capacitor is marked with:
• manufacturer’s name or trademark;
• manufacturer’s type designation;
• polarity of the terminations (for polarized capacitors)
• rated capacitance;
• tolerance on rated capacitance
• rated voltage and nature of supply (AC or DC)
• climatic category or rated temperature;
• year and month (or week) of manufacture;
• certiﬁcation marks of safety standards (for safety EMI/RFI suppression capacitors)
Polarized capacitors have polarity markings, usually ”-” (minus) sign on the side of the
negative electrode for electrolytic capacitors or a stripe or ”+” (plus) sign, see #Polarity
marking340. Also, the negative lead for leaded ”wet” e-caps is usually shorter.
Smaller capacitors use a shorthand notation. The most commonly used format is: XYZ
J/K/M VOLTS V, where XYZ represents the capacitance (calculated as XY × 10Z pF), the
letters J, K or M indicate the tolerance (±5%, ±10% and ±20% respectively) and VOLTS
V represents the working voltage.
Examples:
• 105K 330V implies a capacitance of 10 × 105 pF = 1 µF (K = ±10%) with a working
voltage of 330 V.
• 473M 100V implies a capacitance of 47 × 103 pF = 47 nF (M = ±20%) with a working
voltage of 100 V.
Capacitance, tolerance and date of manufacture can be indicated with a short code speciﬁed
in IEC/EN 60062. Examples of short-marking of the rated capacitance (microfarads): µ47
= 0,47 µF, 4µ7 = 4,7 µF, 47µ = 47 µF
The date of manufacture is often printed in accordance with international standards.
• Version 1: coding with year/week numeral code, ”1208” is ”2012, week number 8”.
• Version 2: coding with year code/month code. The year codes are: ”R” = 2003, ”S”=
2004, ”T” = 2005, ”U” = 2006, ”V” = 2007, ”W” = 2008, ”X” = 2009, ”A” = 2010, ”B” =
2011, ”C” = 2012, ”D” = 2013, etc. Month codes are: ”1” to ”9” = Jan. to Sept., ”O” =
October, ”N” = November, ”D” = December. ”X5” is then ”2009, May”
For very small capacitors like MLCC chips no marking is possible. Here only the traceability
of the manufacturers can ensure the identiﬁcation of a type.

8 Inductors
8.1 Inductor
An inductor is a passive electronic component dependent on frequency used to store electric
energy in the form of a magnetic ﬁeld. An inductor has the symbol
Figure 102
8.2 Inductance
Inductance is the characteristic of the Inductor to generates a magnetic ﬁeld for a given
current. Inductance has a letter symbol L and measured in units of Henry (H).
L = B
I
This section list formulas for inductances in speciﬁc situations. Beware that some of the
equations are in Imperial units.
The permeability of free space, µ0 , is constant and is deﬁned to be exactly equal to 4π
×10-7 H m-1.
8.2.1 Basic inductance formula for a cylindrical coil
L = µ0µrN2A
l
L = inductance / H
µr = relative permeability of core material
N = number of turns
A = area of cross-section of the coil / m2
l = length of coil / m

Lself = self inductance / H(?)
b = wire length /m
a = wire radius /m
µr = relative permeability of wire
If you make the assumption that b >> a and that the wire is nonmagnetic (µr = 1), then
this equation can be approximated to
Lself = µ0b

(for high frequencies due to the skin eﬀect1)
L = inductance / H
b = wire length / m
a = wire radius / m
The inductance of a straight wire is usually so small that it is neglected in most practical
problems. If the problem deals with very high frequencies (f > 20 GHz), the calculation
may become necessary. For the rest of this book, we will assume that this self-inductance
is negligible.
8.2.3 Inductance of a short air core cylindrical coil in terms of
geometric parameters:
L =

L = inductance in µH
r = mean radius of coil in inches
l = physical length of coil winding in inches
N = number of turns
d = depth of coil in inches (i.e., outer radius minus inner radius)
8.2.5 Flat spiral air core coil
L =
r2N2
(2r+2.8d)×105
L = inductance / H
r = mean radius of coil / m
N = number of turns
d = depth of coil / m (i.e. outer radius minus inner radius)
Hence a spiral coil with 8 turns at a mean radius of 25 mm and a depth of 10 mm would
have an inductance of 5.13µH.

8.2.7 Quality of good inductor
There are several important properties for an inductor that may need to be considered when
choosing one for use in an electronic circuit. The following are the basic properties of a coil
inductor. Other factors may be important for other kinds of inductor, but these are outside
the scope of this article.
Current carrying capacity is determined by wire thickness and resistivity.
The quality factor, or Q-factor, describes the energy loss in an inductor due to imperfection
in the manufacturing.
The inductance of the coil is probably most important, as it is what makes the inductor
useful. The inductance is the response of the inductor to a changing current.
The inductance is determined by several factors.
Coil shape: short and squat is best
Core material
The number of turns in the coil. These must be in the same direction, or they will cancel
out, and you will have a resistor.
Coil diameter. The larger the diameter (core area) the larger the induction.
8.2.8 Coil’s Characteristics
For a Coil that has the following dimension
Figure 103
142

Inductance
Area enclosed by each turn of the coil is A
Length of the coil is ’l’
Number of turns in the coil is N
Permeability of the core is µ . µ is given by the permeability of free space, µ0 multiplied
by a factor, the relative permeability, µr
The current in the coil is ’i’
The magnetic ﬂux density, B , inside the coil is given by:
B = Nµi
l
We know that the ﬂux linkage in the coil, λ, is given by;
λ = NBA
Thus,
λ = N2Aµ
l
i
The ﬂux linkage in an inductor is therefore proportional to the current, assuming that A,
N, l and µ all stay constant. The constant of proportionality is given the name inductance
(measured in Henries) and the symbol L :
λ = Li
Taking the derivative with respect to time, we get:
dλ
dt = Ldi
dt +idL
dt
Since L is time-invariant in nearly all cases, we can write:
dλ
dt = Ldi
dt
Now, Faraday’s Law of Induction states that:
−E = N dΦ
dt = dλ
dt
We call −E the electromotive force (emf) of the coil, and this is opposite to the voltage v
across the inductor, giving:
143

Inductors
v = Ldi
dt
This means that the voltage across an inductor is equal to the rate of change of the current
in the inductor multiplied by a factor, the inductance. note that for a constant current, the
voltage is zero, and for an instantaneous change in current, the voltage is inﬁnite (or rather,
undeﬁned). This applies only to ideal inductors which do not exist in the real world.
This equation implies that
• The voltage across an inductor is proportional to the derivative of the current through
the inductor.
• In inductors, voltage leads current.
• Inductors have a high resistance to high frequencies, and a low resistance to low frequen-
cies. This property allows their use in ﬁltering signals.
An inductor works by opposing current change. Whenever an electron is accelerated, some
of the energy that goes into ”pushing” that electron goes into the electron’s kinetic energy,
but much of that energy is stored in the magnetic ﬁeld. Later when that or some other
electron is decelerated (or accelerated the opposite direction), energy is pulled back out of
the magnetic ﬁeld.
8.3 Inductor and Direct Current Voltage (DC)
When connect a Coil of several turns to an Electricity source in a closed loop . The current
in the circuit set up a Magnetic Field that has the same properties like a Magnetic Field of
a Magnet
B = L I
When the current is turned oﬀ, the Magnetic Field does not exist .
B = 0
Conducting Coil is called ElectroMagnet

9 Other Components
9.0.1 Ideal voltage sources
Figure 106
An ideal voltage source is a fundamental electronics component that creates a constant
voltage between two points regardless of whatever else is connected to it. Since it is ideal,
149

Other Components
some circuit conﬁgurations are not allowed, such as short circuits, which would create
inﬁnite current. (I = V / 0)
A water analogy would be a pump with pressure sensors on both sides. The diﬀerence in
pressure between the in port and out port is constantly measured, regardless of the absolute
pressure of each side, and the pump speed is adjusted so that the pressure diﬀerence stays
constant.
Real voltage sources, such as batteries, power supplies, piezoelectric disks, generators,
steam turbines, wall outlets, etc. have an internal source impedance (in series with the
ideal voltage source), which is very important to understand.
9.0.2 Ideal current sources

See Also
An ideal current source is atronics component that creates a constant current through a
section of circuit, regardless of whatever else is connected to it. Since it is ideal, some
circuit conﬁgurations are not allowed, such as open circuits, which would create an inﬁnite
voltage.
A water analogy would be a pump with a ﬂow meter. It measures the amount of water
ﬂowing by per unit time and changes the speed of the pump so that the current ﬂow is
constant.
Real current sources, such as batteries, power supplies, piezoelectric disks, generators, etc.
have an internal source impedance (in parallel with the source), which is very important
to understand.
Real sources generally behave more like voltage sources than current sources, because the
internal impedance in series is very low. A current source can be created from a voltage
source with a circuit such as a current mirror .
9.0.3 Dependent Sources
A dependent source is either a voltage or a current source which is dependent upon another
value within the circuit, usually another voltage or current. Typically, these are used in
circuit modeling and analysis.
There are four main types of such sources.
Voltage-controlled voltage source (VCVS)
This is a voltage source whose value is controlled by another voltage elsewhere in the
circuit. Its output will typically be given as Vo = AVc, where A is a gain term and Vcis a
control voltage.
An example of a VCVS may be an idealized ampliﬁer1, where A is the gain of the ampliﬁer.
Current-controlled voltage source (CCVS)
This is a voltage source whose value is controlled by a current elsewhere in the circuit. Its
output is typically given as Vo = AIc, where A is a gain term and Ic is a control current.
Voltage-controlled current source (VCCS)
This is a current source whose value is controlled by a voltage elsewhere in the circuit. Its
output is typically given as Io = AVc, where A is a gain term and Vc is a control voltage.

Other Components
Current-controlled current source (CCCS)
This is a current source whose value is controlled by a current elsewhere in the circuit. Its
output is typically given as Io = AIc, where A is a gain term and Ic is a control current.
An example of a CCCS is an idealized bipolar junction transistor2, which may be thought
of as a small current controlling a larger one. Speciﬁcally the base current, Ib is the control
and the collector current Ic is the output.
9.0.4 Switch
A switch is a mechanical device that connects or disconnects two parts of a circuit.
Figure 108
A switch is a short circuit when it is on.
Figure 109
And it is a open circuit when it is oﬀ.
When you turn a switch on it completes a circuit that allows current to ﬂow. When you
turn the switch oﬀit creates an air gap (depending on the type of switch), and since air is
an insulator no current ﬂows.
A switch is a device for making or breaking an electric circuit.
Usually the switch has two pieces of metal called contacts that touch to make a circuit,
and separate to break the circuit.
The contact material is chosen for its resistance to
corrosion, because most metals form insulating oxides that would prevent the switch from
working. Sometimes the contacts are plated with noble metals. They may be designed to
wipe against each other to clean oﬀany contamination. Nonmetallic conductors, such as
conductive plastic, are sometimes used. The moving part that applies the operating force
to the contacts is called the actuator, and may be a rocker, a toggle or dolly, a push-button
or any type of mechanical linkage.
Contact Arrangements
Switches can be classiﬁed according to the arrangement of their contacts. Some contacts
are normally open until closed by operation of the switch, while normally closed contacts
are opened by the switch action. A switch with both types of contact is called a changeover
switch.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_junction_transistor
152

See Also
The terms pole and throw are used to describe switch contacts. A pole is a set of contacts
that belong to a single circuit. A throw is one of two or more positions that the switch
can adopt. These terms give rise to the following abbreviations.
Figure 110
• S (single), D (double).
• T (throw), CO (changeover).
• CO = DT.
(single|double) pole ((single|double) throw|changeover)
• SPST = single pole single throw, a simple on-oﬀswitch.
• SPDT = single pole double throw, a simple changeover or on-oﬀ-on switch.
• SPCO = single pole changeover, equivalent to SPDT.
• DPST = double pole single throw, equivalent to two SPST switches controlled by a
single mechanism.
• DPDT = double pole double throw, equivalent to two SPDT switches controlled by a
single mechanism.
• DPCO = double pole changeover, equivalent to DPDT.
Switches with larger numbers of poles or throws can be described by replacing the ”S” or
”D” with a number.
Biased Switches
A biased switch is one containing a spring that returns the actuator to a certain position.
The ”on-oﬀ” notation can be modiﬁed by placing parentheses around all positions other
than the resting position. For example, an (on)-oﬀ-(on) switch can be switched on by
moving the actuator in either direction away from the centre, but returns to the central
oﬀposition when the actuator is released.
The momentary push-button switch is a type of biased switch. This device makes contact
when the button is pressed and breaks when the button is released.
153

Other Components
Special Types
Switches can be designed to respond to any type of mechanical stimulus: for example,
vibration (the trembler switch), tilt, air pressure, ﬂuid level (the ﬂoat switch), the turning
of a key (key switch), linear or rotary movement (the limit switch or microswitch).
The mercury tilt switch consists of a blob of mercury inside a glass bulb. The two contacts
pass through the glass, and are shorted together when the bulb is tilted to make the
mercury roll on to them. The advantage of this type of switch is that the liquid metal
ﬂows around particles of dirt and debris that might otherwise prevent the contacts of a
conventional switch from closing.

11 DC Voltage and Current Laws
11.1 Ohm’s Law
Ohm’s law describes the relationship between voltage, current, and resistance.Voltage and
current are proportional to the potential diﬀerence and inversely proportional to the resis-
tance of the circuit
V = I ·R
Voltage (V ) is measured in volts (V); Current (I ) in amperes (A); and resistance (R ) in
ohms (Ω).
Figure 111
In this example, the current going through any point in the circuit, I , will be equal to the
voltage V divided by the resistance R .
Figure 112
159

DC Voltage and Current Laws
In this example, the voltage across the resistor, V , will be equal to the supplied current, I
, times the resistance R .
If two of the values (V , I , or R ) are known, the other can be calculated using this formula.
Any more complicated circuit has an equivalent resistance that will allow us to calculate
the current draw from the voltage source. Equivalent resistance is worked out using the fact
that all resistors are either in parallel or series. Similarly, if the circuit only has a current
source, the equivalent resistance can be used to calculate the voltage dropped across the
current source.
11.2 Kirchoﬀ’s Voltage Law
Kirchoﬀ’s Voltage Law (KVL):
The sum of voltage drops around any loop in the circuit that starts and ends at the same
place must be zero.
11.3 Voltage as a Physical Quantity
1. Voltage is the potential diﬀerence between two charged objects.
2. Potentials can be added or subtracted in series to make larger or smaller potentials
as is commonly done in batteries.
3. Positive charge ﬂow from areas of high potential to lower potential.
4. All the components of a circuit have resistance that acts as a potential drop.
11.4 Kirchoﬀ’s Current Law
Kirchoﬀ’s Current Law (KCL):
The sum of all current entering a node must equal the sum of all currents leaving the node.

11.5 Consequences of KVL and KCL
Voltage Dividers
If two circuit elements are in series, there is a voltage drop across each element, but the
current through both must be the same. The voltage at any point in the chain divides
according to the resistances. A simple circuit with two (or more) resistors in series with a
source is called a voltage divider2.
Figure 115
Figure A: Voltage Divider circuit.
Consider the circuit in Figure A. According to KVL the voltage Vin is dropped across
resistors R1 and R2. If a current i ﬂows through the two series resistors then by Ohm’s
Law.
i =
Vin
R1 +R2
So
Vout = iR2
Therefore
Vout = VinR2
R1 +R2

In general for n series resistors the voltage dropped across one of them say Ri is
VRi = VinRi
Req
Where
Req = R1 +···+Rn
Voltage Dividers as References
Clearly voltage dividers can be used as references. If you have a 9 volt battery and you want
4.5 volts, then connect two equal valued resistors in series and take the reference across the
second and ground. There are clearly other concerns though, the ﬁrst concern is current
draw and the eﬀect of the source impedance. Clearly connecting two 100 ohm resistors is a
bad idea if the source impedance is, say, 50 ohms. Then the current draw would be 0.036
mA which is quite large if the battery is rated, say, 200 milliampere hours. The loading
is more annoying with that source impedance too, the reference voltage with that source
impedance is 9(100)
250
= 3.6 V. So clearly, increasing the order of the resistor to at least 1 kΩ
is the way to go to reduce the current draw and the eﬀect of loading. The other problem
with these voltage divider references is that the reference cannot be loaded if we put a 100
Ωresistor in parallel with a 10 kΩresistor. When the voltage divider is made of two 10 kΩ
resistors, then the resistance of the reference resistor becomes somewhere near 100 Ω. This
clearly means a terrible reference. If a 10 MΩresistor is used for the reference resistor will
still be some where around 10 kΩbut still probably less. The eﬀect of tolerances is also
a problem; if the resistors are rated 5% then the resistance of 10 kΩresistors can vary by
±500 Ω. This means more inaccuracy with this sort of reference.
Current Dividers
If two elements are in parallel, the voltage across them must be the same, but the current
divides according to the resistances. A simple circuit with two (or more) resistors in parallel
with a source is called a current divider3.

12 Nodal Analysis
12.1 Nodes
A node is a section of a circuit which connects components to each other. All of the current
entering a node must leave a node, according to Kirchoﬀ’s Current Law. Every point on
the node is at the same voltage, no matter how close it is to each component, because the
connections between components are perfect conductors. This voltage is called the node
voltage, and is the voltage diﬀerence between the node and an arbitrary reference, the
ground point. The ground point is a node which is deﬁned as having zero voltage. The
ground node should be chosen carefully for convenience. Note that the ground node does
not necessarily represent an actual connection to ground, it is just a device to make the
analysis simpler. For example, if a node has a voltage of 5 Volts, then the voltage drop
between that node and the ground node will be 5 Volts.
Note that in real circuits, nodes are made up of wires, which are not perfect conductors, and
so the voltage is not perfectly the same everywhere on the node. This distinction is only
important in demanding applications, such as low noise audio, high speed digital circuits
(like modern computers), etc. If we look at how a particular circuit functions an engineer
might be able to select check points that are diametrically apposite of each other, this
signaﬁes two points of current crossing over to another point this can be another method
in testing a circuit to determine how nodes work.
12.2 Nodal Analysis
Nodal analysis is a formalized procedure based on KCL equations.
Steps:
1. Identify all nodes.
2. Choose a reference node. Identify it with reference (ground) symbol. A good choice is
the node with the most branches, or a node which can immediately give you another
node voltage (e.g., below a voltage source).
3. Assign voltage variables to the other nodes (these are node voltages.)
4. Write a KCL equation for each node (sum the currents leaving the node and set equal
to zero). Rearrange these equations into the form A*V1+B*V2=C (or similar for
equations with more voltage variables.)
5. Solve the system of equations from step 4. There are a number of techniques that can
be used: simple substitution, Cramer’s rule, the adjoint matrix method, etc.
167

Nodal Analysis
12.3 Complications in Nodal Analysis
1. Dependent Current Source
Solution: Write KVL equations for each node.
Then express the extra variable
(whatever the current source depends on) in terms of node voltages. Rearrange into
the form from step 4 above. Solve as in step 5.
2. Independent Voltage Source
Problem: We know nothing about the current through the voltage source. We cannot
write KCL equations for the nodes the voltage source is connected to.
Solution: If the voltage source is between the reference node and any other node,
we have been given a ’free’ node voltage: the node voltage must be equal to the
voltage source value! Otherwise, use a ’super-node’, consisting of the source and the
nodes it is connected to. Write a KCL equation for all current entering and leaving
the super-node. Now we have one equation and two unknowns (the node voltages).
Another equation that relates these voltages is the equation provided by the voltage
source (V2-V1=source value). This new system of equations can be solved as in Step
5 above.
3. Dependent Voltage Source
Solution: Same as an independent voltage source, with an extra step. First write a
super-node KCL equation. Then write the source controlling quantity (dependence
quantity?)
in terms of the node voltages.
Rearrange the equation to be in the
A*V1+B*V2=C form. Solve the system as above.
12.4 Example
Given the Circuit below, ﬁnd the voltages at all nodes.
168

Example

node 0: V0 = 0V (deﬁned as ground node)
node 1: V1 = 9V (free node voltage)
node 2: V1−V2
1k
= V2−V0
3k
+ V2−V3
2k
node 3: V2−V3
2k
= V3−V0
2k
which results in the following system of linear equations:
{
+11V2
−3V3

−2V3

therefore, the solution is:



V0 = 0.00V
V1 = 9.00V

Another solution with KCL would be to solve node in terms of node 2;
V2−9V
1k

3k + V2
4k = 0

13 Mesh Analysis
13.1 Meshes
A ’mesh’ (also called a loop) is simply a path through a circuit that starts and ends at the
same place. For the purpose of mesh analysis, a mesh is a loop that does not enclose other
loops.
13.2 Mesh Analysis
Similar to nodal analysis, mesh analysis is a formalized procedure based on KVL equations.
A caveat: mesh analysis can only be used on ’planar’ circuits (i.e. there are no crossed, but
unconnected, wires in the circuit diagram.)
Steps:
1. Draw circuit in planar form (if possible.)
2. Identify meshes and name mesh currents. Mesh currents should be in the clockwise
direction. The current in a branch shared by two meshes is the diﬀerence of the two
mesh currents.
3. Write a KVL equation in terms of mesh currents for each mesh.
4. Solve the resulting system of equations.
13.3 Complication in Mesh Analysis
1. Dependent Voltage Sources
Solution: Same procedure, but write the dependency variable in terms of mesh currents.
2. Independent Current Sources
Solution: If current source is not on a shared branch, then we have been given one of the
mesh currents! If it is on a shared branch, then use a ’super-mesh’ that encircles the problem
branch. To make up for the mesh equation you lose by doing this, use the mesh current
relationship implied by the current source (i.e. I2 −I1 = 4mA).
3. Dependent Current Sources
Solution: Same procedure as for an independent current source, but with an extra step
to eliminate the dependency variable.
Write the dependency variable in terms of mesh
currents.
171

Mesh Analysis
13.4 Example
Given the Circuit below, ﬁnd the currents I1, I2.
Figure 118
The circuit has 2 loops indicated on the diagram. Using KVL we get:
Loop1: 0 = 9−1000I1 −3000(I1 −I2)
Loop2: 0 = 3000(I1 −I2)−2000I2 −2000I2
Simplifying we get the simultaneous equations:
0 = 9−4000I1 +3000I2
0 = 0+3000I1 −7000I2
solving to get:
I1 = 3.32mA
172

Example
I2 = 1.42mA

14 Thevenin and Norton Equivalent
Circuits
14.1 Source Transformation
Any linear time invariant network of impedances can be reduced to one equivalent
impedance.
In particular, any network of sources and resistors can be reduced to one
ideal source and one resistor, in either the Thevenin or Norton conﬁgurations. In this way,
a complicated network attached to a load resistor can be reduced to a single voltage divider
(Thevenin) or current divider (Norton).
Figure 119
Thevenin and Norton equivalents let you replace a Voltage source in series with a resis-
tor by a current source in parallel with a resistor, or vice versa. This is called a source
transformation.
The point to be noted is that the block that is replaced with such an equivalent should be
linear and time invariant, i.e. a linear change in the electrical source in that block produces
a linear change in the equivalent source, and the behavior can be replicated if the initial
conditions are replicated. The above shown transformation ﬁgures are true only if
the circuit contains at least one independent voltage or current source. If the
circuit comprises only dependent sources then Thevenin equivalent consists of
RTh alone
14.2 Thevenin Equivalents
The Thevenin equivalent circuit of a (two-terminal) network consists of a voltage source
in series with a resistor. The Thevenin equivalent will have the same output voltage and
current regardless of what is attached to the terminals.
175

Thevenin and Norton Equivalent Circuits
14.3 Techniques For Finding Thevenin Equivalents
• Network contains no sources (only resistors): The Thevenin resistance is equal to the
equivalent resistance of the network. The Thevenin voltage is zero.
• Basic: Works for any network except one with no independent sources. Find the voltage
across the terminals (with positive reference at terminal A) when they are open-circuited.
Find the current from terminal A to terminal B when they are short-circuited. Then
Rth = Voc
Isc
The Thevenin voltage source value is equivalent to the open-circuit voltage.
If the network has no dependent sources, the independent sources can be zeroed, and the
Thevenin resistance is equal to the equivalent resistance of the network with zeroed sources.
Then, ﬁnd Voc.
• Only Dependent Sources:
If the network has only dependent sources, either attach a test voltage source to the terminal
points and measure the current that passes from the positive terminal, or attach a test
current source to the terminal points and measure the voltage diﬀerence across the terminals.
In both cases you will have values for Voc and Isc, allowing you to use the Rth = Voc
Isc relation
to ﬁnd the Thevenin resistance.
14.4 Norton Equivalents
Norton equivalents can be found by performing a source transformation on the Thevenin
equivalent. The Norton Equivalent of a Thevenin Equivalent consists of a current source,
IN = Vth
Rth in parallel with Rth.
176

Thevenin and Norton Equivalent
14.5 Thevenin and Norton Equivalent
Figure 120
Figure 1: Circuit for the
determination of Equivalents
The steps for creating the Equivalent are:
1. Remove the load circuit.
2. Calculate the voltage, V, at the output from the original sources.
3. Now replace voltage sources with shorts and current sources with open circuits.
4. Replace the load circuit with an imaginary ohm meter and measure the total resistance,
R, looking back into the circuit, with the sources removed.
5. The equivalent circuit is a voltage source with voltage V in series with a resistance R
in series with the load.
The Thevenin Equivalent is determined with R2 as the load as shown in Figure 1. The ﬁrst
step is to open circuit R2. Then the voltage v is calculated with R2 open circuited must be
calculated. The voltage across R2 is V1 this is because no current ﬂows in the circuit so the
voltage across R2 must be V1 by KVL.
Since this circuit does not contain any dependent sources, all that needs to be done is for
all the Independent Voltage sources to be shorted and for all Independent Current Sources
to be open circuited. This results in the circuit shown in Figure 2.
177

Thevenin and Norton Equivalent Circuits
Figure 121
Figure 2: Circuit for the
Equivalent Resistance
Now the Thevenin Resistance is calculated looking into the two nodes.
The Thevenin
resistance is clearly R1 + R3||R4. The Thevenin Equivalent is shown in Figure 3 and Rth
and Vth have the values shown below.
Rth = R1 +R3||R4 (1)
Vth = V1

Circuit
If R2 = R1 = 6kΩand R3 = R4 = 2kΩand V1 = 15V then
Rth = 1k +4k||4k
Rth = 6kΩ
As a ﬁnal note if the voltage across R2 is calculate by Voltage Divider Rule using the
Thevenin Equivalent circuit in Figure 3.
VR2 =
VthR2
Rth+R2 (3)
If the value of Rth form equation 1 is substituted into equation 3.
VR2 =
VthR2
R1+R3||R4+R2 (4)
Now look at Figure 1 and calcute VR2 by voltage divider rule it has the same value as
equation 4. If the current through R2 is calculated in Figure 4 by current divider rule.
IR2 =
INRth
Rth +R2
(5)
Substituting equation 2 into 5.
IR2 =
Vth
Rth +R2
(4)
If equation 4 and Ohm’s Law are used to get the voltage across R2 equation 3 is reached.
Please note: The ”||”, a symbol that is used as an operator here, holds higher precedence
than the ”+” operator. As such, it is evaluated before a sum.
See Norton’s theorem1 and Thevenin’s theorem2 for more examples.

Figure 124

Figure 125
(b)
181

Superposition
Figure 126
(c)
Figure 1: The circuits showing the linearity of resistors.
Most basic electronic circuits are composed of linear elements. Linear elements are circuit
elements which follow Ohm’s Law. In Figure 1 (a) with independent voltage source, V1,
and resistor, R, a current i 1 ﬂows. The current i 1 has a value according to Ohm’s Law.
Similarly in Figure 1 (b) with independent voltage source, V2, and resistor, R, a current
i 2 ﬂows. In Figure 1 (c) with independent voltage sources, V1 and V2, and resistor, R,
a current i ﬂows. Using Ohm’s Law equation 1 is reached. If some simple algebra is used
then equation 2 is reached. But V1/R has a value i 1 and the other term is i 2 this gives
equation 3. This is basically what the Superposition Theorem states.
i = V1+V2
R
(1)
i = V1
R + V2
R (2)
i = i1 +i2 (3)
The Superposition Theorem states that the eﬀect of all the sources with corresponding
stimuli on a circuit of linear elements is equal to the algebraic sum of each individual
eﬀect. Each individual eﬀect is calculated by removing all other stimuli by replacing voltage
sources with short circuits and current sources with open circuits. Dependent sources can be
removed as long as the controlling stimuli is not set to zero. The process of calculating each
eﬀect with one stimulus connected at a time is continued until all the eﬀects are calculated.
If kth stimulus is denoted sk and the eﬀect created by sk denoted ek.
∑N
k=1 ek(4)
The steps for using superposition are as follows:
1. Calculate the eﬀect of each source in turn with all other independent voltage sources
short circuited and independent current sources open circuited.
2. Sum these eﬀects to get the complete eﬀect.
Note: the removal of each source is often stated diﬀerently as: replace each voltage source
with its internal resistance and each current with its internal resistance. This is identical to
182

Superposition Principle
what has been stated above. This is because a real voltage source consists of an independent
voltage source in series with its internal resistance and a real current source consists of an
independent current source in parallel with its internal resistance.
15.1.1 Superposition Example

Short circuit V1 and solve for v2. By voltage divider rule.
v2 =
V2(R1||R2)

17 Diagnostic and Testing Equipment
There is a wide array of devices used to test and diagnose electronic equipment.
This
chapter will attempt to explain the diﬀerences and diﬀerent types of equipment used by
electronics technicians and engineers.
17.1 Ammeter
An ammeter measures current.Current in electronics is usually measured in mA which are
called milliamperes, which are 1/1000s of an ampere.
. The ammeter’s terminals must be in series with the current being measured. Ammeters
have a small resistance (typically 50 ohms) so that they only have a small eﬀect on the
current.
Figure 128
187

Diagnostic and Testing Equipment
Basically an ammeter consists of a coil that can rotate inside a magnet, but a spring is
trying to push the coil back to zero. The larger the current that ﬂows through the coil,
the larger the angle of rotation, the torque (= a rotary force) created by the current being
counteracted by the return torque of the spring.
. Usually ammeters are connected in parallel with various switched resistors that can extend
the range of currents that can be measured. Assume, for example, that the basic ammeter
is ”1000 ohms per volt”, which means that to get the full-scale deﬂection of the pointer a
current of 1 mA is needed (1 volt divided by 1000 ohms is 1 mA - see ”Ohm’s Law”).
. To use that ammeter to read 10 mA full-scale it is shunted with another resistance, so
that when 10 mA ﬂows, 9 mA will ﬂow through the shunt, and only 1 mA will ﬂow through
the meter. Similarly, to extend the range of the ammeter to 100 mA the shunt will carry
99 mA, and the meter only 1 mA.
17.2 Ohmmeter
An ohmmeter measures resistance.The two terminals of ohmmeter are each placed on a
terminal of the resistance being measured. This resistance should be isolated from other
eﬀects. (It should be taken out of a circuit, if it is in one.)
Ohmmeters are basically ammeters that are connected to an internal battery, with a suitable
resistance in series . Assume that the basic ammeter is ”1000 ohms per volt”, meaning that
1 mA is needed for full-scale deﬂection. When the external resistance that is connected
to its terminals is zero (the leads are connected together at ﬁrst for calibration), then the
internal, variable, resistor in series with the ammeter is adjusted so that 1 mA will ﬂow;
that will depend on the voltage of the battery, and as the battery runs down that setting
will change. The full scale point is marked as zero resistance. If an external resistance is
then connected to the terminals that causes only half of the current to ﬂow (0.5 mA in this
example), then the external resistance will equal the internal resistance, and the scale is
marked accordingly. When no current ﬂows, the scale will read inﬁnity resistance. The scale
of an ohmmeter is NOT linear.Ohmmeters are usually usuful in cheking the short circuit
and open circuit in boards.
17.3 Voltmeter
A voltmeter measures voltage.The voltmeter’s terminals must be in parallel with the voltage
being measured. Voltmeters have a large resistance (typically 1 megaohm), so that they
only have a small eﬀect on the voltage.
188

Diagnostic and Testing Equipment
17.4 Multimeter
Figure 130
A multimeter is a combination device, (usually) capable of measuring current, resistance,
or voltage. Most modern models measure all three, and include other features such as a
diode tester, which can be used to measure continuity in circuits (emitting a loud ’beep’ if
there is a short).
17.5 Oscilloscope
An oscilloscope, commonly called a ’scope’ by technicians, is used to display a voltage
waveform on a screen, usually graphing voltage as a function of time.
190

Spectrum Analyzer

17.6 Spectrum Analyzer
Spectrum analyzer shows voltage (or power) densities as function of frequency on radio
frequency spectrum. Spectrum analyzer can use analog frequency scanning principle (like
radio receiver always changing frequency and measuring receiving amplitude) or digital
sampling and FFT (Fast Fourier Transformation).
Figure 132
191

Diagnostic and Testing Equipment
17.7 Logic analyzer
A logic analyzer is, in eﬀect, a specialised oscilloscope.
The key diﬀerence between an
analyzer and an oscilloscope is that the analyzer can only display a digital (on/oﬀ) waveform,
whereas an oscilloscope can display any voltage (depending on the type of probe connected).
The other diﬀerence is that logic analyzers tend to have many more signal inputs than
oscilloscopes - usually 32 or 64, versus the two channels most oscilloscopes provide. Logic
analyzers can be very useful for debugging complex logic circuits, where one signal’s state
may be aﬀected by many other signals.

192

Frequency counter
17.8 Frequency counter
A frequency counter is a relatively simple instrument used to measure the frequency of a
signal in Hertz (cycles per second). Most counters work by counting the number of signal
cycles that occur in a given time period (usually one second). This count is the frequency
of the signal in Hertz, which is displayed on the counter’s display.

A voltmeter with extremely high input resistance capable of measuring electrical charge
with minimal inﬂuence to that charge. Ubiquitous in nucleonics, physics and bio-medical
disciplines. Enables the direct veriﬁcation of charge measured in coulombs according to
Q=CV. Additionally, electrometers can generally measure current ﬂows in the femtoampere
range, i.e. .000000000000001 ampere.

18 DC Circuit Analysis
18.1 DC Circuit Analysis
In this chapter, capacitors and inductors will be introduced (without considering the eﬀects
of AC current.) The big thing to understand about Capacitors and Inductors in DC Circuits
is that they have a transient (temporary) response. During the transient period, capaci-
tors build up charge and stop the ﬂow of current (eventually acting like inﬁnite resistors.)
Inductors build up energy in the form of magnetic ﬁelds, and become more conductive. In
other words, in the steady-state (long term behavior), capacitors become open circuits and
inductors become short circuits. Thus, for DC analysis, you can replace a capacitor with
an empty space and an inductor with a wire. The only circuit components that remain are
voltage sources, current sources, and resistors.

Resistors
Figure 139
DC steady-state (meaning the circuit has been in the same state for a long time), we’ve
seen that capacitors act like open circuits and inductors act like shorts. The above ﬁgures
show the process of replacing these circuit devices with their DC equivalents. In this case,
all that remains is a voltage source and a lone resistor. (An AC analysis of this circuit can
be found in the AC section.)
18.3 Resistors
If a circuits contains only resistors possibly in a combination of parallel and series connec-
tions then an equivalent resistance is determined. Then Ohm’s Law is used to determine
the current ﬂowing in the main circuit. A combination of voltage and current divider rules
are then used to solve for other required currents and voltages.

then we use Ohm’s Law to solve for the current. In Figure 1 (b) if we are given R1, R2
and V then we combine the resistor into an equivalent resistors noting that are in series.
Then we solve for the current as before using Ohm’s Law. In Figure 1 (c) if the resistors
are labeled clockwise from the top resistor R1, R2 and R3 and the voltage source has the
value: V. The analysis proceeds as follows.
Req = R1 +R2 +R3

Resistors
This is the formula for calculating the equivalent resistance of series resistor. The current
is now calculated using Ohm’s Law.
i = V
Req
=
V
R1 +R2 +R3
If the voltage is required across the third resistor then we can use voltage divider rule.
VR3 =
V R3
R1 +R2 +R3
Or alternatively one could use Ohm’s Law together with the current just calculated.
VR3 = iR3 =
V R3
R1 +R2 +R3

Figure 2: Simple parallel circuits.
In Figure 2 (a) if the Resistor nearest the voltage source is R1 and the other resistor R2.
If we need to solve for the current i. then we proceed as before. First we calculate the
equivalent resistance then use Ohm’s Law to solve for the current. The resistance of a
parallel combination is:
Req =
R1R2
R1 +R2
So the current, i , ﬂowing in the circuit is, by Ohm’s Law:
i = V (R1 +R2)
R1R2
If we need to solve for current through R2 then we can use current divider rule.
iR2 = V (R1+R2)(R1)
(R1R2)(R1+R2) = V
R2 (1)
But it would probably have been simpler to have used the fact that V most be dropped
across R2. This means that we can simply use Ohm’s Law to calculate the current through
R2. The equation is just equation 1. In Figure 2 (b) we do exactly the same thing except
this time there are three resistors this means that the equivalent resistance will be:

Figure 3: Combined parallel and series circuits
In Figure 3 (a), if the three resistors in the outer loop of the circuit are R1, R2 and R3 and
the other resistor is R4. It is simpler to see what is going on if we combine R2 and R3 into
their series equivalent resistance R23. It is clear now that the equivalent resistance is R1
in series with the parallel combination of R23 and R4. If we want to calculate the voltage
across the parallel combination of R4 and R23 then we just use voltage divider.
V4||23 =
R4||(R2 +R3)V
R4||(R2 +R3)+R1
If we want to calculate the current through R2 and R3 then we can use the voltage across
R4||(R2 +R3) and Ohm’s law.
i23 =
R4||(R2 +R3)V
(R4||(R2 +R3)+R1)(R2 +R3)
204

Resistors
Or we could calculate the current in the main circuit and then use current divider rule to
get the current.
In Figure 3 (b) we take the same approach simplifying parallel combinations and series
combinations of resistors until we get the equivalent resistance.
In Figure 3 (c) this process doesn’t work then because there are resistors connected in a
delta this means that there is no way to simplify this beyond transforming them to a star
or wye connection.
Note: To calculate the current draw from the source the equivalent resistance always must
be calculated. But if we just need the voltage across a series resistor this may be necessary.
If we want to calculate the current in parallel combination then we must use either current
divider rule or calculate the voltage across the resistor and then use Ohm’s law to get the
current. The second method will often require less work since the current ﬂowing from the
source is required for the use of current divider rule. The use of current divider rule is much
simpler in the case when the source is a current source because the value of the current is
set by the current source.

We have seen that the series and parallel networks can be reduced by the use of simple
equations. Now we will derive similar relations to convert a star network to delta and vice
versa. Consider the points 1 and 2. The resistance between them in the star case is simply
R1 + R2
For the delta case, we have
R12 || (R31 + R23)
We have similar relations for the points 2, 3 and 3, 1. Making the substitution r1= R23 etc.,

20 Measuring Instruments
20.1 Ammeters
Ammeters are devices that measure current. Current in electronics is usually measured in
mA which are called milliamperes, which are 1/1000s of an ampere.
..... Basically an ammeter consists of a coil that can rotate inside a magnet, but a spring
is trying to push the coil back to zero. The larger the current that ﬂows through the coil,
the larger the angle of rotation, the torque (= a rotary force) created by the current being
counteracted by the return torque of the spring.
..... Usually ammeters are connected in parallel with various switched resistors that can
extend the range of currents that can be measured. Assume, for example, that the basic
ammeter is ”1000 ohms per volt”, which means that to get the full-scale deﬂection of the
pointer a current of 1 mA is needed (1 volt divided by 1000 ohms is 1 mA - see ”Ohm’s
Law”).
..... To use that ammeter to read 10 mA full-scale it is shunted with another resistance, so
that when 10 mA ﬂows, 9 mA will ﬂow through the shunt, and only 1 mA will ﬂow through
the meter. Similarly, to extend the range of the ammeter to 100 mA the shunt will carry
99 mA, and the meter only 1 mA.
20.2 Ohmmeters
Ohmmeters are basically ammeters that are connected to an internal battery, with a suitable
resistance in series . Assume that the basic ammeter is ”1000 ohms per volt”, meaning that
1 mA is needed for full-scale deﬂection. When the external resistance that is connected
to its terminals is zero (the leads are connected together at ﬁrst for calibration), then the
internal, variable, resistor in series with the ammeter is adjusted so that 1 mA will ﬂow;
that will depend on the voltage of the battery, and as the battery runs down that setting
will change. The full scale point is marked as zero resistance. If an external resistance is
then connected to the terminals that causes only half of the current to ﬂow (0.5 mA in
this example), then the external resistance will equal the internal resistance, and the scale
is marked accordingly. When no current ﬂows, the scale will read inﬁnity resistance. The
scale of an ohmmeter is NOT linear.Ohmmeters are usually useful in checking the short
circuit and open circuit in boards.

Multimeters contain Ohmeters, Voltmeters, Ammeters and a variety of capabilities to mea-
sure other quantities. AC and DC voltages are most often measurable. Frequency of AC
voltages. Multimeters also feature a continuity detector, basically an Ohmmeter with a
beeper if the multimeter sees less than 100 Ω then it beeps otherwise it is silent. This is
very useful for ﬁnding whether components are connected when debugging or testing cir-
cuits. Multimeters are also often able to measure capacitance and inductance. This may
be achieved using a Wien bridge. A diode tester is also generally onboard, this allows one
to determine the anode and cathode of an unknown diode. A LCD display is also provided
for easily reading of results.

Diﬀerential signaling is a method of transmitting information electrically by means of two
complementary signals sent on two separate wires. The technique can be used for both
analogue signaling, as in some audio systems, and digital signaling, as in RS-422, RS-485,
PCI Express and USB.
22.5.2 Good grounding
An ideal signal ground maintains zero voltage regardless of how much electrical current
ﬂows into ground or out of ground.
When low-level signals travel near high currents, their return currents shouldn’t be allowed
to ﬂow in the same conductor. Otherwise, noise such as AC ripple on the high current will
modulate the low-level signal.

23 AC Circuits
23.1 Relationship between Voltage and Current
23.1.1 Resistor
In a resistor, the current is in phase with the voltage always. This means that the peaks and
valleys of the two waveforms occur at the same times. Resistors can simply be deﬁned as
devices that perform the sole function of inhibiting the ﬂow of current through an electrical
circuit. Resistors are commercially available having various standard values, nevertheless
variable resistors are also made called potentiometers, or pots for short. In theory electricity
is a method used to harness myriad numbers including symbols to give the notion on how
circuits function on a schematic drawing
23.1.2 Capacitor
The capacitor is diﬀerent from the resistor in several ways. First, it consumes no real power.
It does however, supply reactive power to the circuit. In a capacitor, as voltage is increasing
the capacitor is charging. Thus a large initial current. As the voltage peaks the capacitor
is saturated and the current falls to zero. Following the peak the circuit reverses and the
charge leaves the capacitor. The next half of the cycle the circuit runs mirroring the ﬁrst
half.
The relationship between voltage and current in a capacitor is: i(t) = C d(v(t))
dt
. This is valid
not only in AC but for any function v(t). As a direct consequence we can state that in the
real world, the voltage across a capacitor is always a continuous function of the time.
If we apply the above formula to a AC voltage (i.e. v(t) = V ·sin(ωt+Φ)), we get for the
current a 90° phase shift: i(t) = V ·ω ·cos(ωt+Φ).
In an AC circuit, current leads voltage by a quarter phase or 90 degrees. Note that while in
DC circuits after the initial charge or discharge no current can ﬂow, in AC circuits a current
ﬂows all the time into and out of the capacitor, depending on the impedance1 in the circuit.
This is similar to the resistance2 in DC circuits, except that the impedance has 2 parts; the
resistance included in the circuit, and also the reactance3 of the capacitor, which depends
not only on the size of the capacitor, but also on the frequency4 of the applied voltage. In a

circuit that has DC applied plus a signal5, a capacitor can be used to block the DC, while
letting the signal continue.
23.1.3 Inductor
In inductors, current is the negative derivative of voltage, meaning that however the voltage
changes the current tries to oppose that change. When the voltage is not changing there is
no current and no magnetic ﬁeld.
In an AC Circuit, voltage leads current by a quarter phase or 90 degrees.
Voltage Deﬁned as the derivative of the ﬂux linkage:
V (t) = d(Ni(t))
dt
23.2 Resonance
A circuit containing resistors, capacitors, and inductors is said to be in resonance when
the reactance of the inductor cancels that of the capacitor to leave the resulting total
resistance of the circuit to be equal to the value of the component resistor. The resonance
state is achieved by ﬁne tuning the frequency of the circuit to a value where the resulting
impedance of the capacitor cancels that of the inductor, resulting in a circuit that appears
entirely resistive.
23.3 See also
AC Voltage:
When the Voltage between two points is changing continuously with time then the voltage
is called AC Voltage. For AC Voltages there will be no constant value so we deﬁne it by
the average value called RMS value RMS means Root Means Square. In retrospect on AC
the power that is used to theoretically determine by an unkown which we assume to be a
steady ﬂow, this is also what technicians label the ﬂuctuation of current that determines
how electricity moves in a diagram.

Phasors provide a simple means of analyzing linear circuits. At the heart of phasor analysis
lies Euler’s formula1:

• j is the Imaginary unit (j2 = −1).
• In electrical engineering, the imaginary unit is symbolized by j rather than the symbol i because i is used to
denote current in electrical engineering.
• The frequency of the wave, in Hz ˆ{http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Hertz} , is given by ω/2π.
224

Sinusoidal Signals
˜A = Aejθ is called a phasor. It contains information about the magnitude and phase of a
sinusoidal signal, but not the frequency or time. This simpliﬁes use in circuit analysis, since
most of the time, all quantities in the circuit will have the same frequency. (For circuits
with sources at diﬀerent frequencies, the principle of superposition must be used.)
A shorthand phasor notation is: ˜A = A∠θ
Note that this is simply a polar form, and can be converted to rectangular notation by (see
ﬁgure one):
˜A = Aejθ = A∠θ = Acosθ +jAsinθ
and back again by (see ﬁgure two):
˜A = X + jY =
√
X2 +Y 2∠tan−1 Y
X =
√
X2 +Y 2ej tan−1 Y
X .
Let us understand how this
process works, even though a phasor causes circuits to heat up steady ﬂow in current will
explain on a basis that disallows overheating. Since according to the formula the outcome
will be there is a time in duration which the current usage stays the same.
24.2 Sinusoidal Signals
To begin, we must ﬁrst understand what sinusoidal signals are. Sinusoidal signals can be
represented as
Acos(ωt+θ)
where A is the amplitude, ω is the frequency in radians per second, and θ is the phase angle
in degrees(phase shift). We can return to the sinusoidal signal by taking the real part of
Euler’s formula:
Acos(ωt+θ) = Re(Aej(ωt+θ))
For the moment, consider single-frequency circuits. Every steady state current and voltage
will have the same basic form:
˜Aiejωt where ˜Ai is a phasor. So we can ”divide through” by ejωt to get phasor circuit
equations. We can solve these equations for some phasor circuit quantity ˜Y , multiply by
ejωt, and convert back to the sinusoidal form to ﬁnd the time-domain sinusoidal steady-
state solution.
24.3 Example
We have three sinusoidal signals with the same frequency added together:
v(t) = 5cos(200t+30◦)+2cos(200t+45◦)+cos(200t−60◦)
225

Phasors
In phasor notation, this is:
˜V = 5ej30◦+2ej45◦+e−j60◦= 5∠30+2∠45+∠−60
We can combine these terms to get one phasor notation. This is done ﬁrst by separating
the real and imaginary components:
X: 5cos(30◦)+2cos(45◦)+cos(−60◦) ≈6.2443
Y: 5sin(30◦)+2sin(45◦)+sin(−60◦) ≈3.04819
The phasor notation can be written as:
˜V = 6.2443+j3.04819 =
√
6.24432 +3.048192∠tan−1 3.04819
6.2443
˜V = 6.94861∠26.0194
Back to the time domain, we get the answer:
v(t) = 6.94861cos(200t+26.0194◦)

25 Impedance
25.1 Deﬁnition
Impedance, ˜Z, is the quantity that relates voltage and current in the frequency domain.
(The tilde indicates a phasor1. An overscore or arrow may also be used.)
˜Z =
˜V
˜I = V ∠ϕV
I∠ϕI
= V
I ∠ϕV −ϕI
In rectangular form,
˜Z = R+jX
where R is the resistance and X is the reactance. Impedance is generally a function of
frequency, i.e.
˜Z(ω) = R(ω)+jX(ω)
NOTE: ω = 2 π f
where f is the frequency in cycles per second (f=50 or 60 Hertz usually, depending on the
country concerned. Aircraft systems often use 400 Hertz.)
25.1.1 Reactance
Reactance (symbol X) is the resistance to current ﬂow of a circuit element that can store
energy (i.e. a capacitor or an inductor), and is measured in ohms.
The reactance of an inductor of inductance L (in Henries), through which an alternating
current of angular frequency w ﬂows is given by:
XL = ωL
The reactance of a capacitor of capacitance C (in Farads) is given similarly:
XC = 1/(ωC)
1
Chapter 24 on page 223
227

Impedance
The two formulae for inductive reactance and capacitive reactance create interesting coun-
terpoints. Notice that for inductive reactance, as the frequency of the AC increases, so does
the reactance. Hence, higher frequencies result in lower current. The opposite is true of
capacitive reactance: The higher the frequency of AC, the less reactance a capacitor will
present.
Similarly, a more inductive inductor will present more reactance, while a capacitor with
more capacitance will yield less reactance.
25.2 Resistors
Resistors have zero reactance, since they do not store energy, so their impedance is simply
˜Z = R
25.3 Capacitors
Capacitors have zero resistance, but do have reactance. it is stored in the power of a circuit
or it can be also stored in a motor running oﬀa AC current. Their impedance is
˜Z =
1
jωC
where C is the capacitance in farads. The reactance of one microfarad at 50 Hz is -3183
ohms, and at 60 Hz it is -2653 ohms. In much more basic terms storing energy would be
equivalent to a battery the power source is active and stays in this manner without any
loss of power, this is what is regarded as a means for reversing electricity in the process of
keeping that current.
.
25.4 Inductors
Like capacitors, inductors have zero resistance, but have reactance. Their impedance is
˜Z = jωL
where L is the inductance in henries. The reactance of one henry at 50 Hz is 314 ohms, and
at 60 Hz it is 377 ohms.
228

Circuit Analysis Using Impedance
25.5 Circuit Analysis Using Impedance
Analysis in the frequency domain proceeds exactly like DC analysis, but all currents and
voltages are now phasors (and so have an angle).
Impedance is treated exactly like a
resistance, but is also a phasor (has an imaginary component/angle depending on the rep-
resentation.)
(In the case that a circuit contains sources with diﬀerent frequencies, the principle of su-
perposition2 must be applied.)
Note that this analysis only applies to the steady state3 response of circuits. For circuits
with transient characteristics, circuits must be analyzed in the Laplace domain, also known
as s-domain analysis.

26 Steady State
26.1 Steady State
That can be said to be the condition of ”rest”, after all the changes/alterations were made.
This may imply, for examples, that nothing at all happens, or that a ”steady” current ﬂows,
or that a circuit has ”settled down” to ﬁnal values - that is until the next disturbance occurs.
If the input signal is not time invariant, say if is a sinosoid, the steady state will not be
invariant either. The response of a systematic convergence can be considered to be composed
of a transient response: the response to a disturbance, and the steady state response, in the
absence of disturbance.
The transient part of the response tends to zero as time since a disturbance tends to inﬁnity,
so the steady state can be considered to be the response remaining as T -> inﬁnity.
. In this case we make an assumption for error we can determine by calculation the extent of
statistics how much power there is according to the formulae. Deducing the theory of certain
parts of a sinuous making plausible solution in understanding the intricate mechanism of a

31 Analog Circuits
As explained later, digital signals can only take one of two values at any one point. Analog
signals, however, can take any value within a range. In modern electronics, many tradition-
ally analog circuits are being replaced with digital ICs for various reasons:
• Reduced cost:
• Digital ICs can be programmed, meaning many diﬀerent analog circuits can each be
replaced with the same IC, reducing cost. For example, the same DSP chip might
replace many diﬀerent analog ﬁlters.
• Digital ICs can be easily expanded to put multiple functions on the same chip. For
example, a DSP chip replacing multiple analog ﬁlters at the same time.
• Digital ICs can be reprogrammed without modifying the circuit, simplifying prototyp-
ing and ﬁeld upgrades.
• Increased versatility:
• A digital IC can have its settings changed arbitrarily while it is being operated, these
settings can even be changed by software. The equivalent in an analog circuit might
require expensive and complicated switching techniques.
• Numeric precision: once a signal is converted to digital data, distortion and circuit noise
are no longer a signiﬁcant issue. A cheap modern watch driven by a digital circuit (such
as a quartz oscillator and a counter) is more precise than any analog or mechanical clock.
• Ease of storage: digital data, once recorded, does not degrade as easily as analog data.
Digital circuits are also becoming more prevalent where there are no analog analogues,
such as computers. Although analogue computers exist, their utility is severely limited by
comparison.
Analog circuits are still more suitable for many functions. One important category is inter-
faces. Digital circuits are usually inferior to analog circuits for receiving and transmitting
signals.
• A common digital interface, the diﬀerential line, needs an analog circuit to function well.
The receiver must ﬁlter out common mode interference by computing the analog diﬀerence
between the two lines. Most digital interfaces are designed as analog, only a few legacy
interfaces (which have poor performance) use entirely digital circuits.
• Many radio signals are simply too high frequency to work with existing digital circuits.
Radio modulators, demodulators, mixers, transmitters, and receivers are still analog.
Some signals are even too high frequency for transistor circuits of any kind to amplify
eﬃciently, such as microwave signals, which are still transmitted using vacuum tubes.
• Signals must be conditioned before conversion to digital to avoid aliasing: analog ﬁlters
remove unwanted parts of signals.
• Many devices, such as monitors, require analog control.
Even LCD monitors require
analog circuits, although they need not be as sophisticated as CRT analog circuits.
241

Analog Circuits
• Audio equipment requires analog circuits. Speakers must be driven by analog signals,
microphones produce analog signals. Signal of a microphone must be conditioned before
conversion to digital, this usually entails sophisticated analog circuits such as preamplifers,
compressors, and ﬁlters.
242

32 Vacuum Tubes
32.1 Passive Versus Active Components
Passive components have no gain and are not valves
• Voltage Regulator: an active component which accepts a range of voltages and
outputs one constant voltage.
32.2 Vacuum Tube equals Thermonic Valve
A Vacuum Tube is a container (usually of glass) from which the air is removed. Inside the
tube are two or more ”Elements”.
- Cathode: (electron emitter) has an electrically heated ﬁlament (which you can usually see
glow red ) which spits out electrons that travel through the vacuum to the Anode (electron
acceptor).
- Anode: Is a conductive (usually metal) plate that is connected to a positive voltage. The
negative electrons ﬂow from the Cathode to the Anode.
A vacuum tube with just Cathode and Anode elements is a DIODE. Current will ﬂow only
when the Anode has a positive voltage relative to the Cathode.
- Grid(s): metal gratings or grids are placed between the Cathode and Anode to produce
devices that can amplify signals.
NOTE: A tube with 3 elements (one grid) is a TRIODE, with 2 grids a TETRODE, with
3 grids a PENTODE.
A Grid between the cathode and anode controls the ﬂow of electrons. By applying a negative
voltage to the grid it is possible to control the ﬂow of electrons. This is the basis of the
Vacuum Tube ampliﬁer.
A problem with Vacuum Tubes is they are big, bulky, and often meant for applications
involving a lot of power. They are very powerful which usually being a Vacuum. How-
ever it is possible to scale up vacuum tubes to very high powers, and many high-powered
transmitters for broadcast FM and TV use vacuum power tubes.
Vacuum tube based ampliﬁers have largely been replaced by semiconductor transistor based
ampliﬁers, as they are low power and much more compact.
The voltage diﬀerence in the direction from the cathode to the anode is known as the forward
bias and is the normal operating mode. If the voltage applied to the Anode becomes negative
relative to the Cathode, no electrons will ﬂow. In electronics vacuum electron tube or valve

is a device that controls current. Through a vacuum in sealed container. Vacuum tubes
rely on thermionic emission of electrons from hot ﬁlament.
32.3 Klystron
A klystron is a vacuum tube used for production of microwave energy. This device is related
to but not the same as a magnetron. The klystron was invented after the magnetron.
Klystrons work using a principle known as velocity modulation.
The klystron is a long narrow vacuum tube. There is an electron gun (heater, cathode,
beam former) at one end and an anode at the other. In between is a series of donut shaped
resonant cavity structures positioned so that the electron beam passes through the hole.
The ﬁrst and last of the resonant cavities are electrically wired together.
At the cathode the electron beam is relatively smooth. There are natural slight increases
and decreases in the electron density of the beam. As the beam passes through the holes of
the resonant cavities, any changes in the electron beam cause some changes in the resting
electro magnetic (EM) ﬁeld of the cavities. The EM ﬁelds of the cavities begin to oscillate.
The oscillating EM ﬁeld of the cavities then has an eﬀect on the electrons passing through,
either slowing down or speeding up their passage.
As electrons are aﬀected by the EM ﬁeld of the ﬁrst cavity they change their speed. This
change in speed is called velocity modulation. By the time the electrons arrive at the last
cavity there are deﬁnite groups in the beam. The groups interact strongly with the last
cavity causing it to oscillate in a more pronounced way. Some of the last cavity’s energy
is tapped oﬀand fed back to the ﬁrst cavity to increase its oscillations. The stronger ﬁrst
cavity oscillations produce even stronger grouping of the electrons in the beam causing
stronger oscillations in that last cavity and so on. This is positive feedback.
The output microwave energy is tapped of for use in high power microwave devices such as
long range primary RADAR systems.
The klystron is a coherent microwave source in that it is possible to produce an output
with a constant phase. This is a useful attribute when combined with signal processing to
measure RADAR target attributes like Doppler shift.
Related microwave vacuum tubes are the Travelling Wave Tube (TWT) and the Travelling
Wave Ampliﬁer (TWA). A Hybrid device, which combines some aspects of these devices
and the klystron, is a device called a Twicetron.
32.4 Magnetron
Magnetrons are used to produce microwaves.
This is the original device used for production of microwaves and was invented during the
Second World War for use in RADAR equipment.
Magnetrons work using a principle known as velocity modulation.
244

Cathode Ray Tube
A circular chamber, containing the cathode, is surrounded by and connected to a number of
resonant cavities. The walls of the chamber are the anode. The cavity dimensions determine
the frequency of the output signal. A strong magnetic ﬁeld is passed through the chamber,
produced by a powerful magnet. The cathode is similar to most thermionic valves, except
heavy, rigid construction is necessary for power levels used in most Magnetrons. Early,
experimental designs used directly heated cathodes. Modern, high powered designs use a
rigid, tubular cathode enclosing a heater element.
Naturally excited electrons on the surface of the cathode are drawn oﬀ, into the chamber,
toward the outer walls or anode. As the electrons move out, they pass through a magnetic
ﬁeld that produces a force perpendicular to the direction of motion and direction of the
magnetic ﬁeld. The faster the electrons move, the more sideways force is produced. The
result is that the electrons rotate around the central cathode as they move toward the
outside of the chamber.
As electrons move past the entrances to the resonant cavities a disturbance is made to the
electro magnetic (EM) ﬁeld that is at rest in the cavities. The cavity begins to oscillate.
When another electron moves past the cavities, it also interacts with the internal EM ﬁeld.
The motion of the electron can be slowed or sped up by the cavity ﬁeld. As more electrons
interact with the cavity EM ﬁelds, the internal cavity oscillations increase and the eﬀect on
the passing electrons is more pronounced.
Eventually, bands of electrons rotating together develop within the central chamber. Any
electrons that fall behind a band are given a kick by the resonant cavity ﬁelds. Any elec-
trons going too fast have their excess energy absorbed by the cavities. This is the velocity
modulation eﬀect. The frequency of the resonance and electron interaction is in the order
of GHz. (10ˆ9 cycles per second)
In order to have a signal output from the magnetron, one of the cavities is taped with a
slot or a probe to direct energy out into a waveguide for distribution.
Magnetrons for RADARs are pulsed with short duration and high current. Magnetrons for
microwave ovens are driven with a continuous lower current.
The magnetrons for WWII bombers, operated by the RAF, were sometimes taped into a
shielded box so that the aircrew could heat their in-ﬂight meals, hence the ﬁrst microwave
ovens.
32.5 Cathode Ray Tube
A cathode ray tube or CRT is a specialized vacuum tube in which images are produced when
an electron beam strikes a phosphorescent surface. Television sets, computers, automated
teller machines, video game machines, video cameras, monitors, oscilloscopes and radar
displays all contain cathode-ray tubes. Phosphor screens using multiple beams of electrons
have allowed CRTs to display millions of colors.
The ﬁrst cathode ray tube scanning device was invented by the German scientist Karl
Ferdinand Braun in 1897. Braun introduced a CRT with a ﬂuorescent screen, known as the
cathode ray oscilloscope. The screen would emit a visible light when struck by a beam of
electrons.
245

Vacuum Tubes
32.5.1 TV Tubes
TV tubes are basically cathode ray tubes. An electron beam is produced by an electrically-
heated ﬁlament, and that beam is guided by two magnetic ﬁelds to a particular spot on the
screen. The beam is moved so very quickly, that the eye can see not just one particular
spot, but all the spots on the screen at once, forming a variable picture.
Colours are produced by having 3 or more diﬀerently coloured screen spots activated at
once to a variable degree.
The 2 magnetic ﬁelds are one for the vertical deﬂection, one for the horizontal deﬂection,
and they are provided to the beam by external coils.
32.5.2 Oscilloscope Tubes
Oscilloscope tubes are basically the same as TV tubes, but the beam is guided by two elec-
trostatic ﬁelds provided by internal pieces of metal. It is a necessity because an oscilloscope
uses a very large range of synchronisation frequencies for the deﬂection, when a TV set
uses ﬁxed frequencies, and it would be too diﬃcult to drive large coils on a so large band
of frequency. They are much deeper for the same screen size as a TV tube because the
deﬂection angle is little. A TV tube has a deﬂection angle of 90° for the be

33 Diodes
33.1 Diode
Theoretically, a diode allows current ﬂow in only one direction. An ideal diode acts as a
perfect insulator for currents ﬂowing in one direction and as a perfect conductor for currents
ﬂowing through it in the other direction. The direction in which the diode allows current
to ﬂow is called the forward bias direction and that in which current is resisted is called
reverse bias direction. Diode has a symbol as shown
Figure 153
33.1.1 Construction
The modern semiconductor diode consists of two regions of semiconductor each having
impurities of diﬀerent types such that one side has excess holes (p-region) and the other
has excess electrons (n-region). Such a junction of p and n regions is called a pn junction
diode. The p-region has about twice as much area as the n-region to compensate for the
lesser mobility of holes compared to electrons.

33.2.1 I V Curve
Figure 154
As seen in the graph above the diode actually works in both the forward region and the
backward region. In the forward region the value of I and V are positive and in the backward
region I and V are negative.

Khi V > Vd . Diode conducts current . Current is calculated by I = Io[e( Vd
nVT )t−1 ]
33.2.3 Backward Region
Current and Voltage are Negative
When the value of voltage is more negative than the Peak Inverse Voltage (PIV) Voltage

248

Operation
33.2.4 Ideal Diode
The real diode approaches the ideal diode in the sense that the reverse current is extremely
small (less than 1fA) at least for a signiﬁcant part of the characteristic, and the forward
current is very high (on the order of 1mA). Although a real diode does not have the charac-
teristics as the ideal diode, in theory it is possible to make an ideal diode if the concentrations
of dopants in both the regions are inﬁnite. However, there is no way of actually doing this
and experiments do not agree.
33.2.5 The Shockley equation
The diode reverse (saturation ) current is governed by the doping concentration. The current
ﬂowing through the device varies as the voltage applied across it changes as given by the
Shockley diode equation (not to be confused with Schottky):
ID = IS[exp(VD/nVT )−1]
In the equation above VT is deﬁned as VT = kT/q, where k is Boltzmann’s constant, T is
the temperature in Kelvin, and q is the magnitude of the charge on an electron.
In the forward bias direction, current ﬂows with low voltage. If one draws a characteristic
for this equation, a sharp increase in current can be seen at a particular voltage called the
cut-in voltage or the on-voltage .
In the reverse bias mode, the diode current is approximately −IS. This is called the reverse
saturation current because it looks like the diode is saturated with charge and cannot allow
more current in the reverse bias direction than this.
33.2.6 Break-down
However, a break from the above equation takes place at a point called break-down voltage
. One could think of it as the point where the Shockley equation breaks down and is no
longer valid. There are two reasons for breakdown to occur.
Avalanche Breakdown
This occurs as a result of excess minority carriers in a region. Minority carriers are those
carriers that are in the wrong region. For example, electrons will be minority carriers in
the p-region.
Zener Breakdown
This is basically due to a size diﬀerence or dopant concentration diﬀerence. One of the
regions has a greater region of depletion (Reverse bias voltage induces a depletion region,
which is sparse in a densely doped region and dense in a sparsely doped region. )

Diodes
33.2.7 Summary
So basically, there are three modes in which a diode operates:
Forward
No current ﬂows until a small forward voltage is reached called cut-in voltage.
Reverse
The diode prevents current from ﬂowing in the opposite direction. Current is small, and
voltage can be large (but not exceeding the Zener voltage.)
Breakdown
Once the diode voltage is more negative than the Zener voltage, the diode allows current
to ﬂow in the reverse direction.
When there is no voltage applied, the excess electrons of the N type semiconductor ﬂow
into the holes of the P type semiconductor. This creates a depletion region that acts as a
voltage.
33.3 Diode Variations
Bridge Rectiﬁer:
A diode circuit that ’rectiﬁes’ alternating current (AC) into direct current (DC). The
bridge rectiﬁer is a full-wave rectiﬁer, meaning that both the positive and negative por-
tions of the wave become positive. (In a half-wave rectiﬁer, positive stays positive, and
negative becomes zero.) The bridge rectiﬁer has advantages over other full-wave rectiﬁer
designs, because it reduces peak-inverse voltage (PIV), the largest negative voltage across
a single junction diode. By reducing the PIV, it becomes possible to use diodes with lower
breakdown (Zener) voltages. This allows the use of cheaper diodes to perform the same
function.

34 Transistors
34.1 Transistor
A transistor is a solid state device made by joining three positive-type and negative-type
semiconductors together. In general, all transistors have three pins: base, collector, and
emitter. Transistor is a bi-polar device that is a transistor with two junctions namely BE
and CE DE EE FE. In theory we take a speciﬁed formulae incorporate this with using any
type of meter in ﬁguring the mathematical solution.
Figure 159
34.1.1 Construction
A lightly doped region called base is sandwiched between two regions called the emitter and
collector respectively. The collector handles large quantities of current, hence its dopant
concentration is the highest. The emitter’s dopant concentration is slightly lesser, but its
area is larger to provide for more current than the collector. The collector region should be
heavily doped because electron-hole pairs recombine in that region, while the emitter is not
such a region. We can have two varieties in this kind of transistor.
34.1.2 NPN Transistor
An NPN transistor is made by joining one positive-type semiconductor in between two
negative-type semiconductors. Here a lightly doped p-type semiconductor (semiconductor
with more holes than electrons) is sandwiched between two well-doped n-type regions. It is

like two pn-junctions facing away. An IEEE symbol for the NPN transistor is shown here.
The arrow between the base and emitter is in the same direction as current ﬂowing between
the base-emitter junction. Power dissipated in the transistor is

35 FET
35.1 Field Eﬀect Transistor
The most common transistors today are FETs (Field Eﬀect Transistor). These transistors
are characterized as having a conductance between source and drain dependent on the
voltage applied between the gate and the source terminals. The dependence is linear if the
gate to drain voltage is also high along with the gate to source voltage. It turns into a
square-law relationship if the gate to drain voltage is not enough.
35.2 Current Voltage Characteristics
35.3 Disadvantages
One of the issues that comes up in circuit design is that as chips get smaller the insulator
gets thinner and it starts to look like Swiss cheese. As a result the insulator starts acting
like a conductor. This is known as leakage current. One solution is to replace the insulator
by a material with a higher dielectric coeﬃcent.
Two types: enhancement and depletion. Enhancement is the standard MOSFET, in which
a channel must be induced by applying voltage. Depletion MOSFETs have the channel
implanted, and applying voltage causes the channel to cease being conductive.
FET transistors respond to the diﬀerence in voltage bias between the gate and the source.
MOSFET (Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor FET): standard FET
JFET (Junction Fet): When voltage is applied between the source and drain current ﬂows.
Current only stops ﬂowing when a voltage is applied to the gate.

36 MOSFET
36.1 Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor
CMOS , Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor is not a type of transistor. It is a
logic family, based on MOS transistors.
36.2 Construction & Operation
CMOS is made of two FETs blocking the positive and negative voltages. Since only one
FET can be on at a time, CMOS consumes negligible power during any of the logic states.
But when a transition between states occurs, power is consumed by the device. This power
consumed is of two types.
Short-circuit power
For a very short duration, both transistors are on and a very huge current ﬂows through
the device for that duration.
This current accounts for about 10% of the total power
consumed by the CMOS.
Dynamic power
This is due to charge stored on the parasitic capacitance of the output node of the device.
This parasitic capacitance depends on the wire’s area, and closeness to other layers of metal
in the IC, besides the relative permittivity of the quartz layer separating consecutive metal
layers. It also depends (to a much smaller extent) upon the input capacitance of the next
logic gate. This capacitance delays the rise in the output voltage and hence the rise or fall
in the output of a gate is more like a that in a resistor-capacitor (RC) network. Thus the
dynamic power consumed due to switching action in one gate is given by:
Pd = CV 2

37 Ampliﬁers
37.1 Circuit Models for Ampliﬁers
Ampliﬁer are generally put in four categories
1. voltage ampliﬁer,
2. current ampliﬁer,
3. transresistance ampliﬁer and
4. transconductance ampliﬁer.
These models apply irrespective of the complexity of the internal circuit of the ampliﬁer.
The values of the model parameters can be found either by analyzing the ampliﬁer circuit
or by performing measurements at the ampliﬁer temlinals.
The model for a voltage ampliﬁer is shown in ﬁgure 1. Real ampliﬁers have input and
output resistance. This is reﬂected in the model.

37.2 Gain
Gain is the increase in the strength of a signal and is often expressed in decibel1s (dB). An
increase of 3 dB is about equal to doubling in a linear scale. A gain of more than 1 is called
ampliﬁcation, while a gain of less than 1 is called Attenuation.
Gain is given diﬀerent symbols depending of the type. For No load gains
Voltage gain is Avo,
Current gain Aio,
Transconductance Gm
Transresistance Rm.
Using the model, the gain with a load can be calculated.

37.5 Biased Voltage Class
Transistors may be biased in a variety of classes. A trade oﬀof linearity and power con-
sumption is usually made where a Class A
Class A
The transistor is ”on” all the time. We say 360 degrees of conduction, representing an entire
period of the sine waveform.
Ideally, this class produces very little distortion, however
consumes a lot of power and is also least preferred.
This is the most linear of the classes, meaning the output signal is a truer representation of
what was imputed. Here are the characteristics of the class: 1.The output device (transistor)
conducts electricity for the entire cycle of input signal. In other words, they reproduce the
entire waveform in its entirety. 2.These amps run hot, as the transistors in the power amp
are on and running at full power all the time. 3.There is no condition where the transistor(s)
is/are turned oﬀ. That doesn’t mean that the ampliﬁer is never or can never be turned oﬀ; it
means the transistors doing the work inside the ampliﬁer have a constant ﬂow of electricity
through them. This constant signal is called ”bias”. 4.Class A is the most ineﬃcient of all
power ampliﬁer designs, averaging only around 20%.
Because of the way they are usually designed, Class A ampliﬁers are very ineﬃcient. They
do not need to be built in this way, but for every watt of output power, they can typically
waste 4-5 watts as heat. They are usually very large, heavy and because of the 4-5 watts
of heat energy released per watt of output, they run very hot, needing lots of ventilation
(not at all ideal for a car, and rarely acceptable in a home). This is not due to the ampliﬁer
type, but the fact that even many design engineers do not fully understand how they work
and often copy their designs from previous ones. The upside is that these amps are the
most enjoyed of all ampliﬁers. When properly designed, the Class A amp gives the best
representation of musical detail, with no clipping of the waveform. As a result the sound is
cleaner and more linear; that is, it contains much lower levels of distortion.
They are the most accurate of all amps available, but at greater cost to manufacture, calling
for tight tolerances and additional components for cooling and heat regulation.
Class AB
The transistor is ”on” for slightly more than half the cycle (>180 degrees) of a sine wave and
is the most common conﬁguration used in push-pull audio power ampliﬁers. In push-pull
ampliﬁers, Class AB produces mostly odd order distortion, however it is far more power
eﬃcient than Class A. Odd order distortion is not considered pleasing to hear in audio power
ampliﬁers. This distortion can easily be removed with the addition of a simple negative
feedback loop into the system as shown by the diagram below:
272

Biased Voltage Class
Figure 174
Class AB Amp
This type of ampliﬁer is extremely easy to build and is the industry standard for audio
ampliﬁers.
Issues with this type of ampliﬁer include poor eﬃciency, size and cost. A typical class ab
ampliﬁer will have a power eﬃciency of 40-80%. Because of this they require large heat
sinks to cool the transistors, this also increases the cost of the ampliﬁer due to the extra
material to create these heat sinks.
This is the compromise of the bunch. Class AB operation has some of the best advantages
of both Class A and Class B built-in. Its main beneﬁts are sound quality comparable to
that of Class A and eﬃciency similar to that of Class B. Most modern amp designs employ
this topology.
Its main characteristics are: In fact, many Class AB amps operate in Class A at lower
output levels, again giving the best of both worlds The output bias is set so that current
ﬂows in a speciﬁc output device for more than a half the signal cycle but less than the
entire cycle. There is enough current ﬂowing through each device to keep it operating so
they respond instantly to input voltage demands. In the push-pull output stage, there is
some overlap as each output device assists the other during the short transition, or crossover
period from the positive to the negative half of the signal.
There are many implementations of the Class AB design. A beneﬁt is that the inherent non-
linearity of Class B designs is almost totally eliminated, while avoiding the heat-generating
and wasteful ineﬃciencies of the Class A design. And as stated before, at some output
levels, Class AB amps operate in Class A. It is this combination of good eﬃciency (around
50) with excellent linearity that makes class AB the most popular audio ampliﬁer design.
There are quite a few excellent Class AB amps available. This is the design I recommended
for most general-use applications in home and car. Usually, parts choice rivals that of Class
A amps, and dollar for dollar these are some of the best values in stereo ampliﬁcation.
There can be some variation in design principle, but generally these are well-designed amps
since their function is very well-understood by audio designers.
Class B
The transistor is ”on” for only half the cycle (exactly 180 degrees) of a sine wave and is
also very typically used in push-pull ampliﬁer circuits. Ideally this class produces mostly
odd order distortion. In audio applications it is believed that odd order distortion is not
273

Ampliﬁers
pleasing to hear. It is diﬃcult to build a low distortion Class B ampliﬁer and hence Class
AB is almost universal.
In this amp, the positive and negative halves of the signal are dealt with by diﬀerent parts
of the circuit. The output devices continually switch on and oﬀ. Class B operation has
the following characteristics: The input signal has to be a lot larger in order to drive the
transistor appropriately. This is almost the opposite of Class A operation There have to
be at least two output devices with this type of amp.
This output stage employs two
output devices so that each side ampliﬁes each half of the waveform. [li Either both output
devices are never allowed to be on at the same time, or the bias (remember, that trickle of
electricity?) for each device is set so that current ﬂow in one output device is zero when not
presented with an input signal. Each output device is on for exactly one half of a complete
signal cycle.
These amps run cooler than Class A amps, but the sound quality is not as pure, as there
is a lot of ”crossover” distortion, as one output device turns oﬀand the other turns on over
each signal cycle.
This type of ampliﬁer design, or topology, gives us the term ”push-pull,” as this describes
the tandem of output devices that deliver the audio signal to your speakers: one device
pushes the signal, the other pulls the signal. They can be less expensive, because one can
use two cheap output devices instead of one high-quality one in the design.
As I mentioned before, the input signal has to be lot larger, meaning that from the ampliﬁer
input, it needs to be ”stepped up” in a gain stage, so that the signal will allow the output
transistors to operate more eﬃciently within their designed speciﬁcations. This means more
circuitry in the path of your signal, degrading sound even before it gets to the output stage
Class C
The transistor is ”on” less than half the cycle of a sine wave. We say <180 of conduction.
This class produces both even and odd order distortion, however is very eﬃcient.
Class D
The class D amp has been developed after the short-comings of past generations, including
classes A, B, AB, and C. Many people mistake the D as standing for digital. Although it
is a “switching” amp, meaning it turns “on” and “oﬀ” at a speciﬁc frequency, it is a wrong
assumption. D was simply the next letter in the alphabet. Consuming the least power
out of its previous generations, the class D amps are generally smaller, making them ideal
for mobile devices. It is because of their power eﬃciency, small size, and cheaper costs
that the class D amps are quickly becoming the new industry standard for audio electronic.
Companies such as Advanced Analog2, Texas Instruments3 as well as other companies have
released 50W stereo class d ampliﬁers that are the size of a penny and did not require any
sort of heat sinking, something that was not possible with other types of ampliﬁers.

The basic design includes two MOSFET transistors4 in series, one pFET and one nFET
being driven by a pulse width modulated (PWM) signal.
Because of the properties of
MOSFET transistors they are either fully on or fully oﬀ. When the transistor is oﬀand the
current is zero (so the amount of power wasted heating up the transistor is zero), or the
transistor is fully on and the voltage across it is very close to zero (so the amount of power
wasted heating up the transistor is again, very close to zero).
Because an analog signal needs to be transformed into a PWM signal a certain amount
of distortion can occur, but the amount of distortion can be minimized. Because a PWM
signal is very much like a digital signal, the sampling theorem5 states that if the sampling
frequency is more than half the maximum frequency of the source it can be reproduced
exactly. For audio signals the maximum frequency heard by humans is roughly 20kHz, so
a PWM generator would only need to provide a minimum switching frequency of 40kHz.
Because of the availability of faster components many class d ampliﬁer designers will use
switching frequencies closer to 400kHz to further reduce the distortion.
Issues of concern with a class d ampliﬁer include electromagnetic emissions. Due to the
presence of a medium frequency signal6 in the circuit, steps must be taken to reduce the
emission of these signals that could interfere with other electronic devices.
Class E
(oops, class D again?) Switching ampliﬁer These ampliﬁers are erroneously called ”digital”
ampliﬁers by the press and many audio ”experts.” Here’s the skinny on Class D: While some
Class D amps do run in true digital mode, using coherent binary data, most do not. They are
better termed ”switching” ampliﬁers, because here the output devices are rapidly switched
on and oﬀat least twice for each cycle. Depending on their switching frequency, they may
be ”switched on” or ”oﬀ” millions of times a second. Class D operation is theoretically 100%
eﬃcient, but in practice, they are closer to 80-90% eﬃciency. This eﬃciency gain is at the
cost of high-ﬁdelity.

Ampliﬁers
Think of Class D amps as being similar to a switchable power supply, but with audio signals
controlling, or modulating, the switching action. To do this, you use a technology called
Pulse Width Modulation (or PWM, a technology found in many CD players).
According to experts, audio signals can be used to modulate a PWM system to create a high
power audio ampliﬁer at fairly low voltages using very small components. Class D audio
uses a ﬁxed, high frequency signal having pulses that vary in width based on input signal
amplitude. So, for example, a deep bass note creates a large pulse in the carrier signal.
This can be translated into a musical signal by the on/oﬀnature of the output devices.
Class D ampliﬁers are generally used for non-high-ﬁdelity, or subwoofer applications.
There is a ﬁfth (and, nominally, a sixth) class of ampliﬁer, but they are rarely seen in
practice in the consumer market. One is the Class G and the other Class H. These are
similar in design to Class AB topologies, but both feature two power supplies that switch
on or oﬀ, depending on the musical signal imputed. Using two power supplies improves
eﬃciency enough to allow signiﬁcantly more power for a given size and weight. Class G
is becoming common for pro audio designs. Class H amps are designed to use the same
topology as Class G, but it provides just enough voltage for optimum operation of the
output devices. Again, its an attempt to increase eﬃciency, but at the expense of ﬁdelity
ultimately.

39 Analog multipliers
39.1 Analog multipliers
An analog multiplier is a circuit with an output that is proportional to the product of two
inputs:
vout = Kv1 ·v2
where K is a constant value whose dimension is the inverse of a voltage. In general we
might expect that the two inputs can be both positive or negative, and so can be the
output. Anyway, most of the implementations work only if both inputs are strictly positive:
this is not such a limit because we can shift the input and the output in order to have a
core working only with positive signals but external interfaces working with any polarity
(within certain limits according to the particular conﬁguration).
Two possible implementations will be shown. Both will be using operational ampliﬁers,
but the ﬁrst one will use diodes to get the needed relationships, the second one MOSFET
transistors.
39.2 Diode Implementations
As known, using operational ampliﬁers and diodes it’s quite easy to obtain the logarithm
and the exponential of a certain input. Remembering the property of logarithms:
log(a·b) = loga+logb
we can multiply two signals ﬁrst calculating their logarithm, then summing them and ﬁnally
calculating the exponential of such a sum. From the point of view of mathematics, such
an approach works as long as the two inputs are positive, because the logarithm of a
negative number does not exist (in the real domain). We’ll see that this limit is valid for
the actual circuit as well, even if the reason will be more ”physical”. The block diagram of
this implementation is the following:
281

Analog multipliers
Figure 177
If we simply append the circuits for logarithm, sum and exponential we get the following
conﬁguration:
Figure 178
for a quick overview on the behavior of the circuit, we’ll assume that all the resistors R have
the same value. It is obviously possible to use diﬀerent values to get diﬀerent results, but
we will not consider it here. Let us use the following notation for the relationship between
current and voltage on a diode:
i = Is
(
e
v
VT −1
)
where VT ≃0.6V is the threshold voltage and Is is the current ﬂowing through the diode if
it’s inverse-polarized. If we analyze the circuit without introducing any approximation we
get:
va = −
[
−VT ln
( v1
RIs
+1
)
−VT ln
( v2
RIs
+1
)]
= VT ln
[( v1
RIs
+1
)( v2
RIs
+1
)]
so the ﬁnal output is:
282

Diode Implementations
vb = −RIs
(
e
va
VT −1
)
= −v1 ·v2
RIs
−(v1 +v2)
as it is clear, in the output there is the multiplication we were looking for, but there is
another term we don’t want. It can’t be simply considered an error because it might be as
great as the multiplication element, so it has to be removed. Anyway this is an easy task,
since it is necessary only to add another stage to sum exactly v1 + v2, so we will have no
error. The complete multiplier circuit is the following:
Figure 179
where the output voltage is given by:
vout = −
(
−v1 ·v2
RIs
−(v1 +v2)+(v1 +v2)
)
= v1 ·v2
RIs
that’s exactly what we wanted. The circuit works as long as the following relationship is
veriﬁed:
v1,v2 > −RIs
so the inputs can be zero or sightly negative but, since RIs will be a small voltage, we are
allowed to rewrite the relation simply as v1,v2 ≥0. From the mathematical point of view
this is due to the fact that we can’t calculate the logarithm of a negative number, from
a physical point of view the limit is due to the fact that we can obtain only very small
currents (almost zero) inverse-polarizing the diodes.
In practical applications, the diodes are replaced with BJTs connected so to work like a
diode.
283

Analog multipliers
39.3 MOS implementation
Figure 180
Since it is possible to use a MOSFET transistor as a voltage controlled resistor, we can use
this feature to create an analog multiplier. Let us refer to picture on the right. With the
letter we indicate the diﬀerent pins: D rain, S ource and G ate. MOS are symmetrical
devices, so we could replace the drain with the source without aﬀecting the behavior of the
device. Anyway we’ll call source the lowest voltage pin and drain the point with the highest
voltage. When the voltage between gate and source is less than the voltage between drain
and source, i.e. VGS < VDS, the relationship between current and voltage is the following:
IDS = K[2(VGS −VT )VDS −V 2
DS] ≃2K(VGS −VT )VDS;
VGS < VDS
assuming we can always use this relationship, the analog multiplier conﬁguration is the
following:
284

MOS implementation
Figure 181
where source and drain of both devices are pointed out. If v2 and Vref are positive, then
the sources will remain there because that points are virtually connected to ground by the
operational ampliﬁers. The current ﬂowing through R1 is deﬁned: one side of the resistor
has the voltage v1, the other one is grounded. That same current will ﬂow through the
MOS M1, thus deﬁning the voltage VG. The current is given by:
v1
R1
= −IDS1 = −2K(VGS1 −VT1)VDS1
but VGS1 = VG and VDS1 = Vref. replacing and calculating we get:
VG = VT1 −
v1
2KR1Vref
considering the other MOS M2 we have:
IDS2 = 2K(VGS2 −VT2)VDS2
where VGS2 = VG and VDS2 = v2. Replacing we get:
IDS2 = −v1v2
R1Vref
from which we ﬁnally get the output voltage:
285

Analog multipliers
vout = R2

Vref,v1,v2 > 0
and this is what we wanted. The diﬀerence between the previous conﬁgurations are:
• the MOS implementation is simpler and requires fewer devices
• in the calculations for the diode conﬁguration we did not introduce any approximation,
while the MOS conﬁguration we did.
In other words, the diode implementation is more complicated but it works ﬁne for a wider
range on inputs.

40 Digital Circuits
40.1 Overview
In Digital circuits there are two parts one is Digital the other is circuits.
Digital
means a description of system which operates on digits or numbers.
The numbers that a digital system operates upon are binary numbers.One binary digit
just have two values ’0’ and ’1’. This ’0’ or ’1’ are analogous to ’oﬀ’ and ’on’, ’false’ and
’true’, etc. The Binary digIT is known as ’bit’. In day to day activities we use numbers
and every digit of that number can be between 0 - 9. We use combination of such digital
to for numbers bigger than 9. Similarly we can use combination of bits, i.e. combination
of 1 & 0, to form bigger binary numbers.
Circuit can be any electric circuit and Digital circuit is a circuit which is designed to
implement the description of digital circuit.
Digital circuits are developed using a special type of mathematics called ’Boolean Algebra’.
287


41 Boolean Algebra
41.1 Boolean Algebra
Boolean Algebra was created by George Boole (1815 - 1864) in his paper An Investigation
of the Laws of Thought, on Which Are Founded the Mathematical Theories of Logic and
Probabilities , published in 1854. It had few applications at the time, but eventually scien-
tists and engineers realized that his system could be used to create eﬃcient computer logic.
The Boolean system has two states: True (T) or False (F). This can be represented in
several diﬀerent ways as on or oﬀ, one or zero, yes or no, etc. These states are manipulated
by three fundamental operations called logical operators : AND , OR and NOT . These
operators take certain inputs and produce an output based on a predetermined table of
results. For example, the AND operator takes two (or more) inputs and returns an ’on’
result only when both (or all) inputs are ’on’.
• In these tables T means ”True”, or ”Yes”, or 1 (in electronics), and
• F means ”False”, or ”No” or 0 (in electronics).
• For example, the 1st line of the AND table says that if A is F and B is F then the result
also is F. This is also said often as If A is 0 and B is also 0, then A AND B = 0 times 0
= 0
• Also at the bottom of the AND table 1 times 1 is 1.
• Looking at the OR table, use plus instead of times: 0 plus 0 is 0, where again 0 is F and
1 is T. Only 0 and 1 exist, therefore if the result of the addition is more than 1, then
change it to 1.

Boolean Algebra
These simple operators are good because they allow us to create very simple logic circuits:
if user put in a quarter AND the Coke button is pressed, drop a Coke
There are ways, however, to combine these expressions to make much more complex but
useful digital circuits. By using multiple operators on the same inputs, it is possible to
create much more complex outputs. An expression like: A and B or C would have a truth
table of the following:
A and B or C

This truth table follows the rules If A and B are true, or C is true, then X is true
Exercise: Go through each case in the table and check it using the above statement.
41.1.1 Formal Mathematical Operators
AND is represented by ∧or · that is A AND B would be A∧B or A·B .
OR is represented by ∨or + that is A OR B would be A∨B and A+B .
NOT is represented by ¬ or¯that is NOT A is ¬A or ¯A.
If these three operators are combined then the NOR and NAND can be created. So A NOR
B is ¬(A∨B) or A+B. NAND is ¬(A∧B) or A·B. Other notations are valid as well, and
many diﬀerent combinations of them arise in mathematics and engineering. No universal
standard has been agreed upon. However, most sources will make explicit the particular
notation used.
41.1.2 Boolean Algebra Laws
Boolean Algebra, like regular algebra, has certain rules.
These rules are Associativity,
Distributivity, Commutativity and De Morgan’s Laws. Associativity, Commutativity and
Distributivity only apply to the AND and OR operators. Some of these laws may seem
trivial in normal Algebra but in other algebras they are not.
291

Boolean Algebra
Associativity
Associativity is the property of algebra that the order of evaluation of the terms is imma-
terial.
•
A∨(B ∨C) = (A∨B)∨C
A∧(B ∧C) = (A∧B)∧C
Or
A+(B +C) = (A+B)+C
A.(B.C) = (A·B)·C
Wikipedia:Associativity1
Distributivity
Distibutivity is the property that an operator can be applied to the terms within the brack-
ets.
A∧(B ∨C) = (A∧B)∨(A∧C)
Or
A.(B +C) = (A·B)+(A·C)
Wikipedia:Distributivity2
Commutativity
Commutativity is the property that order of application of an operator is immaterial.
A∧B = B ∧A
A∨B = B ∨A
Or

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributivity
292

Boolean Algebra
A·B = B ·A
A+B = B +A
Wikipedia:Commutativity3
De Morgan’s Law
De Morgan’s Law is a consequence of the fact that the not or negation operator is not
distributive.
¬(P ∧Q) = (¬P)∨(¬Q)
¬(P ∨Q) = (¬P)∧(¬Q)
Or
P ·Q = ¯P + ¯Q
P +Q = ¯P · ¯Q
Notes
It is important to note that
A∧B ∨C ̸= A∧(B ∨C)
Or
A·B +C ̸= A·(B +C)
This can be seen as either AND having a higher precedence or the fact that Associativity
does not hold between AND and OR or that it is an invalid application of distributivity.
Another way of looking at this is the possible application of our understanding of normal
algebra rules using the second notation.
Where clearly the analogy between OR being
addition and AND being multiplication is made. We would never make this error if this
were high school algebra.

Boolean Algebra
Rules
All of these Laws Result in a number of rules used for the reduction of Boolean Algebra.
1. A∧A = A
2. A∨A = A
3. A∧1 = A
4. A∨1 = 1
5. A∧0 = 0
6. A∨0 = A
7. A∧¬A = 0
8. A∨¬A = 1
9. ¬(¬A) = A
10. A∨¬A∧B = A∨B
11. ¬A∨A∧B = ¬A∨B
Or
1. A·A = A
2. A+A = A
3. A·1 = A
4. A+1 = 1
5. A·0 = 0
6. A+0 = A
7. A· ¯A = 0
8. A+ ¯A = 1
9. ¯A = A
10. A+ ¯A·B = A+B
11. ¯A+A·B = ¯A+B
41.1.3 Examples
Simplify the following Expressions.
1. B ∧A∧¬A
2. A∧¬B ∨A∧B
Or
1. B ·A· ¯A
2. A· ¯B +A·B
For number 1 using rule 7. We get.
B ∧0 = 0
Or
B ·0 = 0
294

Boolean Algebra
Which happens to be rule 5 so the answer is zero. In number 2 we can take out A. Given
A∧(¬B ∨B)
Or
A·( ¯B +B)
The Expression within brackets is rule 8. So the answer is A.

42 TTL
----
42.1 Introduction
TTL stands for Transistor-Transistor Logic . It is the system based on combining tran-
sistors in such a way that they can be used for logic gates. Transistors have the capability
of becoming parts of very complex devices when combined. An average microprocessor uses
upwards of 40 million transistors. Transistors in microprocessors, however, are microscopic
as opposed to the discrete components used in consumer electronics and circuitboards.
42.2 The NOT Gate
The NOT gate works by inverting the input. The TTL version of the NOT gate contains
one transistor, seen below:
297

TTL
Figure 182
When the input, A, is high (+5V), the base of the transistor is saturated, allowing current
to ﬂow from the collector of the transistor to the emitter. Since this is possible, the current
does not take the higher resistance path through the output (assuming it has a resistive load
attached to it such as an LED). When the input is low (0V), the current has no choice but
to ﬂow out of the inverted A output (the A with the line overtop to indicate it is negated).
The two resistors in the circuit are for limiting current as to not destroy the transistor, and
sometimes may not even be required depending on the transistor.
(note: this image is considered *Resistor-Transistor Logic* The proper TTL representation
is below.)
298

The NOT Gate
Figure 183
TTL Inverter (NOT Gate)
To further explain, the NOT gate has been integrated into a circuit by connecting it to a
current probe and a battery. When the switch for the input of the not gate is not hit, the
current ﬂows in the path indicated by the red diagram below. The current ﬂows through
the resistor because the transistor does not conduct when the base is not saturated.:
299

TTL
Figure 184
However, when the switch is hit, making the input high , the circuit is shorted and
current ﬂows directly from one terminal of the battery through the transistor, to the other
terminal. This is illustrated further in the next ﬁgure:
Figure 185
300

The NOT Gate
In real logic gates, several more transistors are used in order to stabilize the input and out-
put. Although this may seem like a large hike in complexity and price, creating transistors
in ICs is a lot cheaper and easier to do, as they do not have to even have a shell or casing,
and are a lot smaller.
301


43 CMOS
43.1 CMOS
CMOS stands for C omplementary M etal-O xide-S emiconductor.
Metal-Oxide-
Semiconductor refers to the construction method of the component Field-Eﬀect Transistors
(MOSFETs), and Complementary means that CMOS uses both n-type (nMOS) and p-type
(pMOS) transistors. Older designs had used only n-type transistors, and are referred to as
NMOS logic.
n-type MOSFETs are active (conductive) when their input voltage is high, while p-type
MOSFETs are active when their input voltage is low.
All CMOS gates are arranged in two parts: the pull-up network (PUN), built from p-type
transistors and connect to source; and the pull-down network (PDN), built from n-type
transistors and connected to ground (also called drain). The two parts are logical duals of
each other, so that if the PUN is active, then the PDN is inactive, and vice-versa. In this
way there can never be a direct path between source and ground (in any steady state).
The biggest advantage of CMOS over NMOS is that CMOS has a rapid change from both
hi-to-low and from low-to-hi. NMOS transitions only slowly from low-to-hi (because it uses
a resistor in place of a PUN), and since overall circuit speed must take into account the
worst case, NMOS circuits must be much slower.

43.2.1 NOT
The simplest CMOS circuit: the NOT gate, or inverter. Although uncomplicated, it demon-
strates the basic structure of a CMOS gate; a series of inputs (in this case, one) which are
connected to the transistors, the PUN (consisting of a single p-type transistor) connected
to source, the PDN (consisting of a single n-type transistor) connected to ground, and the
output which is fed from both the PUN and PDN.
When the input voltage is high, the p-type transistor will be inactive, and the n-type
transistor will be active. This creates a connection between ground and the gate output,
305

CMOS
pulling the gate’s output to low. Conversely, when the input voltage is low, the p-type
transistor will be active instead, creating a connection between the output and source,
pulling the gate’s output to high.

43.2.2 NAND
The PUN for NAND consists of a pair of p-type transistors in parallel, one with the A input
feeding it and one with the B input feeding it. Therefore the PUN is active, and the output
of the gate is high, as long as either of these inputs is low.
The PDN for NAND consists of a pair of n-type transistors in series, also each fed by one
of the two inputs. Therefore the PDN is active, and the output of the gate is low, only if
both of the inputs are high.it uses the logic a bar(OR)b bar

43.2.6 XNOR
To build an XNOR gate, ﬁrst we will need easy access to the inverted inputs.
This is
accomplished with a pair of NOT gates. The original inputs are A and B, and their inverted
forms we will call NOT-A and NOT-B. Both the PUN and PDN are made of four of the
appropriate type of transistor, in two parallel sets, of series of two transistors each. In the
PUN there is one series fed by A and B and the other is fed by NOT-A and NOT-B; in the
PDN one series is fed by A and NOT-B and the other is fed by NOT-A and B.
All told, this takes 12 transistors (4 in the PUN, 4 in the PDN, and 2 for each inverter).
There are more eﬃcient designs for the XNOR circuit, but they require a more detailed
analysis than we will go into here. Instead of serving as an example of an actual XNOR
design, this section should instead help to suggest the methods one could use to generate a
CMOS circuit for any arbitrary boolean function.

----
45.1 Transistor
A transistor is a solid state device made by joining three positive-type and negative-type
semiconductors together. In general, all transistors have three pins: base, collector, and
emitter. Transistor is a bi-polar device that is a transistor with two junctions namely BE
and CE DE EE FE. In theory we take a speciﬁed formulae incorporate this with using any
type of meter in ﬁguring the mathematical solution.
Figure 189
45.1.1 Construction
A lightly doped region called base is sandwiched between two regions called the emitter and
collector respectively. The collector handles large quantities of current, hence its dopant
concentration is the highest. The emitter’s dopant concentration is slightly lesser, but its
area is larger to provide for more current than the collector. The collector region should be
heavily doped because electron-hole pairs recombine in that region, while the emitter is not
such a region. We can have two varieties in this kind of transistor.
311

Transistors
45.1.2 NPN Transistor
An NPN transistor is made by joining one positive-type semiconductor in between two
negative-type semiconductors. Here a lightly doped p-type semiconductor (semiconductor
with more holes than electrons) is sandwiched between two well-doped n-type regions. It is
like two pn-junctions facing away. An IEEE symbol for the NPN transistor is shown here.
The arrow between the base and emitter is in the same direction as current ﬂowing between
the base-emitter junction. Power dissipated in the transistor is
P = VCEIC, where VCE is the voltage between the collector and the emitter and IC is the
collector current.

A transistor conducts current when the base voltage is greater than BE junction’s voltage.
Current is non zero. This corresponds to a closed switch. A transistor does not conduct
current when the base voltage is less than BE junction’s voltage. Current is zero. This
correspond to an open switch.

There are 5 basic gates used in performing logic operations in Digital Electronic namely

48 Flip Flops
48.1 Flip Flop
A ﬂip-ﬂop is a device very like a latch1 in that it is a bistable multivibrator, having two
states and a feedback path that allows it to store a bit of information.
The diﬀerence
between a latch and a ﬂip-ﬂop is that a latch is asynchronous, and the outputs can change
as soon as the inputs do (or at least after a small propagation delay). A ﬂip-ﬂop, on the
other hand, is edge-triggered and only changes state when a control signal goes from high
to low or low to high. This distinction is relatively recent and is not formal, with many
authorities still referring to ﬂip-ﬂops as latches and vice versa, but it is a helpful distinction
to make for the sake of clarity.
There are several diﬀerent types of ﬂip-ﬂop each with its own uses and peculiarities. The
four main types of ﬂip-ﬂop are : SR, JK, D, and T.
48.1.1 RS Flip Flop
An SR latch (Set/Reset) is an asynchronous device: it works independently of control
signals and relies only on the state of the S and R inputs. In the image we can see that
an SR ﬂip-ﬂop can be created with two NOR gates that have a cross-feedback loop. SR
latches can also be made from NAND gates, but the inputs are swapped and negated. In
this case, it is sometimes called an
SR
+1pt
latch .
An SR (Set/Reset) ﬂip-ﬂop is perhaps the simplest ﬂip-ﬂop, and is very similar to the SR
latch2, other than for the fact that it only transitions on clock edges. While as theoretically
valid as any ﬂip-ﬂop, synchronous edge-triggered SR ﬂip-ﬂops are extremely uncommon
because they retain the illegal state when both S and R are asserted.
Generally when
people refer to SR ﬂip-ﬂops, they mean SR latches.

When a high is applied to the Set line of an SR latch, the Q output goes high (and
Q
+1pt
low).
The feedback mechanism, however, means that the Q output will remain
high, even when the S input goes low again. This is how the latch serves as a memory
device.
Conversely, a high input on the Reset line will drive the Q output low (and
Q
+1pt high), eﬀectively resetting the latch’s ”memory”.
When both inputs are low, the
latch ”latches” – it remains in its previously set or reset state.
329

Flip Flops
When both inputs are high at once, however, there is a problem: it is being told to sim-
ulataneosuly produce a high Q and a low Q . This produces a ”race condition” within the
cirucit - whichever ﬂip ﬂop succeeds in changing ﬁrst will feedback to the other and assert
itself. Ideally, both gates are identical and this is ”metastable”, and the device will be in
an undeﬁned state for an indeﬁnite period. In real life, due to manufacturing methods,
one gate will always win, but it’s impossible to tell which it will be for a particular device
from an assembly line. The state of S = R = 1 is therefore ”illegal” and should never be
entered.
When the device is powered up, a similar condition occurs, because both outputs, Q and
Q
+1pt , are low. Again, the device will quickly exit the metastable state due to diﬀerences
between the two gates, but it’s impossible to predict which of Q and
Q+1pt will end up
high. To avoid spurious actions, you should always set SR ﬂip-ﬂops to a known initial state
before using them - you must not assume that they will initialise to a low state.

48.2 Gated Flip Flop
48.2.1 Gated SR latch
In some situations it may be desirable to dictate when the latch can and cannot latch. The
gated SR latch is a simple extension of the SR latch which provides an Enable line which
must be driven high before data can be latched. Even though a control line is now required,
the SR latch is not synchronous, because the inputs can change the output even in the
middle of an enable pulse.
When the Enable input is low, then the outputs from the AND gates must also be low, thus
the Q and
Q+1pt outputs remain latched to the previous data. Only when the enable
input is high can the state of the latch change, as shown in the truth table. When the
enable line is asserted, a gated SR latch is identical in operation to an SR latch.
The Enable line is sometimes a clock signal, but is usually a read or write strobe3.

48.2.2 Gated D latch
The D latch (D for ”data”) or transparent latch is a simple extension of the gated SR
latch that removes the possibility of invalid input states.
Since the gated SR latch allows us to latch the output without using the S or R inputs, we
can remove one of the inputs by driving both the Set and Reset inputs with a complementary
driver: we remove one input and automatically make it the inverse of the remaining input.
The D latch outputs the D input whenever the Enable line is high, otherwise the output
is whatever the D input was when the Enable input was last high. This is why it is also
known as a transparent latch - when Enable is asserted, the latch is said to be ”transparent”
- it signals propagate directly through it as if it isn’t there.

D latches are often used in I/O ports of integrated circuits and are available as discrete
devices, often multiply packaged. An example is the 74HC75, part of the 7400 series of ICs,
containing four separate D latches.
48.3 Clock - Controlled Flip Flops
48.3.1 D ﬂip-ﬂop
The D ﬂip-ﬂop is the edge-triggered variant of the transparent latch. On the rising (usually,
although negative edge triggering is just as possible) edge of the clock, the output is given
334

Clock - Controlled Flip Flops
the value of the D input at that moment . The output can only change at the clock edge,
and if the input changes at other times, the output will be unaﬀected.
D ﬂip-ﬂops are by far the most common type of ﬂip-ﬂops and some devices (for example
some FPGAs) are made entirely from D ﬂip-ﬂops. They are also commonly used for shift-
registers and input synchronisation.

48.3.2 JK Flip-ﬂop
The JK ﬂip-ﬂop is a simple enhancement of the SR ﬂip-ﬂop where the state J=K=1 is
not forbidden. It works just like a SR FF where J is serving as set input and K serving
as reset. The only diﬀerence is that for the formerly “forbidden” combination J=K=1 this
ﬂip-ﬂop now performs an action: it inverts its state. As the behavior of the JK ﬂip-ﬂop is
completely predictable under all conditions, this is the preferred type of ﬂip-ﬂop for most
logic circuit designs. But there is still a problem i.e. both the outputs are same when one
tests the circuit practically. This is because of the internal toggling on every propagation
elapse completion. The main remeady is going for master-slave jk ﬂip-ﬂop,this ﬀoverrides
the self(internal) recurring toggling through the pulsed clocking feature incorporated.

48.3.3 T ﬂip-ﬂops
A T ﬂip-ﬂop is a device which swaps or ”toggles” state every time it is triggered if the T
input is asserted, otherwise it holds the current output. This behavior is described by the
characteristic equation:
Qnext = T ⊕Q = TQ+TQ
and can be described either of the following tables:

When T is held high, the toggle ﬂip-ﬂop divides the clock frequency by two; that is, if clock
frequency is 4 MHz, the output frequency obtained from the ﬂip-ﬂop will be 2 MHz. This
’divide-by’ feature has application in various types of digital counters4. A T ﬂip-ﬂop can
also be built using a JK ﬂip-ﬂop (J & K pins are connected together and act as T) or D
ﬂip-ﬂop (T input and Q prev are connected to the D input through an XOR gate).

49 Counters
49.1 Overview
A counter is a device that generates some patterned binary value depending on a clock or
some other pulsed input. There are three simple types of counters ripple and synchronous.[[
49.2 Types of Counters
49.2.1 Ring Counters
If the output of a shift register is fed back to the input.
a ring counter results.
The
data pattern contained within the shift register will recirculate as long as clock pulses are
applied. For example, the data pattern will repeat every four clock pulses in the ﬁgure below.
However, we must load a data pattern. All 0’s or all 1’s doesn’t count. Is a continuous logic
level from such a condition useful?
We make provisions for loading data into the parallel-in/ serial-out shift register conﬁgured
as a ring counter below. Any random pattern may be loaded. The most generally useful
pattern is a single 1.
Loading binary 1000 into the ring counter, above, prior to shifting yields a viewable pattern.
The data pattern for a single stage repeats every four clock pulses in our 4-stage example.
The waveforms for all four stages look the same, except for the one clock time delay from
one stage to the next. See ﬁgure below.
The circuit above is a divide by 4 counter. Comparing the clock input to any one of the
outputs, shows a frequency ratio of 4:1. How may stages would we need for a divide by 10
ring counter? Ten stages would recirculate the 1 every 10 clock pulses.
An alternate method of initializing the ring counter to 1000 is shown above. The shift
waveforms are identical to those above, repeating every fourth clock pulse. The requirement
for initialization is a disadvantage of the ring counter over a conventional counter. At a
minimum, it must be initialized at power-up since there is no way to predict what state
ﬂip-ﬂops will power up in. In theory, initialization should never be required again. In actual
practice, the ﬂip-ﬂops could eventually be corrupted by noise, destroying the data pattern.
A ”self correcting” counter, like a conventional synchronous binary counter would be more
reliable.
The above binary synchronous counter needs only two stages, but requires decoder gates.
The ring counter had more stages, but was self decoding, saving the decode gates above.
Another disadvantage of the ring counter is that it is not ”self starting”. If we need the
343

Counters
decoded outputs, the ring counter looks attractive, in particular, if most of the logic is in a
single shift register package. If not, the conventional binary counter is less complex without
the decoder.
The waveforms decoded from the synchronous binary counter are identical to the previous
ring counter waveforms. The counter sequence is (QA QB) = (00 01 10 11).
49.2.2 Ripple Counters
Ripple counters are the simplest type of counters. They are nothing more than toggle ﬂip
ﬂops connected in a chain to divide each others output frequency by two. The result is a
binary count. They are called ripple counters because the new count ripples through them.
The major disadvantage of ripple counters is that because of new count ”rippling” through
the ﬂip ﬂops all the bits of the count arrive at diﬀerent times.
49.2.3 Synchronous Counters
Synchronous counters are simple state machines made out of ﬂip ﬂops and logic gates. They
have two parts, a register made out of ﬂip ﬂops and a decoder made out of logic gates. A
register is a simple group of ﬂip ﬂops that are all clocked at the same time. In this way
they can hold the counters output value until the next clock cycle. The decoder, decodes
the current count and generates the correct value for the next count to the ﬂop ﬂops. For
example in a simple up counter the decoder would always output the current count plus one.
The major advantage of Synchronous Counters is that all the bits of their output change
at the same time.

Schematic symbol for a 1-bit
full adder
Note that the ﬁnal OR gate before the carry-out output may be replaced by an XOR gate
without altering the resulting logic. This is because the only diﬀerence between OR and
XOR gates occurs when both inputs are 1; for the adder shown here, this is never possible.
Using only two types of gates is convenient if one desires to implement the adder directly
using common IC chips.
A full adder can be constructed from two half adders by connecting A and B to the input of
one half adder, connecting the sum from that to an input to the second adder, connecting
Ci to the other input and OR the two carry outputs. Equivalently, S could be made the
347

Adders
three-bit XOR of A , B , and Ci , and Co could be made the three-bit majority function1
of A , B , and Ci .
50.3 Multiple-bit adders
50.3.1 Ripple carry adder
It is possible to create a logical circuit using multiple full adders to add N -bit numbers.
Each full adder inputs a Cin , which is the Cout of the previous adder. This kind of adder
is a ripple carry adder , since each carry bit ”ripples” to the next full adder. Note that the
ﬁrst (and only the ﬁrst) full adder may be replaced by a half adder.
The layout of ripple carry adder is simple, which allows for fast design time; however, the
ripple carry adder is relatively slow, since each full adder must wait for the carry bit to
be calculated from the previous full adder. The gate delay2 can easily be calculated by
inspection of the full adder circuit. Each full adder requires three levels of logic. In a 32-bit
[ripple carry] adder, there 32 full adders,so the critical path (worst case) delay is 32∗3 = 96
gate delays.
50.3.2 Carry look-ahead adders
To reduce the computation time, engineers devised faster ways to add two binary numbers
by using carry lookahead adder3s. They work by creating two signals (P and G ) for each
bit position, based on whether a carry is propagated through from a less signiﬁcant bit
position (at least one input is a ’1’), a carry is generated in that bit position (both inputs
are ’1’), or if a carry is killed in that bit position (both inputs are ’0’). In most cases,
P is simply the sum output of a half-adder and G is the carry output of the same adder.
After P and G are generated the carries for every bit position are created. Some advanced
carry look ahead architectures are the Manchester carry chain4, Brent-Kung adder5, and
the Kogge-Stone adder6.

Multiple-bit adders
Figure 256
4-bit adder with Carry Look Ahead
Some other multi-bit adder architectures break the adder into blocks.
It is possible to
vary the length of these blocks based on the propagation delay of the circuits to optimize
computation time. These block based adders include the carry bypass adder7 which will
determine P and G values for each block rather than each bit, and the carry select adder8
which pre-generates sum and carry values for either possible carry input to the block.
Other adder designs include the conditional sum adder9, carry skip adder10, and carry
complete adder11.
50.3.3 Lookahead Carry Unit
By combining multiple carry look-ahead adders even larger adders can be created. This can
be used at multiple levels to make even larger adders. For example, the following adder is
a 64-bit adder that uses four 16-bit CLAs with two levels of LCUs.

51 Decoders and Encoders
51.1 Encoders
Encoders are devices that act on data to transform it in such a way that the data
acquires some new characteristics. These characteristics can vary from reduction in length
to inclusion of error correction properties to use of security measures. At the most basic
level, encoders can be used to reduce the size of data. Consider the following block diagram :
____
A ---|
|
B ---|
|-- X
C ---|
|-- Y
|____|
If out of ABCD only one is high at any given time, then we can only have the following
possibilities for input : 000, 001, 010, 100. Thus we can make the internal circuit of the
encoder in such a way that when it sees 000 it outputs 00, when it sees 001 it outputs 01,
when it sees 010 it gives 10 and when it sees 100 it outputs 11
__________
---| 000 | 00 |
---|-----|----|
---| 001 | 01 |
---|-----|----|
---| 010 | 10 |
---|-----|----|
---| 100 | 11 |
---|_____|____|
Thus we have eﬀectively reduced the size of the data, by exploiting the fact that all possible
combinations of input will never be provided at the input terminals.
The internal circuit of the encoder can be easily derived by using truth tables
_____________________
---| A | B | C ||| X | Y |
---| 0 | 0 | 0 ||| 0 | 0 |
---| 0 | 0 | 1 ||| 0 | 1 |
---| 0 | 1 | 0 ||| 1 | 0 |
---| 1 | 0 | 0 ||| 1 | 1 |
---|___|___|___|||___|___|
Clearly X = A + B and Y = A + C
So the circuit diagram can be :
351

Decoders and Encoders
A ----------[ OR ]----------X
|
B---[ OR ]
|
|-------[ OR ]----------Y
C---[ OR ]
This scheme can be extended for n inputs.
This was a very basic encoder, it could act only on data when a single line was high. It is
possible that multiple lines may be high, in that case one may use priority encoders which
assign output based on priority, that is if two lines are high, for example A and C in the
previous example, then a priority encoder will, based on a prior decision by the designer,
decide to assign output to either C or A thereby assigning it a higher priority.
In some cases we don’t want priority encoding, rather when faced with multiple signals, we
wish to create a new code for that particular combination as well, and still obtain some
reduction in size.
At other times we may wish to modify the incoming code in a manner that allows the
receiver to detect any errors that may have crept in during transmission. These topics will
be elaborated upon in appropriate topics.

52 Multiplexers
52.1 Overview
A multiplexer is a device that brings the concept of a rotary switch in analog electronics to
the digital side. It is a device which, based on some input, will change the connection of its
other inputs to its outputs. Conceptually a digital multiplexers functionality is the same as
an analog one, only it handles everything digitally. Because of the mathematical concept
of combinatorix they can be used to replace chain logic circuits. However, this is not done
frequently because multiplexer based logic has a comparably high propagation delay.
52.2 Conﬁguration

53 RAM and ROM
RAM: Random Access Memory ROM: Read Only Memory
53.1 Basics
53.1.1 Capacitors as memory
• Capacitors1 can be charged, and when they are charged they can be discharged.
• When charged they act like a source of voltage but only for a limited time unless they
are ”refreshed”.
• If charged they can be ”refreshed” by charging them again and again to keep their voltage
above a speciﬁed minimum.
This procedure can be quite automatic at regular inter-
vals and applies ONLY to capacitors that already have a voltage that is above that set
minimum.
• ”Writing” into a capacitor-memory means either charging that capacitor or discharging
it as required. We say that a memory is ”a zero” if its voltage is below a speciﬁed value,
and it is ”a one” if above. Putting a 1 into the memory means charging the capacitor,
while putting a 0 into the memory means discharging the capacitor.
• ”Reading” a capacitor-memory is equivalent to putting a voltmeter across its terminals to
see whether its voltage is or is not above a given minimum.
NOTE: Modern memories use transistors, gates, diodes, etc.
Examples
Reference 1: Programmer’s Reference Guide for the Commodore 64 Personal Computer,
published in 1988 by Commodore Business Machines, Inc.
• part of the microprocessor 6510’s characteristics:
• For a 0 the minimum is minus 0.3 Volt, and the maximum is plus 0.3 Volt.
• For a 1 the minimum is plus 2.0 Volt, and the maximum is 1 Volt above the supply
voltage which usually is about 5 Volt, but whose absolute maximum is 7.0 Volt. Note
that static electricity (by friction on the carpet for example) can cause a lot of damage
and must be guarded against.

1975 by Texas Instruments Inc.

RAM and ROM
53.1.2 Bits
• Think of ”one bit” as one memory unit, such as one capacitor-memory. It can have a 0
or a 1 ”in it”, as required; a ”High” (H) usually is a 1, and a ”Low” (L) usually is a 0. Bit
is a shortened version of binary digit.
53.1.3 Bytes
• A byte is a group of bits. One bit can only represent ”a count” of zero or one, two bits
grouped together into a byte can represent a count of zero to 3, 3 bits into a byte can
count up to 7 and n bits in a byte can count up to 2n minus 1. A byte with 8 bits in it
can count from 0 to 255. ”Words” are bytes; they each have a stated number of bits in
them.
• Bytes can also be combined; 2 bytes, each with 8 bits in it, can count up to 256 times
256 minus 1, that is 0 to 65535.
53.1.4 Words
• Words are a concept that dates back to early computer architectures, where a single ”unit”
of memory was diﬀerent from 8 bits. Common early word sizes were often 10 bits, but
sometimes six or 20 bits.
• Generally a word was deﬁned as the size of the memory bus for internal storage (i.e.
RAM or ROM), as well as the minimum independently addressable unit of memory.
• Most modern CPU architectures use independently addressable byte architecture, but
some modern CPUs (like the Pentium and other x86 CPUs) perform memory and in-
struction tasks more eﬃciently if the memory is ”aligned” on word boundaries.
• Terms like word and longword date back to 16-bit and 32-bit CPU architectures respec-
tively, and to give a common framework for backward compatible software tools. More
recently, the term quadword is used to denote a 64-bit piece of memory, although the
term octaword is sometimes used (because it is 8-bytes being accessed at once).
• Endian architecture2 deﬁnes how the memory is encoded within the RAM of the computer
and its relationship with the byte addresses.
Generally this is not an issue for most
software except when you write data ﬁles meant for consumption on multiple platforms
that have multi-byte components.
53.1.5 Address Bus connection
Just as the mail delivery person needs to have an address on each item to be deliv-
ered/collected, so also access to a particular byte of memory is ”delivered” to a particular
address, or ”collected” from a particular address.
• For example a memory can have 16 address connections, labelled 0 to 15. That means
that data can be fed into, or taken out of, a speciﬁc memory cell, whose address is between
0 and (216 minus one), which is between 0 and 65535.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness
356

RAM (Random Access Memory)
53.1.6 Data Bus connection
After the speciﬁc address has been fed into the memory, a speciﬁc given number is fed
(”written”) into the data bus connection, or the content of that address is ”read”.
• For example a memory can have 8 data connections, labelled 0 to 7. That means that
the number fed into the selected byte must be between 0 and (28 minus one), which is
between 0 and 255.
53.1.7 Read/Write connection
There is also an input terminal connection that indicates the operation required. A 0 into
that connection may indicate that the next operation will be a ”write”, while a 1 may
indicate that it will be a ”read”.
53.1.8 Clock connection
A memory may require one or more clock signals, possibly ”phase 1” and ”phase 2”, etc.,
which are inputs into the memory from oscillators, meaning they alternate very fast between
0 and 1 continuously. While the clock is, maybe, 0 various changes can be made, such as an
address change and/or a change of data, but the actual reading or writing takes place only
while the clock is, maybe, 1. Some memories include clock oscillators, possibly requiring
external crystals.
53.2 RAM (Random Access Memory)
A RAM is a ”Random Access Memory” - Sizes and their architecture vary considerably, users
can put into any of their addressed bytes any number up to a given maximum, and that
number can be replaced by another number as required, when required. Some memories
supply the complements of what was put into them.
• For example a memory with 1024 bits can require only a 0 or 1 to be put into any of
the 1024 cells, while another memory can require 4 bits (0 to 15) per word, but only 16
words can be retained at a time, etc.
Dynamic Read/Write Memories
Requires frequent refreshing.
Static Read/Write Memories
Retains the data even if control signals are absent, however such memories may use dynamic
addressing
357

RAM and ROM
53.3 ROM (Read Only Memory)
A ROM is a ”Read Only Memory”. It is factory-produced, and usually its contents are ﬁxed.
A ROM can be read, but it usually cannot be written to. Usually a ROM contains very
important ﬁxed information required for the proper operation of the equipment.
Mask-Programmed Read-Only Memories
Uses a mask during manufacture, contents cannot be altered.
Programmable Read-Only Memories
Permits a change of each cell after manufacture, but once only.
Reprogrammable Read-Only Memories
Permits changes to each cell after manufacture, more than once.

54 Registers
54.1 Registers
Registers can move two types of digital information: parallel and serial. Registers also have
two basic ways of moving it: FIFO and LIFO. The simplest register is a FIFO, which is
only one level deep and one bit wide. It is basically a single D Type Flip/Flop.
54.1.1 FIFO
A FIFO (First In First Out) is a digital device that moves data in the same way a queue
would. The ﬁrst chunk of information in is moved over as more is loaded in behind it. This
continues until it is pushed out the end. Like a grocery line.
54.1.2 LIFO
A LIFO (Last In First Out) is a like a FIFO only the data comes out in the reverse order it
came in. Data is processed like a stack data structure. Imagine putting items onto a stack,
the ﬁrst item taken oﬀwould be at the top of the stack. Thus, the last item in (item at the
top of the stack), would be the ﬁrst item out
54.1.3 Parallel
Parallel Registers take in mulitple bits at a time.
54.1.4 Shift Registers
Shift Registers are the simplest serial interfaces. They take serial data in one bit at a time
and convert it to parallel form or the other way around. The ﬁrst way is Serial In Parallel
Out and the latter is Parallel In Serial Out. Shift Registers are used to make larger state
machines like counters and UARTs.

56 Arithmetic and Logic Unit
Introduction
The Arithmetic and Logic Unit are not a single entity, but are actually composed of two
separate units whose operation is highly dependent on the Select Input(S).
This input, is a one-bit input, that will decide whether to route the binary variables to the
Arithmetic, or to the Logic Circuit.
Arithmetic Unit
Handles basic operations such as Addition and Subtraction. The Multiplication and Division
operations are dependent on the basic operations, and Bit-Shifting.
The Multiply and
Divide operations, can also be implemented using Hardwired / Microprogrammed Control.
Logic Unit
The Logic unit, is a Hardware Unit, implemented for performing basic operations such
as AND, OR, NAND, and NOT. A particular logical operation is selected using a 4:1
Demultiplexer.
The results of all the operations are routed into a data bus for memory addressing.

57 Control Unit
The Control Unit provides the Micro-Instructions that are necessary for the execution of
a program. The micro instruction that should be executed next is decided based on the
Current instruction fetched from memory and the bit values oﬀthe Various CPU status
registers such as Negative, Zero etc.
Of the two CPU architectures in use the RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computing) and
the CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computing) have diﬀerent philosophies in this regard
where the RISC believes in having a larger number of more simple Micro-instructions and
the CISC believes in a smaller number of more complex instructions.

59 Input/Output
59.1 Input
For example: a computer disk can have a lot of information on it, and the user selects a
particular disk for the task in hand. Then the user activates an input procedure to have the
computer move a copy of the given required information from the disk, where the original
remains, into a part of the computer’s memory for further use. The original on the disk
can, if desired, be deleted.
59.2 Output
For example: Some work has been done using a computer, and now the result is to be moved
from the computer onto a disk, which is one of many possible output devices. Usually the
computer’s screen, which is also an output device, shows exactly what is being done by
the user so as to ensure the information concerned ends up at the correct place, outside of
the computer. Often a printer is used, which is another output device.

60.1 RTN (Register Transfer Notation)
Register Transfer Notation is a way of using special math notation to analize diﬀerent types
of computer architectures. RTN easily shows the number of transfers and clocks required
for a given architecture to do a speciﬁc process.

62 Licenses
62.1 GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 3, 29 June 2007
Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed. Preamble
The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software
and other kinds of works.
The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By con-
trast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your
freedom to share and change all versions of a program–to make sure
it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foun-
dation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software;
it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You
can apply it to your programs, too.
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have
the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them
if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want
it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free
programs, and that you know you can do these things.
To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you
modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.
For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that
you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get
the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know
their rights.
Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) oﬀer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.
For the developers’ and authors’ protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users’ and
authors’ sake, the GPL requires that modiﬁed versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.
Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run mod-
iﬁed versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protect-
ing users’ freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of
such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which
is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed
this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If
such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to
extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL,
as needed to protect the freedom of users.
Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of soft-
ware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it eﬀectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modi-
ﬁcation follow. TERMS AND CONDITIONS 0. Deﬁnitions.
“This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
“Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds
of works, such as semiconductor masks.
“The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this Li-
cense. Each licensee is addressed as “you”. “Licensees” and “recipients”
may be individuals or organizations.
To “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of
an exact copy. The resulting work is called a “modiﬁed version” of the
earlier work or a work “based on” the earlier work.
A “covered work” means either the unmodiﬁed Program or a work
based on the Program.
To “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without per-
mission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement
under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or
modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution
(with or without modiﬁcation), making available to the public, and in
some countries other activities as well.
To “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
An interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices” to
the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible fea-
ture that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the
user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that
warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under
this License, and how to view a copy of this License.
If the inter-
face presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a
prominent item in the list meets this criterion. 1. Source Code.
The “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modiﬁcations to it. “Object code” means any non-source form
of a work.
A “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an oﬃcial
standard deﬁned by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces speciﬁed for a particular programming language, one that is
widely used among developers working in that language.
The “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form. A “Ma-
jor Component”, in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the speciﬁc operating system (if
any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce
the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
The “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts
to control those activities. However, it does not include the work’s
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodiﬁed in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface deﬁnition ﬁles associated with source ﬁles for the
work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked
subprograms that the work is speciﬁcally designed to require, such as
by intimate data communication or control ﬂow between those sub-
programs and other parts of the work.
The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can re-
generate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.
The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same
work. 2. Basic Permissions.
All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copy-
right on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated con-
ditions are met. This License explicitly aﬃrms your unlimited per-
mission to run the unmodiﬁed Program. The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not con-
vey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in
force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
of having them make modiﬁcations exclusively for you, or provide you
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not
control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary. 3. Protecting Users’ Legal Rights From Anti-
Circumvention Law.
No covered work shall be deemed part of an eﬀective technological
measure under any applicable law fulﬁlling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.
When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circum-
vention is eﬀected by exercising rights under this License with respect
to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit opera-
tion or modiﬁcation of the work as a means of enforcing, against the
work’s users, your or third parties’ legal rights to forbid circumvention
of technological measures. 4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
You may convey verbatim copies of the Program’s source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appro-
priately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep in-
tact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms
added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all no-
tices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of
this License along with the Program.
You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you con-
vey, and you may oﬀer support or warranty protection for a fee. 5.
Conveying Modiﬁed Source Versions.
You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modiﬁcations
to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
* a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modiﬁed
it, and giving a relevant date. * b) The work must carry prominent
notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions
added under section 7. This requirement modiﬁes the requirement in
section 4 to “keep intact all notices”. * c) You must license the entire
work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into pos-
session of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any
applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and
all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives
no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
invalidate such permission if you have separately received it. * d) If
the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate
Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that
do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make
them do so.
A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
“aggregate” if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used
to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation’s users beyond
what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an
aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of
the aggregate. 6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of
sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable
Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these
ways:
* a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (in-
cluding a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corre-
sponding Source ﬁxed on a durable physical medium customarily used
for software interchange. * b) Convey the object code in, or embodied
in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), ac-
companied by a written oﬀer, valid for at least three years and valid
for as long as you oﬀer spare parts or customer support for that prod-
uct model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product
that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium cus-
tomarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your
reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or
(2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at
no charge. * c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a
copy of the written oﬀer to provide the Corresponding Source. This
alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only
if you received the object code with such an oﬀer, in accord with sub-
section 6b.
* d) Convey the object code by oﬀering access from a
designated place (gratis or for a charge), and oﬀer equivalent access to
the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at
no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corre-
sponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the
object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a
diﬀerent server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equiv-
alent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to
the object code saying where to ﬁnd the Corresponding Source. Re-
gardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain
obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy
these requirements. * e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer
transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code
and Corresponding Source of the work are being oﬀered to the general
public at no charge under subsection 6d.
A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be in-
cluded in conveying the object code work.
A “User Product” is either (1) a “consumer product”, which means any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorpora-
tion into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer
product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a
particular product received by a particular user, “normally used” refers
to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the
status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular
user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A
product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has
substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such
uses represent the only signiﬁcant mode of use of the product.
“Installation Information” for a User Product means any methods, pro-
cedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
and execute modiﬁed versions of a covered work in that User Product
from a modiﬁed version of its Corresponding Source. The information
must suﬃce to ensure that the continued functioning of the modiﬁed
object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
modiﬁcation has been made.
If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
speciﬁcally for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a ﬁxed
term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corre-
sponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by
the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if
neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modi-
ﬁed object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been
installed in ROM).
The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include
a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or up-
dates for a work that has been modiﬁed or installed by the recipient,
or for the User Product in which it has been modiﬁed or installed.
Access to a network may be denied when the modiﬁcation itself ma-
terially and adversely aﬀects the operation of the network or violates
the rules and protocols for communication across the network.
Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information pro-
vided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
source code form), and must require no special password or key for
unpacking, reading or copying. 7. Additional Terms.
“Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Ad-
ditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be
treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that
they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply
only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under
those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this
License without regard to the additional permissions.
When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part
of it.
(Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders
of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
* a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability diﬀerently from the
terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or * b) Requiring preser-
vation of speciﬁed reasonable legal notices or author attributions in
that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works
containing it; or * c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of
that material, or requiring that modiﬁed versions of such material be
marked in reasonable ways as diﬀerent from the original version; or *
d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or au-
thors of the material; or * e) Declining to grant rights under trademark
law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or *
f) Requiring indemniﬁcation of licensors and authors of that material
by anyone who conveys the material (or modiﬁed versions of it) with
contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability
that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors
and authors.
All other non-permissive additional terms are considered “further re-
strictions” within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is gov-
erned by this License along with a term that is a further restriction,
you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further
restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you
may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that li-
cense document, provided that the further restriction does not survive
such relicensing or conveying.
If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
must place, in the relevant source ﬁles, a statement of the additional
terms that apply to those ﬁles, or a notice indicating where to ﬁnd the
applicable terms.
Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above
requirements apply either way. 8. Termination.
You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).
However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, un-
less and until the copyright holder explicitly and ﬁnally terminates
your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to no-
tify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days
after the cessation.
Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated
permanently if the copyright holder notiﬁes you of the violation by
some reasonable means, this is the ﬁrst time you have received notice
of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder,
and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the
notice.
Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10. 9. Acceptance Not Required for Having
Copies.
You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run
a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work oc-
curring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to
receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing
other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify
any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept
this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work,
you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so. 10. Automatic
Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically re-
ceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and prop-
agate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for
enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
An “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an or-
ganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an orga-
nization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work
results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who
receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work
the party’s predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous
paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of
the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or
can get it with reasonable eﬀorts.
You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or aﬃrmed under this License. For example, you may
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights
granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (in-
cluding a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any
patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, oﬀering for sale, or
importing the Program or any portion of it. 11. Patents.
A “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The
work thus licensed is called the contributor’s “contributor version”.
A contributor’s “essential patent claims” are all patent claims owned
or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter
acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this
License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do
not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of
further modiﬁcation of the contributor version. For purposes of this
deﬁnition, “control” includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a
manner consistent with the requirements of this License.
Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor’s essential patent claims, to make,
use, sell, oﬀer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propa-
gate the contents of its contributor version.
In the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a
patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant
not to sue for patent infringement). To “grant” such a patent license
to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to
enforce a patent against the party.
If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through
a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the beneﬁt of the patent
license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent
with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to
downstream recipients.
“Knowingly relying” means you have actual
knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the cov-
ered work in a country, or your recipient’s use of the covered work
in a country, would infringe one or more identiﬁable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.
If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrange-
ment, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered
work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the
covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a
speciﬁc copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is
automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works
based on it.
A patent license is “discriminatory” if it does not include within the
scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the
non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are speciﬁcally granted
under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are
a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business
of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third
party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and
under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would
receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a)
in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or
copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection
with speciﬁc products or compilations that contain the covered work,
unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was
granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any
implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise
be available to you under applicable patent law. 12. No Surrender of
Others’ Freedom.
If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement
or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do
not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot con-
vey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations
under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a con-
sequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to
terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from
those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy

both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from
conveying the Program. 13. Use with the GNU Aﬀero General Public
License.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permis-
sion to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under
version 3 of the GNU Aﬀero General Public License into a single com-
bined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this Li-
cense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but
the special requirements of the GNU Aﬀero General Public License,
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
combination as such. 14. Revised Versions of this License.
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new ver-
sions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may diﬀer
in detail to address new problems or concerns.
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
speciﬁes that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Pub-
lic License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or
of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.
If
the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General
Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free
Software Foundation.
If the Program speciﬁes that a proxy can decide which future versions
of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy’s public
statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to
choose that version for the Program.
Later license versions may give you additional or diﬀerent permissions.
However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copy-
right holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version. 15.
Disclaimer of Warranty.
THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EX-
TENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLD-
ERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM
“AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EX-
PRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK
AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PRO-
GRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DE-
FECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SER-
VICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 16. Limitation of Liability.
IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR
AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER,
OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCI-
DENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF
THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING
BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING REN-
DERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR
THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPER-
ATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER
OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY
OF SUCH DAMAGES. 17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above
cannot be given local legal eﬀect according to their terms, reviewing
courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an abso-
lute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a
warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program
in return for a fee.
END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS How to Apply These Terms
to Your New Programs
If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
terms.
To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
attach them to the start of each source ﬁle to most eﬀectively state the
exclusion of warranty; and each ﬁle should have at least the “copyright”
line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
<one line to give the program’s name and a brief idea of what it does.>
Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>
This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at
your option) any later version.
This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty
of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PUR-
POSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.
You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
along with this program. If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper
mail.
If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice
like this when it starts in an interactive mode:
<program> Copyright (C) <year> <name of author> This program
comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type ‘show
w’. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under
certain conditions; type ‘show c’ for details.
The hypothetical commands ‘show w’ and ‘show c’ should show the
appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, your pro-
gram’s commands might be diﬀerent; for a GUI interface, you would
use an “about box”.
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
school, if any, to sign a “copyright disclaimer” for the program, if nec-
essary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the
GNU GPL, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your
program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine
library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary
applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the
GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License. But ﬁrst,
please read <http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.
62.2 GNU Free Documentation License
Version 1.3, 3 November 2008
Copyright © 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation,
Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed. 0. PREAMBLE
The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document ”free” in the sense of freedom: to as-
sure everyone the eﬀective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or
without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Sec-
ondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to
get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for
modiﬁcations made by others.
This License is a kind of ”copyleft”, which means that derivative works
of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It com-
plements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license
designed for free software.
We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free pro-
gram should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this Li-
cense principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.
1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS
This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can
be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work
under the conditions stated herein. The ”Document”, below, refers to
any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and
is addressed as ”you”. You accept the license if you copy, modify or
distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law.
A ”Modiﬁed Version” of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modiﬁca-
tions and/or translated into another language.
A ”Secondary Section” is a named appendix or a front-matter sec-
tion of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of
the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document’s overall
subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part
a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connec-
tion with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial,
philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.
The ”Invariant Sections” are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that
says that the Document is released under this License. If a section does
not ﬁt the above deﬁnition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be
designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant
Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections
then there are none.
The ”Cover Texts” are certain short passages of text that are listed, as
Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may
be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.
A ”Transparent” copy of the Document means a machine-readable
copy, represented in a format whose speciﬁcation is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document straightfor-
wardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels)
generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing
editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic
translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters.
A copy made in an otherwise Transparent ﬁle format whose markup,
or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage sub-
sequent modiﬁcation by readers is not Transparent. An image format
is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy
that is not ”Transparent” is called ”Opaque”.
Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input for-
mat, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-
conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human
modiﬁcation. Examples of transparent image formats include PNG,
XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can
be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or
XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF pro-
duced by some word processors for output purposes only.
The ”Title Page” means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus
such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this
License requires to appear in the title page.
For works in formats
which do not have any title page as such, ”Title Page” means the text
near the most prominent appearance of the work’s title, preceding the
beginning of the body of the text.
The ”publisher” means any person or entity that distributes copies of
the Document to the public.
A section ”Entitled XYZ” means a named subunit of the Document
whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ
stands for a speciﬁc section name mentioned below, such as ”Acknowl-
edgements”, ”Dedications”, ”Endorsements”, or ”History”.) To ”Preserve
the Title” of such a section when you modify the Document means that
it remains a section ”Entitled XYZ” according to this deﬁnition.
The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
which states that this License applies to the Document. These War-
ranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other impli-
cation that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no
eﬀect on the meaning of this License. 2. VERBATIM COPYING
You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no
other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copy-
ing of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.
You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies. 3. COPYING IN QUANTITY
If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document’s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts:
Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the
back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as
the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title
with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add
other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited
to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and
satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other
respects.
If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to ﬁt legibly,
you should put the ﬁrst ones listed (as many as ﬁt reasonably) on the
actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.
If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transpar-
ent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque
copy a computer-network location from which the general network-
using public has access to download using public-standard network
protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added
material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably pru-
dent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity,
to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the
stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute
an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.
It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to
give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
Document. 4. MODIFICATIONS
You may copy and distribute a Modiﬁed Version of the Document un-
der the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modiﬁed Version under precisely this License, with the Modiﬁed
Version ﬁlling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modiﬁcation of the Modiﬁed Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modiﬁed Version:
* A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title dis-
tinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
(which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of
the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if
the original publisher of that version gives permission. * B. List on
the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible
for authorship of the modiﬁcations in the Modiﬁed Version, together
with at least ﬁve of the principal authors of the Document (all of its
principal authors, if it has fewer than ﬁve), unless they release you
from this requirement. * C. State on the Title page the name of the
publisher of the Modiﬁed Version, as the publisher.
* D. Preserve
all the copyright notices of the Document. * E. Add an appropriate
copyright notice for your modiﬁcations adjacent to the other copyright
notices. * F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
notice giving the public permission to use the Modiﬁed Version under
the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
* G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
and required Cover Texts given in the Document’s license notice. *
H. Include an unaltered copy of this License. * I. Preserve the section
Entitled ”History”, Preserve its Title, and add to it an item stating at
least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modiﬁed Ver-
sion as given on the Title Page. If there is no section Entitled ”History”
in the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and pub-
lisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item
describing the Modiﬁed Version as stated in the previous sentence. *
J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the
network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was
based on. These may be placed in the ”History” section. You may omit
a network location for a work that was published at least four years
before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it
refers to gives permission. * K. For any section Entitled ”Acknowledge-
ments” or ”Dedications”, Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve
in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor ac-
knowledgements and/or dedications given therein. * L. Preserve all
the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and
in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered
part of the section titles. * M. Delete any section Entitled ”Endorse-
ments”. Such a section may not be included in the Modiﬁed Version.
* N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled ”Endorsements”
or to conﬂict in title with any Invariant Section. * O. Preserve any
Warranty Disclaimers.
If the Modiﬁed Version includes new front-matter sections or appen-
dices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied
from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of
these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of
Invariant Sections in the Modiﬁed Version’s license notice. These titles
must be distinct from any other section titles.
You may add a section Entitled ”Endorsements”, provided it con-
tains nothing but endorsements of your Modiﬁed Version by various
parties—for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative deﬁnition of a
standard.
You may add a passage of up to ﬁve words as a Front-Cover Text,
and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end
of the list of Cover Texts in the Modiﬁed Version. Only one passage
of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by
(or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document
already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by
you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on
behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one,
on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old
one.
The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this Li-
cense give permission to use their names for publicity for or to as-
sert or imply endorsement of any Modiﬁed Version. 5. COMBINING
DOCUMENTS
You may combine the Document with other documents released under
this License, under the terms deﬁned in section 4 above for modiﬁed
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the In-
variant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodiﬁed, and list
them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license
notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.
The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.
If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
but diﬀerent contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original au-
thor or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant
Sections in the license notice of the combined work.
In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled ”History”
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled ”His-
tory”; likewise combine any sections Entitled ”Acknowledgements”, and
any sections Entitled ”Dedications”. You must delete all sections En-
titled ”Endorsements”. 6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS
You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other doc-
uments released under this License, and replace the individual copies
of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is
included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this
License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other
respects.
You may extract a single document from such a collection, and dis-
tribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy
of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License
in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document. 7.
AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS
A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an ”aggregate” if the copyright resulting
from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the com-
pilation’s users beyond what the individual works permit. When the
Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to
the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative
works of the Document.
If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies
of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the
entire aggregate, the Document’s Cover Texts may be placed on cov-
ers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic
equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise
they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.
8. TRANSLATION
Translation is considered a kind of modiﬁcation, so you may distribute
translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing
Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from
their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all
Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invari-
ant Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and all the
license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, pro-
vided that you also include the original English version of this License
and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a
disagreement between the translation and the original version of this
License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.
If a section in the Document is Entitled ”Acknowledgements”, ”Dedi-
cations”, or ”History”, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title
(section 1) will typically require changing the actual title. 9. TERMI-
NATION
You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt oth-
erwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, un-
less and until the copyright holder explicitly and ﬁnally terminates
your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to no-
tify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days
after the cessation.
Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated
permanently if the copyright holder notiﬁes you of the violation by
some reasonable means, this is the ﬁrst time you have received notice
of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder,
and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the
notice.
Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does
not give you any rights to use it. 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS
LICENSE
The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.
Such
new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but
may diﬀer in detail to address new problems or concerns.
See
http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.
Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
If the Document speciﬁes that a particular numbered version of this
License ”or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that speciﬁed version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published
(not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document
speciﬁes that a proxy can decide which future versions of this License
can be used, that proxy’s public statement of acceptance of a version
permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.
11. RELICENSING
”Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site” (or ”MMC Site”) means any
World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works. A public
wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server. A ”Massive
Multiauthor Collaboration” (or ”MMC”) contained in the site means
any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site.
”CC-BY-SA” means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike
3.0 license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-
proﬁt corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license published
by that same organization.
”Incorporate” means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
in part, as part of another Document.
An MMC is ”eligible for relicensing” if it is licensed under this License,
and if all works that were ﬁrst published under this License somewhere
other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole or in
part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections, and
(2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.
The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in
the site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August
1, 2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing. ADDENDUM:
How to use this License for your documents
To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy
of the License in the document and put the following copyright and

62.3 GNU Lesser General Public License
GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 3, 29 June 2007
Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed.
This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public Li-
cense, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.
0.
Additional Deﬁnitions.
As used herein, “this License” refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, and the “GNU GPL” refers to version 3 of the
GNU General Public License.
“The Library” refers to a covered work governed by this License, other
than an Application or a Combined Work as deﬁned below.
An “Application” is any work that makes use of an interface provided
by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Deﬁn-
ing a subclass of a class deﬁned by the Library is deemed a mode of
using an interface provided by the Library.
A “Combined Work” is a work produced by combining or linking an
Application with the Library. The particular version of the Library
with which the Combined Work was made is also called the “Linked
Version”.
The “Minimal Corresponding Source” for a Combined Work means the
Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source
code for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation,
are based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.
The “Corresponding Application Code” for a Combined Work means
the object code and/or source code for the Application, including any
data and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work
from the Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Com-
bined Work. 1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.
You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL. 2. Conveying
Modiﬁed Versions.
If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modiﬁcations, a fa-
cility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that
uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility
is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modiﬁed version:
* a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith eﬀort to
ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the function
or data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its
purpose remains meaningful, or * b) under the GNU GPL, with none
of the additional permissions of this License applicable to that copy.
3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.
The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
a header ﬁle that is part of the Library. You may convey such object
code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated ma-
terial is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts
and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates (ten or
fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:
* a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License. * b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU
GPL and this license document.
4. Combined Works.
You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
taken together, eﬀectively do not restrict modiﬁcation of the portions
of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineer-
ing for debugging such modiﬁcations, if you also do each of the follow-
ing:
* a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work
that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
covered by this License. * b) Accompany the Combined Work with a
copy of the GNU GPL and this license document. * c) For a Com-
bined Work that displays copyright notices during execution, include
the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as a
reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this
license document.
* d) Do one of the following: o 0) Convey the
Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, and
the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and under
terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application
with a modiﬁed version of the Linked Version to produce a modiﬁed
Combined Work, in the manner speciﬁed by section 6 of the GNU
GPL for conveying Corresponding Source. o 1) Use a suitable shared
library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism
is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already present
on the user’s computer system, and (b) will operate properly with a
modiﬁed version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the
Linked Version. * e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you
would otherwise be required to provide such information under section
6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
necessary to install and execute a modiﬁed version of the Combined
Work produced by recombining or relinking the Application with a
modiﬁed version of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0, the
Installation Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding
Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1,
you must provide the Installation Information in the manner speciﬁed
by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)
5. Combined Libraries.
You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library
side by side in a single library together with other library facilities that
are not Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey
such a combined library under terms of your choice, if you do both of
the following:
* a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
conveyed under the terms of this License. * b) Give prominent no-
tice with the combined library that part of it is a work based on the
Library, and explaining where to ﬁnd the accompanying uncombined
form of the same work.
6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new ver-
sions of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but
may diﬀer in detail to address new problems or concerns.
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library
as you received it speciﬁes that a certain numbered version of the GNU
Lesser General Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you
have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that
published version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation. If the Library as you received it does not specify a version
number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose
any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever published
by the Free Software Foundation.
If the Library as you received it speciﬁes that a proxy can decide
whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License
shall apply, that proxy’s public statement of acceptance of any ver-
sion is permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
Library.
