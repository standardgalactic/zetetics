CHAPTER 9
Gravity Waves
Fermi discusses waves that propagate on the surface of oceans
and lakes. The ﬂuid in question is water and gravity is the
external force acting on the ﬂuid. Such waves are often called
“gravity waves.” These are not to be confused with the re-
cently detected waves of the same name discovered in 2015.
The latter represent oscillations of the very fabric of space
and time. The gravity waves which propagate on the sur-
face of water have a counterpart in surface seismic waves, the
subject of Chap. (13).
9.1
Dispersion Relations
The relation between frequency f and wavelength λ of any
wave is called its “dispersion relation.”
Rather than a for-
mula for f(λ), the relation is often expressed as ω(k), where
ω = 2πf, and wave number k = 2π/λ. In either language, the
dispersion relation determines the velocity of propagation of

132
CHAPTER 9. GRAVITY WAVES
the waves. There are actually two velocities. The phase ve-
locity, vp, is deﬁned by
vp ≡ω
k = fλ = λ
T ,
where T is the period. For an inﬁnitely long wave, the phase
velocity speciﬁes the velocity of propagation of surfaces of
constant amplitude or “phase.” However, inﬁnitely long waves
with deﬁnite frequency and wavelength are an idealization.
A physically realizable wave is constructed by superposing a
continuum of wavelengths near a dominant wavelength. Such
wave packets, as they are called, move with the group velocity,
vg, deﬁned by
vg ≡∂ω
∂k =
∂f
∂(1/λ).
(9.1)
9.2
Euler’s Equation and the
Equation of Continuity
The equations of ﬂuid dynamics are macroscopic equations,
replacing a microscopic description at the molecular level
with a small number of average quantities: (1) the mass den-
sity ρ; (2) the local velocity v; and (3) the pressure p. This is
similar to what is done in thermodynamics, but variation of
quantities in space and time are allowed in ﬂuid dynamics.
For the analysis of surface waves in water, one of the two
ﬂuid equations needed is the equation of continuity,
∂ρ
∂t + ∇· (ρv) = 0,
(9.2)
which states that water is neither created nor destroyed. It is
very similar to the equation in electrodynamics stating that
electric charge is neither created nor destroyed.

9.2. EULER’S EQUATION
133
The other equation needed is Euler’s equation,
ρ(∂v
∂t + v · ∇v) = −∇p −ρ∇Vg,
(9.3)
where Vg is the gravitational potential.
For waves travel-
ing on the surface of the ocean or a lake, Vg is given by the
elementary formula Vg = gz, where z is the local vertical
coordinate.1 Euler’s equation is the expression of Newton’s
second law for a ﬂuid.
The right-hand side of Eq. (9.3) is
the force/volume acting on the ﬂuid. The term −∇p is the
force/volume produced by the spatial variation of pressure.
A diﬀerence of pressure on opposite sides of a small volume of
ﬂuid produces a net force in the direction of decreasing pres-
sure. The term in Vg is the force/volume exerted on water by
the Earth’s gravity. Water is accurately described as an “ideal
ﬂuid,” meaning viscous forces are negligible, so there are no
other terms on the right side of Eq. (9.3). The left side of
Euler’s equation is the rate of change of momentum/volume
of the ﬂuid. In Newton’s second law, as applied to the mo-
tion of a projectile, the acceleration is evaluated along the
trajectory of the projectile. The same must hold for a small
volume of ﬂuid. Such a volume may have a velocity at time
t of v(x, t). At an instant dt later, the velocity of this small
volume including its motion is
v(x+vdt, t+dt) = v(x, t)+(∂v
∂t (x, t)+v·∇v(x, t))dt. (9.4)
From this, we see that the rate of change of v moving with
the ﬂuid is
∂v
∂t (x, t) + v · ∇v(x, t)

.
(9.5)
The presence of the v ·∇v term makes Euler’s equation non-
linear and very diﬃcult to solve. We will proceed by ignoring
1Note that in this section the z axis points upward.

134
CHAPTER 9. GRAVITY WAVES
quadratic terms in the velocity, and deﬁne the conditions for
which this is valid after the solution of the linearized equation
has been found.
9.3
Small Amplitude Surface Waves
Water occupies the region z < 0, with the atmosphere in the
region z > 0. We are seeking a surface wave, one whose am-
plitude is largest at the water surface, damped when moving
deeper into the water.
As is typical for most ﬂuid waves,
there are no vortices present, so ∇× v = 0. This allows the
velocity to be derived from a velocity potential,
v = ∇φ.
(9.6)
Treating the density of water as constant, and using the conti-
nuity equation, Eq. (9.2), we also have ∇·v = 0. The vanish-
ing of ∇·v along with Eq. (9.6) implies the Laplace equation
for φ,
∇· v = 0 →∇2φ = 0.
(9.7)
Euler’s equation (for the case where quadratic terms in the
velocity can be neglected) is
ρ∂v
∂t = −∇(p + ρgz).
(9.8)
As discussed explicitly below, ignoring quadratic terms in
the velocity is justiﬁed if the wavelength of the wave is large
compared to the amplitude of the wave.
Using Eq. (9.6) and the constancy of ρ to rewrite Eq. (9.8),
we have
ρ ∂
∂t∇φ = ∇(ρ∂φ
∂t ) = −∇(p + ρgz).
(9.9)

9.3. SMALL AMPLITUDE SURFACE WAVES
135
It is desirable to remove the gradient operator in Eq. (9.9) and
get an equation relating the time derivative of the velocity
potential directly to the pressure and gravitational potential.
To proceed, consider ﬁrst the case where the ﬂuid is at rest
and φ ≡0. Then we have
∇(p + ρgz) = 0.
(9.10)
If the surface of the water is at z = 0, the pressure is the
atmospheric pressure, pa. The solution to Eq. (9.10) is given
by the barometric formula
pb(z) + ρgz = pa.
(9.11)
Returning to Eq. (9.9), we will take φ to be a traveling wave
which satisﬁes Laplace’s equation in spatial variables. Re-
moving the gradient, we now write
−ρ∂φ
∂t = p −pb = p −pa + ρgz.
(9.12)
Eq. (9.12) builds in the barometric formula when the ampli-
tude of the traveling wave is reduced to zero. We take our
surface wave to be moving in the x direction with wave num-
ber k and frequency ω. As a trial form, we set
φ = A cos(kx −ωt)ekz.
(9.13)
Computing second derivatives, we have
∂2φ
∂x2 = −k2φ,
(9.14)
∂2φ
∂z2 = k2φ,
so Laplace’s equation is satisﬁed.
Writing the exponential
factor in φ as exp(2πz/λ), we see that the penetration depth

136
CHAPTER 9. GRAVITY WAVES
is λ/2π, so longer wavelengths penetrate more deeply into the
ocean.2
Returning to Eq. (9.12), we have
−ρωA sin(kx −ωt)ekz = p −pa + ρgz.
(9.15)
When the wave is present, the surface of the water is no longer
at z = 0, but at a variable distance, z = ξ(x, t). The pressure
at the surface is of course still atmospheric. At z = ξ(x, t)
and atmospheric pressure, Eq. (9.15) becomes
−ρωA sin(kx −ωt)ekξ = ρgξ.
(9.16)
This equation determines the wave amplitude ξ(x, t). How-
ever, there is no need to solve it exactly. We are interested
in waves of small amplitude, i.e., amplitude much less than
the wavelength. Since kξ = 2πξ/λ, we have kξ << 1, so the
factor exp(kξ) ∼1. Setting exp(kξ) = 1, Eq. (9.16) now gives
an explicit formula for ξ(x, t). Taking the time derivative of
ξ gives the z component of velocity at the water’s surface,
∂ξ
∂t = (vz)surface = ω2
g A cos(kx −ωt).
(9.17)
But vz at any point in the water or on its surface is given by
vz = ∂φ
∂z .
Taking the derivative with respect to z of Eq. (9.13), we have
vz = kA cos(kx −ωt)ekz.
(9.18)
Evaluating this at z = ξ, again setting exp(kξ) = 1, gives a
second formula for the z component of velocity at the surface,
(vz)surface = kA cos(kx −ωt).
(9.19)
2In Appendix C, we analyze a surface wave that travels in the Earth’s
crust, where again the penetration depth is controlled by the wavelength.

9.3. SMALL AMPLITUDE SURFACE WAVES
137
Equating the two expressions gives
ω2
g A cos(kx −ωt) = kA cos(kx −ωt),
(9.20)
which gives the dispersion relation
ω2 = kg.

(9.23)
In the present approximation, discussed in the next section,
surface waves can be superposed, interfere, scatter oﬀislands,
etc. Much more detail on these topics is given in Kinsman’s
book (Kinsman 1965).
Criterion for Dropping Quadratic Terms in Fluid Ve-
locity
When is it valid to drop quadratic terms in the ﬂuid
velocity? If quadratic terms are to be ignored, we must have
∂v
∂t >> v · ∇v.
(9.24)
For a wave with frequency ω and wave vector k, this condition
becomes
ωv >> v · kv.
(9.25)
Canceling a factor of v, and dividing by k, Eq. (9.25) becomes
vp = ω
k >> |v|.
(9.26)

138
CHAPTER 9. GRAVITY WAVES
This says that the phase (or group) velocity should be large
compared to the velocity of the particles in the ﬂuid. For
particles at the surface of the ﬂuid, the velocity is ∼kA ∼
A/λ, so dropping quadratic terms is justiﬁed if
A
λ <<
p
gλ.
(9.27)
For a ﬁxed A, this criterion will be satisﬁed for suﬃciently
large wavelength λ, or for a ﬁxed wavelength, it will be satis-
ﬁed for suﬃciently small A. As a numerical example, suppose
λ = 10 m. For this wavelength, vp ∼4 m/s. Then A/λ << vp
will be satisﬁed for A/λ in the range of 0.4 m/s or smaller.
Surface Waves in Water of Finite Depth
The preced-
ing discussion described the case where the depth of the body
of water being considered was eﬀectively inﬁnite. The case
of water of ﬁnite depth, h, can be treated by a simple gener-
alization of the trial form of Eq. (9.13). For a ﬁnite depth of
water, both exp(kz) and exp(−kz) are allowed in the veloc-
ity potential. The boundary condition at the bottom of the
body of water is that the velocity normal to the surface must
vanish, i.e., vz = 0. A trial form that satisﬁes the Laplace
equation is
φ = Acosh[k(z + h)]
cosh(kh)
cos(kx −ωt).
(9.28)
The z component of velocity is
vz = ∂φ
∂z = Aksinh[k(z + h)]
cosh(kh)
cos(kx −ωt).
(9.29)
This vanishes at z = −h, so the boundary condition at the
bottom of the body of water is satisﬁed.
The rest of the

9.3. SMALL AMPLITUDE SURFACE WAVES
139
calculation proceeds in a similar manner to the case of un-
limited depth. Eq. (9.12) applies here as well. Taking the
time derivative of φ, the generalization of Eq. (9.15) is
−ρωAcosh[k(z + h)]
cosh(kh)
sin(kx −ωt) = p −pa + ρgz.
(9.30)
We have atmospheric pressure at the water’s surface, and
z = ξ(x, t). At the surface, Eq. (9.30) reduces to
−ρωAcosh[k(ξ + h)]
cosh(kh)
sin(kx −ωt) = ρgξ.
(9.31)
Ignoring ξ compared to h, we obtain an explicit formula for
ξ,
ξ(x, t) = −ωA
g sin(kx −ωt).
(9.32)
The time derivative of ξ gives (vz)surface. Equating this to
(vz)surface obtained from Eq. (9.29) gives
ω2A
g
cos(kx −ωt) = Ak tanh(kh) cos(kx −ωt),
(9.33)
where we again ignore ξ compared to h. Dividing common
factors on both sides, the dispersion relation for surface grav-
ity waves in water of ﬁnite depth is
ω2 = gk tanh(kh).
(9.34)
We see that Eq. (9.34) reduces to Eq. (9.21 ) when kh >> 1,
or h >> λ/2π. Actually, since tanh(2πh/λ) approaches unity
rapidly, Eq. (9.34) is essentially exact once h > λ/2.
Qualitative Behavior
One of the most interesting fea-
tures of surface gravity waves is the nonlinear relationship be-
tween wavelength and period. Taking the case where h > λ/2
and Eq. (9.21) is valid, we have
λ = g
2πT 2,
(9.35)

where λ = 2π/k is the wavelength and T = 2π/ω the period.
In Table (9.1), we show the period, wavelength, and phase
velocity for various periods. The behavior seen in the table
is quite diﬀerent from waves such as sound and light waves,
where the wavelength grows linearly with T, and the phase
velocity is independent of T.
Table (9.1) is for the case h > λ/2, where Eq. (9.21) holds.
For waves on the open ocean, taking a typical depth of h =
4000 m, such waves will not “feel the bottom” for λ < 8000 m
or T < 72 s. Now suppose a wave of period T < 72 s moves
from the open ocean, with wavelength given by Eq. (9.35),
into shallow waters, where λ < h/2 is no longer satisﬁed.
Using Eq. (9.34), we have
λ = g
2πT 2 tanh(2πh
λ ).
(9.36)
From this equation, we can see that if h is signiﬁcantly less
than λ, the wavelength will be smaller than its large h value
given by Eq. (9.35), so for a given period of the wave, the
wavelength decreases when the wave moves from the open
ocean toward the shore. As an example, suppose T = 10 s. In
the deep ocean, this corresponds to a wavelength λ = 156 m.
Moving to shallower water, the wavelength is reduced to ∼
70 m at a depth of h = 12 m.
Fermi considers two situations: that of a wave sweeping

9.3. SMALL AMPLITUDE SURFACE WAVES
141
across either a lake or an ocean, both involving h ≪λ and
therefore both making use of Eq. (9.36). For h << λ, Eq. (9.36)
simpliﬁes to
λ =
p
ghT,
(9.37)
so in this limit, surface waves have velocity independent of
period. For a lake of depth h = 300 m and width a = 20 km,
a wave with a maximum on one side and a minimum on the
other side will have λ = 2a = 4 × 104 m. Eq. (9.37) gives
T = 738 s.
For the analogous case of an ocean tide, Fermi chooses h ∼
4000 m, a depth lying roughly in between the average depths
of the Paciﬁc and Atlantic Oceans, and as width he chooses
a ∼4000 km. In this case the period for the disturbance is
T ∼4 × 104 s,
a little less than 12 hours. The ocean, or any body of water,
has its own characteristic modes of oscillation. In addition,
ocean tides are driven by the gravitational forces of the Sun
and Moon. This is discussed in detail in the next chapter.
