Magic Angle Spinning
Magic angle spinning (MAS) in solid-state NMR makes use of the fact that
the energy of the interactions between parallel magnetic dipole and also
the anisotropies in chemical shifts are proportional to 13 cos2y, where
y is the angle that the magnetic moments make to the vector that joins
them. The ‘magic angle’ is the angle at which 1 3 cos2y ¼ 0, which is
54.748. In the technique, the sample is spun at high speed at this angle to
the applied field and the anisotropies average to zero.
Magnetic Moment
The magnetic moment, m, of a body is the magnitude of its magnetic
dipole moment, l. An electron has an intrinsic magnetic moment due
to its spin, s:
l ¼ ges ¼  ge(mB=ˉh)s;
ge ¼  gee
2me
;
mB ¼ eˉh
2me
where ge is the magnetogyric ratio (or gyromagnetic ratio) of the elec-
tron, mB is the Bohr magneton, and ge is the g-factor of the electron.
Their values are as follows:

An electron may also possess a magnetic moment by virtue of its
orbital angular momentum, l:
l ¼  (mB=ˉh)l
A consequence of the spin magnetic moment being anomalously
large (due to the presence of geE2) is that the magnetic moment of
an atom in a state with total angular momentum quantum number J
is not related simply to the total orbital angular momentum quantum
number L and the total spin angular momentum S. Instead (with ge
approximated by the integer 2),
l ¼  gJ(L; S)(mB=ˉh) J;
gJ(L; S) ¼ J( J þ 1) þ S(S þ 1)  L(L þ 1)
2J( J þ 1)
where gJ(L,S) is the Landé g-factor.
Nuclei with nonzero spin I (and the neutron) possess a magnetic
moment:
l ¼ gNI ¼ gN(mN=ˉh)I;
mN ¼ eˉh
2mp
where gN is the nuclear magnetogyric ratio, gN is the nuclear g-factor,
and mN is the nuclear magneton. The first two depend on the identity of
the nucleus and its internal structure; the value of the last is

Magnetic Susceptibility
The magnetic susceptibility (or volume magnetic susceptibility), w, is the
constant of proportionality between the magnetic moment density, M,
and the strength of the applied field, H :

With M and H both in A m1, w is dimensionless and may be of either
sign. Materials for which wo1 are classified as diamagnetic; those for
which w 4 1 are classified as paramagnetic. The molar magnetic sus-
ceptibility, wm, is defined as
wm ¼ wVm
where Vm is the molar volume of the sample; wm has the dimensions
of molar volume (m3 mol1).
At a molecular level, an applied magnetic field induces a magnetic
dipole moment, l, with
l ¼ xB
where x is the magnetizability of the molecule (the magnetic analogue
of electric polarizability) and B is the magnetic flux density. Field
strength H and flux density B are related by B ¼ m0(H þ M). The units
of magnetic flux density are tesla, T, and those of magnetizability are
J T2. Note that 1 T ¼ 1 Wb m1, with Wb denoting weber, and
equivalently 1 T ¼ 1 J A1 m2. The magnetic susceptibility of a
sample arises from both the induced moment and any permanent
magnetic moment due to electron spin, and

Marcus Theory
Marcus theory provides a theoretical framework for the discussion of
electron transfer reactions. Its core concept is that an electron can
migrate from donor to acceptor only when the donor and acceptor
have distorted to the point at which their molecular potential energy
curves intersect and tunnelling is thereby facilitated. The core equa-
tions are as follows:
Rate constant: kr ¼ k(kT=h)ebreDzG-=RT
Activation Gibbs energy: DzG- ¼ (DreorgG- þ DrG-)2=4DreorgG-
Cross-relation: kr;DA ¼ (kr;AAkr;DDKDA)1=2f

Here, kr,DA is the rate constant of interest, that for the transfer D-A,
kr,AA and kr,DD are the rate constants for the two self-exchange pro-
cesses (D - D and A - A), and KDA is the equilibrium constant for the
overall reaction. The factor f is a combination of a variety of factors,
including encounter rates, and is often set equal to 1 in approximate
calculations.
Maxwell Construction
The Maxwell construction is a procedure for replacing the van der
Waals loops in isotherms by horizontal lines. The line is placed such
that the areas of the loops on each side of the line are the same
(Figure M.1). The construction is based on the requirement that an
integral of dU around the cycle ABCDEA must be zero because the
internal energy U is a state function. However, because only expansion
work is allowed, it follows that the integral
þ
pdV ¼ 0; so the areas
between the area shown shaded must be equal.

Mean Bond Enthalpy
The mean bond enthalpy, DH(AB), is the AB bond dissociation enthalpy
averaged over a range of similar compounds.
Melting Point
The melting temperature is the temperature at which the solid and
liquid phases of a substance are in equilibrium at a given pressure;
the normal melting point is the melting temperature when that pres-
sure is 1 atm. The standard melting temperature is the melting tem-
perature when the pressure is 1 bar. The freezing temperature is the
same as the melting temperature in all but certain exotic materials. The
melting temperature of a biopolymer is the temperature at which
50 per cent of its natural form has undergone degradation. Poly-
disperse polymers typically melt over a range of temperatures.
Mesophase
A mesophase is a phase intermediate in character between a solid and
a liquid, specifically with long-range order in one direction and short-
range order in other directions. See liquid crystal.
Metastable Phase
A metastable phase is a phase that is thermodynamically unstable but
prevented by kinetic reasons from undergoing a transition to a stable
phase. Examples are superheated and supercooled liquids.

Michaelis–Menten Mechanism
The original formulation of the Michaelis–Menten mechanism of enzyme
action proposed that an enzyme E establishes a pre-equilibrium con-
centration of the bound substrate, ES, with the substrate, S, and then
goes on to form a product at the rate v ¼ d P
½ =dt with rate constant kr:
E þ S " ES ! E þ P;
v ¼ kr[E]0;
kr ¼
kr;2[S]
Kc- þ [S] ;
K ¼ [ES]c-
[E][S]
Here, [E]0 is the total concentration of enzyme: [E]0 ¼ [E] þ [ES].
A more flexible formulation treats the forward and reverse reactions
involving the complex individually, with forward and reverse rate
constants kr,1 and k0r;1, respectively, and applies the steady-state ap-
proximation to establish its concentration. Then
E þ S $ ES ! E þ P;
v ¼ kr[E]0;
kr ¼
kr;2[S]
KM þ [S] ;
KM ¼ kr;1 þ k0r;1
kr;2
In this expression, KM is the Michaelis constant; note that it has di-
mensions of molar concentration.
The maximum velocity, vmax, of the reaction occurs when [S] c KM,
and then
vmax ¼ kr;2[E]0
The rate constant kr,2 is called the maximum turnover number. It fol-
lows from this relation and the general rate law given above that

Therefore, a Lineweaver–Burk plot (Figure M.3) of 1=v against 1/[S]
should give a straight line with slope KM=vmax and intercept with the
vertical axis (where 1/[S] ¼ 0) at 1=vmax and extrapolated intercept with
the horizontal axis at 1/KM.
Miller Indices
The Miller indices (hkl) are used to label a plane in a crystal (Figure M.4);
sets of parallel planes are denoted {hkl}. They are constructed as follows.
1. Write the intersections of the plane with the three crystallo-
graphic axes as multiples of the unit cell dimensions a, b, and c.
2. Take reciprocals of these multiples.
3. Clear fractions.
A negative index is denoted by an overbar, as in (12̄3). The distance,
dhkl, between neighbouring {hkl} planes in an orthorhombic (right-
angled) lattice is given by

The separation of the planes in which the indices are all increased by
a factor n is reduced by that factor. Structure factors, Fhkl, in X-ray
crystallography are labelled with Miller indices.
Mirror Plane
A mirror plane, s, is a symmetry element corresponding to the oper-
ation of reflection (Figure M.5). If the plane is horizontal to the
principal axis of symmetry it is denoted sh; if the principal axis lies in

plane (see that entry) is denoted sd.
mmHg (the unit)
The outmoded unit 1 mmHg (millimetre of mercury) was used to re-
port the pressure of a gas. It is defined as the pressure exerted at the
base of a column of mercury of height 1 mm when the density is
13.5951 g cm3 and the acceleration of free fall, g, has its standard
value. It follows from this definition that 1 atm E760 mmHg. The
millimetre of mercury has been largely superseded by 1 Torr, with
1 atm ¼ 760 Torr (exactly). In all except the most precise work the
units 1 mmHg and 1 Torr can be used synonymously, but in fact
1 mmHg E 1.000 000 142 Torr.
Mobility
The mobility, u, of an ion of charge number z in solution is the con-
stant of proportionality between its drift speed, s, and the strength of
the applied electric field strength, E:
s ¼ uE
The drift speed is the final speed the ion reaches as result of the
competition between the driving force of the electric field and the
retarding force of friction:
s ¼ jzjeE
f
where f is the frictional coeﬃcient. It follows that
u ¼ jzje

If the frictional force is given by Stokes’ law ( f ¼ 6pZa, where a is the
hydrodynamic radius of the ion and Z the viscosity), then
u ¼ jzje

Molality
The molality, bJ, is the amount of solute J of solute divided by the mass
of the solvent: bJ ¼ nJ/msolvent. Molalities are commonly reported in
moles of solute per kilogram of solvent. A convenient quantity is
b- ¼ 1 mol kg1. Unlike molar concentration, cJ, molality is in-
dependent of temperature. The relations between molality and mole

cJ ¼ nJ/Vsolution. A convenient quantity is c- ¼ 1 mol dm3. The

Molar Mass
The molar mass of an element or compound, M, is the isotopic-com-
position-averaged mass of a formula unit multiplied by Avogadro’s
constant: M(X) ¼ mXNA. The traditional terms atomic weight, molecular
weight, and formula weight are widely used to refer to the dimen-
sionless quantity M(X)/(g mol1). Polymeric materials and some bio-
logical macromolecules are rarely exactly monodisperse (that is, have a
single, precise molar mass), and three types of average molar mass are
encountered, the number-average molar mass, M̄ n, the weight-average
(or mass-average) molar mass, M̄ w, and the Z-average molar mass, M̄ Z:

scattering the weight-average molar mass, and the sedimentation the

Z-average molar mass. In practice, average molar masses are treated
as empirical averages and not interpreted strictly in terms of mean
square and mean cube molar mass. If all the molecules in the sample
have the same molar mass, all three averages give the same value. The
dispersity, Đ, of a sample is defined as
Đ ¼

A synthetic sample is classified as monodisperse if Đ o1.1. Samples
for which the dispersity is larger are classified as polydisperse.

molar mass. That is incorrect: 1 Da ¼ mu, where mu ¼ m(12C)/12
E1.660 539 066 60  1027 kg is the atomic mass constant, a measure
of atomic or molecular mass, not molar mass.
Molar Quantity
A molar quantity, Xm, is defined as X/n, where n is the amount of sub-
stance in the sample. Molar quantities are intensive. An exception to this
notational convention is the molar mass, which is commonly denoted
simply M. Two other exceptions to the definition are molar conductivity,
Lm, in which the divisor is the molar concentration of the electrolyte,
and the molar concentration, cJ or [ J], itself. The latter is more properly
but hardly ever called the amount of substance concentration.
mole (the unit)
The unit 1 mole (1 mol) is used to report the amount of substance nJ of
specified entities J in a sample, with 1 mol ¼ 6.022 140 76 1023 en-
tities exactly. In practice, a desired amount of entities is measured out
by noting the mass of the sample, m, and then using nJ ¼ m/MJ, where
MJ is the molar mass of J.

Molecular Beam
A molecular beam is a narrow stream of molecules with a narrow spread
of speeds and in some cases in specific internal state states or orien-
tation. Molecular beam studies of nonreactive collisions are used to
explore the details of molecular interactions with a view to determining
theintermolecularpotentialenergy landscape.Molecularbeam studies
of reactive collisions are used to study the details of collisions that lead
to the exchange of atoms. Surfaces, particularly those of catalysts, are
also open to investigation by using molecular beams.
Molecular Orbital Theory
In molecular orbital theory (MO theory) the electrons are considered to
occupy wavefunctions that spread over the entire molecule. These
one-electron delocalized wavefunctions are the molecular orbitals of
the theory. Two principal approximations are used to construct them.
The first is the Born–Oppenheimer approximation, in which the
nuclei are regarded as stationary in some preselected arrangement.
The second is to use an LCAO procedure to express all the molecular
orbitals as linear combinations of a basis set of atomic orbitals, wi:
c ¼
X
i
ciwi
From a basis of N atomic orbitals, N molecular orbitals can be con-
structed and their energies calculated by manipulating the Schrōdinger
equation. Electrons are then introduced into the available molecular
orbitals by using the building-up principle. The molecular orbital energy
level diagrams for second-period homonuclear diatomic molecules
obtained in this way are shown in Figure M.6. The type of calculation
involved varies from the very primitive (see FEMO, Hückel method, and
semiempirical procedures) to the very sophisticated (see ab initio, self-
consistent field, and density functional procedures).
A characteristic feature of MO theory is that it leads to electron
distributions that can be interpreted as contributing to bonding and

antibonding eﬀects between neighbouring pairs of atoms (and for the
entire molecule for diatomic molecules):
Bonding: A molecular orbital is bonding between neighbours if
there is no internuclear node between them. There is constructive
interference between the atomic orbitals on the two atoms and an
accumulation of electron density in the internuclear region. An
electron that occupies a bonding molecular orbital contributes to
the lowering of energy of the entire molecule. Note that in a poly-
atomic molecule there may be diﬀerent regions where a molecular
orbital may be bonding but in others antibonding.
Nonbonding: A molecular orbital is nonbonding between to atoms
if at least one of the atoms contributes no atomic orbital to the
LCAO.
Antibonding: A molecular orbital is antibonding between neigh-
bours if there is an internuclear node between them. There is de-
structive interference between the atomic orbitals on the two atoms
and a reduction of electron density in the internuclear region. An
electron that occupies an antibonding molecular orbital contributes
to the raising of energy of the entire molecule. Note that in a
polyatomic molecule there may be diﬀerent regions where a mo-
lecular orbital may be bonding but in others antibonding.
The net bonding character of electrons is distributed over the
entire molecule, not localized (as in valence bond theory). Broadly
speaking, the energy of molecular orbitals built from a given basis
increases as the number of internuclear nodes increases. The
lowest energy orbital, the orbital with the strongest bonding

character, has no internuclear nodes; the highest energy orbital,
the most antibonding orbital, typically has an internuclear node
between all neighbouring atoms.
Molecular Potential Energy Curve
A molecular potential energy curve shows how the energy of a diatomic
molecule, disregarding the kinetic energy arising from nuclear mo-
tion, varies as its internuclear distance is changed (Figure M.7). The
minimum of the curve corresponds to the equilibrium bond length
and is closely related to the bond dissociation energy. The second
derivative of the curve evaluated at the minimum gives the force
constant for the bond and is used in the discussion of molecular vi-
bration. The existence of the curve depends on the validity of the
Born–Oppenheimer approximation. The corresponding depiction of a
polyatomic molecule is a molecular potential energy surface.
Molecular Reaction Dynamics
Molecular reaction dynamics is the determination of the trajectory that
interacting molecules take through a potential energy surface, par-
ticularly those corresponding to reactive collisions. In more quantum
mechanical terms, it is the determination of the time-dependent
wavefunctions for the collection of electrons in interacting molecules.
Such studies, and their augmentation by experimental studies using
molecular beams, give highly detailed information about the evo-
lution of reactant molecules into product molecules in the course of a
reactive collision.

Whereas mass is a measure of the resistance of a body to an applied

for rotational motion the moment of inertia is a measure of the re-
sistance of a body to an applied torque, T , in the sense that
do=dt ¼ T =I. The parallel axes theorem asserts that if I is the moment
of inertia around an axis passing through the centre of mass of a body
of mass m, then the moment of inertia, I0, around an axis that is

In group theoretical language, a spherical rotor belongs to a cubic
or icosahedral point group, and a symmetric rotor belongs to a group
having a rotational axis with n 4 2.
Monolayer
A monolayer is a single layer of molecules on a liquid or solid surface.
For the extent of surface coverage see adsorption. A monolayer on a
liquid surface is characterised by the surface pressure, p, the diﬀerence
between the surface tension of the solvent and the solution:
p ¼ g  g
and by the collapse pressure the highest lateral pressure that can be
sustained by the surface film (Figure M.9).
Monte Carlo Method
The Monte Carlo method for producing statistical averages over as-
semblies of particles allows each particle in system to move through
an arbitrary but small distance. Then the total potential energy is
calculated by using an appropriate intermolecular potential. Whether
this new configuration is accepted and included in the computation of
an average property is then judged as follows. If the calculated potential
energy is not greater than before the change, then the new configuration
is accepted. If the potential is energy is greater than before the change,
then it is accepted or rejected with the probability of acceptance pro-
portion to the value of eDVN=kT, where DVN is the change in potential
energy of the N particles in the system. This procedure ensures that the
probability of occurrence of any configuration is proportional to the
Boltzmann factor, eVN=kT. The thermodynamic or structural properties

of the system are then be calculated by averaging the properties over the
configurations generated in this way.
Morse Potential
The Morse potential is two-parameter analytical expression for the
form of the molecular potential energy curve as the displacement, x,
from equilibrium that mirrors its principal features (Figure M.10):
V(x) ¼ hc~De{1  eax}2;
a ¼

The parameter ~De, a wavenumber, is the depth of the minimum of the
curve and meﬀis the eﬀective mass of the oscillator. The solutions of
Schrödinger equation with this potential energy are

Moving Boundary Method
The moving boundary method is a technique for the determination of
transport numbers in which the motion of a boundary between two
ionic solutions having a common ion is observed as current flows. If
MX is the salt of interest, a solution of another salt NX is selected that
gives a denser solution. The MX solution is called the leading solution
and the NX solution is the indicator solution. The leading solution lies
on top of the indicator solution. The boundary between them sweeps
out a volume V in a time Dt when a current I is passed. The transport
number t1 is given by
tþ ¼ zcF
IDt
where z is the charge number of the M cations and c is their molar
concentration.
Multiplicity
The multiplicity of a spectroscopic term 2S11X is the value of 2S þ1
and, provided S is not greater than L, is the number of levels (dis-
tinguished by J in 2S11XJ) of the term. A term with S ¼ 0, denoted 1X, is
called a singlet term. A term with S ¼ 1, denoted 3X, is called a triplet
term and (provided L 40) has three levels.
Multipole
An electric multipole is an array of point charges with an n-pole mo-
ment but no lower moment (Figure M.12). Thus, a single point charge
is a monopole, two equal and opposite charges is a dipole, and four

point charges with zero overall charge and no dipole moment is a
quadrupole. Multipoles may also be formed with more than n charges
provided that they conform to these definitions. Thus, two dipoles
may be arranged to have no net dipole moment but a nonzero
quadrupole moment (CO2 is an example of a molecule with no net
charge, no dipole moment, but a nonzero quadrupole moment).
A point multipole is a multipole in which the separation of the charges
is much smaller than the distance at which their influence is meas-
ured. The potential energy of the interaction of a stationary point
n-pole and a stationary point m-pole separated by r depends on that
distance as
