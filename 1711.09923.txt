Abstract: We present new and explicit formulae for the one-loop integrands of scattering amplitudes
in non-supersymmetric gauge theory and gravity, valid for any number of particles. The results exhibit
the colour-kinematics duality in gauge theory and the double-copy relation to gravity, in a form that
was recently observed in supersymmetric theories. The new formulae are expressed in a particular
representation of the loop integrand, with only one quadratic propagator, which arises naturally from
the framework of the loop-level scattering equations. The starting point in our work are the expressions
based on the scattering equations that were recently derived from ambitwistor string theory. We turn
these expressions into explicit formulae depending only on the loop momentum, the external momenta
and the external polarisations. These formulae are valid in any number of spacetime dimensions for
pure Yang-Mills theory (gluon) and its natural double copy, NS-NS gravity (graviton, dilaton, B-ﬁeld),
and we also present formulae in four spacetime dimensions for pure gravity (graviton). We perform
several tests of our results, such as checking gauge invariance and directly matching our four-particle
formulae to previously known expressions. While these tests would be elaborate in a Feynman-type
representation of the loop integrand, they become straightforward in the representation we use.

Introduction
Recent progress in the study of perturbative scattering amplitudes has often relied on supersymmetry.
While the study of supersymmetric theories has both theoretical and practical motivations, it is
important to know to what extent recent ﬁndings actually rely on supersymmetry, not least in view of
the relevance to present day phenomenology. In this work, we study non-supersymmetric gauge theory
and gravity by employing two remarkable developments in the study of amplitudes: (i) the formalism
of the scattering equations and ambitwistor strings, and (ii) the double-copy relation between gauge
theory and gravity. These closely interconnected structures are easier to study at loop level when
working with supersymmetric theories. They are, however, also expected to hold in the absence of
supersymmetry. This is indeed what we ﬁnd.
Our main outcome is a set of explicit expressions for the n-particle one-loop integrands in non-
supersymmetric gauge theory and gravity.
The formulae are a stepping stone in the application
of ambitwistor strings to practical calculations of scattering amplitudes, including for theories of
phenomenological interest. Moreover, our results have consequences for the understanding of gravity
as the ‘square’ of non-abelian gauge theories.

In its basic structure, the double-copy relation between Yang-Mills theory and gravity remains
intriguing, especially at loop level where it is only a conjecture. The most fruitful tool to understand it
has been the Bern-Carrasco-Johansson (BCJ) duality between colour and kinematics [1, 2]. The colour-
kinematics duality ascertains a hidden symmetry of the gauge-theory S-matrix when expressed as a
sum over cubic Feynman-like diagrams. Speciﬁcally, it states that the kinematic numerators associated
to the diagrams can be chosen to satisfy a Jacobi relation whenever the corresponding colour factors
satisfy that Jacobi identity. This property ensures that gravity amplitudes can be obtained from gauge
theory amplitudes by simply substituting the colour-factor by another copy of the kinematic factor, a
process known as double copy. At tree level, the BCJ double copy is equivalent to the Kawai-Lewellen-
Tye (KLT) relations [3] arising from string theory. String theory provides a beautiful interpretation
of the double copy as relating closed string amplitudes to open string amplitudes; where gravitons,
as massless vibrations of closed strings, arise from joining the endpoints of a pair of open strings.
In fact, the tree-level BCJ structure has been proven by the same worldsheet monodromy properties
of string theory that underlie the KLT relations [4]; and it has also been proven using modern ﬁeld
theory techniques [5]. There are numerous constructions of tree-level BCJ representations for gauge
theory and gravity, e.g. [6–13]. The double-copy structure also turns out to generalise to a variety
of theories – and relations between them – ranging from open string theory to eﬀective scalar ﬁeld
theories such as the non-linear sigma model and the Galileon [14–17]. Moreover, it applies beyond
ﬂat-space scattering amplitudes, to perturbative (and in certain cases exact) solutions to the classical
equations of motion, e.g. [18–21], and to scattering on curved backgrounds [22].
At loop level, the straightforward extension of the colour-kinematics duality to the loop integrand
is conjectural [2]. There are many non-trivial examples of supersymmetric amplitudes for which a
BCJ representation exists, to cite a few [2, 23–27], and there are also examples of form factors [28, 29].
In fact, at one loop there is strong evidence that the colour-kinematics duality holds in general, and
that the underlying structure is similar to that at tree level (irrespective of supersymmetry) [30–39],
including the string theory monodromy story [40].
However, there are also obstacles to the colour-kinematics duality at generic loop level. In partic-
ular, it may not be possible to ﬁnd a colour-kinematics satisfying representation if one restricts the
numerators to be local and to satisfy reasonable power counting properties in the loop momenta. The
most notable example of this diﬃculty is the ﬁve-loop four-point amplitude in maximal super-Yang-
Mills theory. The motivation is the construction of its double copy in maximal supergravity, whose
ultraviolet properties – a long standing problem – may oﬀer hints on the all-loop ultraviolet behaviour
of the theory. Recent work [41] has explored the double-copy structure in the absence of numerators
satisfying the Jacobi relations, and this has allowed for the construction of the full loop integrand for
this amplitude [42], although more work is required to extract the ultraviolet behaviour. There are
previous examples of getting around this type of BCJ obstacle by relaxing in some way the Jacobi
relations [43, 44] or the loop power counting [45]. Investigations from the ﬁeld theory limit of string
theory have also identiﬁed obstructions to the naive expectations of the BCJ structure [36, 46].
Given these obstacles and potential solutions, it is important to revisit the workings of the colour-
kinematics duality using a ﬁrst-principles approach. Such an approach is provided by the other main
development that we explore in this work, namely the Cachazo-He-Yuan (CHY) formalism of the scat-
tering equations [47–49] and its worldsheet interpretation in terms of ambitwistor strings, discovered
by Mason and Skinner [22, 50–55]. The latter are quantum ﬁeld theories formulated in a string-like
manner, and they inherit with some modiﬁcations the structures of ordinary string theory that so nat-
urally express the double copy; refs. [56, 57] study the precise connection to string theory. Crucially,
ambitwistor strings provide a loop-level framework which is much easier to work with than the genus
– 2 –

expansion of ordinary string theory. While some ambitwistor string models admit a genus expansion
[58–60], there is a more general formalism of an expansion in the number of nodes of a Riemann sphere,
with the nodes (pairs of identiﬁed points) representing the loop momenta [61–64]. This expansion can
in principle be derived from the genus expansion when the latter exists, and in fact it was discovered
in this way at one loop [61]. For an alternative approach to the loop-level scattering equations, based
on a (hyper)elliptic curve, see [65].
The formulae for amplitudes directly obtained from ambitwistor strings are based on the scattering
equations. At loop level, the formulae give the loop integrand, expressed in a manner analogous to the
tree-level CHY formulae, but now based on the loop-level scattering equations [61–63]. A remarkable
feature of these new loop-level formulae is that the representation of the loop integrand is not of
the Feynman type, with ordinary propagators of the form 1/(ℓ+ K)2. Instead, the framework of
the nodal Riemann sphere gives a propagator structure based mostly on linear propagators, such as
1/(2ℓ· K + K2). This new representation discovered in [61] was explored in several works, including
[62–69]. One conclusion is that this representation is well suited to express loop integrands in terms of
higher-point tree-level amplitudes. We will see in this paper that the contributions to the n-particle
one-loop integrand are a forward limit of contributions to an (n + 2)-particle tree-level amplitude; the
forward limit is the gluing of the 2 extra particles into a loop. This is analogous to the Feynman tree
theorem. Ref. [67] provides the most advanced discussion available at the moment on formal aspects
of the new type of loop integrand representation, and also presents a higher-loop construction (Q-cuts)
in the spirit of the Feynman tree theorem.
Let us now discuss in more detail the relationship between the scattering equations and the double
copy. At tree level, the CHY formulae have been shown to provide an elegant alternative represen-
tation of the BCJ structure; see e.g. [49, 70–74]. In fact, the predecessor to the new developments
of scattering equations and ambitwistor strings, namely Witten’s twistor string theory [75] and the
resulting ‘connected’ formula for amplitudes [76], had already been shown to be closely intertwined
with the BCJ and KLT relations [77, 78]. In recent work, starting from [49], much of the attention has
focused on the remarkable properties of the CHY Pfaﬃan, the crucial building block that is ‘squared’
from gauge theory to gravity. Along this line of work, Ref. [79] by Fu, Du, Huang and Feng is of
particular interest to us. It presents an explicit and straightforward algorithm to write down tree-level
BCJ numerators, based on a decomposition of the CHY Pfaﬃan. Aside from shedding light on the
BCJ struture, it also provides a simple tool for dealing with the CHY amplitude expressions without
explicitly solving the scattering equations.
It is natural then to study the extension of the double-copy structure to one loop using the for-
malism of the scattering equations. Recently, He and Schlotterer [80, 81] have addressed this question
successfully in the case of supersymmetric theories (with various degrees of supersymmetry). They
have found a natural BCJ-type structure at one loop, which relates to the tree-level structure in the
same type of forward limit that we mentioned above. The details diﬀer from the original loop-level BCJ
conjecture [2]. The origin of this distinction is the representation of the loop momentum: the results
obtained in the representation that naturally comes out of the scattering equations are not easily trans-
lated into the standard BCJ numerators associated to Feynman-type propagators. Ref. [81] stopped
short of detailing this structure in the non-supersymmetric case, because the forward-limit procedure
used for the loop integrand is divergent without the cancellations provided by supersymmetry.
In this work, we ﬁnd that the type of BCJ structure described in [80, 81] also exists in the absence
of supersymmetry, if one relaxes certain integrand-level identities to be valid only up to terms that
vanish upon loop integration. While our results also follow from a forward limit, the procedure we
apply works already at the level of the individual numerators, and therefore avoids the usual diverging
– 3 –

propagators.
In particular, we obtain one-loop BCJ numerators directly from the tree-level BCJ
numerators of [79] via
N1-loop(i1, i2, ..., in) =
X
r
Ntree-level(+, i1, i2, ..., in, −) ,
where ± represent the back-to-back loop momentum ±˜ℓ(an on-shell version such that ˜ℓ2 = 0), and
the sum is over the gluon states running in the loop. This relation between tree-level numerators
and one-loop numerators is derived from the equivalent relation between the tree-level CHY Pfaﬃan
introduced in [48] and its one-loop analogue determined in [62] from the ambitwistor string. Our
results, as those of [80, 81], do not directly translate into conclusions for what the BCJ structure
should be in a representation with Feynman-type propagators.
This article exempliﬁes the remarkable properties of the novel type of representation for the
loop integrand. Firstly, we easily extend a technique that was successful at tree level to loop level.
Secondly, the colour-kinematics duality and the double copy are manifest. Thirdly, we are able to
straightforwardly perform explicit tests of our formulae, namely to check gauge invariance and to match
previously known forms of the integrand, both of which require non-trivial procedures in a Feynman-
type representation. The simplicity of these tests follows from the fact that, in the representation we
use, certain integrand-level expressions are trivially recognised to vanish upon loop integration [67].
We write the one-loop contribution to the scattering amplitude in the form
A(1) =
Z dDℓ
ℓ2 I(ℓ) ,
(1.1)
where I depends on the loop momentum but not on ℓ2; we shall discuss this representation in the
review section. Now suppose that
I′(ℓ) = I(ℓ) + ∆I(ℓ) ,
with
∆I(λℓ) = λm ∆I(ℓ) ,
(1.2)
for some integer m. It follows that, in dimensional regularisation,1
Z dDℓ
ℓ2 ∆I(ℓ) = 0
=⇒
I′(ℓ) ≃I(ℓ) ,
(1.3)
where we use the symbol ≃to denote that both I′(ℓ) and I(ℓ) give the same result after loop integra-
tion, and are therefore valid forms of the loop integrand for the amplitude A(1). More generally, this is
also true if ∆I(ℓ) is a (ﬁnite) linear combination of terms with distinct homogeneity degree m. Notice
that the argument still holds in the presence of the iϵ terms that deﬁne the loop integration contour.
Since a ﬁnite rescaling in ℓcould be accompanied by a rescaling of the ϵ’s, the argument above still
applies. We assume explicitly that an iϵ prescription exists for the new type of representation of the
loop integrand. A natural prescription was proposed and checked in simple examples in [67], and it
would be interesting to investigate its origin in the ambitwistor string, but we will not be concerned
with this here.
The paper is organised as follows. We start in section 2 with a review of the BCJ and CHY
structures at tree level and at one loop, including the one-loop CHY-type formulas derived from
ambitwistor strings, which are the main ingredient for our results.
In section 3, we present the
algorithm to obtain one-loop BCJ numerators and give various examples. We describe several tests of

the results for Yang-Mills theory in section 4, while also giving an explicit example of how to construct
the loop integrand from the BCJ numerators. In section 5, we discuss the double copy to gravity,
leading to formulae for both NS-NS gravity and pure gravity. To conclude, we summarise our results
and comment on open questions in section 6.

Review
We start this section with brief reviews of the CHY representation of tree-level scattering amplitudes
and of the BCJ colour-kinematics duality and double copy. The models underlying the simple and
compact CHY formulae for amplitudes – two-dimensional chiral conformal ﬁeld theories, known as
ambitwistor strings [50] – naturally extend the scattering equation formalism to higher loop order. We
review key formulae, as well as the speciﬁc representation of the loop integrand these models result in.
2.1
Tree-level amplitudes and BCJ numerators
The CHY representation of tree-level amplitudes.
The Cachazo-He-Yuan (CHY) represen-
tation [47–49] expresses tree-level scattering amplitudes for n massless particles in D dimensions as
integrals over the moduli space of a punctured Riemann sphere M0,n,

(2.1)
with σi ∈CP1 and σij = σi −σj. The measure dµ0,n is universal to all massless scattering amplitudes
and fully localises the moduli space integral onto the solutions of the so-called scattering equations2
[47, 48]
Ei ≡
X
j̸=i
ki · kj
σij
= 0 .
(2.2)
Both the scattering equations and the (theory-speciﬁc) integrand I transform covariantly under M¨obius
transformations, in such a manner that the amplitude is invariant. Fixing this redundancy introduces
the usual Jacobian and removes three redundant scattering equations (hence the prime in the formula).
This leaves exactly dimC(M0,n) = n −3 constraints, which fully localise the integral.
In all cases of interest studied so far, the CHY integrand I exhibits a double-copy structure,
I = IL IR ,
(2.3)
where the factors IL,R depend explicitly on the marked points σi and on the scattering data, e.g. the
null momenta ki, the polarisation vectors ϵi, or the SU(Nc) colour indices ai.3 A theory is thus speciﬁed
by its building blocks IL and IR. While CHY representations have been given for a wide family of
theories [16, 84], ranging from Einstein-Yang-Mills to eﬀective scalar theories such as Born-Infeld or
the non-linear sigma model, we focus here on the formulae for gravity and Yang-Mills theory:
IYM = ISU(Nc) Ikin ,
Igrav = Ikin eIkin .
(2.4)
2These scattering equations also feature prominently in the high-energy scattering of strings [82]. See also [59] for
more details on the relation to ambitwistor strings and the CHY formulae.
3Notice that the factorisation poles of the amplitudes are due to poles in σij of the integrand I, evaluated on solutions
to the scattering equations; see e.g. [83]. The explicit dependence of I on the Mandelstam variables is polynomial.

(2.6c)
On solutions to the scattering equations (2.2), M has co-rank two,4 and thus Pf (M) = 0. However,
an invariant quantity, the reduced Pfaﬃan Pf ′(M), can be deﬁned by removing any two rows and
columns ˆi and ˆj such that 1 ≤ˆi < ˆj ≤n, leading to Ikin as given in eq. (2.5b).
The dependence of Igrav on two sets of polarisation vectors indicates that the scattering states
have the polarisation tensors εµν
i
= ϵµ
i ˜ϵν
i . The gravity theory described in this way is the theory of
NS-NS gravity (the name is imported from string theory), describing gravitons, dilatons and (2-form)
B-ﬁeld states. At tree level, if the external states are restricted to describing gravitons (an appropriate
symmetric and traceless linear combination of terms ϵµ
i ˜ϵν
i ), then the scattering amplitudes coincide
with those of pure Einstein gravity.
The colour-kinematics duality.
The splitting of the CHY integrands into colour and kinematic
factors in eq. (2.4) is highly suggestive of the Bern-Carrasco-Johansson (BCJ) colour-kinematics duality
for gauge theory and the associated double copy to gravity [1]. To make the connection between the
two more explicit, we should relate the CHY framework to the BCJ Feynman-like diagrams.
Our starting point is an expansion of the Yang-Mills amplitude into cubic diagrams Γα,
A(0)
YM =
X
Γα
cα Nα
Dα
,
(2.7)
where each term contributes with a colour factor cα, a kinematic numerator Nα dependent on the
external momenta and on the gluon polarisations,5 and a product 1/Dα of scalar propagators of the
cubic graph. The colour factors are composed of the structure constants f abc of the Yang-Mills Lie
algebra, and therefore obey Jacobi relations
cα ± cβ ± cγ = 0 ,
(2.8)
for suitable choices of (α, β, γ) and signs. The colour-kinematics duality [1] then ascertains that there
exists a dual set of kinematic numerators Nα satisfying the same relations,
Nα ± Nβ ± Nγ = 0 .
(2.9)
4Its kernel is spanned by the vectors (1, . . . , 1, 0, . . . , 0) and (σ1, . . . , σn, 0, . . . , 0).
5In this paper, we will only consider the scattering of gluons. More generally, we could also consider matter states,
e.g. in supersymmetric gauge theories.
– 6 –

Kinematic numerators satisfying eq. (2.9) whenever the corresponding colour factors satisfy eq. (2.8)
are known as BCJ numerators, and will be the central object of interest throughout this article. An
important point is that this set of numerators is non-unique, i.e. there exist diﬀerent choices giving
the same amplitude. We will see later that this statement also applies at one loop. The loop-level
conjecture of the colour-kinematics duality is the straightforward extension of the statement above, but
applied to the loop integrand expressed in terms of cubic diagrams, where the kinematic numerators
and the propagators depend on the loop momenta [2].
Given a set of BCJ numerators from Yang-Mills theory, a gravity amplitude is obtained straight-
forwardly via the BCJ double copy [1]: we substitute the colour factors in (2.7) by another set of
Yang-Mills numerators,
A(0)
grav =
X
Γα
Nα ˜Nα
Dα
,
˜Nα = Nα(ϵi →˜ϵi) .
(2.10)
The external states in the gravity amplitude have the polarisation tensors εµν
i
= ϵµ
i ˜ϵν
i , exactly as we
discussed before for the corresponding CHY formula.
We can consider the BCJ structure starting from an alternative decomposition of the colour
dependence of the gauge theory amplitude, in terms of colour traces,
A(0)
YM =
X
ρ∈Sn/Zn
AYM(ρ(a1), ..., ρ(an)) tr

T ρ(a1)...T ρ(an)
.
(2.11)
The existence of numerator relations (2.9) is then equivalent to the fact that the partial amplitudes
AYM satisfy the BCJ relations [1],6

In the CHY framework, these relations emerge elegantly as relations among the Parke-Taylor factors

that is, on the support of the scattering equations (2.2). This short and elegant implementation of
the BCJ relations should serve as a ﬁrst indication that the BCJ numerators Nα can also be derived
eﬀectively from the scattering-equations formalism.
The principal idea for deriving numerators satisfying eq. (2.9) from the CHY formulae, following
[79] and building on earlier work [49, 85, 86], is to expand both the Yang-Mills amplitude and the
gravity amplitude in a Dixon-Del Duca-Maltoni (DDM) half-ladder basis [87],

where both the colour factors
c(1, ρ, n) = f a1aρ(2)b1 f b1aρ(3)b2 · · · f bn−3aρ(n−1)an ,
with
[T a, T b] = f abcT c ,
and the kinematic numerators N(1, ρ, n) are associated with cubic diagrams forming a ‘half-ladder’;
see ﬁg. 1. If this can be achieved, the amplitudes satisfy the double-copy structure, since the gravity

amplitude Agrav is constructed from the gauge theory amplitude AYM by replacing the colour factors
c(1, ρ, n) by kinematic numerators N(1, ρ, n). The numerators of DDM half-ladder diagrams are known
as master numerators, since the numerators of any other cubic diagram can be obtained from these
via the Jacobi-type relations (2.9); this mirrors the analogous statement for colour factors, as in ﬁg. 2.
The colour-kinematics duality is thus satisﬁed by construction.

applies to both the colour factors and (by deﬁnition) the BCJ numerators associated to the diagrams.
The challenge is then to decompose the gravity amplitude into Yang-Mills amplitudes (2.14b).
In the CHY language, this can be achieved by rewriting the ‘colour’ (2.5a) and ‘kinematic’ (2.5b)
integrand factors [49],7

Notice that neither the colour factors c(1, ρ, n) nor the kinematic numerators N(1, ρ, n) depend on the
punctures σi. While there exist several distinct choices of numerators achieving this goal, we will focus
our attention on a recent construction of [79]; see also the closely related work [88]. By deﬁnition,
the Pfaﬃan is a product over closed cycles, and this structure can be exploited to ﬁnd a convenient
Ansatz for a recursive expansion. In [79], Fu, Du, Huang and Feng demonstrate beautifully that the
parameters in such an Ansatz are completely ﬁxed by the requirement of gauge invariance, and derive
a surprisingly simple algorithm for all tree-level BCJ numerators.
Instead of reviewing here their
tree-level algorithm, we will describe it in our one-loop construction in section 3.
7The so-called KLT orthogonality guarantees that such an expansion exists, [47, 78]. A prior version of this type of
decomposition, valid for a (pure spinor) supersymmetrised version of the Pfaﬃan, was given in [7].

2.2
One-loop integrands from ambitwistor strings
The existence of the remarkably simple CHY representation of the S-matrix is elegantly explained by
ambitwistor strings [50, 53, 89] – chiral worldsheet models with an auxiliary target space, the space of
complex null geodesics. Ambitwistor string correlation functions give rise to the CHY representation
of scattering amplitudes, and the physical understanding provided by the underlying CFT has been
crucial in extending the scattering equations formalism to loop level [58, 61–63].
In the genus expansion of the ambitwistor string, g-loop amplitudes are represented by integrals
over the moduli space of punctured genus-g Riemann surfaces Mg,n. Specialising to one loop, the
loop integrand8 is thus given by an integral over the punctures, as well as the fundamental domain
of the modular parameter τ of the torus. While conceptually simple, the mathematical framework on
higher genus Riemann surfaces is computationally challenging and obscures the relative simplicity of
the expected loop integrand.
Due to modular invariance, however, the support of the one-loop scattering equations localises
the τ integral on the cusp or non-separating degeneration τ →i∞, [61, 62]. On the resulting nodal
Riemann sphere, one-loop amplitudes take the following form:

In fact, the nodal measure may be written compactly as

˜ℓ2=0 ,
(2.18)
with two additional particles with back-to-back on-shell momenta ±˜ℓ. This on-shell momentum ˜ℓ
relates to the loop momentum ℓas ˜ℓ= ℓ+ η, where η satisﬁes ℓ· η = ki · η = ϵi · η = 0 and
η2 = −ℓ2; so η can be thought of as a higher-dimensional contribution. Therefore, if I(1) depends on
the loop momentum only via ℓ· ki and ℓ· ϵi, we have I(1)(ℓ) = I(1)(˜ℓ). We will see below that this
interpretation in terms of n + 2 on-shell particles has immediate consequences for the representation
of the loop integrand, and plays an important role in the construction of the BCJ numerators.
It is worth highlighting that while the genus-one representation of the amplitude has so far only
been achieved for type II supergravity (sugra) and only in the critical dimension D = 10, the one-loop
formalism based on the nodal Riemann sphere can be applied to a variety of theories in any dimension
D. In fact, this formalism was used in [61] for super-Yang-Mills (sYM) theory and in [62] for gravity

and gauge theory in a variety of dimensions and degrees of supersymmetry, even though a genus-one
ambitwistor string representation is not known (or perhaps even expected to exist) for such theories.
Moreover, there is strong evidence for the validity of its higher-genus extension [63], representing
g-loop amplitudes as integrals over the moduli space of punctured g-nodal Riemann spheres.
Similarly to tree level, there is a factorisation I(1) = I(1)

in the theories of interest that
have been explored so far. The fundamental building blocks for the one-loop integrands of Yang-Mills

where in the second equation we are allowed to drop the q-dependent term in ∆µν, since its contribution
vanishes on the solutions to the scattering equations; see [64]. These substitutions will later allow us
to obtain n-particle one-loop BCJ numerators from (n + 2)-particle tree-level BCJ numerators.

metry, exhibit the double-copy relation:

In the case of NS-NS gravity, we have the graviton, dilaton and B-ﬁeld states running in the loop. If
we want to obtain pure gravity, with only the graviton states in the loop, we must subtract the dilaton
and B-ﬁeld contributions. This is particularly easy in D = 4, since the B-ﬁeld has a single degree of
freedom, the axion, and therefore it suﬃces to subtract the contribution of two scalars running in the
loop,

New representation of the loop integrand.
One feature of this scattering-equations based rep-
resentation particularly worth highlighting is that it gives rise to a non-standard representation of
the loop integrand:10 after carrying out the integration over the moduli space M0,n+2, the integrand
contains poles linear in ℓnot immediately recognisable as the conventional loop propagators (ℓ+ K)2.
However, there is a simple prescription to obtain such a representation from a standard loop
integrand. The method is particularly easy to illustrate for numerators independent of ℓ2 [61]. In that
case, a loop integrand representation Ilin of the type appearing in eq. (2.16) can be derived from a
standard ‘quadratic’ representation Iqdr via repeated partial fraction identities of the form
1

where Da = (ℓ+ Ka)2 and Ka =

and shifts in the loop momentum ℓ→ℓ−Ka (diﬀerently for each term in the partial fraction expansion),
to obtain the overall factor ℓ−2. These partial fraction identities are in fact a special case of a more
widely applicable contour integral argument [67]: to relate the diﬀerent representations for general
numerators11 N(ℓ, ℓ2), we shift the loop momentum in the standard representation Iqdr by ℓ→˜ℓ= ℓ+η
(c.f. eq. (2.22) and eq. (2.18)), where ℓ· η = ki · η = ϵi · η = 0, such that the Lorentz invariants are
unaﬀected except for ℓ2 →ℓ2 + η2 ≡ℓ2 + ζ. The integrand is then naturally written as the residue at
ζ = 0. Applying the Cauchy residue theorem, and shifting individual terms by ℓ→ℓ−Ka as above,
then yields Ilin:

up to terms integrating to zero in dimensional regularisation; hence I does not depend on ℓ2. It is
easy to check that the denominator factors in I take the form 2ℓ· K + K2, where K is a sum of
10In fact, this can already be observed from the general form of the amplitude given in eq. (2.16) and eq. (2.17) by
simply counting powers of the loop-momentum. Since all scattering equations in eq. (2.17) are linear in ℓ, all propagators
will be as well, and the only quadratic power comes from the overall ℓ−2. See [83] at tree level and [62] at one loop for
details on this argument using factorisation.

external momenta. The sum over diﬀerent propagators a on the right-hand side of eq. (2.28) has an
intuitive interpretation as diﬀerent ways of ‘cutting open’ the loop in the diagram, and each term can
be associated to a tree-diagram involving the (on-shell) momentum ˜ℓ; see ﬁg. 3.

Figure 3. Diagrammatic depiction: interpretation of the I representation of loop integrands as (n+2)-particle
tree diagrams.
We discuss an explicit example of the above presciption for changing the representation of the
loop integrand from Iqdr to Ilin in section 4.
While non-standard, this novel representation of the loop integrand has several remarkable prop-
erties, as we will see below in detail:
• First and foremost, it facilitates a straightforward extension of tree-level results to loop-level.
This is particularly evident in the construction of the BCJ numerators below, cf. section 3.2, but
has also been implicitly used above in writing down the integrands (2.25) for Yang-Mills and
gravity.
• Moreover, it manifests symmetry properties that are either obscured or absent in the usual
representation.
In particular, while the construction of local BCJ numerators on quadratic
propagators faces serious obstacles for six external particles at one loop [36, 46], these diﬃculties
are absent in this representation of the integrand; see also [80, 81].
• As a last point, several checks on the amplitude are substantially simpliﬁed in this framework,
and we exploit this in section 4. Recall the discussion below (1.1) about terms in the integrand
that integrate to zero due to scaling with ℓ, and consider also the form of I in (2.28). The
numerators are polynomials in ℓ· ki and ℓ· ϵi, and the linear propagator factors always take the
form 1/(2ℓ·K +K2), where K is a sum of external momenta. Therefore, only terms with at least
one propagator factor for which K2 ̸= 0 can contribute after the loop integration. In particular,
any term for n = 2 and n = 3 must vanish upon integration because the Mandelstam variables
are trivial.
Notice, however, that while it is straightforward to go from the quadratic propagators to the
linear ones in the new representation, as shown in (2.28), the converse is not true. To our knowledge,
there is no general algorithm to go in the opposite direction starting from contributions with linear
propagators.
Refs. [91] have explored the use of the scattering equations formalism to directly produce quadratic
propagators at loop level, at the price of more elaborate CHY-type expressions. It would be interesting
to know whether this idea can be eﬃciently applied to gauge theory and gravity, and whether it has
a simple interpretation from the point of view of ambitwistor strings.

One-loop BCJ numerators
The main advantage of the CHY representation (2.16) and the resulting integrand I lies in its sim-
plicity: eﬀectively, it has the complexity of an (n + 2)-particle on-shell tree-amplitude. This close
similarity makes it possible to easily extend tree-level results to loop level. In this section, we use
this relation to derive an algorithm for all-multiplicity BCJ numerators, building on the corresponding
work at tree level in [79].
3.1
Derivation from ambitwistor strings
Just as at tree level, the BCJ relations embed straightforwardly into the ambitwistor-string setting.
For instance,

as shown in [80]. Since the colour/kinematic duality consistency relations are naturally satisﬁed on
the support of the scattering equations, we can follow the same main idea as at tree-level to derive
the one-loop BCJ numerators.
Our goal is therefore to expand both the Yang-Mills integrand IYM and the gravity integrand
Igrav in a DDM half-ladder basis,
IYM =
X
ρ∈Sn

where the factors IYM(+, ρ, −) are colour-ordered Yang-Mills integrands. Both the colour factors,
c(+, ρ, −) = f a+aρ(1)b1 f b1aρ(2)b2 · · · f bn−1aρ(n)a−δa+a−,
and the kinematic numerators N(+, ρ, −) are associated to half-ladder diagrams with legs + and −
at opposite endpoints; see ﬁg. 4. This expansion naturally manifests the double-copy structure, now

at the level of the one-loop integrand. As at tree level, the kinematic numerators N(+, ρ, −) in (3.2b)
are known as the (one-loop) master numerators, and all numerators for other cubic diagrams follow
from the requirement of colour-kinematic duality (2.9).

Rephrasing the above expansion in terms of the ambitwistor string integrands I(1), eq. (3.2) is

(3.3b)
Crucially, the extension of KLT orthogonality [47, 78] to one loop [80, 81] guarantees that this ex-
pansion of the Pfaﬃan into loop partial integrands exists. However, determining the coeﬃcients N
is far from trivial, since (3.3b) relies on the support of the scattering equations. Diﬀerent strategies
have been used at tree level and at one loop, including the use of cross-rational identities [73], of a
diﬀerential operator for residues [92], and of the forward limit for the CHY-type loop integrand in
supersymmetric theories [81].
The strategy we will implement here is to ﬁrst use the deﬁnition of the (reduced) Pfaﬃan to expand
the gravity loop integrand I(1)
NS-NS into a sum over simpler Pfaﬃans with purely kinematic prefactors.
In turn, the expansion of these Pfaﬃans into pure Yang-Mills integrands is well known, [79], and can
be obtained by expanding recursively and ﬁxing the expansion coeﬃcients by gauge invariance.12
As a starting point, recall the deﬁnition of the (CHY) Pfaﬃan as a sum over permutations13

In an important distinction from eq. (3.4), I now denotes the open cycle determined by the choice of
removed rows and columns ˆi, ˆj in the deﬁnition of the reduced Pfaﬃan (2.5b), and S+−
n+2 indicates that
we are only summing over permutations exchanging + and −or keeping them ﬁxed. A convenient
choice for ˆi and ˆj are the rows and columns associated to the loop momentum ℓ. With ˆi = σ+ and
12At tree-level, the Pfaﬃans obtained in the expansion coincide with the single-trace contribution to the Einstein-
Yang-Mills amplitude. We will see below that a suitable generalisation holds at one loop as well.
13This representation of the CHY Pfaﬃan is easy to derive from the ambitwistor string, where all fermions in the
vertex operators have to be contracted. With two fermions in each vertex operator, the sum over Wick contractions is
equivalent to a sum over all contraction cycles. Using the equivalence between permutations and the product of cycles
corresponding to the orbits of that permutation leads directly to eq. (3.4). Alternatively, eq. (3.4) can be derived directly
from writing the Pfaﬃan as a sum over perfect matchings: since Aij, Bij and Cij all involve factors of 1/σij, perfect
matchings exchanging these terms can be combined into cycles. See e.g. [93] for an explicit discussion at tree level.

(3.9)
A procedure for obtaining these kinematic factors ˜Y¯I has been developed in [79], and we refer the

that the factors ˜Y¯I are extracted from the Pfaﬃan Pf

/σI recursively, and thus depend on an
(arbitrary) reference ordering RO. The set of BCJ numerators is therefore non-unique.
The ﬁnal
amplitudes are of course invariant with respect to this choice.
Since both the one-loop measure (2.18) and the integrand (2.22) structurally resemble (n + 2)-
particle tree-amplitudes, the algorithm for ˜Y¯I generalizes straightforwardly from tree-level to one loop,
and we summarize the procedure in the next subsection 3.2.
3.2
Algorithm for master numerators
We have seen in the last subsection how BCJ master numerators can be derived in the scattering-
equations formalism at one loop. Below, we summarise the resulting algorithm and discuss several
examples. In section 4, we will see an example of how to construct the full loop integrand from the
BCJ numerators.
Following section 3.1, the master numerators are given by half-ladder diagrams, with the loop
momenta ±ℓforming the ‘handles’ of the half-ladder; see ﬁg. 4. They are therefore characterised
unambiguously by a colour ordering
CO = (+ a1a2 ... an −) ,
(3.10)
where a1 is the left-most particle next to +ℓ. As discussed in section 3.1, the kinematic factors ˜Y¯I are
obtained recursively, which corresponds to

(I) Fixing a reference ordering (RO) to be used in the deﬁnition of all numerators, independently
of their colour ordering. For example,
RO = (+ 1 2 ... n −) .
(3.11)
To keep the algorithm and the formulae compact, it will be useful to introduce a notation for ‘particle
i is to the left of particle j in a given colour or reference ordering’. We denote this by i ◁j (CO) and
i ⊣j (RO), respectively; see table 1.
The master numerators (3.9) (and in particular ˜Y¯I) naturally depend on both the colour ordering
and the global choice of reference ordering. This dependence is best expressed in the form of split
orderings, deﬁned to encode the diﬀerence between the two orderings. They can be constructed as
follows:
(II) Decompose the set of all particles into a colour-ordered subset I and its complement ¯I. For ¯I,
then construct all disjoint decompositions into R subsets α(r) satisfying the following criteria:15
(i) ¯I = ∪R
r=1α(r).
(ii) Each subset α(r) respects the colour ordering:
∀i<j α(r)
i
◁α(r)
j
.
(3.12)
(iii) The last elements of the subsets respect the reference ordering. Using again the notation
nI = length(I), and nr = length(α(r)), this can be compactly written as
α(1)
n1 ⊣... ⊣α(t)
nR .
(3.13)
(iv) The last element of the subset is the smallest in the reference ordering. No ordering among
the other elements is assumed; indeed the ordering is ﬁxed by (ii).
∀i α(r)
nr ⊣α(r)
i

SO =

.
(3.15)
As above, it will be convenient to introduce the notation i ≺j to mean ‘particle i is to the left
of particle j in the split ordering’, c.f. table 1.

intuitively as ‘breaking open’ the closed cycles in the deﬁnition of the Pfaﬃan (see eq. (3.8)), and the

Let us now take a closer look at the split ordering featuring so prominently in the algorithm.
As pointed out at the beginning of this section, the split orderings are constructed to encode the
diﬀerence between the two orderings the numerators depend on: the colour ordering CO and the
reference ordering RO. This is best understood in a concrete example: consider the term coming from
¯I = {3, 4} in the four-point master numerators NRO(2134) and NRO(2143). With RO= (+1234−),
and hence 3 ⊣4, the set Split(¯I) of possible decompositions ¯I = ∪rα(r) is
Split(¯I) =
(
{{3}, {4}}
for 3 ◁4 , so NRO(2134) ,
{{3}, {4}} ∪{{4, 3}}
for 4 ◁3 , so NRO(2143) ,
(3.21)
and thus
SO =
(
(+2134−)
for 3 ◁4 ,
(+2134−), (+2143−)
for 4 ◁3 .
(3.22)
We see that if ⊣and ◁agree when restricted to ¯I, there is a unique decomposition of ¯I (with all
subsets containing only a single element, ∀r nr = 1). On the other hand, if ⊣and ◁diﬀer on ¯I,
the decomposition contains subsets α(r) with more than one element (e.g. {4, 3} in eq. (3.22)). In
particular, this observation only depends on whether ⊣and ◁describe diﬀerent ordering relations on
– 17 –

¯I, without reference to I. Indeed, the above example is chosen such that CO ̸= RO for both numerators.
In other words, the set {α(r) | nr > 1} is in one-to-one correspondence with the set of colour-
ordered subsets of the external particles whose ordering diﬀers from the chosen reference ordering RO.
This will be a useful interpretation to keep in mind for the next subsection, where we calculate some
of the master numerators for illustration.
3.3
Examples
The easiest way to approach the rather abstract algorithm given in the last section is to consider
a few examples. Along the way, we will make some useful observations concerning the form of the
numerators. For simplicity, we take
RO = (+1234−)
for the remainder of this section.
The simplest example:
NRO(1234).
Keeping in mind the correspondence between α(r) and
colour-ordered, but not reference-ordered subsets of external particles, it is easy to see why NRO(1234)
constitutes the simplest case: since CO = RO, ⊣and ◁agree when restricted to any ¯I, and thus the
sum over split orderings only involves a single term for any ¯I. We see this explicitly in table 2.

Table 2. Contributions to the master numerator N(1234)(1234).
While we have only listed one example term at any nI for illustration, it is easily checked that the
decomposition into α(r) is unique for the other terms as well. Due to CO = RO, only subsets of length
one satisfy the criteria of (ii) being colour-ordered and (iv) the last element being the smallest in the
reference ordering.
We can already make a useful observation concerning the structure of the master numerators
based on this example: due to tr(Fi) = 0, all terms from a decomposition with nI = 1 (and hence
n¯I = n −1) vanish. This simpliﬁcation occurs for any number of external particles, and for any colour
ordering and reference ordering; we will therefore omit these terms from now on.

A more interesting example: NRO(1243).
Having gained some intuition with the algorithm in
the last example, let us now turn to a more interesting case with CO ̸= RO. For N(1234)(1243), the
algorithm of section 3.2 leads to the terms listed in table 3.

Table 3. Contributions to the master numerator N(1234)(1243).
Consistently with the intuition developed in the last section, we get terms from the decompositions
{{3}, {4}} and {{4, 3}}, since ⊣and ◁describe diﬀerent ordering relations on any ¯I containing both
particles 3 and 4. We notice, moreover, that terms from diﬀerent split orderings of the same ¯I combine
nicely; for example the contribution from ¯I = {4, 3} is

(3.24)
The ﬁrst term on the right-hand side actually looks familiar: we have already encountered it in
N(1243)(1243) (with RO = CO). A similar calculation for ¯I = {1, 2, 4, 3} shows that the two terms
from SO = (+1234−) and SO = (+1243−) combine to the N(1243)(1243)-contribution and terms
proportional to ϵ3 · ϵ4. Combining all terms, the numerator is given by
N(1234)(1243) = N(1243)(1243) −(D −2) ϵ1 · ℓϵ2 · (ℓ+ k1) ϵ3 · ϵ4 k4 · (ℓ−k3)

Remark.
In fact, the observations from the examples above can be extended to any colour ordering
and any number of external particles:
– 19 –

• All terms with nI = 1 in the sum over split orderings vanish due to tr(FI) = 0.
• Given a reference ordering RO and a colour ordering CO, the master numerators take the form
NRO(CO) = NCO(CO) −∆,
(3.26)
where all terms in ∆are proportional to ϵi · ϵj with i ◁j but j ⊣i.16
Proof. Equation (3.26) is easily proven directly from the algorithm as follows. First note that it suﬃces
to consider a single set ¯I on which ◁and ⊣diﬀer, since the simpliﬁcations work term by term in the
expansion I ∪¯I. Moreover, although there is always a contribution coming from the decompositions
where all subsets α(r) have length one, this term does not directly coincide with NCO(CO) due to the
diﬀerent split orderings. To be precise, ∆Z := ZCO
a
−ZRO
a
= P
i|i◁a, a≺i ki is given by the sum over
momenta respecting the colour ordering, i ◁a, but violating the reference ordering, a ≺i. However,
we will see that this is exactly compensated by the split orderings with nr > 1.
By construction, contributions from nr > 1 are of the form ϵanr ·F(anr −1) ·...·Za1 with ai satisﬁng
ai ◁a1, a1 ≺ai for i > 1. We further observe that ZCO

the terms contracting only polarisation vectors to momenta thus add precisely the factors ϵ · ∆Z
required to match to the numerators NCO(CO).
Collecting all terms containing the contractions
among polarisation vectors as ∆then completes the proof of eq. (3.26).
Corollary: All-plus and one-minus.
The above remark leads to an immediate corollary for the
all-plus helicities and one-minus helicities master numerators in four spacetime dimensions. For these
amplitudes, the reference spinors in the polarisation vectors can be chosen such that ϵi · ϵj = 0 ∀i,j;
see eq. (4.11) below. Using eq. (3.26), the numerators simplify to
NRO(CO) = NCO(CO) ,
∀RO ,
(3.27)
that is, the numerators are independent of the choice of reference ordering. This vastly simpliﬁes the
structure of the amplitudes and facilitates the matching to known results, which we will verify in the
next section.

Tests of our Yang-Mills formulae
In this section, we provide several explicit tests of our gauge theory results. The ﬁrst part is dedicated
to tests of our four-gluon scattering formula, whereas the second part is dedicated to the simplest four-
dimensional helicity conﬁgurations: all-plus and one-minus (and analogously, all-minus and one-plus).
4.1
Tests at four points
The four-point colour-ordered one-loop integrand for gluons is given by a combination of box, triangle
and bubble diagram contributions, all deﬁned with respect to the numerators N deﬁned in the previous
section. It reads17

17The explicit average in the sign of ℓin (4.1) is not essential, but leads to convenient cancellations, simplifying
the tests to be described below. For instance, we ﬁnd that the sign average is not needed to check the cyclic relation
IYM(1234) = IYM(2341), but it enforces directly the reﬂection relation IYM(1234) = IYM(4321).

where cyc(1234) denotes the three remaining cyclic permutations. The full (colour-dressed) integrand,
including the double-trace contributions, is obtained from (3.2a), where colour-ordered integrands
IYM(+ρ−) are now denoted as IYM(ρ) for brevity. In the expressions above, we introduced two pieces
of notation. Firstly, we wrote explicitly the loop momentum in the numerators, N(...; ℓ), which will be
helpful later for comparison with a diﬀerent representation. Secondly, we incorporated the BCJ Jacobi
relations by deﬁning the triangle and bubble numerators in terms of the box numerators constructed
in the previous section, e.g.
N([1, 2]34; ℓ) = N(1234; ℓ) −N(2134; ℓ) ,

N([1, 2][3, 4]; ℓ) = N(1234; ℓ) −N(2134; ℓ) −N(1243; ℓ) + N(2143; ℓ) ,

half-ladder numerators at four points.

Figure 5. Graphic depiction of the Jacobi identity giving rise to the triangle numerator in eq. (4.2a).
We performed three basic numerical tests of our formulae, using random kinematic points. The ﬁrst
test is gauge invariance. Working with any particular reference ordering (RO) to deﬁne the numerators,
we ﬁnd numerically that a gauge transformation changes the integrand but not the amplitude:
IYM(1234)

ϵi→ϵi+αiki
≃IYM(1234) .
(4.3)
Explicitly, we check that the diﬀerence between the left-hand and right-hand sides in the expression
above either scales for a rescaling of the loop momentum or is a linear combination of terms that scale;
equivalently, that there is no propagator factor of the type 2ℓ· K + K2 with non-vanishing K2, since
this would ruin the scaling. For the present test, we ﬁnd simply
IYM(1234)

ϵi→ϵi+αiki −IYM(1234)
ℓ→λℓ
−→O(λ0) ,
(4.4)
– 21 –

but in other tests below we may ﬁnd (ﬁnite) linear combinations of terms O(λm) for integer m.
According to the argument around (1.3), this ensures that the two loop integrands are equivalent.
The simplicity of this important test is striking, when compared with the more elaborate procedure
required to verify gauge invariance in a Feynman-type representation of the integrand.
The second test we performed is the veriﬁcation that we obtain an equivalent loop integrand (≃)
for any choice of reference ordering in the deﬁnition of the numerators. For instance,18
IYM(1234)

RO=(1234) ≃IYM(1234)

RO=(4231) .
(4.5)
More generally, we can use any linear combination
N(CO; ℓ) =
X
RO∈S4

c(RO) NRO(CO; ℓ) + ˜c(RO) NRO(ICO; −ℓ)

,
∀CO ∈S4 ,
(4.6)
as long as the constant coeﬃcients satisfy
X
RO∈S4

c(RO) + ˜c(RO)
= 1 .
(4.7)
We denote by ICO the inverted colour ordering; for instance, CO = (1234) ⇒ICO = (4321). The
inclusion of these terms into the numerators in eq. (4.6) is allowed because of the reﬂection property
of the propagators in half-ladder diagrams (which requires momentum conservation), e.g.
(2ℓ· k4)(2ℓ· (k4 + k3) + 2k4 · k3)(−2ℓ· k1)

ℓ→−ℓ= (2ℓ· k1)(2ℓ· (k1 + k2) + 2k1 · k2)(−2ℓ· k4) .
Let us give an explicit example. If we deﬁne the numerators by choosing the linear combination
N(CO; ℓ) = (1 −c) N(2413)(CO; ℓ) + c N(4312)(ICO; −ℓ) ,
∀CO ∈S4 ,
(4.8)
then the terms proportional to the coeﬃcient c in the complete integrant IYM(1234) vanish after loop
integration, due to their scaling with the loop momentum, as discussed above. A natural choice of
numerators is to symmetrise over all reference orderings, as we discuss in appendix B. In this case,
the various colour orderings are obtained from each other by just relabelling the particles.
For the third test, we match our loop integrand (in any of the equivalent forms described above)
with a known form of the four-point integrand. That is, while we have veriﬁed the consistency of our
expressions with respect to gauge transformations and to the choice of reference ordering that deﬁnes
the numerators, we are still to show explicitly that it matches the correct amplitude. In order to do
this, we choose a conventional BCJ representation of the integrand – that is, one with Feynman-type
quadratic propagators – obtained in [35]. In particular, we deﬁne as
ˆN(1234; ℓ; ℓ2)
the box BCJ numerator of equation (3.5) in that paper.
Notice that, in this conventional BCJ
representation, the analogous numerator for any other ordering of the particles is given by a simple
relabelling. Moreover, the numerators ˆN depend on ℓ2 (unlike ours, which depend on ℓonly through
ℓ·ki and ℓ·ϵi) and we denote this dependence explicitly in its arguments. Now, in order to compare to
18We denote the reference ordering (+i1i2i3i4−) simply as (i1i2i3i4) for brevity.

our numerators, we must change from the Feynman-type representation Iqdr of the integrand used in
[35] into the representation Ilin we use. We can follow the procedure reviewed around (2.27) to obtain

The choice of the last argument in the numerators ˆN is associated with the shifts ℓ2 →ℓ2 + η2 for
each term, as explained below (2.27). Finally, we can verify numerically that
ˆIYM(1234) ≃IYM(1234) ,
(4.10)
where our integrand IYM can be given by any reference ordering of the numerators N, or by any valid
linear cobination of these as discussed above.
We conclude that we have the correct four-particle one-loop integrand.
For completeness, we performed one more check: the veriﬁcation of the one-loop BCJ relations.
For the representation of the loop integrand that we use, these relations were given in [80]. We ﬁnd
that the relations (5) and (6) in that paper are still valid, but only up to terms that integrate to zero
due to scaling. This subtlety does not occur for the supersymmetric case studied in [80], but was
anticipated in previous work on the one-loop BCJ relations [30]. Likewise, we ﬁnd that the partial
integrands deﬁned in [80] are now gauge invariant only up to terms that integrate to zero.
4.2
Tests in four dimensions: all-plus and one-minus amplitudes

we have ϵ±

j = 0. As we saw in (3.26), the deﬁnition of the numerators is independent of the choice
of reference orderings when ϵi · ϵj = 0. In the case where all the particles have the same helicity, we
– 23 –

have veriﬁed up to 15 points that
N(1+2+ · · · n+; ℓ) = 2
n
Y
i=1

⟨ηi⟩2 X(ℓ+ k1 + · · · + ki−1, ki) ,
(4.12)
where the factor 2 comes from D −2, and we made use of the object
X(K, K′) ≡−⟨η|KK′|η⟩= −X(K′, K) ,
(4.13)
with the momenta K and K′ possibly oﬀ-shell. These numerators are precisely the BCJ numerators
for all-plus amplitudes found in [33]. The all-plus one-loop amplitudes belong to the self-dual sector
of Yang-Mills theory, where X(K, K′) plays the role of vertex in diagrams. As ﬁrst described in [8],
the colour-kinematics duality in the self-dual sector is a consequence of the (Schouten) identity
X(Ka, Kb) X(Kc, Kd) + X(Kb, Kc) X(Ka, Kd) + X(Kc, Ka) X(Kb, Kd) = 0 ,
(4.14)
which leads to the Jacobi relations among numerators.
The above result can be extended to the case when all but one particles have the same helicity.
Let us take particle 1 to have negative helicity, while the others have positive helicity. We can still
obtain ϵi · ϵj = 0 for any particles i and j, if we choose |η⟩= |1⟩. Then our BCJ-numerator algorithm
leads to the one-minus BCJ numerators also described in [33], for instance,
N(1−2+ · · · n+; ℓ) = 2

⟨ηi⟩2 X(ℓ+ k1 + · · · + ki−1, ki) ,
(4.15)
with ¯X(K, K′) ≡−[η|KK′|η], which we have also checked up to 15 points.
To conclude, the only non-supersymmetric families of amplitudes for which an n-point BCJ form
was known explicitly – the all-plus and one-minus sectors [33] – are precisely reproduced by the general
numerators that we introduce in this paper.
4.3
Comment on representations of the loop integrand
The all-plus and one-minus numerators we have just described are special in that they are valid
both in our representation of the loop integrand and in a conventional representation with quadratic
propagators, where they were originally found in [33]. To appreciate this, consider these two types of
representation at four points, in (4.1) and (4.9), respectively. Our numerators obey
N(1234; ℓ−k1) = N(2341; ℓ)
for all-plus or one-minus helicities,
(4.16)
where the choice of reference ordering is irrelevant. However, in general, the expression above is only
valid for certain distinct reference orderings, such as
N(1234)(1234; ℓ−k1) = N(2341)(2341; ℓ) .
(4.17)
For this reason, it is in general not easy to relate our numerators to a set of numerators in a conven-
tional representation of the integrand with quadratic propagators. We expect that, in a conventional
representation, BCJ numerators should in general depend on ℓ2, as in the four-point numerators ˆN
of [35] used above to test our loop integrand. It would be interesting to ﬁnd a modiﬁcation of our
numerators that applies to a conventional integrand.

4.4
Comment on unitarity cuts
Unitarity based techniques are a powerful tool to deal with loop-level amplitudes [95]. A natural
question is whether our formulae are well suited to the application of these techniques, as an alternative
to direct loop integration. Although this question is beyond the scope of this paper, we can make a
simple remark.
Consider the four-point integrand given above in (4.1). There exist four terms in the box contribu-
tion, whose propagators are cyclically related; the same does not apply in general to the numerators,
as they depend on the choice of reference ordering. However, this complication is ultimately spurious.
A four-dimensional maximal (box) cut is given by, for instance,19
• either NRO(1234; ℓa) , independently of RO, with cut loop momentum solutions ℓa, a = 1, 2,

The result is equivalent. This shows that the potentially unattractive features of the number of terms
in our formulae (e.g. four terms for each box diagram) and of the choice of reference ordering are not
serious obstructions. The procedure above does not require a sum over internal polarisation states,
and its connection to tree-level formulae is manifest from the algorithm for the numerators. We plan
to explore the unitarity properties of our formulae elsewhere.

Double copy to gravity
The gravity loop integrand is obtained from the Yang-Mills case via the double-copy prescription, by
squaring the numerators. The straightforward double copy gives the NS-NS gravity case. For four
external particles, we have
INS-NS,4 = 1

.
This gives the amplitude for the scattering of external states with factorisable polarisation tensors,
εµν = ϵµ˜ϵν. For more general states (where the polarisation tensors are not factorisable but can be
given by linear combinations of factorisable contributions), we take appropriate linear combinations
of the numerators for the factorisable states.
We have performed the analogous numerical tests as for the Yang-Mills four-point amplitude:
• invariance with respect to gauge transformations, now of both ϵ and ˜ϵ;
• equivalence of diﬀerent choices of reference ordering (or valid linear combinations of such choices)
in the deﬁnition of the numerators, independently for left and right numerator factors in the
double copy;
19A non-vanishing result requires that there are two particles external of each helicity.

• matching to a known form of the integrand, [35], namely the gravity integrand obtained from
the double copy of (4.9).
In all these cases, the principle of the test is the same: the loop integrand INS-NS,4 is only deﬁned
up to terms that integrate to zero according to their scaling with the loop momentum. Moreover, the
higher-point tests for the four-dimensional all-plus and one-minus helicity amplitudes apply also to
the gravity case.
We have so far discussed the one-loop integrand for NS-NS gravity, where not only the graviton
but also the dilaton and B-ﬁeld run in the loop. Let us now present the one-loop integrand for pure
gravity, with only gravitons in the loop. This can be performed by an explicit subtraction of the
unwanted degrees of freedom. Recall from (2.25) the form of the loop integrand in terms of one-loop
scattering equations,
INS-NS =
Z
M0,n+2
dµ(nod)
1,n
I(1)
NS-NS ,
I(1)
NS-NS = I(1)
NS eI(1)

(5.2)
While we did not write it in this way previously, we can use the decomposition
I(1)
NS =
1
(σ+−)2
 (D −2) Pf(M3) + Pf√q(M3)

,
(5.3)
where the deﬁnition of Pf√q(M3), which is not important for our current purpose, can be found in [61]
or [62]. What matters to us now is that the ﬁrst contribution on the right-hand side is the coeﬃcient
of D −2, and the other contribution is the rest. Then we can write
I(1)
NS-NS = I(1)
NS eI(1)

(5.4)
We mentioned in (2.26) that, for pure gravity in D = 4, we need to subtract the dilaton and the axion:
I(1)
4D-pure-grav = I(1)

.
(5.5)
Since our numerators for NS-NS gravity follow from the expression for I(1)
NS-NS, it is clear how to modify
them in order to subtract the unwanted states: we should modify the coeﬃcient of (D −2)2,
N4D-pure-grav = N({ϵi, ki}; ℓ) N({˜ϵi, ki}; ℓ)

(D−2)2 →(D−2)2−2
and set
D = 4 .
(5.6)
Since graviton external states are in general non-factorisable (i.e. not of the form εµν = ϵµϵν), an
appropriate symmetric linear combination of numerators for factorisable states ϵµ˜ϵν is required. This
is not necessary in a four-dimensional helicity basis, where the two helicity states of the graviton have
the factorisable form ε±
µν = ϵ±
µ ϵ±
ν .
The pure gravity numerators obtained in this way also satisfy the previous tests of gauge invariance,
independence with respect to reference ordering, and correct higher-point all-plus and one-minus
helicity amplitudes.

Discussion
We have presented explicit formulae for the one-loop integrands in non-supersymmetric Yang-Mills
theory and gravity. The type of integrand representation employed, which diﬀers from a Feynman-like
representation with quadratic propagators, has allowed us to extend tree-level results to loop level,
and also to check our expressions in a straightforward manner.
These results exhibit the potential of ambitwistor strings as a tool in quantum ﬁeld theory, includ-
ing the study of non-supersymmetric theories. One major question that we discussed in detail is the
BCJ colour-kinematics duality in gauge theory and the associated double copy to gravity. We found
that the one-loop results for supersymmetric theories [80, 81] extend to the non-supersymmetric case,
if one takes into account the fact that the loop integrand is not uniquely deﬁned due to terms that
vanish upon loop integration. These results indicate that the loop-level BCJ conjecture [2], formulated
for a Feynman-type representation of the integrand, is more restrictive than its analogue conjecture
for the new type of integrand representation. This is a signiﬁcant ﬁnding in view of the obstacles
that have been found when exploring the colour-kinematics duality at loop level, as discussed in the
Introduction.
An important open question is how to perform the loop integration eﬃciently in the representation
of the integrand that we use. There are three obvious approaches. The ﬁrst is to explore the direct loop
integration, based on the iϵ prescription proposed in Ref. [67]. The second is to adapt our algorithm to
produce a Feynman-type representation of the integrand, for which integration techniques have been
developed over decades. The third is to extract information from our formulae in a manner that is
suitable for modern unitarity techniques. In our view, all three approaches are worth exploring, and
indeed each may inform the others.
There are several other lines of work that suggest themselves. One is the application of our results
to infrared physics in gauge theory and gravity, where the scattering equations and ambitwistor strings
have already proven to be fruitful [96] for describing the new soft theorems discovered in [97]. Another
line of work is the study of the four-dimensional ambitwistor strings [51], whose loop-level development
has been initiated in [98] but is still largely an open problem. It would be interesting to ﬁnd explicit
integrand formulae that can in principle be integrated, along the lines of our work.
The most obvious open question is the extension of the entire formalism to higher loops. The ﬁrst
two-loop results were reported in [63] and they will soon be further developed [94].

As discussed in section 3.3, the term proportional to (D −2) in N(1243) for example is calculated as
the sum over the decompositions {{1}, {2}, {3}, {4}} and {{1}, {2}, {4, 3}},

Following the remark in section 3.3, it is much more convenient to calculate the diﬀerence ∆=
NCO(CO) −NRO(CO) of the numerators with the reference ordering RO from the canonical reference

summing over all choices:
