Abstract    
It is shown that investigations in the field of microwave resonance 
stimulation of the acupuncture system, as well as investigations of the 
interactions of consciousness with microscopic and macroscopic 
environment - imply the existence of local and nonlocal macroscopic 
quantum biophysical effects, with great potential implications in 
medicine, 
psychology, 
biology, 
physics, 
engineering, 
and 
philosophy/religion. The parallels between classical and quantum 
Hopfield-like neural networks were also emphasized, as well as 
biophysical quantum-relativistic model of altered and transitional states 
of consciousness, the roots of relative metatheory of consciousness in 
the quantum decoherence theory, and anthropic "coincidences" in 
classical and quantum cosmology.

ne century elapsed from the first discoveries of the quantum aspects of Nature, and 
quantum laws of microworld have got enormous technological applications in 
semiconductor microelectronics and measurements, optoelectronics and laser 
technique, computers and telecommunications, with a tendency of further expansion through 
miniaturization 
of semiconductor 
devices 
till 
nanometer dimensions. Discoveries 
of 
low-temperature and high-temperature semiconductors revealed that quantum effects can be 
macroscopic as well, with possibility of much wider application of quantum technologies, especially 
in electroenergetics and transport, and also in microelectronics and measurements of ultrahigh 
speed and accuracy.

Initially, quantum mechanics appeared as a theory of microscopic physical systems 
(elementary particles, atoms, molecules) and phenomena at small space-time scales; typically, 
quantum phenomena are manifested at dimensions smaller than 1 nm and time intervals shorter 
than 1 µs. However, from the very beginning of the quantum-mechanical founding the question of 
its universality was raised, i.e. the question of general validity of the quantum-physical laws for 
macroscopic phenomena as well, usually treated by the methods of classical physics. In the history 
of quantum physics, and especially quantum mechanics, this question has been temporarily put 
aside for very different reasons, being considered as a difficult scientific problem. The situation is 
additionally complicated by the existence of different schools of quantum mechanics, arguing about 
physical-epistemological status of the so called collapse (reduction) of the wave function. In this 
respect the situation is not much better today, and it can be said freely that the problem of 
universal validity of quantum mechanics is still open.  
Starting from the 1980's, mainly in the papers of Leggett (1980, 1986; Leggett and Garg 
1985; Leggett et al. 1987), a new period in investigation of quantum-mechanical phenomena on the 
macroscopic level began. Namely, a clarification of the notions and planning of experimental 
situations for observing some physical effects started. The central problem in this respect is a 
notion of macroscopic differentiation of the states of quantum system whose quantum-mechanical 
behavior is explored. More precisely, Leggett argues that the term macroscopic 
quantum-mechanical effect must be related to macroscopically different states, i.e. the system 
states (and observables) that carry macroscopic properties (and behaviors) of the system as a 
whole. These states (i.e. observables) must carry classical-physical behavior of the system as well, 
this posing a task for choosing physical conditions giving rise to observation of typical quantum 
effects related to these states1. Therefore a difference between macroscopic quantum phenomena: 
the ones usually explored by the methods of (quantum) statistical physics and not related to 
macroscopically differentiated states (being classified as macroscopic quantum phenomena of the 
first kind), and those ones regarding macroscopically different (differentiated) states (being 
classified as macroscopic quantum phenomena of the second kind, and being interesting to us). 
Numerous different macroscopic quantum phenomena of the second kind, some of them 
belonging to the fast developing field of the quantum computing and information, unequivocally 
sharpen the overall problem of universal validity of quantum mechanics.  
In the context of macroquantum effects in biophysics, investigations at the end of 20th 
century in the field of microwave resonance stimulation of acupuncture system, as well as studies 
of consciousness interactions with microscopic and macroscopic environment - revealed the 
existence of novel local and nonlocal macroscopic quantum biophysical effects, with far reaching 
potential implications in medicine, psychology, biology, physics, engineering, philosophy and 
religion.  
 
    
    
                                                      
1 Paradigm of macroscopic, macroscopically differentiated states, are proper states of position (and impulse) of the 
center of mass of manyparticle system. On the contrary, so called relative coordinates (as observables) neither define 
macroscopically differentiated states nor carry classical behavior of the system, in any known physical theory or 
experimental situation.

Microwave Resonance Therapy (MRT) is a contemporary technology of the acupuncture 
stimulation, which represents a synthesis of the ancient Chinese traditional knowledge in medicine 
(acupuncture) and recent breakthroughs in biophysics: affecting the appropriate acupuncture 
points by the generation of high frequency microwaves (52-78 GHz), remarkable clinical results in 
prevention and therapy of stress, as well as of many psychosomatic disorders were achieved. MRT 
appears under different synonyms: short waves therapy, millimeter therapy, information wave 
therapy ... The method originates from the former Soviet Union, and first investigations in 1960's, 
resulted in construction of the first generation of MRT generators, were not related to their 
medical application but to military industry and satellite communications. Interest for influence of 
electromagnetic (EM) microwave (MW) radiation upon nonhuman biological objects appeared 
shortly afterwards (Zalubovskaya (1970) in Kharkow, Devyatkov et al (1973) in Moscow). 
However, the necessity for application of MRT upon acupuncture points was discovered only in 
the early 1980's in Kiev (Andreyev, Bely, and SitÊko 1982; SitÊko, Andreyev, and Dobronravova 
1988; SitÊko and Gizhko 1991; SitÊko and Mkrtchian 1994) as appearance of sharply-resonant 
characteristic eigenfrequencies of human organism - which successfully stimulated development of 
the second generation of coherent and third generation of noise spectrum MW generators. Sit'ko 
and collaborators presented the MRT officially in 1989 at the international symposium in Kiev, 
where international multidisciplinary expert committee headed by Frohlich announced MRT as a 
perspective approach in the regulation of living systems and MRT clinical results highly efficient, 
and shortly afterwards the MRT was presented and introduced worldwide. 
The quantum-coherent characteristics of MRT therapy should be especially pointed out: 
(1) highly resonant MW sensory response of the disordered organism sensitive to small changes in 
the frequency (0.01-0.1%) of the manually adapting coherent MRT devices; (2) biologically efficient 
nontermal MW radiation of the extremely low intensity (up to 10-9 W/cm2) and energy (up to 
10-4 eV); and (3) neglecting MW energy losses alongside acupuncture meridians (~ 1 m). On the 
basis of these empirical data, Sit'ko and collaborators has proposed that acupuncture system is a 
macroscopic quantum dynamic structure (Andreyev, Bely, and SitÊko 1982; SitÊko and Mkrtchian 
1994) which might simply be visualized (Jovanovicć-Ignjaticć and Rakovicć 1999; Rakovicć et al. 
2000) as differentiated at the locations of maxima of three-dimensional standing waves, formed as 
a result of the reflection of coherent MW Frohlich excitations of molecular subunits in the cell 
membranes, proteins, microtubules etc. (Frohlich 1968, 1991). This is supported also by other 
investigations which have demonstrated that differentiation of gap junctions (GJ) channels (of 
higher density at acupuncture points; see Li, Mashansky, and Mirkin 1989) - as evolutionary older 
type of intercell communication, which transmits metabolits and regulatory molecules between 
nonexcitable 
cells, 
and 
ionic 
electric 
signals 
(presumably 
by 
combined 
classical-ionic/quantum-solitonic mechanisms; Keković et al. 2004) between excitable cells (of the 
cardiac muscle, smooth muscles, epithelial liver cells, neurons with electrical synapses, and 
acupuncture points and meridians) - might be slightly sensitive to voltage (Kandel, Siegelbaum, and 
Schwartz 1991; Benett et al. 1991). 
In that context the explanation for efficiency of the MRT, as noninvasive 
nonmedicamentous medical treatment, should be sought (Jovanovicć-Ignjaticć and Rakovicć 1999; 
Rakovicć et al. 2000): some disorders in the organism give rise to deformation in the standing wave

structure of electrical field of the organism in MW region, which influences corresponding changes 
in spatial structure of the acupuncture system, and consequently its resonant frequencies, resulting 
in some disease. During the therapy, applying the MW sound at corresponding acupuncture points 
the excited acupuncture system of the patient is relaxing to the previous healthy condition, while 
reaching the normal resonant frequencies responses upon the wide spectrum MW source - and 
following to physiological mechanisms of the acupuncture regulation (Škokljev 1976; Portnov 1982; 
Omura 1982; Xinnong 1987) the organism biochemically overcomes the disease. 
The quantum-coherent characteristics of MRT therapy suggest that healthy condition 
might be considered as an absolute minimum (ground state) of Sit'ko nonlocal selfconsistent 
macroscopic quantum potential of the organism, while some disorders of an acupuncture system 
correspond to higher minima of the (spatio-temporally changeable) potential hypersurface in 
energy-configuration space - this being possible explanation of higher MRT sensory responses of 
the more excited (more disordered) acupuncture system, and poor MRT sensory response of the 
healthy acupuncture system being already in the ground state (Jovanovicć-Ignjaticć and Rakovicć 
1999; Rakovicć et al. 2000). Such a picture is very close to those of associative neural networks in 
their energy-configuration spaces, and pattern recognition as a convergence of the network 
towards corresponding bottom of the potential hypersurface, as a memory attractor of the neural 
network (Hopfield 1982; Peruš 1996; Peruš and Dey 2000). Thus, the process of psychosomatic 
disorder might be considered as writing and deepening of the corresponding memory attractor, 
while the process of MRT therapy might be considered as a subsequent removing of the memory 
attractor of corresponding psychosomatic disorder - implying that process of the MRT therapy 
could be most deeply visualized as removal of the very information on corresponding 
psychosomatic disease (Jovanovic-Ignjatic and Rakovicć 1999; Rakovicć et al. 2000), cf. Fig 1.

the acupuncture energy-state space (E, φ): 0 - basin of attraction of the ground (healthy) state φ0; 1 and 2 - basins of 
attraction of the two excited (psychosomatically disordered) states φ1 and φ2 (hundreds of them being in general). It 
should be poined out that energy surface changes gradually during the MRT treatment, by decreasing the potential 
barriers ∆E1 and ∆E2 (and corresponding MRT sensory responses) of the potential wells 1 or 2, to be overcome in 
traversing to the 0 basin of attraction of the ground (healthy) state, when organism gradually recovers by further 
spontaneous approaching the healthy state φ0 (with poor MRT sensory response, as already being in the ground-state). 
Such a picture is very close to the associative neural networks ones in their energy-configuration spaces, and to pattern 
recognition as convergence of the neural networks to the bottoms of the potential hypersurfaces, being the attractors of 
neural networks memory patterns φ0, φ1, φ2.

Such a similarity between the two approaches is presumably not a coincidence, as (real) 
mathematical formalism of the model of HopfieldÊs associative neural network (Hopfield 1982) is 
analogous (Peruš 1996; Peruš and Dey 2000) to (complex) mathematical formalism of FeynmanÊs 
propagator version of the Schrodinger equation (Feynman and Hibbs 1965; Bjorken and Drell 
1964), cf. Appendix I. This also supports the EM/ionic MW/ULF quantum-holographic function of 
the acupuncture system (like complex oscillatory holographic Hopfield-like neural network; see 
Peruš 1996; Peruš and Dey 2000), and its essential relation to (complex-valued quantum 
relativistic) consciousness, as strongly suggested from modeling of altered and transitional states of 
consciousness (Jovanovic-Ignjatic and Rakovicć 1999; Rakovicć et al. 2000; Rakovicć 1994, 1995, 
1997, 2000), cf. Appendix II (it should be added that the displaced part of ionic acupuncture 
structure in these states would have a function of an "optical" MW sensor, which can extrasensory 
perceive an environment, as reported by patients reanimated from clinical death; see Evans Wentz 
1968; Monroe 1971; Moody 1975; Nikčević et al. 1995). An additional support that acupuncture 
system is really related to consciousness is provided by novel meridian (psychoenergetic) therapies 
(with very fast removing of persistent phobias, alergies and other psychosomatic disorders; see 
Callahan and Callahan 1996; Callahan 2001; Mihajlović Slavinski 2000), whose simultaneous effects 
of visualization and tapping/touching acupuncture points might be interpreted as a „smearing‰ of 
memory attractors of the psychosomatic disorders; Callahan and Callahan 1996; Callahan 2001), 
through successive imposing new boundary conditions in the acupuncture energy-state space 
during visualizations of the psychosomatic problems (Rakovicć and Mihajlovic Slavinski 2004). 
So, it can be said that beside brain's hierarchical electrochemical neural network there 
exists 
acupuncture 
electromagnetic/ionic 
microwave 
ultralowfrequency-modulated 
quantum-holographic electrooptical neural network, with brainwaves being both the interface 
between them and ULF modulating factor of MW acupuncture network, implying also biophysical 
basis of psychosomatic disorders i.e. influence of psyche on the body; at the same time this 
presents explanation for the sensitivity of the organism on the influences of extremely weak 
external MW/ULF EM fields (Adey 1980), through MW/ULF EM induction within EM/ionic 
circulatory acupuncture system, thus modulating acupuncture currents by external EM fields, 
without any limitations by threshold potentials which do not even exist within gap junction 
electrical synapses of the acupuncture system. 
Such brain/brainwaves/acupuncture system interface is continuously rewriting information 
from brain hierarchical neural network into acupuncture system, they being there superposed 
keeping their quantum coherence of the parallel processed subliminal ULF lower-frequency 
unconscious information within acupuncture EM/ionic MW ULF-modulated quantum-holographic 
neural network (Rakovicć 1994). The process of collapse of the wave function of macroscopic 
state of the acupuncture system, i.e. final quantum decoherence within the brain, might proceed 
through the same interface acupuncture system/brainwaves/brain. This is presumably realized 
through the brain's frontolimbic process (Baars 1988) of the selection and amplification of the one 
out of many parallel processed subliminal ULF lower-frequency unconscious information (within 
the acupuncture system) toward ULF higher-frequency conscious thought in normal states of 
consciousness (within the brain), being subsequently rewritten into acupuncture system through 
the interface brain/brainwaves/acupuncture system, thus becoming amplified ULF higher-frequency 
normal conscious content (Rakovicć et al. 2000; Rakovicć 1994, 1995, 1997, 2000).

Consciousness is one of the oldest scientific problems, recognized already in ancient times, both in 
the civilizations of East and West. Although consciousness has been the central theme of 
philosophical essays for a long time from the very beginning of philosophical thought, or traditional 
esoteric practices of the East and West which have reached significant level in control of altered 
states of consciousness with significant philosophical and religious implications - the first scientific 
attempts to enlighten the phenomenon of consciousness appeared only in psychology of the 
second half of 19th century (through development of psychophysics and theories of personality), 
physics of the beginning of 20th century (through development of quantum mechanics and 
articulation of the problem of the so called wave function collapse, and the role of observer in this 
process), and computer sciences of the second part of 20th century (through development of 
artificial intelligence and the conception that the whole cognitive process can be reduced to a 
computer algorithm). However, due to scientific methodological difficulties the problem of 
consciousness has not gotten adequate treatment afterwards (corresponding multidisciplinary 
surveys on the problem of consciousness can be found in monographs of Baars (1988), Popper and 
Eccles (1977), Crick (1994), Penrose (1989, 1994, 1997), Tart (1972), as well as in our proceedings 
(Rakovicć and Koruga 1996; Rakić et al. 1996)). Nevertheless, scientific investigation of 
consciousness underwent great renaissance in the last decade of 20th century, with a tendency to 
become the most significant scientific problem in a near future, being absolutely deserved owing to 
its unparallel potential implications in many fields (medicine, psychology, biology, physics, 
engineering, philosophy and religion), as recapitulated in the conclusion of the paper. 
Holistic manifestations of consciousness, like altered and transitional states of 
consciousness (Rakovicć et al. 2000; Rakovicć 1994, 1995, 1997, 2000), conscious/unconscious 
transitions, consciousness pervading body, and free will (Shimony 1995), as well as nonlocallity of 
quantum mechanics demonstrated by Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen effect (Einstein, Podolsky, and 
Rosen 1935) and Bell inequalities multiply confirmed experimentally last years (Bell 1987; Aspect, 
Dalibard, and Roger 1982; Tittel et al. 1998), imply that some manifestations of consciousness 
must have deeper quantum origin (in spite of recent TegmarkÊs (2000) theoretical investigations 
which demonstrate that interactions with environment destroy in less than 10-13 s macroscopic 
quantum coherence within the brain, whose electrochemical neural networks might 
correspondingly be sufficient for modeling normal states of consciousness (Popper and Eccles 
1977; Baars 1988; Crick 1994) - but not altered and transitional states of consciousness as well 
(Tart 1972; Rakovicć and Koruga 1996; Rakić et al. 1996), whose nonlocal properties might be 
understood better through quantum-relativistic manifestations of the acupuncture EM/ionic 
microwave ultralowfrequency-modulated quantum-holographic neural networks (Rakovicć 1994, 
1995, 1997, 2000), cf. Appendix II). 
There are numerous macroquantum models of consciousness (some of them cited in 
Tegmark (2000), whose aim is to investigate existence of the relevant brain/body degrees of 
freedom isolated enough to preserve their quantum coherence), and it is difficult to pretend on 
complete survey of these attempts. Therefore, in this paper we shall restrict ourselves on the 
approach and critique of the Copenhagen and von Neumann interpretations of quantum 
mechanics, and those attempts including ours to resolve manifestly open quantummechanical 
problems in the context of consciousness: (1) physical nature of the wave function nonlinear

collapse; (2) physical nature of the instantaneous action on distance of the wave function nonlocal 
collapse; and (3) existence of the relevant acupuncture macroscopic quantum degrees of freedom 
within the body (related to altered and transitional states of consciousness) isolated enough to 
preserve their quantum coherence. 
The first attempts to treat consciousness strictly quantummechanically originate from von 
Neumann (1955), being supported by Wigner (1967) and lately by Stapp (1993, 2001): in contrast 
to Copenhagen interpretation of Bohr, Dirac, and Heisenberg (Bohr 1935; Dirac 1928; Heisenberg 
1958), which insists on positivistic limitations of quantum theory only on the observer knowledge 
about quantum system (thus becoming essentially subjective and epistemologic theory, as the only 
reality of this theory is 'our knowledge') - von NeumannÊs theory offers ontologically objective 
description of the reality and thus quantum framework for cosmological and biological evolution, 
including consciousness itself. 
Besides, in the problem of quantum measurement i.e. collapse of the initial state of the 
quantum system in one of the possible probabilistic states of the system (when (linear) 
Schrodinger equation is a priori suspended and its boundary conditions are replaced by those 
corresponding to the collapsed state of the quantum system), in contrast to Copenhagen 
interpretation which treats it (quantum inconsistently) as an ad hoc process in the interaction of 
quantum system with classical measuring device - von NeumannÊs theory treats the measuring 
device quantum consistently by postponing the collapse of the initial quantum state until the final 
interaction with observer's consciousness in the chain quantum system/measuring device/observer, 
but also not explaining (nonlinear) nature of the collapse, with additional problem that ontological 
nonlocality of the collapse requests (relativistically inconsistent) instantaneous action on distance 
along space-like surfaces (which is the problem also implicitly transferred in the relativistic 
quantum field theory in spite of the relativistic invariance of the Tomonaga-Schwinger space-like 
surfaces; see Stapp 2001)! 
It is obvious that in von Neumann's ontological quantum theory, which consistently 
introduces phenomenon of consciousness, two open problems still exist: physical nature of the 
(nonlinear) collapse and instantaneous action on distance of the (nonlocal) collapse.  
One possible solution of the problem of (nonlinear) collapse is proposed by Penrose 
(1989, 1994) in gravitationally induced reduction of the wave function, in which the gravitational 
field of measuring device included in the superposition of corresponding possible probabilistic 
states of the device implies the superposition of different space-time geometries, and when the 
geometries become sufficiently different (on the Planck-Wheeler scale ~ 10-35 m) this implies the 
break of standard quantum superposition of the state quantum system/measuring device 
(ill-defined in strictly separate space-time geometries) and Nature must choose between one of 
them and actually affects objective reduction of the wave function. (While regarding 
nonalgorithmic quantum-gravitational aspects of consciousness, Penrose tried to search for 
sufficiently isolated relevant macroscopic quantum degrees of freedom in microtubular citoskeletal 
structures of neurons (but not of acupuncture system!), which was undergone to severe critiques 
in Tegmark's (2000) paper.) 
According to Rakovicć's biophysical quantum-relativistic model of consciousness (Rakovicć 
1995, 1997, 2000; cf. Appendix II), the similar objective reduction of the wave function might have 
quantum-gravitational origin in space-time microscopic wormhole tunnels of highly noninertial 
microparticle interactions in quantum measurement-like situations (fully equivalent, according to

Einstein's principle of equivalence, to strong gravitational fields - in which opening of wormholes is 
predicted; see Morris, Thorne, and Yurtsever 1988; Visser 1991; Thorne 1994, and references 
therein). The question how it is possible that these highly noninertial microparticle processes with 
inevitable relativistic generation of microparticles' wormholes were not taken into account within 
quantum mechanics which is yet extremely accurate theory(?) - might be answered as they 
were(!), but implicitly within the ad hoc von Neumann's projection postulate (von Neumann 1955) 
to account for quantum mechanical "wave packet collapse" in quantum measurement situations 
(implying also that von Neumann's ad hoc projection postulate is based on quantum gravitational 
phenomena, being on deeper physical level than nonrelativistic quantum mechanical ones!). On the 
other hand, nonlocality of collective consciousness (Rakovicć 1994, 1997), as a giant space-time 
associative neural network with distributed individual consciousnesses (related to bodily 
acupuncture EM/ionic microwave ultralowfrequently-modulated quantum-holographic neural 
networks (Jovanovicć-Ignjaticć and Rakovicć 1999; Rakovicć et al. 2000), mutually interacting 
quantum-gravitationally in transitional states of individual consciousnesses (Rakovicć 1994, 1997, 
2000)),

experiments 
of 
consciousness/machine interactions (Jahn and Dunne 1988), nonlocal Ditron's experiments of 
consciousness/nonliving & living systems' interactions (Tiller, Dibble, and Kohane 1999), nonlocal 
Novosibirsk's experiments of consciousness/living & nonliving systems' interactions (Kaznacheev 
and Trofimov 1992), as well as with nonlocal clinical Duke's experiments on prayer-accelerated 
post-surgical patients' recovery! 
That quantum mechanically consistent approach to consciousness could really imply 
nonlocal properties of consciousness, might be supported by our considerations from two 
additional directions (Dugicć, Rakovicć, and ĆCirkovicć 2000; Dugicć, ĆCirkovicć and Rakovicć 2002): 
decoherence theory and cosmology.  
Theory of decoherence seeks for physically consistent transition from quantum 
probabilistic indeterminism to classical reality, in the framework of quantum theory of 
measurement (Zurek 1991; Omnes 1994; Giulini et al. 1996), by treating a quantum system as 
open (but with assumption of universality of the linear Schrodinger equation, the problem of 
"wave packet collapse" remains unresolved within this approach too; see Rakovicć and Dugicć 
2002). Dugicć recently demonstrated the existence of necessary conditions for decoherence 
process (Dugicć 1996, 1997a,b), giving rise in macroscopic context to wider physical picture which 
naturally encounters consciousness (cf. Appendix III): namely, defining of the open quantum system 
(S) and its environment (E) which macroscopically includes consciousness as well, is the 
simultaneous process - so that different macroscopic parts of the Universe as the open quantum 
system (S) are defined simultaneously with its macroscopic environment (E) which includes 
complementary consciousness (i.e. different macroscopic parts of the observed Universe define 
different complementary observing consciousness). In this way, within the context of universality 
of quantum mechanics consciousness is only relative concept, nonlocally defined with all distant 
parts of the existing observed Universe (although the reverse also holds true!).  
This relative metatheory of consciousness is a part of psycho-physical parallelism which 
emphasizes holistic aspect of the whole Universe and naturally includes consciousness as its part 
(Wilber 1980; Rakovicć and Koruga 1995; Hagelin 1987; Barrow and Tipler 1986). In their lucid

and instructive analysis of the collapse problem in quantum mechanics, Barrow and Tipler (1986) 
offer, apart from unattractive solipsism and Everett's "no collapse" theory (with bizarre branching 
of the system and environment into many copies with different states, continuing their 
independent existences; see Everett 1957), another three alternatives: either any being with 
consciousness can collapse the wave packet by observations, or a "community" of such beings can 
collectively collapse it, or there is some sort of "ultimate Observer" who is responsible for the 
collapse - the last two alternatives being natural candidates for incorporation within our relative 
metatheory of consciousness, thus supporting nonlocallity of (collective) consciousness. Such a 
viewpoint that macroscopic parts of the Universe play central role in physical understanding of 
consciousness may not be so surprising, especially if one takes seriously numerous anthropic 
"coincidences" in both classical and quantum cosmology (Barrow and Tipler 1986; Carter 1990), 
with fine-tuning of the model physical parameters in the cosmological initial conditions close to the 
Big Bang singularity in order that life and consciousness be possible, as well as ĆCirkovic's 
arguments on relationship of quantum gravitation and transitional states of consciousness through 
their fundamental non-unitarity (cf. Appendix IV).

It is shown that investigations in the field of microwave resonance stimulation of the acupuncture 
system, as well as the research of consciousness interaction with microscopic and macroscopic 
environment - imply the existence of local and nonlocal macroscopic quantum biophysical effects, 
with great potential implications in many fields:  
(1) medicine (brain/consciousness relationship; brainwaves and brain functioning; 
acupuncture system and cognitive aspects of altered states of consciousness; relationship of 
nervous system and acupuncture system, and morphogenesis and psychosomatic disorders; local 
quantum holistic aspects of psychosomatics and wider application of the corresponding microwave 
resonance therapy on the level of acupuncture system; nonlocal quantum holistic aspects of 
psychosomatics and wider application of the corresponding transpersonal psychotherapy on the 
level of individual and collective consciousness);  
(2) psychology (mechanism and role of dreaming and meditation, as altered states of 
consciousness, in the integration of personality; mechanism of ascending of unconscious conflict to 
conscious level, and interaction of conscious and unconscious in different psychotherapeutic 
approaches; control of creativity and transpersonal phenomena in transitional states of 
consciousness, and psychotherapeutic implications for transpersonal clinical psychology);  
(3) biology (nonlocal interactions and adaptive mechanisms on the level of species; 
fundamental understanding of the significance of morality within human population);  
(4) physics (fundamental role of individual and collective consciousness in quantum theory 
of measurement; revealing of deep relationship of consciousness, space-time and structure of 
matter, in transitional states of individual and collective consciousness; role of transitional states of 
individual and collective consciousness in controling exits of quantum-gravitational space-time 
tunnels);  
(5) engineering (exploitation of technology of quantum-gravitational tunnels and 
technology of transitional states of consciousness, for radical surpassing of space-time barriers in 
transport and communication; computers with artificial consciousness and creativity, on deeper 
quantum-gravitational principles);

HopfieldÊs classical neural networks (Hopfield 1982) have been extensively studied, simulated and 
used in cognitive neurosciences (Amit 1989; Peruš and Ecimovicč 1998). However, it has also been 
shown recently that HopfieldÊs classical neural network model is mathematically analogous to 
FeynmanÊs propagator version of the quantum theory (Feynman and Hibbs 1965). Hence, in this 
appendix the formal informational parallelism between classical and quantum Hopfield-like neural 
networks will be overviewed.  
In the model of HopfieldÊs classical neural network, emergent collective computation is 
regulated by minimization of the Hamiltonian energy function (Hopfield 1982)

where qi is the actual collective activity of the ith neuron (out of N existing neurons in the 
network), while qik is the contribution of the activity of the neuron i when taking part in encoding 
the kth memory pattern (out of P existing memory patterns in the neural network). The process of 
gradient-descent of this energy function is a result of a web of interactions between the system of 
neurons described by vector qqqq (with elements qi) and the system of synaptic connections, 
described by the memory matrix JJJJ (with elements Jij).

Equation (I.1) is global (variational) description, while system of equations (I.2-3) is local

network. The corresponding neuronal activities can be inserted in the system of neurons qqqq 
iteratively, or can be put in the very beginning simultaneously into the Hebb memory matrix JJJJ 
which contains all synaptic weights Jij.  
Equations (I.2-3) can be rewritten in continuous form incorporating spatio-temporal

From equation (I.6) it is obvious that if the input vector qqqqinininin is most similar to some of the

Haken has shown that introduction of biologically more plausible neuronal oscillatory 
activities gives richer dynamics of the neural network (Haken 1991), with HopfieldÊs classical 
neural net real-valued variables replaced by the complex-valued ones (similarly to quantum 
variables, although in contrast to thus conveniently modified classical formalism, the 
complex-valued quantum formalism is essential). A step further is done with quantum 
generalization of HopfieldÊs neural network: SutherlandÊs holographic neural network (Sutherland 
1990) and, equivalent to it, PerušÊs model of Hopfield-like quantum neural network (Peruš 1996; 
Peruš and Dey 2000). In this appendix we shall review PerušÊs model, based on the direct 
mathematical correspondence between classical neural (left) and quantum variables (right) and 
corresponding Hopfield-like classical and quantum equations, respectively:

The equations in pairs are mathematically equivalent, implying similar collective dynamics 
of the neural and quantum systems, in spite of different nature of the set of neurons (qqqq) and their 
memory synaptic connections (JJJJ) in the neural network, on the one hand, and wave functions (φ ) 
and their propagator connections (G) in the quantum system, on the other hand.

From equations (I.9) and (I.9') it is obvious that if the input wave function φ in is most 
similar to some of the previously memorized wave function, say φ 1 (and simultaneously almost 
orthogonal to all other memory eigen wave functions φ k, k Æ 1), then the output wave function 
φ out converges to the memory pattern-qua-attractor φ 1, i.e. Hopfield-like quantum neural 
network associatively recognizes the eigen wave function φ 1. 
Or translated into orthodox language of the quantum physics (Bjorken and Drell 1964), in 
the above example the propagator G represents the projector onto the wave subspace/state φ 1, 
i.e. makes reduction (collapse) of the wave function φ in of the quantum system into the eigen 
state φ 1. Naturally, the collapse of the wave function of the quantum processor (not only of the 
hereby considered associative quantum memory) is also the final phase of the quantum computers 
as a network of quantum neurons (qubits; see Kitaev, ShenÊ and Vyalii 1999; Bennett et al. 1993) - 
as well as the quantum decoherence within the brain (Tegmark 2000), presumably through the 
brain frontolimbic (Baars 1988; Popper and Eccles 1977) process of the selection and amplification 
of the one out of many (parallel processed subliminal ULF lowerfrequancy) unconscious pieces of 
information toward (ULF higherfrequancy) conscious thought in normal states of consciousness 
(Rakovicć 2001). 
Hopfield-like quantum neural networks are better then the classical ones because of the 
quantum phase differences which improve classical Hebbian amplitude coding (Amit 1989; Peruš 
and Ecimovicč 1998). Namely, by insertion of the eigen wave functions φ k in the form of 
modulated plane waves or wavelets (Peruš 1996),

1990). 
The correspondence of the informational-physical laws of neural and quantum physics, 
presented in this appendix, seems to represent only one of illustrations of the deep interrelations 
of the laws of Nature on different levels. It has also been shown recently (Ng 2001) that physical 
laws which describe simple clocks, simple computers, black holes, space-time foam, and 
holographic principle - are interrelated!

ALTERED AND TRANSITIONAL STATES OF CONSCIOUSNESS    
According to Rakovicć's biophysical quantum-relativistic model of altered states of consciousness 
(Rakovicć 1994, 1995, 1997, 2000), dreaming and similar hallucinate states are characteristics of 
the low-dielectric altered states of consciousness, with relativistic mixing of normally conscious 
and unconscious contents and extremely dilated subjective time base. Namely, according to this 
biophysical model, it is postulated that subjective reference system of consciousness is related to 
EM field of the ionic currents in nonhomogeneous parts of the bodily acupuncture ionic 
structures, and from the biophysical analysis of the models it follows that it must be displaced out 
of body in altered states of consciousness! On the other hand, additional macroscopic arguments 
imply that consciousness is related to EM field of the bodily acupuncture EM/ionic microwave 
ultralowfrequency-modulated quantum-holographic neural network, while analogy of the 
mathematical formalisms (Peruš 1997) of the models of HopfieldÊs associative neural network and 
FeynmanÊs propagator version of Schrodinger equation implies that consciousness might be a 
property of the physical field itself - implying that giant nonlocal quantum neural network with 
distributed individual consciousness processing units behaves as a collective consciousness of 
Nature itself, as widely claimed by esoteric/religious traditions (Wilber 1980; Hagelin 1987; Vujicin 
1995; Rakovicć and Koruga 1995). This model might also provide additional route to the 
quantum-gravitational objective wave-packet reduction, and the role of consciousness in this 
process (Penrose 1989; Rakovicć 1994).  
Namely, this might be deeply connected with the role of collective consciousness (as a 
composite quantum state Φ  of all individual consciousness 
k
φ  (

) in quantum theory 
of measurement, where collective consciousness with its self-assembling Φ →→→→

Ψ ) in quantum measurement-like situations. The very physical 
mechanism of the objective reduction in (nonlinear) collapse of the wave packet might have 
quantum-gravitational origin (similar to Penrose's gravitation induced collapse; see Penrose 1989, 
1994, 1997), in the space-time microscopic wormhole tunnels of highly noninertial microparticle's 
interactions in quantum measurement-like situations (fully equivalent to extremely strong 
gravitational fields according to Einstein's principle of equivalence, when relativistic generation of 
wormholes is predicted; Thorne 1994).  
It should be also pointed out that the above collective consciousness' self-assembling 
Φ →→→→
i
Φ  in the quantum theory of measurement (on numerously prepared investigated quantum 
system Ψ ) should be interpreted as purely probabilistic in Penrose's gravitation-induced objective 
reduction of the wave packet (with relative frequency of their appearance given by

in the potential hypersurface (e.g. Peruš and Dey 2000), or equivalently to more probable 
convergence of quantum FeynmanÊs propagator to the state 
k
φ , fixedly determined by the more 
dominant state of individual consciousness), implying that strong preferences in individual futures 
might exist, governed by individual mental loads, as widely claimed in Eastern tradition (e.g. Wilber 
1980), also presumably supported by contemporary mathematical discovery of the hidden Old 
TestamentÊs „Bible code‰2 (Witztum, Rips, and Rosenberg 1994; Drosnin 1997); the same may 
apply to collective futures too, governed by interpersonal mental loads (Rakovicć 1995, 2000). It 
should be also noted that these preferences in individual and collective futures might be 
anticipated in transitional states of consciousness which might be the basis of intuition, 
precognition and deep creative insights (Jahn 1982). What is really anticipated in transitional states 
of consciousness of individual consciousness might be the evolved state of cosmic collective 
consciousness Φ(t) (to which our individual consciousness 
k
φ  has access, being the constituting 
                                                      
2 A popular survey of mathematical discovery of this extraordinary code is given in the book: M. Drosnin, The Bible 
Code (Simon & Schuster, New York, 1997). The fascinating possibility that history of Civilization is preferently coded in 
The Old Testament revealed to Moses on the Mount Sinai 3000 years ago, might be interpreted as a consequence of the 
quantum-holographic nature of the cosmic collective consciousness (God!?) and its every original manifestation (including 
The Old Testament, as well as every individual consciouness) – which still does not mean the strict determinism of the 
History by the existing state of collective consciousness, whose memory attractors could be reprogramed by merciful 
prayer for the others thus removing interpersonal loads of the quantum-holographic neural network of collective 
consciousness – so leaving the room for free will and influence on future preferences.

part of cosmic collective consciousness), which is quantum-mechanically described by deterministic 
unitary evolution governed by Schrodinger equation.  
However, it also seems that (non-Schrodinger governed) nonlocal individual/collective 
consciousness reassembling ( Φ →
i
Φ ) is possible, with direct influence on the collapse of the 
observed system ( Ψ →
i
Ψ ), which is supported by Princeton PEAR human/machine experiments 
(Jahn and Dunne 1988). In these experiments (even distant) human operators have been able 
solely by volition to influence the statistical behaviour of sophisticated machines with (otherwise) 
strictly random outputs, in a statistically repeatable effects (of the order of a few parts in ten 
thousand) - but individually not reproducible at any moment, which is a standard request in 
contemporary scientific experiments! All this can be accounted by intentional transitional 
transpersonal biological (non-Schrodinger governed) quantum-gravitational tunneling of the 
operator's individual consciousness with mental addressing on the machine's content of collective 
consciousness in the operator's transitional states of consciousness (short and therefore not easily 
reproducible (Jahn 1982) highly noninertial processes of the out-of-body space-time 
quantum-gravitational mentally-channeled tunneling of operator's part of the EM/ionic acupuncture 
system (Rakovicć 1994, 1995)), thus channeling intentionally the operator/machine composite state 
of collective consciousness ( Φ →
i
Φ ), and automatically influencing the machine output 
( Ψ →
i
Ψ ) in the non-Schrodinger quantum-gravitationally governed collapse-like process 
( Φ Ψ →
i
Φ
i
Ψ ). As a consequence one could really conjecture that consciousness might be 
essential property of Nature at different structural levels, macroscopic and microscopic, animate 
and inanimate, being presumably related to the unified field itself (Hagelin 1987).  
That such nonlocal (non-Schrödinger governed) individual/collective consciousness 
reassembling (Φ →
i
Φ ) is really possible, can be additionally supported by 1998' Duke feasibility 
study conducted by the Duke University and Durham Veterans Affairs medical centers, in which 
angioplasty patients with acute coronary syndromes who were simultaneously prayed for by seven 
different religious sects around the world did 50 percent to 100 percent better during their 
hospital stay than patients who were not prayed for by these groups! This is in accordance with 
long-lasting empirical evidences of various Eastern and Western esoteric/religious traditions 
(Wilber 1980; Vujicin 1995; Vlahos 1998). It should be added, on this traditional line of evidences, 
that according to the consciousness-related-acupuncture electromagnetic/ionic microwave 
ultralowfrequency-modulated oscillatory holographic Hopfield-like associative neural network, 
esoteric/religious notions such as (Wilber 1980; Vlahos 1998; Rakovicć 2000) psychic body 
(manomaya, lingasarira, manovijnana, ka, psyche, astral body, subtle body, soul, ...) and spiritual 
body (vijnanamaya, suksmasarira, manas, ba, thymos, noetic body, mental body, mind, ...) are 
biophysically inevitably associated with a partly displaceable (from the body, in altered and 
transitional states of consciousness) ionic acupuncture system, and an EM component of ionic 
currents embedded within it, respectively; also, the ionic condensations in the structured 
acupuncture system, with an EM component of ionic currents embedded within it, behave like

distributed centers of consciousness (yogic chakras); finally, the ionic nature of the etheric vitality 
(qi, prana, pneuma, bioenergy, ...) and etheric body (related to nondifferentiated ions, essentially 
important for many biochemical processes within the body), might be noticed.  
Finally, it should be pointed out that theoretical biophysical modeling of cognitive 
processes (Rakovicć 2000, 2002) might have significant psychotherapeutic implications: (1) 
dreaming and meditation (as a prolonged altered state of consciousness) contribute to integration 
of conscious and unconscious contents around healthy associative memory ego-state, which 
results in growth of personality and alleviation of emotional conflicts; (2) autogenic training (as the 
most contemporary method of medical relaxation; see Rakovicć 2001; Schultz 1951; Lindemann 
1976; Cirkovicć 1998) helps contextual messages to be associatively memorized at the 
subconscious level, from where they contribute to softening of undesired psychosomatic reactions 
on everyday stressful situations; however, for persons with strong psychological conflicts the main 
priority is reprogramming of their psychological conflicts and our modeling implies that this is 
possible in one of two possible ways: (3) deep psychotherapeutic practices (psychoanalytic, group, 
humanistic, gestalt, existential, body, transpersonal, expressive, hypno, integrative, experiential, ... 
orientation; see Milenkovic 1997; Jerotic 1998) oriented to recognition of the origin of 
unconscious conflict and its ascending to conscious level, thus diminishing corresponding 
unconscious conflicting associative memory state, which enables further integration of personality 
around healthy associative memory ego-state (Rakovicć 2001, 2002; Poro 1990); (4) transpersonal 
Christian/religious technique (especially of hesychastic prayer; Vlahos 1998; Jerotic 1998) bears 
probably essential transpersonal aspect of psychological conflict and necessity of its simultaneous 
transpersonal reprogramming in all persons involved, contributing to its radical and final 
reprogramming at the level of spatio-temporal associative memory network of collective 
consciousness, which seems to be only possible through the prayer for others in transitional states 
of consciousness of the praying person (Rakovicć 1994, 1997, 2000, 2001).

The process (effect) of decoherence can be qualitatively defined as a physical process "induced" by 
environment E upon the quantum system S, which leads to effective, approximately 
classical-physical behavior of the quantum system. For manyparticle systems, the effect is 
enormously quick (say of the order

 s), and hence it is not surprising that this effect is 
observed only recently, in a very demanding experimental conditions.  
The system S is open quantum system to which unitary (reversible Schredinger) temporal 
evolution cannot be applied. However, for composite system S + E the universal validity of 
quantum mechanics is supposed, i.e. that it evolves in time according to Schredinger equation, with

In a part of the literature the effect of decoherence is proclaimed as a very basis of 
boarder-line between the two quantum mechanical systems - the (open) system and its 
environment - in such a way that if there is no decoherence, then there is no boarder-line 
between the two systems mentioned above. Recent discovery of the existence of necessary 
conditions for decoherence (Dugicć 1996, 1997) implies that quantum mechanics offers much 
more than one can (classically) comprehend and interpret. However, in the context of the above 
interpretation (according to which if there is no decoherence then there is no boarder-line 
between physical systems) the existence of necessary conditions poses the question: what about, 
mathematically possible, no-decoherence situations, when there is no possibility to establish 
boarder-line between the (open) quantum system and its (quantum) environment? At first sight, 
there is nothing to add here. However, it is not so; even more, a new "horizon" in investigation of 
the deeper fundamentals of the process of decoherence is opened, leading basically to some sort 
of metaphysical theory of consciousness. Some of the results will be shortly presented bellow.  
Let the two (quantum) systems, S1 and E1, are given with their "degrees of freedom", 
alongside with their interaction which prevents the process of decoherence. Then the following 
reasoning appears possible and physically justified: let us introduce new coordinates, i.e. define two 
new systems (new system and its environment), S2 and E2, but in such a way that degrees of 
freedom of these systems represent (analytical) functions of degrees of freedom of the both "old" 
ones, S1 and E1, while the same interaction (i.e. the same interaction Hamiltonian), expressed in 
terms of new degrees of freedom, does not prevent decoherence. Then, the decoherence which is 
forbidden in the "old" composite system S1 and E1, now enables establishment of the boarder-line 
in the "new" composite system ("appeared" by redefining degrees of freedom in the same whole, 
S1 + E1 = S2 + E2)! I.e. the condition for decoherence simultaneously defines both the open system 
(S2) and its environment (E2). The "old" system and its environment, according to initial 
presumption, remain indistinguishable.  
These transformations can be formally presented in the following way. Let the open system 
S1 is given with its degrees of freedom and (its canonically conjugated) generalized momenta,

for every variable (degree of freedom and generalized momentum) of the "new" system S2 (and 
(analogously) of its environment E2). The Eq.(III.2) points out the following: the considered 
transformations (for instance, linear) interconnect degrees of freedom and generalized momenta 
of both ("old") system S1 and ("old") environment E1. So, the coordinates of the "new" system S2 
(and, simultaneously, of its environment E2) are functions of the variables of both "old" systems, S1 
and E1. In the quantum mechanical formalism, these transformations bear one very important 
consequence. Namely, in order that measurement of observables of the "old" systems might be 
possible, the measurement of observables of the "new" systems must be possible - simultaneously. 
But, this is not possible due to non-commuting degrees of freedom and momenta (of the "new" 
systems), and hence the transformation (III.2) is qualitatively different from the analogous classical 
transformations: if the interaction Hamiltonian is such that, in respect to degrees of freedom of 
the "new" systems, allows decoherence, then the decoherence concerns "new" systems, while 
(due to no-decoherence in respect to "old" systems) the "old" systems remain undistinguishable. 
Or more precisely: degrees of freedom of the "old" systems (S1,E1) are not defined by the 
condition of decoherence, while because of the uncertainty relations they cannot be measured 
even indirectly by virtue of measurement of observables of the "new" systems (S2, E2). This is the 
essence of the term "undistinguishable" for the "old" systems.  
The generalization of this reasoning on the whole macroscopic systems of the physical 
Universe leads to an interesting conclusion. Namely, in the isolated macroscopic part of the 
Universe (MPU) the local transitions of the type S1 + E1 → S2 + E2 are forbidden, i.e. once 
established boarder-line (criterion for decoherence) cannot be changed locally, neither 
spontaneously nor by any external action. While eventual global transition, regarding MPU as a 
whole, is unobservable. The related physical argument is following: the physical basis of 
consciousness is, by presumption, many particle system which is subsystem of MPU. Hence the 
imagined global transition of the above type simultaneously concerns this physical system too, and 
therefore the basis for observation of the considered global transition disappears. In other words: 
the above mentioned transformations of the degrees of freedom redefine the (open) quantum 
systems, their environments, but also physical basis of consciousness, giving rise that, effectively, 
consciousness becomes a relative notion - defined by degrees of freedom of other systems (and 
their environments). Therefore, the considered global transition defines MPU as a whole, including 
definition of (physical basis) of consciousness. As different definitions of MPU are mutually 
exclusive (at least in the context of existing paradigms), it is possible to talk about relative 
metaphysical theory of consciousness, which bears some sort of (but not in the sense of von 
Neumann's theory) psycho-physical parallelism.

There are at least two aspects of the contemporary physics of black holes and its application in 
cosmology which imply holistic nature of the universe, and have significance for any anthropic way 
of thinking. The first one is related to the fact that black holes, considered as classical objects with 
some quantum properties, have enormous number of degrees of freedom manifested through 
entropy of gravitating matter. This is represented by Bekenstein-Hawking formula (Bekenstein 
1973; Hawking 1975):

where A is the surface of the black hole's event horizon, and the rest are fundamental physical 
constants (k is the Boltcmann constant, c is the velocity of light in vacuum, G is the Newton 
gravitational constant, and ћ is the Planck constant divided by «). It is obvious that the entropy of 
matter inside the event horizon is proportional to the surface of the horizon, while the physical 
problem of the (singular or nonsingular) state of the matter is not important from this point of 
view. In the simplest case of the spherically-symmetric nonrotating and electrically neutral black 
hole, the horizon is the sphere of the surface A = 4«R2, where R is the Schwartzshild (gravitation) 
radius given by R = 2Gm/c2 (where m is the mass of the black hole). In combination with (IV.1) 
this gives

Now it is possible to calculate gravitational entropy of the matter inside our cosmological 
(particle) horizon, if it would collapse in a some way into giant black hole. This would be the state 
of maximal entropy, as the state of the matter within black hole, as shown by Bekenstein, is the 
most probable one from the viewpoint of the gravitational interaction. Any other state, like the 
one observed today with the matter mainly concentrated in galaxies, stars, planets, etc. with a 
small number of black holes, is a priori less probable. It should be noted, on the other hand, in the 
context of contemporary cosmological models, that situation when all the matter was within its 
gravitational radius actually took part in the past: all the matter inside our horizon was in the initial 
singularity of the Big Bang about 13.6 billion years ago.  
By applying the Boltzmann formula S = k lnW, it is possible to estimate the statistical weight 
(W) of the state characterized by the entropy (S) of the present universe (much less than maximal 
entropy from the Eq.(IV.2) estimated by Penrose (1989) as ~ 10123, in the units of the Boltzmann 
constant k). It is already qualitatively obvious that the presence of the logarithm in the Boltzmann 
equation implies that the present state is extremely less probable; its probability (W-1 ) is of the

order exp(-10123)!!! Such a small number cannot be found in any other place in natural sciences. 
Hence this is most spectacular example of the "fine tuning", i.e. anthropic coincidences in 
cosmology. The former originates from the fact, realized by astrophysicists long ago, that very low 
gravitational entropy (sinonimous for relatively high uniformity of the early universe) is necessary 
for creation of the galaxies, which is the condition for existence of biological systems and 
intelligent observers. This conclusion was explicitly formulated by Collins and Hawking (1973) 
even before Bekenstein's papers and sudden increase of interest for the problem of the 
gravitational entropy. 
The second aspect of the physics of black holes, of the great importance for problems of 
consciousness and intelligent observers, is the possibility of essential violation of determinism in 
semiclassical process of the evaporation of black holes (Hawking's process). The hypothesis that 
transitional states of consciousness include inherently indeterministic evolution ("free will") can be 
potentially explained physically as a residuum of deeper physical processes that include 
nonunitarity. Such processes were seriously suggested by now only in the context of quantum 
gravitation, the Hawking process precisely. This argument deserves more detailed consideration, 
as it is less probable that this is merely coincidence. Rather, it presents an indirect support for the 
hypothesis of significant quantum gravitational role in the functioning of consciousness.  
Hawking (1982) was the first to point on the possibility of nonunitary evolution of a physical 
system, as one of possible answers to the problem of the loss of information in the black holes. 
Namely, let us consider pure quantum state |ψ〉 which corresponds to the distribution of matter of 
the mass m which collapses under the influence of self-gravitation. The density matrix of such state 
is given by ρ = |ψ〉 〈ψ|, with vanishing entropy S = - tr ρlnρ. If m is large enough, the matter will 
create the black hole inevitably. Afterwards, the black hole will evaporate slowly through the 
Hawking process, by emitting the black body radiation (which does not carry any nontrivial 
information). The semiclassical procedure used by Hawking in derivation of formula for the 
temperature of black hole will not be applicable when the mass of the evaporating black hole 
approaches to Planck mass, but what will happen with the information about the initial state still 
enclosed within the black hole? This is a puzzle of the loss of information within black holes (cf. for 
instance Giddings 1982).  
The possibility proposed firstly by Hawking is that the black hole simply evaporates 
completely, so that information is lost irreversibly. This might be described as a fundamental 
unpredictability of black holes (and analogously of all other systems dominated by quantum 
gravitation). Although this idea remains as the simplest solution of the puzzle not contradicting any 
natural low, it raised a lot of discussions and controversies, as it necessarily implies fundamental 
non-unitarity of evolution of the complete system universe + black hole. Alternative solutions 
include possibility that information is still evaporated through the higher order corrections or that 
the Hawking evaporation is terminated when the mass of black hole becomes of the order of 
Planck's mass, leaving bellow the stable remnants encoding complete information on the initial 
state. However, these alternative solutions of the puzzle bear their deep problems, so the original 
HawkingÊs idea is still considered as the most acceptable possibility. It should be pointed out that 
this (alongside with the collapse of the wave function) is by now the only phenomenon in the 
physical world where fundamental indeterminism can be manifested. Whether this is really 
manifested can be only confirmed by the future observable (on detection of the evaporating black 
holes) and theoretical (on development of the correct theory of the quantum gravitation, exact on

the Planck scale) works. In the framework of the idea - originating from Penrose - on the role of 
the future quantum theory of gravitation in explaining problem of consciousness, the possible 
causal relation of the indeterminism in consciousness and indeterminism in black holes might be an 
indirect confirmation of the idea that physical correlates of the mental states could be found only 
within some theory surpassing the contemporary physical theories.
