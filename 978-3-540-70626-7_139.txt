Parton Model
O.W. Greenberg
The parton model pictures hadrons as a collection of pointlike quasi-free particles.
The model describes the cross section for high-energy scattering of hadrons with
another particle as an incoherent sum of the cross sections of the pointlike partons
in the hadron with the other particle. The hadronic factors in the cross sections
are parametrized by “structure functions.” The parton model expresses the structure
functions in terms of parton distribution functions that give the longitudinal momen-
tum distribution of the partons in the given hadron. The parton distribution functions
are found from experimental data in a given process and are used in the description
of other processes (Fig. 1).
The prototype process for the parton model is eN →e′X, where e and e′ are
the incident and scattered electron, N is the target nucleon, and X is the set of
ﬁnal state hadrons. The particles in the ﬁnal state X are not measured, so the cross
section is for the sum over all hadronic ﬁnal states, an “inclusive” cross section. This
contrasts with an “exclusive” cross section in which the ﬁnal states are restricted
to a speciﬁc subset. In the prototype process, eN →e′X, the kinematics of the
inclusive scattering depends on the momentum transfer q = k−k′ from the electron
to the hadrons and the invariant mass, W, of the hadronic ﬁnal state, where W2 =
(p+q)2 = M2+2Mν+q2, and M is the mass of the target nucleon or other hadron.
Here k and k′ are the energy-momentum 4-vectors of the incident and scattered
electron, p is the energy-momentum 4-vector of the target hadron, and ν = E −E′
is the energy transfer to the target hadron in its rest frame.
J.D. Bjorken [1] predicted that the hadronic factor in the cross section would
depend only on the ratio x = (−q2)/(2p · q) = (−q2)/(2Mν), rather than on
ν and −q2 separately, on the basis of an algebra of local currents. This prop-
erty, called “scaling,” was expected to hold in the “deep inelastic” limit in which
the energy transfer and momentum transfer are much larger than the target hadron
mass. R.P. Feynman [2] interpreted scaling in terms of constituents of the nucleon
that he called “partons.” Bjorken and E.A. Paschos [3, 4] gave early discussions
of electron-nucleon and neutrino-nucleon scattering in the deep inelastic limit. The

C.G. Callan and D.J. Gross [5] showed that the commutators of the electric cur-
rent give information about the carriers of electric charge. Subsequent data on deep
inelastic scattering showed that the carriers of charge have  spin 1/2 and can be
identiﬁed with quarks,  Color Charge Degree of Freedom in Particle Physics; Mix-
ing and Oscillations of Particles; Particle Physics; QCD; QFT (see [6] for early data
and [7,8] for recent data in the references). Other sum rules together with data show
that the charged partons carry only about 1/2 of the energy-momentum of the nu-
cleon. The other half is carried by gluons and other neutral particles. Several reviews
discuss sum rules below (see A.J. Buras [9], C. Bourrely and J. Soffer [10] and F.
Close [22] in the references).
Surprisingly, scaling sets in at rather low energy and momentum transfer, so-
called “precocious” scaling. [11] The paper of Bloom and Gilman also pointed out
a duality between resonances and smooth scaling behavior which later led to the
dual resonance model and even later to string theory. The partons are identiﬁed with
the “valence” quarks that account for the electric charge, isospin and strangeness
of the hadron, and with “sea” quarks that correspond to extra quark-antiquark pairs
as well as with “gluons,” which are quanta of the color gauge group that mediate
quark interactions and have zero electric charge, isospin and strangeness. S.D. Drell,

D.J. Levy and T.-M. Yan extended the parton model to hadron-hadron scattering and
gave the celebrated Drell-Yan mechanism for the production of lepton pairs (see [12]
in the references for a review).
More detailed processes, such as semi-inclusive processes in which some of the
ﬁnal state hadrons are measured, require parton fragmentation functions [13], as
well as parton distribution functions, for their description. The fragmentation func-
tions account for the conversion of partons into hadrons in the ﬁnal states. Gross
and Wilczek [14] and H. Georgi and Politzer [15] showed that quantum chromo-
dynamics predicts logarithmic corrections to scaling. The DGLAP formalism [16]
expresses these corrections in parton language.
Scattering experiments with polarized beams and targets give information that
cannot be obtained from unpolarized experiments. The EMC experiment with po-
larized muons scattering on polarized protons [17] led to the “spin crisis,” that only
about 1/4 of the spin of the proton is carried by quarks [18] (see reviews in [19]).
Feynman gave arguments that partons don’t interact with each other in ﬁrst ap-
proximation because in the limiting inﬁnite momentum frame there is a separation
of scales between the (slow) parton-parton interactions and the (fast) interaction
with the scattered lepton. [13] The running of coupling constants that follows from
asymptotic freedom  Color Charge Degree of Freedom in Particles Physics; QCD;
QFT provides further understanding of the mystery that quarks are permanently
conﬁned in hadrons viewed at low energy, but are quasi-free viewed as partons at
high energy. [20,21]
R.E. Taylor, H.W. Kendall and J.I. Friedman describe the pathbreaking ex-
perimental discoveries that stimulated the invention of the parton model [6].
