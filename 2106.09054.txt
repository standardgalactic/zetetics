Abstract
We present a novel double-copy prescription for gauge ﬁelds at the Lagrangian level
and apply it both to the original double copy and the soft theorem. The Yang-
Mills Lagrangian in light-cone gauge is mapped directly to the N = 0 supergravity
Lagrangian in light-cone gauge to trilinear order, and we show that the obtained
result is manifestly equivalent to Einstein gravity at tree level up to this order.
The application of the double-copy prescription to the soft-collinear eﬀective QCD
Lagrangian yields an eﬀective description of an energetic Dirac fermion coupled to the
graviton, Kalb-Ramond, and dilaton ﬁelds, from which the fermionic gravitational
soft and next-to-soft theorems follow.

Introduction
The double-copy or colour-kinematics duality property refers to the observation that tree-
level graviton scattering amplitudes in Einstein-Hilbert gravity can be obtained by “squaring”
tree-level Yang-Mills scattering amplitudes with the replacement of colour factors by kinematic
factors.
The ﬁrst indication of the connection between gauge theory and gravity was provided by
the Kawai-Lewellen-Tye (KLT) relations [1]. The modern formulation of this duality was then
conjectured by Bern, Carrasco and Johansson in [2], thereafter dubbed BCJ duality. The
general proof for tree-level amplitudes was subsequently given in [3] using BCFW recursion
relations [4,5] and immediately extended to loop amplitudes via generalized unitarity in the
same work. This formulation of the duality has since then seen a plethora of further extensions,
see [6] for a comprehensive review. The property also often generalizes to the couplings to
matter [7,8] and to (supersymmetric) eﬀective ﬁeld theories, such as the non-linear sigma model
and Dirac Born-Infeld theory, see [9,10] and references therein. The double-copy property is
usually thought to hold at the level of on-shell amplitudes, not at the level of Lagrangians,
reﬂecting the fact that the Lagrangian carries redundant information if one is only interested
in scattering amplitudes. Its deeper origin and scope are not fully understood.
The present work is motivated by the attempt to construct the soft theorem for gravitons
from the soft theorem for gluons via the double-copy of soft-collinear Lagrangians. Such an
approach can be seen as complementary to the elegant derivation within the spinor-helicity
formalism [11, 12], where the double-copy property of tree amplitudes follows from the cor-
responding property of the three-point amplitude and the recursive construction of n-point
amplitudes [3]. The soft-collinear eﬀective (SCET) Lagrangian employs only ﬁelds that corre-
spond directly to the collinear and soft on-shell degrees of freedom in a hard scattering process.
For example, the gauge-invariant collinear gluon ﬁeld Aµ = W †[iDµW], where W denotes a
semi-inﬁnite Wilson line along the light-like direction nµ
+, satisﬁes n+ · A = 0, and the La-
grangian can be expressed entirely in terms of the two transverse components of Aµ. In the
absence of soft ﬁelds, the collinear Lagrangian of SCET provides a gauge-invariant formulation
of the theory in light-cone gauge [13, 14]. While the soft-collinear Lagrangian does contain
(irrelevant) oﬀ-shell information, its formulation in terms of physical degree-of-freedom ﬁelds
suggests that the double-copy property could be more easily made manifest in this framework.
In the following, we show that indeed a novel mapping can be found which parallels colour-
kinematics duality at the amplitude level but which acts directly on ﬁelds and operations on
ﬁelds and is therefore not limited to the application to pure gauge theory. We ﬁrst use it to
map the Lagrangian of Yang-Mills theory to the one of N = 0 supergravity up to cubic order
and show its equivalence to Einstein gravity for tree-level amplitudes with only gravitons in
the initial and ﬁnal states. We ﬁnd that this becomes possible once light-cone gauge has been
ﬁxed, in agreement with the expectation that gauge redundancy obscures the link between the
two theories. We then go on to show that the soft and next-to-soft theorems for the emission
of a gluon and graviton from matter can be similarly related by applying the same mapping
to the soft-collinear interaction terms directly in the SCET Lagrangian.
In the present treatment, the prescription to obtain the gravitational theory from the gauge
1

theory can be interpreted as trading the gauge group of Yang-Mills theory, SU(N), for the
gauge group of Einstein gravity, Diﬀ(M). This eﬀectively amounts to the substitution given
in (2.6) below together with a pairing prescription, oﬀering a geometric and as-yet unexplored
intuition of colour-kinematics duality.
As a consequence of the manifest duality between
the Lagrangians, the three-point vertex Feynman rules in light-cone gauge satisfy an explicit
squaring relation, and they do so oﬀ-shell.
Previous attempts towards a Lagrangian version of the double copy started in [15], where
tree-level QCD amplitudes were double-copied to gravity amplitudes up to ﬁve points. A La-
grangian which would reproduce the obtained gravitational amplitudes was written down, and
it was argued that it is equivalent to the Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian for on-shell amplitudes.
However, this is not what we have in mind when referring to the double copy of Lagrangians,
since we would like to directly map Lagrangians onto Lagrangians without having to take a
detour through the amplitudes.
In [16] it was shown that the Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian up to quartic order could be
rewritten adopting light-cone gauge, expressing it explicitly in terms of the two propagating
helicity modes of the graviton, and then performing a canonical ﬁeld redeﬁnition to obtain
a form where the coeﬃcients of the Fourier-transformed Lagrangian follow from applying
the KLT relations to the Fourier-transformed coeﬃcients of the CSW Lagrangian [17]. This
approach still relies on the knowledge of colour-kinematics duality at the amplitude level
and, further, on a non-standard representation of both the Einstein-Hilbert and Yang-Mills
Lagrangians, which obscures whether the results also apply to scattering processes which
cannot be obtained via the MHV rules, such as the (+ + −) helicity amplitude.
In [3] a modiﬁed but equivalent version of the standard Yang-Mills Lagrangian, yielding
Feynman rules already in BCJ dual form up to quintic order, was found and brought to a form
containing only trilinear interaction terms using auxiliary ﬁelds. The obtained expression was
then stripped of colour factors and “squared” order by order, meaning that two copies of
the colour-stripped expression were multiplied together, and the pairs of gauge ﬁelds were
identiﬁed with graviton ﬁelds, to obtain a Lagrangian which leads to the correct double-
copy amplitudes. This squaring procedure was corroborated by the observation in [18] that
the Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian can be written in an “index-factorized” form, which means
that the index structure allows for two distinct sets of indices to be deﬁned, which never get
contracted with each other. Again, in [3] the Yang-Mills Lagrangian was written in an unusual
way to get a gravitational Lagrangian in terms of an inﬁnite tower of auxiliary ﬁelds, whereas
we would like to ﬁnd a direct mapping from the Yang-Mills Lagrangian, expressed only in
terms of the standard gauge ﬁeld, to the Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian, expressed in terms of
the metric perturbation. The approach in [3] was adapted to the Yang-Mills Lagrangian in
light-cone gauge in [19], and the explicit quintic order modiﬁcation to the Lagrangian was
given, although [19] did not explore how to obtain a gravity Lagrangian from their result.
More recently, in [20,21] it was shown abstractly that an equivalent representation of the
full N = 0 supergravity Lagrangian can be obtained by squaring a redeﬁned version of the
BRST Yang-Mills Lagrangian, containing only cubic interaction terms. Finally, in [22] the
BRST Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian up to cubic order was explicitly obtained by “squaring”
the trilinear BRST Yang-Mills Lagrangian, and the ghost ﬁelds proved crucial for the success of
2

their approach. This result bears the closest resemblance to one of our main results. However,
the approach is diﬀerent, since we will ﬁx the ghost-free light-cone gauge and only work with
physical degrees of freedom. While the idea of ﬁxing light-cone gauge to eliminate redundancies
at the Lagrangian level is not new, to the best of our knowledge, it has never been used in
the context of a direct map from the Yang-Mills to the Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian, nor were
couplings to matter investigated using this method.

Colour-kinematics duality prescription for ﬁelds
The main new idea underlying the following mappings is to replace the Lie algebra of the gauge
group SU(N) of Yang-Mills theory by the algebra of tangent vector ﬁelds on the spacetime
manifold M, which are the generators of diﬀeomorphisms on M. In the following, we will
assume a ﬂat background metric ηµν with signature (+, −, −, −).
Speciﬁcally, we map the colour generators T a to colour-stripped gauge tangent vector ﬁelds
times a factor of −i,1
T a 7→−i ˜Aµ(x)∂µ .
(2.1)
To deﬁne the classical double-copy ﬁeld Hµν, we replace the sum over the adjoint colour index
a by a convolution
Aa
µ(x)T a 7→−i(Aµ ∗˜Aν)(x)∂ν ≡−iI

Aµ
 ˜Aν

∂ν ≡−iHµν(x)∂ν ,
(2.2)
in analogy to [3]. We follow the notation of [23], where the double-copy ﬁeld is called “fat
graviton”. We introduced the pairing operation I, and, in a product of multiple ﬁelds on which
we apply this mapping below, we introduce labels to clarify which ﬁelds belong together.
The gauge ﬁeld Aa
µ(x)T a is a Hermitian matrix with respect to the inner product on CN,
so we need to map it to an object which is still Hermitian, now with respect to the L2 inner
product
⟨φ, ψ⟩≡
Z
d4x φ∗(x)ψ(x) .
(2.3)
The derivative −i∂µ is Hermitian with respect to (2.3), but the object −iHµν(x)∂ν is not, since,
in general, ∂νHµν is non-vanishing. To remedy this, we need to work with the double-copy
ﬁeld in a transverse gauge, such that it satisﬁes
∂νHµν(x) = 0 .
(2.4)
To ensure this, we construct it from Aa
µ in a gauge which satisﬁes
∂µAa
µ(x) = 0 + O(A2) ,
(2.5)
1The tilde on the Aµ ﬁeld is temporarily introduced to distinguish it from the Aµ ﬁeld that multiplies the
generator in the equation below.
3

since we are deﬁning a linear prescription.
The mapping (2.2) is then equivalent to the
manifestly Hermitian mapping
T a 7→−i
2 [ ˜Aµ(x)
→
∂µ −
←
∂µ ˜Aµ(x)] ,
Aa
µ(x)T a 7→−i
2 [Hµν(x)
→
∂ν −
←
∂νHµν(x)] ,
(2.6)
when appearing under an integral, as in (2.3).
The partial derivatives ∂µ are the basis vectors of the tangent space at each point of
Minkowski space M. We denote the set of tangent vector ﬁelds on M as Γ(TM) and the ring
of real-valued functions on M as F(M). We use the standard deﬁnitions of the Minkowski
metric tensor η,
η: Γ(TM) × Γ(TM) →F(M) ,
η(V (x), W(x)) = V µ(x)W ν(x)η(∂µ, ∂ν) ≡V µ(x)W ν(x)ηµν ,
(2.7)
as well as of the Lie bracket of vector ﬁelds in Γ(TM),2
[·, ·]L : Γ(TM) × Γ(TM) →Γ(TM) ,
[V (x), W(x)]L =(V µ∂µW ν −W µ∂µV ν)∂ν .
(2.8)
Armed with these deﬁnitions, we are now ready to deﬁne the remaining mappings of
colour-kinematics duality. The commutator [·, ·] of colour generators, which satisﬁes
[T a, T b] = if abcT c
(2.9)
with the totally antisymmetric structure constants f abc, is mapped to the Lie bracket of tangent
vectors [·, ·]L times a factor of −1/2,3
[·, ·] 7→−1
2 [·, ·]L ,
(2.10)
such that
[T a, T b]
(2.1)
7→−1
2[−iA1µ∂µ, −iA2ν∂ν]L = 1
2(A1µ∂µA2ν −A2µ∂µA1ν)∂ν .
(2.11)
The superscripts 1, 2 refer to the labels mentioned above.
The operation of taking the trace over colour generators is mapped to the operation of
taking the inner product of tangent vectors by means of the metric tensor η times a factor
1/2, which accounts for the normalization of the colour generators
tr(T aT b) = 1
2 δab .
(2.12)
2In the following, derivatives (and inverse derivatives) act only on the object immediately next to them,
except if multiple objects are grouped in a bracket, such as ∂µ(fg).
3The factor −1/2 is related to the fact that the standard double-copy refers to the rescaled structure
constants deﬁned in (3.11) below.
4

We have to ensure that the symmetries of the colour indices of the generators before the
mapping and the labels of the colour-stripped ﬁelds after the mapping match. If they do not,
we sum over all necessary permutations of the labels until they do. Therefore, we have:
tr(··) 7→1
2
X
perm.
η(·, ·) .
(2.13)
Single generators are traceless, therefore
0 = tr(T a1) 7→1
2Aµη(−i∂µ, 0) = 0 ,
(2.14)
which means that the neutral element of the algebra of SU(N) is mapped to the trivial tangent
vector ﬁeld 0. In the case of only two generators, we simply have
tr(T aT b) 7→1
2η(−iA1µ∂µ, −iA2ν∂ν) = −1
2A1µA2νη(∂µ, ∂ν) = −1
2A1
µA2µ .
(2.15)
Finally, a totally antisymmetric object, such as tr(T a[T b, T c]), gets mapped to
tr(T a[T b, T c]) 7→−i

(2.16)
which is totally antisymmetric in the labels. This is the reason why we introduced the sum
over permutations of the labels in (2.13). Lastly, we have to trade the strong coupling gs for
the gravitational one,
gs 7→κ
2 ,
(2.17)
where κ ≡√32πGN.
We have to map multiple products of gauge ﬁelds with their respective generators. As
mentioned above, the operation I pairs up multiple colour-stripped gauge ﬁelds according to
their labels and identiﬁes each pair with a double-copy ﬁeld. It should also yield a vanishing
result if we try to pair up two strings of ﬁelds of diﬀerent length. We deﬁne it as

Finally, we need to determine which types of particles are described by the double-copy
ﬁeld. To build Hµν, we take the convolution of two distinct copies of colour-stripped gauge
ﬁelds, which contain two on-shell degrees of freedom each. Hence, the double-copy ﬁeld Hµν
contains four degrees of freedom and has no particular symmetry in its indices.
We can
therefore decompose it as a sum of a symmetric-traceless part hµν, an antisymmetric part
Bµν, and a trace part φ, in analogy to [23],
Hµν(x) = hµν(x) + Bµν(x) + Cµνφ(x) ,
(2.20)
where
hµν(x) ≡1
2H(µν)(x) −CµνHρ
ρ(x) ,
Bµν(x) ≡1
2H[µν](x) ,
φ(x) ≡Hµ
µ(x) .
(2.21)
Here, Cµν is a symmetric operator which satisﬁes
Cµ
µφ(x) = φ(x) ,
(2.22)
and we used a shorthand notation for (anti-)symmetrization in a pair of indices:
x(µyν) ≡xµyν + xνyµ ,
x[µyν] ≡xµyν −xνyµ .
(2.23)
The symmetric-traceless part of Hµν is identiﬁed with the graviton, the antisymmetric part
with the Kalb-Ramond, and the trace part with the dilaton ﬁeld; the theory describing the
dynamics of these ﬁelds is usually referred to as N = 0 supergravity.

Yang-Mills and Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangians in light-
cone gauge
3.1
Yang-Mills
We want to rearrange the Yang-Mills Lagrangian by using the gluon ﬁeld in light-cone gauge,
Aa
µ, which is deﬁned by
n+ · Aa ≡0
(3.1)
with respect to a light-like vector nµ
+. Deﬁning a second light-like vector nµ
−, which satisﬁes
n+ · n−= 2, we can decompose the gluon ﬁeld in light-cone gauge as
Aa
µ = n−· Aa n+µ
2
+ Aa
µ⊥.
(3.2)
The ﬁeld Aa
µ⊥denotes the components perpendicular to both nµ
±. From now on, we abbreviate
n± · v ≡v± for any vector vµ and use Latin letters from the middle of the alphabet to denote
transverse vector indices.
6

Only the transverse ﬁeld components Aa
i are physical and propagating, so we integrate out
the ﬁeld component Aa
−by means of its equation of motion, which reads
Aa
−= −2
∂+
∂iAai + 2gsf abc 1
∂2
+
(Ab
i∂+Aic) .
(3.3)
Indeed,
∂µAa
µ = 0 + O(A2) ,
(3.4)
as required in Section 2. The transverse indices are still lowered by means of the transverse
metric ηij = −δij so that Ai = −Ai.
Since the colour-kinematics duality mapping acts on the colour generators themselves, we
make them explicit. The Yang-Mills Lagrangian in light-cone gauge then reads

Lagrangian. The double-copy ﬁeld is in light-cone gauge, H+µ = 0, and therefore
Hµν = hµν + Bµν + Cµνφ ,

which is motivated by the known “squaring” relationship between the gluon and graviton

This is also the route taken in [22] to derive the cubic Einstein-
Hilbert Lagrangian via a double-copy construction. The authors of [22], however, needed to
implement a non-linear ﬁeld redeﬁnition of hµν in the Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian to show the
equivalence of the graviton interaction terms obtained via double copy. Here it is immediately
manifest, because we work only with physical degrees of freedom, and the result follows from
the geometrically motivated mapping prescription.
We can again go back to a manifestly covariant form to ﬁnd:

L(κ)
grav is the same expression, up to the overall coupling, as constructed in [25] using the Noether
procedure. However, unlike in [25], we obtain this result by a rather straightforward mapping
and pairing operation. We do not derive the CK-dual of the Yang-Mills four-point Lagrangian,
since we cannot expect the linear CK mapping to work beyond the trilinear interaction.
4.3
Eliminating the dilaton
We have now obtained the double copy of the Yang-Mills Lagrangian in light-cone gauge up
to trilinear order, but we still have to check that this theory reproduces pure Einstein gravity
at tree level. To this end, we substitute the decomposition (4.1) of Hµν into the double-copied
Lagrangian. The kinetic term becomes

(4.12)
Analogously, we obtain the full double-copied trilinear interaction Lagrangian by plugging
(4.1) into (4.8), see Appendix A. Since the Kalb-Ramond ﬁeld Bij is antisymmetric in its
indices, it can only appear in pairs in the trilinear interaction terms, which is indeed what
we ﬁnd. Therefore these vertices cannot contribute to a tree-level scattering amplitude with
only gravitons as external states. The trilinear terms that can contribute to tree-level pure

graviton scattering amplitudes read

We ﬁnd the same trilinear graviton interactions as in Section 3.2, but additional terms of the
form hhφ appear, which suggest that the theory described by this Lagrangian deviates from
pure Einstein gravity at tree level, starting from the four-point graviton scattering amplitude,
which could have an internal dilaton line. For instance, the following two s-channel 2 →2
graviton scattering diagrams are possible in the CK-dual theory:
The dashed line represents the dilaton propagator. The analogous diagrams exist for the t-
and u-channels. However, the dilaton exchange contribution can be shown to be equivalent
to a four-point graviton contact vertex at O(κ2) by applying the dilaton equation of motion,
and hence is not relevant at the level of trilinear interactions considered here. To see this, we
integrate by parts in the hhφ interaction Lagrangian to obtain

(4.14)
Using the linearized equation of motion of the graviton,
∂k∂khij = −∂+∂−hij + O(κ) ,
(4.15)
the last term in (4.14) is rewritten as
φ 1

(4.17)
12

The dilaton equation-of-motion □φ = 0 + O(κ) now allows us to push all oﬀending terms to
O(κ2). Diﬀerent from what was found in [15], this does not generate non-local hhhh couplings,
where by “non-local” we mean containing 1/□. We therefore have no hhφ interaction vertex at
all, the remaining interaction terms between the graviton and the other ﬁelds are of the form
hφφ and hBB and do not contribute to tree-level scattering amplitudes with only gravitons in
the initial and ﬁnal states. The double-copied Lagrangian is therefore manifestly equivalent to
the Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian up to trilinear order when considering pure-graviton, tree-level
scattering amplitudes.
In [22] the dilaton was eliminated by coupling well-chosen unphysical sources to the BRST
ghost ﬁelds, and it was observed that this can be done without constraining the source terms
for the graviton. Here, since we work in light-cone gauge, which is ghost-free, we ﬁnd that the
dilaton decouples by itself from pure-graviton, tree-level scattering processes.
4.4
Double-copied three-point vertex Feynman rule
We immediately see the squaring relationship between the three-gluon vertex (3.10) and the
three-graviton vertex (3.25) in light-cone gauge:
κV ij,kl,mn
EH
(p1, p2, p3) = κ
2V ikm
YM (p1, p2, p3)V jln
YM(p1, p2, p3) .
(4.18)
This holds oﬀ-shell, and reﬂects the CK-duality between the trilinear gauge and gravitational
Lagrangians in this gauge. It is merely a consequence of having expressed both the Yang-
Mills and Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangians only through the respective physical ﬁeld components.
Since contracting the vertices with polarization vectors or tensors does not change anything,
this relationship between the Feynman rules immediately implies the well-known “squaring”
between gauge and gravity three-point amplitudes if the graviton polarization tensor is iden-
tiﬁed with the symmetric-traceless part of the direct product of two colour-stripped gluon
polarization vectors in momentum space:

Next-to-soft graviton theorem from colour-kinematics
dual SCET
The colour-kinematics duality mapping presented above not only applies to pure-gauge La-
grangians, but also to Lagrangians describing the coupling of matter to gauge ﬁelds.
To
illustrate this, we apply it to the soft-collinear eﬀective theory (SCET) of QCD to derive the
fermionic soft and next-to-soft graviton theorem from the corresponding gauge theory results.
5.1
Gravitational soft theorem
The soft theorem in gauge theory is known as the Low-Burnett-Kroll (LBK) theorem [26,27],
which states that, given a non-radiative scattering amplitude Afull of n energetic particles, the
13

amplitude AA for the emission of an additional soft gauge boson has the universal form

(5.2)
with Ah the gravitation-radiation amplitude. In both cases, Ai is the non-radiative amplitude
with the i-th polarization function stripped oﬀ:
Afull = ψiAi
(no sum over i) .
(5.3)
This makes explicit that the soft factor in the square brackets in (5.1), (5.2) acts only on
the amplitude without the polarization functions, which will be important later on. Writing
the soft theorems in this manner emphasizes that they really stem from the presence of soft
momenta in the scattering process, not from the properties of the external legs. Further,
Jµν
i
≡Lµν
i
+ Sµν

(5.4)
is the angular momentum operator, separated into the orbital angular momentum operator
Lµν
i
≡p[µ
i
∂
∂pν]i
,
(5.5)
and the spin operator Sµν
i , which takes into account the intrinsic angular momentum of the
particles, in the appropriate representation of the Lorentz group. Since we are interested in
the fermionic version of the soft theorem, the spin operator reads
Sµν
i u(pi) = 1
4[γµ, γν]u(pi) ,
¯u(pi)Sµν
i
= −1
4 ¯u(pi)[γµ, γν]
(5.6)
when acting on Dirac spinors u(p) and their adjoint ¯u(p) ≡u†(p)γ0 in Afull. We can therefore
summarize the action of Sµν
i
on the fermionic amplitude as
Sµν
i
→ηi
4 [γµ, γν] ,
(5.7)
where, following the notation of [28],
ηi ≡
(
+1 ,
i-th particle outgoing
−1 ,
i-th particle incoming .
(5.8)
Comparing the soft factors in the gauge and gravitational cases, we already see the colour-
kinematics duality prescription manifest itself, since (5.2) can be obtained from (5.1) by the
replacements
εa
µ(k)T a →εµν(k)pµ
i ,
gs →κ
2 .
(5.9)
We will show that this follows from the corresponding relation for the soft emission eﬀective
Lagrangians.

5.2
Eﬀective Lagrangian from colour-kinematics duality
We now apply the mappings deﬁned earlier to the SCET QCD Lagrangian in the position-
space formalism given in [13,14] and obtain an eﬀective description for a fermion coupled to
gravity. To construct the Lagrangian, we apply the mapping (2.2) to the soft gluon ﬁeld,
Aa
sµT a 7→−iSµν∂ν ,
(5.10)
where
Sµν = sµν + Bs,µν + Cµνφs ,
(5.11)
with the soft graviton, Kalb-Ramond, and dilaton ﬁelds. We assume Sµν to be in a transverse
gauge as well, such that ∂µSµν = 0. The λ-scaling of the soft double-copy ﬁeld is Sµν ∼λ2 [29].
Using the rules established in Section 2, the soft ﬁeld-strength tensor is mapped to
F a
s,µνT a 7→−iKs,µνρ∂ρ ,
(5.12)
with
Ks,µνρ ≡∂µSνρ −∂νSµρ + κ


Sµσ∂σSνρ −Sνσ∂σSµρ

,
(5.13)
which satisﬁes ∂ρKµνρ = 0 to linear order, as suﬃcient. The gauge-covariant derivative for the
fermion ﬁeld, Dµ, is mapped to
iDµ = i∂µ + gsAa
µT a 7→iDµ ≡i∂µ −iκ
2 Sµν(x)∂ν .
(5.14)
Applying these mappings to the soft-collinear interaction Lagrangians L(m)
ξ
, m = 0, 1, 2
up to order O(λ2) (explicit expressions given in Appendix B) and ﬁxing collinear light-cone
gauge, yields the eﬀective Lagrangian for the emission of a soft graviton from an energetic

The Feynman rules for the interaction vertices between collinear fermions and a soft graviton
up to O(λ2) are given in Appendix C. For completeness, we also show the non-linear terms
in Sµν, which follow from the prescription. However, as discussed below, since we expect that
the linear mapping prescription should receive higher-order corrections, only the terms linear
in Sµν in the above Lagrangian should be taken for granted. These suﬃce to derive the soft
theorem, which refers to single-graviton emission.
5.3
Deriving the soft theorem
We now derive the soft theorem from the soft-collinear gravity Lagrangian including subleading
powers, as obtained from the CK-duality mapping. For N energetic particles with momenta
pi, well-separated in angle, the Lagrangian takes the form
LSCET =
N
X
i=1
LD,i(ψi, ψs) + Ls(ψs) ,
(5.18)
with LD,i the CK-dual soft-collinear Lagrangian for the i-th collinear sector, given by (5.15)
to (5.17) with the replacement n+ →ni+, and Ls the purely soft Lagrangian. Notably, i-
collinear ﬁelds only interact among themselves and with soft ﬁelds, but not with collinear
ﬁelds of another direction. To simplify the computation of the radiative amplitude, we adopt
a frame in which the external momenta pµ
i are aligned with the light-like reference vectors nµ
i−,
i = 1, ..., n, which implies pi⊥= 0, pi−= 0. This choice can always be made.
In addition to the Lagrangian, which describes soft emission, we need source operators,
which generate the energetic particles, and possibly soft particles. A generic operator in QCD
SCET takes the form [30,31]
J =
Z
dt C({tik})Js(0)
N
Y
i=1
Ji(ti1, ti2, . . . ) ,
(5.19)
where dt = Q
ik dtik, C is the matching coeﬃcient, Js is a purely soft building block, and Ji
are the collinear building blocks. An important observation is that up to O(λ2), Js(0) = 1 by
gauge invariance. Hence, to derive the (next-to-) soft theorem, only collinear source building
blocks are available, and the soft gluon must arise from a soft emission Lagrangian vertex.
For more details on the operator basis, we refer to [30,31].
Applying the mappings of Section 2 to this operator basis is trivial in collinear light-cone
gauge, which sets all collinear Wilson lines Wc = 1. The relevant collinear building block is
the spinor ﬁeld χi = ξi and its transverse derivatives up to O(λ2),
O(λ0) :
JA0
χi (ti) = χi(tini+) ,
O(λ1) :
JA1µ
∂χi (ti) = i∂µ
i⊥χi(tini+) ,
O(λ2) :
JA2µν
∂2χi (ti) = i∂µ
i⊥i∂ν
i⊥χi(tini+) ,
(5.20)
16

in complete analogy to the QCD case. Current operators involving more than one collinear
building block in a single collinear sector, such as the Bn- or Cn-type operators [30,31], cannot
contribute here, since we assume that we have exactly one collinear particle in each sector,
and work at tree level. Notably, up to O(λ2), there are also no soft building blocks in the
gravitational case.
In addition to the subleading contributions due to A1, A2 currents, power-suppressed next-
to-soft terms arise from time-ordered products of the current operators with the subleading
Lagrangian,
JTn(ti) = i
Z
d4x T{JA0(ti)L(n)
ξ,i (x)} ,
(5.21)
representing subleading interaction vertices. As we will see below, the entire soft theorem
stems from such time-ordered products.
With the notation set up, we calculate the soft graviton emission amplitude in SCET
gravity. Given the adopted frame, the non-radiative amplitude is simply
Afull = ⟨q(p1) . . . q(pn)|

(5.22)
We take all particles to be outgoing. This evaluates to
Afull = ¯ξ1...nCA0({pi+}) ,
(5.23)
where
¯ξ1...n ≡¯ξ1(p1)...¯ξn(pn) ,
(5.24)
and we suppress both the spinor indices of the ξi and of the Fourier-transformed Wilson
coeﬃcient, which is deﬁned by
C(ti) =
Z
dpi e−itipiC(pi) .
(5.25)
We use the short-hand notations pi± ≡ni± · p and εi±,j± ≡nµ
i±nν
j±εµν, and, for the sake of
conciseness, abbreviate ⟨q(p1) . . . q(pn)| to ⟨q|.
The CA1 coeﬃcient is completely determined in terms of CA0 by reparametrization invari-
ance constraints. For all-outgoing fermions, it is given by

(5.26)
The ﬁrst summand contributes to the reparametrization invariant completion of the two-
component spinor ξ [32] and the second summand holds for any type of collinear particle, and
represents the generalization [33] to n distinct collinear directions of the relation given in [34].
In the full theory this term stems from the expansion of the (stripped) hard amplitude in the
SCET power-counting, as will be seen below.

consistent with the expansion in the soft momentum. The second line of (5.27) is not vanishing:

vanishing. It naively looks like an O(λ)-term, however, it actually counts as O(λ2), since the
pi⊥-derivatives always cancel factors of pµ
i⊥in the non-radiative amplitude.
We have already matched the A0-coeﬃcient in (5.23), so we immediately see that the ﬁrst
and last lines of (5.32) reproduce every term but the last one in the ﬁrst line of (5.33). This
last term must be reproduced by the second line of (5.32). It therefore remains to show that

To see this, we observe that the non-radiative amplitude in momentum space, before setting

with the same A0- and A1-coeﬃcients as given above. From (5.3), we therefore ﬁnd

The ﬁrst term on the left-hand side of (5.36) reproduces the CA1µ
i,spinor({pi+}) piece of (5.26),
hence, to O(λ2), (5.36) gives

(5.38)
which proves (5.34).
Therefore the SCET result (5.32) is precisely the i-th summand of the soft theorem (5.33).
Summing over all i, we obtain the full expression. This shows that the colour-kinematics du-
ality at the Lagrangian level indeed is the origin of the the colour-kinematics duality apparent
in the LBK theorem and the gravitational next-to-soft theorem.

Conclusion
We ﬁnd it interesting that colour-kinematics duality or double-copy relations between gauge
theory and gravitational amplitudes can be made manifest at the level of Lagrangians rather
than amplitudes, once one ﬁxes light-cone gauge, in which only the physical degrees of freedom
appear as dynamical ﬁelds. Moreover, the duality can be constructed in a very direct way
from the simple mapping (2.1) of the colour to the diﬀeomorphism generators together with
a pairing prescription for products of ﬁelds.
The new prescription also holds for couplings to matter, and we exempliﬁed this by double-
copying the soft-collinear eﬀective QCD Lagrangian including subleading-power interactions
to obtain the corresponding SCET gravity terms. These indeed produce the correct soft and
next-to-soft theorems for the emission of gravitons, here for Dirac fermions.
The severest short-coming of the approach described here is that it works in its simple
form only for trilinear interactions. The linear mappings (2.1), (2.2) will most likely have to
be extended by non-linear terms to be able to go beyond the trilinear order. However, we
have not found so far a principle that would allow us to construct the required form. We
nevertheless hope that the observations made here will lead to further insights into the deeper
origin of colour-kinematics duality.
