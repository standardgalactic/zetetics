The food protein ingredient market is dominated by dairy and egg proteins. Both milk whey and egg proteins are 
challenging proteins to replace, e.g. with plant proteins, due to the unique structural features of the animal 
proteins that render them highly functional. Thus, to provide a non-animal source of these important proteins the 
fungal host Trichoderma reesei was utilized for the biotechnical production of recombinant hen ovalbumin 
(TrOVA) and bovine beta lactoglobulin (TrBLG). These food proteins were investigated using two different 
promoter systems to test the concept of effectively expressing them in a fungal host. Both proteins were suc­
cessfully produced in 24 well plate and bioreactor scale. The production level of TrBLG and TrOVA were 1 g/L 
and 2 g/L, respectively. Both proteins were further purified and characterized, and their functional properties 
were tested. TrBLG and TrOVA secondary structures determined by circular dichroism corresponded to the 
proteins of bovine and hen. The T. reesei produced proteins were found to be N-glycosylated, mostly with Man 5. 
TrBLG had emulsification properties matching to corresponding bovine protein. TrOVA showed excellent 
foaming characteristics and heat-induced gelation, although the strength of the gel was somewhat lower than 
with hen ovalbumin, possibly due to the partial degradation of TrOVA or presence of other host proteins. 
Biotechnical production of whey and egg proteins using precision fermentation technology offers an innovative 
way to increase the sustainability of the conventional food industry, without further reliance on animal farming. 
Industrial relevance: The food protein ingredient market is dominated by dairy (largely whey proteins) and 
egg proteins. Whey proteins are valuable and versatile food ingredients due to their functional and nutritional 
quality. They are largely used in meat and milk products, low fat products, bakery, confectionary, infant formulas 
and sports nutrition. Similarly, egg white protein ovalbumin is a highly functional protein ingredient that fa­
cilitates structure formation and high nutritional quality in most food products. Together they comprise 40–70% 
of the revenue in the animal protein ingredients market. Both whey and egg proteins are extremely challenging 
proteins to replace, e.g., by plant proteins due to their unique structural features that render them with high 
functionality. Biotechnical production of whey and egg proteins using precision fermentation technology offers 
an innovative way to increase the sustainability of the conventional food industry, without further reliance on 
animal farming.   
1. Introduction 
Two of the biggest challenges we face today are to assure global food 
security and to minimize carbon footprint of food production, which 
comprises around one quarter of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emis­
sions. A recent study by Xu et al. (2021) revealed that production of

animal-based food products (including feed) comprises 57 % of GHG 
emissions caused by food production. Despite the high cost of livestock 
industry to environmental stability, certain nutrients and their role in 
industrial food production is not readily replaceable. For example, 
animal-based proteins such as milk and egg proteins play major role in 
structure formation and nutritional quality of various food products. 
Biotechnology offers attractive alternatives to production of the most 
critical animal protein ingredients using food industry microbes instead 
of relying on animal farming. 
Cellular agriculture or precision fermentation in this case, refers to 
using engineered (recombinant) food grade microorganisms and 
fermentation technologies for production of specific organic molecules 
such as food proteins (Chai et al., 2022; Ercili-Cura & Barth, 2020; 
Rischer et al., 2020). Various wild-type or recombinant host organisms, 
e.g., fungi, yeast and bacteria, are already used to produce numerous 
added value components for the pharmaceutical and food industries. For 
example, the recombinant enzyme chymosin used in cheese production 
or various hydrolytic enzymes used in bakery and beverage applications 
are produced by similar bioprocesses (Hicks et al., 1988). Production of 
recombinant food proteins, such as milk and egg proteins can be 
postulated as a next logical step, and a recent analysis of the microbial 
production of egg proteins indicates that the production method can 
have a significant positive environmental impact due to a substantial 
reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and land use when compared to 
egg white production by traditional chicken farming (J¨arvi¨o et al., 2021; 
Kumar et al., 2010). 
β-lactoglobulin (BLG), is the main protein found in ruminant milk 
whey, i.e., proteins other than caseins. It comprises 10–15 % of total 
milk proteins (Aich et al., 2015; Kontopidis et al., 2004). Interestingly, it 
is not present in human milk. Bovine BLG is a small protein consisting of 
162 amino acid residues with a molecular weight of 18.4 kDa. Each BLG 
monomer has one free cysteine and two disulfide bridges folded in a 
calyx shaped globular structure. Its amino acid sequence and structure 
reveal that it is a lipocalin, which is a wide diverse family of transport 
proteins that often bind hydrophobic ligands such as lipids, retinoids, 
and bilins. Due to its well-defined structural features, BLG has been 
widely used as a model in proteomics studies and has been also produced 
by various recombinant organisms such as Pichia pastoris (Kim et al., 
1997), E. coli (Batt et al., 1990), and Lactobacillus casei (Hazebrouck 
et al., 2007). 
Ovalbumin (OVA) is a storage protein that is the dominant protein in 
egg white, constituting 54 % of total protein in egg white. OVA has a 
molecular weight of 45 kDa and consists of 386 amino acid residues 
including six cysteines with a single disulfide bond, and the polypeptide 
chain includes N-terminal acetylation, phosphorylation (Ser69, Ser345), 
and glycosylation (Asn293) (Huntington & Stein, 2001). Although OVA 
belongs to serpin family, it does not show serine protease inhibitory 
activity and is a member of the subgroup known as ovalbumin-related 
serpins (da Silva et al., 2015; Gettins, 2002). OVA is a secreted protein 
having an internal signal sequence that is not cleaved off (da Silva et al., 
2015; Robinson et al., 1986). OVA typically goes through natural con­
version into S-form which has greater stability compared to the native 
form but lower techno-functionality in food applications (Huntington & 
Stein, 2001). 
The filamentous fungus Trichoderma reesei is the most common 
production host for lignocellulose degrading enzymes used by enzyme 
industries world-wide. It is suitable for large-scale cultivation processes 
(for example, scales up to 500 m3) and has a long history of safe use in 
the enzyme production industry. T. reesei is commonly used for pro­
duction of both endogenous and exogenous food grade enzymes by 
fermentation (Chai et al., 2022; Olempska-Beer et al., 2006). Examples 
of commercial production of food-related enzymes produced by T. reesei 
are for example beta-glucanase used as a filtering aid in brewing, glu­
coamylase used for the production of high fructose corn syrup, and 
xylanase to increase bread volume in baking (Paloheimo et al,. 2016). As 
of July 2022, 24 enzymes (i.e. chymosin, xylanase, pectin lyase, etc.) 
and other protein products including beta-lactoglobulin have obtained 
the generally recognized as safe (GRAS) status by the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) (U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 2022). The 
highest published amount of native extracellular enzyme mixtures 
produced by T. reesei was over 100 g/L (Cherry & Fidantsef, 2003) and 
unpublished total protein quantities up to 115 g/L were achieved (VTT 
unpublished results). Single heterologous proteins such as calB lipase 
(Rantasalo et al., 2019) and interferon alpha 2b (Landowski et al., 2016) 
have been produced at high levels and high purity using the VTT syn­
thetic expression system. Therefore, T. reesei has considerable prospects 
to produce industrially significant amounts of food proteins based upon 
its excellent secretion abilities. Furthermore, T. reesei is a low-cost 
production system that can be cultivated on inexpensive medium with 
relatively short cultivation times (Rantasalo et al., 2019). 
The aim of the present study was to evaluate suitability of the 
T. reesei protein production system for the expression of bovine BLG and 
hen egg OVA. We further analysed the techno-functional properties of 
the proteins produced by the T. reesei system to evaluate their potential 
as food ingredients to replace animal-based counterparts. 
2. Materials and methods 
2.1. Strains 
Escherichia coli DH5α (Life Technologies) was used for propagation of 
the plasmids. Trichoderma reesei strain M1908 was obtained from VTT 
Culture Collection (Espoo, Finland). Strain M1908 was generated from 
M124 strain by sequentially deleting 11 secreted proteases; pep1 
(tre74156), tsp1 (tre73897), pep4 (tre77579), gap1 (tre69555), slp1 
(tre51365), pep3 (tre121133), pep5 (tre81004), pep2 (tre53961), amp2 
(tre108592), slp8 (tre58698) and sep1 (tre124051) as described before 
(Fang et al., 2017; Landowski et al., 2015). The gene identifiers are listed 
according to the Joint Genome Institute T. reesei assembly release 
version 2.0. The fragments used for deletion contained the 5′ and 3′
flanking regions of the target gene and a pyr4 selection marker with a 
loopout fragment. Spore suspensions were prepared by cultivating the 
fungus on potato-dextrose plates (BD, Sparks, Maryland, USA) for 5 
days, after which the spores were harvested, suspended in a buffer 
containing 0.8 % NaCl, 0.025 % Tween-20 and 20 % glycerol, filtered 
through cotton, and stored at −80 ◦C. Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain 
H3488/FY834 was used for yeast recombination-based cloning. 
2.2. Creation of T. reesei strains to express ovalbumin and b-lactoglobulin 
To construct the expression vectors, genes encoding bovine beta- 
lactoglobulin (BLG) and hen ovalbumin (OVA) were codon optimized 
for T. reesei expression by Geneart. The expression vectors B8050 and 
B8053 (BLG) and B8051 and B8054 (OVA) were assembled with the 
yeast recombination cloning method. The BLG and OVA fragments for 
cloning were cut from the Geneart plasmids with restriction enzymes. 
BLG or OVA were inserted into two different expression vector back­
bones. pAWP145 vector contained the synthetic promoter (SES), pdc1 
terminator and expression cassette for synthetic transcription factor sTF. 
Expression vectors with synthetic promoters were named B8050 and 
B8051, for BLG and OVA expression, respectively. pTTv248 vector 
contained a strong inducible cbh1 promoter and terminator. Expression 
vectors with cbh1 promoter were named B8053 and B8054, for BLG and 
OVA expression, respectively. Both vector backbones contained 
hygromycin marker and sequences targeting the expression constructs 
to cbh1 locus in T. reesei genome. After plasmid rescue and trans­
formation into E. coli, all constructs were verified by sequencing. The 
expression cassettes of B8050, B8053, B8051 and B8054 were liberated 
from the plasmid with PmeI restriction enzyme and purified from an 
agarose gel. 
To generate the BLG and OVA producing strains, the M1908 strain 
was transformed with the B8050, B8053, B8051 and B8054 expression

cassettes and grown on MM transformation plates supplemented with 
150 µg/mL hygromycin essentially as described in (Penttil¨a et al., 1987). 
Transformants were screened first by PCR for 5′ and 3′ flank integration 
and absence of the open reading frame. The final production strains with 
synthetic promoter were named M2144 for BLG production strain and 
M2146 for OVA production strain. Strains expressing BLG (referred to as 
TrBLG) and OVA (referred to as TrOVA) from cbh1 promoter were 
named M2174 and M2175, respectively. 
2.3. BLG and OVA T. reesei production strains grown in 24 well culture 
The production strain transformants with cbh1 promoter were grown 
in 24 well plates in minimal medium (TrMM) described by (Landowski 
et al., 2016) supplemented with 40 g/L lactose, 20 g/L spent grain 
extract, 8.6 g/L at pH 4.8, shaking at 28 ◦C at 800 rpm (Infors AG). 
Transformants with the synthetic promoter were grown in TrMM sup­
plemented with 40 g/L glucose, 10 g/L yeast extract at pH 4.8. SDS- 
PAGE gel analysis was done to detect TrBLG and TrOVA produced in 
the culture supernatant. 10–15 µL of culture supernatant was loaded into 
the 4–20 % Criterion gel (BioRad). Sample was mixed with Laemmli 
sample buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol and heated at 95 ◦C for 5 
min. These samples were loaded into a 4–20 % SDS-PAGE gel (BioRad 
TGX Criteron precast gel) along with Precision Plus Protein Standard 
molecular weight marker (BioRad). The gel was run in SDS-PAGE 
running buffer for 30 min at 200 V. The gel was stained with Gel­
Code™ Blue Srain (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and destained with water 
for 2 h. The gels were scanned with the Licor Biosciences CLx at 700 nm 
and the densitometric analysis were carried out with the Licor image 
studio software. 
2.4. Bioreactor cultures of the production strains producing TrBLG, 
TrOVA and background protein 
Pre-cultures for bioreactor inocula were started in Erlenmeyer flasks 
(500–2000 mL containing 20 % volume medium) inoculated with ~ 1 ×
105 spores mL −
1. Inoculums were cultivated for 2 to 3 days at 28 ◦C, 
shaking at 200 rpm in medium containing either 4 % lactose and 20 g/L 
spent grain extract or 40 g/L glucose and 10 g/L yeast extract at pH 5.0, 
for TrBLG and TrOVA production strains respectively. The TrBLG pro­
duction strain M2144 was cultured in 40 g/L lactose, 20 g/L whole spent 
grain, 5 g/L (NH4)2SO4, 5 g/L KH2PO4, with the temperature kept 
constant at 28 ◦C. For OVA production strain M2146 and the control 
parental strain M1908, not expressing any heterologous protein, the 
cultivation medium contained 40 g/L glucose, 10 g/L yeast extract, 5 g/ 
L (NH4)2SO4, 5 g/L KH2PO4. Upon depletion of the batch media glucose 
the cultivation was fed with 55 % glucose at target feed rate of 3.5 g/L/ 
h. The TrOVA cultivation was supplemented with the protease inhibitor 
chymostatin at a final concentration of 10 µM after 72 h of cultivation. 
The pH was maintained at pH 4.8 with addition of 5 % NH4OH and 15 % 
H3PO4. The dissolved oxygen saturation level was greater than 30 %. 
Manual antifoam control was done using Dow Corning 1500 (Danisco 
Ingredients, Denmark). Supernatant samples were taken regularly for 
measurement of the TrBLG and TrOVA concentration. Culture super­
natant was collected by centrifugation and filtration through glass mi­
crofiber filter. 
2.5. Purification of TrBLG and TrOVA 
For purification of TrBLG, the buffer of the TrBLG containing culture 
filtrate was changed to 20 mM Na-phosphate buffer, pH 6.8 using PD-10 
columns (GE Healthcare, Sweden) and the sample was applied on a high- 
resolution anion exchange Resource Q 6 mL column (GE Healthcare) 
pre-equilibrated with 20 mM Na-phosphate buffer, pH 6.8. The bound 
proteins were eluted with a 0–110 mM linear NaCl gradient for 20 col­
umn volumes (CV), where after the NaCl concentration was kept at 110 
mM for 10 column volumes followed by a linear 110–200 mM NaCl for 
20 column volumes. Fractions containing pure TrBLG, as judged by SDS- 
PAGE analysis, were pooled and concentrated using a Vivaspin sample 
concentrator (MWCO 5000; Sartorius, Germany), and the buffer was 
changed to 20 mM Na-phosphate buffer, pH 6.8 using a PD-10 column. 
Altogether, 18 mg of TrBLG was purified from 30 mL culture filtrate. 
A pilot-scale purification aiming at several grams of pure TrBLG, was 
performed using similar conditions as described above. Shortly, 7.7.L (´a 
5.5 g protein/l) of TrBLG containing of buffer exchanged (20 mM Na- 
phosphate buffer, pH 6.8) culture filtrate was applied on a 7.3 L DEAE 
FF column and eluted with a 90–200 mM NaCl gradient. The fractions 
containing pure TrBLG were pooled and concentrated by diafiltration, 
using a membrane having a molecular weight cut-off of 5 kDa. The 
purified BLG sample was used in protein characterization and techno- 
functionality analyses. 
TrOVA was purified in two chromatographic steps for circular di­
chroism analysis. The buffer of the 5 mL concentrated culture filtrate of 
TrOVA bioreactor culture was changed to 15 mM Na-phosphate buffer, 
pH 6 using PD-10 columns (GE Healthcare, Sweden) and the sample was 
applied on a 20 mL anion exchange DEAE Sepharose column (GE 
Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with 15 mM Na-phosphate buffer, pH 6. 
The bound proteins were eluted with a 0–75 mM linear NaCl gradient for 
20 column volumes, where after the NaCl concentration was kept at 75 
mM for 10 column volumes. Fractions containing OVA, as judged by 
SDS-PAGE analysis using 4–20 % Criterion SDS gels (Bio-Rad), were 
collected into two pools which were further purified using a 5 mL phenyl 
Sepharose column equilibrated with 0.5 M (NH4)2SO4 in 25 mM Na- 
phosphate buffer pH 6. Under these conditions, OVA did not bind to 
the column and the flow through was collected and concentrated using a 
Vivaspin sample concentrator (MWCO 5000; Sartorius, Germany) and 
the buffer was changed to 20 mM Na-phosphate buffer, pH 7 using a PD- 
10 column. Altogether, 6 mg of OVA was purified, and the material was 
used in circular dichroism analysis. 
To obtain grams of OVA protein for the techno-functional (foaming 
and gelation) analyses, selective precipitation by addition of NaCl at 
acidic pH, was used as a method to separate TrOVA from culture filtrate. 
The precipitate was removed by centrifugation and the buffer of the 
TrOVA containing supernatant was changed by diafiltration. Briefly, the 
culture supernatant containing TrOVA (13.5 L, ´a 7 g protein /L) pro­
duced as described above, was diafiltrated with water before freeze- 
drying. The freeze-dried powder (50 g) was re-diluted into 9 kg of 20 
mM Na-phosphate buffer, pH 6.5 at room temperature in a 10 L biore­
actor with gentle mixing at 100–200 rpm. The pH was adjusted to 2.5 by 
15 % H3PO4 and after addition of 7 % (w/v) NaCl the pH was set to 2. 
After 1 h incubation at 20 ◦C, the pH of the solution was raised to 6.5 by 
addition of 10 % NaOH. The precipitate was removed by centrifugation 
and the TrOVA containing supernatant was clarified by filtration using a 
Whatman glass microfiber GF/A filter. The buffer was exchanged to 20 
mM Na-phosphate buffer pH 6.5 by diafiltration (MWCO 5 kDa) and 
concentrated before the solution was freeze dried. 
The purification of TrBLG and TrOVA was followed by SDS-PAGE 
analysis using 4–20 % or 10 % Criterion TGX stain-free protein gels 
(Bio-Rad), and the proteins were visualized using the Bio-Rad’s Criterion 
Stain Free gel imaging system (Bio-Rad Laboratories In., Hercules, CA, 
USA). The protein concentration of the supernatant and partially puri­
fied samples were measured with the Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit using 
bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a standard (Bio-Rad laboratories). The 
concentration of the purified proteins was calculated from A280 using a 
theoretical extinction coefficient calculated by ProtParam (ε = 17,210 
M−1 cm−1 and ε = 31,775 M−1 cm−1 for TrBLG and TrOVA, 
respectively). 
2.6. Circular dichroism (CD) 
Circular dichroism (CD) spectra of the purified TrBLG and a control 
BLG (β-lactoglobulin from bovine milk, mixture of A and B variants, 
L3908, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) as well as TrOVA and a 
N. Aro et al.

control OVA protein (chromatographically purified OVA from egg 
white, Worthington LS003056), were recorded on a Chirascan CD 
spectrometer (Applied Photophysics) equipped with a Peltier-controlled 
cuvette holder (PCS.3 single cell holder). Far-UV (190–260 nm) CD 
measurements were performed using approximately 3 μM protein con­
centration in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, at the tempera­
tures 25 ◦C, 90 ◦C and back to 25 ◦C, in a QS quartz cuvette having a 1 
mm light path. Spectra were recorded in duplicate and averaged, using a 
bandwidth of 1 nm, a wavelength step of 0.5 nm, and a time-per-point 
setting of 0.5 s. The CD spectra are presented in measured ellipticities 
(mdeg) without smoothing and the values were corrected for buffer 
contribution. 
2.7. N-glycan analysis 
TrBLG preparation was studied with released N-glycan analysis using 
hilic chromatography with fluorescence detection coupled with high- 
resolution mass spectrometry. Pure TrBLG from pilot scale purifica­
tion, bovine BLG (Sigma-Aldrich, L3908) and as a laboratory reference 
sample a pharmaceutical monoclonal antibody (OPDIVO) were included 
in the analyses. The samples were buffer exchanged and concentrated 
with 10 and 50 (OPDIVO) kDa centrifugal ultrafiltration devices (Merck, 
Sigma-Aldrich) and protein concentrations of the retentates were 
measured with Lowry method (Bio-Rad reagents, Shimadzu spectro­
photometer). Concentration adjusted samples were spiked with 0.06 µg 
of internal standard (sialylglycopeptide), denatured and treated with 
PNGase F enzyme. Released glycans were labelled with RapidFluor re­
agent and purified with HILIC SPE, according to Waters glycoworks 
protocol (Lauber et al., 2015). The glycans were analysed with UPLC- 
FLR-MS analysis as follows. Waters acquity UPLC system coupled to 
Synapt G2-S IMS QTOF, with eluent B as acetonitrile and eluent A as 50 
mM ammonium formate pH 4.4, 2.1 mm × 150 mm Waters Amide BEH 
glycan column was used. Flow was 0.4 mL/min and column temperature 
60 ◦C. Initial condition of 75 % B was held for 1 min and elution from 75 
% to 54 % B then ran from 1 to 20 min, followed by washes and 
equilibration (10 min), total run time 37 min. Fluorescence detection 
excitation wavelength was 265 nm and emission wavelength 425 nm. 
Main mass spectrometer source parameters were following: Capillary 
voltage 0.6 kV, source temperature 120 ◦C, sampling cone voltage 45 V, 
desolvation temperature 350 ◦C, and desolvation gas flow 800 L/Hr. 
2.8. N-terminal sequencing of TrOVA by Edman degradation 
N-terminal sequence analysis of TrOVA was performed on an ABI 
Procise 494 sequencer at Alphalyse A/S (Odense, Denmark) https: 
//www.alphalyse.com. The sample was analyzed on a nitrocellulose 
membrane and loaded onto an acid-etched glass fiber disk. The Edman 
degradation is a cyclic procedure where amino acid residues are cleaved 
off one at a time and identified by chromatography. There are 3 steps in 
the cyclic procedure. In step 1 the PITC reagent was coupled to the N- 
terminal amino group under alkaline conditions. In step 2 the N-terminal 
residue was cleaved in acidic media. In step 3, the PITC coupled residue 
was transferred to a flask, converted to a PTH-residue and identified by 
HPLC chromatography. The next cycle was then started for identifica­
tion of the next N-terminal residue. 
2.9. Techno-functionality analyses 
Emulsifying properties. Emulsions containing 10 % w/w rapeseed oil 
and 90 % w/w aqueous BLG solution were prepared. TrBLG solution 
contained 2.3 mg/mL protein in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer at pH 
6.8. Similarly, bovine BLG standard (Sigma #L3908) was dispersed at 
the concentration 2.3 mg/mL protein in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer 
at pH 6.8. Both TrBLG and bovine BLG solutions were heat-treated at 
90 ◦C, 5 min. prior to emulsification. Heat treatments were performed at 
the protein concentration of 2.3 mg/mL in kimax tubes immersed in a 
water bath at 92 ◦C and kept for 7 min. Afterwards, tubes were imme­
diately immersed in ice water and cooled to room temperature. For 
emulsion preparation, oil and water phases were pre-homogenized by an 
ultraturrax (Silent Crusher M, Heidolph Instruments GmbH, Schwabach, 
Germany) at 20 000 rpm, 1 min followed by high pressure homogeni­
zation (Microfluidics M−110Y, Newton, MA, USA) at 500 bars, 10 min 
circulation of 100 mL total liquid. Oil-in-water emulsions with a protein- 
to-oil ratio of around 1:50 were obtained. Emulsions were divided into 
aliquots and stored at 4 ◦C for up to 30 days undisturbed in glass vials. 
The droplet size distribution was measured by laser diffraction (Mas­
tersizer 3000, Malvern Pananalytical, UK) on day 0 and day 30. Before 
the particle size analysis, emulsions were gently mixed up and down 
inside 50 mL falcon tubes. The size of the oil droplets was analyzed using 
the general-purpose model with refractive indexes of 1.33 and 1.46 for 
the continuous phase and the particles, respectively. The volume- 
weighted geometric mean particle diameter (d4,3) and d10, d50 and 
d90 values were recorded along with particle size distribution. d4,3 and 
span parameters were reported according to equations (1) and (2), 
respectively (Kuhn & Cunha, 2012):

where ni is the number of particles with diameter di and d90, d50, d10

the width of the particle size distribution. 
Two independent batches of fresh emulsions were analyzed with 2–3 
size measurements performed in parallel. The change in particle size 
distribution during storage was used as an indicative of emulsion 
stability. 
Foaming. Foaming properties of TrOVA (partially purified), control 
OVA (A5503 from Sigma), and “Trichoderma background protein” (Tre 
background) samples were determined according to Nisov et al. (2020) 
with slight modifications. Dispersions containing 10 % (w/w) protein at 
pH 6.3 (adjusted using NaOH or HCl) that were prepared by first mixing 
the powdery samples with RO-water for 30 min under magnetic stirring 
followed by pH adjustment and further mixing for 90 min including pH 
readjustment when needed. Foaming was performed by mixing 10 mL of 
sample solution for 90 s with a battery-operated whisker (AeroLatte AL- 
V1-SS Chef Kitchen Whisk, United Kingdom). Foaming properties were 
quantified by calculating foaming capacity (FC), foam stability (FS) 
overnight storage in fridge and drainage (DR) after overnight storage in 
fridge as follows: 
FC (%) = (totalvolumeafter foaming(mL)/initialsamplevolume(mL)x100%   
FSX min (%) = foam volume at X min (mL) / initial foam volume (mL) x 100%   
DRX min (%) = volume of the liquid fraction at X min (mL)
/ initial sample volume (mL) x 100% 
In addition, photographs of the foam structures were taken at 60 
min, 300 min and after overnight storage in fridge. 
Gelation behaviour Dispersions of TrOVA (partially purified), con­
trol OVA (A5503 from Sigma), and “Trichoderma background protein” 
were prepared for the gelation studies in the same way as for the 
foaming studies. Gelation of the dispersions was studied by measuring 
their viscoelastic properties during heating by dynamic oscillatory 
testing with a rheometer (AR-G2, TA Instruments, UK) in a similar 
manner as by Silventoinen et al. (2022) with some modifications. The 
measurements were carried out with a 40 mm cone-plate geometry 
(stainless steel) at a frequency of 0.1 Hz and a strain of 0.005.

Evaporation of water from the sample was prevented by covering the 
edges of the geometry with rapeseed oil. The measurements were started 
at 22 ◦C and the temperature was increased at 5 ◦C/min to 90 ◦C and 
further continued at 90 ◦C for 5 min. As a result, the evolution of storage 
modulus (G’), loss modulus (G’’) and phase angle (δ) over time were 
reported. 
3. Results and discussion 
3.1. Strain engineering, 24-well cultivations, bioreactor cultivations 
3.1.1. 24 Well cultivations of OVA and BLG production strains 
The parental strain M1908 and a selected set of parallel trans­
formants from BLG and OVA expression constructs were first cultured in 
24 well plates to assess the initial production levels of the two proteins 
and for the selection of best producing transformants (Supplementary 
figure 1). Transformants using the cbh1 promoter were cultivated in 
media with lactose as the carbon source, whereas transformants utilizing 
the SES-promoter constructs were cultivated in media with glucose as 
the main carbon source. For BLG, all analyzed transformants from the 
B8053 (cbh1p-BLG) transformation produced BLG (Supplementary table 
1). From the B8050 transformation (SESp-BLG) only one transformant 
(transformant 26) showed BLG production to a level that could be 
detected by SDS-PAGE (Supplementary table 1). 
For OVA expressing transformants, similar cultivations and SDS- 
PAGE analysis was done. For B8054 transformants (cbh1p-OVA), 2 out 
of 4 cultivated transformants produced OVA protein. All four of the 
cultivated B8051 transformants (SESp-OVA) produced OVA. In all 
analysed culture supernatants the OVA protein ran in the SDS-PAGE gel 
as two bands with a size difference of approximately 5 kDa. Two B8054 
OVA production transformants were grown in a 24 well plate with 
protease inhibitors chymostatin and pepstatin, separately, to check if the 
two bands were a result of protease activity and to learn what types of 
proteases were limiting OVA stability. The addition of chymostatin 
stabilized the OVA protein to the size corresponding the full-length OVA 
(Supplementary figure 2). The pepstatin treatment did not result in 
improvement of stability under these conditions. Similar results were 
obtained with B8051 transformants cultivated on glucose. 
These results suggest that there is a chymotrypsin-like protease 
secreted into the culture supernatant that partly degrades OVA protein 
leading to product that is approximately 5 KDa smaller than full length 
OVA protein. It is not yet known for sure which protease this might be, 
but we have previously reported about subtilisin proteases secreted by 
the strain (Landowski et al., 2015, 2016). Once identified, the protease 
or proteases could be removed from the genome to provide a more stable 
product under these conditions. Alternatively, the media or cultivation 
conditions could be modified to reduce or avoid protease expression. For 
example, minimal medium could be used, or the pH value could be 
adjusted. 
The best producing transformant from each expression construct was 
purified and stored in our culture collection with codes M2149, M2144, 
M2151 and M2146 for B8053 transformant 90, B8050 transformant 26, 
B8054 transformant 121 and B8051 transformant 5, respectively (Sup­
plementary table 1). 
3.1.2. TrOVA and TrBLG bioreactor cultivations 
The best production strain for TrOVA and TrBLG, as indicated from 
the 24-well screening studies, were taken forward into small bioreactors 
to evaluate their production ability under controlled conditions. The 
M2144 strain, expressing BLG, was cultivated in a 1 L bioreactor in a 
medium containing yeast extract and glucose. Two major protein bands 
could be seen from the Coomassie stained gel. The upper 50 kDa band 
represents the CBH1 carrier protein used in the expression construct and 
the lower 19 kDa band represents the BLG protein (Fig. 1A). Under these 
conditions the M2144 strain produced 1 g/L of the BLG. There is ex­
pected to be only one expression cassette integrated into cbh1 locus in 
this strain. 
Using the same strain and growing it in lactose and spent grain 
medium, the production level of BLG was 0.8 g/L. Again, as expected, 
the major band was the CBH1 carrier protein above 50 kDa. In this 
medium condition and process, there are more native cellulases and 
hemicellulases secreted into the culture medium as compared to the 
glucose-based process described above. The lactose and spent grain 
medium induce a wide variety of promoters for those native proteins and 
thus this particular medium produces a higher load of background 
proteins. The M2144 strain contains the SES promoter system that 
constitutively transcribes the BLG well under both conditions. One 
advantage of using the SES system is that the BLG can be expressed in

glucose based medium. The sugar glucose typically inhibits the secretion 
of most of the major cellulases and hemicellulases (Rantasalo et al., 
2018), which is a positive feature of the SES system that reduces the 
background proteins present in the culture medium. 
Ideally, the SES system would be preferred in this case to produce the 
BLG at high levels and keep the background proteins in the culture 
medium low. This would reduce the need for extensive downstream 
processing steps to remove the background proteins if this process were 
to be taken forward into commercial development. Also, the CBH1 
carrier protein could potentially be removed from the expression 
construct to avoid having the large amount of CBH1 protein present. It is 
not clear yet, whether the CBH1 carrier is beneficial and necessary to 
production of BLG. The other approach would be to use only a signal 
sequence to try to express BLG in the future. 
The M2146 strain expressing TrOVA was cultivated in a 1 L biore­
actor in a medium containing yeast extract and glucose (Fig. 2A). Two 
major bands at 36 kDa and 42 kDa were seen from the Coomassie stained 
gel. The expression level of these two bands combined was 2 g/L as 
determined by densitometry. This expression system also benefited from 
the glucose repression effect, which resulted in minimal native back­
ground proteins being expressed. The bioreactor culture supernatants 
were then purified to be able to test of the functional properties of the 
proteins. 
3.2. Purification of TrBLG and TrOVA 
Purification of TrBLG. TrBLG was expressed in T. reesei using the 
synthetic promoter system identified as strain M2144 (Supplementary 
Table 1). After changing the buffer of the culture supernatant, it was 
possible to purify the protein with over 95 % purity using a single anion 
exchange chromatography step. Approximately 8.3 g of purified protein 
was obtained from 7.7 L culture supernatant (yield of 1 g/liter). The 
SDS-PAGE analysis revealed the presence of a single band of approx. 17 
kDa having similar molecular mass as bovine control BLG (Fig. 1B), 
which agrees with the calculated molecular weight of 18,281 Da for 
TrBLG. 
Purification of TrOVA. TrOVA was purified from T. reesei culture 
supernatant in which TrOVA was expressed using the synthetic SES 
promoter (identified as strain M2146, Supplementary Table 1) and 
cultivated on media with glucose as the carbon source. SDS-PAGE 
analysis of the TrOVA protein, purified in two chromatographic steps, 
revealed a major band of approximately 36 kDa with an estimated purity 
of 80 % (Fig. 2B). The molecular weight of TrOVA was lower as 
compared to the control OVA, having a molecular weight of approxi­
mately 42 kDa. Moreover, several minor, low-molecular weight bands 
could be observed for the purified TrOVA, all of which, except for the 
band below 10 kDa, were shown to be degradation products of TrOVA 
by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis (data not shown). Although 
OVA lacks protease inhibitory activity, it is a member of the superfamily 
and the founding member of the subgroup called ovalbumin-related 
serpins or clade B serpins. Serpins share a common tertiary structure, 
consisting of nine alpha helices and three beta sheets, along with an 
exposed and highly flexible reactive centre loop that typically serves as 
bait for target proteases. When the reactive centre loop is cleaved a 
dramatic structural conformation change occurs in the serpin and the 
protease is subsequently inactivated by active-site distortion and 
disruption of the entire protease structure (Benarafa & Remold-O’Don­
nell, 2005). 
Chicken OVA has two reported cleavage sites for OVA near this loop 
region. Porcine pancreatic elastase was shown to cut between ALA 353 
and SER 354 and the Carlsberg subtilisin cut between PHE 359 and ARG 
360 (Arii & Hirose, 2002). In our study, the observed 36 kDa (lower 
degradation product) and 42 kDa (full length) bands in the SDS-PAGE 
gel correspond similarly to those bands observed in the literature 
when a subtilisin protease has been active. The N-terminal sequencing of 
the 36 kDa and 42 kDa protein bands, revealed the expected N-terminal 
residues. Thus, the cleavage of the 36 kDa product must have occurred 
from the C-terminal end, further supporting the cleavage sites presented 
in literature. Therefore, Trichoderma proteases may cut in similar posi­
tions in the OVA protein, but this needs to be confirmed in future work. 
Chicken OVA has been shown to contain one disulphide bond and 
four cysteine residues existing as free thiol groups (Huntington & Stein, 
2001). The differences in electrophoretic mobility of the OVA proteins 
between the non-reducing and the reducing conditions of SDS-PAGE 
(Fig. 2B) indicate the presence of a disulphide bridge in both TrOVA 
and control OVA. Under non-reducing conditions, a part of TrOVA 
migrated with the same speed as the reduced TrOVA, resulting in a 
double band. The presence of the SS bridge in the chicken OVA has been 
shown to contribute to the conformational stability (Ishimaru et al., 
2011). 
Selective precipitation was used as a method to purify gram-scale 
amounts of TrOVA for the techno-functional analyses. Addition of 7 % 
NaCl at pH 2 was used as a method to precipitate most of the proteins in 
the culture filtrate while retaining TrOVA in the supernatant. The pu­
rification resulted in loss of several background proteins compared to 
control in lanes (Supplementary figure 3). However, some TrOVA was 
lost in the precipitate (Supplementary figure 3, lane 4). Altogether 32 g 
of TrOVA was purified having a purity of approximately 47 % in this 
study. 
3.3. Molecular structure characterization 
Secondary structure by circular dichroism. Secondary structures of 
TrBLG and TrOVA were analyzed by far-UV CD analysis at native and 
denaturing conditions. Protein solutions were heated in the cuvette up 
to 90 ◦C and cooled back to 25 ◦C. Secondary structural motifs of TrBLG 
and TrOVA were compared to those of control BLG and control OVA, 
respectively.The CD spectra of TrBLG showed at room temperature, a

separate chromatographic runs; lane 9, control OVA 
(2.5 µg). The samples in lanes 2–4 were boiled for 5 
min in sample buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol 
whereas the samples in lane 7–9 where prepared 
without boiling and without β-mercaptoethanol.   
N. Aro et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     

Food Research International 163 (2023) 112131

wide minimum at around 216 nm, typical of predominantly β-sheet 
structure (Fig. 3A). Negative peak shifts toward 205 nm with heating 
indicated loss of β-sheets and α-helices and increase in random coil 
structures. Similar secondary structural features were observed for both 
TrBLG and control bovine BLG (Fig. 3A-C). Correctly folded BLG vari­
ants were expressed in E.coli previously (Keppler et al., 2021; Ponniah 
et al., 2010). The CD spectra of TrOVA at room temperature demon­
strated a typical CD spectrum of a α-helical protein having two negative 
bands at 208 and 222 nm and a positive band at 193 nm (Fig. 3D). 
Despite the presence of degradation bands in the purified TrOVA sam­
ple, the secondary structural features appear surprisingly similar to 
control OVA. Upon heating and cooling back the sample to room tem­
perature, some small differences in the CD spectra of TrOVA and control 
OVA could be observed, suggesting minor conformational differences to 
occur in the two proteins (Fig. 3D-F). 
Glycosylation of proteins. Glycosylation and other structural char­
acteristics from released N-glycan analysis (Fig. 4) observed that com­
mercial bovine lactoglobulin, as expected, and TrBLG are both almost 
completely non-glycosylated (Fig. 4A). A small amount of mannose 5 is 
observed in TrBLG under these conditions. TrBLG was glycosylated 
mostly with mannose containing five sugar units (Fig. 4B), with smaller 
contribution from mannoses having higher amount of sugar units. The 
finding that mannose with five sugars was the dominating glycan is in 
line with the previous findings with glycosylation by Trichoderma reesei 
(Stals et al., 2004). Targeted glycosylation of BLG has been previously 
shown to impact the functional properties of the protein, but compared 
to T. reesei -driven glycosylation, the degree of glycosylation has been 
clearly higher (Jim´enez-Casta˜no et al., 2007; Van Teeffelen et al., 2005). 
The glycosylation degree of TrOVA was not studied in the present 
work, but it’s expected that the degree and quality of glycosylation is 
similar to TrBLG, since it can be expected to follow the similar pattern of 
T. reesei. However, it should be noted that, compared to non- 
glycosylated bovine BLG, the chicken OVA is already originally N-gly­
cosylated with mannose-backbone glycans (Harvey et al., 2000), and 
thus, the T. reesei -driven glycosylation is expected to occur. 
3.4. Techno-functional properties 
Emulsifying properties of TrBLG were compared to that of control 
BLG from bovine. The emulsions were prepared at a protein concen­
tration of 2.3 mg/mL, 90:10 water:oil ratio using a high-pressure ho­
mogenizer. The protein solutions were heat-treated at 90 ◦C, 5 min prior 
to emulsion preparation in order to expose partial denaturation of BLG 
molecules which, depending on concentration and heating conditions, 
improve the emulsifying properties (Dissanayake & Vasiljevic, 2009). In 
appearance, both TrBLG and control BLG provided white, highly stable 
emulsions that showed no visible signs of phase separation after 30 days 
storage at 4 ◦C (Fig. 5). Both emulsions showed polymodal size distri­
butions on day 0 with volume-based mean particle diameter (d4,3) 
values of 2 µm and 1 µm for TrBLG and bovine BLG emulsions, 
Fig. 3. CD spectra of TrBLG and control BLG (A-C) and TrOVA and control OVA (D-F). The spectra were recorded from 260 to 190 nm in 20 mM Na-phosphate buffer, 
pH 6.8 at 25 ◦C, 90 ◦C and then cooled back to 25 ◦C.

respectively (Table 1). Emulsions prepared with control BLG showed a 
wider particle size span of 5.6 compared to that of TrBLG which was 2.5 
at day 0. Accordingly, both emulsions were composed of particles with a 
wide size distribution ranging between < 0.1 μm - < 10 μm. The reason 
for the wide range is most probably related to the emulsification con­
ditions used which were fixed at a pressure of 500 bars for the duration 
of 10 min. Harsh emulsification conditions may have resulted in partial 
coalescence of nano-sized oil droplets leading large size spans (Kuhn & 
Cunha, 2012). Differences between particle size distributions of TrBLG 
and control BLG from bovine indicate differences in emulsifying activity 
of the two proteins to some degree. This indirectly designates minute 
structural differences between TrBLG and control BLG after exposure to 
pre-heating. 
During storage, both emulsions showed narrowing of the size dis­
tribution with span values coming down to 1.8 and 0.8 for TrBLG and 
control BLG, respectively (Table 1). d4,3 values, however, did not differ 
dramatically compared to day 0. Both emulsions were stable over 30 
days storage as was observed inside glass vials (Fig. 5). Similarly, sam­
ples stored in falcon tubes for particle size analysis did not show and 
visible phase separation, thus gentle shaking was performed before size 
measurements. It can be inferred that initially formed droplets reor­
ganized in time into monomodal distributions with smaller span values. 
Overall, TrBLG showed good emulsifying properties similar to control 
BLG from bovine indicating that it may serve as an alternative to animal- 
based whey protein ingredients. Similar results were shown recently by 
Keppler et al. (2021) for recombinant BLG proteins produced in E. coli. 
Recombinant BLGs showed minor differences in structural and physico- 
chemical properties to that of bovine BLG variants. Their emulsifying 
properties regarding droplet size and creaming behavior were similar to 
that of bovine BLG. 
Foaming and gel formation properties of TrOVA. Foaming and gel 
formation properties of TrOVA samples were compared with a com­
mercial OVA control sample. In addition to the concentrated TrOVA 
sample also the Trichoderma background proteins (Tre background) 
sample was analysed for foaming and gelation. Both the concentrated 
TrOVA and the OVA control sample showed high foaming capacities 
(FC) of 470 and 560 % (Table 2), respectively, while the Tre background 
formed almost no foam (FC 15 %). This proves that the other proteins 
produced by T. reesei do not participate in the foam formation, but the 
effect is based on the OVA protein. Likewise, the visual appearance of 
the TrOVA and OVA control samples was similar (Supplementary 
Figure 4). Separation of liquid from the foam phase was almost imme­
diate for the Tre background and reached also 70 % for the commercial 
OVA sample already at 60 min, while the foam from the TrOVA was 
more resistant to phase separation (drainage at 60 min 10 %; data not 
shown). The foam stability was also higher for the TrOVA sample at 300 
min (97 %) when compared with the OVA control (29 %; data not 
shown). The TrOVA sample remained very stable even after overnight 
storage in the fridge with a drainage value of only 35 % and foam sta­
bility of 94 %. The higher foam stability of the TrOVA sample when 
compared with the OVA control may results from the improved surface 
activity and stabilising properties of the OVA protein itself or from the 
presence of a higher amount of non-protein components in the TrOVA 
sample increasing the viscosity of the continuous liquid phase around 
the air bubbles and thus retarding the phase separation. The presence of 
smaller OVA fragments from the partial TrOVA degradation could also 
have contributed to the foam stabilization, since peptides are amphi­
philic molecules known to adsorb to air–water, oil–water, or solid-water 
interfaces with subsequent foam stabilization. Overall, adsorption and 
rearrangement of OVA at air–water interphase is highly sensitive to any 
changes in native molecular structure which determines the conforma­
tion transitions at the adsorbed state and subsequent foaming properties 
(Jin et al., 2022). Additionally, it should be noted that T. reesei is known 
to produce native hydrophobin proteins (Vereman et al., 2019) and 
since TrOVA was not fully purified, it could be postulated that the small 
amounts of native hydrophobin protein present in the TrOVA prepara­
tion could have contributed to foam stabilization as shown previously 
for food foams (Cox et al., 2009). 
In the gelation study it was demonstrated that the TrOVA sample was 
able to form a relatively strong gel upon heating to 90 ◦C. The final 
storage modulus (G’), a measure of the gel strength, of the formed 
TrOVA gel (570 Pa) was however an order of magnitude lower than that 
of the control OVA gel (5700 Pa) (Table 2). Tre background also formed 
a gel, but the final G’ of that gel was very low (19 Pa). The rheological 
properties of heat-induced hen OVA gels are known to be very much 
dependent on protein concentration, pH, presence of salts and heating/

cooling temperature and rate (Arntfield et al., 1990a, 1990b; Arntfield & 
Murray, 1992; Van Kleef, 1986), so direct comparisons to previous 
studies are difficult, but G’ values in the range 500–10 000 Pa have been 
reported for heat-induced hen OVA gels after cooling to room temper­
ature at a protein concentration (10 %) comparable to our study 
(Arntfield & Murray, 1992; Van Kleef, 1986; Weijers et al., 2002). We 
followed the gelation only until heating to 90 ◦C and reported the G’ 
values after a 5 min holding time at 90 ◦C, but would expect to see a 
further increase in G’ during cooling. In our experiments, the pH and 
total protein concentration were fixed to the same level for all samples, 
but there were differences in the protein composition and possibly also 
in the concentration and type of salts present in the matrix. The TrOVA 
sample contained, in addition to intact TrOVA, also some background 
proteins (possibly hydrophobin) and partially degraded TrOVA protein, 
which may have reduced the G’ of the TrOVA gels as compared to the 
control OVA. 
When taking a closer look at the gelation kinetics (Supplementary 
Figure 5), it was noticed that the gelation of TrOVA occurred in two 
phases. A first transition point, with a great increase in G’ and G’’, was 
noticed between 55 ◦C and 60 ◦C and a second one at about 75 ◦C. The 
transition (gelation) points for Tre background and control OVA were 
observed at 59 ◦C and 74 ◦C, respectively. This indicates that the first 
transition point of the TrOVA sample could originate mainly from 
gelation of the background proteins and the second one from gelation of 
OVA proteins. This is in agreement with previous studies, in which 
denaturation of hen OVA has been reported to occur in the temperature 
range 70–80 ◦C (Arntfield & Murray, 1992; Broersen et al., 2006; 
Weijers et al., 2003). 
4. Conclusions 
This study showed that BLG and OVA proteins can be produced by 
T. reesei, showing the potential of precision fermentation for the food 
ingredient industry. We were able to create production the first- 
generation production strains capable of producing 1 g/L of BLG and 
2 g/L OVA without major strain or bioprocess optimization. Yet, to be 
commercially competitive for industrial use, the production levels 
would need to be increased probably over 20 times, which could be 
accomplished through more advanced strain and bioprocess develop­
ment work. Further, the produced proteins showed techno-functional 
properties relevant to food industry. TrBLG formed stable emulsion 
similarly to bovine BLG at a low protein-to-oil ratio of around 1:50, and 
TrOVA showed superior foaming activity compared to hen OVA. How­
ever, the partial degradation of TrOVA or presence of background host 
proteins might have contributed to lower gel strength compared to 
chicken OVA. Solutions to improve TrOVA stability and purity should be 
developed both at production and down-stream processing levels.
