To the union of two people 
Weathering life's storms together 
Watching the lightning 
Waiting for the thunder 
In friendship, In partnership 
In love
To the Memory of 
Our Friend and Colleague
Gilles de Saint Seine 
Process Engineer 
Total-Fina-Elf, France
It’s more than losing a friend, it seems as if  
Liz and I have lost part of ourselves, but we  
will always remember his gentle determination  
and insightful work, his love of family and  
consideration for his colleagues, and not least  
his marvelous wit.
This book is dedicated to our parents:
Elizabeth and Tom Holmes, innovative engineers, 
 courageous under fire at war and in peace.
Mary and Lou Lieberman whose enduring strength and 
fortitude have been little noted, but long remembered.

Foreword
T
he forest has largely reclaimed the Amoco Refinery in Destre-
han, Louisiana. A large sugar maple sprouts from a long since 
forgotten control room. If one didn’t know, the delayed coker 
drum structure might be mistaken for a ruined temple. Brick chimney 
stacks rise defiantly above the feathery tops of the cypress trees.
The process vessels were uprooted in 1955 and shipped to the 
Amoco Refinery in Texas City. Odd bits of piping and valves have 
sunk into the swamp. A half century of gentle, but persistent effort by 
Mother Nature has partly reclaimed this bit of earth for the natural 
world.
The area is fenced and closed to the public. Well test points dot 
the fence line. After 50 years, someone is still monitoring the ground 
water seepage for escaping aromatics and other cancer-causing 
chemicals. I’ve hiked through this area a dozen times. Never have I 
seen a rabbit or a snake or an alligator or a nutria or a deer. The large 
pond in the center of the site is devoid of fish, turtles, and frogs.
Some day soon—in 20 years or 100 years—the Mississippi River, 
which flows just across the River Road, will breach its levee and clean 
up this mess. Or nature may get really angry and toss the Gulf of 
Mexico over Destrehan with a category 5 hurricane. It’s only a matter 
of time.
Same with the other problem. CO2 is increasing at 2 ppm a year. 
Another 3 or 4°F will make large parts of the earth uninhabitable. 
Exploitation of heavy hydrocarbon deposits in Alberta and Venezuela 
can only increase the 2 ppm CO2 growth rate. This can go on for 
another 20 years or another 100 years. Then Mother Nature will take 
serious corrective action to restore natural equilibrium. It’s only a 
matter of time.
What can you do? A few ideas:
•	 Close hand valves on steam turbines
•	 Reduce pump impeller sizes
•	 Suction throttle compressors rather than spillback recycle gas
xvii

xviii 
F o r e w o r d
•	 Minimize tower pressure to maximize relative volatility and 
minimize reflux rates
•	 Keep gas-fired turbine rotors clean
•	 Avoid afterburn in heater convective sections
•	 Don’t justify new projects to replace existing equipment that 
just needs maintenance
•	 Read this book
Sooner, rather than later, nature may get really angry and elimi-
nate the fundamental problem. Time is not on our side.

uried deep in our genetic heritage, hidden in an obscure string 
of DNA, is coding for Process Equipment Operations. An 
instinctive desire to apply energy to transmute the properties 
of naturally occurring materials into other, more useful forms. Like 
cooking food; or fusing clay into ceramic pots; or reacting sulfur with 
air to produce sulfuric acid; or transmuting lead to gold.
Looking back on 50 years as a process engineer, the most satisfy-
ing period of my career was devoted to converting gas oil into vis-
cous polypropylene via cracking reactions and refrigeration.
The gene that codes for operation and design of process equip-
ment, such as distillation columns and fired heaters, is a recessive 
gene. Only one out of 40 individuals have inherited this genetic code 
for process equipment operations as a dominant trait.
Should you wish to determine if your child has inherited this 
genetic makeup for process equipment operations, observe if the 
child:
·	 Is fascinated by fire
·	 Tries to dam and divert little streams
·	 Is attracted by boiling water
·	 Asks what makes a windmill turn
Thus, only one out of 40 people have the potential to evolve into 
process engineers or operators. The rest will become Directors of 
Human Resources or Maintenance Superintendents. 
My older sister often asks, “Norman. You’re over 72. When are 
you going to retire? You’re too old to be climbing distillation towers. 
You’ll fall off one of these days.”
“Arline,” I explain, “I can’t retire. It’s in my blood.”

P r e f a c e  t o  t h e  F o u r t h  E d i t i o n 
“Norman, you’re crazy! Everyone else in our family retired in 
their 60s. It couldn’t be in your blood. Dad moved to a retirement 
village when he was only 62.”
“You don’t understand, Arline. It’s a recessive gene I inherited 
from our ancestors generations ago. I can’t retire. It’s part of my DNA. 
It’s instinctive behavior. Like a beaver building a dam. Or squirrels 
gathering nuts in the fall. I can’t retire. I’ll just have to go on until 
the end.”

hen I feel a gentle breeze cool against my skin, I think about 
the sun causing uneven heating of the earth’s surface. Hot 
air rises; cool air rushes into the area of lower air density. 
Thus the wind.
When I see a sparkling stream cascading in silver bubbles over 
rounded pebbles, my thoughts drift to converting potential energy 
to kinetic energy. Our visit to the lovely wine country of the Sonoma 
Valley awoke within me memories of the early days of spirit 
distillation.
A wax candle was burning in a remote church we visited in 
England. How many candles would be burned to heat the air in the 
church by 10°F? Knowing the heat of combustion of wax and the spe-
cific heat of air, I could and did calculate that 68 candles would be 
consumed.
A child’s brightly colored pinwheel spinning in the wind creates an 
irresistible urge to discourse on steam turbines. A pot of pasta boiling 
over on our stove is the perfect incentive to deliver a lecture, which no 
one wants to hear, detailing foam-induced flooding in packed towers. 
Suntanned skin is the perfect example illustrating the power of radiant 
heat transfer.
I quite realize that normal people do not have such thoughts rac-
ing continuously through their minds. I can’t help myself. It’s a con-
sequence of being a process engineer for too long.
For 43 years I’ve been worrying and pondering about how process 
equipment works. For half a century I’ve been seeking enlightenment 
about mysteries of nature!
•	 What causes thermosyphon circulation in reboilers?
•	 How can a positive pressure develop in a natural draft-fired 
heater?
xxi

xxii 
P r e f a c e  t o  t h e  T h i r d  E d i t i o n 
•	 What causes surge in centrifugal compressors?
•	 Why do two identical condensers, working in parallel, per-
form entirely differently?
•	 What are the hand valves on a steam turbine all about?
•	 How exactly does reflux improve product separation?
•	 Why is the seal flush pressure to a centrifugal pump the 
suction rather than the discharge pressure?
•	 What affects tray efficiency in distillation?
•	 Why do reciprocating compressors have adjustable unloaders?
•	 How can the liquid level in a drum of boiling water be 
measured?
•	 Can the oil temperature inside a pipe be measured based on 
the exterior pipe temperature?
•	 Why do some heat exchangers suddenly seem to clean 
themselves?
Maybe if Liz and I write all this down, I can stop thinking about 
these questions. We tried to do so in our first two editions, but failed. 
I’m still wondering and worrying. So once again we will try in this 
third edition of A Working Guide to Process Equipment: How Process 
Equipment Works. If you have questions, contact us at:

Preface to the  
Second Edition
Dear Aunt Hilda:
I hope this letter finds you well and in good spirits. How is Uncle 
Herb?
Incidentally, I am not a drug dealer. My mother, I fear, has told 
you that I make a lot of money in drugs. I sometimes consult on 
process engineering problems for pharmaceutical companies—but 
I do not deal drugs.
I know my mother told you about the drugs because she doesn’t 
understand what Liz and I do. Also, she’s still disappointed that  
I didn’t become a doctor. I’ve explained what a process engineer does 
to Mom a hundred times. Let me try to explain it to you.
First, Aunt Hilda, process equipment is all around us:
• Gas burner in an oven
• Steam radiator
• Vacuum cleaner
• Sump pump in your basement
• Central air conditioning
• Hot water heater
• Toilet water closet
• Refrigerator
Our job is to design improvements to existing process equipment. 
To do this we do three things:
• Investigate the current operation of the process equipment in 
oil refineries and chemical plants. Based on field data, what 
are the actual operating parameters of a process plant?
xxiii

xxiv 
P r e f a c e  t o  t h e  S e c o n d  E d i t i o n 
• What are the design or theoretical operating parameters of 
the plant?
• What is causing the plant to perform below its theoretical 
efficiency and what shall be done to correct the deficiency?
To be successful, Liz and I have to understand in a fundamental 
way how the equipment actually works. It’s true that I do a lot of work 
with centrifugal refrigeration compressors. However, contrary to what 
my mother told Mrs. Goldberg, I am not a Frigidaire repairman.
I hope this letter explains what I’ve been doing for the past 40 years. 
I definitely do not regret not becoming a doctor. I’m enclosing a copy of 
our book, A Working Guide to Process Equipment: How Process Equipment 
Works, for you and Uncle Herb. This really explains what process 
equipment is all about in a pretty simple way.
I think you would agree that an important company like McGraw-
Hill would not publish such a book if they thought that I was a drug 
dealer. We’ll see you, God willing, at the wedding in June.
All our love,
Norm and Liz Lieberman

Preface to the  
First Edition
November 1, 1996
Subject: How Process Equipment Works
Dear Reader:
Thank you for buying our book. We worked very hard writing it, and 
we appreciate your vote of confidence.
No normal person is going to read this book for fun or relaxation. 
It is a work book, for working people. You purchased it with the hope 
and faith that it can help you do a better job. You opened it with the 
expectation that you can read it with comprehension.
Well, we won’t let you down. But, let’s make a deal. We promise 
you that even though this is a technical book, you can read it easily, 
without pain, but with comprehension. After you read it, you will 
definitely be a better process operator or engineer. Your part of the 
deal is to read the whole book. This is not a reference or source book. 
All the chapters are tied together by threads of logic. You will really 
find it easier to grasp this logic if you read the chapters in sequence.
A few of the words in the text are italicized. These words are 
explained in the Glossary at the back of the book.
Please feel free to give us a call if there is some point you would 
like to discuss, or a process question you wish to ask.
Sincerely,
Norm Lieberman
Chemical Engineer

Introduction
I
n 1983, I started teaching a three-day process equipment trouble-
shooting seminar to chemical engineers and experienced plant 
operators in the petroleum refining and chemical process indus-
try. Since the inception of the seminar, in excess of 7000 men and 
women have attended the classes. The seminar is largely based on my 
40 years’ experience in field troubleshooting and process unit revamp 
design.
I have taught hundreds of seminars explaining how pumps, com-
pressors, heat exchangers, distillation towers, steam jets, fired heaters, 
and steam turbines malfunction. I have explained to thousands of 
chemical engineers how to design trays and modify tube bundles for 
improved performance. More thousands of operators have listened to 
me expound as to how and why cavitation damages pump mechani-
cal seals. And throughout these lectures, one common thread has 
emerged.
The general knowledge as to how process equipment really func-
tions is disappearing from the process industries. This is not only my 
opinion but the general view of senior technical managers in many 
large corporations.
Chemical process equipment is basically the same now as it 
was in the 1930s. The trays, K.O. drums, compressors, heaters, 
steam systems have not changed—and probably will not change. 
The fundamental nature of process equipment operation has been 
well established for a very long time. Modern methods of com-
puter control and process design have not, and cannot, change the 
basic performance of the bulk of process equipment. These tools 
just have made learning about the working of the equipment more 
difficult.
The chemical engineer has traditionally been the guardian of 
process knowledge. So, one would suppose that if fundamental pro-
cess knowledge is vanishing, the origin of the problem may lie in 
our universities. Perhaps there is less of that “hands-on approach” 
xxvii

I n t r o d u c t i o n
to problems with the advent of the PC or perhaps there are just 
fewer people around to teach us. No one really knows.
But in this book, we have gone back to the very simplest basis for 
understanding process equipment. In every chapter we have said, 
“Here is how the equipment behaves in the field, and this is why.” We 
have shown how to do simple technical calculations. The guiding idea 
of our book is that it is better to have a working knowledge of a few 
simple ideas than a superficial knowledge of many complex theoretical 
subjects.
The original three-day troubleshooting seminar has now grown 
into a six-day course that only covers about 50 percent of the subjects 
I tackled in the three-day class. Why? Because it is no longer primar-
ily a troubleshooting seminar. The vast majority of the class time is 
now devoted to explaining how the equipment really functions and 
answering the following sorts of questions:
• Why do trays weep?
• Why do weeping trays have a low tray efficiency?
• What does tray efficiency actually mean anyway?
• Is there a way to design trays that do not weep?
• Why should an operator need to know why trays weep?
• Can a tray weep, even though the computer calculation says 
the tray cannot weep?
Several years ago I began to make notes of the questions most 
frequently asked by my clients and students. Sometimes, it seems as 
if I have been asked and have responded to every conceivable process 
equipment question that could possibly be asked. Certainly, I have 
had plenty of practice in forming my answers, so that they are com-
prehensible to most process personnel, maintenance people, and 
even management. We have tried to summarize these questions and 
answers in this book.
Like everybody else, I have answered questions without always 
being correct. But over the years, I have continued to learn. I have been 
taught by the source of all wisdom and knowledge—the process equip-
ment itself. I am still learning. So you could say that this book is a pro-
gress report of what I have learned so far. I think that my troubleshoot-
ing field work and revamp designs have acted as a filter. This filter has 
removed, and still is removing, from my store of knowledge misconcep-
tions as to the true nature of process equipment functions.
You do not need a technical degree to read and understand this 
text. Certainly this is a technical book. But the math and science dis-
cussed is high school math and science. We have traded precision for 
simplicity in crafting this book.

Liz and I would be happy to discuss any questions you might 
have pertaining to the process equipment discussed in our book. You 
can phone or fax us in the United States at:
Phone: (504) 887-7714
FAX: (504) 456-1835
But if you call us with a question, my first response is likely to be, 
“Have you looked the problem over in the field?”

Acknowledgments
Fortunately for us there are those who benevolently accept that stu-
dents, just like children, are always with you.
The authors gratefully acknowledge the most kind and generous 
support of J. F. Richardson (JFR), in the production of the second edi-
tion, and also the timely assistance provided by R. P. Chhabra (Raj), 
J. Hearle (Jonathan), and J. R. Condor. The areas of this book dealing 
with fluid flow in pipes and hazardous pipe work would have been 
impoverished without their help and guidance.
My days at the University College Swansea (South Wales, UK), 
both during undergraduate years and at times since then when I have 
had the need or opportunity to revisit, are very special to me. The 
college and its staff have provided a rock-steady foundation for 
everything that comes my way as an itinerant Chemical Engineer 
alongside my coauthor Norman.
I will never forget the experience of working (quite literally) in 
the field with JFR, Raj, and Jonathan: sometimes paddling through 
inches of china clay slurry in an isolated pump house, or tracking 
down vent valves for pressure readings on a cross-country pipeline 
that traversed several miles in the heart of Cornwall (UK). 
That hands-on training and field work, just as it should be, was 
very much part of the academic work of the thriving Chemical Engi-
neering Department at the University College Swansea. We have to 
thank late Prof. J. F. Richardson for that, and we hope that his concept 
will live on and grow as a model to us all in his absence.

CHAPTER  1
Process Equipment 
Fundamentals
I 
couldn’t help but notice that the blue fish was permanently 
dead. Most sadly, it was floating on its side. The cause of death 
was clear. The water circulation through the aquarium filter had 
slowed to a thin trickle. Both the red and silvery striped fish also 
appeared ill. I cleaned the filter, but the water flow failed to increase.
As you can see from Fig. 1.1, the filter is elevated above the water 
level in the fish tank. Water is lifted up, out of the tank, and into the 
elevated filter. Water flowing up through the riser tube is filtered, and 
then the clean water flows back into the aquarium.
I tried increasing the air flow just a bit to the riser tube. The water 
began to gurgle and gush happily through the filter. Encouraged, I 
increased the air flow a little more, and the gush diminished back to 
a sad trickle.
It was too bad about the blue fish. It was too bad that I didn’t 
understand about the air, or the filter, or the water flow. It was really 
bad because I have a master’s degree in chemical engineering. It was 
bad because I was the technical manager of the process division of the 
Good Hope Refinery in Louisiana. Mostly, it was bad because I had 
been designing process equipment for 16 years, and didn’t under-
stand how water circulated through my son’s aquarium.
Maybe they had taught this at my university, and I had been 
absent the day the subject was covered? Actually, it wouldn’t have 
mattered. Absent or present, it would be the same. If Professor 
Peterson had covered the subject, I would not have understood it, or 
I would have forgotten it, or both. After all, “Universities are great 
storehouses of knowledge. Freshmen enter the university knowing a 
little, and leave knowing nothing. Thus, knowledge remains behind 
and accumulates.”
But then I realized that I had seen all this before. Six years before, 
in 1974, I had been the operating superintendent of a sulfuric acid 
regeneration plant in Texas City. Acid was lifted out of our mix tank 
by injecting nitrogen into the bottom of a 2-inch riser pipe. The shift 
operators called it an “air lift pump.”

C h a p t e r  O n e
The problem was that in 1974 I didn’t understand how the acid 
air lift pump worked either. More nitrogen pumped more acid. That’s 
all we knew in Texas City, and all we cared to know.
Thinking about Texas City and my university days, my thoughts 
drifted to an earlier time. Back before my high school days in Brooklyn. 
Back to my childhood and to memories of my yellow balloon. The bal-
loon was full of helium and I lost it. The balloon escaped because it was 
lighter than air. It floated up, up, and away because the helium inside 
the balloon was less dense than air. The yellow balloon was lifted into 
the sky because of the density difference between the low molecular 
weight helium inside the balloon, and the higher molecular weight of 
the surrounding sea of air.
So that’s what makes an air lift pump work; density difference. 
Density difference between the lighter air–water mixture in the riser 
tube and the more dense water in the fish tank.
In Fig. 1.1, the pressure at point A will be greater than the pres-
sure at point B. It’s true that the height of liquid in the riser tube is 
triple the height of water in the tank. But because of the bubbles of air 
in the riser tube, the density of the mixed phase fluid in the riser is 
small compared to the density of water. The pressure difference 
between point A and point B is called the “airlift pump driving force.” 
Water flows from an area of higher hydrostatic head pressure (at A) 
to an area of less hydrostatic head pressure (at B). Using more air 
reduces the density in the riser tube. This lowers the pressure at 
point B. The differential pressure between A and B increases.

The greater driving force then increases water flow through the 
aquarium’s filter.
This still leaves a problem. Why did the second increment of air 
flow reduce the rate of water circulation?
1.1  Frictional Losses
We used to make wooden knives in Brooklyn, New York, by rubbing 
a stick on the sidewalk. The wood never got too sharp, but it did get 
hot. Sometimes it even smelled smoky when I rubbed the wood fast 
enough. More speed, more friction. Friction makes heat.
When the air–water mixture flows up through the riser tube, the 
potential energy (meaning the height of the circulating water) 
increases. The energy to supply this extra potential energy comes from 
the pressure difference between point A and point B. Some of the air 
lift pump driving force is converted into potential energy.
Unfortunately, some of the airlift pump driving force is also con-
verted to frictional losses. The friction is caused by the speed of the 
air–water mixture racing up through the riser tube. More air means 
more flow and greater velocities, which means more friction. Too 
much air makes too much friction, which means less of the air lift 
pump driving force is left for increasing the potential energy of the 
water flowing up into the filter. At some point, increasing the air flow 
reduces water flow up the riser due to an increased riser tube pres-
sure drop because of friction.
1.2  Density Difference Induces Flow
I’d better phone Professor Peterson to apologize. I just now remem-
bered that we did learn about this concept that density difference 
between two columns of fluid causes flow. Professor Peterson taught 
us the idea in the context of draft in a fired heater. Cold combustion air 
flows through the burners and is heated by the burning fuel. The hot 
flue gas flows up the stack. The difference in density between the less 
dense hot flue gas and the more dense cold air creates a pressure imbal-
ance called draft. Just like the fish tank story.
However, I can’t call Professor Peterson. He’s dead. I wouldn’t 
call him anyway. I know what he would say: “Lieberman, the anal-
ogy between the air lift pump and draft in a fired heater is obvious to 
the perceptive mind, which apparently excludes you.”
1.3  Natural Thermosyphon Circulation
I worked as a process design engineer for Amoco Oil in Chicago until 
1980. Likely, I designed about 50 distillation columns, 90 percent of 
which had horizontal, natural thermosyphon circulation reboilers. 

	
4	
C h a p t e r  O n e
I saw hundreds of such reboilers in Amoco’s many refineries. I never 
stopped to think what caused the liquid to circulate through the 
reboilers. I never thought about it, even though the reboiler feed noz-
zle on the tower was below the vapor return nozzle. Now, with my 
fish tank experience as a guide, I was able to understand:
• The reboiler shell is like the fish tank.
• The reboiler vapor is like the air.
• The reboiler return pipe is like the riser tube.
• The distillation tower is like the filter.
Every Saturday I run for 6 miles along the levee bordering the 
Mississippi River in New Orleans. Huge sand hills lie between the 
levee and the river. The sand has been dredged from the river bed 
by the Army Corps of Engineers. The Corps uses 30-inch diameter 
flexible hoses to suck the sand from the river bed. Maybe the con-
cept of “sand sucking” is not the most elegant terminology? To be 
precise, a barge floating on the river, equipped with an air compres-
sor, discharges air to the bottom of the 30-inch hose, 140 ft below the 
surface. The reduced density inside the hose, due to the compressed 
air, creates an area of low pressure at the bottom of the hose. The 
water and sand are then drawn into the area of low pressure and up 
the hose, which empties the sand and water into a basin along the 
riverbank. You can see a geyser of water and sand spurting up in 
these sand basins. I made a mini-dredge like that to suck the sand 
out of my pool sand filter. It worked rather well, until the little air 
compressor motor began smoking.
1.4  Reducing Hydrocarbon Partial Pressure
One day my mother served me a bowl of mushroom soup which I 
didn’t want to eat. I disliked mushroom soup, but I was a practical 
child. It would serve no purpose to tell my mother I hated the taste of 
mushrooms because she would say, “I’ve spent all day cooking. 
You’re not going outside till you eat that soup.” So I said, “Mom, the 
soup is too hot. I’ll burn my tongue.” And she said, “Norman, blow 
across the soup to cool it off.” While I knew this would cool the soup, 
I really didn’t like mushrooms. So I responded, “Mom, why will 
blowing across the soup cool it off? How does that work?”
At this point your typical mother would slap the kid in the head 
and say, “Children in Europe are starving (this was in 1947; now 
European children are overweight). Shut up and eat your soup.” But 
not my mother. “Norman, blowing across the soup blows away the 
molecules of steam covering the top of the soup. This makes room for 
more molecules of water to escape from the surface of the soup in the 
form of steam. When the molecules of water are changed into molecules 

	
P r o c e s s  E q u i p m e n t  F u n d a m e n t a l s 	
5
of steam, that takes a lot of heat. This heat is called latent heat. This 
latent heat does not come from your breath, which is colder than the 
soup. The heat to vaporize the soup comes from the hot soup itself. 
The temperature of the soup is called sensible heat. When you blow 
across the soup, you’re helping the sensible heat content of the soup 
to be converted to latent heat of evaporation of the soup. And that’s 
why the soup cools. But your breath simply acts as a carrier—to carry 
away the molecules of steam covering the surface of the soup.”
And I said, “What?”
And Mom said, “Norman, in effect, your breath is reducing the 
partial pressure of steam in contact with the soup. For every one 
weight percent of evaporation, the soup will cool by 10ºF.”
If my mother had served me a hydrocarbon soup, then for every 
one weight percent of evaporation, the soup would have cooled by 
2ºF. Then she would have said the carrier gas or stripping steam 
would be reducing the hydrocarbon partial pressure.
I have designed process equipment where the carrier medium is 
the air. Sometimes we use nitrogen or hydrogen. But mainly we use 
steam because it’s cheap and condensable. We use steam:
• in the feed to towers.
• as the stripping medium in steam strippers.
• in evaporators.
The steam is used to promote vaporization of the product. But the 
heat of vaporization does not come from the steam, it comes mainly 
from the product itself. This is true even if the steam is superheated.
As an adult, I grow my own mushrooms on logs and consume them 
quite happily. Mom’s gone now, and I would give a lot for a bowl of her 
mushroom soup. But I still remember the lesson about the reduction in 
partial pressure and the conversion of sensible heat to latent heat. 
1.5  Corrosion at Home
My mother always thought that I was a genius. She would tell all the 
other mothers in our neighborhood, “You should have your daughter 
meet my son, he’s a genius.”  My mother decided that I was a genius 
based on one incident that happened when I was six years old. She 
called me into the bathroom. “Norman! Look at the sink.” The sink 
was discolored by brown, rusty stains from the old pipes in our 
ancient apartment house. 
“Mom, I think my sister did that. It’s not my fault. It’s Arlene’s fault.”
“Norman, no one is blaming you for the stains. Stop blaming 
Arlene. What I want is for you to get the stains off.”
So I went into the kitchen, got a bottle of Coke, poured it over the 
stains, and the sink became clean. From this single incident, my mother 

	
6	
C h a p t e r  O n e
decided I was a genius and that all the teenage girls in south Brooklyn 
should fall in love with me. Actually, I went out with one of those 
girls—Gloria Harris. I really liked her. But she dumped me. Gloria 
told her mother that I was just another nerd.
What was it about the Coke that removed the iron deposits from 
our sink? It was carbonic acid (H2CO3). (Coke contains lots of phos-
phoric and citric acid too.)
Carbonic acid is formed when CO2 dissolves under pressure in 
water. The resulting acid has a 5 to 6 pH, even at relatively high acidic 
concentrations. The acid readily dissolves iron to form water-soluble 
iron carbonate, Fe(HCO3).
This is a problem in process plant steam heaters. There are always 
some residual carbonates in boiler feed water. When the water is 
turned into steam, some of these carbonates decompose into CO2. 
Thus, all steam is contaminated with CO2. The CO2 being far more 
volatile than water gets trapped and accumulates in the high points 
of steam heaters. With time, the CO2 condenses in the water to form 
carbonic acid. This causes corrosion and tube leaks. To avoid CO2 
accumulation, the exchanger high points can be vented.
I knew all this when I was a child. Not the carbonic acid part. I 
knew that Coke dissolved rust stains from sinks. I had seen Mrs. 
Fredirico, my friend Armand’s mother, clean a sink with Coke so I 
knew it would work. That’s my idea of applied technology—applying 
the experiences of ordinary life to process problems. I tried to explain 
this to Gloria, but we were both teenagers and she wasn’t interested. 
If she knew how much money I’ve made from my childhood experi-
ments, I bet she would be sorry now.
1.6  What I Know
Sometimes I work with process equipment as a field troubleshooter. 
Sometimes I specify equipment as a process design engineer. And 
often, I teach shift operators and plant engineers how equipment 
works. Whatever I’m doing, I have in mind my childhood experi-
ences in south Brooklyn. I focus on the analogy between the complex 
problem of today and the simple experiences of everyday life.
I often have my head in the clouds, but I always keep my feet on the 
ground. I learned this from my mother. She was a great storehouse of 
knowledge. And I’ve continued to learn as an adult too. Let me explain.
1.6.1  Toilet Training
The first skill that a new homeowner should acquire is toilet repair. I had 
my first lesson on this vital skill in 1969. We had just moved into our first 
house in south Chicago when I discovered our toilet wouldn’t flush. An 
experienced co-worker at the American Oil Refinery in Whiting, Indiana 
(now BP), suggested that I check the roof vent (see Fig. 1.2).

	
P r o c e s s  E q u i p m e n t  F u n d a m e n t a l s

Climbing onto the roof I found that a pigeon had built its nest on 
top of the 3-inch diameter vent pipe. I removed the nest and the toilet 
flushed just fine. The water swirled around merrily in the bowl for a 
few seconds. Next, the water gushed and rushed down the toilet’s 
drain with wonderful speed and vitality. The water seemed to be in 
such a hurry to leave the toilet bowl and escape through the sewer 
that it dragged a small amount of air with it. 
The verb “to drag” is a poor engineering term. The correct techni-
cal terminology describing this well-known phenomenon is that the 
rushing water sucked the air down the toilet’s drain. But the sucking 
of air out of my bathroom could only happen if the pressure in the 
toilet’s drain was less than the pressure in my bathroom. This idea 
bothered me for two reasons:
	
1.	 What caused a sub-atmospheric pressure (a partial vacuum) 
to develop at the bottom of my toilet bowl?
	
2.	 Where did the air sucked down into the drain go to?
Here’s the way it seems to me: When we flush the toilet, the velocity 
or the kinetic energy of the water swirling down the bowl increases.

The source of this kinetic energy is the height of water in the water 
closet. That is the potential energy of the water. We’re converting 
potential energy to kinetic energy in accord with Bernoulli’s equation.
If you live in an apartment house in Brooklyn, there is no water 
closet. The water supply for the toilet comes directly from the high 
pressure water supply line. Then we are converting the water’s pres-
sure to the velocity of water rushing into the toilet bowl. Either way, the 
spinning, draining water develops so much kinetic energy that the 
pressure of the water falls below atmospheric pressure. A slight vac-
uum is formed, which draws a small amount of air down the toilet’s 
drain.
When the air–water mixture enters the larger, vertical stand-pipe 
in Fig. 1.2, the velocity of the air–water mixture goes down. Some of 
this reduced kinetic energy is converted back into pressure. This I 
know because the pressure in the stand-pipe is atmospheric pressure. 
This has to be because the top of the stand-pipe is the 3-inch vent pipe 
sitting on the roof of my house. The air sucked down the toilet bowl 
escapes through this 3-inch vent. If a bird’s nest or snow clogs the 
vent, then the trapped air builds pressure in the stand-pipe. The back-
pressure from the stand-pipe restricts the flow of water from the 
bowl, and the toilet can no longer flush properly.
This is an example of Bernoulli’s equation in action. A steam vac-
uum ejector (jet) works in the same way. Centrifugal pumps and 
centrifugal compressors also work by converting velocity to pres-
sure. Steam turbines convert the steam’s pressure and enthalpy to 
velocity, and then the high velocity steam is converted into work, or 
electricity. The pressure drop we measure across a flow orifice plate 
is caused by the increase of the kinetic energy of the flowing fluid as 
it rushes (or accelerates) through the hole in the orifice plate.
Over the years I’ve purchased bigger and better homes. Now, Liz 
and I live in a house with seven bathrooms. Which is good, because 
at any given time, I almost always have at least one toilet mostly fully 
operational. Friends have asked why only two people need a house 
with seven bathrooms. Liz explains to them that, “If you ever tried to 
get my husband to fix anything, you would understand why Norm 
and I need a minimum of seven toilets in our home.”
1.7  Distillation: The First Application
Extensive research has revealed that the best method to combat stress 
is alcohol. In 1980 I tried to become an alcoholic. Regrettably, I would 
fall asleep after my second drink. Ever since, I’ve had a desire to learn 
more about bourbon and scotch. In particular, in the production of a 
single malt scotch, how is the liquor separated from the barley mash?
Since 2003, I’ve been providing periodic process engineering 
services to a refinery in Lithuania. One evening after work, I was 
walking past the local village liquor store. Displayed in the window, 

	
P r o c e s s  E q u i p m e n t  F u n d a m e n t a l s

surrounded by bottles of vodka, was a homemade still, as shown in 
Fig. 1.3. The two pots were just old soup cans. The big can containing 
the mash was about a gallon. The smaller can was 12 ounces. The 
appearance of the still suggested long use under adverse conditions. 
I’ll provide a process description of this archaic apparatus.
The liquor in the big can is heated by a fire. The contents of the big 
can are:
• Water
• Alcohol
• Bad-tasting impurities
The objective is to produce vodka in the bottle of not less than 100 
proof (that’s 50 volume percent alcohol). Suppose that the bottle con-
tains 80 proof (40 volume percent) alcohol. What can be done to bring 
the vodka up to the 50 percent spec?
There is only one thing that is under our control to change. This is 
the amount of firewood burned to supply heat to the big can. Should 
we add more heat to the big can or less heat?
If we add less heat to the big can, the vapor flow to the No. 1 condens-
ing coil will diminish. As the water is less volatile than the alcohol, most 
of the reduction in vapor flow will be at the expense of water vaporiza-
tion. Of course, there will be somewhat less vaporization of the more

C h a p t e r  O n e
volatile alcohol too. However, the primary effect will be to increase the 
percentage of alcohol in the vodka. This is good. The secondary effect is 
to reduce the vodka production. This is bad.
We would like to keep our product on spec (100 proof vodka) and 
also not lose production. To overcome this problem, we must first 
increase the heat input to the big can. To prevent the extra water 
vapor from diluting the vodka in the bottle, we must also increase the 
heat removed from the No. 1 coil. This is done by adding an addi-
tional length of coiled copper tubing to the No. 1 coil.
As a consequence of adding more heat to the big can, and also 
removing more heat from the No. 1 coil, more liquid will drain out of 
the 12-oz can, back to the big can. This liquid is called reflux. This 
reflux is revaporized in the big can and circulates back and forth 
between the big can and the 12-oz can. This recirculation helps to 
separate the lighter, more volatile alcohol from the heavier, less vola-
tile water.
There are several ways to describe what is happening. As a chem-
ical engineer, I would say that we are increasing the internal reflux 
ratio of the still. But what I would rather say is that we are making 
the still work harder. Harder in the sense that we are increasing both 
the reboiler heat duty and the condenser heat removal duty. By the 
reboiler duty, I mean to say the amount of firewood burning under the 
still. By the condenser heat removal duty, I mean the amount of heat 
radiating away to the air from the No. 1 condensing coil.
Why does making the still work harder decrease the water con-
tent of the vodka? Why does increasing the flow of reflux from the 
12-oz can back to the big can improve separation efficiency between 
alcohol and water?
Well, if I reduced the heat to the still a lot, and removed the No. 1 
coil (so that its heat removal duty was zero), then vapor would just 
blow through the 12-oz can. The water content of the vapor from the 
big can would be the same as the water content of the vodka in the 
bottle. The 12-oz can would then serve no purpose. However, as I par-
tially condense the vapor flow into the 12-oz can, the water content of 
the vapors flowing into the bottle goes down, because water is less 
volatile than alcohol. The extra heat added to the big can prevents the 
extra heat removed by the No. 1 coil from reducing vodka production.
1.7.1  Two-Stage Distillation Column
The 12-oz can has a second function. Its main purpose is to separate 
the vapor flowing into the bottle from the water-rich liquid flowing 
back to the big can. The secondary function of the 12-oz can is to trap 
out bad-tasting impurities boiled out of the big can before they con-
taminate the vodka in the bottle.
The still pictured in Fig. 1.3 is acting as a two-stage distillation 
column—that is, a fractionator that has two fractionation trays. 

	
P r o c e s s  E q u i p m e n t  F u n d a m e n t a l s 	
11
The bottom tray is the big can. The top tray is the 12-oz can. If I 
wanted to build a similar facility in a chemical plant, I would have:
• Big can plus fire equals a once-through thermosyphon reboiler
• 12-oz can plus No. 1 coil equals a partial condenser and reflux 
drum
• Bottle plus No. 2 coil equals a final condenser and collector 
drum
Adding distillation trays between the reboiler and the partial con-
denser would permit the reflux to more efficiently wash back the bad-
tasting impurities and water from the desirable and more volatile, 
up-flowing alcohol vapors. 
1.7.2  The Loop Seal
Figure 1.3 shows a loop on the 12-oz can drain line. Without this loop, 
vapors flowing from the big can would partially bypass the No. 1 coil. 
Even worse, without the loop seal, the vapors flowing up through the 
reflux line would stop the flow of reflux. The 12-oz can would then fill 
up until it overflowed bad-tasting, watery vodka into our bottle.
This is like unsealing a tray’s downcomer in a distillation tower. If 
the bottom edge of the downcomer from a tray is above the top edge of 
the outlet weir on the tray below, then vapor can blow up through the 
unsealed downcomer. This will prevent the internal reflux from drain-
ing down the column. Tower flooding and loss of product separation 
efficiency will result. This is called liquid flooding or excessive down-
comer backup due to loss of the downcomer liquid seal.
1.7.3  Size of the Big Can
I explained that as we add more heat to the big can (more reboiler duty) 
and more capacity to the No. 1 coil (more condenser duty) that fraction-
ation would get better. Better in the sense that the proof of the vodka 
would go up without reducing the production of vodka. Suppose, 
though, that the velocity of vapor leaving the big can becomes too great. 
We’ve all seen what happens when we boil soup too quickly in a small 
pot. The pot foams or floods over onto the stove. We should have used 
a bigger pot or we should have kept the heat low on the stove.
If the mash in the big can boils over or floods over, it will contami-
nate the 12-oz can with bad-tasting, water-rich liquid. If all this con-
taminated liquid cannot drain down through the loop seal fast enough, 
then the 12-oz can will also flood over into the bottle. The resulting 
weak, foul-tasting vodka will never be sold in Lithuania.
1.7.4  Jet Flood
The flooding over of the big can is rather similar to vapor or jet flood 
from a distillation tower tray. If the area of the tray is too small or if 

	
12	
C h a p t e r  O n e
the vertical separation (tray spacing) between the tray decks is inad-
equate for a particular vapor velocity, then the distillation tower will 
flood due to excessive entrainment of liquid from the tray below to 
the tray above. 
If the liquid is full of particulates, like starch when I boil pasta, 
then the flooding will occur at a lower vapor velocity. When my pasta 
pot floods over, I turn down the heat. If my vodka still is flooding, 
then more heat will increase, and not decrease, the water content of 
my vodka bottle. By checking how the heat added to my still is affect-
ing the proof of the vodka, I could determine the optimum amount of 
wood to burn under the still.
Same thing in a distillation column. If adding more reboiler duty 
and more reflux is making fractionation efficiency worse, then the 
column is suffering from flooding due to either downcomer backup 
or jet flood, or both. Note that the presence of particulates (dirt, rust, 
coke fines) reduces the capacity of distillation towers.
1.8  Origin of Reflux
As you read the subsequent chapters in this book, please recall the 
picture of the vodka still. Keep in mind that the origin of the reflux is 
the vapor generated from burning firewood beneath the big can. This 
concept is the key to understanding how distillation towers function. 
You cannot have more reflux without increasing your reboiler duty, 
unless you are willing to sacrifice the overhead product yield. And if 
extra reflux results in more heavy components in the overhead, the 
trays are flooding.
I have seen a working example of the first continuous distillation 
column in an apple orchard in southern England. It has a reboiler, feed 
preheater, reflux condenser, and four bubble cap distillation trays. The 
column produces apple brandy. We purchased a bottle of brandy from 
this orchard in 1996, but it remains unopened. Whenever I suggest that 
we open the bottle, Liz accuses me of trying to become an alcoholic.
1.9  Glossary
Many of the terms used in this text are defined in the following chap-
ter. Otherwise, the first time we have used a new technical term, we 
have tried to show the term in italics, which is then defined at the 
back of the text in the Glossary. A lot of my problems as a young engi-
neer were a result of my not being able to understand the vocabulary 
used in the process and refining industry. We have tried to address 
this problem in the Glossary and in Chap. 2.

CHAPTER 2
Basic Terms and 
Conditions
W
hen I reported to work at Amoco’s Whiting Refinery in 
1965, the plant operators and my fellow engineers assumed 
that I understood a wide range of terms that actually had 
little meaning to me. Worse, I was suddenly confronted with the need 
to employ basic technical concepts that I thought I had mastered in 
high school. But when I tried to apply these concepts to solve plant 
problems, I realized that I had never really understood them. I’ve 
assembled a list of the concepts and terms that I had to quickly learn 
early in my career. 
Work  I was told in school that work is force times distance. I still have no 
idea what this means. To me, work is carrying bricks up a hill. If I carry 
50 lb of bricks up a 100-ft hill, I have done 5000 ft-lb of work.
Power  This is how fast I work. If I carry 50 lb of bricks up a 100-ft-high 
hill in an hour, then my power output is 5000 ft-lb per hour. If I do the job 
in 30 min, my power output has doubled.
Amperage  Amps are a form of electric work. Motor amps are controlled 
by what the motor is driving, not the horsepower rating of the motor.
Kilowatts  Watts are a form of electric power.
BTU  This is the amount of heat needed to warm 1 lb of water by 1°F.
Latent heat  This is the number of BTUs needed to change 1 lb of liquid 
into 1 lb of vapor. For water, this is about 1000 BTU per pound; for diesel 
oil, about 100 BTU per pound.
Sensible heat  This is the heat associated with the temperature of the 
material. This does not include latent heat.
Specific heat  This is the number of BTUs needed to heat 1 lb of liquid 1°F; 
for water, 1.0 BTU; for diesel oil, 0.5 BTU.
Friction  A fluid moving through a pipe loses pressure. The lost pressure 
is converted to heat by friction inside the pipe. Friction converts work 
into heat. Converting heat back into work is much more difficult.
13

	
14	
C h a p t e r  T w o
Enthalpy  This is sensible heat plus latent heat.
Potential energy  This is pounds of material elevated above a base level. 
Multiply the elevation (feet) times the pounds. The answer has the units 
of foot-pounds, just like work.
Kinetic energy  This is the energy needed to accelerate a pound of mate-
rial from a low velocity to a higher velocity.
Acceleration energy  It takes more energy to make a fluid move faster 
than to keep it moving at a constant speed.
Momentum  An important term: Momentum is mass times velocity. Alice 
weighs 100 lb and has the same momentum as Alan, who weighs 200 lb. 
If Alice is running at 8 miles per hour, how fast is Alan running? (Answer: 
4 miles per hour.)
Energy  Add up momentum, kinetic energy, potential energy, enthalpy, 
work, friction, and amps. The sum of all these is the total energy of the 
system. The total energy of the system remains constant when one sort of 
energy is transformed to another type.
Reaction heat  I should have added that into the above list. If a chemical 
reaction such as burning wood liberates heat, it is called an exothermic 
reaction. Thermal cracking of hydrocarbons absorbs heat. That’s an endo-
thermic reaction.
Water hammer  If I hammer a nail into a brick wall, the nail gets very 
hot. This is an example of converting the momentum of the hammer 
into sensible heat of the nail. When water flowing through a pipe is 
suddenly stopped, the resulting bang is called “water hammer.” It’s 
the conversion of the momentum of the water into pressure.
Mole of gas  I have a box full of air. The air is at atmospheric pressure and 
60°F. The size of the box is such that it contains 379 ft3. The box size was 
selected arbitrarily a long time ago. The number of molecules of air inside 
the box is called a “mole” (mol) of air. The number of molecules is about 
1023. A really big number.
Molecular weight  If I weigh the air in this box, it will weigh 29 lb. There-
fore the molecular weight of air is 29 lb/mol of air. If the box contained 
hydrogen, it would weigh 2 lb. Therefore the molecular weight of 
hydrogen is 2. If I displace the hydrogen with propane from an LPG 
(Liquefied Petroleum Gas) cylinder, the box weight would be 44 lb. The 
molecular weight of propane is 44 lb.
Gas laws  As I double the absolute pressure of a gas, its volume is cut in 
half. As I double the absolute temperature of a gas, its volume doubles.
Absolute pressure  This is gauge pressure plus 14.7 psi (if I am at sea level) 
or number of bars pressure plus 1.0. (Note: psi is Pounds per Square Inch.)
Absolute temperature  This is °F temperature plus 460 R (Rankine) or °C 
temperature plus 273 K (Kelvin).

Compressibility  Heavier gases are easier to compress than lighter gases. 
The compressibility factor for hydrogen is 1.0. For propane or butane, it’s 
about 0.90.
Compression work  Work needed to boost the pressure of a mole of gas. It 
takes less work to compress 44 lb (1 mol) of propane than it takes to com-
press 2 lb (1 mol) of hydrogen, partly because of their compressibility factors.
Compression ratio  The compressor discharge pressure (in absolute pres-
sure) divided by the suction pressure (also in absolute pressure). If I’m 
compressing air, the suction pressure is atmospheric pressure, and the dis-
charge pressure is 29.4 psig, what is the compression ratio? (Answer: 3.)
Heat of compression  Gases get hot when they are compressed. The hotter 
they get, the less efficiently the compressor is working. Bigger compres-
sion ratios also increase the temperature of the gas as it is compressed.
Expansion cooling  You would suspect that when we depressure gas it 
would cool, if the gas gets hotter upon compression. Except for pure 
hydrogen, that is correct. Steam, air, and fuel gas all cool when we let the 
pressure down across a control valve.
Head  A tank with 23 ft of liquid has a head of 23 ft regardless of the 
liquid density. 
Head pressure  A tank with 23 ft of water has a head pressure of 
10 psi. A tank with 23 ft of gasoline has a head pressure of 7 psi, because 
gasoline is less dense than water. Its specific gravity is 0.70.
Specific gravity  Water has a density of 62 lb/ft3. This density has been 
arbitrarily defined as a specific gravity—1.00 s.g. Since gasoline has a den-
sity that is 70 percent of water, its specific gravity is 0.70 s.g.
Temperature correction of specific gravity  Hydrocarbon density drops by  
5 percent for each increase of 100°F. For water it’s 2 percent for each 100°F.
Viscosity  Expressed in centipoises it is a fluid property measuring how 
much a fluid in a pipe drags along the walls.
Centipoises or centistokes  Both terms have about the same value. A high 
viscosity fluid has 100 centipoises (cP) such as cold, heavy crude oil. A low 
viscosity fluid has 1 or 2 cP such as water or kerosene. Going from 2 to  
20 cP would about double the pressure drop in a pipeline. Liquids over 
100 cP or centistokes (cSt) are not easily pumped by a centrifugal pump. 
Increased temperature reduces viscosity.
Thermal conductivity  This is the ability of a material to let heat pass. Met-
als, water, and materials that are good conductors of electricity have a 
high thermal conductivity. Air, rubber, and materials that are bad con-
ductors of electricity have a low thermal conductivity. High viscosity 
hydrocarbons are bad conductors of heat.
Thermal expansion  Railroad tracks grow longer in the heat of the sun. The 
hot tubes in an exchanger grow more than the cold shell. Hence, we have a 

	
16	
C h a p t e r  T w o
floating head in the tube bundle to accommodate differential rates of thermal 
expansion between the tube bundle and the shell.
Auto-ignition  This is the temperature at which materials burn without a 
source of ignition. Gasoline auto-ignites at 450°F. Asphalt auto-ignites at 
320°F, methane at 1000°F. The heavier the hydrocarbon, the lower the 
auto-ignition temperature. Iron sulfide (pyrophoric iron) burns at room 
temperature when it is dry. 
Flash temperature  Hold a flame over a cup of diesel fuel; it will start to 
burn at its 160°F flash temperature. Gasoline’s flash temperature is below 
room temperature. Jet fuel’s flash is 110°F. The lighter the hydrocarbon, 
the lower the flash temperature.
Vapor pressure  This is a key concept. As we heat a liquid, the molecules in 
the liquid try to escape into the vapor phase. The hotter the liquid, the harder 
they try to escape. The pressure that the molecules of liquid create as they 
push out into the vapor space is the liquid vapor pressure. More volatile 
liquids such as LPG have a higher vapor pressure than less volatile diesel oil.
Boiling point  Heat a liquid and its vapor pressure increases. When the 
liquid’s vapor pressure equals the pressure in the vessel, the liquid starts 
to boil. The temperature at which this boiling starts is the liquid’s boiling 
temperature.
Bubble point  This is the same as boiling point. When a liquid is at its 
bubble point, it is also said to be a saturated liquid at the temperature and 
pressure. If we raise the pressure, the liquid’s bubble point temperature 
also goes up.
Dew point  A vapor at its dew point temperature is on the verge of start-
ing to condense to a liquid. Cool the vapor by 1°F, or raise its pressure by 
1 psi, and it will form drops of liquid. Air at 100 percent relative humidity 
is at its dew point temperature. Cool it by 1°F and it starts to rain.
Relative volatility  Divide the vapor pressure of a lighter material by the 
vapor pressure of a heavier material. The bigger the resulting number, the 
larger the relative volatility. It’s easier to separate two components in a 
distillation tower if they have a larger relative volatility.
Theoretical stage  This stage is created when vapor and liquid mix per-
fectly and then separate without entraining any drops of liquid into the 
vapor or retaining any foam in the liquid.
Tray efficiency  A tray in a distillation tower will work at some percentage 
of efficiency compared to a theoretical stage. This is mostly a function of 
how well the vapor and liquid are mixed on the tray deck, and how well 
they are then separated.
Gauge  This is the thickness of metal. The smaller the gauge, the thicker 
the metal. Twelve gauge is about 0.1 inch thick.
Mesh  This is the number of wires in a filter screen. The bigger the mesh, 
the finer the filter.

17
Flange  I worked at Amoco Oil for nine years before I found out what is 
meant by a flange. It’s the flat end of a pipe that is used to bolt up to a 
flange on another piece of piping. Bolts, with nuts at each end, are used 
to force the flanges together. A typical flange might have eight bolt holes.
Expansion loop  Piping thermally expands as it gets hot. Allowance must 
be made for the growth in pipe length, otherwise the pipe will break by 
cracking at its welds. We burned down a fractionator at the Good Hope 
Refinery because of such an omission.
Spool piece  Piping is made in sections with flanges at each end. This 
makes it easier to replace bad sections of pipe than if the piping sections 
were welded together, though welded pipe is cheaper.
Flange rating  Connections on vessels, spool pieces, and valves have a 
pressure rating called a flange rating. This rating can be confusing—for 
example, a 150 psig flange rating is actually good for about 230 psig design.
Gasket  This is the softer material that is pressed between flanges to keep 
them from leaking. Using the wrong gasket is a common cause of fires in 
process plants. Gaskets have different temperature and pressure ratings.
Pipe size  Process piping comes in particular nominal sizes:
0.75 inch	
   —
   1 inch	
  25 mm
   2 inch	
  50 mm
  2.5 inch	
   —
   3 inch	
  80 mm
   4 inch	
100 mm
   6 inch	
150 mm
   8 inch	
200 mm
   10 inch	
250 mm
The nominal size does not refer either to the outside or the inside 
diameter of the pipe. Pipe thickness affects the internal diameter (ID).
Tube sizes  Tubing sizes are entirely different from pipe sizes. Tubing is 
often used in heat exchangers and fired equipment like furnaces.
Screwed fittings  These are used to assemble screwed connections and 
field instruments on pipes. There are:
• Pipe thread fittings
• Instrument or tubing fittings
• Metric fittings
None of these will screw together.
Relief valves  These valves open to relieve excess pressure to protect a 
vessel from failure. Also called safeties or pop valves.

	
18	
C h a p t e r  T w o
Flare system  This is a piping network that runs through the plant to col-
lect vents of gas so that they can be combusted at a safe location in the 
flare stack.
Utilities  Most plants have some of the following utility systems con-
nected to process units:
•  Natural gas
•  Nitrogen
•  Plant air
•  Instrument air
•  Steam of various pressures
•  Cooling water
•  Service water
•  Boiler feed water
•  Fire water
•  Fuel gas
•  City water
Your company safety policy does not permit you to cross-connect 
these systems. Connecting natural gas to plant air killed 17 workers at a 
Louisiana refinery. 
MAWP (maximum allowable working pressure)  This is the legal maximum pres-
sure that a process vessel is allowed to experience. Above this pressure, a 
relief valve should open to protect the vessel from catastrophic failure.
FLA (full-limit amps)  This is the maximum amperage a motor should 
draw before it automatically trips off—rather like the 20-A circuit breaker 
at home.
Stress relief  Coded vessels typically have a metal stamp attached that 
states, “Do not weld, stress relieved.” That means the vessel has been 
post-weld heat treated to remove stresses in the vessel wall created by 
welding during fabrication.
Alarms  Process parameters (levels, temperatures, pressures, flows) are 
automatically controlled within a permissible range. If the parameter 
moves outside this range, it sometimes activates both an audible and a 
visual alarm. If the panel board operator fails to take corrective action, a 
trip may also then be activated.
Trip  This is a safety device that automatically shuts down a piece of 
equipment. It’s a fail-safe mechanism often activated by unlatching a 
spring-operated valve, which then closes.
Gate valve  This valve closes by sliding a plate or gate down between two 
grooves. Used to isolate different portions of the process equipment not 
used to control flow. The valve closes clockwise and takes about a dozen 

	
B a s i c  Te r m s  a n d  C o n d i t i o n s 	
19
turns to close. Ninety percent of the valves used in process plants are gate 
valves.
Plug valve  This valves goes from 100 percent open to shut by turning 
a valve 90°. The natural gas supply to your house is shut off with a plug 
valve.
Control valve  This valve is used to alter flows remotely. Normally it is 
moved by air pressure. A gate valve is sometimes used to control flows 
locally, but this wears out the valve and is best avoided.
Strobe light  A modern tachometer used to measure rpm of rotating 
equipment. Old-style tachometers measured speed by measuring vibra-
tion frequency. They are called reed tachometers. 
Dynamic machine  Centrifugal pumps and centrifugal compressors are 
dynamic machines. They convert velocity imparted by the impeller to the 
fluid into fluid pressure.
Positive displacement machine  A reciprocating compressor or gear type 
pump is an example of a positive displacement machine. It increases pres-
sure by squeezing or pushing the fluid into a region of greater pressure.
Turbine  A turbine uses steam pressure or burning gas to drive pumps 
and compressors at variable speeds. Motor drives are usually fixed-speed 
machines. Variable speed is an energy-efficient way to control flows by 
eliminating the downstream control valve.
Surge  This is a terrifying sound that centrifugal compressors make 
when they malfunction either due to low flow or excessive discharge 
pressure, or low molecular weight gas.
Spillback  A spillback allows fluid to recycle from the discharge back to 
the suction of a machine. It’s one way to stop a centrifugal compressor 
from surging.
Cavitation  When the pressure of liquid flowing into a centrifugal pump 
gets too low, liquid boils inside the pump case and generates bubbles. 
The discharge pressure and flow become erratically low.
Mechanical seal  This is the part of a centrifugal pump that keeps the 
liquid from squirting out along the shaft. It is often subject to leakage due 
to pump vibration and cavitation.
AC motor  Most of our pumps are driven by alternating current (AC), 
three-phase motors. Such motors that drive pumps are usually fixed-speed 
drivers. Direct current (DC) motors are rarely used in process plants.
NPSH (net positive suction head)  The net positive suction head required 
to keep a centrifugal pump from cavitating. Cooling a liquid in a pump’s 
suction line increases the pump’s available NPSH, as does increasing the 
liquid level in the suction drum.
Entrainment  Droplets of liquid are carried out of a vessel with the efflu-
ent vapors. High vapor velocities promote entrainment.

	
20	
C h a p t e r  T w o
Flooding  Massive entrainment of liquid caused by high-level or high veloc-
ity of the up-flowing vapor. A vapor-liquid separator (KO or Knock Out 
drum) that floods can wreck a downstream compressor in a few seconds.
Tapped-out  This is a mechanism of flooding due to a high liquid level 
caused by flawed calibration of the level indicator. The liquid level has 
risen above the upper level indication connection point.
Level-trol  This is the most common device used to measure levels in ves-
sels. It works by measuring pressure differences between two level taps 
at different elevations.
Thermocouple  A thermocouple consists of two wires of dissimilar met-
als. When joined and heated at their junction, a small electric current is 
generated. The hotter, the greater the current. That’s how we measure 
temperature by measuring the current produced by a thermocouple. The 
thermocouple is housed inside a thermowell.
Orifice plate  In an orifice plate, fluid flows through a metal plate with a 
hole. As it accelerates through this hole, the fluid pressure is reduced. The 
bigger the flow, the greater the DP. An orifice plate has a handle that sticks 
out of the piping showing the size of the orifice.
Pressure transducer  A diaphragm is deformed inside a tube. This defor-
mation generates an electric signal in proportion to the pressure inside 
the tube. The electric signal is used to monitor the pressure.
Draft  A draft is the pressure difference inside a heater firebox and the 
surrounding air at the same elevation. The draft causes combustion air to 
flow through the burners and up the stack.
Radiant heat  Inside a firebox, radiant heat is the heat that is transferred 
from the flames to the bricks and tubes by radiation from the flame. Most 
heat in a firebox is liberated as radiant heat. Sunlight is an example of 
radiant heat transfer.
Convective heat  At the top of a firebox there is another section of the heater 
packed with tubes. Usually, these tubes have fins or studs. This is the sec-
tion of the heater where convective heat transfer occurs. About 30 percent 
of heat recovered in a process heater is due to convective heat transfer. A 
sauna is an example of convective heat transfer.
Thermosyphon circulation (or natural circulation)  Partially vaporizing a liq-
uid causes it to flow to a higher elevation. The driving force is the density 
difference between the denser liquid feed and the less dense, partly 
vaporized effluent.
Forced circulation  This is when a liquid is circulated through a heater or 
exchanger by means of a pump. A more complex and costly option as 
compared to thermosyphon circulation.
Gravity feed  A kettle-type reboiler is an example of gravity feed. Flow 
is obtained by the liquid elevation above the exchanger. There is no 

	
B a s i c  Te r m s  a n d  C o n d i t i o n s 	
21
recirculation of liquid. Liquid simply flows from a higher elevation down 
to the exchanger where it is partially vaporized.
Reynolds number  A measure of how turbulent a flow is. It’s the linear 
velocity, times density, times internal pipe diameter, divided by viscosity.
Packed pump  Centrifugal pumps that handle water or nonhazardous 
liquids do not use a mechanical seal. They use a cheaper and simpler 
packed seal.
Bernoulli’s equation  Conservation of energy. If we want higher fluid 
velocity, that extra energy must come from heat, pressure, or external 
work.
Bleeder  A small drain (¾ inch or ½ inch) on a pump case, bottom of a 
vessel, or low point of a piping system. Must be kept capped or plugged.
MAWP  Maximum allowable working pressure legally permitted for a 
vessel. The vessel will have an ASME code stamp. Heat exchangers are 
also rated with MAWP.
Thermowell  The thermowell is a metal sleeve with a closed end inserted 
into a process vessel or process piping. A thermocouple is inserted inside 
the thermowell. Never unscrew the thermowell from a vessel that’s in 
service.
Kettle reboiler  Also called a gravity feed reboiler. It has only a vapor outlet 
nozzle venting back to the tower.
Bridle  Same as level-trol or stand-pipe. Used to measure liquid levels in 
a process vessel.
Vortex breaker  Located in draw-off nozzle sumps, or on the liquid outlet 
of the bottom of a vessel. Not required for low nozzle outlet velocities.
Nozzle  Connections on the side of vessels and heat exchangers. Nozzles 
come in standard sizes corresponding to standard pipe diameters.
Vacuum jet nozzle  Small precision-engineered steel nozzle located within 
a vacuum jet.
Entropy  The measure of the potential ability of a fluid to do work. As the 
entropy of a fluid increases, its ability to do work decreases.
Grid tray  Similar to a sieve tray. A perforated distillation tray deck, but 
with no movable valve caps. Represents modern distillation tray design.
Panel operator  The operator assigned to control the unit. This individual 
will work 8- to 12-hour shifts and is normally regarded as the most 
important person on a process unit at any given time. Usually not an 
engineer, but an experienced plant operator.
Process engineer  One who uses the principles of heat balance, hydraulics, 
vapor-liquid equilibrium, and chemistry to solve plant operating problems 
and optimize operating variables. Your authors are process engineers.

I hope that understanding these concepts and terms will help you in 
understanding the remainder of our book. Some concepts reappear in 
different forms. For example, check my descriptions of draft and 
thermosyphon circulation. They are really the same concept—heat 
that causes a density difference causes a flow. The application is dif-
ferent, but the concept is the same.

CHAPTER 3
How Trays Work: 
Flooding
History of Distillation
The ancient Egyptians produced beer from barley that had a few 
percent of alcohol. Next, wine was produced by fermenting grape 
juice, which had a greater sugar content than barley. This brought 
the content of alcohol up to about 14 percent. Next, fortified wines 
(like sherry or port) were made by adding extra sugar and yeast to 
the fermenting grape juice. This increased the alcohol up to about  
17 percent. Much above this point, alcohol kills off the yeast.
Next, distillation was used. I visited a primitive distillation plant 
in Peru. It was a single-stage evaporation process. The fermented grape 
juice is partially vaporized and the alcohol–water vapors are totally 
condensed. The resulting condensate is 40 to 44 percent alcohol. The 
higher alcohol content is obtained by vaporizing less of the still’s 
content.
To go much beyond the 44 percent alcohol, one needs to intro-
duce modern process engineering technology:
• Partial condensation
• Reflux
• Reboiler
I’ve shown a sketch of such a facility in Fig. 1.3. The idea is to 
generate reflux to improve the separation between water and etha-
nol. To generate reflux, a partial (rather than a total) condenser is 
required. Also, a way of adding more heat to the still, to match up 
with the capacity of the partial condenser, is needed. I’ve now intro-
duced a complex control loop into my plant. Alcohol levels of 60-plus 
percent can be obtained with this two-stage evaporator.
Finally, we have the Patent Still, introduced by the Scots in the 
1830s. Now, distillation trays equipped with bubble caps and feed 
preheat are used. I visited an apple orchard in England, which used 
23

	
24	
C h a p t e r  T h r e e
the original design of the Patent Still to produce apple brandy. A sketch 
of this apparatus, whose design has not been altered in 180 years, is 
shown in Fig. 3.1. The sketch has been copied from the original patent 
application filed in London in the 1830s. 
With the multitrayed distillation column, ethanol concentrations 
(as limited by the alcohol–water azeotrope) of 90-plus percent can be 
obtained, if enough reflux and enough trays are used.
3.1  Tray Types
Distillation towers are the heart of a process plant, and the working 
component of a distillation column is the tray. A tray consists of the 
following components, as shown in Fig. 3.2:
• Overflow, or outlet weir
• Downcomer
• Tray deck
There are two types of tray decks: perforated trays and bubble-
cap trays. In this chapter, we describe only perforated trays, examples 
of which are
• Valves or flutter caps
• V grid, or extruded-valve caps
• Sieve decks
• Jet trays
Figure 3.1  The very first distillation tower was the Patent Still. This drawing was 
filed with the original patent application submitted in 1835. Column on the right is a 
bubble-cap trayed tower. Column on the left is a feed preheater vs. an overhead 
vapor condenser.

	
H o w  Tr a y s  W o r k :  F l o o d i n g 	
25
Possibly 90 percent of the trays seen in the plant are of these types. 
Perforated tray decks all have one feature in common; they depend 
on the flow of vapor through the tray deck perforations, to prevent 
liquid from leaking through the tray deck. As we will see later, if 
liquid bypasses the outlet weir and leaks through the tray deck onto 
the tray below, tray separation efficiency will suffer.
3.2  Tray Efficiency
Distillation trays in a fractionator operate between 10 and 90 percent 
efficiency. It is the process person’s job to make trays operate as close 
to 90-percent efficiency as possible. Calculating tray efficiency is 
sometimes simple. Compare the vapor temperature leaving a tray to 
the liquid temperature leaving the trays. For example, the efficiency 
of the tray shown in Fig. 3.3 is 100 percent. The efficiency of the tray 
in Fig. 3.4 is 0 percent.
How about the 10 trays shown in Fig. 3.5? Calculate their average 
efficiency (the answer is 10 percent). As the vapor temperature rising 
from the top tray equals the liquid temperature draining from the 
bottom tray, the 10 trays are behaving as a single perfect tray with 
100-percent efficiency. But as there are 10 trays, each tray, on average, 
acts like one-tenth of a perfect tray.

Poor tray efficiency is caused by one of two factors:
• Flooding
• Dumping
In this chapter, we discuss problems that contribute to tray deck 
flooding.

C h a p t e r  T h r e e
3.3  Downcomer Backup
Liquid flows across a tray deck toward the outlet weir. The liquid over-
flows the weir, and drains through the downcomer to the tray below.
Vapor bubbles up through the sieve holes, or valve caps, on the tray 
deck, where the vapor comes into intimate contact with the liquid. 
More precisely, the fluid on the tray is a froth or foam—that is, a mix-
ture of vapor and liquid. In this sense, the function of a tray is to mix the 
vapor and liquid together to form a foam. This foam should separate 
back into a vapor and a liquid in the downcomer. If the foam cannot 
drain quickly from a downcomer onto the tray below, then the foamy 
liquid or froth will back up onto the tray above. This is called flooding.
3.4  Downcomer Clearance
Referring to Fig. 3.6, note that the downcomer B is flooding. The cause 
is loss of the downcomer seal. The height of the outlet weir is below the 
bottom edge of the downcomer from the tray above. This permits 
vapor to flow up downcomer B. The up-flowing vapor displaces the 
downflowing liquid. That is, the vapor pushes the liquid up onto the 
tray above—which is a cause of flooding. On the other hand, Fig. 3.7 
shows what happens if the bottom edge of the downcomer is too close 
to the tray below. The high pressure drop needed for the liquid to 
escape from downcomer B onto tray deck 1 causes the liquid level in 
downcomer B to back up onto tray deck 2. Tray 2 then floods. Once tray 
2 floods, downcomer C (shown in Fig. 3.7) will also back up and flood. 
This process will continue until all the tray decks and downcomers 
above downcomer B are flooded.
On the other hand, all trays in a tower below downcomer B will 
lose liquid levels and dry out when flooding starts in downcomer B. 
Thus, the following rules apply:
• When flooding starts on a tray, all the trays above that point 
will also flood, but trays below that point will go dry.
• An early indication of flooding in a distillation column is loss 
of liquid level in the bottom of the column.
• If the downcomer clearance—which means the distance 
between the bottom edge of the downcomer and the tray 
below—is too great, the downcomer becomes unsealed. Vapor 
flows up the downcomer, and the trays above flood.
• If the downcomer clearance is too small, then liquid backs up 
in the downcomer, and the trays above flood. To calculate the 
height of liquid in the downcomer, due to liquid flowing 
through the downcomer clearance:
DH = 0.6 × V 2

where	 DH = inches of clear liquid backup in the downcomer, due to 
head loss under the downcomer
	
V = horizontal component of liquid velocity, in ft/s, as the  
liquid escapes from the downcomer
To guarantee a proper downcomer seal, the bottom edge of a 
downcomer should be about 0.5 inch below the top edge of the outlet 
weir. This dimension should be carefully checked by process person-
nel when a tower is opened for inspection. It is quite easy for sloppy 
tray installation to distort this critical factor.
3.4.1  Height of Liquid on Tray Deck
As the liquid level on a tray increases, the height of liquid in the 
downcomer feeding this tray will increase by the same amount. 
Again, excessive downcomer liquid or froth levels result in flooding 
and loss of tray efficiency.
The liquid level on a tray is a function of two factors:
• Weir height
• Crest height
The weir height on many trays is adjustable. We usually adjust 
the weir height to between 2 and 3 inches. This produces a reasonable 
depth of liquid on the tray to promote good vapor-liquid contact.
The crest height is similar to the height of water overflowing a 
dam. It is calculated from
Crest height = 0.4 (GPM ÷ inch (outlet) weir length)0.67
where crest height = inches of clear liquid overflowing the weir
	
GPM = gallons (U.S.) per minute of liquid leaving the 
tray
The sum of the crest height plus the weir height equals the depth 
of liquid on the tray deck. One might now ask, “Is not the liquid 
level on the inlet side of the tray higher than the liquid level near the 
outlet weir?” While the answer is “Yes, water does flow downhill,” 
we design the tray to make this factor small enough to neglect.
3.5  Vapor-Flow Pressure Drop
We have yet to discuss the most important factor in determining the 
height of liquid in the downcomer. This is the pressure drop of the 
vapor flowing through the tray deck. Typically, 50 percent of the level 
in the downcomer is due to the flow of vapor through the trays.
When vapor flows through a tray deck, the vapor velocity increases 
as the vapor flows through the small openings provided by the valve 
caps, or sieve holes. The energy to increase the vapor velocity comes 

	
H o w  Tr a y s  W o r k :  F l o o d i n g 	
31
from the pressure of the flowing vapor. A common example of this is 
the pressure drop we measure across an orifice plate. If we have a pipe-
line velocity of 2 ft/s and an orifice plate hole velocity of 40 ft/s, then 
the energy needed to accelerate the vapor as it flows through the orifice 
plate comes from the pressure drop of the vapor itself.
Let us assume that vapor flowing through a tray deck undergoes 
a pressure drop of 1 psi (lb/in2). Figure 3.8 shows that the pressure 
below tray deck 2 is 10 psig and the pressure above tray deck 2 is  
9 psig. How can the liquid in downcomer B flow from an area of low 
pressure (9 psig) to an area of high pressure (10 psig)? The answer is 
gravity, or liquid head pressure.
The height of water needed to exert a liquid head pressure of 1 psi 
is equal to 28 inches. of water. If we were working with gasoline, which 
has a specific gravity of 0.70, then the height of gasoline needed to exert 
a liquid head pressure of 1 psi would be 28 inches/0.70 = 40 inches of 
clear liquid.
3.5.1  Total Height of Liquid in the Downcomer
To summarize, the total height of clear liquid in the downcomer is the 
sum of four factors:
• Liquid escape velocity from the downcomer onto the tray 
below.
• Weir height.
• Crest height of liquid overflowing the outlet weir.
• The pressure drop of the vapor flowing through the tray 
above the downcomer. (Calculating this pressure drop is dis-
cussed in Chap. 4.)

C h a p t e r  T h r e e
Unfortunately, we do not have clear liquid, either in the down-
comer, on the tray itself, or overflowing the weir. We actually have a 
froth or foam called aerated liquid. While the effect of this aeration on 
the specific gravity of the liquid is largely unknown and is a function of 
many complex factors (surface tension, dirt, tray design, etc.), an aera-
tion factor of 50 percent is often used for many hydrocarbon services.
This means that if we calculated a clear liquid level of 12 inches in 
our downcomer, then we would actually have a foam level in the 
downcomer of 12 inches/0.50 = 24 inches of foam.
If the height of the downcomer plus the height of the weir were 
24 inches, then a downcomer foam height of 24 inches would corre-
spond to downcomer flooding. This is sometimes called liquid flood.
This discussion assumes that the cross-sectional area of the down-
comer is adequate for reasonable vapor-liquid separation. If the 
downcomer loading (GPM/ft2 of downcomer top area) is less than 
150, this assumption is okay, at least for most clean services. For dirty, 
foamy services a downcomer loading of 100 GPM/ft2 would be safer.
3.6  Jet Flood
Figure 3.9 is a realistic picture of what we would see if our towers 
were made of glass. In addition to the downcomers and tray decks 
containing froth or foam, there is a quantity of spray, or entrained 
liquid, lifted above the froth level on the tray deck. The force that

generates this entrainment is the flow of vapor through the tower. 
The spray height of this entrained liquid is a function of two factors:
• The foam height on the tray
• The vapor velocity through the tray
High vapor velocities, combined with high foam levels, will 
cause the spray height to hit the underside of the tray above. This 
causes mixing of the liquid from a lower tray with the liquid on the 
upper tray. This backmixing of liquid reduces the separation, or tray 
efficiency, of a distillation tower.
When the vapor flow through a tray increases, the height of froth 
in the downcomer draining the tray will also increase. This does not 
affect the foam height on the tray deck until the downcomer fills with 
foam. Then a further increase in vapor flow causes a noticeable 
increase in the foam height of the tray deck, which then increases the 
spray height.
When the spray height from the tray below hits the tray above, 
this is called the incipient flood point, or the initiation of jet flooding. 
Note, though, that jet flood may be caused by excessive downcomer 
backup. It is simple to see in a glass column separating colored water 
from clear methanol how tray separation efficiency is reduced as 
soon as the spray height equals the tray spacing. And while this 
observation of the onset of incipient flood is straightforward in a 
transparent tower, how do we observe the incipient flooding point in 
a commercial distillation tower?
The reason I can write with confidence on this subject is that I 
worked with a 4-inch demonstration transparent column at the Chev-
ron Refinery in Port Arthur, Texas, in 1989. I used the little distillation 
tower to explain to plant technicians how distillation towers worked. 
The tower’s feed was windshield wiper fluid with blue dye. The alco-
hol went overhead and the blue water was the bottoms product.
3.7  Incipient Flood
3.7.1  A Fundamental Concept
Figure 3.10 illustrates the operation of a simple propane-butane split-
ter. The tower controls are such that both the pressure and bottoms 
temperature are held constant. This means that the percent of pro-
pane in the butane bottoms product is held constant. If the operator 
increases the top reflux flow, here is what will happen:
	
1.	 The tower-top temperature drops.
	
2.	 The amount of butane in the overhead propane product drops.
	
3.	 The tower-bottom temperature starts to fall.

	
34	
C h a p t e r  T h r e e
	
4.	 The reboiler duty increases, to restore the tower-bottom tem-
perature to its set point.
	
5.	 The weight flow of vapor and the vapor velocity through the 
tray increase.
	
6.	 The spray height, or entrainment, between the trays increases.
	
7.	 When the spray height from the lower trays impacts the 
upper trays, the heavier, butane-rich liquid contaminates the 
lighter liquid on the upper trays with heavier butane.

8.	 Further increases in the reflux rate then act to increase, rather 
than decrease, the butane content of the overhead propane 
product.
Figure 3.11 illustrates this point. Point A is called the incipient 
flood point, that point in the tower’s operation at which either an 
increase or a decrease in the reflux rate results in a loss of separation 
efficiency. You might call this the optimum reflux rate; that would be 
an alternate description of the incipient flood point.
3.7.2  Bypassing Steam Trap Stops Flooding
I wake up early to answer email questions before breakfast. Here’s 
today’s question from South Africa:
• Hi Norman. We have a distillation tower that floods. Delta P 
on trays below feed point is stable; delta P above feed (trays 
16–22), increase from 9 to 19 KPA. Condenser and reflux 
drum is internal in tower, and we cannot measure the reflux 
rate. Yesterday, bypassed steam trap on reboiler outlet, and 
flooding stopped. Conclude that flooding tower due to defec-
tive steam trap. What’s your opinion? Note tower fraction-
ation also improved after trap bypassed.
Regards,
Jon Sacha
• Dear Jon: You’re quite wrong. When you bypassed the steam 
trap, you blew the condensate seal on the reboiler outlet. This 
permitted uncondensed steam to blow through the reboiler,

thus reducing the reboiler duty. The reduction in the reboiler 
duty reduced the vapor flow up the tower and hence the inter-
nal reflux rate. This unloaded the trays and stopped the flood-
ing. Your observation that the tower fractionation improved as a 
consequence of bypassing the steam trap was a positive indica-
tion that you had degraded tray efficiency due to entrainment. 
That is, you were operating above the tower’s incipient flood 
point. Certainly, there is nothing amiss with your reboiler steam 
trap. You should try to water wash the trays above the feed 
point onstream, as the trays in this service are typically subject to 
NH4Cl salt sublimation. Hope this helps.

Norman P. Lieberman
3.8  Tower Pressure Drop and Flooding
It is a characteristic of process equipment that the best operation is 
reached at neither a very high nor a very low loading. The intermedi-
ate equipment load that results in the most efficient operation is 
called the best efficiency point. For distillation trays, the incipient flood 
point corresponds to the best efficiency point. We have correlated this 
best efficiency point for valve and sieve trays as compared to the mea-
sured pressure drops in many distillation towers. We have derived the 
following formula:
	
(
)(28)
(NT)(TS)(s.g.)
P
K
∆
=
	
where	 DP = pressure drop across a tray section, psi
	
NT = the number of trays
	
TS = tray spacing, inches
	
s.g. = specific gravity of clear liquid, at flowing temperatures
On the basis of hundreds of field measurements, we have observed
K = 0.18 to 0.25: Tray operation is close to its best efficiency point.
K = 0.35 to 0.40: Tray is suffering from entrainment—increase in 
reflux rate noticeably reduces tray efficiency.
K = ≥0.5: Tray is in fully developed flood—opening a vent on the 
overhead vapor line will blow out liquid with the vapor.
K = 0.10 to 0.12: Tray deck is suffering from low tray efficiency, due 
to tray deck leaking.
K = 0.00: The liquid level on the tray is zero, and quite likely the 
trays are lying on the bottom of the column.
K = 1.00: Tower is completely full of liquid.

	
H o w  Tr a y s  W o r k :  F l o o d i n g 	
37
3.8.1  Carbon Steel Trays
One of the most frequent causes of flooding is the use of carbon steel 
trays. Especially when the valve caps are also carbon steel, the valves 
have a tendency to stick in a partially closed position. This raises the 
pressure drop of the vapor flowing through the valves, which, in 
turn, pushes up the liquid level in the downcomer draining the tray. 
The liquid can then back up onto the tray deck and promote jet flood 
due to entrainment.
Of course, any factor (dirt, polymers, gums, salts) that causes a 
reduction in the open area of the tray deck will also promote jet flood-
ing. Indeed, most trays flood below their calculated flood point, 
because of these sorts of problems. Trays, like people, rarely perform 
quite up to expectations.
The use of movable valve caps in any service where deposits can 
accumulate on the tray decks will cause the caps to stick to the tray 
deck. It’s best to avoid this potential problem. Use of grid trays with 
fixed cap assemblies is preferred for most services.
3.9  Optimizing Feed Tray Location
From the design perspective, the optimum feed tray, for a feed with 
only two components, is that tray where the ratio of the two compo-
nents matches the ratio in the feed. If the feed is at its bubble point 
temperature, then the feed temperature and the tray temperature will 
be the same, at the same pressure.
But that’s only for a binary feed composition. In multicomponent 
distillation, the ratio of the key components in the feed will typically 
not coincide with the ratio of the key components in the liquid on the 
tray, even though the tray temperature is the same as the feed at its 
bubble point temperature.
So the question is, which of the following two criteria should be 
used to determine the feed tray location:
• Where the ratio of the key components in the liquid on a tray 
matches the ratio of the key components in the feed?
• Or where the feed temperature matches the temperature of 
the tray?
My practice is to identify both possible locations and then locate 
the feed nozzle halfway between the two options. I would provide 
two alternate feed nozzles at each of the other above locations, except 
the operators would likely never use them.
Incidentally, when I refer to “Key Components,” I mean, for 
example:
• Debutanizer—Normal Butane and iso-Pentane
• Depropanizer—Propane and iso-Butane

	
38	
C h a p t e r  T h r e e
• De-Ethanizer—Ethane and Propylene
• Gasoline Splitter—iso-Hexane and cyclo-Hexane
All of the above services have feeds with dozens of other non-key 
components.
3.10  Catacarb CO2 Absorber Flooding
I’ve never told this story to anyone. Not even to Liz or my mom. It 
occurred in Lithuania in 2006. I had been hired to expand the capac-
ity of the hydrogen plant that was limiting refinery capacity. The 
bottleneck was the absorber that removed CO2 with catacarb solu-
tion from the hydrogen product. This absorber was subject to flood-
ing as the catacarb circulation rate increased in proportion to H2 
production. That is, the solution was carried overhead with the 
hydrogen product.
I studied the design of the tower, but could not see an explanation 
for the flooding. Nevertheless, I decided to modify all the 40 trays in 
the absorber. The materials were ordered, and the labor force organ-
ized. However, the morning the absorber was opened, I received a 
call from my assistant, Joe.
“Hey, Norm, there’s kind of a plate in front of the solution inlet 
nozzle (see Fig. 3.12). It don’t show on the drawings. What you want 
to do with that plate?”
“Joe,” I answered, “I’ll be there in 10 minutes.”
I looked at the plate. Dimension “x” was only about ¾ inch. Evi-
dently, the plate was intended as an inlet solution distributor. I calcu-
lated that the delta P, as the solution flowed underneath the plate, 
was about 15 inches:
• Delta H (inches) = 0.6 (V)2
• Where V was the solution velocity through the ¾-inch gap in 
feet per second.
• The plate was 12 inches high. As the solution rate increased, 
the liquid would back up over the top edge of the plate 
and be blown out of the top of the absorber. So, I told Joe to 
have the bottom 2 inches of the plate cut off to increase “x” 
to 2¾ inches.
“And, Joe,” I continued, “Also, close up the tower afterward.”
“Norm, but what about all the tower tray changes?” Joe pro-
tested.
“Don’t argue. I know what I’m doing.”
When the tower started up a week later, the Hydrogen Plant bot-
tleneck was gone. The plant manager never found out what I did, 

	
H o w  Tr a y s  W o r k :  F l o o d i n g 	
39
or that I had wasted $20,000 for unused tray materials. Perhaps, since 
I had achieved the objective, he wouldn’t have cared. Anyway, the 
alternate proposal to expand H2 plant capacity, submitted by a major 
engineering contractor, would have cost $3,000,000.
“All’s well that ends well.”

CHAPTER 4
How Trays Work: 
Dumping
Weeping through Tray Decks
A 
distillation tray works efficiently when the vapor and liquid 
come into intimate contact on the tray deck. To this end, the  
  liquid should flow evenly across the tray deck. The vapor 
should bubble up evenly through the perforations on the tray deck. 
The purpose of the outlet weir is to accomplish both these objectives, 
as follows:
	
1.	 Uneven liquid flow across the tray deck is particularly detri-
mental to good vapor-liquid mixing. For example, if half of 
the tray deck has stagnant liquid, then the vapor bubbling 
through the stagnant liquid cannot alter its composition. 
	
	     Let me explain. A tray deck is a flat plate with holes. Liquid 
runs across the plate. Vapor bubbles up through the holes. If 
liquid only runs across part of this plate, vapor will still bubble 
up through the holes in the whole plate.
	
	     The vapor bubbling up through that portion of the tray 
deck where the liquid flow is active will mix with the flowing 
liquid. The flowing liquid will wash out the heavier components 
from the rising vapors.
	
	     On the other hand, the vapor bubbling up through that 
portion of the tray deck where the liquid flow is zero will also 
mix with the stagnant liquid. But it’s like trying to wash dirty 
clothes in dirty water. The stagnant liquid cannot wash out 
the heavier components from the vapors, because it is already 
saturated with these heavier components.
	
	     Uneven liquid flow is promoted by the outlet weir being 
out of level. Liquid will tend to flow across that portion of the 
tray with a lower than average weir height. The portion of the 
tray upstream of the high part of the outlet weir will contain 
stagnant liquid. However, if the crest height (i.e., the height of 
41

	
42	
C h a p t e r  F o u r
liquid over the weir) is large, compared to the out-of-levelness 
of the tray, then an even liquid flow across the tray will result. 
To achieve a reasonable crest height above the outlet weir, a 
weir loading of at least 2 GPM per inch of weir length is 
needed. When liquid flows are small, the tray designer 
employs a picket weir, as shown in Fig. 4.1.
	
2.	 Uneven vapor flow bubbling up through the tray deck will 
promote vapor-liquid channeling. This sort of channeling 
accounts for many trays that fail to fractionate up to expecta-
tions. To understand the cause of this channeling, we will 
have to quantify total tray pressure drop.
4.1  Tray Pressure Drop
4.1.1  Total Tray DP
Figure 4.2 shows a simple sieve tray with a single hole. Why is it that 
the liquid flows over the 3-inch outlet weir, rather than simply drain-
ing down through the sieve hole? It is the force of the vapor (or better, 
the velocity of the vapor) passing through the sieve hole that prevents 
the liquid from draining down the sieve hole. This is true whether we 
are dealing with a valve cap, extruded perforation, or a sieve hole. The 
valve cap does not act as a check valve to keep liquid on the tray.

The author’s industrial experience has proved this unpleasant fact on 
numerous occasions.
On the other hand, bubble caps (or even the more ancient tunnel 
cap trays) are different, in that they do not depend on the vapor flow 
to retain the liquid level on the tray deck. More on this later. For now, 
just recall that we are dealing only with perforated tray decks.
4.1.2  Dry-Tray Pressure Drop
For the force of the up-flowing vapor to stop the liquid from leaking 
through the sieve hole shown in Fig. 4.2, the pressure drop of the 
vapor flowing through the hole has to equal the weight of liquid on 
the tray deck. The weight of liquid trying to force its way through the 
sieve hole is proportional to the depth of liquid on the tray deck. The 
pressure drop of the vapor as it accelerates through the sieve hole is

4.1.3  Hydraulic Tray Pressure Drop
The weight of liquid on a tray is created by the weir height plus the 
crest height. We have defined the crest height (in inches of clear 
liquid) in Chap. 3, as
Crest height = 0.4 (GPM ÷ inch outlet weir length)0.67
The actual height of fluid overflowing the weir is quite a bit greater 
than we calculate with this formula. The reason is that the fluid over-
flowing the weir is not clear liquid, but aerated liquid—that is, foam. 
The fluid on the tray deck, below the top of the weir, is also foam. 
This reduces the effective weight of the liquid on the tray due to aera-
tion. To summarize, the weight of liquid on the tray, called the hydrau-
lic tray pressure drop, is
DPhyd = AF × WH + 0.4 (GPM ÷ inch outlet weir length)0.67
where	 DPhyd = hydraulic tray pressure drop, in inches of clear liquid
	
WH = weir height, inches
	
AF = aeration factor
	
GPM = gallons (U.S.) per minute
The aeration factor AF is the relative density of the foam to the den-
sity of the clear liquid. It is a combination of complex factors, but is 
typically 0.5.
4.1.4  Calculated Total Tray Pressure Drop
The sum of the dry tray pressure drop (DPdry) plus the hydraulic tray 
pressure drop (DPhyd) equals the total tray pressure drop (DPtotal):
DPtotal = DPdry + DPhyd
expressed in inches of clear liquid.
When the dry tray pressure drop is significantly less than the 
hydraulic tray pressure drop, the tray will start to leak or weep and 
tray efficiency will be adversely affected.
When the dry tray pressure drop is significantly greater than the 
hydraulic tray pressure drop, the liquid on the tray can blow off of 
the tray deck and tray efficiency will be adversely affected.
For a tray to function reasonably close to its best efficiency point, 
the dry tray pressure drop must be roughly equal (±50 percent) to the 
hydraulic tray pressure drop:
DPdry = DPhyd
This concept is the basis for tray design for perforated tray decks. 
While various valve tray vendors maintain that this rule does not 
hold for their equipment, it is the author’s industrial experience that

valve trays leak just as badly as do sieve trays at low vapor hole 
velocities. To summarize:

4.2  Other Causes of Tray Inefficiency
4.2.1  Out-of-Level Trays
When trays weep, efficiency may not be significantly reduced. After 
all, the dripping liquid will still come into good contact with the 
up-flowing vapor. But this statement would be valid only if the tray 
decks were absolutely level. And in the real world, especially in large 
(>6-ft)-diameter columns, there is no such thing as a “level” tray. 
Figure 4.3 shows the edge view of a tray that is 2 inches out-of-level.
As illustrated, liquid accumulates on the low side of this tray. 
Vapor, taking the path of least resistance, preferentially bubbles up 
through the high side of the tray deck. To prevent liquid from leaking 
through the low side of the tray, the dry tray pressure drop must equal 
or exceed the sum of the weight of the aerated liquid retained on the 
tray by the weir plus the crest height of liquid over the weir plus the 
2-inch out-of-levelness of the tray deck.
Once the weight of liquid on one portion—the lowest area—of a 
tray deck exceeds the dry tray pressure drop, the hydraulic balance of 
the entire tray is ruined. Vapor flow through the low area of the tray 
deck ceases. The aeration of the liquid retained by the weir on the low 
area of the tray deck stops, and hence the hydraulic tray pressure drop 
increases even more. As shown in Fig. 4.3, the liquid now drains largely

C h a p t e r  F o u r
through the low area of the tray. The vapor flow bubbles mainly 
through the higher area of the tray deck. This phenomenon is termed 
vapor-liquid channeling. Channeling is the primary reason for reduced 
distillation tray efficiency, because the vapor and liquid no longer come 
into good, intimate contact.
The common reason for out-of-levelness of trays is sagging of the 
tray decks. Sags are caused by pressure surges and sloppy installa-
tion. Sometimes the tray support rings might not be installed level, or 
the tower itself might be out of plumb (meaning the tower itself may 
not be truly vertical).
4.2.2  Loss of Downcomer Seal
We stated in Chap. 3 that the top edge of the outlet weir is maintained 
about 0.5 inch above the bottom edge of the inlet downcomer to prevent 
vapor from flowing up the downcomer. This is called a 0.5-inch positive 
downcomer seal. But for this seal to be effective, the liquid must over-
flow the weir. If all the liquid is weeping through the tray deck, there 
will be no flow over the weir, and the height of the weir will become 
irrelevant. Figure 4.4 shows the result of severe tray deck leakage:
	
1.	 The downcomer seal is lost on tray deck 1.
	
2.	 Vapor flows up the downcomer between tray decks 1 and 2.

3.	 Liquid flow is backed up onto the tray above, i.e., onto tray 
deck 2.
	
4.	 The dry tray pressure drop through tray 2 decreases due to 
low vapor flow through the tray deck.
	
5.	 The hydraulic tray pressure drop on tray 2 increases due to 
increased liquid level.
	
6.	 Tray 2 will now start to weep, with the weeping concentrated 
on the low area of the tray.
	
7.	 Tray 2 now has most of its vapor feed flowing up through its 
outlet downcomer, rather than the tray deck, and most of its 
liquid flow is leaking through its tray deck.
The net result of this unpleasant scenario is loss of both vapor-liquid 
contacting and tray efficiency. Note how the mechanical problems 
(i.e., levelness) of tray 1 ruins the tray efficiency of both trays 1 and 2.
4.2.3  Flooding at Reduced Vapor Rates
Referring to Fig. 4.4, if a tray deck is leaking so badly that none of the 
liquid is overflowing its weir, then the downcomer from the tray above 
will become unsealed. Then, due to vapor displacing the liquid in this 
downcomer, all the trays above the unsealed downcomer will flood. This 
gives rise to an unusual and rather confusing situation. That is, lower 
vapor rates, which cause a reduced DP through the trays, can cause 
flooding. Worse yet, the way one stops this flooding is to increase the DP 
across the sagging tray deck by increasing the vapor flow, for instance, 
by increasing the reboiler duty or stripping rate.
This contradicts common sense that flooding is promoted by higher 
vapor rates. But I have stopped flooding in a crude distillation tower 
recently in a Kansas refinery by increasing the stripping steam rate. Also, 
I have often seen that increasing vapor rates in a column reduces tray DP. 
I assume this has happened because I have accidentally resealed the 
downcomer above the out-of-level tray deck.
4.3  Bubble-Cap Trays
The first continuous distillation tower built was the “Patent Still” 
used in Britain to produce Scotch whiskey, in 1835. The patent still is 
to this day employed to make apple brandy in southern England. 
The original still, and the one I saw in England in 1992, had ordinary 
bubble-cap trays (except downpipes instead of downcomers were 
used). The major advantage of a bubble-cap tray is that the tray deck 
is leakproof. As shown in Fig. 4.5, the riser inside the cap is above the 
top of the outlet weir. This creates a mechanical seal on the tray deck, 
which prevents liquid weeping, regardless of the vapor flow.
Bubble-cap trays may be operated over a far wider range of vapor 
flows, without loss of tray efficiency. It is the author’s experience that

C h a p t e r  F o u r
bubble-cap trays fractionate better in commercial service than do per-
forated (valve or sieve) trays. Why, then, are bubble-cap trays rarely 
used in a modern distillation tower?
There really is no proper answer to this question. It is quite likely 
that the archaic, massively thick, bolted-up, cast-iron bubble-cap or 
tunnel-cap tray was the best tray ever built. However, compared to a 
modern valve tray, bubble-cap trays
• Were difficult to install, because of their weight.
• Have about 15 percent less capacity because when vapor escapes 
from the slots on the bubble cap, it is moving in a horizontal 
direction. The vapor flow must turn 90°. This change of direc-
tion promotes entrainment and, hence, jet flooding.
• Are more expensive to purchase.
• Are more difficult to clean.
But in the natural gas fields, where modern design techniques 
have been slow to penetrate, bubble-cap trays are still widely 
employed to dehydrate and sweeten natural gas in remote locations.
4.3.1  Distillation Tower Turndown
The problem we have been discussing—loss of tray efficiency due to 
low vapor velocity—is commonly called turndown. It is the opposite 
of flooding, which is indicated by loss of tray efficiency at high vapor 
velocity. To discriminate between flooding and weeping trays, we

measure the tower pressure drop. If the pressure drop per tray, 
expressed in inches of liquid, is more than three times the weir height, 
then the poor fractionation is due to flooding. If the pressure drop per 
tray is less than the height of the weir, then poor fractionation is due 
to weeping or dumping.
One way to stop trays from leaking or weeping is to increase the 
reflux rate. Assuming that the reboiler is on automatic temperature 
control, increasing the reflux flow must result in increased reboiler 
duty. This will increase the vapor flow through the trays and the dry 
tray pressure drop. The higher dry tray pressure drop may then stop 
tray deck leakage. The net effect is that the higher reflux rate restores 
the tray efficiency.
However, the largest operating cost for many process units is the 
energy supplied to the reboilers. We should therefore avoid high 
reflux rates, and try to achieve the best efficiency point for distillation 
tower trays at a minimum vapor flow. This is best done by designing 
and installing the tray decks and outlet weirs as level as possible. 
Damaged tray decks should not be reused unless they can be restored 
to their proper state of levelness, which is difficult, if not impossible.
4.4  New High Capacity Trays
All vendors now market a high capacity tray. These trays have a 5 to 
15 percent capacity advantage over conventional trays. Basically, the 
idea behind these high capacity trays is the same. The area under-
neath the downcomer is converted to bubble area. This increase in 
area devoted to vapor flow reduces the percent of jet flood.
But what keeps vapor from blowing up the downcomer? What 
prevents loss of the downcomer seal? If the downcomer seal is lost, 
surely the downcomer will back up and flood the upper trays of the 
column.
The design I’m most familiar with is the NorPro high capacity tray 
shown in Fig. 4.6. The head loss through the orifice holes in the down-
comer seal plate shown is sufficiently high to prevent loss of the 
downcomer seal. These trays flood rather easily when their design 
downcomer liquid rates are exceeded. However, when operated at 
design downcomer liquid rates they perform very well indeed, and 
have shown quite a high vapor-handling capacity as compared to 
conventional trays.
The downcomer seal plate shown in Fig. 4.6 is an example of a 
dynamic downcomer seal. The Koch-Glitsch “Nye” tray also uses a 
dynamic downcomer seal to increase vapor-handling capacity. All 
trays with a dynamic downcomer seal suffer from two disadvantages:
• Loss of flexibility in that the liquid rates cannot be varied 
over too great a range without either flooding or unsealing 
the downcomers.

	
50	
C h a p t e r  F o u r
• Tray installation complexity is always increased, sometimes 
with terrible consequences.
For these reasons, high capacity trays using dynamic downcomer 
seals are best avoided on new columns. They should be reserved for 
use on retrofit tower expansion projects.
4.5  Calculating Tray Efficiency
The reader with a chemical engineering background will observe that 
I’ve neglected the calculation of tray efficiency. There are three meth-
ods available to calculate tray efficiency:
• Overall tray efficiency
• Murphy tray efficiency
• Mass transfer tray efficiency
I’ve never had occasion to calculate tray efficiency for any distil-
lation tower. I’m guided by observations on similar existing services. 
Certainly, tray hydraulics as described above (i.e., levelness, weeping,

entrainment) is the dominating factor in determining tray efficiency. 
However, when I run a computer simulation for a distillation column, 
and must then select a tray efficiency, I’m guided by the following:
• Absorption of ethane, propane—50% 
• De-ethanizer, demethanizer—60% 
• Sour water stripper for H2S, NH3—50% 
• Debutanizer—80% 
• Crude distillation—90% 
• Amine regeneration—70% 
• FCU, Coker fractionators—90% 
• Pumparounds—80% 
• Vacuum distillation hydrocarbons—70% 
• Steam stripping hydrocarbons—50% 
I don’t have a solid basis for any of the above parameters. The 
values quoted are mostly what I’ve seen other designers use or have 
experienced myself. Large negative variations from these parameters 
are rarely due to any calculation problems. Almost always, the prob-
lem is bad tray design or sloppy installation, or both.
The majority of the towers I work with have too many trays. 
Designing for extra trays is the designer’s futile attempt to offset tray 
hydraulic problems described in this chapter.
Tray inspection after installation or during a unit turnaround is a 
lot more important than the selection of the best tray efficiency calcu-
lation model.

CHAPTER 5
Notes on Tray 
Design Details
M
ost of my clients are careless regarding tray design. For  
example, their engineering department will run a tower com-
puter simulation. Size the tower accordingly at 85 percent 
of jet flood and email the results to the tray vendors. The tray vendors 
cannot be trusted to work through the details that ensure a good tray 
design. Thus, after you have done your computer simulation, you 
need to write up a set of tray specs for the tray bid package with the 
appropriate details. 
I have described these required details in the following notes, as 
I’ve taught them in my seminar, which, if you are reading this, you 
have likely already attended, but may already have forgotten? 
5.1  Process Design Equipment Details
5.1.1  Tray Deck Design
For trays to work efficiently, I use the following criteria:
	
1.	 Weir height = 2½ to 3 inches.
	
2.	 Hole or perforated area = 4 to 14 percent of bubble area. By 
bubble area, I’m referring to the tray area excluding the area 
under the downcomer.
	
3.	 To select the hole area, I’ll first calculate the weight of liquid 
on the tray. This consists of two parts: the weir height and the 
crest height.
	
	 a.	 Since there is foam, not liquid on the trays, I assume the 
foam is half as dense as clear or flat liquid. So I divide the 
weir height by two.
53

	
54	
C h a p t e r  F i v e
	
	 b.	 Then I calculate the crest height, or the height of the liquid 
(inches) over the top edge of the weir:
	
0.4 (GPM ÷ inches of weir length)0.67
	
	 c.	 The weight of liquid on the tray is step a plus step b, above.
	
4.	 For perforated tray decks (sieve or grid trays), I calculate the 
pressure drop of the vapor flowing through the holes (inches). 
The pressure drop I want is the weight of liquid on the trays 
that I calculated above in step c. The idea is to keep the tray 
from leaking through the tray deck perforations.
	
5.	 The vapor ΔP (inches) is:
	 (K) • (Vapor Density ÷ Liquid Density) • (Vapor Velocity)2
	
	 where vapor velocity is for the vapor flowing through the 
holes in feet per second.
	
6.	 K for sieve trays is 0.3; K for grid trays is 0.6. Only an idiot 
would use movable valve trays. The valve caps stick to the 
deck and do not greatly retard tray deck leakage.
To summarize, I’ll select a hole area for the tray, so that the veloc-
ity of vapor flowing through the holes will be big enough to keep the 
tray from leaking. Of course, if the tray decks are badly out of level, 
the above calculations are meaningless. So don’t forget to inspect 
your tray installation for tray deck levelness (see my book, Process 
Equipment Malfunctions, McGraw-Hill, 2011).
5.1.2  Weir Design
Weir loading in U.S. gallons per minute (GPM) per inch of weir length 
should be kept between 3 and 12. Above 13 or 14, a loss of tray effi-
ciency due to entrainment (i.e., jet flood) can be expected. Below 3 
GPM per inch of weir, the liquid flow across the tray will not be par-
ticularly uniform and a loss in tray efficiency will result.
	
1.	 If the weir loading is excessive, increase the number of tray 
deck passes from one to two, or from two to four. I don’t use 
three-pass trays, because they lack symmetry.
	
2.	 Increasing the number of passes reduces the flow path length 
between the liquid flowing from the inlet side of the tray to the 
weir. This reduces tray efficiency for flow paths of less than 
around 18 inches. So, to avoid this problem, I’ll use a swept-
back downcomer (Fig. 5.1) to decrease my weir loadings when 
my flow path length is getting too small. The tray vendors will 
have to work out the details of the swept-back downcomer.
	
3.	 If the weir loading is too small, picket weirs are needed to 
increase the loading to 4 GPM/inch. A picket weir is a strip of 

	
N o t e s  o n  Tr a y  D e s i g n  D e t a i l s 	
55
steel welded to the top edge of the existing weir; each picket 
is 2 to 8 inches. wide and around 12 inches. high (Fig. 5.2). But 
in practice all the pickets are usually made by cutting rectan-
gular notches at regular intervals into a single strip of metal, 
which then spans the full width of the weir and is attached to 
the existing weir. Process-wise, the end result is the same and 
still looks like Fig. 5.2.
I can’t overemphasize how important picket weirs are to avoid 
weir loadings of less than 1 or 2 GPM/inch. Of course, if the weirs are 
not level, then the above criteria are meaningless. So inspect your trays 
for weir levelness. However excellent the design, if trays, weirs, or 
downcomers are not properly installed, then the design is irrelevant.
Picket weirs also even out the depth of liquid on the tray itself, 
and thus promote more uniform flow of vapor through the tray, 
which also enhances tray efficiency.

5.1.3  Tray Ring Area
The tray support rings are typically 3 inches wide. That means there 
are no holes in the tray decks about 4 inches. from the vessel wall. 
Liquid can bypass the bubbling vapor through these gaps and reduce 
tray efficiency. I have two ways of dealing with these gaps:
	
1.	 Drill ½-inch holes through the tray and tray ring. This will 
also marginally increase tower capacity.
	
2.	 Place a 3-inch-high by 4-inch-wide dam next to the vessel 
wall (i.e., four dams are needed for a two-pass tray).
For large-diameter trays, a similar gap will result where the tray 
panels are attached to the cross I-beam supports. Holes and/or dams 
are appropriate for these bypass areas as well.
Drilling holes through the edge of the tray and through the tray 
ring is an especially nice way to coax a bit more capacity out of small-
diameter towers.
5.1.4  Increasing Tower Bubble Area to Reduce Jet Flood
Here’s a neat trick that I learned from Dale Nutter, whose dad founded 
Nutter Engineering, the forerunner of Sulzer in the United States. It’s 
worth perhaps 5 percent (max) of tower percent of jet flood capacity.
As shown in Fig. 5.3, create a ¼-inch gap between the downpour 
plate and the inlet perforated tray panel.
Vapor from the tray below escapes through the gap, passes 
toward the bubble area, and thus somewhat uses the tower area 
below the solid downpour plate. It’s kind of like a poor man’s “Nye” 
figure 5.3  Quarter-inch gap increases tower capacity a few percent.

panel. Dale suggested using ¼-inch-thick wedges. I’ve just used 
¼-inch steel washers.
5.1.5  Changing to Thicker Trays
I like to use thicker trays than other designers, mainly for mechanical 
integrity. As one increases the tray deck thickness, the pressure drop 
of the vapor flowing through the tray perforations goes down, not 
up. That’s because the K value (i.e., orifice coefficient) is reduced. The 
effect on the tray performance is to promote tray deck leakage, but 
also marginally to increase tray capacity. Going from 2-mm tray 
thickness (about 14 gauge) to ¼-inch-thick trays will cut the vapor ΔP 
through the orifice by a lot. So be careful.
5.1.6  Tray Spacing
Tray capacity will increase with the square root of tray spacing. I use 
a 24-inch tray spacing for smaller diameter towers (3–8 ft), 30-inch 
tray spacing for midsize towers (9–12 ft), and 36-inch tray spacing for 
anything larger. Bigger spacing is needed to accommodate the cross 
I-beam supports.
One of my favorite tricks on H2 hydro-desulfurizer recycle gas 
H2S absorbers or sour water strippers, or any tower that has far too 
many trays, is to double the tray spacing. This permits me to increase 
tower capacity by 40 to 50 percent. Recycle gas H2S absorbers, espe-
cially, have typically four times the number of trays required (see my 
book, Process Engineering for a Small Planet, Wiley, 2010).
Do not use tray spacing of less than 24 inches. These trays are 
hard to inspect. It’s too difficult to crawl between the tray decks.
5.1.7  Downcomers
For 24-inch tray spacing, a maximum downcomer loading is 175 GPM 
per square foot of the downcomer top area. That’s for clean services. 
For foaming services, I use 90 GPM. It does not hurt anything to make 
the downcomer too big. That is, there is no minimum downcomer 
loading.
It is industry-accepted practice to slope the downcomer, so that 
the bottom edge of the downcomer is only 60 percent of the top area. 
This increases the bubble area by maybe 5 to 7 percent. I never do this 
on new towers. It’s an unnecessary risk and installation complication. 
However, for retrofits, it’s not a bad idea.
One thing I never do in fouling services is to use recessed sumps 
below the downcomers. What’s to prevent these sumps from filling 
up with sludge?
5.1.8  Downcomer Width
Having a downcomer with adequate area may not be sufficient to 
prevent downcomer flooding. If the downcomer is long and narrow, 

	
58	
C h a p t e r  F i v e
it may still flood at low liquid rates. The problem is that the liquid 
cascading over the weir will impact the wall of the vessel. If the weir 
loading is high (perhaps 10 GPM/inch) and the downcomer width is 
narrow (perhaps 6 inches), this problem may occur. I’m not too sure 
of the parameters. However, I once increased the downcomer width 
on a tower but without increasing the downcomer area and stopped 
the flooding. The service was a fuel gas H2S amine absorber, which is 
typically a nasty foaming service.
5.1.9  Foaming Services
If you think that your tray will be in a foamy service, it’s best to dou-
ble the usual downcomer area from 175 GPM per ft2 to 90 GPM per 
ft2. Towers working as demethanizers or de-ethanizers fall into this 
category. If I have a sour water stripper with hydrocarbon liquids in 
the stripper feed or water in a hydrocarbon fractionator, I would 
anticipate foaming. The foaming service I know most about is H2S 
absorption in amine. The greater the concentration of the amine, the 
greater the foaming. When I noted the 90 GPM per ft2 value above, I 
had in mind 25 to 30 percent DEA or 20 percent MEA.
Refrigerated absorbers are also, in my experience, somewhat 
foamy, as is any system that is contaminated with particulates. Sand 
in recovered heavy bitumen is one such example.
5.1.10  Rounded Downcomer Outlets
This is a retrofit trick and not appropriate for new towers. The bottom 
edge of a downcomer is rounded rather than straight, as shown in 
Fig. 5.4.
The head loss under the downcomer (inches of liquid) is calcu-
lated as:
Head Loss = K • V1
2
where V1 = feet/sec, the horizontal component of velocity under-
neath the downcomer.	
K is reduced from 0.6 to 0.3 by using the rounded downcomer outlet.
To obtain this feature from the tray vendor, you need to specify a 
“Full Radius Downcomer Outlet.” This will lower the liquid level in 
the downcomer by an inch or so. If you’re limited by downcomer 
backup, this would provide about an extra 5 percent of capacity. No 
great improvement. But it doesn’t cost very much either.
Of course, anything that reduces the head loss (i.e., delta P) of liquid 
flow past the bottom edge of the downcomer increases the possibility of 
unsealing the downcomer, as I’ll describe in the following sections.
5.1.11  Setting the Downcomer Clearance
Specifying the downcomer clearance above the tray below is one of 
our more critical design criteria. If the clearance is too small, the 

	
N o t e s  o n  Tr a y  D e s i g n  D e t a i l s 	
59
downcomer will back up and flood. If the clearance is too big, the 
downcomer liquid seal will be displaced by the vapor from the tray 
below, which will displace the liquid in the downcomer, which will 
cause the downcomer and the trays above to flood.
My standard for setting the downcomer clearance is then:
	
1.	 About ¼- to ½-inch below the top of the outlet weir. Some 
engineers will rely on a dynamic seal, meaning they count on 
the crest height of the liquid overflowing the outlet weir to 
submerge the bottom edge of the downcomer from the tray 
above. Not me. I worry too much about tray deck leakage, 
liquid turndown, and out-of-level weirs. So I’ll stick with the 
¼-inch minimum overlap that I’ve relied on for 47 years.
	
2.	 My minimum downcomer clearance is 1 inch. Maybe a pres-
sure surge will push up the downpour plate below the down-
comer? Maybe corrosion deposits will accumulate in this 
area?
	
3.	 I maintain a minimum design horizontal velocity (called the 
escape velocity) of about 1 to 1½ ft per second below the bot-
tom edge of the downcomer to prevent vapor intrusion into 
the downcomer (See V1, Fig. 5.4).
Of course, these sorts of design dimensions are meaningless 
unless both the weirs and bottom edge of the downcomers are level. 
So inspect the installed trays for weir and downcomer levelness.

C h a p t e r  F i v e
5.1.12  Inlet Weirs
There’s a problem with my design criteria for downcomer clearances. 
That is, at low liquid rates, how can I keep a reasonable downcomer 
escape velocity without reducing the downcomer velocity below my 
1-inch clearance? The conventional answer is an inlet weir, as shown 
in Fig. 5.5.
But there’s a nasty potential problem with inlet weirs. If down-
comer A bulges out (see Fig. 5.5), then the gap shown as distance X 
between the inlet weir, which seals the downcomer, and the down-
comer itself will be reduced. As I’ve seen before, when this happens, 
tower flooding results. So maintaining the gap shown as distance X in 
Fig. 5.5 is very important.
I have used inlet weirs to guarantee a downcomer seal at low 
liquid rates. But I’ll leave a generous horizontal space (maybe 3 or  
4 inches) between the inlet weir and downcomer A in Fig. 5.5 (i.e., 
distance X could be 3 or 4 inches).
Also, I’ll inspect the installed trays to assure myself that the 
downcomer itself is not too flexible at its bottom edge. This is a good 
application for downcomer bracing brackets.
Finally, the inlet weir is also a dirt trap (like the recessed sump). 
So I would be afraid to use it in fouling or corrosive services.
5.1.13  Seal Pan
Below the downcomer of the bottom tray is the seal pan. The seal 
pan, like a recessed sump, is also a potential dirt trap. I’ve crawled 
Figure 5.5  Inlet weir provides a positive downcomer seal.

through many towers and have seen the seal pans half full of dirt. So 
I have developed the following design criteria (Fig. 5.6):
	
1.	 Clearances between the seal pan and downcomer are double 
normal those that would be used for the downcomer and the 
tray deck.
	
2.	 The downcomer itself is longer than normal.
	
3.	 A drain hole is provided in the floor of the seal pan, and is 
sized for 20–25 percent of the design flow, to flush out the 
accumulated dirt.
To calculate the size of this drain hole, first calculate the drain 
hole velocity, V:
H = 0.6 • V (feet per second)
The H factor is the depth of the seal pan (shown in Fig. 5.6) plus 
about 1 inch to allow for the crest height over the top edge of the 
seal pan.
Multiply the design volumetric flow by 25 percent and divide by 
V to determine the hole area in square feet.
Of course, if you oversize the seal pan drain hole, you will lose 
the downcomer seal and flood the tower. A drain hole of less than  
¼ inch will likely plug.
Before closing up a tower, don’t neglect to inspect the seal pan to 
make sure it’s free of gloves and dead rats.

5.1.14  Downcomer Bracing Brackets
In small-diameter towers using single-pass trays, this is not an issue. 
But, once a tower is larger than 8 ft in diameter or multipass trays are 
used, downcomer bracing brackets are critical.
These brackets are attached to the bottom edge of the side down-
comers to keep the downcomer bottom edge from flexing. For exam-
ple, pressure below a tray can force the downcomer bottom area to be 
reduced and to restrict liquid flow. This may cause the downcomer 
to fill and flood. I like to keep the bracket spacing to less than 3 ft. 
For two-pass trays, the center downcomer spacing is maintained by 
a ½-inch hollow cylinder bolted between the opposite walls of the 
center downcomer, also with 3-ft spacing.
Failure to secure the side downcomer bracing brackets is a com-
mon installation error. So one needs to specify the spacing correctly, 
and then check the installation in the column.
5.1.15  Selection of Tray Caps
Here’s my advice on this critical subject:
	
1.	 Don’t use movable caps (i.e., valves). They do not greatly 
decrease tray deck leakage at low vapor rates. But they do 
stick to the tray deck and cause premature flooding.
	
2.	 For clean services, I use Sulzer MVG grid trays.
	
3.	 For fouling services, I use Koch-Glitsch pro-valve grid trays 
with a ½-inch lift.
	
4.	 If capacity and vapor flow variability (i.e., turndown) is 
not an issue, I use sieve trays with 3/8-inch holes (clean 
service) or ½-inch holes (dirty services). Sieve trays have 
about 10 percent less capacity than grid trays. But anyone 
can make them in a day (i.e., new tray panels) and the price 
is minimal.
5.1.16  Materials of Construction
Only fools use thin, carbon steel trays:
	
1.	 The industry standard is 14 gauge. My standard is 10 gauge, 
or 8 gauge for vacuum tower steam stripping trays. The 
smaller the gauge, the thicker the metal.
	
2.	 In virgin crude oil service I use 316 S.S. for naphthenic acid 
protection, which requires moly and nickel.
	
3.	 In thermally cracked service, where naphthenic acids have 
been destroyed, I use 410 steel.

	
N o t e s  o n  Tr a y  D e s i g n  D e t a i l s 	
63
After 47 years of practice, I have never used carbon steel because 
as it corrodes, it chokes off the lift area underneath the cap and leads 
to higher vapor ΔP and flooding.
Make the downcomers thick too. Flexibility in downcomers is 
bad. They need to be kept stiff and strong.
5.1.17  Tray Mechanical Details
I have shown detailed drawings of the following features in my book, 
Process Design for Reliable Operations, available on Amazon (make sure 
you get the third edition):
	
1.	 Back-to-back trays: See Fig. 5.7.
	
2.	 Shear clips: Weld the shear clip to the underside of the tray as 
shown in Fig. 5.8, but certainly not to the tray ring.
	
3.	 Bolted-in trays: Use the slotted or oversized holes on the trays 
as a guide to drill or burn holes in the tray rings. Then bolt 
in the trays on 4- or 6-inch spacing. Use a double-nutting 
arrangement. Secure the first nut finger tight and ¼ turn with

a wrench. This permits tray movement as the tray heats up. 
The backup nut is tightened up against the first nut to keep 
the first nut from coming loose.
	
4.	 Explosion doors: These are now standard in the industry. Use 
mechanical door stops to close the doors, rather than chains, 
which tend to break.
	
5.	 Use grid trays: They are stronger than sieve or valve trays. 
Again, I use 10 gauge rather than the standard 14-gauge deck 
thickness.

CHAPTER 6
Why Control 
Tower Pressure
Options for Optimizing Tower 
Operating Pressure
Why are distillation towers designed with controls that fix the tower 
pressure?
Naturally, we do not want to overpressure the tower and pop 
open the safety relief valve. Alternatively, if the tower pressure gets 
too low, we could not condense the reflux. Then the liquid level in the 
reflux drum would fall and the reflux pump would lose suction and 
cavitate. But assuming that we have plenty of condensing capacity 
and are operating well below the relief valve set pressure, why do we 
attempt to fix the tower pressure? Further, how do we know what 
pressure target to select?
I well remember one pentane-hexane splitter in Toronto. The tower 
simply could not make a decent split, regardless of the feed or reflux rate 
selected. The tower-top pressure was swinging between 12 and 20 psig. 
The flooded condenser pressure control valve, shown in Fig. 6.1, was 
operating between 5 and 15 percent open, and hence it was responding 
in a non-linear fashion (most control valves work properly only at 20 to 
75 percent open). The problem may be explained as follows.
The liquid on the tray deck was at its bubble, or boiling, point. A 
sudden decrease in the tower pressure caused the liquid to boil vio-
lently. The resulting surge in vapor flow promoted jet entrainment, or 
flooding.
Alternately, the vapor flowing between trays was at its dew point. 
A sudden increase in tower pressure caused a rapid condensation of 
this vapor and a loss in vapor velocity through the tray deck holes. 
The resulting loss in vapor flow caused the tray decks to dump.
Either way, erratic tower pressure results in alternating flooding 
and dumping, and therefore reduced tray efficiency. While gradual 
65

swings in pressure are quite acceptable, no tower can be expected to 
make a decent split with a rapidly fluctuating pressure.
6.1  Selecting an Optimum Tower Pressure
The process design engineer selects the tower design operating pres-
sure as follows:
	
1.	 Determines the maximum cooling water or ambient air tem-
perature that is typically expected on a hot summer day in 
the locale where the plant is to be built.
	
2.	 Calculates the condenser outlet, or reflux drum temperature, 
that would result from the above water or air temperature (as 
discussed in Chap. 18).
	
3.	 Referring to Fig. 6.2, the designer calculates the pressure in 
the reflux drum, assuming that the condensed liquid is at its 
bubble point (as discussed in Chap. 14). Adding 5 or 10 psig 
to this pressure for pressure loss in the overhead condenser 
and associated piping, the designer then determines the 
tower-top pressure.

Of course, the unit operator can physically deviate from this design 
pressure, but to what purpose?
6.2  Raising the Tower Pressure Target
I once had a contract in a Denver refinery to revamp a hydrocracker 
fractionator, which produced naphtha, jet fuel, and diesel. The bottle-
neck was tray flooding. At higher feed rates, the kerosene would carry 
over into the overhead naphtha product. My initial plant inspection 
showed that the tower-top pressure was 24 psig. The relief valve was 
set at 50 psig. By raising the tower operating pressure to 30 psig, the 
flooding was stopped and my contract was canceled. Why?
Ambient pressure in Denver is about 13 psia (lb/in2 absolute) 
(vs. 14.7 psia at sea level). Higher pressures reduce the volumetric flow 
of vapor. In other words, volume is inversely proportional to pressure:
	
Volume ~
1
pressure
	
The pressure we are concerned with is the absolute pressure:
	
Initial pressure = 24 psig + 13 psi = 37 psia
	
Final pressure = 30 psig + 13 psi = 43 psia
The absolute tower pressure (in psia) increased by 17 percent, and 
hence the volume (as well as the velocity of vapor through the valve

tray caps) declined by 17 percent. The reduced vapor velocity reduced 
the dry tray pressure drop, thus reducing both the spray height 
above the tray deck and the liquid backup in the downcomers.
Another reason to raise tower pressure is to permit higher reflux 
rates. If the pressure controller in Fig. 6.1 is set too low, then during 
hot weather, when condenser capacity becomes marginal, the level in 
the reflux drum will be lost. If we then raise the pressure set point, the 
drum will refill—but why?
Raising the tower pressure also increases the reflux drum pres-
sure, raising, in turn, the temperature at which the vapors condense. 
The rate of condensation is then calculated from the following:
	
Q = U × A (TC - TA)
where	 Q = rate of condensation, Btu/h
	
A = heat-exchanger surface area, ft2
	
U = heat-transfer coefficient, Btu/[(h)(ft2)(°F)]
	
TC = condensation temperature of vapors, °F
	
TA = temperature of air or cooling water, °F
Raising the tower pressure increases TC. 
6.3  Lowering the Tower Pressure
In general, distillation columns should be operated at a low pressure. 
For example, Fig. 6.3 shows an isobutane-normal butane stripper. 
This fractionator is performing poorly. A computer simulation of the 
column has been built. The column has 50 actual trays. But in order to 
force the computer model to match existing operating parameters 
(reflux rate, product compositions), 10 theoretical separation stages 
(i.e., 10 trays, each 100 percent efficient) must be used in the model. 
This means that the trays are developing an actual tray efficiency of 
only 20 percent.
A field measurement indicated a pressure drop of 2.0 psi. Assum-
ing a specific gravity of 0.50, then the pressure drop per tray in inches 
of liquid is:
 
2.0 psi tower

As the weir height of the trays is 3 inch, it is a safe assumption 
that the low tray efficiency is due to tray deck dumping, rather than 
flooding. As shown in Fig. 6.3, this column has no reflux. This is a 
typical design for strippers; when feed is introduced on the top tray, 
there is no need for reflux.

	
W h y  C o n t r o l  To w e r  P r e s s u r e 	
69
In order to improve tray efficiency, it will be necessary to increase 
the vapor velocity through the trays, so as to increase the pressure 
drop to at least 4 or 5 inch of liquid per tray. If the reboiler duty were 
simply increased, the concentration of the heavy component—nor-
mal butane—in the light overhead product—isobutane—would esca-
late exponentially. Another method, however, that does not involve 
increasing either the reboiler duty or the mass flow of vapor through 
the trays can be used to increase vapor velocity.
By lowering the tower operating pressure, the volume of vapor 
flow bubbling up through the tray decks may be increased without 
changing the mass flow. For instance, if the tower pressure were 
reduced from 105 psig (or 120 psia) to 45 psig (or 60 psia), then the 
velocity of vapor through the sieve holes on the trays would double. 
This would lead to a substantial increase in the dry tray pressure 
drop, and hence reduce tray deck leakage.
To lower the tower pressure, the hot-vapor bypass pressure 
recorder controller (PRC) valve is closed. This forces more vapor 
through the condenser, which, in turn, lowers the temperature in the

reflux drum. As the liquid in the reflux drum is at its bubble point, 
reducing the reflux drum temperature will reduce the reflux drum 
pressure. As the stripper tower pressure floats on the reflux drum 
pressure, the pressure in the tower will also decline.
The net effect of reducing the stripper pressure was to greatly 
reduce the amount of isobutane in the heavier normal butane bottoms 
product. Undoubtedly, most of the improvement in fractionation was 
due to enhanced tray efficiency, which resulted from suppressing tray 
deck leaking, or dumping. But there was a secondary benefit of reduc-
ing tower pressure: increased relative volatility.
6.3.1  Relative Volatility
The chart shown in Fig. 6.4 is called a Cox, or vapor-pressure, chart. It 
shows the pressure developed by pure-component liquids at various 
temperatures. The interesting aspect of this chart is that the sloped 
lines, representing the vapor pressures of pure hydrocarbon compo-
nents, spread apart at lower pressures. This results in an increase in 
the ratio of the vapor pressures of any two components.
The vapor pressure of a light component at a given temperature 
divided by the vapor pressure of a heavier component at the same 
temperature is called the relative volatility. For practice, calculate the 
relative volatility of isobutane and normal pentane at 140°F (answer: 
4.0). Next, calculate their relative volatility at 110°F (answer: 4.9).*
Note that the relative volatility has increased by about 20 percent 
at the lower temperature and pressure. This increase in relative vola-
tility allows one to make a better split at a given reflux rate, or to

make the same split at a lower reflux rate. We can quantify this last 
statement as follows:
=
(RVL – RVH)
(RVH – 1)
DRF
where	 RVH = relative volatility at a high pressure
	
RVL = relative volatility at a low pressure
	
DRF = percent reduction in the reflux rate, when the same 
degree of fractionation is desired
Reducing reflux saves reboiler duty. Also, the lower pressure will 
reduce the tower-bottom temperature, and this also cuts the reboiler 
energy requirement. For most distillation towers, the energy cost of the 
reboiler duty is the main component of the total operating cost to run 
the tower.
6.3.2  Incipient Flood Point
As an operator reduces the tower pressure, three effects occur simul-
taneously:
• Relative volatility increases.
• Tray deck leakage decreases.
• Entrainment, or spray height, increases.
The first two factors help make fractionation better, the last factor 
makes fractionation worse. How can an operator select the optimum 
tower pressure to maximize the benefits of enhanced relative volatil-
ity, and reduced tray deck dumping without unduly promoting jet 
flooding due to entrainment?
To answer this fundamental question, we should realize that 
reducing the tower pressure will also reduce both the tower-top tem-
perature and the tower-bottom temperature. So the change in these 
temperatures, by themselves, is not particularly informative. But if 
we look at the difference between the bottom and top temperatures, 
this difference is an excellent indication of fractionation efficiency. 
The bigger this temperature difference, the better the split. For 
instance, if the tower-top and tower-bottom temperatures are the 
same for a 25-tray tower, what is the average tray efficiency? (Answer: 
100 percent ÷ 25 = 4 percent.)
The basis for the 100 percent is that if the tower top and bottom 
temperatures are identical (plus or minus a few degrees), then the 
entire tower is functioning as if it represented a single perfect theoreti-
cal fractionation stage. The fractionation efficiency of a theoretical stage 
is equal to one perfect tray operating at 100-percent efficiency.
Figure 6.5 illustrates this relationship. Point A is the incipient 
flood point. In this case, the incipient flood point is defined as the 

	
72	
C h a p t e r  S i x
operating pressure that maximizes the temperature difference across 
the tower at a particular reflux rate. How, then, do we select the opti-
mum tower pressure to obtain the best efficiency point for the trays? 
(Answer: Look at the temperature profile across the column.)
6.4  The Phase Rule in Distillation
This is perhaps an idea you remember from high school, but never 
quite understood. The phase rule corresponds to determining how 
many independent variables we can fix in a process before all the 
other variables become dependent variables. In a reflux drum, we can 
fix the temperature and composition of the liquid in the drum. The 
temperature and composition are called independent variables. The 
pressure in the drum could now be calculated from the chart in 
Fig. 6.4. The pressure is a dependent variable. The phase rule for the 
reflux drum system states that we can select any two variables arbi-
trarily (temperature, pressure, or composition), but then the remain-
ing variable is fixed.
A simple distillation tower, like that shown in Fig. 6.2, also must 
obey its own phase rule. Here, because the distillation tower is a more 
complex system than the reflux drum, there are three independent 
variables that must be specified. The operator can choose from a large 
number of variables, but must select no more than three from the fol-
lowing list:
• Tower pressure
• Reflux rate, or reflux ratio
• Reboiler duty
• Tower-top temperature
• Tower-bottom temperature
• Overhead product rate
Bot. temp. minus top temp.

• Bottoms product rate
• Overhead product composition
• Bottoms product composition
The prior discussion assumes that the feed rate, feed composi-
tion, and heat content of the feed (enthalpy) are fixed. My purpose in 
presenting this review of the phase rule is to encourage the routine 
manipulation of tower-operating pressures in the same sense, and 
with the same objectives, as adjusting reflux rates. Operators who 
arbitrarily run a column at a fixed tower pressure are discarding one-
third of the flexibility available to them to operate the column in the 
most efficient fashion. And this is true regardless of whether the objec-
tive is to save energy or improve the product split.

CHAPTER 7
What Drives 
Distillation Towers
Reboiler Function
A
n internal-combustion engine drives a car. Pumps are driven 
by turbines or motors. Jet planes are pushed by the thrust of 
an axial air compressor.
7.1  The Reboiler
All machines have drivers. A distillation column is also a machine, 
driven by a reboiler. It is the heat duty of the reboiler, supplemented 
by the heat content (enthalpy) of the feed, that provides the energy to 
make a split between light and heavy components. A useful example 
of the importance of the reboiler in distillation comes from the vener-
able use of sugarcane in my home state of Louisiana.
If the cut cane is left in the fields for a few months, its sugar con-
tent ferments to alcohol. Squeezing the cane then produces a rather 
low-proof alcoholic drink. Of course, one would naturally wish to 
concentrate the alcohol content by distillation, in the still shown in 
Fig. 7.1.
The alcohol is called the light component, because it boils at a lower 
temperature than water; the water is called the heavy component, 
because it boils at a higher temperature than alcohol. Raising the top 
reflux rate will lower the tower-top temperature and reduce the 
amount of the heavier component, water, in the overhead alcohol 
product. But what happens to the weight of vapor flowing up through 
the trays? Does the flow go up, go down, or remain the same?
There are two ways to answer this question. Let’s first look at the 
reboiler. As the tower-top temperature shown in Fig. 7.1 goes down, 
more of the lighter, lower-boiling-point alcohol is refluxed down the 
tower. The tower-bottom temperature begins to drop, and the steam 
flow to the reboiler is automatically increased by the action of the 
75

	
76	
C h a p t e r  S e v e n
temperature recorder controller (TRC). As the steam flow to the 
reboiler increases, so does the reboiler duty (or energy injected into 
the tower in the form of heat). Almost all the reboiler heat or duty is 
converted to vaporization. We will prove this statement mathemati-
cally later in this chapter. The increased vapor leaving the reboiler 
then bubbles up through the trays, and hence the flow of vapor is 
seen to increase as the reflux rate is raised.
Now let’s look at the reflux drum. The incremental reflux flow 
comes from this drum. But the liquid in this drum comes from the con-
denser. The feed to the condenser is vapor from the top of the tower. 
Hence, as we increase the reflux flow, the vapor rate from the top of the 
tower must increase. One way of summarizing these results is to say 
that the reflux comes from the reboiler.
The statement that the mass, or weight flow of vapor through the 
trays, increases as the reflux rate is raised is based on the reboiler 
being on automatic temperature control. If the reboiler were on man-
ual control, then the flow of steam and the reboiler heat duty would 
remain constant as the reflux rate was increased, and the weight flow 
of vapor up the tower would remain constant as the top reflux rate 
was increased. But the liquid level in the reflux drum would begin to 
drop. The reflux drum level recorder controller (LRC) would close off

to catch the falling level, and the overhead product rate would drop 
in proportion to the increase in reflux rate. We can now draw some 
conclusions from the foregoing discussion:
• The flow of vapor leaving the top tray of the tower is equal to 
the flow of reflux, plus the flow of the alcohol overhead product.
• The overhead condenser heat-removal duty is proportional 
to the reboiler heat duty.
• The weight flow of vapor in a tower is controlled by one factor 
and one factor only: heat.
An increase in reflux rate, assuming that the reboiler is on auto-
matic temperature control, increases both the tray weir loading and 
the vapor velocity through the tray deck. This increases both the total 
tray pressure drop and the height of liquid in the tray’s downcomer. 
Increasing reflux rates, with the reboiler on automatic temperature 
control, will always push the tray closer to or even beyond the point 
of incipient flood.
7.2  Heat-Balance Calculations
If you have read this far and understood what you have read, you 
will readily understand the following calculation. It is simply a 
repetition, with numbers, of the discussion previously presented. 
However, you will require the following values to perform the 
calculations:
• Latent heat of condensation of alcohol vapors = 400 Btu/lb
• Latent heat of condensation of water vapors = 1000 Btu/lb
• Specific heat of alcohol (vapor or liquid) = 0.6 Btu/[(lb)(°F)]
• Specific heat of water = 1.0 Btu/[(lb)(°F)]
The term specific heat refers to the sensible-heat content of either 
vapor or liquid. The specific heat is the amount of heat needed to raise 
the temperature on one pound of the vapor or liquid by 1°F. The term 
latent heat refers to the heat of vaporization, or the heat of condensation, 
needed to vaporize or condense one pound of liquid or vapor at constant 
temperature. Note that the heat of condensation is equal to the heat of 
vaporization. Each is referred to as the latent heat. The sum of the sensible 
heat, plus the latent heat, is called the total heat content, or enthalpy.
Returning to our example in Fig. 7.1, we wish first to deter­
mine the reboiler duty. To do this, we have to supply three heat 
requirements:
	 A.	 Heat 9000 lb/h of water from the 100°F feed temperature to 
the tower-bottom temperature of 220°F.

	
78	
C h a p t e r  S e v e n
	
B.	 Heat 1000 lb/h of alcohol from the 100°F feed temperature 
(where the alcohol is a liquid) to the tower overhead tempera-
ture of 160°F (where the alcohol is a vapor).
	 C.	 Vaporize 10,000 lb/h of reflux from the 150°F reflux drum 
temperature to the tower overhead temperature of 160°F.
Solution to step A:
9000 lb/h × 1.0 Btu/[(lb)(°F)] × (220°F - 100°F) = 1,080,000 Btu/h
Solution to step B:
1000 lb/h × 0.6 Btu/[(lb)(°F)] × (160°F - 100°F) + 1000 lb/h
    × 400 Btu/lb = 36,000 Btu/h + 400,000 Btu/h = 436,000 Btu/h
Solution to step C:
10,000 lb/h × 0.6 Btu/[(lb)(°F)] × (160°F - 150°F) + 10,000 lb/h
	
  × 400 Btu/lb
	
= 60,000 Btu/h + 4,000,000 Btu/h = 4,060,000 Btu/h
The reboiler duty is then the sum of A + B + C = 5,576,000 Btu/h.
The next part of the problem is to determine the vapor flow to the 
bottom tray. If we assume that the vapor leaving the reboiler is essen-
tially steam, then the latent heat of condensation of this vapor is 1000 
Btu/lb. Hence the flow of vapor (all steam) to the bottom tray is
= 5,576,000 Btu/h ÷ 1000 Btu/lb = 5576 lb/h
What about the vapor flow leaving the top tray of our splitter? 
That is simply the sum of the reflux plus the overhead product:
10,000 lb/h + 1000 lb/h = 11,000 lb/h
How about the condenser duty? That is calculated as follows:
	
11,000 lb/h × 0.6 Btu/[(lb)(°F)] × (160°F - 150°F)
	
      + 11,000 lb/h × 400 BTU/lb 
	
    = 66,000 BTU/h + 4,400,000 BTU/h = 4,466,000 BTU/h
We can draw the following conclusions from this example:
• The condenser duty is usually a little smaller than the reboiler 
duty.
• Most of the reboiler heat duty usually goes into generating 
reflux.
• The flow of vapor up the tower is created by the reboiler.
For other applications, these statements may be less appropriate. 
This is especially so when the reflux rate is much smaller than the 

	
W h a t  D r i v e s  D i s t i l l a t i o n  To w e r s 	
79
feed rate. But if you can grasp these calculations, then you can appre-
ciate the concept of the reboiler acting as the engine to drive the distil-
lation column.
7.2.1  Effect of Feed Preheat
Up to this point, we have suggested that the weight flow of vapor up the 
tower is a function of the reboiler duty only. Certainly, this cannot be 
completely true. If we look at Fig. 7.2, it certainly seems that increasing 
the heat duty on the feed preheater will reduce the reboiler duty.
Let us assume that both the reflux rate and the overhead propane 
product rate are constant. This means that the total heat flow into the 
tower is constant. Or the sum of the reboiler duty plus the feed pre-
heater duty is constant. If the steam flow to the feed preheater is 
increased, then it follows that the reboiler duty will fall. How does 
this increase in feed preheat affect the flow of vapor through the trays 
and the fractionation efficiency of the trays?
The bottom part of the tower in Fig. 7.2—that is, the portion 
below the feed inlet—is called the stripping section. The upper part of

the tower—that is, the portion above the feed inlet—is called the 
absorption section.
Since both the reflux flow and the overhead product flow are 
constant in this problem, it follows that the weight flow of vapor 
leaving the top tray is also constant, regardless of the feed pre-
heater duty. Actually, this statement is approximately true for all 
the trays in the top or absorption part of the tower. Another way of 
saying this is that the heat input to the tower above the feed tray is 
a constant.
But for the bottom stripping section trays, a reduction in reboiler 
duty will directly reduce the vapor flow from the reboiler to the bot-
tom tray. This statement is approximately valid for all the trays in the 
stripping section of the tower.
As the flow of vapor through the absorption section trays is 
unaffected by feed preheat, the fractionation efficiency of the trays 
in the upper part of the tower will not change as feed preheat  
is increased. On the other hand, the reduced vapor flow through the 
stripping section may increase or decrease fractionation efficiency—
but why?
7.2.2  Optimizing Feed Preheater Duty
Trays suffer from lost tray efficiency as a result of both flooding and 
dumping. Trays have some entrained droplets of liquid lifted by the 
flowing vapors to the trays above. This tends to blow butane up into 
the lighter propane product. Perforated trays always have some leak-
age of liquid through the tray deck to the trays below. This tends to 
drip propane down into the heavier butane product.
When we increase feed preheat and the reboiler duty is automati­
cally reduced, dumping increases, but entrainment decreases. If the 
trays below the feed point were working poorly because they were 
flooding, increasing feed preheat would improve their fractionation 
efficiency. If the trays below the feed point were working poorly 
because they were dumping, increasing feed preheat would reduce 
their fractionation efficiency. Figure 7.3 summarizes this effect. If, for 
this tower, we arbitrarily state that the percent of butane in the over-
head propane product is constant, then the feed preheat duty, which 
minimizes the propane content in the butane bottoms product, repre-
sents the optimum preheater duty. This preheater duty corresponds to 
the incipient flood point. The optimum feed preheater duty maximizes 
fractionation at a fixed reflux rate.
Varying the heat content of the feed is an additional independent 
variable that an operator can use to optimize fractionation efficiency. 
An additional benefit of feed preheat is that a lower-level tempera-
ture heat source can be used. If valuable 100-psig steam is required 
for the reboiler, then low-value 20-psig steam might be adequate for 
the feed preheat exchanger.

7.2.3  Multicomponent Systems
So far, all our examples have dealt with two-component systems, and 
many of our towers really just have two components. Also, we have 
assumed that the reflux rate is large compared to the overhead product 
rate, and many of our towers do run with a lot of reflux. But we can all 
think of distillation columns where the top reflux rate is small compared 
to the overhead product, and the overhead product itself consists of  
a dozen widely different chemical com­pounds. Figure 7.4 represents 
such a column. It is called a crude preflash tower.

Notice that there is no reboiler in this flash tower. All the heat 
input comes from the partially vaporized crude. Both the tempera-
ture and the percent vaporization of the crude are fixed. Hence, the 
external heat input to the preflash tower is constant. The pounds of 
vapor flowing to the bottom tray must also be constant.
Now the overhead product of this tower is a mixture of a hun-
dred different components, ranging from ethane, which has a molec-
ular weight of 30, to decane, which has a molecular weight of 142. 
Also, while the overhead vapor rate is 60,000 lb/h, the top reflux rate 
is only 10,000 lb/h.
Consider the following. When the operator raises the top reflux 
rate, what happens to the weight flow of vapor going to the top tray? 
Recalling that the external heat input to this tower is constant, do the 
pounds per hour of vapor flowing to the top tray increase, remain the 
same, or decrease? The correct answer is increase. But why?
7.2.4  Conversion of Sensible Heat to Latent Heat
When we raise the top reflux rate to our preflash tower, the tower-top 
temperature goes down. This is a sign that we are washing out from 
the up-flowing vapors more of the heavier or higher-molecular-weight 
components in the overhead product. Of course, that is why we raised 
the reflux rate. So the reduction in tower-top temperature is good.
But what happened to the sensible-heat content (the heat repre-
sented by the temperature) of the vapors leaving the tower? As the 
vapor is cooler, the sensible-heat content decreased. Where did this 
heat go?
A small part of the heat was picked up by the extra liquid drain-
ing from the top tray. This extra liquid comes from the extra reflux. 
But the liquid flow through the tower is too small to carry away much 
heat. The main reason why the vapors leaving the top tray are cooler 
is vaporization; in other words, the sensible-heat content of the flow-
ing vapors is converted to latent heat of vaporization.
But what is vaporizing? The reflux, of course. The sensible-heat 
content of the vapors, which is reduced when the reflux rate is 
increased, is converted to latent heat as the vapors partially vaporize 
the incremental reflux flow.
As the reflux rate is raised, the weight flow of vapor through the 
top tray, and to a lesser extent through all the trays below (except 
for the bottom tray), increases. This increase in the weight flow of 
vapor occurs even though the external heat input to the preflash 
tower is constant. The weight flow of vapor to the bottom tray is 
presumed to be solely a function of the pounds of vapor in the feed.
7.2.5  Reduced Molecular Weight
A reduction in tower-top temperature of 20°F would increase the 
weight flow of vapor by roughly 10 percent. But the composition of 

	
W h a t  D r i v e s  D i s t i l l a t i o n  To w e r s 	
83
the vapor would also change. The molecular weight of the vapor 
would drop by approximately 8 percent. The lower the molecular 
weight (MW) of a gas, the greater the volume that a given weight of 
the gas occupies.
	
Gas volume
weight of gas
MW of gas
≈
	
In this equation, if the weight of gas goes up by 10 percent, and the 
molecular weight of the gas goes down by 8 percent, then the volume 
of gas goes up by 18 percent. The reduction in the tower-top tempera-
ture of 20°F does shrink the gas by about 3 percent, as a result of the 
temperature reduction, so that the net effect of raising the reflux rate 
is to increase the gas volume through the top tray by 15 percent (i.e., 
18 percent minus 3 percent). This results in a substantial increase in 
the top tray pressure drop, which can, and often does, cause the top 
tray to flood. This can happen even though the external heat input 
and feed rate to the tower have never changed.
7.2.6  Internal Reflux Evaporation
The tray temperatures in our preflash tower, shown in Fig. 7.4, drop as 
the gas flows up the tower. Most of the reduced sensible-heat content 
of the flowing gas is converted to latent heat of evaporation of the 
downflowing reflux. This means that the liquid flow, or internal reflux 
rate, decreases as the liquid flows down the column. The greater the 
temperature drop per tray, the greater the evaporation of internal 
reflux. It is not unusual for 80 to 90 percent of the reflux to evaporate 
between the top and bottom trays in the absorption section of many 
towers. We say that the lower trays in the absorption section of such a 
tower are “drying out.” The separation efficiency of trays operating 
with extremely low liquid flows over their weirs will be very low. This 
problem is commonly encountered for towers with low reflux ratios 
and a multicomponent overhead product composition.
7.2.7  Overview
I once claimed that I could teach any interested, reasonably intelli­
gent person the elements of chemical engineering in two hours. The 
part of this chapter about the heat balance calculations represents my 
effort to defend this claim. If you are not a chemical engineer and you 
have understood the preceding calculations, then you may know 
enough to pass as a degreed chemical engineer. Well, maybe I’m 
exaggerating. Maybe you had better read the rest of this book first.

CHAPTER 8
How Reboilers Work
Thermosyphon, Gravity 
Feed, and Forced
Four types of reboilers are discussed in this chapter:
• Once-through thermosyphon reboilers
• Circulating thermosyphon reboilers
• Forced-circulation reboilers
• Kettle or gravity-fed reboilers
There are dozens of other types of reboilers, but these four repre-
sent the majority of applications. Regardless of the type of reboiler 
used, the following statement is correct: Almost as many towers flood 
because of reboiler problems as because of tray problems.
The theory of thermosyphon, or natural circulation, can be illus-
trated by the airlift pump shown in Fig. 8.1. This system is being used to 
recover gold-bearing gravel from the Magdalena River in Colombia, 
South America. Compressed air is forced to the bottom of the river 
through the air line. The air is injected into the bottom of the riser tube. 
The aerated water in the riser tube is less dense than the water in the 
river. This creates a pressure imbalance between points A and B. Since 
the pressure at point B is less than that at point A, water (as well as 
the gold and gravel) is sucked off the bottom of the river and up into the 
riser tube. We can calculate the pressure difference between points A and 
B as follows:
= ∆P
(HRW)(DRW) – (HRT)(DRT)
2.31
where HRW = height of water above the bottom of the riser, ft
 
DRW = specific gravity of fluid in the riser; in this case 1.0
 
HRT = height of the aerated water in the riser tube, ft
85

	
86	
C h a p t e r  E i g h t
 
DRT = specific gravity of aerated water in the riser tube 
(this number can be obtained only by a trial-and-
error calculation procedure)
	
DP = differential pressure between points A and B, psi
In a thermosyphon or natural-circulation reboiler, there is, of course, 
no source of air. The aerated liquid is a froth or foam produced by the 
vaporization of the reboiler feed. Without a source of heat, there can be 
no vaporization. And without vaporization, there will be no circula-
tion. So we can say that the source of energy that drives the circulation 
in a thermosyphon reboiler is the heating medium to the reboiler.
8.1  Thermosyphon Reboilers
8.1.1  Once-Through Thermosyphon Reboilers
Figure 8.2 shows a once-through thermosyphon reboiler. The driving 
force to promote flow through this reboiler is the density difference 
between the reboiler feed line and the froth-filled reboiler return line. 
For example:
• The specific gravity of the liquid in the reboiler feed line is 
0.600.
• The height of liquid above the reboiler inlet is 20 ft.
• The mixed-phase specific gravity of the froth leaving the 
reboiler is 0.061.

What happens to this differential pressure of 4.7 psi? It is con-

• Inlet line
• Outlet line
• Nozzles
If these frictional losses are less than the 4.7 psi I have calculated 
above, then the inlet line does not run liquid full. If the frictional losses 
are more than the 4.7 psi, the reboiler draw-off pan overflows, and 
flow to the reboiler is reduced until such time as the frictional losses 
drop to the available thermosyphon driving force.

C h a p t e r  E i g h t
The once-through thermosyphon reboiler, shown in Fig. 8.2, 
operates as follows:
• All the liquid from the bottom tray flows to the reboiler.
• None of the liquid from the bottom of the tower flows to the 
reboiler.
• All the bottoms product comes from the liquid portion of the 
reboiler effluent.
• None of the liquid from the bottom tray flows to the bottom 
of the tower.
This means that when the once-through thermosyphon reboiler is 
working correctly, the reboiler outlet temperature and the tower-
bottom temperature are identical. If the tower-bottom temperature is 
cooler than the reboiler outlet temperature, something has gone 
wrong with the thermosyphon circulation.
8.1.1.1  Loss of Once-Through Thermosyphon Circulation
There are several common causes of loss of circulation. The common 
symptoms of this problem are
• Inability to achieve normal reboiler duty
• Low reflux drum level, accompanied by low tower pressure, 
even at a low reflux rate
• Bottoms product too light
• Reboiler outlet temperature hotter than the tower-bottom 
temperature
• Opening the steam or hot-oil inlet heat supply valve does not 
seem to get more heat into the tower
The typical causes of this problem are
• Bottom tray in tower leaking due to a low dry tray pressure 
drop
• Bottom tray, seal pan, or draw-off pan is damaged
• Reboiler is partially plugged
• Reboiler feed line is restricted
• Reboiler design pressure drop is excessive
• Tower-bottom liquid level is covering the reboiler vapor 
return nozzle
If the loss of circulation is due to damage or leakage inside the 
tower, one can restore flow by opening the start-up line (valve A 
shown in Fig. 8.2), and raising the liquid level. But if the reboiler is 
fouled, this will not help.

	
H o w  R e b o i l e r s  W o r k

Figure 8.3 shows a once-through thermosyphon reboiler with a 
vertical baffle. This looks quite a bit different from Fig. 8.2, but process-
wise, it is the same. Note that the reboiler return liquid flows only to 
the hot side of the tower bottoms. Putting the reboiler return liquid to 
the colder side of the tower bottoms represents poor design practice. 
While most designers do it this way, it is still wrong.
8.1.2  Circulating Thermosyphon Reboilers
My last statement requires some clarification. But to understand my 
explanation, an understanding of the important differences between a 
once-through thermosyphon reboiler and a circulating thermosyphon 
reboiler is critical. Figure 8.4 shows a circulating reboiler. In this reboiler
• The reboiler outlet temperature is always higher than the 
tower-bottom temperature.
• Some of the liquid from the reboiler outlet will always recir-
culate back into the reboiler feed.
• Some of the liquid from the bottom tray drops into the bot-
toms product.
• The tower-bottom product temperature and composition are 
the same as the temperature and composition of the feed 
to the reboiler.

C h a p t e r  E i g h t
The liquid feed rate to the once-through thermosyphon reboiler is 
limited to the amount of liquid overflowing the bottom tray. The liquid 
feed rate to the circulating thermosyphon reboiler can be quite high—
limited only by the available liquid head thermosyphon driving force. 
However, we should note that the liquid head thermosyphon driving 
force for a circulating thermosyphon reboiler is proportional to the 
height of the liquid level in the bottom of the tower above the reboiler 
inlet nozzle, whereas with a once-through thermosyphon reboiler, as 
described previously, the corresponding height is the elevation of the 
floor of the draw-off pan sump above the reboiler inlet nozzle.
For a circulating thermosyphon reboiler, the rate of circulation 
can be increased by
• Increasing the steam or hot-oil flow through the reboiler. This 
reduces the specific gravity or density of the froth or foam in 
the reboiler effluent line.
• Increasing the tower bottoms liquid level. However, should this 
level reach the reboiler return nozzle, thermosyphon flow will 
be restricted or even stop. Then the reboiler heat duty will be 
reduced, and the tower pressure will drop. Sometimes this may 
cause the tower to flood.
8.1.3  Circulating Versus Once-Through Thermosyphon Reboilers
We said before that it was wrong to return the effluent from a 
once-through reboiler with a vertical baffle to the cold side of the 
Steam

tower’s bottom. Doing so would actually make the once-through 
thermosyphon reboiler work more like a circulating reboiler. But if 
this is bad, then the once-through reboiler must be better than the 
circulating reboiler. But why?
• The once-through reboiler functions as the bottom theoretical 
separation stage of the tower. The circulating reboiler does 
not, because a portion of its effluentback mixes to its feed 
inlet. This backmixing ruins the separation that can otherwise 
be achieved in reboilers.
• Regardless of the type of reboiler used, the tower-bottom 
product temperature has to be the same, so as to meet product 
specifications. This is shown in Fig. 8.5. However, the reboiler 
outlet temperature must always be higher in the circulating 
reboiler than in the once-through reboiler. This means that it is 
more difficult to transfer heat in the former than in the latter.
• Because the liquid from the bottom tray of a tower with a circu-
lating thermosyphon reboiler is of a composition similar to that 
of the bottoms product, we can say that the circulating thermo-
syphon reboiler does not act as a theoretical separation stage. 
However, the liquid from the bottom tray of a tower with a 
once-through thermosyphon reboiler can be quite a bit lighter in 
composition (and hence cooler) than the bottoms product compo-
sition, and thus we say that the once-through thermosyphon 
reboiler does act as a theoretical separation stage. The cooler the 
liquid flow from the bottom tray of a tower, the less the vapor

flow through that tray. This is because the hot vapor flowing up 
through a tray heats up the downflowing liquid. This means 
that there is a greater vapor flow through the bottom tray of a 
tower with a circulating thermosyphon reboiler than there 
would be through the bottom tray of a tower with a once-
through thermosyphon reboiler. Everything else being equal, 
then, the tower served by the circulating reboiler is going to 
flood before the tower served by the once-through reboiler.
8.1.4  The Super-Fractionation Stage
A once-through thermosyphon reboiler not only functions as the bot-
tom theoretical stage of a tower, it also functions as if it is a super-
fractionation stage. This means that it is more important than any 
individual tray in the tower. This is especially true with a multi-
component tower bottoms product.
I’ve devoted a whole chapter to this concept of the super- 
fractionation (Chap. 49) stage in this book. The concept of once-
through versus circulating reboilers and the super-fractionation stage 
is personally important to me. My perspective of any engineering 
problem is always the same: How does this problem look to the oper-
ator in the field? This is my perspective regardless of whether I am 
designing new equipment or troubleshooting existing equipment. To 
the operator, the malfunction of a once-through thermosyphon 
reboiler appears to be a major malfunction. That is why I’ve devoted 
so much space to this subject.
8.1.5  Excessive Thermosyphon Circulation
In a once-through reboiler, the liquid flow coming out of the reboiler 
is limited to the bottoms product. In a circulating reboiler, the liquid 
flow coming out of the reboiler can be extremely high. If the reboiler 
return nozzle is located too close to the bottom tray of the tower, the 
greater volume of liquid leaving the nozzle can splash against the 
bottom tray. This alone can cause the entire column to flood. The best 
way to stop this flooding is to lower the tower bottom level.
Sometimes higher rates of thermosyphon circulation are good. 
They help prevent fouling and plugging of the reboiler due to low 
velocity and dirt in the bottoms product and especially high vapor-
ization rates. If the percentage of vaporization in a once-through 
reboiler is above 60 percent and dirt in the bottoms product is 
expected, then a circulating reboiler would be the better choice.
8.2  Forced-Circulation Reboilers
Figure 8.6 shows a once-through forced-circulation reboiler. Such a 
reboiler differs from a thermosyphon reboiler in that it has a pump to 
force circulation, rather than relying on natural or thermosyphon cir-
culation. This extra pump seems rather wasteful—and it is.

	
H o w  R e b o i l e r s  W o r k 	
93
The great advantage of forced circulation is that careful calcula-
tion of the pressure drop through the reboiler and associated piping 
is not critical. But as we can see in Fig. 8.6, the operator now has two 
tower-bottom levels to control. Further, if the hot-side liquid level 
rises above the reboiler return nozzle, the force of the vapor and liq-
uid rushing back into the column will cause the trays to flood, but the 
reboiler heat input will not be affected.
Most often, forced circulation is used with fired reboilers. If flow 
is lost to such a reboiler, furnace tube damage is likely to result. Hope-
fully, this is less likely to occur with a forced-circulation reboiler. Also, 
the higher pressure drop of a furnace may force the designer to use a 
pump. Sometimes we also see a forced-circulation reboiler system if 
the reboiler heat is to be recovered from a number of dispersed heat 
sources that are far away from the tower and hence a lot of pressure 
drop has to be overcome.
8.3  Kettle Reboilers
Reboilers are sometimes inserted into the bottom of a tower. These 
are called “stab-in” reboilers. It is not a terribly good idea, because

C h a p t e r  E i g h t
it makes it more difficult to fix a leaking or to clean a fouled reboiler 
without opening the tower itself. However, the “kettle” reboiler, 
shown in Fig. 8.7, has essen­ti­ally the same process performance 
characteristics as the stab-in reboiler, but is entirely external to the 
tower.
Note that in a kettle reboiler the bottoms product level control 
valve does not control the level in the tower; it controls the level on 
the product side of the reboiler only. The liquid level on the boiling or 
heat-exchanger side of the kettle is controlled by the internal over-
flow baffle. But what controls the tower-bottom liquid level?
To answer this, let us see how such a gravity-fed or kettle reboiler 
works:
 
1. Liquid flows out of the tower into the bottom of the reboiler’s 
shell.
 
2. The liquid is partially vaporized.
 
3. The domed top section of the reboiler separates the vapor 
and the liquid.

4. The vapor flows back to the tower through the riser line. This 
is the column’s stripping vapor or heat source.
 
5. The liquid overflows the baffle. The baffle is set high enough 
to keep the tubes submerged. This liquid is the bottoms 
product.
The liquid level in the bottom of the tower is the sum of the fol-
lowing factors:
• The nozzle exit loss of the liquid leaving the bottom of the 
tower
• The liquid feed-line pressure drop
• The shell-side exchanger pressure drop, which includes the 
effect of the baffle height
• The vapor-line riser pressure drop, including the vapor outlet 
nozzle loss
Note that it is the elevation, or the static head pressure, in the 
tower that drives the kettle reboiler. That is why we call it a gravity-
fed reboiler. Also, the pressure in the kettle will always be higher than 
the pressure in the tower. This means that an increase in the reboiler 
heat duty results in an increase of liquid level in the bottom of the 
tower.
Should the liquid level in the bottom of the tower rise to the 
reboiler vapor return nozzle, the tower will certainly flood, but 
the reboiler heat duty will continue. Unfortunately, reboiler shell-
side fouling may also lead to tray flooding. This happens because the 
fouling can cause a pressure-drop buildup on the shell side of the 
reboiler.
Remember, though, that the increased tower-bottom liquid level 
will not be reflected on the indicated bottom level seen in the control 
room, which is actually the level at the end of the kettle reboiler. This 
is a constant source of confusion to many operators who have towers 
that flood as a result of high liquid levels, yet their indicated liquid 
level remains normal. 
8.4  Don’t Forget Fouling
I have seen towers equipped with kettle reboilers flood due to high 
liquid levels a dozen times in my career. The story is always the same. 
The elevation difference between the reboiler vapor return nozzle 
and the overflow baffle inside the kettle is only 2 or 3 ft. The designer 
has forgotten about shell-side fouling.
A reasonable allowance for shell-side fouling could be an extra 
1 psi of DP. If we are dealing with a reboiler feed with a specific gravity 

	
96	
C h a p t e r  E i g h t
of 0.65 s.g., then the required height of the liquid inside the tower 
would increase by about 3.5 ft. This would increase the height of the 
reboiler return nozzle also by 3.5 ft.
In one debutanizer, I had to revamp a new tower by removing the 
bottom two trays and elevating the reboiler return nozzle by 5 ft. The 
designer had made no allowance for shell-side fouling. The shut-
down of the new debutanizer tower was the price my client paid for 
the designer’s error.
8.5  Vapor Binding in Steam Reboilers
The accumulation of non-condensables on the tube side of horizontal 
steam reboilers has an extremely detrimental effect on heat transfer.  
I have observed reboiler duty drop by well over one-half. The origins 
of the non-condensable vapors are:
• Contamination of the steam supply with CO2, N2, or light 
hydrocarbons
• Reboiler tube leaks
• Air trapped inside the channel head on start-up
There are a number of theories as to how these non-condensables 
reduce the reboiler duty to such a great extent:
• Tubes fill with gas and prevent the flow of steam into those 
tubes
• The non-condensables produce a film of gas around the tubes
• The non-condensables reduce the steam partial pressure and 
thus reduce the condensation temperature of the steam
Most of my experience with this subject is a loss in reboiler duty 
(over one day) due to a tube leak, or the more gradual loss of reboiler 
duty (over one month) due to CO2 accumulation in the channel head. 
Regardless, to alleviate the loss of reboiler duty, vent the channel 
head just below the bottom channel head pass partition baffle.

ray efficiency is important for meeting product specifications. 
Even if all products are on spec, we should still be con-
cerned about maximizing tray fractionation efficiency so as to 
minimize reflux rates. The more efficient the trays, the less reflux we 
require to produce an acceptable degree of fractionation. Since the 
reflux originates in the reboiler, reducing reflux also reduces reboiler 
energy requirements. As energy is our biggest operating cost, tray 
efficiency is a major component in minimizing operating costs. 
The fractionation tray efficiency is largely a function of the vapor-
liquid mixing efficiency. The more intimate the contact between the 
rising vapor and the descending liquid, the better the tray efficiency. 
The better the tray efficiency, the less fuel we need to run the process.
As I discussed in the previous chapters, tray contacting efficiency 
is mainly a function of two factors:
• Tray deck levelness
• Weir levelness
9.1  Tray Deck Levelness
For smaller diameter towers a visual check of tray deck levelness is 
sufficient. For two-pass trays, a small-diameter tower is less than 8 ft. 
For single-pass trays, a diameter of less than 6 ft is small.
For towers of 10 ft or more in diameter, check for out-of-levelness 
of a tray check using a carpenter’s laser level, available in hardware 
stores for about $40. Purchase a level that has short tripod legs. Use 
the bubble to level up the legs. Set the level on one end of the tower, 
and check the height of the red beam at the other end and at the cen-
ter of the tray for out-of-levelness. As it is often dim and dusty in the 
tower, the trace of the red laser may be clearly visible. Low points 
and areas of the tray deck that are out of level can now be easily 
identified. 
97

	
98	
C h a p t e r  N i n e
The more level the tray, the better the mixing efficiency between 
vapor and the liquid. Certainly, if the tray out-of-levelness is greater 
than the height of the weir, tray efficiency will be badly degraded.
Checking for weir out-of-levelness is easy. Set the laser level on the 
edge of the weir. Using the bubble glass level indicator, adjust the laser 
level to a true horizontal position. The line of red light compared to 
the top of the weir will indicate how much of the weir is out of level. 
A weir that is more than 0.5 inch out of level should be re-adjusted. If 
it is not, stagnant liquid pools behind the higher section of the weir, as 
described in the prior chapter, will result and ruin the tray‘s efficiency.
9.2  Loss of Downcomer Seal Due to Leaks
The vertical edges to the downcomers are bolted to bars welded to 
the vessel wall. These are called “downcomer bolting bars.” Gaskets 
are often used to tightly seal the edge of the tray downcomer to these 
bars. If the bolts are loose or if the gaskets are missing, vapor will 
blow into the downcomer and displace the descending liquid. Down-
comer backup and flooding may result.
The area underneath the downcomer is called the downpour area. 
If a tray deck corrodes, it often first holes through in the downpour 
area. This will cause flooding due to downcomer back-up. 
The bottom edge of the downcomer will be somewhat flexible in 
larger diameter towers. If the width of the tower is less than 5 ft, then 
the downcomer bolting bars prevent flexing of the bottom edge of the 
downcomer. However, if the width of the downcomer is over 5 or 6 ft, 
then downcomer bracing brackets (see Fig. 9.1) are required. The bot-
tom edge of the downcomer should be immobilized by attachment to 
the bolting bar or bracing bracket every 4 to 5 ft of downcomer width.
Recall that the pressure outside the downcomer is slightly greater 
than the pressure inside the downcomer. Therefore, a force will push 
the downcomer toward the vessel wall and reduce the open area of

the downcomer. This restriction promotes downcomer backup and 
flooding. Don’t expect to see this deformation of the downcomer dur-
ing your inspection. Once the vapor flow through the tray stops, the 
downcomer will spring back to its design position.
9.3  Effect of Missing Caps 
I tend to ignore a few missing valve caps, unless many of the caps are 
missing in a localized area or the percent of missing caps exceeds 5 to 
10 percent. The caps serve very little function as the open area under-
neath the cap is about the same as the hole area covered by the cap. 
The flow of vapor passing through an orifice without its cap may be 
about 70 percent greater than the design. Compared to other tray 
problems, this is not too serious a problem.
9.4  Repairing Loose Tray Panels
Here’s a sad story that happened in Corpus Christi, Texas. I inspected 
the tower and found two problems:
• One or two tray panels were dislodged on each tray.
• The tray panels were encrusted with 0.5 inch of corrosion 
products.
The plant manager was in a terrible rush to bring the tower back  
on-line. He instructed the maintenance folks to bolt the trays back up, 
but skip the lengthy tray cleaning. When the tower was restreamed, the 
trays flooded at 60 percent of their preturnaround capacity. Fixing the 
tray panels forced all the vapor to flow through the valve caps. Unfortu-
nately, due to the corrosion deposits on the decks, the tray pressure drop 
was twice the design DP. This raised the liquid levels in the downcomers 
and thus the flooding. While identifying loose tray panels is fine, it’s best 
to be careful before changing something that’s already working.
9.5  Improper Downcomer Clearance
The bottom edge of the downcomer from the tray above should be 0.25 
to 0.5 inch below the top edge of the weir of the tray below. This is 
called a positive downcomer seal. Without a positive downcomer seal, 
vapor will flow up the downcomer and displace the downflowing 
liquid. This will cause flooding due to excessive downcomer backup.
On the other hand, if the bottom of the downcomer is too close to 
the tray below, then the “head loss under the downcomer” will be 
excessive. Typically, a minimum downcomer clearance is 1.5 to 2 inch. 
Too small a downcomer clearance will result in restricting the liquid 
flow from the downcomer. This will also cause excessive downcomer 
backup and flooding. Check the correct downcomer clearance on the 
vender tray drawings prior to the tower inspection.

9.6  Inlet Weirs
Most trays have outlet weirs devoted to maintaining the downcomer 
seal. But some trays have inlet weirs too, or inlet weirs, but no outlet 
weirs. A sketch of an inlet weir is shown in Fig. 9.2. Note the horizontal 
distance between the downcomer and the inlet weir (dimension x). 
This distance ought to be equal to or greater than the downcomer clear-
ance—that is, the vertical space between the tray floor and the bottom 
edge of the downcomer. Unfortunately, a small deformation of the 
downcomer may push the downcomer quite close to the inlet weir. The 
resulting reduction in the horizontal clearance between the inlet weir 
and the downcomer will restrict the liquid flow. This will cause down-
comer backup and tray flooding of the trays above.
Often, there is no process reason for the use of inlet weirs, espe-
cially at higher liquid rates. Then the inlet weirs may be removed. But 
some tray types, such as “Exxon Jet Tab” trays or total trap-out chim-
ney trays with no outlet weir, absolutely require the use of inlet weirs.
9.7  Seal Pans
The downcomer from the bottom tray is submerged in a seal pan (see 
Fig. 9.3) to preserve its downcomer seal. I always set the horizontal 
dimension between the over-flow lip of the seal pan (dimension y) and 
the downcomer at 4 inches, so I never have to worry about restricting 
liquid flow from the bottom tray. This horizontal dimension should 
be equal to or greater than the vertical clearance between the down-
comer and the seal pan floor (dimension x, which is typically 2 to  
3 inches). If a deformation of the downcomer reduces the horizontal 
clearance between the seal pan overflow lip and the downcomer,

the resulting restriction can cause the bottom tray to flood due to 
downcomer back-up. If the bottom tray floods, flooding will progress 
up the column. With time, the entire column will flood due to the 
small restriction in the seal pan. That’s why a detailed tray-by-tray 
inspection is important.
9.8  Drain Holes
All tray sections, draw-off sumps, recessed downcomer inlet sumps, 
seal pans, chimney trays, and other tower internals must be self-
draining. As a column is heated on start-up, water can expand to 
steam with explosive force. Especially for lower pressure and larger 
diameter towers, tray panels are frequently dislodged due to flashing 
of trapped water. My experience indicates that drain holes of less 
than 0.5 inch, drilled in the bottom of a pan are likely to plug off due 
to fouling. The better way to place a drain hole is in a vertical wall of 
a pan, flush with the pan floor, as indicated in Fig. 9.3.
Chimney draw-off trays are typically designed to slope toward 
the draw-off nozzle, thus avoiding a need for drain holes. However, 
with age, such trays warp because of thermal expansion and pools of 
water can be trapped. Inspection after water washing will reveal such 
poorly drained trays and pinpoint the location of required drain 
holes. But excessive use of drain holes can also be bad. Product losses 
through the drain holes can be estimated by the following:

H
V
=
where H = liquid level on tray, inches
	
V = hole velocity, feet per second
The volumetric rate of flow lost through the drain hole is then the 
hole area multiplied by the hole velocity. With this equation in hand, 
your inspection may find drain holes that are best closed.

C h a p t e r  N i n e
If a drain hole plugs on a bottom tray seal pan, I have found that 
the seal pan will, with time, fill with dirt and corrosion products. 
This restricts the flow from the downcomer and has caused at least 
one amine fuel gas hydrogen sulfide absorber to flood. To avoid this 
problem, I’ll size the drain holes in such seal pans to pass 20 percent 
of the liquid flow, or at least use a single 1-inch drain hole. Unless 
liquid is flushed out of the bottom of the bottom tray seal pan, the 
solids washed down the column settle out in the seal pan.
9.9  Vortex Breakers
I have a personal dislike of this widely used device. The idea of the 
vortex breaker is to prevent swirling liquid from conveying vapor 
into the draw-off nozzle. Sometimes though, trash lost in the tower 
during a turnaround gets caught on the vortex breaker. Since the 
draw nozzle typically is located in a sump below the seal pan, it 
may be hard to inspect. In some cases, it would be best to just cut off 
the vortex breaker. This is fine if the nozzle exit velocity is less than 
3 or 4 ft/s.
The seal pan itself is also hard to inspect, as it is usually hidden 
inside the draw-off sump. Corrosion deposits may accumulate in the 
seal pan and cause the trays above to flood. A small mirror is a good 
tool to observe these hard to reach locations: maintenance folks use 
this tool all the time.
9.10  Chimney Tray Leakage
I like to establish a water level on chimney trays up to the overflow 
pipe. Next, I crawl under the tray to look for trickles of water. When 
the tower heats up, such minor leaks are likely to get worse. Also, I 
check the alignment of the chimney hats to make sure they are actu-
ally centered over the chimneys. After the water is drained down, I 
look for puddles of water that indicate a need for drain holes. If there 
is an overflow pipe, I’ll check that the overflow pipe will be sub-
merged in its seal pan.
9.11  Shear Clips
If a tower has a history of tray deck damage due to pressure surge or 
high liquid level, the mechanical integrity of the trays should be 
upgraded. This is done by the use of shear clips, as shown in Fig. 9.4. 
The use of shear clips is not the best way to improve the mechanical 
integrity of trays but it is the only effective method to use during a 
turnaround, when no other plans have been made to mechanically 
upgrade the tray decks and time is short.

	
I n s p e c t i n g  To w e r  I n t e r n a l s 	
103
Underneath the tray, where the tray panels are bolted together, 
there is a narrow vertical strip of steel, which is called the integral 
truss. This truss is not connected to the tray ring. Referring to 
Fig. 9.4, a small steel bar (4 inch by 2 inch by 0.25 inch) is welded or 
bolted to the end of the integral truss. This bar is the shear clip, 
which is inserted underneath the tray ring. (Do not weld the shear 
clip to the tray ring.) When an upward surge of vapor pushes the 
tray up, the force is transmitted along the length of the integral 
truss, through the shear clip, to the tray ring, and thus to the vessel 
wall. Many large diameter towers will already have shear clips. But 
if your inspection indicates they are not present and tray failure has 
been a problem, the installation of shear clips is the way to go for 
three reasons:
• The job can usually be done in 24 hours, while other tower 
work continues.
• The shear clips can be cut from an ordinary 0.25-inch carbon 
steel plate.
• Experience proves they are effective in resisting moderate 
pressure surges. 
9.12  Bubble-Cap Trays
About 5 percent of the trayed towers have old style bubble-cap trays. 
Dirt and coke tends to accumulate under the cap. This cannot be seen 
unless the cap is removed. Coke underneath the bubble cap will 
restrict the vapor flow, increase vapor DP and promote downcomer

backup and flooding. It only takes a moment to unscrew a bubble cap 
using a crescent wrench. The maintenance folks will usually clean the 
deck, but not remove the caps. Liz injured herself crawling through a 
manway helping me discover this problem at the Motiva Refinery 
visbreaker fractionator in Convent, Louisiana. This tower flooded on 
start-up, because the small areas between the caps and the chimneys 
inside the caps were mostly coked off.
9.13  Final Inspection
At a Gulf Coast (Amoco, Texas City) refinery, the reboiler thermosy-
phon circulation could not be re-established after a turnaround. The 
tower was re-opened and a less-than-alive contract employee was 
found stuck in the reboiler draw-off nozzle. At the Good Hope 
Refinery (when I was the technical manager), we once left a com-
plete scaffold (poles, boards, everything) in the bottom of a debuta-
nizer tower. Rags, hard hats, plywood, and especially plastic bags 
left in packed columns should be removed from inside draw sumps 
and downcomers. I know it’s rough on the knees, but crawl across 
every tray and look into each downcomer. One lost flashlight in a 
small downcomer may flood every tray in the tower. A rag caught 
on a vortex breaker in a jet fuel draw box has caused a complete 
refinery shutdown.
Check the tray clips, tray panels, and downcomer bolting bars. At 
the least the nuts and bolts should be finger-tight. If you find a single 
loose nut, insist that every nut on that tray be retightened. I will check 
the tray clips and 10 percent of the downcomer bolting bar nuts for 
finger-tight.
9.13.1  Tower Internal Manways
Contract maintenance workers often will not replace the tray man-
ways unless the tray manway is adjacent to a tower external manway. 
They reason that once the tray manways that are visible from the 
tower manway are closed, there is no way for someone to inspect the 
other trays. This problem is not just common—it is universal.  
The maintenance force at the Good Hope Refinery pulled this nasty 
trick on me at the coker fractionator. Equipped with my crescent 
wrench, I opened the tray internal manway below the side tower man-
way. I discovered that the 12 trays below this point had their manways 
stacked in their downcomers. In 1990, I worked on a project to improve 
fractionation at the Chevron Refinery crude distillation unit in El 
Segundo, California. When the tower was opened to implement my 
design, the tray manways were found lying on the tray decks below 
the diesel draw tray. The lesson is, inspect each tray and then witness 
the closure of each tray manway, separately.

9.14  Conclusion
The most important job of the process engineer working in a refinery 
or chemical plant is to inspect tower internals during a turnaround. 
The unit engineer and the panel board operator should go through 
the tower together. Inspecting a 40-tray, two-pass crude distillation 
tower properly will take me 3 to 4 hours. It’s a dirty, difficult job. I 
once inspected such a tower at the Coffeyville, Kansas, refinery 
(remember the Dalton Brothers bank robbery in Coffeyville). What 
has helped me at this work is the experience of growing up in New 
York. I learned then that it’s best not to trust anyone. It’s best to see it 
yourself. Also, crawling through the trays is the only real way to 
understand how they work and what malfunctions can be expected.
I find it best to make a list of all nozzle locations relative to the 
tray number. This helps me check my location inside the tower. Also, 
I make a list of dimensions from the vendor tray drawings for easy 
reference in the column:
• Weir height
• Downcomer width and clearance
• Seal and draw-off pans
Most of my clients now use a digital camera to record tray condi-
tions. For me, this is good for record keeping only, not for decision 
making as to what tray repairs are needed. I suggest you make a copy 
of the checklist below, and refer to it when doing your next tower 
internal inspection.

How Instruments 
Work
Levels, Pressures,  
Flows, and  
Temperatures
I
n this age of advanced computer control, problems are still caused 
by the field instruments. The field instruments we discuss in this 
chapter are
• Level indicators
• Pressure indicators
• Flow indicators
• Temperature indicators
This chapter is particularly important when we consider that the 
data displayed in the control room are for operator control of the pro-
cess. Data for engineering purposes should be obtained locally, at the 
instrument itself. Further, a large percent of control problems are 
actually process malfunction problems.
10.1  Level
10.1.1  Level Indication
What is the difference between a gauge glass and a level glass? Simple! 
There is no such thing as a level glass. The liquid level shown in a 
gauge glass does not correspond to the level in a process vessel. 
Figure 10.1 is a good example. This is the bottom of an amine fuel-gas 
107

C h a p t e r  T e n
absorber. This tower is used to remove hydrogen sulfide from the fuel 
gas. At the bottom of the tower, there are three phases:
• Fuel gas: 0.01 specific gravity
• Hydrocarbon liquid: 0.60 specific gravity
• Rich amine: 0.98 specific gravity
Because of the location of the level taps of the gauge glass, only 
the amine is in the glass. The gauge glass simply measures the pres-
sure difference between two points of the tower (points A and B in 
Fig. 10.1). That is, the gauge glass functions as a manometer, which 
measures the pressure difference in terms of the specific gravity of 
the liquid in the gauge glass. Should the specific gravity of the liquid 
in the glass be the same as that of the liquid in the tower, both the 
gauge-glass level and the tower level would be the same. But this is 
never so. The specific gravity of the liquid in the gauge glass is always 
greater than the specific gravity of the liquid in the tower. Hence, the 
apparent liquid level in the gauge glass is always somewhat lower 
than the actual liquid level in the tower.
This discrepancy between the apparent level in the gauge glass and 
the actual level (see Fig. 10.1) in the tower also occurs in any other type 
of level-measuring device. This includes external float chambers, 
“kidneys,” displacement chambers, and level-trols. The one excep-
tion to this is level-measuring devices using radiation techniques.

The three causes of the discrepancy between the external level 
and the internal level are
• Foam formation inside tower
• Ambient-heat loss from the external gauge glass or level-trol
• The liquid specific gravity in the glass being greater than the 
specific gravity in the tower, as shown in Fig. 10.1
10.1.2  Level Discrepancies
Let’s assume that the gauge glass shown in Fig. 10.1 holds 6 ft of 
amine. Since the bottom tap is in the amine phase and the top tap is 
in the gas phase, the liquid hydrocarbon is excluded from the gauge 
glass. To balance out the weight of the 6 ft of amine, the tower would 
have to have about 2 ft of amine and 6 ft 8 inch of liquid hydrocarbon. 
That is, the tower liquid level would be about 8 ft 8 inch or 2 ft 8 inch 
higher than the gauge-glass level.
If you conclude from the above that we could use the gauge-glass 
level to actually calculate the level inside the tower, you are quite 
wrong. To perform the preceding calculation, one would have to 
assume the ratio of the phases. But this is an assumption equivalent to 
assuming the answer. How, then, does one determine the actual liq-
uid level in the tower on the basis of the apparent liquid level in the 
gauge glass? The answer is that there is no answer. It cannot be done! 
And this statement applies to all other sorts of level-measuring 
instruments—with the exception of radiation devices.
10.1.3  Effects of Temperature on Level
The gauge glass will normally be somewhat colder than the process 
vessel as a result of ambient-heat losses (an exception to this would 
be a refrigerated process). For every 100°F decrease in the gauge-
glass temperature or level-trol temperature, the specific gravity of 
the liquid in the glass increases by 5 percent. This rule of thumb is 
typical for hydrocarbons only. Aqueous (water-based) fluids are totally 
different.
For example, suppose the height of hydrocarbon liquid in a gauge 
glass is 4 ft between the level taps. The glass temperature is 60°F. The 
tower temperature is 560°F. How much higher is the height of liquid 
in the tower than in the glass? (Answer: 1 ft.)

• In other words, the liquid in the tower is 1 ft above the level

10.1.4  Plugged Taps
How do plugged level-sensing taps affect the apparent liquid level in 
a vessel? Let’s assume that the vapor in the vessel could be fully con-
densed at the temperature in the gauge glass. If the bottom tap is 
closed, the level will go up because the condensing vapors cannot 
drain out of the glass. If the top tap is closed, the level will go up 
because the condensing vapors create an area of low pressure, which 
draws the liquid up the glass through the bottom tap. Thus, if either 
the top or bottom taps plug, the result is a false high-level indication.
10.1.5  High Liquid Level
In our calculation above, we had 4 ft of liquid in the glass and 5 ft of 
liquid in the tower. But what happens if the distance between the two 
taps is 4 ft 6 inch? I have drawn a picture of the observed result in 
Fig. 10.2. Liquid circulates through the glass, pouring through the top 
tap, and draining through the bottom tap. The apparent liquid level

would then be somewhere between 4 ft 0 inch and 4 ft 6 inch; let’s say 
4 ft 2 inch. The indicated liquid level on the control room chart would 
then be 92 percent (i.e., 4 ft 2 inch ÷ 4 ft 6 inch). As the liquid level in 
the tower increases from 5 ft to 1000 ft, the indicated liquid level 
would remain at 92 percent.
Once the actual liquid level inside the tower bottom rises above 
the top-level tap, no further increase in level can be observed in the 
gauge glass. We say the level indication is “tapped out.” 
The same sort of problem arises in a level-trol, which measures 
and transmits a process vessel liquid level to the control center. As 
shown in Fig. 10.3, the level-trol operates by means of two pressure 
transducers, devices for converting a pressure signal into a small elec-
tric current. The difference between the two pressure transducers 
shown in Fig. 10.3 is called the milliamp (milliampere) output. This 
milliamp output is proportional to the pressure difference between 
the bottom and top taps in the level-trol. To convert the milliamp out-
put signal from the level-trol into a level indication, the instrument 
technician must assume a specific gravity:
Percent level ~ milliamp signal
specific gravity
But which specific gravity should the instrument technician 
select? The specific gravity of the liquid in the level-trol, or the lower 
specific gravity of the liquid in the hotter process vessel? The techni-
cian should use the specific gravity in the process vessel and ignore

the specific gravity of the liquid in the level-trol. This can be espe-
cially confusing, if the operator then compares the apparently low 
liquid level in the gauge glass to the indicated higher liquid level on 
the control panel.
10.2  Foam Affects Levels
Trying to predict a vessel level based on the output from the pressure 
transducers would work only if one knew the actual specific gravity 
of the fluid in the bottom of a distillation tower. But anyone who has 
ever poured out a glass of beer realizes that this is not possible. For 
one thing, the ratio of white froth to yellow beer is never known in 
advance. Also, the density of the froth itself is unknown and is quite 
variable.
Figure 10.4 shows a distillation tower served by a circulating 
thermosyphon reboiler. To some unknown extent, some foam will 
always be found in the bottom of such vessels. Not sometimes, but 
always. Why?
The purpose of a tray is to mix vapor and liquid. This produces 
aerated liquid—or foam. The purpose of a reboiler is to produce vapor. 
In a circulating reboiler, the reboiler effluent flows up the riser as a 
froth. Of course, the flow from the bottom of the tower is going to be a 
clear liquid. Foam cannot be pumped. But there will always be some 
ratio of foam to clear liquid in the bottom of the tower, and we have no 
method of determining this ratio or even the density of the foam.

Well, if we do not know the average specific gravity of the foamy 
liquid in the bottom of a tower, how can we find the level of foam in 
the tower? The unfortunate answer is that, short of using radiation 
techniques, we cannot.
10.2.1  Split Liquid Levels
The two gauge glasses shown in Fig. 10.4 both show a liquid level. 
Many of you may have observed this on a process vessel. We cer-
tainly cannot have layers of liquid-vapor-liquid-vapor in the vessel. 
Rather, these split liquid levels are a positive indication of foam or 
froth in the bottom of the tower.
If the foam is spanning both taps on a gauge glass, then the height 
of the liquid in the glass is a measure of the specific gravity or density 
of the foam in terms of the specific gravity of the liquid in the glass. If 
the foam is above the top tap of both the gauge glasses in Fig. 10.4, 
then there will be a level in both glasses. The upper gauge glass will 
show a lower level because the light foam in the tower floats on the 
top of the heavier foam. Note that these split liquid levels, so often 
seen in a process vessel, tell us nothing about the real liquid level in 
the vessel. They are a sign of foam.
Figure 10.5 is a plot of the liquid level in a crude preflash drum 
versus time. We were steadily withdrawing 10 percent more flashed 
crude from the bottoms pump than the inlet crude feed rate. The rate 
of decline of the liquid level noted in the control center was only 
about 25 percent of our calculated rate. Suddenly, when the apparent 
level in the control room had reached 40 percent, the level indication 
started to decline much more rapidly. Why?
This extreme non-linear response of a level to a step change in a 
flow rate is quite common. Before the sudden decline in the indicated

liquid level, foam had filled the drum above the top-level tap. The 
initial slow decline in the apparent level was due to a dense foam 
dropping between the level taps being replaced by a lighter foam. 
Only when the foam level actually dropped below the top tap of the 
drum did the indicated liquid level begin to decline at a rate repre-
senting the actual decline in the level. Thus, we can see that this com-
mon, non-linear response is not due to instrument malfunctions, but 
is a sure sign of foam or froth.
10.2.2  Radiation Level Detection
The only way around the sort of problems discussed above is to use 
neutrons or x-rays to measure the density in a vessel. In a modern 
petroleum refinery, perhaps 5 percent of levels are monitored with 
radi­a­tion. It is both safe and effective.
The neutron backscatter technique is best performed with hydrogen-
containing products. Both the source of the slow neutrons and the 
receiver are located in the same box. The slow neutrons bounce off 
protons (hydrogen ions) and are reflected back. The rate at which 
these neutrons are reflected back is measured, and corresponds to the 
hydrocarbon density in the vessel. This measurement is not affected 
by steel components inside—or outside—the vessel.
X-ray level detection works with a source of radiation and a 
receiver, located on either side of the vessel. As the percent absorption 
of the radiation increases, the receiver sees fewer x-rays and a higher 
density is implied. The x-rays are absorbed by steel components, such 
as ladders and manways, which can sometimes be confusing.
Either method discriminates nicely between clear liquid, foam, or 
vapor. Such a level controller can be calibrated to hold a foam level or 
a liquid level. Of course, this sort of level detection is far more expen-
sive than conventional techniques.
10.2.3  Lost Radiation Source
But let me be completely honest. I once had a radiation level detector 
on a spent sulfuric acid tank. I was the operating superintendent at 
this plant, which regenerated sulfuric acid. We had a not-so-small fire 
at this tank. Rather than repair the tank, pumps, and lines, I decided 
to dismantle and haul away the entire mess of steel. After all, I had 
much larger and more modern storage tanks at my disposal. 
After the dismantled equipment had been trucked away, my boss 
said, “And where, Lieberman, is the nuclear level detector radiation 
source? I imagine even you must realize that these radioactive sources 
are licensed. God help us if you have lost it.”
I explained to him that man does not live by reason alone. That 
my loss of the radiation source for the level detector would not affect 
the ultimate fate of the universe. Unfortunately, my boss had a narrow-
minded view of this incident.

10.3  Pressure
10.3.1  Pressure Indicators
The chief engineer of a West Texas process plant had decided to 
replace the main condenser. Colder weather always coincided with a 
vastly improved vacuum in their vacuum tower. It seemed as if colder 
air to the condenser really helped. So the chief engineer concluded 
that a bigger condenser would also help during warm weather.
Wrong! The chief engineer failed to realize that the vacuum pres-
sure indicator was not equipped with a barometric pressure compensator. 
An ordinary vacuum pressure indicator or pressure gauge reads the 
pressure difference between the vacuum system and atmospheric 
pressure. When ambient temperatures drop, the barometer rises or 
ambient pressure goes up. An ordinary vacuum pressure gauge or 
indicator would then read an improved vacuum. But in reality, the 
vacuum has not changed.
The opposite problem would occur in Denver—the Mile-High 
City. At sea level, full vacuum is 30 inches of mercury (or 30 inches Hg). 
But in Denver, full vacuum is about 26 inches Hg. An ordinary vacuum 
pressure gauge reads zero inches of mercury (0 inch Hg) in Denver and 
in New Orleans, because although these cities are at different altitudes, 
the vacuum pressure gauge compares system pressure only with ambi-
ent pressure. But a vacuum pressure gauge reading 25 inches Hg in 
New Orleans would correspond to a poor vacuum of 5 inches Hg abso-
lute pressure (30 inches Hg−25 inches Hg). A vacuum pressure gauge 
reading 25 inches Hg in Denver would correspond to an excellent vac-
uum of 1 inch Hg absolute pressure (26 inches Hg−25 inches Hg).
All these complications can be avoided when making field 
measurements by using the vacuum manometer shown in Fig. 10.6.

The difference between the two mercury levels is the correct inches of 
mercury absolute pressure, or millimeters of mercury (mm Hg). A 
drop of water on the evacuated end of the manometer will result in a 
falsely low vacuum reading.
10.3.2  Pressure Transducers
Disassemble a pressure transducer, and you will see a small plastic 
diaphragm. A change in pressure distorts this diaphragm and gener-
ates a small electrical signal. The signal must be quite tiny, because 
placing your hand on the transducer can alter its reading. A modern 
digital pressure gauge uses a pressure transducer. This type of gauge, 
if zeroed at sea level in New Orleans, will read 4 inches of Hg vacuum 
in Denver. Most pressure signals transmitted from the field into the 
control center are generated from pressure transducers. Differential 
pressure indicators simply take the differential readings from two 
transducers and generate a milliamp output signal.
10.3.3  Pressure-Point Location
Locating a pressure tap in an area of high velocity is likely to produce 
a lower pressure indication than the real flowing pressure. Using a 
purge gas to keep a pressure tap from plugging often can cause a high 
pressure reading if too much purge gas or steam is used. A pressure 
tap located below a liquid level will read too high; pressures should 
be measured in the vapor phase. A pressure tap opposite an inlet 
nozzle with a high velocity will read higher than the real pressure.
10.4  Flow
10.4.1  Flow Indication
The standard method of measuring flows in a process plant is by use 
of the orifice plate and orifice flanges, shown in Fig. 10.7. Actually, we 
rarely measure flows directly. More commonly, we measure the pres-
sure drop across an orifice plate. This pressure drop is due to the 
increase in kinetic energy of a fluid as it accelerates through the small 
hole in the orifice plate. The energy to provide the increased velocity 
comes from the pressure of the flowing fluid in accordance with the 
following:
62.3

where	 DP = measured pressure drop through the orifice plate, in

in psi by 27.7 to obtain the inches of water DP)
	
V = velocity of the fluid through the orifice plate, ft/s
	
Df = density of the fluid, whether vapor or liquid, lb/ft3
	
K = an orifice coefficient

	
H o w  I n s t r u m e n t s  W o r k 	
117
You should look up the orifice coefficient K in your Cameron or Crane 
handbook—but it is typically a number like 0.6 to 0.8.
10.4.2  Checking Flows in the Field
The competent engineer does not assume a flow indication shown on 
the control panel is correct, but proceeds as follows:
 
1. Referring to Fig. 10.7, place an easy-to-read pressure gauge in 
the position shown. I like to use a digital gauge.
	
2.	 By opening both valves A and B, with C closed, you will now 
be reading the upstream pressure.
 
3. By opening valve C, with A and B closed, you will read the 
pressure downstream of the orifice plate.
	
4.	 The difference between the two readings is DP in the preced-
ing equation. Now solve for V.
 
5. Look at the tab sticking out of the orifice flanges (see Fig. 10.7). If 
the orifice plate is installed in the correct direction, there will be 
a number stamped onto the tab, toward the flow. This is the ori-
fice plate hole diameter; for example, if you see 0.374'' stamped 
on the tab, the orifice hole diameter should be 0.374 inch.
 
6. Using the hole diameter, calculate the volume of fluid.
Suppose the flowing fluid is water. Assume the area of the orifice 
is 0.1 ft2. The observed ∆P = 4 psi. Converting psi to inches of water:
1 psi = 27.7 inches H2O

Therefore the observed ∆P expressed as inches H2O is:
4 × 27.7 = 110.8 inches H2O
The linear flow rate (V) in ft/s is found from
∆P inches H2O = orifice coefficient × V2
Suppose the orifice coefficient is 0.6 (which would be typical); then:

We find the volumetric flow rate (F) in ft3/s after multiplying by 
the cross-sectional area of the orifice opening, thus in this case:
F = 13.6 ft/s × 0.1 ft2 = 1.36 ft3/s
You may notice when you measure DP that it is a small value, dif-
ficult to measure accurately. This means that the orifice plate hole is 
oversized, and that the accuracy of the recorded flow on the control 
panel is also poor, or the measured DP is quite high. This means that 
a lot of pressure is being wasted, and the orifice plate hole is under-
sized and restricting flow. Furthermore, the recorded flow on the con-
trol panel may be off scale.
The reason the orifice flanges are kept close to the orifice plate is 
that when the liquid velocity decreases downstream of the orifice 
plate, the pressure of the liquid goes partly back up. Figure 10.8

H o w  I n s t r u m e n t s  W o r k 	
119
illustrates this point. It is called pressure recovery. Whenever the veloc-
ity of a flowing fluid (vapor or liquid) decreases, its pressure goes 
partly back up. An extreme example of this is water hammer. The rea-
son the pressure at the end of the pipe in Fig. 10.8 is lower than at the 
inlet to the pipe is due to frictional losses.
The orifice coefficient K takes into account both frictional pres-
sure losses, and conversion of pressure to velocity. The frictional 
losses represent an irreversible process. The conversion of pressure to 
velocity represent a reversible process.
10.4.3  Other Flow-Measuring Methods
A better way of measuring flows than the ordinary orifice plate 
method is by inducing vortex shedding across a tube in the flowing 
liquid and then measuring the velocity of the vortices. This is a nice 
method, as there are no orifice taps to plug. Then there are Doppler 
meters, which measure the velocity of a fluid based on how the speed 
of sound is affected by the flow in a pipe. More commonly, we have 
rotometers, which measure how far a ball or float is lifted in a vertical 
tube by the velocity of the liquid. But regardless of their relative mer-
its, perhaps simply for historical reasons, the vast majority of flows in 
most process plants are measured with the orifice plate flowmeter, 
shown in Fig. 10.7.
10.4.4  Glycol-Filled Instrument Lines
Many of us have seen the following tag attached to level-sensing 
lines or to a flow transmitter: “Do not drain—glycol-filled.” This 
means the instrument mechanic has filled the lines with glycol, 
mainly for winter freeze protection. Many process streams contain 
water, which can settle out at low points and, in effect, plug the 
impulse lines to flow- or level-sensing DP transmitters when water 
freezes. Note that there is not a lot of difference between measuring 
a flow and a level; they both are typically measured by using a dif-
ferential pressure signal.
Naturally, just like level indicators, the flow orifice taps can plug. 
If the upstream tap plugs, the flow will read low or zero. It is best to 
blow the tap back with glycol, but that is not always practical. If you 
blow the taps out with the pressure of the process stream, you do not 
need to refill the impulse lines with glycol to get a correct flow read-
ing. But the lines have to be totally refilled with the same fluid. If you 
are measuring the flow of a single-phase liquid, just open valves A, B, 
and C (shown in Fig. 10.7) for a few minutes. If you are working with 
vapor at its dew point or wet gas, there is a problem. If the flow trans-
mitter is located below the orifice flanges, you will have to wait until 
the impulse lines refill with liquid. Open valve B, and close valves A 
and C. Now wait until the flowmeter indication stops changing. It 
ought to go back to zero, if the lines are refilled.

10.4.5  Zeroing Out a Flowmeter
The indicated flow of acetic acid is 9000 liters per day. The instrument 
technician checks the flowmeter to see if it has drifted by opening 
valve B with A and C closed (see Fig. 10.7). It should go back to zero—
but a reading of 2000 liters per day is noted. The full range on the 
flowmeter is 10,000 liters per day. What is the real flow rate of the 
acetic acid? The answer is not 7000 liters. Why? Because flow varies 
with the square root of the orifice plate pressure drop. To calculate the 
correct acetic acid flow:
• 90002 - 20002 = 77,000,000
• (77,000,000)1/2 = 8780 liters per day
The lesson is that near the top end of its range, the indicated flow 
is likely to be accurate, even if the meter is not well zeroed or the 
measured DP is not too accurate. On the other hand, flowmeters using 
orifice plates cannot be very accurate at the low end of their range, 
regardless of how carefully we have zeroed them. Digitally displayed 
flows also follow this rule.
10.5  Temperature
10.5.1  Temperature Indication
Figure 10.9 shows an ordinary thermowell-and-thermocouple assem-
bly. The thermocouple junction consists of two wires of different met-
als. When this junction of the wires is heated, a small electric current, 
proportional to the junction temperature, is produced. Different 
metal wires make up the three most common junctions: J, H, and K.

H o w  I n s t r u m e n t s  W o r k 	
121
It is not uncommon for a thermocouple, regardless of the type of 
junction, to generate too low a temperature signal.
If the exterior of the thermowell becomes fouled, the indicated 
temperature, generated by the thermocouple, will drop. The problem 
is that the external cap of the thermowell assembly radiates a small 
amount of heat to the atmosphere. Normally, this has a negligible 
effect on the indicated temperature. However, when the process tem-
perature is 600 to 800°F, the thermowell is in a vapor phase, and the 
thermowell becomes coated with coke. I have seen the indicated tem-
perature drop by 40°F below its true value. To verify that fouling of a 
thermowell is a problem, place a piece of loose insulation over the 
exterior thermowell assembly. If the indicated temperature rises by  
5 or 10°F, then fouling on the outside of the thermowell is proved.
10.5.2  Short Thermowells
For a thermocouple to read correctly, it should be fully inserted in a 
thermowell and the thermowell itself should extend several inches 
into the process liquid. If the process stream is a vapor, which has 
poorer heat-transfer properties than do liquids, the thermowell, espe-
cially if the external insulation is poor, should extend more than 6 inch 
into the process flow. To check the length of the thermowell, unscrew 
the thermocouple assembly and pull it out, then simply measure the 
length of the thermocouple. This is also a good opportunity to verify 
the control-room reading with a portable temperature probe or a 
glass thermometer inserted in the thermowell. About 5 percent of the 
T1 points used are not located where the unit piping and instrumenta-
tion diagrams (P&IDs) show them to be. Then, pulling the thermo-
couple from a point in the process sometimes causes an unexpected 
drop to ambient temperature at an entirely unexpected T1 location.
10.5.3  Safety Note
Figure 10.9 is somewhat misleading. It implies that most thermowells 
are welded in place. Typically, thermowells are screwed into a 1-inch 
nozzle in the vessel wall.
I talked in the preceding section about unscrewing a thermocou-
ple. This is perfectly safe. The same comment applies to extracting a 
screwed-in dial thermometer from a thermowell. However, some-
times less experienced people have made a deadly error in unscrew-
ing a thermowell instead of a thermocouple.
Unscrewing a thermowell opens up the process fluid directly to 
the atmosphere. I myself once almost caused the death of a young 
engineer in Chalmette, Louisiana, when I told him to unscrew a ther-
mowell. But I meant to say a thermocouple on a 300-psig, 500°F diesel 
oil pipe. He had the thermowell halfway out when I stopped him.
“Next time,” I shouted, “pay attention to what I’m thinking, not 
what I’m saying.”

C h a p t e r  T e n
10.5.4  Ram’s-Horn Level Indication
A too short thermowell in the side of a vessel will increase in tem-
perature when the liquid level rises to submerge the thermowell.  
Figure 10.10 illustrates a common method of exploiting this phenom-
enon. This is the ram’s-horn interface-level indicator. The thermowell 
extends to the vessel wall only and is poorly insulated. The curved 
pipe below the thermowell permits liquid to drain out of and through 
the pipe enclosing the thermowell. Usually, three or four such ram’s 
horns are vertically set 18 inch apart. A sudden temperature increase 
at a ram’s horn is a foolproof method of detecting a rise in a liquid 
level. Especially in fouling or plugging service, I have seen this sim-
ple, archaic method of level indication succeed when all else fails.
If two temperature readings from the same point in the process 
disagree, the chances are that a temperature indication is more accu-
rate than a temperature-control signal. The temperature signal used 
for control has usually been converted from its direct milliamp out-
put to operate a control station. The temperature indication is gener-
ated right from the junction of the thermocouple, and hence there is 
less chance for error.

CHAPTER   1 1
Packed Towers: 
Better Than Trays?
Packed-Bed Vapor and 
Liquid Distribution
T
he very first continuous distillation column was the Patent  
Still used to produce Scotch whiskey in the 1830s. It had 
12 bubble-cap trays with weirs, downcomers, tray decks, and 
bubble caps with internal risers. Current trayed towers are quite sim-
ilar. As most distillation towers have always been trayed rather than 
packed, one would have to conclude that trayed towers must have 
some sort of inherent advantage over packed towers. And this is 
indeed true in a practical sense, even though, in theory, a packed 
tower has greater capacity and superior separation efficiency than a 
trayed column.
11.1  How Packed Towers Work
The original packed towers used Raschig rings, hollow ceramic cylin-
ders, typically 1 inch outer diameter (OD), 0.75 inch inner diameter 
(ID), and 1 inch long. A state-of-the-art packing is called structured 
packing. This material is made of thin sheets of crimped or corrugated 
metal, with small holes, fastened together with thin bars. The metal 
selected for the sheets is typically 316 stainless steel.
The two features that should be maximized in packed beds are:
• Open area—the average percentage of the cross-sectional area 
of the tower not blocked by the packing, and hence available 
for the flow of vapor and liquid.
• Wetted surface area—the number of square feet of packing sur-
face area available for vapor-liquid contacting, per cubic foot 
of tower volume.
123

	
124	
C h a p t e r  E l e v e n
The greater the open area of packing, the greater the capacity of a 
tower. The greater the wetted surface area of a packing, the greater 
the separation efficiency of the tower. For example, a packing consist-
ing of empty space would have lots of capacity but awful separation 
efficiency. A packing consisting of a fine sand would have great sepa-
ration efficiency but very low capacity. So the selection of packing for 
a column is a compromise between maximizing open area and maxi-
mizing the wetted surface area.
Structured packing has about 50 percent more open area than 
Raschig rings and two or three times their wetted surface area. Hence, 
structured packing has largely replaced packing in the form of rings 
in many packed towers.
In any type of packed tower, the liquid or internal reflux drips 
through the packing and forms a thin film of liquid on the surface of 
the packing. Vapor percolates up through the packing and exchanges 
heat and molecules with the thin film of liquid on the surface of the 
packing.
In a trayed tower, vapor-liquid contact occurs only 5 or 6 inches 
above the tray deck, and the majority of the tower’s volume is not 
used to exchange heat or mass between vapor and liquid. In a 
packed tower, the entire packed volume is used for this vapor-liquid 
contacting.
In a trayed tower, the area used for the downcomer that feeds the 
liquid to a tray and the area used for draining liquid from a tray are 
unavailable for vapor flow. In a packed tower, the entire cross- 
sectional area of the tower is available for vapor flow.
This certainly makes it seem as if packing is vastly superior to 
trays, and even if this was not true in the past, with the advent of struc-
tured packings in the 1980s it ought to be true now. But as a process 
design engineer, whenever possible I still specify trays rather than 
packing. Why?
11.1.1  Liquid Distribution
Each tray in a tower is inherently a vapor-liquid redistributor. The 
holes in the tray decks redistribute the vapor flowing up the tower. 
The outlet weir, or more exactly the crest height of the liquid over-
flowing the weir, forces the liquid to flow evenly across the tray. Even 
if the weir height is uneven on a tray, and liquid flow is distorted on 
that particular tray, the liquid will be properly redistributed on the 
tray below.
Unfortunately, packing does not redistribute liquid or internal 
reflux. Unless the initial reflux distribution is good, the liquid flow 
distribution through the entire packed bed will be poor. Figure 11.1 
shows a common orifice plate liquid distributor. Vapor flows up 
through the large chimneys, and liquid drains through the smaller 
distribution holes in the tray deck.

125
To calculate the height of liquid on this chimney tray, we have to 
add two factors:
• The pressure drop of the vapor flowing through the chim-
neys. The liquid on the tray has to develop enough liquid 
head to flow against the higher pressure below the tray.
• The orifice hole pressure drop. This is the liquid head, which 
has to be converted to velocity as the liquid flows through the 
orifice holes on the tray deck.
The pressure drop of the vapor flowing through the chimneys is

holes, in inches of clear liquid
	
K0 = an orifice coefficient for a hole in metal plate, typically 
0.4 to 0.6
	
VL = velocity of liquid draining through the orifice holes, ft/s
The sum of DPV + DPL is the total height of liquid on the chimney 
tray. Let us assume that this total height is 6 inches of liquid:
• DPV = 5.1 inch
• DPL = 0.9 inch
Let’s further assume that the orifice plate distributor is 1 inch out 
of level. This could easily happen in a 14-ft 0-inch-ID tower. Figure 11.2 
shows the results. The flow of internal reflux or liquid through the 
higher portion of the tray deck falls to zero. Worse yet, vapor starts to 
bubble up through any orifice hole that is not submerged by at least 
5.1 inch of clear liquid. But, of course, once vapor bubbling begins, we 
do not have clear liquid in this region of the tray deck.
Meanwhile, all the liquid flow must drain through the lower 
portion of the tray. The net result, as can be seen in Fig. 11.2, is  
dry packing in one portion of the tower and overrefluxing in the adja-
cent portion. This is called vapor-liquid channeling, and this is the 
root cause of poor fractionation efficiency in any tower.
One way out of this problem is to increase DPL the pressure drop 
of the liquid flowing through the orifice holes. This could be done by 
increasing the orifice hole liquid velocity. We could drill fewer orifice 
holes. Unfortunately, this would decrease the number of drip points 
per square foot of tower area (6 to 10 is a good target). This would

127
reduce vapor-liquid contacting efficiency. Or we could have smaller 
orifice holes. But too small a hole would probably plug with corrosion 
products.
There are ways around these problems. Figure 11.3 is a simplified 
sketch of a multipan liquid distributor using raised, slotted, guided 
drip tubes employing an initial distribution header. It is beyond the 
scope of this text to describe how this works. But I will say that such 
liquid distributors are:
• Expensive to build
• Tricky to design—especially for small liquid flows
• Difficult to install correctly
• Occupy quite a few feet of tower vertical height
11.1.1.1  Trade-Off between Efficiency and Capacity
In a trayed tower, we can increase tower capacity by reducing the num-
ber of trays and increasing the tray spacing. But reducing the number of 
trays in turn reduces separation efficiency. In a packed tower, we can 
increase tower capacity by using larger packing and increasing the 
open area (or a bigger crimp size for structured packing). But the reduc-
tion in the wetted area of the packing will reduce separation efficiency. 
Installing a properly designed, efficient liquid distributor, such as the 
Packed bed

C h a p t e r  E l e v e n
one shown in Fig. 11.3, will definitely enhance separation efficiency, but 
at the expense of the vertical height of the tower, which could otherwise 
be devoted to a greater height of packing.
11.1.2  Vapor Distribution
Figure 11.4 shows a modern, narrow-trough, liquid collector–vapor 
distributor chimney tray. While the initial vapor distribution through 
a packed bed is not quite so critical or difficult as the liquid distribu-
tion, it is still important.
A properly designed valve or sieve tray will act as a vapor redis-
tributor. Thus, poor initial vapor distribution will only lessen the effi-
ciency of the bottom tray. But if a packed-bed vapor distributor does 
not work properly, vapor channeling will be promoted through the 
entire bed.
The narrow-trough vapor distributor shown in Fig. 11.4 is 
intended to disperse the vapor evenly across the bottom of the packed 
bed. The width of the chimney does not exceed 6 in. The older-style

chimney trays, which may have had a few large round or square 
chimneys, reduced the separation efficiency of the packing. To work 
properly, the vapor distributor has to have a reasonable pressure 
drop in comparison to the pressure drop of the packed bed. For exam-
ple, if the expected pressure drop of a 12-ft packed bed is 10 inches of 
liquid, the pressure drop of the vapor distributor ought to be about 3 
to 4 inches of liquid.
In practice, the most common reason why vapor flow is maldis-
tributed as it escapes from a well-designed chimney tray is distortion 
of the hats. I believe this is due mostly to workers stepping on the 
hats during unit turnarounds. The hat support brackets are designed 
to support a 20-lb hat, not a 200-lb welder.
11.2  Maintaining Functional and Structural Efficiency  
in Packed Towers
11.2.1  Pressure Drop
A packed tower can successfully fractionate with a very small pressure 
drop, as compared to a tray. For a modern trayed tower, to produce one 
single theoretical tray worth of separation (that’s like a single, 100-percent 
efficient tray), a pressure drop of about 6 inch of liquid is needed. A bed 
of structured packing can do the same job with 1 inch of liquid pressure 
drop, even when allowing for the vapor distributor. In low-pressure 
fractionators, especially vacuum towers used to make lubricating oils 
and waxes, this can be of critical importance.
Packed beds also seem to have a better turndown capability than 
valve or sieve trays at low vapor flows. On the other hand, many 
packed fractionators seem quite intolerant of reduced liquid or reflux 
flow rates. This is typically a sign of an improperly designed distribu-
tor in the packed fractionator.
The problem we have just discussed—poor fractionation effi-
ciency due to inadequate vapor and liquid initial distribution—is 
rather similar to tray deck dumping in trayed fractionators. And, just 
like trays, packed towers are also subject to flooding.
11.2.2  Flooding in Packed Towers
To understand what is meant by flooding in a bed of packing, one 
ought to first understand what is meant by the idea of holdup.
Let’s imagine we are operating the air-water scrubber in the Unit-
Ops Lab at Cooper Union School of Engineering (Fig. 11.5). The water 
is circulating from the bottom to the top of the tower. The water level 
in the bottom is 2 ft. The height of the packed bed is 20 ft. At 3:30 p.m., 
Professor Liebskind shuts off our air compressor and the water circu-
lation pump. As the water, which had been held up on the packing by 

	
130	
C h a p t e r  E l e v e n
the flowing air, drains down, the water level in the bottom of the 
tower rises from 2 to 5 ft. We say, then, that the holdup of the packing 
was 15 percent [(5 ft - 2 ft) ÷ 20 ft = 15 percent].
If the liquid holdup is too low, fractionation efficiency will be bad. 
We say that the height equivalent to a theoretical plate (HETP) will be high. 
If the liquid holdup is too high, fractionation efficiency will also be 
poor. We again say that the HETP will be high. This idea is expressed 
in Fig. 11.6. When the holdup rises above the point that corresponds to 
the minimum HETP, we can say that the packing is beginning to flood. 
The minimum HETP point in Fig. 11.6 corresponds to the point of an 
incipient flood, discussed in Chap. 3, for trayed towers.
For structured-type packing, a liquid holdup of 4 to 5 percent cor-
responds to this optimum packing fractionation efficiency. For 1-inch 
Raschig rings, this optimum holdup would be roughly 10 to 12 percent.

There is a close relationship between percent liquid holdup and 
pressure drop, as expressed in inches of liquid per foot of packing. If 
the pressure drop per foot of packing is 1.2 inch, then the liquid holdup 
is roughly 10 percent (1.2 inch ÷ 12 inch = 10 percent). Unlike the perfo-
rated tray decks discussed in Chap. 3, there is no simple equation to 
predict the optimum pressure drop that would correspond to the min-
imum HETP for different types of packing. There is just too much 
diversity in both size and shape to generalize. I can, however, recall a 
delayed coking fractionator in Los Angeles with a 7-ft bed of structured 
packing. When the pressure drop per foot of packing reached 4 inch 
(due to coke formation), drainage of liquid through the bed ceased.
11.2.2.1  Packed-Bed Supports
A simple support for a bed of 1.5-inch pall rings might consist of a bar 
grid with 0.25-inch-thick bars set on 1-inch center. The grid itself (see 
Fig. 11.7) would be supported by two 6-inch-wide I-beams. The open 
area of each component is
• 1.5-inch pall rings: 80 percent
• Grid support: 75 percent
• I-beam support: 90 percent
Considering that the rings, the grid support, and the I-beam are 
all in close physical contact, what is the open area at their mutual 
interface? (Answer: 80 percent × 75 percent × 90 percent = 54 percent.) 
This means that there will be a restriction to vapor and liquid flow at 
the grid support, which will promote flooding at the bottom of the 
bed. Naturally, this would cause the entire packed bed to flood.

To avoid such flooding, the designer uses the corrugated bed sup-
port shown in Fig. 11.8. This grid will have over 100-percent open 
area based on the tower cross-sectional area. Crushed packing lying 
on even this excellent type of bed support can, however, cause flood-
ing if the crushed packing has lost most of its open area.

11.2.3  Packing Holddowns
During routine operations, the weight of a bed of packing is sufficient 
to keep it in place. But if there is a pressure surge during start-up, the 
packed bed can be forcefully pushed against the underside of the  
liquid distributor. If this liquid distributor is a spray header, as illus-
trated in Fig. 11.9, the spray bar arms can be bent. To prevent this, a 
packing top holddown grid is required. This holddown grid must be 
firmly attached to the vessel wall. For example, in a 12-ft-ID tower, 
the holddown grid is designed to resist an uplift force due to a pres-
sure surge of 0.5 psi. What is the total uplift force?

Figure 11.10 illustrates a problem introduced when a packing 
holddown was installed at the wrong elevation. This tower was 
designed to purify acetic acid by distilling overhead the lighter for-
mic acid. But at even 50 percent of the design reboiler duty, the tower 
flooded, and acetic acid was carried over into the formic acid. The 
problem was that the perforated plate holddown used to keep the 
1.5-inch Teflon rings from floating up through the feed chimney tray 
distributor was located immediately below these chimneys. What, 
then, was the open area at the interface of the chimney feed distribu-
tor, the 1.5-inch rings, and the holddown plate?
• Open area of chimney feed distributor = 40 percent
• Open area of rings = 70 percent

• Open area of holddown plate = 30 percent  
(Answer: 40 percent × 70 percent × 30 percent = 8.4 percent.)
As a result, the tower flooded above the holddown plate. To fix 
this problem, the packing holddown was dropped 15 inch below the 
chimney tray. As a result, the tower fractionated properly.
Incidentally, this incident was a multimillion-dollar mistake. It 
was not, however, a design error. The installation crew had simply 
found a “cheaper” location to install the holddown grid by using the 
same support as the chimney feed distributor.
11.2.4  Crushed Packing
One of the great disadvantages of packing is the inability to properly 
inspect the installation. I well remember one coal gasification project in 
Chicago, where the off-gas scrubber flooded because of a plastic bag 
left inside a packed bed of pall rings. On another tower, flooding of a 
bed of structured packing occurred at 50 percent of design. Only when 
the packing was removed for inspection was the problem revealed. 
Workers had previously stepped on and crushed intermediate layers of 
packing. Then, probably without realizing that they had reduced the 
open area of the structured packing by 50 percent, they set additional 
layers of structured packing on top of the damaged layers.
The situation on a trayed tower is far more controllable. Even 
after the tray assembly is complete, the process engineer, using only 
a crescent wrench, can open a few tray deck manways and double-
check the tower internals. But to pull 6 ft of packing out of a tower is 
a major undertaking. Also, trays can be stepped on without damage.

with impunity. Packings—rings or structured—require special han-
dling during installation or turnarounds. To be frank, all packing 
installations that I have seen have been damaged to some extent.
To summarize, the chief disadvantages of packed towers, as com-
pared to trays, are
• Difficulty of achieving proper initial liquid distribution, espe-
cially at small liquid flow rates
• The need for a proper vapor distributor to achieve proper  
initial vapor distribution
• Possible restrictions to vapor flow from the packing grid sup-
port or holddown
• Problems in inspecting the final installation
11.3  Advantages of Packing vs. Trays
Often, we remove heat from a tower at an intermediate point by use 
of a pumparound or circulating reflux. Figure 11.11 is a sketch of such 
a pumparound. In many towers, the liquid flows in the pumparound

section are greater than in the other sections, which are used for frac-
tionation. That is why we are often short of capacity and initiate 
flooding in the pumparound or heat-removal section of a column.
Since we do not rely on pumparounds to fractionate—but just to 
remove heat—good vapor-liquid distribution is not critical. A bed of 
4 or 5 ft of structured packing is often, then, an excellent selection for 
the pumparound section of a tower. The capacity of such a bed poten-
tially has a 30 to 40 percent advantage over trays.
Once a tower’s diameter is 3 ft or less, trays become difficult to 
install, due to the confined working area. Also, the tray support ring 
appreciably cuts down on the tower’s cross-sectional area. Dumped-
type packings (rings, saddles, broken beer bottles) do not present 
such problems. Also, for high liquid flows in a smaller-diameter 
tower (less than 5 ft), a well-designed packed tower will have a very 
substantial capacity advantage over a trayed tower. In general, the 
lower the pressure of a tower, the greater the advantage of using 
packing over trays.
Finally, the pressure drop of the vapor flowing through a packed 
tower will be an order of magnitude less than through a trayed tower. 
For vacuum distillation service, this is often of critical importance.

Water Hammer and Condensate 
Backup Steam-Side Reboiler Control
In this chapter we discuss process equipment such as
• The steam side of reboilers
• Steam turbine surface condensers
• Condensate recovery systems
• Deaerators
• The steam side of shell-and-tube steam preheaters
A few of the nasty features of this sort of process equipment we 
discuss are
• Condensate backup
• Accumulation of carbon dioxide
• Steam hammer
• Blown condensate seals
12.1  Steam Reboilers
When considering the steam side of steam-heated reboilers, it is best 
to think about the reboiler as a steam condenser. The steam, at least 
for a conventional horizontal reboiler, is usually on the tube side of 
the exchanger, as shown in Fig. 12.1. The steam is on the tube side, 
137

C h a p t e r  T w e l v e
because the shell side was selected for the process fluid. If the reboiler 
is a thermosyphon, or natural-circulation reboiler, then low-process-
side pressure drop is important. For a horizontal reboiler, it is easiest 
to obtain a low pressure drop for the fluid being vaporized by placing 
it on the shell side.
The steam enters through the top of the channel head of the reboiler. 
Any superheat in the steam is quickly lost to the tubes. Superheating 
steam does very little in increasing heat-transfer rates in a reboiler. 
Actually, when considering the temperature difference between the 
steam and the process fluid, it is best to use the saturated steam tem-
perature as the real temperature at which all the heat in the steam is 
available. For example, assume the following steam flow to a reboiler:
• 1000 lb/h of 100-psig steam
• 400°F steam inlet temperature
• 300°F condensate outlet temperature
The 100-psig steam condenses at approximately 320°F. The heat 
available from the steam is
• Desuperheating = (400°F - 320°F) × [0.5 Btu/(lb)(°F)] × 
1000 lb/h = 40,000 Btu/h
• Condensing = 900 Btu/lb × 1000 lb/h = 900,000 Btu/h
• Subcooling = (320°F - 300°F) × [1.0 Btu/(lb)(°F)] × 1000 lb/h = 
20,000 Btu/h
• Total reboiler duty = 960,000 Btu/h
This calculation is typical in that 94 percent of the heat is liber-
ated at the 320°F condensing temperature of the saturated steam. 
Another way of stating the same idea is that a steam reboiler depends 
on latent-heat transfer and not on sensible-heat transfer.

12.2  Condensing Heat-Transfer Rates
When a vapor condenses to a liquid, we say that the latent heat of con-
densation of the vapor is liberated. In a steam reboiler, this liberated 
heat is used to reboil the distillation tower. When a vapor, or more com-
monly a liquid, cools, we say that its sensible heat is reduced. For a 
small or slight temperature change, the change in latent heat might be 
large, while the change in sensible heat will be very small.
Heat exchange provided by sensible-heat transfer is improved 
when velocities are higher. Especially when the heating fluid is on the 
tube side of an exchanger, sensible-heat-transfer rates are always 
increased by high velocity.
Heat exchange provided by latent-heat transfer is improved when 
velocities are lower. It is my experience that this loss of heat transfer at 
high velocity is quite large when steam is flowing through the tube side 
of an exchanger. Theoretically, this happens because the condensing film 
of steam is blown off the tube surface by the high vapor velocity.
This improved heat-transfer rate, promoted by low velocity, 
applies not only for condensing steam but also for condensing other 
pure-component vapors. And since condensation rates are favored 
by low velocity, this permits the engineer to design the steam side 
of reboilers and condensers in general for low-pressure drops. For 
example, if we measured the pressure above the channel head pass 
partition baffle shown in Fig. 12.1, we would observe a pressure of 
100 psig. The pressure below the channel head pass partition baffle 
would typically be 99 psig.
12.2.1  Blown Condensate Seal
Figure 12.2 shows a common type of reboiler failure. The steam trap on 
the condensate drain line has stuck open. A steam trap is a device intended 
to open when its float is lifted by water. The steam trap remains open 
until all the water drains out of the trap. Then, when there is no more 
water to keep the trap open, it shuts. But if the float sticks open, steam 
can blow through the steam trap. This is called a blown condensate seal. 
The average vapor velocity through the tubes will then accelerate. If the 
steam trap is passing a lot of steam, the velocity of steam in the tubes 
increases a bit. I have seen this often. Blowing the condensate seal due to 
a faulty steam trap causes a loss in reboiler duty of 50 percent or more. 
This is due to the increased steam tube-side velocity, reducing the rate of 
condensation of the steam, and hence reducing the rate of liberation of 
the latent heat of condensation of the steam.
12.2.2  Condensate Backup
What would happen to a steam reboiler if the float in the steam trap 
became stuck in a partly closed position, or if the steam trap were too 
small? Water—that is, steam condensate—would start to back up into

the channel head of the reboiler, as shown in Fig. 12.3. The bottom 
tubes of the reboiler bundle would become covered with water. The 
number of tubes exposed to the condensing steam would decrease. 
This would reduce the rate of steam condensation and also the 
reboiler heat duty.

141
Meanwhile, the tubes covered with stagnant water would begin  
to cool. The steam condensate submerging these tubes would cool. 
This cooled water would be colder than the saturation temperature of 
the condensing steam. The tubes would then be said to be submerged 
in subcooled water.
We can see, then, that either condensate backup or blowing the 
condensate seal will cause a steam reboiler to lose capacity. If you 
think either of these two problems could cause a loss in reboiler duty, 
try opening the bypass around the steam trap. If the reboiler duty 
goes up, the problem was condensate backup. If the reboiler  
duty goes down, the problem might be a blown condensate seal. If 
it looks like a blown condensate seal problem, close the steam trap 
bypass. Then partially close the valve downstream of the steam 
trap. If this increases the reboiler duty, a blown condensate seal fail-
ure is proved.

12.3  Maintaining System Efficiency
12.3.1  Steam Flow Control
The flow of steam to a reboiler can be controlled by using a control 
valve on either (1) the steam inlet line or (2) the condensate outlet line.
Figure 12.4 shows a control valve on the steam inlet line. The rate of 
steam flow to the reboiler is not really controlled directly, however, by 
this control valve. The actual rate of steam flow to the reboiler is con-
trolled by the rate of condensation of the steam inside the tubes. The 
faster the steam condenses, the faster it flows into the channel head. The 
function of the control valve is to reduce the steam pressure in the chan-
nel head of the reboiler. For example, in case 1, described below:
• 160-psig steam supply header pressure.
• DP across control valve = 60 psi and the control valve is 
40 percent open.
• 100-psig steam pressure, condensing at 320°F, in the channel 
head.
• Shell-side reboiler temperature of 240°F.
• Steam flow = 10,000 lb/h.
• Temperature difference between the condensing steam and 
the boiling process liquid is then (320°F - 240°F) = 80°F. This 
is called the temperature-difference driving force, or DT.
Now the rate or heat duty of steam condensation is termed Q:

where A = surface area of the tubes, which are exposed to the 
condensing steam, ft2
	
U = heat-transfer coefficient—a constant, describing the rate 
of condensation of steam, on those tubes exposed to the 
condensing steam (Btu/[(h)/(ft2)(°F)])
	
DT = temperature difference between the shell and tube sides, °F
	
Q = heat-exchanger duty, Btu/h (for the preceding equation 
in case 1; 10,000,000 Btu/h)
In case 2, the shell-side reboiler temperature rises from 240 to 280°F 
(one reason for such a rise in temperature could be an increase in tower 
pressure). Now DT = (320°F - 280°F) = 40°F. Looking at the equation on 
the previous page, it looks as if Q will drop in half to 5000 lb/h (which 
is about the same as 5,000,000 Btu/h). Thus, the flow of steam to the 
reboiler has been cut in half, even though the control valve position has 
not moved.
You might have noticed how we have used 1,000,000 Btu/h of 
heat interchangeably with 1000 lb/h of steam. This is approximately 
correct for low-pressure steam.
To consider a third case, we wish to maintain the original 240°F 
shell-side temperature, but to increase the steam flow from 10,000 to 
15,000 lb/h. This will force the steam inlet control valve to open. As 
the control valve opens, the pressure in the channel head rises from 
100 psig to the full steam header pressure of 160 psig. At this pres-
sure, steam condenses at 360°F. The new DT is then (360°F - 240°F) = 
120°F. This new temperature driving force is 50 percent greater than 
the first case’s driving force of 80 percent. Hence the rate of steam 
condensation also increases by 50 percent, from 10,000 to 15,000 lb/h.
In case 1, the steam inlet control valve was 40 percent open. In 
case 3, let’s assume that the inlet control valve is 70 percent open. If 
we open the control valve to 100 percent, the steam flow will not 
increase at all. Why? Because once the steam pressure in the channel 
head rises to the steam header pressure, no further increase in steam 
flow is possible, regardless of the position of the inlet control valve.
12.3.2  Condensate Control
Once the steam pressure in the channel head of Fig. 12.4 falls to the 
pressure in the condensate collection header, the steam trap can no 
longer pass condensate. Water will back up in the channel head and 
water-log the lower tubes in the tube bundle. This will lead to unsta-
ble steam flow control. This is especially true if the steam supply 
pressure is less than 20 psig above the condensate collection header 
pressure.
It is better not to use a steam inlet control valve when using low-
pressure steam. The channel head pressure will then always equal the 
steam header supply pressure. The flow of steam to the reboiler can 

	
144	
C h a p t e r  T w e l v e
then be controlled only by raising or lowering the water level in the 
channel head, as shown in Fig. 12.5. This sort of control scheme will 
work perfectly well until the water level drops to the bottom of the 
channel head. If the condensate drain control valve then opens 
further in an attempt to increase steam flow into the reboiler, the 
condensate seal is blown, and the reboiler heat duty drops.
A better design is shown in Fig. 12.6. In this scheme, a condensate 
drum is used to monitor the level in the channel head. As the drum 
level is drawn down, the number of tubes in the reboiler exposed to

the condensing steam is increased. However, when the water level 
drops to the bottom of the channel head, the level sensor in the con-
densate drum assumes control over (i.e., overrides) the condensate 
flow controller and prevents loss of the condensate seal.
One important feature of Fig. 12.6 is the condensate drum balance 
line. Note that this line is connected below the channel head pass par-
tition baffle. This ensures that the pressure in the channel head below 
the pass partition baffle and the pressure in the condensate drum 
are the same. If these two pressures are not identical, the level in the 
condensate drum cannot represent the level in the channel head. For 
this reason, never connect the condensate drum vapor space to either 
the steam supply line or the top vent of the reboiler’s channel head.
12.4  Carbonic Acid Corrosion
Steam produced from demineralized water is largely free of carbon-
ates. Steam produced from lime-softened water will be contaminated 
with carbonates that decompose in the boiler to carbon dioxide. As 
the steam condenses in a reboiler, the CO2 accumulates as a non-
condensable gas. This gas will be trapped mainly below the channel 
head pass partition baffle, shown in Fig. 12.6. As the concentration of 
CO2 increases, the CO2 will be forced to dissolve in the water:
H2O + CO2 = H2CO3 = (H+)(HCO-
3)
That is, carbonic acid will be formed. Carbonic acid is quite cor-
rosive to carbon steel. Reboiler tube leaks, associated with steam-side 
corrosion, are almost certainly due to carbonic acid attack.
Venting the channel head through the balance line shown in Fig. 12.6 
will prevent an excessive accumulation of CO2. This is done by continu-
ous venting from the top of the condensate drum. For every 10,000 lb/h 
of steam flow, vent off 50 lb/h of vapor through a restriction orifice 
placed in the condensate drum vent. This is usually cheaper than con-
trolling reboiler steam-side corrosion with neutralizing chemicals.
Often the problem with CO2 accumulation inside the channel 
head results not so much in corrosion, but in the loss of heat transfer. 
This is due to the tubes below the bottom pass partition baffle filling 
with non-condensable CO2 gas. I have observed this problem even in 
plants using demineralized boiler feedwater. Venting from beneath 
the bottom pass partition baffle will restore heat transfer rates. Vent-
ing above the pass partition baffle or from the top of the channel head 
is futile. Unfortunately, most such channel head vents are installed on 
the top of the channel head, and thus are completely ineffective.
12.4.1  Channel Head Leaks
Varying the steam-to-condensate interface level to control the reboiler 
duty will promote steam leaks in the channel head-to-shell flanged 

	
146	
C h a p t e r  T w e l v e
closure. This is caused by the thermal cycling and stresses that result 
from constantly varying the level of condensate in the channel head. 
However, when low-pressure steam (<60 psig) is used, this becomes 
a minor problem, which may be safely ignored.
When high-pressure steam (>100 psig) is used, rather significant 
leaks of hot condensate and steam can be caused by a variable con-
densate level in the channel head. For such higher-pressure steam 
sources, control of steam flow with condensate backup, as shown in 
Figs. 12.5 and 12.6, is best avoided.
12.5  Condensate Collection Systems
How much steam condensate is your plant recovering? Seventy per-
cent is considered pretty good, and 30 percent is, by any standard, 
pretty awful. As condensate collection flows are rarely metered, here 
is a really good way to make such an overall measurement (ST = 
steam; TR = treated water):
 
1. Determine ST—the lb/h of steam raised in the whole plant.
 
2. Determine TR—the lb/h of softened or demineralized treated 
water flowing to the deaerators.
 
3. The percent of condensate recovery is then
100% - 100% (TR ÷ ST)
Loss of steam condensate to the plant’s sewer is environmen-
tally wrong and wastes money for water-treating chemicals and 
energy. The principal reasons why steam condensate is lost to the 
sewer are
• It creates steam or water hammer in the condensate collection 
system.
• Back-pressure from the condensate collection lines creates 
control difficulties in steam reboilers or heaters.
• The condensate is contaminated with traces of dissolved 
hydrocarbons, phenols, NH3, H2S, etc.
12.5.1  Water Hammer
Steam or water hammer (more properly called hydraulic hammer) is 
one process plant phenomenon familiar to the general public. I well 
remember trying to warm up the steam system of a large amine plant 
in Texas City in 1980, and feeling more than hearing the crescendo of 
crashes due to steam hammer. The cause of steam hammer is illus-
trated in Fig. 12.7.
In general, hydraulic hammer is caused by the sudden conversion 
of the velocity of a liquid into pressure, causing a surge of pressure 

	
S t e a m  a n d  C o n d e n s a t e  S y s t e m s 	
147
inside a piping system. Steam hammer is caused by the creation of 
localized cool areas in piping systems containing saturated steam. 
For example, when first introduced into idled pipes, the steam con-
denses rapidly upon encountering a length of cold piping. This creates 
slugs of water. The continuing rapid but localized condensation of 
steam further downstream creates areas of low pressure or even a 
partial vacuum. The slugs of water rush to these areas of low pres-
sure. Or, more precisely, the pressure differences created by the 
localized condensation of the steam provide a source of energy to 
accelerate water in the steam system. When these rapidly moving 
slugs of water impact an elbow or T-junction, the vibrations and noise 
of steam hammer result.
Introducing condensate from high-pressure steam traps into the 
low-pressure condensate collection system will generate steam. For 
example, passing 1000 lb/h of condensate from a 160-psig reboiler 
into a 20-psig collection system will generate about 100 lb/h of steam. 
More importantly, the volume of flow will increase from 20 ft3/h to 
over 1000 ft3/h, as a result of flash vaporization. If water at, say, 200°F 
from a low-pressure trap enters the piping, then any flashed steam 
will rapidly condense and create an area of low pressure. Slugs of 
water will rush to this low-pressure area, crashing into elbows and 
piping fittings; thus, the origin of steam hammer.
Operators stop steam hammer by dumping either the hot con-
densate (from a high-pressure steam trap) or the colder condensate 
(from a low-pressure steam trap) to the sewer. Either way, the con-
densate is no longer recycled to boiler feedwater. The sort of design 
required to collect condensate without steam hammer is illustrated in 
Fig. 12.8. Basically, hot, high-pressure condensate is collected in a

dedicated system. The flashed steam from this system is recovered as 
low-pressure steam. The resulting water is then passed into the low-
pressure condensate recovery piping system along with water flow-
ing from the low-pressure steam traps.
I was told by an attendee at one of my seminars about the method 
used at his plant in Delhi to suppress steam hammer. A screen that 
looks like a pump suction filter is inserted between pipe flanges. As I 
have never used such a device myself and do not know how to calcu-
late the required hole size or percent of open area of the screen, I have 
not included any further details in this text. My Indian colleague 
noted that this screen retrofit was quite effective in reducing steam 
hammer in this facility.
12.5.2  Condensate Backup in Reboilers
Operators who have problems with loss of reboiler capacity often 
attribute these problems to condensate backup. This is usually true. 
To drop the level of water out of the channel head, either the steam 
trap or the condensate drum is bypassed by putting the condensate to 
the sewer. Sometimes the float of the trap is sticking, but mostly the 
difficulty is an erratically high pressure in the condensate collection 
piping. Our guess is that the engineers who design these collection 
systems do not anticipate the large volume of steam generated from 
flashing, high-pressure condensate.
Condensate pumps are sometimes used to overcome such back-
pressure problems. However, these pumps are often not kept in good 
repair, and condensate is still lost to the sewer. Eliminating the steam 
inlet control valve of the type shown in Fig. 12.4 has helped recover 
condensate from many reboilers supplied with low-pressure steam.

12.5.3  Contaminated Condensate Reuse
Much of the steam consumed in process units comes into direct con-
tact with the process streams. A few examples are
• Steam vacuum jets
• Catalyst lift steam
• Stripping steam
• Vessel purge steam
For corrosion and safety reasons, the condensate recovered from 
these sources is best not returned to the deaerator for use as boiler 
feedwater. 
However, there are no unchangeable rules in the process industry. 
Several years ago, I was working for an asphalt refinery in Corpus 
Christi, Texas. This refinery collected all their contaminated steam con-
densate streams from reflux drums and from a vacuum tower hot-well 
system. Without even steam stripping, the collected condensate was 
recycled back to the steam boiler. It’s true only low-pressure (100-psig) 
steam was generated. It’s true the steam so generated was not used in 
a turbine or in any chemical process. But on the other hand, they had 
been doing this for 20 years without any ill effects.
Had they asked my opinion, I would have told them based on 
38 years of experience that I had never heard of any plant using con-
taminated water to generate steam. Luckily for them, they hadn’t 
asked for my opinion.
Depending on the contaminant, the condensate may be reused 
for a number of services. Our favorite reuse of such contaminated 
condensate is as a replacement for velocity steam in the heater-tube 
passes of a fired furnace.
There is little danger in injecting a controlled amount of water 
into a furnace inlet when using a properly designed metering pump. 
Such pumps typically have a capacity of 1 to 10 GPM and provide a 
set flow regardless of the discharge pressure. The injected water 
flashes immediately to steam inside the furnace tubes. I have retrofit-
ted several vacuum and delayed coker heaters with condensate injec-
tion systems with no adverse downstream effects. Water from the hot 
well of a vacuum ejector system is the normal source of condensate 
for this environmentally friendly modification.
12.6  Deaerators
The humble deaerator, operated by the utility department, is an inter-
esting and important component of any process facility. Oxygen is a 
highly corrosive element and if left in the boiler feedwater would 
rapidly oxidize the boiler’s tubes.

	
150	
C h a p t e r  T w e l v e
The dissolved air left in boiler feedwater (BFW) is stripped out 
with steam in the deaerator shown in Fig. 12.9. The cold BFW has been 
taken first from the Mississippi River and then filtered to remove sand 
and sediment. Removal of the bulk of the calcium salts that would 
cause hardness deposits in the boilers is often accomplished by hot-lime 
softening. If excess CO2 gas appears in downstream units consuming 
the steam, it is the fault of the lime softening, not the deaerator.
Figure 12.9 shows that the cold BFW has been heated to 160°F, 
from the 90°F lime-softener effluent. This is an excellent way to save 
steam to the deaerator. Usually, heating river or well water above 
130°F would cause the laydown of hardness deposits inside the cool-
ing-water tubes (assuming the cooling water to be on the tube side). 
But using softened water as a cooling-water supply permits that 
water to be easily heated to 160°F without fear of precipitating hard-
ness deposits. Thus softened or demineralized cooling water can also 
be used as boiler feedwater, and about 40 percent of the deaerator 
steam requirements are then saved.
Most of the steam supply to a deaerator is used to heat the 160°F 
BFW to 230°F. This is the boiling point of water at 10 psig, which is 
the pressure in the deaerator. The water in the deaerator must always 
be at its boiling point; it is impossible to steam-strip air out of water 
below its boiling-point temperature.
The 160°F BFW is efficiently mixed with the incoming steam in 
what is effectively a small, vertical stripping tower mounted above 
the large deaerator drum. The majority of the steam condenses by

direct contact with the 160°F BFW and in so doing, the latent heat of 
condensation of the steam is used to increase the sensible-heat con-
tent of the 160°F BFW to 230°F.
A small amount of steam is vented from the top of the stripping 
tower to the atmosphere. Using a gate valve, with a hole drilled 
through the gate, is a simple way to control the venting rate. The dis-
solved air in the cold BFW is vented with this steam.
The stripped 230°F BFW drains into the large deaerator drum. 
This drum simply provides residence time for the high-pressure BFW 
pumps, which supply water directly to the boilers. Recovered steam 
condensate, which should be air-free, is fed to this drum through a 
separate nozzle.
12.6.1  Deaerator Flooding
One of the most interesting troubleshooting assignments of my career 
involved a deaerator in New Orleans. The operator reported loss of the 
water level in the deaerator drum. The level-control valve shown in 
Fig. 12.9 would open 100 percent, but this drove the level down even 
faster. The operator reported that the only way he could restore the water 
level would be to mostly close the water makeup level-control valve.
On the surface, this story sounds crazy. But let’s see what hap-
pened. This deaerator had been designed for a much smaller flow of 
160°F BFW and a much larger flow of hot-steam condensate than are 
current operations. The cold BFW feed line had been oversized, but 
the steam line was of marginal size. As the demand for hot BFW 
increased, the cold-BFW level-control valve opened. This reduced the 
temperature and pressure in the deaerator drum. In response, the 
steam pressure-control valve also opened. But when the cold-BFW 
level-control valve was 40 percent open, the steam pressure-control 
valve was 100 percent. Steam flow was now at its maximum.
The pressure inside the deaerator started to drop, as there was not 
enough steam flow to keep the water in the drum at its boiling point. 
The reduction in the deaerator pressure increased the volume of 
steam flow through the bottom tray of the stripping tower. Why?
According to the ideal-gas law:
	
~
Volume
1
pressure
	
This means volume is inversely proportional to pressure. As the 
pressure of the flowing steam declined, the steam’s volume increased. 
The larger volume of steam flow resulted in a higher vapor velocity 
to the stripper trays 1 through 3. This caused the bottom stripper tray 
to flood. After a few minutes, the flooding forced cold BFW out of the 
atmospheric vent. The level in the deaerator drum then fell. The cold 
BFW level-control valve opened further, driving down both the tem-
perature and the pressure in the deaerator drum. The volume and the 

	
152	
C h a p t e r  T w e l v e
velocity of the steam flow to the stripper also increased, and the 
flooding became progressively more severe.
The only way the operator could restore the water level was to 
reverse this process. He manually restricted the flow of cold BFW 
through the level-control valve. This raised the stripper pressure and 
stopped the flooding.
The problem was corrected by increasing the temperature of the 
cold BFW to 190°F. Note that the key to solving this problem was 
observing the loss of water through the atmospheric vent. Some-
times, as far-fetched as an operator’s description of a problem seems, 
it is still correct.
12.7  Surface Condensers
12.7.1  Steam Turbine Surface Condensers
Steam used to drive a turbine can be extracted at an intermediate 
pressure for further use of the low-pressure steam. Rarely is the steam 
vented to the atmosphere, as this wastes steam and the condensate is 
also lost. Many turbines exhaust steam under vacuum to a surface 
condenser. The lower the pressure in the surface condenser, the 
greater the amount of work that can be extracted from each pound of 
steam (see Chap. 24, Steam Turbines).
Discounting the presence of air leaks, the temperature inside the 
surface condenser determines the pressure of the steam exhausting 
from the turbine. This pressure is the vapor pressure of water at the 
surface condenser outlet temperature.
The original steam condensers were barometric condensers, which 
were used to increase the efficiency of the steam-driven reciprocating 
beam engines by a factor of 10. The barometric condenser was 
invented by James Watt (the steam engine was invented by Thomas 
Newcomen). Exhaust steam is mixed directly with cold water. As this 
creates a vacuum, the barometric condenser must be elevated about 
30 ft above grade. The mixed condensate and cooling water drains 
through a pipe called a barometric leg—hence the name barometric 
condenser.
The surface condenser is an improvement on the barometric con-
denser, because it permits recovery of clean steam condensate. Other 
than this factor, the old-fashioned barometric condenser is more effi-
cient than the more modern surface condenser.
Figure 12.10 shows the type of surface condenser most widely 
used on older steam turbines. Note that it has both a vapor and a 
liquid outlet. The turbine is located above the surface condenser. The 
wet exhaust steam flows down into the top of the condenser shell. 
Note that the exhaust steam from an efficient turbine will contain sev-
eral percent of water.

	
S t e a m  a n d  C o n d e n s a t e  S y s t e m s 	
153
The shell-side pressure drop of the surface condenser is quite low. 
The vapor outlet flow consists of air drawn into the system through 
leaks, CO2, and a small amount of uncondensed steam. The weight 
flow of vapor from the top of the condenser is 1 percent or less than 
the flow of condensate from the bottom of the condenser.
The vapor is drawn into a steam jet (discussed in Chap. 23). The 
steam condensate flows into the boot or hot well. The water in the boot 
is slightly subcooled. This is accomplished by a pair of baffles that 
create a small zone of condensate backup. The subcooled condensate, 
cooled to perhaps 10°F below its boiling or bubbling point, is easier to 
pump. As the pressure in the hot well is sub-atmospheric, the hot-
well pump typically develops a DP of at least 30 to 50 psi.
If the hot-well pump cannot handle the required condensate flow, 
the water level in the well will back up. The temperature in the hot 
well will go down as the lower condenser tubes are submerged. But 
this will reduce the surface area of the condenser that is exposed to 
the condensing steam. The condenser outlet temperature will there-
fore rise and so will the surface condenser pressure. This reduces the 
horsepower that can be recovered from each pound of the motive 
steam flowing to the turbine. The turbine will then slow down.
One common error made in monitoring the performance of surface 
condensers is the practice of considering the hot-well temperature as if

it were the true condensing temperature. It is the vapor outlet tempera-
ture that is the real surface condenser temperature. A decrease in the 
hot-well temperature resulting from a high hot-well water level is not 
an indication of improved condenser performance. It is a sign of 
reduced condenser capacity.
12.7.1.1  Air-Cooled Surface Condensers
Figure 12.11 shows a surface condenser elevated above the steam tur-
bine. This creates an additional problem, in that moisture from the 
turbine exhaust steam will accumulate in the bottom of the turbine 
case. A special drain line from the turbine’s case is needed to prevent 
condensate backup from damaging the spinning wheels.
One such turbine in a refinery near London would not drain 
properly. In order to push the condensate out of the turbine case, the 
operators were forced to raise the surface condenser pressure from 
100 to 250 mm Hg (i.e., 20 inches of mercury vacuum, in the American 
system). Note that the balance line shown in Fig. 12.11 keeps the 
pressure in the turbine case and the condensate drum, into which the 
turbine case is draining, the same.

The turbine case pressure was increased by raising the pressure in 
the air-cooled surface condenser. This was accomplished by shutting 
off several of the air fans, which, in turn, increased the condensing 
temperature of the exhaust steam. But why would raising the turbine 
case pressure drain the turbine anyway? After all, increasing the sur-
face condenser pressure also increased the pressure in the drum that 
the turbine case drained to.
The answer is revealed when the available data are converted to 
consistent units. The 250 mm Hg turbine case pressure is equal to a 
height of water of 11 ft. Atmospheric pressure in London was 14.5 psia 
that day, which is equal to 33 ft of water. The difference between 
atmospheric pressure and the pressure in the turbine case, expressed 
in feet of water, is then
(33 ft - 11 ft) = 22 ft
This turned out to be the exact elevation difference between the 
water level in the turbine case and the only flange on the drain line, 
from the turbine case to the drum below. This flange was found to be 
leaking. If the water head pressure at the flange became less than 
atmospheric pressure, then air was forced into the drain line. The 
bubbles of air expanded as they floated up the drain line into the 
turbine case. This prevented the water from draining freely through 
the drain line into the drum. Only by raising the turbine case pressure 
to pressure-up the flange to match atmospheric pressure could this 
air leak be stopped.
The flange leak was taped over, and the exhaust-steam pressure 
dropped back to 100 mm Hg. The steam required to drive the turbine 
fell by 18 percent. This incident is technically quite similar to losing 
the downcomer seal on a distillation tower tray. Again, it illustrates 
the sort of field observations one needs to combine with basic techni-
cal calculations. This is the optimum way to attack and solve process 
problems.

Vapor Lock and 
Exchanger Flooding 
in Steam Systems
T
he interaction of a steam reboiler with its condensate collection 
system can be very simple or very complex. Simple in the sense 
that the plant operators are satisfied to drain the steam conden-
sate to the sewer from the channel head of the steam reboiler or feed 
preheater. Complex if the operators are trying to route the condensate 
back to the steam generation (boiler house) for recovery and reuse. 
In many refineries, the ratio of fresh BFW (boiler feedwater) to 
steam generation is so high (70–80 percent) that one has to wonder, 
what has happened to most of the steam condensate? Mainly, due to 
design errors, the plant operators have been forced to divert the con-
densate to the sewer. 
13.1  Function of the Steam Trap
The purpose of the steam trap, as shown in Fig. 13.1, is twofold: 
	
1.	 To preserve the condensate seal. If steam blows through the 
outlet drain nozzle on the channel head, the rate of heat transfer 
will drop dramatically.
	
2.	 To minimize condensate backup. If condensate fills up tubes, 
then those tubes are unavailable to condense steam. Thus, the 
rate of heat transfer will drop in proportion to the tubes filled 
with water.
The steam trap is designed to pass liquids (H2O) and retard the 
passage of vapor (steam).
There are two problems with the use of the control scheme shown 
in Fig. 13.1. First, steam traps are mechanically unreliable. Second, as 
valve A closes, the pressure in the lower half of the channel head may 
briefly fall below the frequently unstable pressure in the condensate 
157

C h a p t e r  T h i r t e e n
collection header pipe. When this happens, water in the condensate 
header could flow backwards into the channel head of the reboiler 
and rapidly submerge many of the tubes.
I would ignore this problem if the steam pressure is 100 psig or 
more and the condensate collection header is 30 psig or less. For 
smaller steam flows, 5000 to 10,000 lb/hr, I would use a steam trap. 
For larger steam flows, I would use a condensate pot and level control 
valve (LRC), as discussed in a following section.
The steam trap neither aids nor retards condensate drainage, 
unless it is mechanically malfunctioning, meaning it is sticking either 
open or closed. Also, replacing the steam trap with a condensate drum 
and LRC also neither retards nor aids drainage. Condensate drainage 
is a function of system hydraulics, as discussed in subsequent sections.
13.2  Non-condensable Venting
There is always a small amount of CO2 in steam. It originates from 
residual carbonates in the BFW. Compared to steam, the CO2 is a non-
condensable with a limited solubility in H2O. As the steam condenses, 
the few ppm of CO2 will be trapped on the steam side of the tube 
bundle inside the channel head. However, none of the CO2 will be 
trapped above the pass partition baffle shown in Fig. 13.1. And all of 
the CO2 will be trapped below the pass partition baffle. Therefore, the 
problem is that, venting from valve C in Fig. 13.1 will vent off steam, 
but no CO2. To purge the accumulated CO2 from the tube bundle, 
vent valve B must be used.

159
If this non-condensable is not removed from the channel head, 
then my clients have observed (over a period of days, not hours) a 
progressive loss in heat transfer capacity. The proof that this is a 
buildup of non-condensables is that briefly blowing the condensate 
seal restores heat transfer capacity. The CO2 increases the tube-side 
heat transfer film resistance, rather similar to a temporary fouling 
deposit. I call this vapor binding.
In 1983, I was told by a Shell engineer that their standard is to 
continuously vent 0.5 percent of the steam through a restriction ori-
fice to purge CO2. I still follow this practice, even though I suspect 
that just a small fraction of this rate of venting is required, if the steam 
is produced from demineralized water.
13.3  Corrosive Steam
If CO2 is not vented off from valve B, then it will begin to dissolve in 
the condensate to form H2CO3 (carbonic acid). This acid causes tube 
failures due to acidic corrosion. Venting gas below the pass partition 
baffle will stop this corrosion, according to the Shell expert. I don’t 
have any personal experience in stopping CO2 corrosion with such 
venting. But it seems to make good engineering sense to me.
13.4  Condensate Drum
There is no process reason to use the condensate drum shown in 
Fig. 13.2 rather than a steam trap. In a modern refinery with large 
steam flows, the convention is to design systems with condensate

drums for mechanical reliability. The balance line shown is required 
to maintain steam pressure in the condensate collection drum. The 
natural tendency is to maximize the drum pressure to promote con-
densate drainage from the drum by keeping valve C open and B 
closed. Then the pressure in the condensate drum would be 40 psig. 
But the pressure in the lower half on the channel head would only 
be 35 psig. (I’ve assumed a 5 psi ΔP on the steam side.) How can 
water at a pressure of 35 psig flow into a vessel at 40 psig?
The only possibility is condensate backup equivalent to 5 psi:
(5 psi) ¥ (2.3 ft/psi) = 11½ ft
Which is ridiculous, as the reboiler is only 5 ft in diameter. Even a 
1 psi ΔP would submerge half the tubes with water. The operators 
will respond to this design error by draining the channel head directly 
to the sewer. Thus, the correct balance line connection location to use 
is through valve B, and never valve C. That is, leave C closed and B 
open. I learned about this from Sandy Lani.
13.5  Condensate Drainage and Vapor Lock
As steam condensate flows through process piping, it loses pressure 
due to frictional losses. Alternately, condensate draining from a 
reboiler outlet nozzle will accelerate and lose pressure according to 
the following formula:
Pressure drop (psi) = (0.015)(V2)
where V = feet per second
For example, condensate draining through a nozzle at 10 ft per sec-
ond would undergo a ΔP of 1½ psi. As the condensate is presumed to 
be draining out of the reboiler at its saturated liquid temperature (or 
boiling point or bubble point) as it loses the 1½ psi, you might think it 
would have a tendency to partially vaporize to steam. But this is not 
the case.
Let’s say I have 100-psig steam condensing to water at its saturated 
liquid temperature of 320°F. If 1 cubic foot (about 59 lb) of this water is 
turned into steam, it will expand to approximately 150 cubic feet. The 
resulting increase in velocity will exponentially increase the pressure 
drop, which will largely choke off the flow. This is called vapor lock. 
To the operators, it appears as if a valve has been partially closed in 
the drain line. Depending on the line velocity and length, the flow 
will be reduced a lot or a little. For a short, oversized line, the effect 
may be minimal. But for a line sized for flowing water only, at a 
design velocity of 8 or 12 ft per second for a length of several hun-
dred feet, the effect will be extremely large.

13.5.1  Effect of Vapor Lock
The consequences of vapor lock on the performance of a vertical thermo-
syphon steam reboiler, with steam on the shell side, is shown in Fig. 13.3.
The boiling point temperature of 60-psig water is about 270°F. 
The condensation temperature of 100-psig steam is about 320°F. As 
the condensate flows out of the shell side of the reboiler, it loses:
• Two psi through the nozzle.
• Plus 38 psi through the condensate drain line.
To suppress the evolution of steam in the drain line, the conden-
sate must be subcooled from 320°F to 270°F as it leaves the reboiler. 
This can only be accomplished by condensate backup. And if the con-
densate is not subcooled to 270°F, then the condensate will begin to 
vaporize. Which will then:
	 A.	 Choke off the flow.
	
B.	 Back up the shell-side water level.

	 C.	 Cause the condensate to be subcooled, so that when it falls to 
60 psig, it is cold enough so that it does not flash and vapor 
lock is suppressed.
The problem with condensate backup and subcooling is the 
very low heat transfer coefficient (U) for subcooling vs. condensation. 
Typical heat transfer coefficients (Btu/hr/ft2/°F) are:
• Steam condensation = 400 to 600
• Subcooling = 20 to 40
To condense a pound of 100 psig steam requires 920 Btu of heat 
removal. To subcool water from 320°F to 270°F requires 50 Btu of heat 
removal. The reader can conclude from the above that around half of 
the surface area of the reboiler in Fig. 13.3 is devoted to subcooling, 
but only for 5 percent of the reboiler duty [i.e., 50 ÷ (920 + 50) =  
5 percent].
13.5.2  Design Options to Mitigate Vapor Lock
• Option One—Double the surface area of the reboiler.
• Option Two—Increase the size of the condensate drain line 
by an order of magnitude. I have actually done this and it 
worked. However, in general, this is not a cost-effective 
option for longer condensate collection drain lines.
• Option Three—Inject cold water into the condensate run-
down to suppress vaporization. To suppress vaporization of 
320°F condensate, as shown in Fig. 13.3, enough 70°F water 
(i.e., 25 percent of the condensate flow rate) would have to be 
injected. I have done this as well, with good results.
• Option Four—Drain condensate to the sewer beneath the 
reboiler. This unfortunate option is, by far, the most usual 
solution.
• Option Five—Install a condensate pump and condensate 
drum. Pump the condensate out under level control. The drum 
must be immediately next to and underneath the reboiler. 
Also, the drum must be high enough above the new conden-
sate pump to provide sufficient net positive suction head 
(NPSH) for the pump. This is, of course, the preferred, if not 
the typical way of handling this very common design problem.
13.6  Elevated Condensate Collection Drum
Figure 13.4 illustrates a condensate drum that is elevated above the 
reboiler steam trap. For simplicity, let’s assume that 15 psi of pres-
sure (i.e., 1 atmosphere) equates to 35 ft of hot water head pressure.

Note that the steam supply pressure is 150 psig with a saturation 
temperature of 360°F.
Assume that the condensate drains from the reboiler as saturated 
water (150 psig and 360°F). The ΔP through the steam trap is zero. 
The hot water will lose 70 ft or 30 psig of pressure as it rises up to the 
drum, which operates at only 60 psig. The excess ΔP above the mini-
mum required is then:
150 - 30 - 60 = 60 psi
Thus, superficially, it appears as if the condensate could easily 
flow up into the drum. But it will not.
The problem is that the condensate rising from the steam trap will 
begin to lose pressure due to the gain in elevation. As it rises above the 
reboiler level, the hot saturated water will start to flash, undergo vapor 
lock as described above, and thus choke off the flow. The condensate 
will back up in the channel head of the reboiler shown in Fig. 13.4 and 
become subcooled enough to suppress steam evolution until the con-
densate enters the drum. The required subcooling may easily floods 
half or more of the surface area of the reboiler. The loss of reboiler

capacity typically will not be tolerated by the plant operators, who will 
then be forced to drain the valuable steam condensate to the sewer.
I once had this problem on a debutanizer reboiler and decided to 
add a parallel steam trap. Needless to say, it did not help at all. But 
everyone has to learn from their own mistakes. Injecting cold water at 
the base of the riser did alleviate the problem.
13.7  Conclusion
The design of a steam condensate collection system is a complex task. 
It cannot be approached just as a problem in hydraulics, because it is 
also a problem in vapor-liquid equilibrium and in the conversion of 
sensible heat to latent heat. Considering these three factors together 
requires quite complex calculations, for which I have had to rely on 
the use of a computer model. These same sorts of considerations 
apply to multicomponent hydrocarbon systems, such as propane-
butane refrigeration loops, but then the calculation complexity 
increases by an order of magnitude.

CHAPTER  14
Bubble Point and 
Dew Point
Equilibrium Concepts in 
Vapor-Liquid Mixtures
Our work as process engineers and operators is based on three 
principles: 
• Hydraulics—when the velocity of water in a pipe goes up, its 
pressure goes down.
• Heat balance—condensing steam gives up latent heat, or sensible 
heat, to increase the temperature in the feed preheater.
• Vapor-liquid equilibrium—a boiling liquid is at its bubble point, 
and a condensing vapor is at its dew point.
14.1  Bubble Point
The purpose of this chapter is to explain what is meant by the terms bub-
ble point and dew point, and how we can use these ideas to improve the 
operation of the distillation tower. To begin, we will derive the bubble-
point equation from the basic statement of vapor-liquid equilibrium:
	
y1 = K1 × x1	
 (14.1)
where	 y1 = concentration of the first component in the vapor
	
x1 = concentration of the first component in the liquid
	
K1 = an equilibrium constant
We really should use mole fraction, and not concentration, in our 
description of y and x, but for our work, we will just say that the term 
concentration refers to the percent of a component that the operator 
would see in the gas-chromatographic (GC) results, as reported by 
165

is defined as

 (14.2)
where PV ,1 = vapor pressure of the first component, at the temperature 
we are working at, in psia (see Fig. 14.1 for a chart of 
vapor pressures used here)
	
 PT = total pressure in psia (psia = psig + 14.7)
If you do not recall the meanings of mole fraction or the ideal-gas law, 
don’t worry—it is not necessary to recall these in order to understand bub-
ble points, or dew points. Substituting Eq. (14.2) into Eq. (14.1), we obtain

But if we add up the concentration of the three components in the 
vapor phase on the left side of Eq. (14.4), we would get 100 percent.

Recalling that 100 percent of anything is the whole thing or, in 
other words, equals unity or one, if we cross-multiply both sides of 
this equation by PT , we have
	
PT = PV,1 x1 + PV,2 x2 + PV,3 x3	
 (14.6)
This is the bubble-point equation for a three-component system.
14.1.1  Using the Bubble-Point Equation
Are we missing the pressure PT in the flash drum shown in Fig. 14.2? 
Let’s calculate this pressure, using the bubble-point equation and the 
vapor pressure chart shown in Fig. 14.1:

The term partial pressure, meaning part of the total pressure cre-
ated by each component, is important. The partial pressure of a 
component divided by the total pressure is the concentration of the 
component in the vapor phase. For example, the concentration of 
propane in the vapor leaving the drum shown in Fig. 14.2 is

What is the concentration of pentane in the vapor? (Answer: 
14 ÷ 122 = 11.5 percent.)
14.1.2  Adjusting Temperature to Meet 
a Product Specification
Let us assume that a new set of product specifications has just been 
issued to your shift. The liquid from the flash drum shown in Fig. 14.3 
has too much propane. The new liquid specification is
• Propane: 10 percent
• Butane: 40 percent
• Pentane: 50 percent
The pressure in the drum is still fixed at 122 psia. So, it seems 
as if we will have to run the drum hotter. But how much hotter?

Suppose we raise the drum temperature to 160°F and repeat our

Apparently, our guess of 160°F was wrong. If we had guessed the 
correct temperature, the calculated vessel pressure would have been 
122 psia, not the 110 psia. Try to work this problem yourself by guess-
ing a new flash drum temperature (answer: 168°F).
This seems to be a potentially good application for computer 
technology. For example, an operator is running a debutanizer and 
finds that she has too much isobutane in her isopentane bottoms 
product. She enters the most recent gas chrome result from the lab in 
the computer, with the corresponding tower pressure and reboiler 
outlet temperature. Next, she enters the isobutane specification she 
would like to achieve in the tower’s bottoms product. The computer 
then tells her to raise the reboiler outlet temperature by 17°F to get 
back on spec (specification) quickly. This is a lot better than guessing 
at the reboiler temperature, lining out the tower, and waiting half the 
shift for the lab GC result before making your next move.
14.2  Dew Point
14.2.1  Dew-Point Calculations
We will now derive the dew-point equation from the same basic state-
ment of vapor-liquid equilibrium, starting with Eq. (14.3) in the previ-

14.2.2  Using the Dew-Point Equation
Is science really this easy? Much of the science applied to process 
engineering is straightforward. In order to show you how to calculate 
the temperature of the vapor leaving the depropanizer in Fig. 14.4, 
we will use the dew-point equation.
This time, we know that the tower-top pressure is 175 psig, or 
190 psia. We also know that the composition of the overhead vapor is
• Propane: 80 percent
• Butane: 15 percent
• Pentane: 5 percent
80% propane
15% butane
5% pentane

It is normal to assume that the vapor leaving the top of a tower is 
at its dew point. That is, it is at equilibrium with the liquid on the top 
tray of the tower. Unfortunately, this assumption falls apart if the 
tower is flooding and liquid is being entrained overhead from the 
column with the vapor. However, assuming a normal, nonflooded 
condition, we will guess that the tower-top temperature is 140°F. 
Using the vapor-pressure curves provided in Fig. 14.1, we would cal-
culate as follows:

According to Eq. (14.9), the sum of the quotient of y ÷ PV ought to 
equal 1/PT:
	
=
0.00600
1
PT
	
Solving for PT, we find the calculated tower-top pressure 
equals 167 psia. But the actual tower-top pressure is 190 psia. Evi-
dently, we guessed too low a temperature. Try the calculation 
again yourself with a better guess for the tower-top temperature 
(answer: 146°F).
For this tower, the composition of the overhead vapor is the same 
as the overhead liquid product made from the reflux accumulator.
14.2.3  Revised Product Specification
It seems that the depropanizer overhead composition specification 
has been changed. Our new operating orders are to produce
• Propane: 90 percent
• Butane: 8 percent
• Pentane: 2 percent
The tower-top pressure is still 190 psia. The tower-top tempera-
ture will have to be reduced. Let’s guess that it will be reduced  
to 130°F:

	
172	
C h a p t e r  F o u r t e e n
Referring again to Eq. (14.9), we can solve for PT, the tower pressure:
	
=
0.00510

PT
	
or PT = 196 psia. But this is the calculated tower pressure. The actual 
tower pressure is only 190 psia. Try to repeat this calculation to get 
the correct tower-top temperature (answer: 128°F).
Again, this seems to be a rather nice application for computer  
technology. Even a good-quality programmable calculator can store  
a number of vapor-pressure curves. At least for hydrocarbons, equa-
tions for these curves can be extracted from the API (American Petro-
leum Institute) data book. Also, a programmable calculator can perform 
bubble-point and dew-point calculations, with over 10 components, 
without difficulty.
Dear reader, if you have skipped most of this chapter because of 
the equations and the math, please consider the following:
• Most graduate chemical engineers cannot do these calcula-
tions without the aid of a computer.
• Imagine the pleasure you will get if you’re an operator 
explaining how to execute bubble-point and dew-point calcu-
lations to your unit engineer. Possibly you might observe, 
“Didn’t they teach you this in your first year of chemical engi-
neering at the university?”
• If you are a chemical engineer, you will have to admit that we 
all learned the rules of vapor-liquid equilibrium during our 
freshman year.
For me, it’s easy to remember how to do bubble-point and dew-
point calculations. I carry a pocket-size vapor pressure chart in my 
wallet. When I’m out in the plant troubleshooting, that’s all I need to 
check temperatures versus pressures for light hydrocarbon systems.

Steam Strippers
Source of Latent Heat of Vaporization
T
he use of steam to remove lower-boiling or lighter components 
from a liquid is one of the oldest methods of distillation. Some-
times called steam distillation, this technique relies on a combi-
nation of two simple effects. 
15.1  Heat of Evaporation
The first effect is illustrated when we blow across a bowl of hot 
soup to cool the soup. Our breath displaces the steam vapors that 
are on top of the soup. This encourages more molecules of steam 
vapors to escape from the soup; that is, the vapor pressure of the 
steam above the liquid soup is diminished, because steam is pushed 
out of the soup bowl with air. The correct technical way to express 
this idea is to say, “The partial pressure of the steam, in equilibrium 
with the soup, is diminished.”
But our breath itself does not remove heat from the soup. The 
evaporation of steam from the soup, promoted by our breath, takes 
heat. Converting one pound of soup to one pound of steam requires 
1000 Btu. This heat of evaporation comes not from our breath, but 
from the soup itself. The correct technical way to express this second 
effect is, “The sensible-heat content of the soup is converted to latent 
heat of evaporation.”
15.1.1  Example Calculations
For example, if we have 101 lb of soup in a rather large bowl, and 
cause one pound to evaporate by blowing across the bowl, the soup 
will lose 1000 Btu. This heat of evaporation will come at the expense 
of the temperature of the remaining soup in the bowl; that is, each 
pound of soup will lose 10 Btu. If the specific heat of our soup is 
1.0 Btu/[(lb)(°F)], the soup will cool off by 10°F.
A steam stripper, as shown in Fig. 15.1, works in the same way. The 
diesel-oil product drawn from the fractionator column is contaminated 
173

	
174	
C h a p t e r  F i f t e e n
with gasoline. The stripping steam mixes with the diesel-oil product on 
the trays inside the stripper tower. The steam reduces the hydrocarbon 
partial pressure and thus allows more gasoline to vaporize and to 
escape from the liquid phase into the vapor phase. The heat of vapori-
zation of the gasoline cannot come from the steam, because the steam 
(at 300°F) is colder than the diesel oil (at 500°F). The heat of vaporiza-
tion must come from the diesel-oil product itself.
We can use this idea to calculate the percent of diesel oil that 
would actually vaporize across the stripping trays in the stripping 
tower. Let’s assume the following thermal properties for a typical 
hydrocarbon mixture of diesel and gasoline:
• 0.60 Btu/[(lb)(°F)] is the specific heat.
• 100 Btu/lb is the latent heat.
Referring to Fig. 15.1, the reduction in sensible heat of the diesel 
product equals
(500°F - 475°F) × 0.60 = 15 Btu/lb

The percent of the feed to the stripper that evaporates is then
(15 Btu/lb) ÷ 100 Btu/lb = 15%
15.1.2  Measuring Evaporation in the Field
Note that we have neglected the heat picked up by the steam in the 
preceding calculation. Often, the steam flow is quite small compared 
to the stripper feed, so usually this effect may be disregarded. Unfor-
tunately, we seldom should neglect ambient-heat losses.
Certainly, if the stripper tower and associated piping are radiat-
ing heat from the product, this is not contributing to stripping. To 
determine the temperature drop due to ambient-heat losses, proceed 
as follows:
	
1.	 Check the temperature of the stripper feed.
	
2.	 Shut off the stripping steam and wait 20 min.
	
3.	 Check the temperature of the stripper bottoms product.
The difference between the two temperatures represents the 
ambient-heat loss associated with the stripper. Of course, with no 
ambient-heat loss, this temperature difference would be zero.
15.2  Stripper Efficiency
Many side-stream steam strippers of the type shown in Fig. 15.1 do 
not work very well. Operating personnel report that the stripping 
steam is not effective in removing undesirable lighter components 
from the stripper feed. Why could this be so?
One of the main reasons for this sort of poor stripping efficiency 
is subcooled liquid feed to the stripper. Liquid drawn from any tower 
or vessel is assumed to be in equilibrium with the vapor phase in the 
tower or vessel. We say that the liquid is at its bubble point or boiling 
point. We say that the vapor in the vessel is at its dew point or satura-
tion temperature.
When steam is mixed with a liquid at its bubble point, the partial 
pressure of the vapor in contact with the liquid is reduced. The liquid 
then begins to boil. The lighter components of the liquid are turned 
into vapor and are carried out of the stripper with the steam.
If liquid drawn from a column cools below its bubble point as a 
result of ambient-heat loss, we say it is subcooled. Mixing a small 
amount of steam with subcooled liquid will reduce the partial pres-
sure of any vapor in contact with the liquid, but not enough to pro-
mote boiling. Eventually, as more and more steam is mixed with a 
subcooled liquid, it will begin to boil. But for a given amount of 
steam, the amount of vapor that can be boiled out of a liquid will 

	
176	
C h a p t e r  F i f t e e n
always be less if the liquid is subcooled. In this way, ambient-heat 
loss reduces the stripping efficiency of steam.
Wet steam will also reduce stripping efficiency. The water in the 
steam will be turned into steam when it contacts the hot diesel oil in the 
stripper, shown in Fig. 15.1. The heat of vaporization for this water must 
come from the sensible heat of the diesel. This reduces the temperature 
of the diesel, which also reduces its vapor pressure, which then makes it 
more difficult to vaporize its lighter gasoline components.
I was once working in a refinery that could not meet the flash-
point specification for its diesel product. Flash point is the tempera-
ture at which a hydrocarbon will ignite when exposed to an open 
flame. To raise the flash point of diesel oil, it is steam-stripped to 
remove the lighter, more combustible components. I noticed that I 
could drain water from the bottom of the steam supply line to the 
diesel-oil stripper. I then screwed a steam trap onto the 0.75-inch drain 
valve on the steam supply line. The stripper bottoms temperature 
increased by 35°F, and the flash temperature of the diesel product 
increased from 120 to 175°F.
High liquid levels in the bottom of the stripper will also reduce 
stripping efficiency. A liquid level above the steam inlet will cause the 
stripping trays to flood. Flooding vastly decreases tray efficiency and 
hence stripping efficiency.
As discussed in Chap. 4, tray deck dumping also greatly reduces 
tray efficiency. Unfortunately, steam strippers can have widely vary-
ing vapor rates between the top and bottom trays of a column.
15.2.1  Vapor Distribution in Steam Strippers
Figure 15.2 shows the type of hydrocarbon stripper discussed above. 
Note that the vapor load to the bottom tray is only the 3000 lb/h of 
stripping steam. The vapor load from the top tray is 15,000 lb/h. In 
other words, the vapor leaving the top tray of the stripper consists of 
3000 lb/h of stripping steam plus 12,000 lb/h of hydrocarbon vapor.
From the designer’s point of view, the top tray of the stripper 
should have several times more sieve holes or valve caps on its tray 
deck than the bottom tray. If, however, all the trays in the stripper are 
identical, then either the bottom tray will leak (see Chap. 4) or the top 
tray will flood. Either way, stripping efficiency will suffer.
15.2.2  Steam Stripping Water
So far, we have been discussing the stripping of hydrocarbons. But of 
equal importance is steam stripping of aqueous streams such as
• Removing benzene from seawater
• Removing ammonia from sour water
• Removing hydrogen sulfide from amine solutions

	
S t e a m  S t r i p p e r s 	
177
• Removing methanol from washwater
• Removing oxygen from boiler feedwater in deaerators
Figure 15.3 shows a simple sour-water stripper. The steam is used 
to remove NH3 and H2S, dissolved in the waste, or sour water. In the 
diesel-oil stripper discussed in Sec. 15.2, all the stripping steam went 
out the top of the stripper. But what happens to the stripping steam 
in a water stripper? It is used in four ways:
	
1.	 A large portion of the stripping steam is used to heat the 
wastewater feed, shown in Fig. 15.3, from 180 to 230°F. 
Almost all of this heat comes from the latent of condensation 
of the stripping steam, and very little of this heat comes from 
the temperature (or the sensible-heat content) of the stripping 
steam. This means that the wastewater is heated by 50°F by 
condensing steam inside the stripper.
	
2.	 A portion of the stripping steam is used to break the chemical 
bond between the water and the H2S and NH3 in the 
wastewater. When these gases first dissolved in the water, heat

was evolved or released. This is called the heat of solution. When 
these same gases are driven out of the wastewater with the 
stripping steam, this same heat of solution has to be supplied. 
Again, this heat comes from condensing the stripping steam in 
the water flowing across the trays in the tower.
	
3.	 Some of the stripping steam condenses in the overhead con-
denser, shown in Fig. 15.3. The condensed steam, which accu-
mulates in the reflux drum, is totally refluxed back to the top 
tray of the stripper tower.
	
4.	 A small amount of the stripping steam remains as steam and 
leaves the reflux drum with the H2S and NH3 vapor product.

From this distribution of the stripping steam, we can conclude that 
the pounds of vapor to the bottom tray are much larger than the 
pounds of vapor leaving the top tray. This is just the opposite of the 
diesel-oil stripper.
15.2.3  Temperature Distribution in Water Strippers
The 230°F stripper bottom temperature, shown in Fig. 15.3, is simply 
the boiling point of water at the 10-psig tower-bottom pressure. Small 
amounts of extraneous chemicals (phenol, alcohols, aromatics) dis-
solved in the stripped water do not change the boiling-point tem-
perature of this water.
The 200°F stripper tower-top temperature is the dew point of the 
vapors leaving the top tray. Most of these vapors are steam, and that 
is why the tower-top temperature is so high. The high steam content 
of the overhead vapors cause a water stripper to behave in a strange 
way! When the top reflux rate is increased, the tower-top tempera-
ture goes up, not down. This odd behavior is easily understood if we 
note that there is no liquid product made from the reflux drum. 
Therefore, the only way to increase the reflux rate without losing the 
level in the reflux drum is to increase the steam rate to the bottom 
of the stripper. The extra stripping steam drives up the tower-top 
temperature.
The 140°F reflux drum temperature, shown in Fig. 15.3, is the dew 
point of the vapors leaving the reflux drum. Almost always, we 
would like to minimize this particular temperature. The lower the 
reflux drum temperature, the smaller the amount of steam in the off-
gas. If the off-gas is H2S and NH3 flowing to a sulfur recovery plant, 
the steam carried into the sulfur plant reduces the sulfur plant’s 
capacity and efficiency.
On the other hand, a low reflux drum temperature increases the 
solubility of H2S and NH3 in the reflux water. As the concentration of 
H2S and NH3 in the reflux increases, the stripper has to work harder 
to keep these components out of the stripped water.1
15.2.4  Reboiled Water Strippers
Many water strippers are initially designed with steam reboilers, 
rather than with open stripping steam. The amount of steam required 
is the same in either case. The great advantage of the reboiled stripper 
is that the steam condensate is recovered and recycled back to the 
boilers. When open stripping steam is used, the steam condensate is 
added to the stripped water, thus increasing the plant’s water efflu-
ent. Hence, the use of open stripping steam is environmentally 
unfriendly.
Fouling is the main reason for abandoning many stripper reboil-
ers and substituting open stripping steam. It is easy to pipe up steam

to the stripper. It is difficult to determine and control the cause of the 
fouling in the reboiler. But not to find and control the cause of the 
fouling is sloppy engineering and poor operation.
15.2.5  Stripping Aromatics from Wastewater
Removing benzene and other aromatic compounds from a plant’s 
effluent water is an increasingly common environmental require-
ment. This is typically achieved with a steam stripper. There is a 
rather neat trick, which can increase the stripper’s efficiency: adding 
saltwater to the stripper feed. Aromatics, especially benzene, are far 
less soluble in brine than they are in freshwater. But, of course, the 
brine will be more corrosive than salt-free freshwater.2
15.2.6  Side-Stream Stripper Hydraulics
One of my first successful projects as a young engineer was to 
improve the quality of jet fuel from a side-stream stripper. Initially, I 
had thought the problem was due to poor stripping efficiency, but it 
was really a simple problem in hydraulics: the part of technology that 
deals with the pressure drop of gases and liquids flowing through 
pipes and other process equipment. Liquid heads, gravity, and friction 
are all parts of hydraulics.
The particular problem I encountered is illustrated in Fig. 15.4. 
The jet fuel product was steam-stripped to remove a lighter naphtha 
con­taminant. But much naphtha was left in the jet fuel. Apparently, 
the packing in the stripper tower was not working properly. How-
ever, a discussion with the unit operator indicated that they were 
using very little stripping steam. Introduction of a normal amount of 
steam resulted in a loss of liquid level in the bottom of the stripper.
The pressure at point A in Fig. 15.4 was 13 psig. This means that 
the pressure drop in the vapor line from the stripper back to the 
fractionator was 3 psig. In order for the unstripped jet fuel to flow out 
of the lower-pressure fractionator and into the higher-pressure 
stripper, it had to overcome this 3-psig pressure difference. The 16-ft 
elevation difference between the draw-off nozzle on the fractionator 
and the stripper inlet provided the necessary liquid head driving force.
Let us assume that the specific gravity of the unstripped jet fuel 
was 0.59. Also, note that for water, which has a specific gravity of 1.0:
1.0 psi of pressure = 2.31 ft of water
This means that the pressure head of a column of water 2.31 ft high 
equals 1 psig. The height of a column of unstripped jet fuel equal to a 
pressure head of 1 psig is then

The pressure head of the column of unstripped jet fuel 16 ft high, 
shown in Fig. 15.4, is
16 ft ÷ 4 ft/psi = 4 psi
This means that there was a 4-psi pressure head driving force available 
to overcome the 3-psi pressure drop of the stripper’s overhead vapor 
line. This was sufficient for the jet fuel to flow out of the fractionator 
and into the stripper.
Raising the steam flow to the stripper increased the pressure drop 
in the overhead vapor line from 3 to 5 psi. The pressure at point A in 
Fig. 15.4 then increased from 13 to 15 psig. The 4-psi pressure head 
driving force was not sufficient to overcome the 5-psi pressure drop 
of the stripper’s overhead vapor line. The unstripped jet fuel could

no longer flow out of the fractionator and into the stripper, and the 
liquid level in the stripper was lost.
To correct this problem, I designed a larger-diameter vapor line 
connecting the stripper to the fractionator. Pressure drop through 
piping varies as follows:

Changing the vapor line from a 3-in. pipe to a 4-inch pipe reduced 
the line’s pressure drop from 3 to 0.7 psi. This permitted the stripping 
steam flow to be increased to the stripper, without impeding the jet 
fuel flow from the fractionator. The higher stripping steam flow effi-
ciently removed the contaminant naphtha from the jet fuel product.
15.2.7  Liquid-Line DP
The liquid head driving force of 16 ft, or 4 psi, shown in Fig. 15.4, is 
actually not all available to overcome the higher stripper pressure. 
The frictional loss of the piping used to feed the stripper should be 
subtracted from the liquid head driving force. In the jet fuel example 
presented in Sec. 15.2.6, this frictional loss was neglected.
Sometimes the cheapest way to correct a hydraulic problem on a 
side-stream stripper is to pump the product into the stripper. I have 
modified several plants in this way with excellent results. But leaving 
the pressure in the stripper high will reduce stripping efficiency.

CHAPTER 16
Draw-Off Nozzle 
Hydraulics
Nozzle Cavitation Due to Lack 
of Hydrostatic Head
I 
imagine that many readers might skip this chapter. After all, a 
nozzle is simply a hole in a vessel, flanged up to a pipe (see 
Fig. 16.1). Why a whole chapter? Well, it is not that simple. 
Lots of process problems occur due to improperly designed draw-
off nozzles.
16.1  Nozzle Exit Loss 
The pressure drop of a fluid flowing through a nozzle is equal to
H = 0.34 × V2
where H = pressure loss of the fluid as it flows through the nozzle, 
in inches of fluid
	
V = velocity of the fluid, as it flows through the nozzle, in 
feet per second
This equation assumes that before the fluid enters the nozzle, its 
velocity is small, compared to its velocity in the nozzle. The increase 
in the velocity, or the kinetic energy, of the fluid in the nozzle comes 
from the pressure of the fluid. This is Bernoulli’s equation in action. 
The energy to accelerate the fluid in the draw-off nozzle comes from 
the potential energy of the fluid. This is Newton’s second law of 
motion.
The coefficient used in the equation above (0.34) assumes the 
process fluid has a low viscosity. For most process nozzles, this is a 
183

reasonable assumption. Detailed information on draw-off nozzle 
coefficients has been published in Crane.1
For me, I don’t trust published coefficients. I like to prove it myself: 
prove it by experimentation. Often, Liz (my coauthor) calls to me in the 
bathroom, “Norm, what are you doing? You’ve been in the bathroom 
forever.”
What I’m doing is running water into the bathtub at a measured rate. 
I wait for the water to drain out until an equilibrium height is established. 
I have to get the height (DH) high enough to suppress vortexing. Then, 
using the diameter of the drain, I calculate the velocity (V) of the water 
flowing out the drain. I can then calculate the coefficient (0.34). It’s a good 
thing I married Liz. The average woman might think I’m weird.
Let’s take a close look at the use of the term H. Figure 16.2 shows 
a bucket with a hole punched in its side. The velocity of the water as

it escapes from the hole is V in the preceding equation. The height of 
water in the bucket above the center of the hole is H. If we replaced 
the water in the bucket with gasoline, which has a lower density, the 
same hole velocity would occur with the same height of fluid.
The pressure drop of the fluid escaping from the bucket is called 
nozzle exit loss. Actually, nothing is lost; the potential energy, or pres-
sure head of the water in the bucket, is just converted into velocity or 
kinetic energy.
16.1.1  Converting H to Pressure Drop
A column of water 28 inch high exerts a head pressure of 1 psi, as 
shown in Fig. 16.3. To determine the pressure drop of water flowing 
through a hole, in pounds per square inch, we would calculate

where P = pressure drop in psi.
But perhaps we have gasoline flowing through the hole. The den-
sity of water is 62 lb/ft3; the density of gasoline is 40 lb/ft3. Since the 
weight, or pressure head, of a column of fluid is proportional to its 
density, we calculate

Again, P is the pressure drop, in psi, of the gasoline escaping 
through a hole in the bucket. If we have a vapor flowing out of the over-
head nozzle on a fractionator, as shown in Fig. 16.4, the pressure drop of 
the vapor escaping from the vessel in the overhead vapor line is

where P = pressure drop of a fluid, psi
	
Dv = density of a fluid such as a vapor, lb/ft3
	
V = velocity of fluid in nozzle, ft/s
This is an important equation to remember. It is the “pressure 
drop through a hole” equation. It works for water, steam, air, gaso-
line, alcohol, and all other fluids, unless viscosity is important. A vis-
cosity of less than 5 or 10 centipoise (cP) or centistokes (cSt) (such as 
hot maple syrup) means that viscosity is not important.
16.2  Critical Flow
Everything I have just said is wrong when the fluid we are work-
ing with undergoes critical flow. First, critical flow applies only to com-
pressible fluids such as vapor, steam, air, or gases. Second, as long as 
the pressure drop that we calculate through the nozzle is less than 20 
or 30 percent of the upstream pressure, we can ignore critical flow.

Critical flow occurs when a compressible fluid velocity approaches 
the speed of sound: about 1000 ft/s. Process piping handling vapor is 
typically designed to work at a velocity of 100 ft/s.
16.3  Maintaining Nozzle Efficiency
16.3.1  Nozzle Limitations
Figure 16.5 is an exact representation of my bathtub. When my tub 
has a water level of 28 inch, the pressure right above the drain, at P1, 
is 1 psi. Having bathed, I now pull the plug. I also start the water run-
ning into the tub, to keep the water level at 28 in.
The velocity of water flowing from the tub through the drain is 
20 ft/s. The pressure drop, in psi, of the water as it escapes from the 
tub, is

The pressure at P1 is now the 1-psi static head minus the 5-psi noz-
zle exit loss or negative 4 psig (or positive 10.7 psia). That is, the pres-
sure at the drain is a substantial partial vacuum, or a negative pressure. 
By the term negative pressure I mean that it is below atmospheric pres-
sure (atmospheric pressure at sea level is 16.7 psia).
This suggests that the pressure in a water drain can get so low that 
air could be sucked out of the bathroom and down the drain. Of course, 
we all see this happen several times a day—typically when we flush a 
toilet. So much air is drawn into the water drainage piping that we 
install vents on our roofs to release this air. The only requirement, then, 
for vapors to be drawn into a flowing nozzle is for the nozzle exit loss 
to be larger than the static head of liquid above the nozzle.
Incidentally, if a bird builds its nest on top of one of our roof toilet 
vents, we find the toilet will no longer flush properly. The experienced

plumber states that the toilet won’t flush because it is suffering from 
“vapor lock,” and this is true. A working knowledge of process equip-
ment fundamentals often comes in quite handy around the home.
16.3.2  Effect of Bubble-Point Liquid
I have to confess to an odd habit. I sometimes bathe in boiling 
water. Draining a vessel full of liquid at its bubble or boiling point 
prevents the formation of a negative pressure, or partial vacuum, 
in the drain. As soon as the vacuum begins to form, the liquid will 
begin to generate vapor. This vapor would tend to restrict the flow 
of liquid as it exits the drain, and thus reduce its flow rate. As the 
velocity of the liquid flowing into the drain decreases, the pres-
sure of the liquid at the inlet to the drain will increase. This increase 
in pressure will be just sufficient to suppress vaporization of the 
liquid in the drain (i.e., the liquid velocity will be reduced just 
enough to cause sufficient increase in pressure to prevent the 
liquid boiling).
Figure 16.6 illustrates the side draw-off of a fractionator. The 
liquid at point A is at its bubble or boiling point. We can be quite sure 
that this is true, because the liquid and vapor are in intimate contact 
at the vapor-liquid interface. We say that the vapor is at its dew point, 
and that the liquid is at its bubble point.
But how about the liquid at point B? Is this liquid also at its boiling 
or bubble point? It is the same liquid, having the same temperature 
and composition as the liquid at point A. But the pressure at point B is 
slightly higher than the pressure at point A.

The pressure at point A is the pressure in the vessel: 10 psig. The 
pressure at point B is the pressure at point A plus the static head of 
liquid H, shown in Fig. 16.6. Let’s assume that this liquid is water. 
Also, H equals 28 in. Then the pressure at point B is

The boiling point of water at 10 psig is about 240°F. This means 
that the temperature in the entire water draw-off sump is 240°F. But 
the pressure at point B is 1 psi above the water’s bubble or boiling 
point. We say, then, that the water at point B is subcooled by an equiv-
alent of 28 inch of liquid, or 1 psi.
But how about the pressure at point D? The liquid at both points B 
and D has the following in common:
• Same elevation
• Same fluid temperature
• Same fluid composition
If liquid is flowing through the nozzle, shown in Fig. 16.6, at, say, 
9 ft/s, the pressure at point D will be lower than that at point B. 
Assuming the velocity in the draw-off sump to be close to zero, we 
can calculate the pressure at point D as follows: head loss due to 
increased velocity = 0.34 × 92 = 28 inch of water.
As 28 inch of water equals 1 psi of head pressure, the head loss 
due to increased velocity at the nozzle exit equals 1 psi. Thus, the 
pressure at point D will then be 11 psig minus 1 psi, that is, 10 psig.
16.3.3  Cavitation
For practice, calculate the pressure at point D assuming that the nozzle 
exit velocity is 10 ft/s. If you calculated 9.8 psig, you are likely wrong. 
You see, the water will start to flash to steam if it falls below its boiling-
point pressure. The boiling-point pressure of water at 240°F is 10 psig. 
As steam is evolved at a lower pressure, the large volume of vapor 
chokes off the flow in the draw-off nozzle. The flow of water slows 
down. As the velocity of the water decreases, its pressure increases. The 
pressure will increase to 10 psig—that is, the boiling-point pressure of 
water at 240°F. At this pressure, the vaporization of the liquid in the 
draw-off nozzle is zero.
In summary, the lowest pressure that can be reached at point D in 
Fig. 16.6 is the pressure at point A. When these two pressures are 
equal, we say that the draw-off nozzle is limited by cavitation. If we 
were to lower the pressure downstream of point D, say, by opening a 
control valve, the increase in flow would be zero.

16.3.3.1  Vortex Breakers in Draw-Off Nozzles
The coefficient for nozzle exit loss of 0.34, shown above, assumes 
that there is no vortex breaker in the nozzle. Vortex breakers are 
certainly required if nozzle exit velocities exceed 4 ft/s. Vortex 
breakers are usually not needed if velocities in the draw-off nozzle 
are less than 2 ft/s.
As most such nozzles are designed at less than 2 ft/s, in general 
vortex breakers are not needed in most applications. However, many 
process plants have vortex breakers in all draw-off nozzles as part of 
their standard spec. This is bad for two reasons:
• Vortex breakers create turbulence, reduce the open area of 
nozzles, and thus lead to premature nozzle cavitation limits.
• Much more importantly, vortex breakers trap rags, gloves, 
and other trash left in towers during construction or turn-
arounds. If a draw-off nozzle is equipped with both a down-
comer seal pan and a draw-off box, then the draw-off nozzle 
is difficult, and oftentimes impossible, to inspect. Installing a 
vortex breaker that is not needed due to low draw-off veloci-
ties is just looking for trouble, without any justification.
If you note a trace of bitterness pertaining to the over zealous 
use of vortex breakers in my text, it is not without reason. The use of 
a totally unneeded vortex breaker in the bottom of a 90,000 BSD 
vacuum tower in the old ESSO LAGO Refinery in Aruba cost the new 
owners of the plant (Coastal) many millions of dollars in lost gas-oil 
production.
If you must use a vortex breaker, please consult my book, Process 
Design for Reliable Operations, to see how one can design a draw-off 
sump to prevent the vortex breaker from fouling.
16.3.4  External Restrictions
Figure 16.7 shows two almost identical draw-off arrangements. The 
only difference is the elevation of the control valve in the draw-off 
line. Control valve A is at the same elevation as the draw-off nozzle. 
The pressure drop across the control valve is 2 psi, or 56 inch of water. 
Let’s assume that
• The increase in velocity through the draw-off nozzle is small, 
and hence the nozzle exit loss is zero.
• The frictional loss through the piping and nozzle is zero.
Even after we have made these two unlikely assumptions, the 
height of hot water in the draw-off sump must still be 56 inch above 
the center line of the draw-off nozzle. If not, the water would begin 
flashing to steam as it experienced a pressure drop of 2 psi flowing 
across the control valve. The evolved steam would then choke the 

	
D r a w - O f f  N o z z l e  H y d r a u l i c s 	
191
water flow, reducing the pressure drop across the control valve until 
the pressure drop equaled the depth (or head) of water in the draw-off 
sump.
Control valve B in Fig. 16.7 is located 56 inch below the draw-off 
nozzle. The pressure drop across the valve is still 2 psi, or 56 in. of 
water. Again, we will neglect nozzle exit loss and friction loss. But in 
this case, the height of water in the draw-off sump may be zero. Why?

C h a p t e r  S i x t e e n
Referring to Fig. 16.7, the pressure head of water above control 
valve B is an extra 2 psi, or 56 inch of water. Thus, even if control 
valve B loses 2 psi of pressure, the water will not flash to steam. And 
this is true even when the sump is almost empty.
Does this mean that control valves should be located well below 
the elevation of the draw-off nozzle? Yes!
Does this mean that the amount of piping, fittings, gate valves, etc., 
should be minimized on a draw-off line, until the line drops 10 or 
20 ft below the draw-off nozzle? Yes!
Does this mean any frictional losses due to external piping at the 
same elevation as the draw-off nozzle have to be added to the 
nozzle exit loss in determining the liquid level in the sump? Yes!
16.3.5  Increasing Flow from a Draw-Off Sump
If the flow is limited by nozzle exit loss, because the nozzle diameter 
is small or because the sump is shallow, no process change will 
increase the flow. However, if the restriction is outside of the vessel 
because of valves, fittings, or piping on the draw-off line, located at 
the same elevation as the draw-off nozzle, then there is an option to 
marginally increase flow.
Remove the insulation on the piping immediately downstream of 
the nozzle and spray cold water on the bare pipe. Reducing the tem-
perature by a few degrees will subcool the liquid and suppress in-line 
vaporization or cavitation. This should permit an increase in the flow 
of product. It’s the same idea as the common practice of operators 
spraying water on the suction of a hot pump to suppress pump cavi-
tation as the flow rate is increased.
16.4  Overcoming Nozzle Exit Loss Limits
I once tried to increase the flow of jet fuel from a crude distillation 
column by opening the draw-off flow-control valve. Opening the 
valve from 30 to 100 percent did not increase the flow of jet fuel at all. 
This is a sure sign of nozzle exit loss—or cavitation limits. To prove 
my point, I increased the level of liquid in the draw-off sump from 2 
to 4 ft. Since flow is proportional to velocity and head loss is propor-
tional to (velocity)2, the flow of jet fuel increased from 1000 to 1414 GPM. 
That is, the flow increased in proportion to the square root of the 
increase of liquid level in the sump. But the sump was only 4 ft high, 
and I needed to increase jet fuel flow even further. So I raised the 
pressure in the crude column from 10 to 14 psig. This increased the 
pressure in the draw-off sump by 4 psi.
The results of this increase in pressure are shown in Fig. 16.8. At 
first, the increase in pressure greatly increased the flow of jet fuel. But 
after a few minutes, jet fuel flow slipped back to its original rate. 
What happened?

Figure 16.8  Equilibrium limits draw-off rates.
The problem is equilibrium. When the pressure in the tower was 
raised, lighter components from the vapor were forced to dissolve in 
the pool of liquid in the draw-off sump. This meant that, at the new 
equilibrium conditions, the lighter liquid would boil not at 10 psig 
but at 14 psig. But the composition of the liquid already in the sump 
did not change for a while. It took some time for the lighter liquid 
formed at the vapor liquid interface to displace the heavier liquid, 
already in the sump. During this period of time, jet fuel flow increased. 
But when the lighter liquid reached the draw-off nozzle, it began to 
vaporize. Flow was choked off by the evolving vapors, until the flow 
was reduced to the original rate. This is another symptom of a tower 
draw-off limited by nozzle exit loss or nozzle cavitation.
16.4.1  The Rule of Errors
This incident about the jet fuel draw-off happened at the Chevron 
refinery in 1987. It’s true that I never solved the problem. It’s also true 
that I rather made a fool of myself to the amusement of the operators. 
But still, I recall the incident as a happy memory.
The concept of the surface of a liquid pool reaching equilibrium 
with an altered vapor phase before the bulk of the liquid reaches 
equilibrium is a really useful idea. It’s one of the reasons for a lag 
between a step change in an independent variable and the response 
of a dependent variable.
This incident got me thinking about the interrelationship between 
process dynamics and vapor-liquid equilibrium. So, even though I 
had made an error, I gained some important insights. Most of the 
things I’ve learned are through field observation.

It’s like collecting snowflakes. I learned in school that no two 
snowflakes are identical. They’re all six-pointed—but different. I had 
never seen a snowflake close up. So one snowy night I slipped out of 
my apartment in Brooklyn with a piece of black velvet. Sure enough, 
not only were all the snowflakes different, but each flake itself was a 
thing of wonder and joy.
Sitting in the office, you’re warm and safe. Safe from making errors. 
But to progress, to learn, to advance the process and yourself, you’ve 
got to take chances. The chances are that if you go out to the plant and 
try a new idea, it won’t work. Ninety percent of the time you will be 
wrong. But 100 percent of the time you’ll learn something new.
16.4.2  Nozzle Exit Loss Calculation
My standard calculation for nozzle exit loss as shown at the start of 
this chapter is:
	
ΔH = 0.34 (V2)	
(16.1)
where V = velocity, feet per second 
 
ΔH = head converted to velocity, in inches, measured from the 
center of the nozzle
The coefficient of 0.34 is one that I’ve arrived at by measurement 
in my water barrel and bathtub, and then added a small safety factor 
for design purposes.
The actual theoretical calculation for converting head to accelera-
tion is shown below:
• Step One—Let’s assume that I have 1 lb of liquid flowing 
through a nozzle at a velocity of V feet per second.
• Step Two—To increase the kinetic energy of the liquid from 
no velocity to V requires:
	
(0.5) (M) (V)2	
(16.2)
or since M = 1 pound of mass
	
(0.5) (V)2	
(16.3)
• Step Three—I’ll now divide by the gravitational constant at 
the surface of planet Earth (32.2 ft per second squared):
	
(0.5) (V) ft (sec)2 ÷ (32 ft/sec2)	
(16.4)
or 
	
(0.0155) (V)2 ft	
(16.5)
• Step Four—To convert feet to inches of liquid, I’ll multiply 
by 12:
	
(0.0156) (V2) ft × (12 inch/ft)	
(16.6)

	
D r a w - O f f  N o z z l e  H y d r a u l i c s 	
195
or
	
0.19 (V2) (inches)	
(16.7)
Then ΔH in inches of liquid equals:
	
ΔH = 0.19 (V2)	
(16.8)
The difference between the 0.19 coefficient in Eq. (16.8) and the 
0.34 coefficient in Eq. (16.1) is due to friction losses through the noz-
zle and my safety factor used for design. All I have done with the 
above calculation is convert kinetic energy into potential energy. The 
purpose of this calculation is to demonstrate that there is a real theo-
retical basis for some of my basic rules of thumb. One of the best 
ways to improve one’s engineering skills is to compare, on a quanti-
tative basis, engineering theory and practice.
16.4.3  Pressure Recovery in Nozzles
If pressure is partially converted to velocity as a fluid accelerates 
through a nozzle, does this suggest that as a fluid enters a vessel 
through a nozzle, its velocity is partly converted back into pressure? 
Actually, I have observed this small effect in vacuum tower flash 
zone inlets, when I was measuring pressures to the nearest mm of Hg. 
Perhaps one-half to one-third of the energy used to accelerate a flow 
as a fluid enters a pipe from a vessel might be recovered when the 
fluid exits the pipe into a downstream vessel. The pressure not recov-
ered is due to friction and turbulence. I almost always ignore nozzle 
pressure recovery in my calculations and field troubleshooting except 
in vacuum tower applications.

CHAPTER  17
Pumparounds and 
Tower Heat Flows
Closing the Tower Enthalpy Balance
T
here are two ways to remove heat from a distillation tower: top 
reflux and circulating reflux. In this chapter, we call a circulating-
reflux stream a pumparound.
The vast majority of fractionators have top reflux. Cold liquid 
from the reflux drum is pumped onto the top tray of the tower. The 
cold liquid flashes to a hotter vapor. For example, let’s say 1500 lb/h 
of liquid butane at 100°F flashes to 1500 lb/h of vapor at 260°F.
The specific heat of butane is 0.6 Btu/[(lb)(°F)]. The latent heat of 
butane is 130 Btu/lb (latent heat means the heat needed to change a 
pound of liquid into a pound of vapor at the same temperature). The 
heat removed by the top reflux is
(260°F - 100°F)(0.6)(1500) = 144,000 Btu/h = sensible heat

17.1  The Pumparound
17.1.1  Pumparound Heat Removal
Figure 17.1 shows an alternate method, called circulating reflux or 
pumparound, to remove heat from a tower. Hot liquid, at 500°F, is 
drawn from tray 10, which is called the pumparound draw tray. The 
liquid pumparound is cooled to 400°F. The cooled liquid is returned 
to the tower at a higher elevation onto tray 9. It appears from Fig. 17.1 
that the cold 400°F pumparound return liquid is entering the down-
comer from tray 8. This is often good design practice. Tray 9 is called 
the pumparound return tray.
197

	
198	
C h a p t e r  S e v e n t e e n
The purpose of the pumparound is to cool and partially condense the 
up-flowing vapors. The vapors to pumparound tray 10 are at 600°F. The 
vapors from the pumparound return tray 9 are at 450°F. There are two 
pumparound trays (9 and 10) in the column. This is the minimum number 
used. A typical number of pumparound trays is 2 to 5.
Let’s calculate the heat removed in the pumparound circuit 
shown in Fig. 17.1. Assume that the specific heat of the pumparound 
liquid is 0.7 Btu/[(lb)(°F)]:
(500°F - 400°F) × (0.7) × 1000 lb/h = 70,000 Btu/h
I have not shown the flow of liquid on the cold side of the pumpa-
round heat exchanger in Fig. 17.1, but we can calculate its flow. Let’s 
assume that the specific heat of the cold-side liquid is 0.5 Btu/[(lb)(°F)]. 
Then the cold-side (or shell-side) flow is

through tray 10 from 600 to 450°F as it leaves tray 9. But for what pur-
pose? Figure 17.2 shows the rest of the tower we have been discussing. 
Note that the tower-top reflux flow is controlling the tower-top tempera-
ture. If we were to reduce the pumparound circulation rate, less heat 
would be extracted from trays 9 and 10. More and hotter vapor would 
flow up the tower. The top reflux temperature control valve would open. 
The top reflux rate would go up. The vaporization of reflux on the top 
tray would increase. The overhead condenser duty would increase.
The decrease in the heat duty of the pumparound heat exchanger 
would equal the increase in the heat duty of the overhead condenser. 
Thus, we say that the heat balance of the tower is preserved. Some of 
the heat that was being recovered to the cold fluid, shown in Fig. 17.2, 
is now lost to cooling water in the overhead condenser. This shows 
the most important function of pumparounds: recovering heat to a 
process stream that would otherwise be lost to the cooling tower.
Let’s say that the cooling-water outlet temperature from the con-
denser was 140°F. This is bad. The calcium carbonates in the cooling 
water will begin to deposit as water-hardness deposits inside the tubes.

It is best to keep the cooling-water outlet temperature below 125°F to 
retard such deposits. Increasing the pumparound heat removal will 
lower the cooling-water outlet temperature.
Another purpose of the pumparound is to suppress top-tray 
flooding. If tray 1 or 2 in Fig. 17.2 floods, the operator would observe 
the following:
• The tower-top temperature would increase.
•	 The distillate product would become increasingly contami-
nated with heavier components. If this were a refinery crude 
fractionator, we would say that the endpoint of the naphtha 
overhead product would increase.
•	 The pressure drop across the top few trays would increase.
•	 The liquid level in the reflux drum would increase.
If the operator increases the reflux rate to reduce the tower-top 
temperature, the top temperature will go up rather than down. This is a 
positive indication of top-tray flooding. The correct way to suppress top-
tray flooding is to increase the pumparound duty. This can be done by 
increasing the cold-fluid flow through the pumparound heat exchanger, 
or the pumparound flow itself could be increased. Either way, the flow 
of vapor flowing up to tray 8 will decrease. The flow of vapor through 
trays 1 to 7 will also decrease. The low vapor velocity will reduce the 
tray pressure drop. The ability of the vapor to entrain liquid will be 
reduced. The height of liquid in the downcomer will be reduced, and 
tray flooding will be suppressed.
Increasing pumparound heat duty will unload the overhead con-
denser. This will cool off the reflux drum. A colder reflux drum will 
absorb more gas into the distillate product. Less gas will be vented 
from the reflux drum, and this is often desirable.
Finally, it is best remembered that, as we said earlier in this chap-
ter, heat recovered in the pumparound heat exchanger is often a valu-
able way to recover process heat. Heat not recovered in the pumpa-
round exchanger is lost to cooling water in the overhead condenser.
17.1.3  Do Pumparounds Fractionate?
The process design engineer typically assumes that a pumparound is 
simply a way to extract heat from a tower. The engineer does not 
expect the trays used to exchange heat between the hot vapor and the 
cold liquid to also aid in fractionation. In practice, this is not what 
happens.
Let’s refer back to Fig. 17.1. Note that the vapor temperature leav-
ing tray 9 is 450°F. The temperature of the liquid leaving tray 10 is 
500°F. This sort of temperature difference shows that fractionation is 

	
P u m p a r o u n d s  a n d  To w e r  H e a t  F l o w s 	
201
taking place across the pumparound trays. The temperature differ-
ence between
DT = (temperature of liquid leaving a lower tray)
minus (temperature of vapor leaving a higher tray)
is a measure of the amount of fractionation. The bigger this temperature 
difference, the more the fractionation that is taking place across the trays. 
I have run plant tests that indicate that increasing pumparound circula-
tion rates increases this temperature difference—up to a point. However, 
if the circulation rate is increased past this point, then the temperature 
difference is reduced. This idea is expressed best in Fig. 17.3. As the 
pumparound rate is increased, tray efficiency is improved. However, at 
some point, the pumparound liquid flow becomes too great. Probably, at 
this point the downcomers start to back up. Tray efficiency is impaired 
because of this downcomer flooding. The temperature difference between 
the liquid leaving the pumparound draw tray minus the temperature of 
the vapor leaving the pumparound return tray becomes smaller. This 
point is called the incipient flood point for the pumparound trays.
17.2  Vapor Flow
17.2.1  How Top Reflux Affects Vapor Flow
Let’s assume that the vapor flow into a tower is constant. Figure 17.4 
shows such a situation. Both the pounds per hour and temperature of 
the vapor flowing up to tray 9 are constant. This means that the heat 
flow into the tower is constant.
Now, let’s increase the reflux rate. Certainly, the result will be
• The tower-top temperature will decrease.
• The gasoline overhead product flow will also decrease.

C h a p t e r  S e v e n t e e n
But what will happen to the flow of the vapor leaving tray 3, 4, or 5? 
I ask this question assuming that the pumparound heat duty is fixed. 
Will the pounds per hour of vapor flowing through trays 3, 4, or 5
• Increase?
• Decrease?
• Remain the same?
The correct answer is that the weight flow of vapor will increase! 
Surprised? Most people are. Let me explain.
When we increase the reflux rate, the tower-top temperature drops—
let’s say from 300 to 240°F. Actually, the temperature of the vapor leaving 
all the trays in the tower will decrease. The effect is bigger on the top tray 
and gradually gets smaller as the extra reflux flows down the tower. If 
the top-tray temperature has dropped by 60°F, then the vapor tempera-
ture leaving tray 9 might drop by only 5°F. Let’s assume that the extra 
reflux causes the temperature of the vapor from tray 4 to decrease by 
40°F. We can say that the sensible-heat content of the vapor has 
decreased. Sensible heat is a measure of the heat content of a vapor due to 
its temperature. If the specific heat of the vapor is 0.5 Btu/[(lb)(°F)], then

203
the decrease in the sensible-heat content of the vapor when it cools by 
40°F is 20 Btu/lb.
A small portion of this 20 Btu is picked up by the increased liquid 
flow leaving tray 4. The main portion of this heat is converted to 
latent heat. This means that some increment more, of the liquid on the 
tray turns into a vapor. But where does this extra liquid, which vapor-
izes on the tray, come from? It comes from the extra top reflux.
The vaporization of the extra reflux cools the tray. The extra vapor 
generated adds to the vapor flow from the tray. This increases the 
vapor flow from the tray. Even though the heat flow into the tower is 
constant, increasing the top reflux does increase the pounds of vapor 
flowing up the tower.
17.2.2  Reflux Effect on Vapor Molecular Weight
Let’s assume the following for the tower shown in Fig. 17.4:
• Constant vapor flow to tray 9
• Tower-top reflux flow increased
• Pumparound duty is constant
As a result of the increased reflux rate, the
• Tower-top temperature drops
• Gasoline flow drops
This is the same problem I discussed previously. It will result in 
an increase in the mass flow of the vapor through trays 3, 4, and 5. But 
what will happen to the molecular weight of the vapor? Will it increase, 
decrease, or remain the same?
The answer is that the vapor’s molecular weight will decrease as 
the reflux rate is increased. But why?
The vapor leaving each tray is in equilibrium with the liquid. This 
means that the vapor leaving each tray is at its dew point and the 
liquid leaving each tray is at its bubble point. As the top reflux rate is 
increased, all the trays are cooled. The vapors leaving trays 3, 4, and 
5 are cooled. As a vapor at its dew point cools, the heavier compo-
nents in the vapor condense into a liquid. The remaining vapors have 
a lower molecular weight because they are lighter. But this is only 
half the story. Let us continue!
As the heavier components in the vapor condense into a liquid, 
they give off heat. This heat is called the latent heat of condensation. This 
latent heat is picked up by the liquid flowing across the tray. This liquid 
flow is called the internal reflux. This latent heat promotes extra vapori-
zation of the internal reflux. Naturally, the lighter, lower-boiling-point 
components preferentially vaporize from the internal reflux. These 
lighter components have a relatively low molecular weight.

	
204	
C h a p t e r  S e v e n t e e n
The uncondensed vapors flowing from the tray below, plus the 
newly generated vapors from the reflux, flow to the tray above. 
The combined molecular weight of vapors is thus reduced. As the 
molecular weight decreases, the volume of each pound of vapor 
increases.
As the molecular weight of the vapor decreases, the density of the 
vapor decreases. As the density of a vapor is reduced, each pound of 
vapor occupies more volume. It is true that cooler vapors do occupy 
less volume per pound than do warmer vapors of the same composi-
tion. That is, gases and vapors tend to contract on cooling and expand 
on heating. However, this is a small effect compared to the increase in 
the volume of vapors, due to the decrease in the vapor’s molecular 
weight.
17.2.3  Reflux Effect on Vapor Volume
Now, let’s summarize the effect on vapor flow due to increased reflux. 
Again, we are considering trays 3, 4, and 5 in Fig. 17.4:
	
1.	 Increasing the top reflux increases the pounds of vapor flow.
	
2.	 Increasing the top reflux increases the volume per pound of 
the vapor.
	
3.	 Increasing the tower-top reflux rate increases the rate (in ft3/s) 
of vapor flow through the trays, because of the combined, 
additive effect of factors 1 and 2.
How, then, does increasing the top-tray reflux rate affect the 
vapor and liquid loading on the trays below? Obviously, the liquid 
flow rate increases. But so does the vapor flow rate.
Does this mean that trays 3, 4, and 5 could flood, because the top 
reflux rate was increased? Yes!
Does this mean that we could flood these trays without increasing 
the heat flow into the tower? Yes!
Does this mean that we could flood these trays without increasing 
the pounds of vapor flow into the tower, simply by raising the 
reflux rate? Absolutely correct!
If an increase in the tower-top reflux rate causes the top of the tower 
to flood, how should the operator respond? She should then increase 
the pumparound flow to reduce the pounds of vapor flow to tray 5, as 
shown in Fig. 17.4. But suppose this causes the pumparound trays 6, 7, 
and 8 to flood, because of the extra liquid flow? She should increase the 
cold liquid flow through the pumparound heat exchanger. If this can-
not be done either, the tower pressure can be increased. This will 
increase the density of the flowing vapors and shrink the volume of the 
vapors that the trays must handle.

	
P u m p a r o u n d s  a n d  To w e r  H e a t  F l o w s 	
205
The effect of increasing the reflux rate on a crude tower, even 
with a constant condenser duty, will be to increase the condenser 
pressure drop. This happens because the volume and the weight 
of the tower overhead vapors will increase as the tower-top tem-
perature drops. At the Calumet Refinery in Shreveport, Louisiana, 
the crude tower reflux rate was increased by 25 percent and the 
tower-top temperature dropped by 50°F–60°F. The overhead con-
denser ΔP increased from about 12 to 24 psi. The tower pressure 
was kept constant, but the reflux drum pressure declined from 17 
to 5 psig.
The mechanism that accounts for this is twofold:
 
1. Reducing the tower-top temperature converts some of the 
heat content of the vapor to latent heat of vaporization of the 
top reflux.
	
2.	 The molecular weight of the vapors leaving the top of the 
tower is reduced.
17.3  Fractionation
17.3.1  Improving Fractionation
Here is our problem. A refinery crude distillation tower is producing 
gasoline, truck diesel, and a gas oil. The diesel is contaminated with 
the gas oil. Also, the gas oil is contaminated with the lighter diesel. As 
shown in Fig. 17.5, the vapor flow into the tower is constant. Our job 
is to improve the degree of fractionation between the diesel and gas oil. 
Our objective is to remove the relatively heavy gas oil from the diesel 
and to remove the lighter diesel from the gas oil.
We could reduce the amount of diesel product drawn from the 
tower. That could wash the heavier gas oil out of the diesel. But it 
would also increase the amount of diesel in the gas oil. Increasing the 
heat removed in the pumparound would have a similar effect: less 
gas oil in diesel, but more diesel in gas oil.
How about decreasing the heat removed in the pumparound? This 
would seem to allow the lighter diesel to more easily vaporize out of the 
gas-oil product. But will this action result in increasing the contamina-
tion of diesel with heavier gas oil? This answer is no—but why not?
Reducing the pumparound heat-removal duty increases the vapor 
flow from tray 8 in the column shown in Fig. 17.5. The extra pounds of 
vapor flow up the tower and raise the tower-top temperature. The 
reflux control valve opens to cool the tower-top temperature back to 
its temperature set point. Then the liquid flow rates from trays 1, 2, 
and 3 onto tray 4 all increase. If the diesel draw-off rate is maintained 
constant, the liquid overflow rate onto trays 5, 6, and 7 will increase. 
This liquid flow is called the internal reflux. Trays 5, 6, and 7 are the 

	
206	
C h a p t e r  S e v e n t e e n
trays that fractionate between diesel and gas oil. The more efficiently 
they work, the less the contamination of the adjacent products.
The way we increase the fractionation efficiency of trays is to 
make the trays work harder. The correct engineering way to say this 
is: “To improve the separation efficiency between a light and heavy 
product, the vapor flow rate through the trays is increased, and the 
internal reflux flowing across the trays is increased.”
Again, this improvement in the degree of fractionation developed 
by trays 5, 6, and 7 is a result of reducing the amount of heat duty 
removed by the pumparound flowing across trays 8, 9, and 10.
17.3.2  Flooding the Fractionation Trays
Reducing the pumparound duty increases the tray loadings on trays 
1 through 7. But in so doing, the trays operate closer to their incipient 
flood point. This is fine. The incipient flood point corresponds to the 
optimum tray performance. But if we cross over the incipient flood 
point, and trays 5, 6, and 7 actually start to flood, their fractionation

efficiency will be adversely affected. Then, as we decrease the pump-
around heat-removal duty, the mutual contamination of diesel and 
gas oil will increase.
From an operating standpoint, we can see when this flooding 
starts. As we decrease the pumparound duty, the temperature differ-
ence between the diesel- and gas-oil product draws should increase. 
When these two temperatures start to come together, we may assume 
that we have exceeded the incipient flood point, and that trays 5, 6, 
and 7 are beginning to flood.

Flooded Condenser Control
T
he total condensation of a vapor to a liquid is best illustrated by 
the condensation of steam to water. Figure 18.1 is a rather accurate 
reproduction of the radiator that heated my apartment in Brooklyn. 
Steam flowed from the boiler in the basement. The steam condensed 
inside the radiator and flowed back into the boiler through the conden-
sate drain line. This is a form of thermosyphon circulation. The driving 
force for the circulation is the differential density between the water in the 
condensate drain line and the steam supply line to the radiator (see 
Chap. 8, for a discussion of thermosyphon reboilers).
The bigger the radiator, the more heat is provided to a room. The 
bigger the radiator, the faster the steam condenses to water inside the 
radiator. A larger radiator has more heat-transfer surface area exposed to 
the condensing steam. Unfortunately, the radiator shown in Fig. 18.1 is 
suffering from a common malfunction. Water-hardness deposits have 
partly plugged the condensate drain line. Calcium carbonate is a typ-
ical water-hardness deposit.
Anyone who has lived in an apartment house in Brooklyn will 
have had to occasionally bang on the radiator to increase heat flow. 
Banging on the radiator often breaks loose the carbonate deposits in 
the condensate drain line. The steam condensate, which has backed 
up in the radiator, now empties. This exposes more of the interior 
surface area of the radiator to the condensing steam.
It rather seems that 40 percent of the surface area of the radiator 
in Fig. 18.1 is submerged under water. If the water is drained out, 
does this mean that the rate of steam condensation will increase by 
209

	
210	
C h a p t e r  E i g h t e e n
the same 40 percent? Answer—yes! Does this mean that the radiator 
heat-transfer duty will increase by 40 percent? Answer—not quite.
18.1  Subcooling, Vapor Binding, and Condensation
18.1.1  Subcooling
18.1.1.1  Effect of Subcooling
When steam condenses at atmospheric pressure, it gives off 1000 Btu/lb 
of condensing steam. This is called the latent heat of condensation of steam.
When water cools off from 220 to 120°F, it gives off 100 Btu/lb of 
water. This heat represents the sensible-heat content of water between 
220 and 120°F.
It takes less of the radiator’s surface area to condense 1 lb of steam 
at 220°F than to cool off 1 lb of water from 220 to 120°F. And this is true 
even though the condensation of steam generates 10 times as much 
heat as the cooling of hot water.
Does this mean that it is a lot easier to condense steam than to 
cool water? Yes. This also explains, then, why condensate backup 
reduces the rate of heat transfer and condensation.
18.1.1.2  Mechanics of Subcooling
As the condensed steam flow out of the radiator is restricted, the surface 
area of the radiator available to cool the hot water increases. Hence, the 
water temperature leaving the radiator decreases. To summarize, the effect 
of restricting the condensate flow from a radiator or condenser is to
• Build the water level in the radiator
• Reduce the rate of latent-heat transfer from the steam

• Increase the rate of sensible-heat transfer from the condensate
• Reduce the overall heat-transfer duty from the radiator
Incidentally, the correct way to remove hardness deposit is by 
chemical cleaning. Violent banging on radiators is considered bad 
form in South Brooklyn.
18.1.2  Air Lock
Vapor binding, or air lock, is another common cause of household 
radiator malfunction. Often, the vapor accumulating in the radiator 
is CO2, rather than air. The CO2 originates from the thermal decom-
position of carbonates in the boiler. Regardless, air and CO2 form a 
non-condensable vapor in the radiator. These non-condensables 
mix with the steam in the radiator. The non-condensables then 
reduce the concentration of the steam by dilution. The diluted steam 
has a lower partial pressure than pure steam. The lower the partial 
pressure of the steam, the more difficult it is to condense. As the rate 
of condensation of the steam drops, so does the heat radiated by the 
radiator.
In refinery steam condensation services (in both reboilers and 
steam turbines exhausting to vacuum surface condensers), I have 
observed that small amounts of non-condensables greatly reduce the 
apparent heat-transfer coefficient.
In reboilers, propane or butane may leak into the lower-pressure 
steam side of the reboiler. In surface condensers, air could be drawn 
into the condenser’s shell, which operates under vacuum conditions. 
In the latter case, I’ve observed that the heat-transfer coefficient, 
which should be 200 Btu/hr/ft2/°F, is only about 50 Btu/hr/ft2/°F.
It seems these non-condensables are increasing the heat-transfer 
film resistance by interfering with the ability of the steam molecules 
to come into contact with the cooler heat-transfer surface area. A tiny 
amount of air in a steam condenser will reduce the rate of the steam 
condensation by an order of magnitude (see Chaps. 24 and 25).
To restore the efficiency of a radiator suffering from the accumu-
lation of non-condensables inside its condensing coils, the non- 
condensable gases have to be removed. The air vent shown in Fig. 18.1 
serves this purpose.
18.1.2.1  Explanation of Vapor Binding
We can measure the non-condensable concentration in the flow of a 
mostly condensable vapor such as steam. However, the actual con-
centration of non-condensables in contact with the condensate layer 
around the tube wall or inside the tube is much greater. While the 
condensable vapor condenses and drains away as a liquid phase, the 
only way the non-condensables can escape from the tube surface is by 
diffusion backwards against the bulk of the vapor flow. In order to 
make this diffusion possible, there must be a concentration gradient 

	
212	
C h a p t e r  E i g h t e e n
with a higher non-condensable concentration near the tube surface, 
which then impedes the condensation rate of the bulk of the vapor flow 
(see R. S. Silver, Proc. Inst. Mech. Engineers, Vol. 178, p. 351, 1963–1964). 
This explains why a small amount of venting non-condensables 
often has the dramatic effect of increasing condensation rates, espe-
cially when condensing pure components such as steam.
I also believe that this explains a problem that I’ve seen several 
times in steam turbine exhaust vacuum surface condensers. That is, 
an apparent large loss in the steam heat-transfer coefficient, due to a 
relatively small air leak into the vacuum surface condenser’s shell.
To summarize, the two most common malfunctions of a steam 
condenser (or radiator) are
• Condensate backup
• Non-condensable accumulation
And these two malfunctions are also the most common problems we 
encounter in the design and operation of shell-and-tube heat exchang-
ers used in total condensation service for hydrocarbons, as well as for 
steam.
18.1.3  Condensation and Condenser Design
18.1.3.1  Condensation in Shell-and-Tube Heat Exchangers
If what you have just read seems to be a repetition of the discussion 
of steam reboilers in Chap. 12, your analysis is correct. A steam 
reboiler has the same problems and works on the same principles as 
a process condenser. The only difference is that a steam reboiler’s 
heat is removed by the shell-side process fluid, and a process con-
denser’s heat is removed by cooling water or air.
Figure 18.2 is a sketch of a depropanizer overhead condenser. 
Let’s make a few assumptions about this shell-and-tube condenser:
• The propane is totally condensed as it enters the reflux drum.
• There is no vapor vented from the reflux drum, but there is a 
vapor-liquid interface in the drum.
• The reflux drum is elevated by 20 ft above the top of the 
condenser.
• We are dealing with pure (100 percent) propane.
If the liquid level in the reflux drum is located 20 ft above the 
condenser, does this mean that the liquid level in the pipe feeding the 
condenser is also 20 ft above the condenser? Is this possible? No!
If the pipe to the condenser maintained a liquid level, then the 
shell side of the condenser would be full of propane. But if the shell 
side of the condenser were really liquid full, the tubes would not 

	
C o n d e n s e r s  a n d  To w e r  P r e s s u r e  C o n t r o l 	
213
contact the vapor. If the tubes do not contact the vapor, then the rate 
of condensation is zero. Perhaps a small amount of heat transfer 
would take place as the liquid propane became subcooled. But none 
of the propane vapor would condense.
Therefore, the liquid level in the overhead condenser would have 
to be somewhere in the condenser’s shell. But then the liquid in the 
condenser would be below the reflux drum. How, then, does the liquid 
get from the lower elevation of the condenser to the higher elevation in 
the reflux drum? We will have to explain this hydraulic problem later. 
But for now, we can say that most reflux drums are elevated 20 or 30 ft 
above grade to provide net positive suction head (NPSH) for the reflux 
pump. Also, most shell-and-tube condensers are located at grade for 
easier maintenance during unit turnarounds.
18.1.3.2  Subcooling in a Shell-and-Tube Condenser
Figure 18.3 is the same propane condenser shown in Fig. 18.2. Let’s 
assume that the pressure drop through the shell side is zero. Again, 
we are dealing with a pure component: propane. The inlet vapor is 
at its dew point. That means it is saturated vapor. Under these cir-
cumstances, the outlet liquid should be a saturated liquid, or liquid at 
its bubble point. As the inlet dew-point temperature is 120°F, the 
outlet bubble-point temperature should be 120°F. But, as can be 
seen in Fig. 18.3, the outlet shell-side liquid temperature is 90°F, not 
120°F. Why?

C h a p t e r  E i g h t e e n
The reason is condensate backup. The condensate backup causes 
subcooling; that is, the liquid is cooled below its bubble point or satu-
rated liquid temperature. Perhaps a rat has lodged in the condensate 
outlet pipe. The rat restricts condensate drainage from the shell side. 
To force its way past the dead rat, the propane backs up in the con-
denser. The cold tubes in the bottom of the shell are submerged in 
liquid propane. The liquid propane is cooled below its bubble-point 
temperature.
Note that the propane vapor is still condensing to propane liq-
uid at 120°F. The condensed liquid is in intimate contact with the 
propane vapor as it drips off the outside surface of the colder con-
denser tubes. The saturated propane vapor condenses directly to 
saturated propane liquid at 120°F. The saturated, or bubble-point, 
liquid then drips from the condensation zone of the condenser into 
the subcooling zone of the condenser. This is the zone where the 
tubes are submerged in liquid.
Try running your hand along the outside of such a condenser. 
Feel for the point on the surface of the shell where there is a noticeable 
drop in temperature. The upper part of the shell will be hot. The 
lower part of the shell will be cold. The transition point corresponds 
to the liquid level of condensate in the shell. The condensate level will 
always be higher toward the shell outlet nozzle. Again, this all applies 
only to condensers in total condensing service.

18.1.3.3  Effect of Condensate Backup
When the condensate level in an exchanger increases, the area of the 
condenser devoted to subcooling the condensate increases. But the 
area of the exchanger available for condensing decreases. That is bad!
When the area of the exchanger available for condensing is 
reduced, the ease of condensation is also decreased. Depending on 
the circumstances, one of two unfavorable things will now happen:
	
1.	 If the supply pressure of the condensing vapor is fixed, the rate 
of condensation of the vapor will fall. In an apartment house in 
Brooklyn, this means that your bedroom will get cold.
	
2.	 If the condensing vapor flow rate is fixed, the condensation 
pressure will increase. If you are operating a debutanizer in 
Texas City, this means that the tower’s safety release valve will 
pop open and release a cloud of butane over Lamar University.
Heat removed by condensation is easy. The heat-transfer coefficient 
U for condensation of pure, clean vapors may be 400 to 1000 Btu/hr/ft2 
of heat-exchanger surface area, per °F of temperature-driving force. 
The U value for subcooling stagnant liquid may be only 10 to 30. 
Condensate backup is the major cause of lost heat transfer for heat 
exchangers in condensing service.
18.1.3.4  Reflux Drum Elevation Increase Promotes Subcooling
Once upon a time many years ago, a tragic event occurred in Louisiana. 
A rat entered the condenser outlet pipe shown in Fig. 18.4. The con-
denser had been off line for cleaning. The rat, having crawled up the 
riser pipe to the reflux drum, got its head stuck in the drum’s inlet 
nozzle. Your author, unaware of the rodent’s predicament, put the 
exchanger back into service. The condensed butane now flowed across 
the rat. The rat died. Well, we all must come to that end eventually, 
although perhaps not quite that exact end. Such is the way of all flesh.
This rat is called a “20-lb rat.” Not that the rat weighed 20 lb. The 
20 lb refers to the pressure drop of 20 psi that the liquid encountered 
as it flowed across the rat’s now-lifeless body. Before the introduction 
of this pressure restriction, the butane entering the reflux drum was 
at its bubble point. Our question is, will the introduction of the rat at 
the inlet nozzle cause the butane, as it enters the vessel, to flash?
The term “to flash” is used to denote partial vaporization of the 
butane. Before the rat became stuck, the liquid entering the reflux 
drum did not flash or partly vaporize.
We can also be sure that at steady state the butane liquid did not 
flash after the introduction of the rat because no vapor was vented 
from the reflux drum.
But let’s assume that in the first microsecond after the introduc-
tion of the rat the liquid did vaporize. The vapor so generated would 

	
216	
C h a p t e r  E i g h t e e n
be trapped in the reflux drum. The pressure in the drum would 
increase. Not by 20 psig, but just a little. The small increase in pressure 
in the reflux drum would push up the liquid level in the condenser. 
The surface area of the condenser available to subcool the liquid 
would increase. The liquid temperature would be reduced. As the 
subcooled liquid flowed across the dead rat, its pressure would drop. 
The liquid’s pressure would fall to exactly that pressure that corre-
sponds to the vapor pressure of the butane at the temperature in the 
reflux drum.
The backup of butane liquid in the condenser would continue 
until the butane leaving the condenser was cold enough so that it 
would not flash as it flowed across the rat—that is, until equilibrium 
conditions had been re-established in the reflux drum.
As the butane liquid level in the condenser increased, the area of 
the exchanger exposed to the condensing vapors would decrease. 
Let’s assume that the tower’s reboiler duty was constant. The vapor 
flow rate to the condenser would then be constant. To condense the 
same flow rate of vapor with a shrinking exchanger surface area, the 
pressure of condensation must increase. The tower pressure would 
also go up as the condenser pressure rose.

Forget about the rat. I made that story up. The real story is that 
the riser pipe connecting the condenser outlet to the reflux drum was 
undersized. Nat Taylor, the project engineer, specified a 4-inch pipe 
when an 8-inch pipe was needed. The pressure drop through the pipe 
was then 32 times higher than the intended P of 0.60 psig (P in a 
pipe varies to the fifth power of the pipe’s diameter). The resulting 
riser pipe pressure drop was 20 psi. This frictional loss of 20 psi 
in the pipe had the exact same effect on the condenser—and on the 
tower’s pressure—as the 20-lb rat.
Forget about Nat. Forget about the rat. Both stories are pure fic-
tion. The truth is that the elevation of the reflux drum was 80 ft above 
the condenser. The specific gravity of the butane liquid was 0.59. This 
means that 80 ft of liquid exerted a head pressure of about 20 psig:

where s.g. = specific gravity.
This elevation head loss of 20 psig had the same effect on the 
condenser—and on the tower’s pressure—as did the rat or Nat’s 
frictional loss.
18.1.3.5  Common Design Error
Please refer back to Fig. 18.2. How can the liquid from the condenser 
rise to the higher elevation in the reflux drum without being pumped? 
Simple! The pressure head of the liquid leaving the condenser is con-
verted to elevation as the liquid flows up into the reflux drum. This 
works fine as long as the liquid leaving the condenser is sufficiently 
subcooled. By “sufficiently subcooled,” I mean that when the lower-
pressure liquid flows into the reflux drum, it has to be cold enough so 
that it does not flash.
The liquid leaving the condenser is subcooled. The liquid enter-
ing the reflux drum is saturated liquid at its bubble point. Of course, 
the temperature of the liquid is the same at both points. The sub-
cooled liquid is “subcooled” in the sense that its pressure is above 
the bubble-point pressure at the condenser outlet temperature. It is 
this extra pressure, above the bubble-point pressure, that may be 
converted to elevation.
I have another way to explain how the condensed liquid can flow 
uphill from the condenser into the elevated reflux drum. That is, the 
liquid leaving the condenser is pushed into the reflux drum by the 
higher pressure in the tower. This will work okay, as long as the liq-
uid entering the reflux drum is at its saturated bubble-point tempera-
ture and pressure. If this is not the case, then the vapors flashing out 
in the reflux drum will have to be vented. If you refuse to open this 
vent, then condensate backup must increase in the condenser, with a 
consequent reduction in the condenser’s capacity.

18.2  Pressure Control
18.2.1  Tower Pressure Control
For total condensers, there are three general schemes for controlling 
distillation tower pressure:
• Throttling the cooling water flow to the condenser
• Flooding the condenser
• Hot-vapor bypass around the condenser
Regardless of the method selected, the principal concept of tower 
pressure control is the same. We control the pressure in the reflux 
drum by manipulating the temperature in the reflux drum. The tower 
pressure then floats on the reflux drum pressure. To lower the 
tower pressure, we must first cool the reflux drum. This reduces the 
vapor pressure of the liquid in the reflux drum.
The oldest, most direct method of pressure control is throttling on the 
cooling-water supply. This scheme is shown in Fig. 18.5. Closing the water 
valve to the tube side of the condenser increases the condenser outlet tem-
perature. This makes the reflux drum hotter. The hotter liquid in the reflux 
drum creates a higher vapor pressure. The higher pressure in the reflux 
drum increases the pressure in the tower. The tower pressure is the pres-
sure in the reflux drum plus the pressure drop through the condenser.
Throttling on the cooling water works fine, as far as pressure control 
is concerned. But if the water flow is restricted too much, the cooling-
water outlet temperature may exceed 125 to 135°F. In this temperature 
range, water-hardness deposits plate out inside the tubes. Then the heat-
transfer coefficient is permanently reduced by the fouling deposits.

18.2.2  Hot-Vapor Bypass
18.2.2.1  Hot-Vapor Bypass Pressure Control
A more modern way of controlling a tower’s pressure is shown in 
Fig. 18.6. This is the hot-vapor bypass method. When the control valve on 
the vapor bypass line opens, hot vapors flow directly into the reflux drum. 
These vapors are now bypassing the condenser. The hot vapors must con-
dense in the reflux drum. This is because there are no vapors vented from 
the reflux drum. So, at equilibrium, the hot vapors must condense to a 
liquid on entering the reflux drum. They have no other place to go.
The latent heat of condensation of this vapor is absorbed by the 
liquid entering the reflux drum. The liquid that enters the reflux drum 
comes from the condenser. The hot vapor mixes with the condenser 
outlet liquid and is condensed by this cooler liquid.
Does this mean, then, that the condenser outlet temperature is 
lower than the reflux drum outlet temperature? If I were to place my 
hand on the reflux pump suction line, would it be warmer than the 
condenser outlet? Answer—yes!
But the liquid in the reflux drum is in equilibrium with a vapor 
space. This liquid is at its bubble, or boiling point. If the liquid drain-
ing from the condenser is colder than this bubble-point liquid, it must

be subcooled. But how can a vapor condense directly into a subcooled 
liquid? Well, it cannot.
The tower overhead vapor, shown in Fig. 18.6, condenses to a liq-
uid on the outside of the cold condenser tubes. The liquid drips off the 
tubes. These droplets of liquid are in close contact with the saturated 
vapor in the condenser shell. This means that the liquid is in equilib-
rium with the vapor. The condensed liquid is therefore initially at its 
bubble-point temperature. This liquid accumulates in the bottom of 
the condenser’s shell. The submerged tubes then must subcool this 
liquid. Part of the surface area of the condenser is hence devoted to 
subcooling liquid, and part is devoted to condensing vapor.
But how does this work? How does the condenser know, without 
any advice from us, how much of its heat-exchanger surface area, 
which is supposed to be used to condense vapors, to divert to sub-
cooling liquid?
Let’s assume that the liquid draining from the condenser is not 
quite cold enough to absorb the entire latent heat of condensation of the 
vapors flowing through the hot-vapor bypass line. The vapors will then 
be only partially condensed. Vapor will start to accumulate in the reflux 
drum. This accumulation of vapor will increase the reflux drum pres-
sure by a small amount. The higher drum pressure will back up the 
liquid level in the condenser by a few inches. The higher height of liquid 
in the drum will submerge additional cold tubes with the condensed 
liquid. The cooler liquid will now be able to absorb more of the latent 
heat of condensation of the vapor passing through the hot-vapor bypass 
line. Eventually, a new equilibrium will be established.
18.2.2.2  Leaking Hot-Vapor Bypass Valve
Let’s assume that the hot-vapor bypass valve, shown in Fig. 18.7, is 
leaking. It is leaking 10 percent of the tower overhead flow. A good 
rule of thumb is then
• Hydrocarbons.  For each 20°F temperature difference between 
the cooler condenser outlet and the warmer reflux pump suc-
tion, 10 percent of the tower’s overhead vapor flow is leaking 
through the hot-vapor bypass valve.
• Aqueous systems.  For each 20°F temperature difference 
between the condenser outlet and the reflux pump suction, 
1 percent of the tower’s vapor flow is leaking through the 
vapor bypass valve.
As the hot-vapor bypass valve opens, the condensate level in the 
shell side of the condenser increases to produce cooler, subcooled 
liquid. This reduces the surface area of the condenser exposed to the 
saturated vapor. To condense this vapor with a smaller heat-transfer 
area, the pressure of condensation must increase. This, in turn, raises 
the tower pressure. This, then, is how opening the hot-vapor bypass 
pressure-control valve increases the tower pressure.

221
Incidentally, as I have shown in Figs. 18.6 and 18.7, the condenser 
may be located above or below the reflux drum. Both configurations 
require a subcooled liquid effluent from the condenser. But if the 
condenser is located below the reflux drum, additional subcooling to 
offset the elevation effect, described above, will be needed.
18.2.3  Flooded Condenser Pressure Control
You should have concluded by now that hot-vapor bypass pressure 
control actually works by varying the surface area of the condenser 
exposed to the saturated vapor. But why do this indirectly? Why 
don’t we simply and directly vary the liquid level in the condenser, as 
shown in Fig. 18.8?
The answer has something to do with women’s clothes. Perfectly 
good, sensible designs go out of fashion. The perfectly good, sensible 
design used to control a tower’s pressure, flooded condenser control, 
shown in Fig. 18.8, has gone out of fashion. In a flooded condenser 
tower pressure-control strategy, the reflux drum is run full. Restrict-
ing the flow from the reflux pump increases the level in the condenser. 
This reduces the heat-transfer surface area available for condensation 
and raises the tower pressure. Either the reflux or overhead product 
flows may be used to vary the liquid level in the condenser.
Once a liquid level reappears in the reflux drum, the condenser 
capacity has been exceeded. The level in the condenser will con-
tinue falling until the drum empties and the reflux pump begins to 
cavitate.
In general, flooded condenser pressure control is the preferred 
method to control a tower’s pressure. This is so because it is sim-
pler and cheaper than hot-vapor bypass pressure control. Also, the

C h a p t e r  E i g h t e e n
potential problem of a leaking hot-vapor bypass control valve 
cannot occur. Many thousands of hot-vapor bypass designs have 
eventually been converted—at no cost—to flooded condenser pres-
sure control.
The function of the reflux drum in a flooded condenser design is to
• Separate water from reflux when distilling hydrocarbons
• Give the operators time to respond if they have exceeded the 
condenser’s capacity
• Provide a place from which non-condensable vapors may be 
vented
One problem with flooded condenser pressure control is related to 
the need to occasionally vent non-condensables. This vent valve must 
not leak when closed. Since the drum is normally full of liquid, a leak-
ing vent valve will pass liquid. Many pounds of product can be lost in 
this way. A butterfly control valve with a soft, rubberized seat is a 
good choice for a remotely controlled, non-condensable vent valve.
Air-cooled condensers seem to work as well as shell-and-tube 
water coolers in flooded condenser pressure control service. Some air 
coolers are sloped toward the outlet to reduce the ratio of the delta 
condenser surface area to delta height change of condensate backup. 
I don’t think this is necessary, but it may help in fine-tuning pressure 
control with air-cooled flooded condensers.
But don’t just take my word for it. Try running on flooded con-
denser pressure control rather than hot-vapor bypass, and I think you 
will be quite pleased with the result.

18.2.4  Partial Condensation
If we normally have a situation in which non-condensable vapors 
appear in the reflux drum, then there is only one pressure-control 
option available. This is to place the tower pressure-control valve on 
the vapor off-gas as shown in Fig. 18.9. If we normally have non-
condensable vapors in the condenser effluent, then the following 
problems we have been discussing do not exist:
• Condensate backup
• Subcooling of condenser effluent
• Fouling due to low flow of the cooling-water tubes
Sometimes we see tower pressure control based on feeding a 
small amount of inert or natural gas into the reflux drum. This is bad. 
The natural gas dissolves in the overhead liquid product and typically 
flashes out of the product storage tanks. The correct way to control 
tower pressure in the absence of non-condensable vapors is to employ 
flooded condenser pressure control. If, for some external reason, a 
variable level in the reflux drum is required, then the correct design 
for tower pressure control is a hot-vapor bypass.
18.2.5  Slug Flow in Risers
Figure 18.10 illustrates a common cause of an erratic tower operating 
pressure. The condenser effluent is a two-phase mixture of vapor and 
liquid. In the summer, the tower pressure is steady. But in the winter 
when the cooling water is cold, pressure control is erratic.

The problem is phase separation in the riser line. The vertical 
velocity in this line is too low to maintain a froth flow up the riser. 
Slugs of liquid form. Periodically the accumulating liquid is blown 
out by the vapor. This slug flow causes an erratic back pressure on the 
tower but not an erratic pressure in the drum.
This problem only occurs when the drum is elevated above the 
partial condenser. The fundamental difficulty is excessive riser pipe 
diameter. To avoid slug flow in such a riser a mixed-phase velocity of 
at least 20 ft/s is needed.
While the 20 ft/sec may be maintained in the summer, more 
efficient condensation in the winter may reduce vapor flow. This 
can cause the riser velocity to drop below the minimum to prevent 
phase separation. Throttling the cooling water will stabilize the 
tower pressure, but may result in salting up the exchanger with 
water-hardness deposits.

CHAPTER 19
Air Coolers
Fin-Fan Coolers
A
ir coolers are twice as expensive to purchase and install as 
water coolers. The great advantage of an air cooler is that it 
does not need cooling water. The difficult aspect of air cooling 
arises from the flow of air across the tubes.
Most air coolers are either induced-draft or forced-draft, as shown 
in Fig. 19.1, the more common arrangement being forced-draft. The 
air is moved by rather large fans. The tubes are surrounded with foil-
type fins, typically 1 inch high. The surface area of the fins as com-
pared to the surface area of the tubes is typically 12 to 1. That is why 
we call an air cooler an extended-surface heat exchanger.
The heat-transfer coefficient of an air cooler (Btu, per hour, per 
square foot of finned area, per degree Fahrenheit) is not particularly 
good. It might be 3 to 4 for cooling a viscous liquid, or 10 to 12 for 
condensing a clean vapor. The low heat-transfer coefficients are offset 
by the large extended surface area.
19.1  Fin Fouling
In a forced-draft air cooler, cool air is blown through the underside of 
the fin tube bundle. In an induced-draft air cooler, cool air is drawn 
through the underside of the fin tubes. Either way, road dust, dead 
moths, catalyst fines, and greasy dirt accumulate along the lower row 
of tubes. As the tubes foul, they offer more resistance to the air flow. 
However, note that for forced-draft fans:
• The total air flow discharged by the fan remains constant 
regardless of the fin tube fouling.
• The fan discharge pressure remains constant regardless of the 
fin tube fouling.
• The amperage electric load on the motor driving the fan 
remains constant regardless of the fin tube fouling.
225

	
226	
C h a p t e r  N i n e t e e n
Figure 19.2 explains this apparent contradiction. As the underside 
of the fins becomes encrusted with dirt, an increasing amount of air is 
reflected back through the screen, located below the fan. The air is 
reflected back through the screen in a predictable pattern. The air flow 
in the center of the screen is always going up, which is the desired direc-
tion of flow. The air flow around the edge of the screen is always 
reversed, which is the wrong direction.
As the exterior fouling on the tubes worsens, the portion of the 
screen through which the air flows backward increases. As the dirt 
accumulates on the underside of the tubes, the portion of the screen 
through which the air is drawn upward decreases. Even though the 
air flow blown through the bundle is decreasing, the total air flow 
delivered by the fan is constant.

19.2  Fan Discharge Pressure
Fan operation is indicated on a performance curve, as shown in Fig. 19.3. 
The head developed by the fan is equivalent to 5 or 10 inch of water. As 
the fan air flow is pretty constant, the fan’s head is also constant. Another 
way of stating this is to say that as a tube bundle fouls, the resistance to 
air flow increases. This reduces the air flow through the bundle, but the 
pressure loss of the air flow through the tube bundle does not change.
If the head developed and the flow produced by a fan are both 
constant, then the power needed to run the fan must also be constant. 
Why? Because the power needed to spin a fan is proportional to the 
produced flow and the produced head.
To prove this to yourself, find the electric circuit breaker for a fan’s 
motor. The amp (amperage) meter on the circuit breaker will have a 
black needle and a red needle. The black needle indicates the actual 
current, or amp load. The red needle is the amperage load that will trip 
the motor as a result of overamping. Over time, as the tube bundle fouls 
and air flow through the bundle of a forced-draft fan is restricted, the 
black needle never moves.
An induced-draft fan (see Fig. 19.1) is a different story. As the 
tube bundle fouls,
• The air pressure to the fan drops.
• The air pressure from the discharge of the fan is just atmos-
pheric pressure. It remains constant.
• The water head (in inches) developed by the fan increases.
• The flow of air through the fan and the bundle decreases. 
This is consistent with Fig. 19.3.
• The amp load on the motor spinning the fan decreases.

Naturally, there is no reverse air flow on an induced-draft fan. That 
can occur only in a forced-draft fan. Reverse air flow can be observed 
with a forced-draft fan by seeing which portions of the screen, shown 
in Fig. 19.2, will not allow a dollar bill to stick to the underside of  
the screen.
19.3  Effect of Reduced Air Flow
Loss of air flow through a finned tube air cooler bundle is a universal 
problem. The effect is to reduce the exchanger’s cooling efficiency. To 
restore cooling, you might wish to try the “Norm Lieberman method,” 
which consists of reversing the polarity of the three-phase fan motor 
electric leads. The fan will now spin backward. Depending on the 
nature of the deposits, a portion of the accumulated dirt will be blown 
off the tubes—but all over the unit. Personnel should observe this pro-
cedure from a “safe” distance.
A more socially acceptable option is to water-wash the tubes. 
Most of the effective washing must be underneath the tubes. Washing 
from the top down is relatively ineffective. In many cases, detergent 
must be added to the washwater to remove greasy dirt. (Caution: Hot 
tubes may be thermally shocked by this washing and pull out of the 
tube header box.)
To effectively water-wash the deposits from the fins I will pro-
ceed as follows:
	
1.	 Shut off the fan.
	
2.	 Lock out the motor.
	
3.	 Tie off the fan blade with a rope to keep it from spinning in 
the wind.
	
4.	 Remove the screen.
	
5.	 Use a 0.5-inch piece of tubing as a washing wand.
	
6.	 For water, use steam condensate or boiler feed water at 50 to 
100 psig.
	
7.	 Hold the wand tip 6 to 10 inches from the bottom row of tubes.
	
8.	 Run the wand between each row of tubes individually.
This is a long, wet, hot, and dirty job, but the results are some-
times quite fantastic. Washing from the top down takes even longer, 
uses 10 times as much water, and never does a good job. But it’s a lot 
easier and drier.
The fan blades themselves may be adjusted to obtain more air 
flow. This is done by increasing the fan blade pitch. The pitch can usu-
ally be adjusted between 12° (for low air flow) to 24° (for high air 
flow). Any increase in air flow has to increase the amp load on the fan 
motor driver. The motor could then trip off.

	
A i r  C o o l e r s 	
229
Setting the blade pitch cannot be done with great precision, and 
it’s not too critical. I once increased the blade pitch from 15° to about 
22°. Air flow increased by only 5 percent measured by the increased 
amperage load on the motor driver.
Cooler weather always increases the air flow produced by a fan. 
This always increases the amp load on the fan’s motor driver. To pre-
vent the motor from tripping off, or simply to save electricity during 
the winter, you might reduce the fan blade pitch.
One factor that does not reduce air flow is crushed fins at the 
top of the tube bundle. Walking across a fin tube bundle will 
crush these fins. It looks bad, but does not appear to affect cooling 
efficiency.
Take a close look at Fig. 19.2. Note that on the right side of the 
sketch there is a small gap between the blade tip and the shroud. It is 
this gap that accounts for the air recirculation previously described. 
The bigger the gap, the greater the detrimental air recirculation. 
With age, shrouds get out of round and the gap increases, but not 
uniformly.
The only way to seal off this gap is to use strips of plastic or Teflon 
attached to the inner wall of the shroud. When the fan is turned on it 
will cut through parts of the plastic strips and create its own seal. 
Field results have been positive, and the strips, called “tip seals,” can 
be purchased as a retrofit kit from air cooler vendors.
19.4  Adjustments and Corrections to Improve Cooling
19.4.1  Adjusting Fan Speed
The revolutions per minute (rpm) (or rotational speed) of a fan can 
be increased by increasing the size of the motor pulley, which is the 
grooved wheel on the motor shaft. A small increase in the diameter 
of this pulley will greatly increase air flow through the cooling bun-
dle. But according to the affinity or fan laws, doubling the diameter 
of a pulley increases the driver amp load by 800 percent. That is, 
driver horsepower increases to the cube (third power) of the fan’s 
speed.
But there is a bigger problem than motor overload when increas-
ing a fan’s speed. The blades themselves are rated only for a maxi-
mum centrifugal force. This force increases with increased fan rpm. 
At some maximum speed, the blades fly apart. Gentle reader, you can 
imagine how I became so smart on this subject.
Belt slipping used to be a major problem on air coolers. The 
resulting low rpm routinely reduced air flow. Modern air coolers 
have notched belts, which are far less subject to belt slippage. Regard-
less, a slipping belt will result in a reduced amp load on the fan’s 
motor driver.

19.4.2  Use of Water Sprays on Air Coolers
Spraying water on fin-fan air coolers is generally not a good idea. It is 
really effective only in dry climates with low humidity. The evaporation 
of water by the dry air cools the surface of the fins; that is, the latent heat 
of vaporization of the water robs sensible heat from the tubes.
Salts or other dissolved solids in the evaporating water will plate out 
on the exterior of the tubes. With time, a serious loss in heat-transfer effi-
ciency results. Use of steam condensate can avoid this particular difficulty.
Water sprays should be used only as a stopgap measure because 
of the swell they cause in the plant’s effluent volume, and also their 
tendency to create a safety hazard in the vicinity of the cooler.
One of my clients used fire water for a few hours to cool an air 
cooler. The problem was the fire water was seawater. It proved impos-
sible to totally remove the salts from between the fins. The tube bun-
dles had to be replaced to restore efficiency.
19.4.2.1  Sweeping the Underside of an Air Cooler Tube Bundle
A finned tube bundle acts as an air filter. Air is drawn up through the 
lower two rows of fins where much of the dust, dirt, bugs, and moths 
are filtered out, and thus restricts air flow. Water-washing is the most 
effective method of removing these deposits. However, many of my 
clients will not water-wash hot air cooler bundles while running for 
fear of pulling out the tubes from the tube sheets due to thermal con-
traction of the tubes.
A quick, but rather dirty method that I’ve used to remove many 
of these deposits is to drop off the screen, turn off the fan, then lock 
out the fan and tie off the fan with a strong rope, and with a long-
handled broom, sweep off the underside of the finned tubes. This 
rather primitive technique is sometimes surprisingly effective.
19.4.2.2  Fin Deterioration
The fins are usually made out of aluminum. Especially in moist, 
steamy environments, the fins are subject to destruction by corrosion. 
A corroded fin retards rather than promotes heat transfer. It’s easy to 
break such fins off by hand. A high-pressure jet of water can be used 
to knock off the corroded fins and partly restore cooling capacity.
19.4.3  Air Cooler Fan Alignment
For forced-draft fans, I have sometimes seen that the fan assembly 
gets slightly out of true vertical alignment. One side of the fan is run-
ning a little higher than the other. The consequences of this misalign-
ment will be to increase the clearance between the fan blade tip and 
the inside of the shroud by perhaps a few inches. This increased 
blade-to-shroud clearance will promote air recirculation from the dis-
charge of the fan back to the bottom of the shroud. The net result is a 
reduction in the air flow through the finned tube bundle.

The problem can be corrected by realigning the fan assembly. 
Alternately, vane tip clearance mesh can be attached to the interior of 
the shroud, which will eliminate excessive blade-to-shroud clearance 
and thus push more cooling air through the finned tube bundle.
Alternately, the shroud itself may become distorted with age. 
This will also cause the clearance between the blade tips and the 
inside of the shroud to increase. This vane tip clearance mesh is also 
used to correct this problem, which promotes air recirculation and 
diminishes air flow through the bundle.
I’ve only used this mesh once. It came in a big roll several feet 
high and about 8 inches wide. The mesh itself was around 2 inches 
thick and screwed into the inside of the shroud. A simple tool was 
then bolted onto one blade. After that the fan was turned by hand to 
cut a groove into the mesh.
It seemed to me that air flow increased by some amount that I did 
not measure. The operators reported that cooling had been increased.
19.5  Designing for Efficiency
19.5.1  Tube-Side Construction
The mechanical construction of the tubes in an air cooler creates some 
rather nasty problems. Figure 19.4 shows the exterior appearance at 
either end of an air cooler. The small black circles are threaded steel 
plugs. They are not connected to the ends of the tubes. Allow me to 
rotate the air-cooler header box shown in Fig. 19.4 by 90° and display 
a cross-sectional view in Fig. 19.5. Note that the plugs are not con-
nected to individual tubes. Unscrewing a plug just gives one access to 
the end of a tube for cleaning purposes.
Proper cleaning of an air-cooler tube requires removing two plugs. 
A large industrial air cooler may have 2000 tubes or 4000 plugs. The 
labor involved to remove and reinstall all these plugs is formidable. 

	
232	
C h a p t e r  N i n e t e e n
Leaking plugs due to cross-threading is a common start-up problem. 
Hence, many air coolers are simply never cleaned.
The pass partition baffle shown in Fig. 19.5 makes this cooler a two-
pass exchanger. These baffles are subject to failure due to corrosion. 
More often, they break because of excessive tube-side pressure drop. 
The differential pressure across a two-pass pass partition baffle equals 
the tube-side P.
Once the pass partition baffle fails, the process fluid may bypass 
the finned tubes, and cooling efficiency is greatly reduced. This is bad. 
But worse yet, during a turnaround of the cooler, there is normally no 
way to inspect the pass partition baffle. There is no easy way to visu-
ally verify the mechanical integrity of this baffle. A few air coolers 
have removable inspection ports for this purpose; most do not.
19.5.2  Parallel Air Coolers
A large process plant air cooler may have 10, 20, 30, or more 
banks of air coolers, arranged in parallel. Figure 19.6 shows such an 
arrangement. Let’s assume that the inlet header is oversized and has 
zero pressure drop. Let’s also assume that the outlet header is over-
sized and also has no P. The pressure drop across the tube side of all 
such air coolers arranged in parallel is then identical.
If one of the air coolers begins to experience tube-side fouling, the 
fluid flow will be reduced. But the tube-side pressure drop will remain

the same. The pressure drop across all five air-cooler bundles, shown 
in Fig. 19.6, is 10 psig.
Individual flows to parallel banks of air coolers are rarely—if 
ever—measured. Regardless, we can gauge the approximate relative 
flow to each bundle. This can be done by checking the outlet tempera-
ture of the bundles or banks.
Let’s assume that the cooling air flow to all five banks is the same. 
Banks A and B in Fig. 19.6 have low outlet temperatures. Banks C, D, 
and E have much hotter outlets. Question: Which coolers are han-
dling most of the heat-transfer duty? Is it A and B or C, D, and E?
The correct answer is C, D, and E. Most of the flow is passing 
through C, D, and E. Very little flow is passing through A and B. Look 
at the combined outlet temperature from all five coolers. It is 145°F. 
This indicates that most of the total flow is coming from C, D, and E—
the banks with the higher outlet temperature. Very little of the flow is 
coming from A and B—the banks with the lower outlet temperature.
Why would the flow through A and B be so low? Apparently, 
their tubes must be partly plugged. Corrosion products, gums, and 
dust are common plugging agents. But when such exchangers foul, 
their relative tube-side P, as compared to the other exchangers, 
remains constant. But their relative tube-side flow, as compared to 
the other parallel exchangers, decreases.
19.5.2.1  Air Outlet Temperature
The individual air outlet temperatures from the coolers shown in 
Fig. 19.6 are
A: 105°F
 B: 095°F

These temperatures may be measured with a long-stem (24-inches) 
portable temperature probe. Do not touch the tip of the probe to the 
fins when making a reading. Four readings per tube bundle section 
are adequate to obtain a good average.
The ambient temperature was 85°F. The individual temperature 
rises for each air cooler would then be
A = 105°F - 85°F = 20°F
 B =   95°F - 85°F = 10°F
 C = 170°F - 85°F = 85°F
 D = 165°F - 85°F = 80°F
 E = 180°F - 85°F = 95°F
Total      =      290°F
If you are now willing to make the assumption that the air flow is 
the same through the five coolers, we could calculate the process side 
flow through each cooler. For example, percent flow through A = 
20°F/290°F = 7 percent. This calculation assumes that the percent of 
flow through the cooler is proportional to the air temperature rise 
through the cooler divided by the total air temperature rise through all 
five coolers.
It is not all that difficult to decide whether the air flow through 
identical coolers is similar. I just wave a handkerchief in the breeze at 
a few spots above the cooler.
19.5.3  Air-Cooled Condensers
In many process plants, the pump alleys are covered with forced-
draft, air-cooled condensers. Dozens of coolers are arranged in paral-
lel. I have seen services where 300 mm Btu/h of condensation duty 
was easily handled by aerial cooling. All these large systems had one 
problem in common. They all tended to have higher flows through 
cooling banks connected closest to the inlet and/or outlet headers. 
The higher relative flows were indicated by both higher air outlet and 
higher process outlet temperatures. A good example of this is shown 
in Fig. 19.6.
The mechanism that causes this often-severe flow maldistribution is 
based on low-temperature dew-point corrosion, as explained below. 
Here is a rather common example, assuming that the main corrodants are 
chlorides, in a hydrogen sulfide–rich, condensing hydrocarbon vapor:
 
1. A small amount of ammonia is injected into the overhead 
vapor line to control the pH of a downstream water draw.
	
2.	 Vapor-phase ammonium chloride is formed.
	
3.	 Tube bundles nearest the inlet header tend to see perhaps 
1 percent more flow than the tube bundles farthest from the 
inlet header.

	
A i r  C o o l e r s 	
235
	
4.	 Bundles seeing the lower flows have slightly lower outlet 
temperatures.
	
5.	 Lower temperature favors the sublimation of ammonium 
chloride vapor to a white saltlike solid.
	
6.	 This salt is very hydroscopic, meaning that it will absorb and 
condense water vapor from the flowing hydrocarbon vapor 
stream at unexpectedly high temperatures.
	
7.	 The resulting wet chloride salts are very corrosive, especially 
to carbon steel tubes.
	
8.	 A ferric chloride corrosion product is formed.
	
9.	 This metallic chloride salt then reacts with the abundant mol-
ecules of hydrogen sulfide to produce hydrochloric acid and 
iron sulfide.
	 10.	 The hydrochloric acid may then continue to promote corrosion.
	 11.	 The iron sulfide (or pyrophorric iron) accumulates as a 
blackish-gray deposit inside the tubes.
	 12.	 This deposit further restricts vapor flow through the low-
flow tubes.
	 13.	 The reduced flow causes a lower tube outlet temperature.
	 14.	 The lower tube outlet temperature promotes higher rates of 
salt sublimation from vapor to a corrosive fouling solid.
Meanwhile, the air-cooler bundles nearest the inlet header tend to 
see a greater and greater percentage of the total flow as the cooler bun-
dles foul and plug. They tend to stay hot and clean, and those bundles 
farthest from the inlet header tend to run cool and dirty.
It is a general principle of heat exchange that low flows tend 
to promote fouling and fouling promotes corrosion. The corroded, 
fouled heat-exchanger surface retards flow and creates a vicious 
cycle. We will see this problem again in shell-and-tube heat exchang-
ers, as discussed in Chap. 26.
The best way to handle the nonsymmetrical flow problem 
described previously is to make the pressure drops in both the inlet 
and outlet tube bundle headers very small, as compared to the bundle 
pressure drop itself. Many of my clients add additional tube bundles 
in parallel with existing air coolers. This helps at first, but they find 
that the long-term benefits are quite disappointing because of high 
pressure drop in the new header lines.
Slug washing individual tube bundles with steam condensate 
also helps. Washings for 20 minutes once a week are often sufficient.

CHAPTER 20
Thermodynamics
How It Applies to Process Equipment
W
hile most readers of this text will have studied thermo­
dynamics at university or while obtaining their steam 
ticket, few have understood it. That’s because it was not 
explained properly. I can and will rectify this situation in this easy-to-
read short chapter.
I will mainly be discussing water and steam. This is the working 
fluid that we on planet Earth have selected to run many of our 
machines and generate most of our electricity. The word thermo refers 
to the heat content of steam. The word dynamics refers to the velocity 
of steam:
• Thermo = Heat
• Dynamics = Velocity
20.1  Why Is Thermodynamics Important  
to the Plant Operator?
Machines are not driven by the heat of steam, but by the velocity of 
steam. Mainly, I’m referring to steam turbines used to drive pumps, 
compressors, air blowers, and electrical generators. It’s the velocity of 
the steam striking the turbine blades that causes the turbine to spin. 
The greater the velocity of the steam striking the turbine blades, the 
more work can be extracted from each pound of steam. The applica­
tion of thermodynamics in the process plant is intended to maximize 
the velocity of steam.
However, the source of steam velocity does not originate with the 
pressure of the steam, but with the heat content of the steam. Hence, 
the original text on thermodynamics was called Heat, a Mode of 
Motion. The term thermodynamics was introduced as an afterthought 
because it sounds more important.
237

	
238	
C h a p t e r  T w e n t y
20.2  The Source of Steam Velocity
Let’s assume I wish to generate 1 lb of saturated 400-psig steam in a 
boiler. I’ll be starting with a pound of water at 60°F and atmospheric 
pressure. I’ll do this in three steps and express the energy required for 
each step in Btu.
• Step One: Pump water up to 400 psig—requires about 1.2 Btu.
• Step Two: Heat water to its boiling point of about 440°F at 
400 psig—requires about 380 Btu.
• Step Three: Vaporize the water to steam—requires about 
820 Btu.
Any boiler plant operator trying to optimize steam generation 
efficiency will worry most about the firebox and convective section 
economizer, and not the boiler feed water pump. About two-thirds of 
the energy required to generate steam is devoted to latent heat and 
one-third to sensible heat. The energy needed to increase the pressure 
of the water is very small in comparison.
A hydroelectric power station generating electricity from a water­
fall requires the flow from an entire river. A coal-fired power station 
generating electricity from steam requires a small water rate that 
could flow through a 12-inch pipe. The hydroelectric station is only 
using the potential energy of the water that has been converted to 
velocity. The thermal power station is using the heat content of the 
steam that has been converted to velocity.
20.2.1  How to Convert Heat into Motion
I have two ways of expanding steam. The bad way and the good way. 
In both ways I am not changing the energy content of the steam. I am 
not extracting any work from the steam; there is no friction and no 
heat is added or lost. This is called an adiabatic expansion.
Figure 20.1(a) illustrates the bad expansion. I expand 400 psi 
steam down to atmospheric pressure by going from a small pipe to a

big pipe. That is, the cross-section area of the pipe increases to keep 
the steam velocity constant.
This sort of expansion is bad because it accomplishes nothing. 
The velocity of the steam has not increased at all. It’s called an isoen­
thalpic expansion because the heat content of the steam has not been 
reduced. None of the heat has been converted to velocity. And since 
it is the velocity—not the heat—of the steam that does work, nothing 
has been accomplished. 
It’s like taking a girl on a date to an expensive restaurant. At her 
front door, she says, “I had a wonderful time. Thanks!” What have 
you accomplished? Nothing!
20.2.2  Isoentropic Expansion
I like to call the isoenthalpic expansion a parasitic expansion because 
it wastes the potential ability of the steam to do work. On the other 
hand, we have the good isoentropic expansion that maximizes the 
ability of the expanded steam to do work. Figure 20.1(b) - Case 2, also 
illustrates this sort of good expansion.
This type of expansion is good because it increases the velocity of 
the steam. Thus, the question is, what is the source of energy needed to:
• Increase the kinetic energy of the steam?
• Accelerate the steam?
• Increase the momentum (mass times velocity) of the steam?
This energy does not come from the steam pressure but from the 
temperature of the steam. We are converting the sensible heat content 
(thermal energy) of the steam to kinetic energy.
It’s like taking a girl home from dinner and she says, “Why not 
come up for a cup of coffee?”
Comparing the two expansions in Fig. 20.1(b), the exhaust steam 
temperature has dropped from 330°F to 212°F, because the velocity 
has increased. The higher velocity steam can do more work than the 
slower steam. This single idea is the basis for the second law of ther­
modynamics, one of the fundamental principles that govern the 
dynamics of our universe.
Cooling of Steam on Expansion
When steam is reduced in pressure, while maintaining a constant 
velocity, its flowing temperature goes down. How can the steam 
temperature go down without:
•  Increasing velocity?
•  Extracting work from the steam?
•  Heat losses to the environment?

	
T h e r m o d y n a m i c s 	
241
The answer is that at a lower pressure the steam molecules move 
away from each other, which then lowers the frequency of mol­
ecules colliding with the temperature sensor. However, as the 
molecules move away from each other, the latent heat of conden­
sation stored up by the molecules increases. In effect, just lower­
ing the pressure without any change in velocity converts some of 
the sensible heat of the steam to latent heat of the steam, but 
without any effect on the heat content of the steam.
This is also true for light hydrocarbons (ethane, propane, 
butane), but not for hydrogen.
20.3  Converting Latent Heat to Velocity
Reducing steam pressure from 400 psi down to 100 psi in an isoentro­
pic manner, as shown in Fig. 20.2, will have two positive results:
• High velocity steam, at 100 ft/sec, that can do work
• One hundred psi steam that I can use to reboil distillation 
columns
But suppose I don’t wish to use the 100-psi steam and would 
simply like to exhaust the steam to the atmosphere. Then, instead of 
the steam velocity being 100 ft/sec, it might exhaust from the dis­
charge nozzle at 500 ft/sec. Where does all that extra kinetic energy 
come from?
• Some comes from a further reduction in the temperature of 
the steam. That is, the steam temperature will drop from the 
440°F supply temperature down to 212°F [see Fig. 20.1(b)].
• However, most of the extra kinetic energy of the steam 
comes, not from the sensible heat, but from the latent heat of 
the steam. To be precise, 10 percent of the steam will con­
dense to water.

C h a p t e r  T w e n t y
We can extrapolate this concept further. Suppose I exhaust the 
steam to a vacuum of perhaps 25 inches of mercury (30 inches being a 
perfect vacuum). Now about 15 percent of the steam would be con­
densed and the steam (plus condensate) velocity might be 1000 ft/sec. 
I can extract much more work from each pound of steam. Of course, 
not only don’t I have any useful steam left over, but I also have the 
expense of condensing the exhaust steam under vacuum conditions 
(see the Mollier diagram in Fig. 20.1).
It’s like the girl you have taken out to dinner asking, “What do 
you like for breakfast? Just coffee, or toast and eggs?”
(Author’s Note—The numerical values expressed above are for 
illustration only. They are not correct in an absolute sense. You may 
study these concepts and arrive at accurate conversion rates of steam 
enthalpy to kinetic energy by using the Mollier diagram in your 
steam tables. Just follow the vertical isoentropic lines down the chart 
from the motive steam conditions down to the exhaust steam condi­
tions. Note the lines of constant moisture as you drop below the satu­
rated steam envelope line.)
20.4  Effect of Wet Steam
I suppose it may seem strange that creating more condensation of 
the motive steam could allow more useful work to be extracted from 
the steam. But it was this particular observation that led James Watt 
to vastly increase the efficiency of the steam engine almost 200 years 
ago. On the other hand, moisture in the motive steam supply itself is 
bad. As the steam is expanded to a lower pressure, the moisture in 
the supply steam will evaporate and cool off the steam, thus reduc­
ing the amount of sensible heat that could be converted to steam 
velocity.
20.4.1  Momentum in Steam Turbines
A useful way of summarizing the concepts I have just related is to 
think about momentum. That is:
Momentum = Mass × Velocity
When we operate a steam turbine, we are trying to provide a 
certain amount of horsepower to drive our pump, or compressor, or 
generator. If I want to provide this power with less mass of steam,  
I need to increase the velocity of the steam. And this is done by 
extracting more sensible heat from the motive steam, and more 
importantly, more latent heat from the motive steam.
You can see quite clearly that it is not the pressure of the steam 
that is driving a turbine. Place a pressure gauge on the turbine case of 
a single-wheel machine. The pressure on the turbine case will be 
quite close to the exhaust steam pressure and certainly not the motive 
steam pressure.

20.5  Steam Ejector Temperature Profile
The entire concept of thermodynamics, the conversion of steam heat 
into steam velocity, can best be observed on a vacuum jet. Let’s say I 
have 150-psig (10-BAR) saturated steam at 360°F flowing to the jet. As 
soon as the steam enters the ejector through the steam nozzle, the 
steam cools off to about 90°F. Don’t take my word for it. Take your 
temperature gun and see for yourself. What happened to the missing 
270°F of the steam (360°F–90°F)? It was converted to velocity!
As the steam slows down through the diffusor portion of the 
jet, you would expect the steam to partially heat, back up. And it 
does, perhaps to 200°F to 250°F at the discharge of the jet (i.e., at the 
condenser) inlet.
20.6  Roto-Flow Turbo Expander
I did not understand thermodynamics at university. It seemed to be 
an exotic subject with no relevance to my future as a refinery process 
engineer. It wasn’t until I had spent many years working with steam 
turbines, surface condensers, steam distribution systems, and most 
especially vacuum ejectors that I realized that without a firm under­
standing of thermodynamics, I could not operate or troubleshoot 
such facilities with any degree of confidence.
For those of you who work in the liquefied natural gas industry, 
all of the above principles discussed relating to steam apply to light 
liquid hydrocarbons as well. The Roto-Flow Turbo Expander, which 
you use to partially liquefy the natural gas, is much the same as a 
steam turbine. That is, the motive gas is partially condensed to ethane 
and propane, as the temperature of the gas is converted to velocity, as 
the gas flows into the Roto-Flow turbine case. Much of the torque 
developed by the expander turbine is derived from the latent heat of 
condensation of the liquefied petroleum fractions.
20.7  The Meaning of Entropy
The second law of thermodynamics states that:
Change in entropy = Change in heat divided by temperature
Or
	
DS = DQ ÷ T	
(20.1)
But what does this actually mean to ordinary people? Not people 
like Einstein or Edison or Marie Curie, but to people like you and me, 
who got a D in thermo?
Entropy is a measure of the amount of heat that’s available at a 
particular temperature. Lots of entropy is really bad. Heat available at 
a low temperature, which means the heat has lots of entropy, is bad.

	
244	
C h a p t e r  T w e n t y
For example, let’s say Paulie knows 100 girls in high school. Each 
girl likes Paulie enough to smile at him in the hall. This is like having 
a large amount of heat, but it’s so diffuse that it’s almost useless. Hav­
ing lots of heat available at a low temperature means the heat is so 
spread out that we can’t do much with it. Paulie’s problem is that his 
girlfriends are suffering from excessive entropy.
On the other hand, Frank is involved with Cathy. All the other 
girls think that he’s a nerd. But Cathy meets Frank after school so that 
they can study The History of Art in Frank’s room. This is like having 
a small amount of heat, but it’s so concentrated that it’s really useful. 
Having a small amount of heat available at a really high temperature 
means the heat has only a little entropy, which is good.
Liz has just reviewed the preceding analogy and has accused me 
of “sexist stupidity.” Thus, I’ll offer a better example of entropy. Let’s 
say I’ve got 1000 Btu worth of heat in a big pot. But the temperature of 
the pot is only 68°F. It’s nice to have the heat, but at 68°F, I can’t think 
of any way to use it to make money. The problem is my pot has too 
much entropy.
Alternatively, I’ve got a tiny pot with 100 Btu of heat. The tem­
perature of this tiny pot is 2000°F. I can use this heat to:
• Make steam
• Generate electricity
• Distill wine into whiskey
All of which I can use to make money. My tiny hot pot has very 
little entropy.
Concentrating more heat in a smaller pot makes the stuff inside 
the pot hotter and reduces its entropy. And because concentrated heat 
with low entropy is easier to do things with than dilute, colder heat 
with high entropy, we say that:
“Increasing the entropy of heat reduces its ability to do work.”
Ninety-plus percent of the energy of the universe is available at 
3°K (-270°C). That’s the background radiation that contributes to 
static on your radio. This is the heat left over from the “Big Bang,” 
13½ billion years ago. But it’s useless because it’s so cold that all that 
heat has too much entropy.
A small percentage of the universe’s energy is stored inside stars 
(there are 4 × 1022) in the form of gravity and hydrogen, which can 
fuse into helium, oxygen, carbon, iron, and people. That energy is 
available at tens of millions of degrees. It’s really useful because it’s 
so hot and thus has very little entropy.
A process that takes energy in the form of heat, and just lowers its 
temperature, must increase its entropy. This is bad.
A process that takes energy in the form of heat and converts that 
heat into momentum or kinetic energy does not increase its entropy, 

	
T h e r m o d y n a m i c s 	
245
because when I reduce the kinetic energy, I would get all the heat 
back at the original temperature, provided the entire process was:
• “Reversible”
• Adiabatic 
Expanding high-pressure steam to a low pressure through a 
steam nozzle used in turbines and vacuum ejectors (see Fig. 20.3) is 
my favorite example of an isoentropic process.
Almost all of the energy needed to accelerate the steam from 100 
to 3000 ft/sec comes from cooling the steam from 350°F to 90°F. In 
an isoentropic process, the heat content of the steam decreases, and 
its entropy is constant, provided that the process is fully reversible 
(Fig. 20.2).
In an isoenthalpic process, the heat content of the steam remains 
constant and its entropy increases (Fig. 20.1).
The concept of entropy was not invented just to confuse young 
students by Herr Professor Clausis. It was intended to define the effi­
ciency of steam engines. Any portion of a steam engine that permits 
steam to expand and cool, without an equivalent increase in the 
kinetic energy of the steam, will increase the entropy of the steam and 
also reduce the steam’s ability to do useful work, such as spinning a 
turbine’s wheel or pulling a vacuum.
When I used the word, equivalent in the last sentence, I meant 
converting an amount of heat energy to speed, kinetic energy, or 
momentum.
• Thermo = Heat
• Dynamics = Speed or Motion
For me, thermodynamics means “Heat in Motion.” You can buy 
this book (by Professor John Tyndall) in paperback from Amazon. 
I have an original sixth-edition copy (1880). The full title is Heat, a 
Mode of Motion.

CHAPTER 21
Deaerators and  
Steam Systems
Generating Steam in Boilers 
and BFW Preparation
T
he one thing that almost all process and chemical plants have 
in common is steam. Steam is almost universally used to trans-
fer energy over reasonably short distances (i.e., less than a 
mile), for the following reasons:
• Steam has a high latent heat of condensation. This permits 
flowing steam to transmit about eight times more energy 
than that transmitted by a pound of butane.
• Steam is nonexplosive, and hence reasonably safe to handle.
• Steam is generated from water, which, while not free, is often 
inexpensive to obtain.
Steam is used for several purposes in a modern process plant:
• To spin turbines
• To provide process heat, mainly to reboilers and preheaters
• As a stripping medium in fractionation towers
• To increase the velocity of heavier liquid streams, typically in 
furnace tubes
• As a lift gas, to lift heavier liquids or solid catalyst streams to 
a higher elevation
• As a purge medium, to prevent pressure taps and other 
instrument connections and relief valves from plugging
If energy for either motive or heating purposes must be transmit-
ted over long distances (i.e., more than a few miles), it is best to use 
247

electricity. The energy loss (due to both friction and ambient-heat 
radiation) is orders of magnitude greater for steam as compared to 
electrical power. Most electricity is produced from steam by use of a 
steam-powered generator. Typically, it takes 3 Btu of steam to gener-
ate 1 Btu of electricity. That is why it is best to use the steam directly, 
at least for heating purposes, if the distance between the boiler house 
and the consumer is small.
21.1  Boiler Feedwater
21.1.1  Sources of Boiler Feedwater
Steam is generated from boiler feedwater. But water used for steam gen-
eration must first be purified. For example, raw water drawn from the 
Mississippi River has three objectionable contaminants:
• Sand and silt
• Dissolved solids (typically carbonates)
• Oxygen
The particulate matter (sand and silt) is removed by flowing 
upward through a gravel-and-sand filter bed. The coarser gravel is in 
the lower part of the bed. The filter beds are back-flushed periodi-
cally with clear water to clean off the accumulated mud.
The dissolved solids, such as calcium carbonates, are removed by 
hot-lime softening or demineralization.1 Demineralized water (also 
called deionized water) typically has essentially all anions and cations 
removed by ion-exchange resin. Demineralized water is preferable to 
hot-lime-softened water as boiler feedwater for several reasons.
For one thing, steam produced from hot-lime-softened water will 
have some amount of silicates. These silicates tend to deposit on the 
rotor blades of turbines, which use the motive steam as a source of 
energy. The silicate fouling of the turbine blades reduces the turbine’s 
efficiency. But, more importantly, from an operator’s point of view, 
the silicate deposits eventually break off of the blades. This unbal-
ances the rotor. An unbalanced rotor is the fundamental cause of 
vibration. Vibrations lead to damage of the shaft bearings and seals. 
Eventually, vibrations will destroy the turbine’s internal components.
Also, the hot-lime-softened water has variable amounts of car-
bonate contamination. When boiler feedwater is converted to steam, 
the carbonate deposits will break down into carbon dioxide and 
hardness deposits.
The hardness deposits coat the inside of the boiler’s tubes, inter-
fere with heat transfer, and overheat the tubes. The carbon dioxide, 
which is also generated from the dissolved solids, creates more seri-
ous corrosion problems in downstream heat exchangers. When the 

	
D e a e r a t o r s  a n d  S t e a m  S y s t e m s  	
249
steam condenses, the carbon dioxide may remain trapped in the 
reboiler or preheater as a non-condensable gas. Actually, there is no 
such thing as a non-condensable gas. Even CO2 is somewhat soluble 
in water. As the CO2 dissolves in the condensed steam, it forms 
carbonic acid, a relatively weak acid (pH typically between 5 and 6). 
Strong acids will have pH values of 1 to 2. Pure water has a pH of 7. 
Carbonic acid is corrosive to carbon steel heat-exchanger tubes.
Oxygen is a particularly reactive element. Actually, oxygen is a 
very potent gas and reacts aggressively with exposed metal surfaces 
to form oxides. Of all the corrosive substances encountered in a pro-
cess plant, few exceed oxygen in reactivity with steel pipes. If a con-
siderable amount of oxygen is left in boiler feedwater, interior corro-
sion of the boiler tubes will be rapid. The bulk of the oxygen, or 
dissolved air, is stripped out of the boiler feedwater in a deaerator.
In properly operated process plants, most of the boiler feedwater 
should be recovered condensate; that is, when steam condenses to 
water, the condensate produced should be recovered and returned to 
the boiler house. Often, the recovered condensate will first pass through 
a deoiling clay bed to remove any hydrocarbon contaminants. To cal-
culate the percent of condensate recovered, we need to know two 
numbers:
• Total steam production (SP)
• Total raw water flow (RW)
The percent condensate recovery (CR) can then be calculated:
	
=
−
×
CR
100%
100
RW
SP
	
Plants with CR >70 percent are usually doing a good job of recover-
ing condensate. CR values of <30 percent represent poor performance. 
Poor condensate recovery is expensive for two reasons. One reason is the 
energy and chemicals needed to prepare the boiler feedwater. But in 
recent years, there is a second, more expensive cost associated with poor 
condensate recovery: effluent wastewater treatment.
I well remember one Louisiana refinery in which boilers and heat 
exchangers suffered from constant steam-side corrosion and fouling. 
Investigation showed that the intake water-treatment plant operators 
would occasionally partially open the raw-water bypass around the 
entire treatment plant. They had a good reason, however, which they 
explained to me. “Norm, y’all have to admit, some kind of water is 
better than no water at all.”
21.1.2  Deaerators
Figure 21.1 is a sketch of a typical boiler feedwater deaerator. The 
lower portion of the deaerator acts as a surge vessel for the boiler 
charge pump. The working part of the deaerator is the smaller vertical 

	
250	
C h a p t e r  T w e n t y - O n e
section on top of this surge vessel. The vertical section is essentially a 
small, four-tray, steam stripper tower (see Chap. 15). Sometimes these 
trays are called mixing shelves, but their function is the same as any 
distillation tower tray: to bring the vapor (steam) into intimate contact 
with the liquid (soft water). The objective of the little tower is to drive 
off the light component (air, dissolved in the soft water) with the heav-
ier component (steam).
The deaerator shown in Fig. 21.1 is operating at 250°F. This particu-
lar temperature corresponds to the boiling point of water at 15 psig. We 
can say, then, that the temperature of the deaerator controls its pres-
sure. But it is equally correct to say that the pressure of the deaerator 
sets its temperature.
The 120°F soft water is heated to 250°F by the 50-psig heating 
steam. In most deaerators, the vast majority of the heating steam is 
condensed inside the deaerator. The heat of condensation of the 
steam is used to heat the soft water.
Usually, only a small amount of the heating steam—specifically, 
stripping steam—is vented through the restriction orifice located in the 
atmospheric vent. It is this small stripping steam flow that drives the 
air out of the soft water.
Note that the collected steam condensate does not pass through 
the little stripper section. As this stream is just condensed steam, it 
should be free of air. Hence, it does not need to be stripped.

really good process plant operators. Perhaps they find the work less 
hazardous. Big Jim became an operator at the utility complex for a 
major New Orleans–area sugar refinery. Here is a rather neat problem 
that Jim and I solved together.
The problem was cavitation of the high-pressure boiler feedwa-
ter charge pump, shown in Fig. 21.1. Such pumps are often multi-
stage. This means that there are three or four pump impellers on a 
relatively long shaft. The longer the pump shaft, the greater the 
damage caused by vibration to the pump support bearings and 
mechanical seal. Cavitation is certainly the leading cause of vibra-
tion in centrifugal pump operation (see Chap. 36). The cause of 
cavitation in this case was loss of liquid level in the deaerator surge 
or water storage vessel.
The symptoms of the problem Jim described to me were as follows:
 
1. An operator working at the main boiler would open the 
boiler’s blowdown valve. Some lime-softened water, about 
10 percent of the boiler’s total feedwater must be drained to 
maintain the total dissolved-solids (TDS) content of the 
boiler’s circulating water below a safe maximum.
	
2.	 This would draw water out of the deaerator vessel.
	
3.	 The level in the deaerator would fall, and the flow of 120°F 
soft water into the deaerator would increase.
 
4. Suddenly, the flow of softened water would increase expo-
nentially. The level-control valve would rapidly open. Yet, 
the level in the deaerator would slowly continue to fall until 
the pump lost suction and cavitated.
Jim and I then made the following field observations:
 
1. When the flow of softened water exceeded 80,000 lb/h, the 
heating steam pressure-control valve, shown in Fig. 21.1, 
would open to 100 percent.
 
2. A further increase in softened water flow drove the deaerator 
pressure down. This happened because the deaerator tem-
perature also dropped.
	
3.	 Suddenly, the atmospheric vent pipe, which had been vent-
ing steam, started to blow out rather large quantities of water 
with the steam.
	
4.	 This removed some of the water from the boiler feed surge 
drum portion of the deaerator.
 
5. As the deaerator water level fell, the 120°F softened-water 
flow increased.
	
6.	 The escalating flow of colder softened water cooled down 
the deaerator.

	
252	
C h a p t e r  T w e n t y - O n e
	
7.	 Since the water in the deaerator must always be at its boiling 
point, the reduction in the deaerator temperature resulted in 
a reduction in the deaerator pressure.
 
8. The reduced deaerator pressure coincided with an increase in 
water jetting out of the atmospheric vent.
What was happening?
Well, we have already discussed this phenomenon in Chap. 3 in 
the section on tray flooding. Water carry-over from the top of tray 1, 
as shown in Fig. 21.1, is simply a clear signal that our little four-tray 
distillation tower is flooding. But what is causing the trays to flood?
Trays usually flood because of excessive vapor flow. The vapor 
flowing to tray 4 is essentially the heating steam flow. Certainly, 
most of this steam condenses on the trays, as the heating steam 
comes into contact with the 120°F softened water. It takes about 1 lb 
of 50-psig steam to heat 7 lb of water from 120 to 250°F. The uncon-
densed steam is then vented from the top of our tower through the 
atmospheric vent. But the full steam flow, from the pressure-control 
valve, does flow up through tray 4. Obviously, when this pressure-
control valve is 100 percent open, the weight of vapor flow to tray 4 
is at its maximum.
But, dear reader, do not forget that when the steam inlet pressure-
control valve is 100 percent open, any further increase of cool sof-
tened-water flow will suppress the deaerator’s pressure. When the 
pressure of a vapor goes down, its volume goes up:
	
Volume
1
Pressure
∼
	
And when the volume of a vapor flowing through a tray increases, 
so does its velocity. Any increase in vapor velocity through a tray 
results in higher tray pressure drop. And what is it that causes trays 
to flood? Why, it is high tray deck pressure drop.
To solve this problem, Jim recommended to his boss that the 
softened water be preheated by using it on one side of a heat 
exchanger to cool off a waste foul liquor stream that was flowing 
to the effluent treatment pond. This heated the softened water 
from 120 to 160°F. The 50-psig steam demand was reduced by 
25 percent. This reduced steam flow prevented the trays from 
flooding.
Note that it is okay to heat softened or demineralized water to 
160°F. You should not, however, do this with raw water. Calcium car-
bonate salts will plate out and foul the heat-exchanger tubes.
I rather like this problem. It illustrates how knowledge of one 
type of process equipment (a distillation tower) can help us under-
stand problems in a piece of equipment that is superficially quite a 
bit different.

21.2  Boilers
A rather typical boiler is shown in Fig. 21.2. This is the sort of boiler 
one might rent to generate 50,000 lb/h of 150-psig steam. Inciden-
tally, rented process equipment does not have to be returned to the 
owner if the plant files for bankruptcy. But that is another story.
The boiler shown in Fig. 21.2 relies on natural circulation. The den-
sity difference between the water plus steam in the downflow pipes 
and the riser pipes causes the water to circulate through the pipes. A 
typical circulation rate results in 10 to 15 percent of the water flow 
being vaporized into steam. The produced steam flows from the 
steam drum into the steam header. The water level in the steam drum 
is maintained by the makeup boiler feedwater valve.
A certain amount of water is drained from the mud drum. The 
amount of this blowdown is determined by measuring the TDS in the 
steam drum. Typically, a target of several thousand parts per million 
(ppm) of TDS is specified. If the steam is generated at a low pressure 
(150 psig) for use in reboilers, rather high TDS may be acceptable. If 
the steam is generated at a high pressure (1400 psig) for use in high-
speed turbines, a much lower TDS target would be set.
It is really the quality of the treated boiler feedwater that sets the 
blowdown rate. Deionized or demineralized water might require a 
1 to 2 percent blowdown rate. Hot-lime-softened water might require 
a 10 to 20 percent blowdown rate.
The amount of hardness deposits and silicates in steam is a 
function of entrainment of water, as well as the TDS of the boiler

feedwater. A well-designed boiler, then, often is equipped with a 
mesh-type demister pad to remove entrainment from the produced 
steam.
The water level in the steam drum in Fig. 21.2 controls the boiler 
feedwater (BFW) makeup rate. However, note that the steam drum is 
full of boiling water. How can we measure the real level of this two-
phase mixture in the steam drum?
After all, the external level indication chamber (level-trol) holds 
just water. When we look at the gauge glass, it has water, not steam. 
Hence, the indicated water level outside the drum is less than the 
boiling water level inside the drum. This discrepancy causes water 
carry-over with the steam due to high boiling water levels.
If we are superheating the steam, then the silicates and other 
salts in the entrained water will deposit inside the superheater tubes. 
What I’ve just described is the leading cause of superheat tube 
failure. Most of the trouble can be avoided if you understand that 
the actual level inside the steam drum is higher than the external 
water indication shows.
I’ve explained this matter in greater detail in the section on waste-
heat boilers (Sec. 21.2.2).
21.2.1  Superheaters and Economizers
Figure 21.2 is not a complete picture of a larger industrial-type 
boiler. Mainly, it does not show the superheat and economizer tubes. 
Figure 21.3 gives a better idea of the relative arrangement of the 
steam-generating tubes, superheat tubes, and economizer tubes.
Let’s assume that we are generating 100,000 lb/h of 150-psig steam. 
In the economizer section, the effluent from the deaerator, at 250°F, would 
be heated to 350°F. As the specific heat of water is 1.0 Btu/[(lb)(°F)], we 
would need 100 Btu/lb of water. However, to produce 100,000 lb of 
steam, we might need a 10 percent blowdown rate to control TDS. This 
means 110,000 lb/h of boiler feedwater is needed. Therefore, the econo-
mizer heat duty would be
110,000 lb/h × 100 Btu/lb = 11,000,000 Btu/h
The latent heat of vaporization of 150-psig steam is roughly 
880 Btu/lb. Therefore, the steam-generation section heat duty would be
100,000 lb/h × 880 Btu/lb = 88,000,000 Btu/h
The specific heat of steam is 0.5 Btu/[(lb)(°F)]. As shown in Fig. 21.3, 
the saturated steam will be superheated from 360 to 680°F. Or, we 
may say that the steam superheat will be 320°F. We would then need 
160 Btu/lb. Hence, the superheater section heat duty would be
100,000 lb/h × 160,000 Btu/lb = 16,000,000 Btu/h

The total boiler heat duty would be the sum of the economizer, 
generation, and superheat sections, or 115,000,000 Btu/h.
I have noted that the stack flue-gas temperature of the boiler is 
680°F. Let’s assume that we have around 3 percent oxygen in the flue 
gas (or about 15 percent excess air). We can then apply the following 
rule of thumb: For every 300°F that the flue-gas temperature exceeds the 
ambient air temperature, the boiler efficiency drops by 10 percent.
If our ambient air temperature is 80°F, then our boiler efficiency is 
80 percent. The fuel consumed in our boiler is then

21.2.2  Waste-Heat Boilers
Probably only 20 percent of process plant operators or engineers ever 
work on the sort of boilers shown in Figs. 21.2 and 21.3. However, 
90 percent of process plant personnel will, at one time or another, in 
all likelihood operate a waste-heat boiler. In many petroleum refineries 
and chemical plants, most of the plant’s steam is generated in such 
waste-heat boilers. One of the most common such boilers is the kettle 
boiler, shown in Fig. 21.4.
The hot oil to the kettle boiler is a circulating pumparound 
stream from a fluid catalytic cracker fractionator, slurry-oil circuit. 
There is a fundamental difference between this sort of boiler and the 
utility plant boilers discussed previously. In the kettle boiler, the 
heating medium is inside, rather than outside, the tubes. To obtain 
the full capacity of the kettle boiler, the uppermost tubes should be 
submerged in boiler feedwater. This requirement creates a few 
problems.
First, note the water level in the level indicator shown in Fig. 21.4. 
It looks quite a bit lower than the water level inside the kettle. Why? 
Well, because the water inside the kettle is boiling water. The water 
density has been reduced by the bubbles of steam. I have discussed this 
problem in great detail in Chap. 10 in the section on level control. Basi-
cally, the difficulty is that the water in the level indicator has a specific 
gravity of about 1.0. The boiling water in the kettle has a specific grav-
ity of perhaps 0.5. If we have 4 ft of boiling water in the kettle, then, by 
pressure balance, we will have 2 ft of cool water in the level indicator.
To compensate for this problem, the top tube of the tube bundle 
should be kept well below the top of the kettle. This also will help 
retard entrainment of boiler feedwater in the steam.

To further improve the steam quality, the experienced design 
engineer places a dome, as shown in Fig. 21.4, on top of the kettle. 
The dome will have a sloped demister mesh pad. A demister acts to 
coalesce small droplets of water into larger droplets. The larger drop-
lets easily settle out of the flowing steam. The demister is sloped to 
promote liquid drainage from the surface of the pad.
Of course, if the steam from the kettle will be used to reboil some 
nearby column, entrainment is not a major problem. If the steam is 
going into superheater tubes, however, serious entrainment will lead 
to solid deposits inside the superheater tubes, and this may cause these 
tubes to overheat and fail. Fouling of turbine blades would also result.
21.2.3  Identifying Waste-Heat Boiler Tube Leaks
Fig. 21.5 shows two waste-heat boilers that are generating super-
heated, 150-psig steam from a fractionator hot oil pumparound. After 
years of trouble-free operations, water was observed in the gas-oil 
pumparound return stream. The symptoms of the water infiltration 
into the fractionator were an increase in the fractionator pressure and 
an increase in the water production from the fractionator reflux 
drum’s draw-off boot.

C h a p t e r  T w e n t y - O n e
The operators planned to bypass boilers A and B in turn, as shown 
in Fig. 21.5, to determine which boiler had a tube leak. Boiler A was 
arbitrarily selected. The hot gas-oil pumparound from the fractionator 
was closed. With the reduction in the gas-oil pumparound heat 
removal, the generation of 150-psig steam dropped in half, and the 
water intrusion into the fractionator stopped. The operators con-
cluded that with waste-heat boiler A out of service, and the water leak 
into the fractionator apparently eliminated, the leaking boiler was A.
However, when boiler A was hydrotested by the maintenance 
department, no leak was found. So boiler A was returned to service. But, 
as the operators restored the flow of gas oil to boiler A, the indications of 
water intrusion into the fractionator returned. The operators, quite angry, 
again removed boiler A out of service and insisted that the maintenance 
department this time find and actually fix the tube leak in boiler A.
This scenario was repeated three times, until the plant manager 
intervened and instructed the engineering department to purchase a 
new $250,000 tube bundle for boiler A. The refinery had lost $100,000 
per day in production for about 40 days, up to the day that the new 
tube bundle arrived. The new bundle was quickly installed. As the 
gas-oil pumparound flow was restreamed, the flow of water into the 
fractionator was once again initiated.
Can you see the problem? It’s a failure in applied logic. Boiler A 
was never leaking. All along, it was boiler B that leaked. Here’s what 
had happened:
• When boiler A was removed from service, the steam flow 
from the steam drum dropped by 50 percent.
• The ΔP through the superheat coil, shown in Fig. 21.5, 
dropped from 30 psi to:
• (½)2 . (30) = 7½ psi (i.e., ΔP varies with the flow squared).
• The pressure in the steam drum then fell from 180 psig to:
• 150 + 7½ = 157½ psig (i.e., the pressure of the 150 psig plus 
the superheat coil ΔP).
• The pressure in the steam drum fell below the 160 psig pres-
sure of the gas-oil pumparound return.
• The leak of water into the gas oil stopped. The leak reversed 
and became a small leak of gas oil into the steam drum. 
• Whenever boiler A was returned to service, the extra steam 
flow repressurized the steam drum, above the pressure of the 
gas oil, and thus restored the water leak into the gas oil.
Liz and I did find that the steam was contaminated with gas oil 
whenever the waste-heat boiler B was in service with boiler A off-
line. We put boiler A back online again, and the water reappeared in 
the fractionator, as it had on the four prior occasions. However, we 

	
D e a e r a t o r s  a n d  S t e a m  S y s t e m s  	
259
now had boiler B isolated, but left boiler A online, with no resulting 
oil contamination of the 150-psig steam and with no water contami-
nation of the gas-oil pumparound. A tube leak was found and fixed 
in boiler B, and then boiler B was also returned to service and the full 
unit charge rate was restored.
Liz and I solved this problem in just four hours, while my client 
failed to solve the problem in 40 days. One key observation we made 
was the oil contamination of the steam at the steam sample point 
shown in Fig. 21.5, when only the boiler B was in operation. The sec-
ond observation we made was that the steam drum pressure increased 
above the gas-oil pumparound pressure, when both boilers were in 
service together.
This story illustrates the importance of making direct field obser-
vations. The relevant pressure gauges and samples were not avail-
able until Liz and I showed up onsite and asked that they be installed. 
It also illustrates an even more important principle of taking an ana-
lytical approach to problem solving. That is, all possible contribu-
tions to a problem need to be considered. Then field observations 
should be made to confirm or refute the existence of each problem.
21.3  Convective Section Waste-Heat Steam Generation
Figure 21.6 shows another common form of steam generation from 
waste heat. Boiler feedwater is circulated, via a pump, through the con-
vective tubes of a fired heater. Most of the heat released by the fuel

(50 to 70 percent) is absorbed in the process coils. Perhaps 10 to 
25 percent of the waste heat in the flue gas is absorbed in the steam-
generation coils. It is good design and operating practice to keep the 
percent of water vaporized in the steam-generating coils to well less 
than 50 percent. Higher rates of vaporization promote the laydown of 
salts inside the convective tubes. Low water circulation rates will lead 
to tube leaks.
It is probably best to consume steam generated in small waste-heat 
boilers locally in steam reboilers and preheaters. Turbine drivers are 
best powered by boiler-house steam, where steam quality is more 
closely monitored and controlled.

CHAPTER 22
Steam Generation
A
n important feature of steam generation in a process plant 
is steam condensate recovery. This is usually a function of 
proper design of the steam-condensate controls on indi-
vidual steam heaters and reboilers, as well as proper design on the 
condensate recovery system, as discussed in previous chapters. 
I’ve also dealt with this subject in great detail in my book, Process 
Equipment Malfunctions (McGraw-Hill, 2010).
In my experience, a reasonably good condensate recovery rate in 
a large, complex refinery is 70 percent. A substantial portion of the 
steam is used for process steam stripping, purging vessels, instru-
ment connections, flare dispersal, and other nonrecoverable uses. 
Thus, the 70 percent rate is really rather good.
On the other hand, 30 percent condensate recovery as a percent-
age of the steam generation rate is rather bad and represents sloppy 
operations and bad condensate recovery design practices. Very 
approximately, 10 percent of the cost of steam generation could be 
saved by recovering the condensate. The condensate contains few 
silicates, thus no blowdown (explained below) is needed, no chemi-
cal treatment or deaeration is required, and no energy that would 
otherwise be used to preheat the boiler feedwater will be wasted.
22.1  Boiler Blowdown Rate
Although boiler feedwater (BFW) has been treated to remove miner-
als, residual contaminates (carbonates, silicates) are still present. 
These minerals, especially the silicates, are bad, as to some extent 
they are going to be entrained into the generated steam. The biggest 
problems with entrained silicates (TDS—Total Dissolved Solids) are:
• Drying out on the steam superheat coils, which then fail due to 
localized overheating, which results in superheat tube failure.
• Depositing on turbine blades. The deposits eventually get so 
thick that they break off and unbalance the rotor. Resulting 
vibrations then cause the turbine to trip-off, and stress corro-
sion of the blades causing sudden failure.
• Fouling of vacuum system ejector steam nozzles.
261

The TDS content of BFW should be minimized by upstream treat-
ing. In former days, hot lime water softening was employed. In most 
modern process units, ion exchange resin is used to demineralize 
BFW. “Blowdown” is the water that is drained out of the boiler to 
control the accumulations of TDS or silicates in the boiler. My old 
design value for this flow was 10 percent of the makeup BFW flow. 
Two types of blowdown from a boiler are used: continuous blow-
down from the steam drum, and intermittent blowdown from the 
mud drum; both will reduce silica. Note that with the continuous 
blowdown, heat recovery equipment may be economically justified.
Continuous Blowdown—This blowdown water is best not drained 
from the very bottom of the steam drum. The concentration of sili-
cates is 10 times higher at the steam-water interface than it is at the 
bottom of the steam drum. I’ve made the mistake in designing waste-
heat kettle-type boilers of locating the drain on the bottom of the 
kettle, which is wrong for the same reason. The correct drain location 
is somewhat below the minimum water level in the boiler steam 
drum, or in the kettle-type boiler. TDS in the blowdown is based on 
what the steam will be used for. A typical value is 1500 ppm. If steam 
from a kettle waste-heat boiler will be used saturated, for heating, 
reboiling, or stripping, then the TDS content of the steam is not par-
ticularly critical. If steam is used to drive turbines or will be super-
heated, then the TDS content of the steam is quite important. A good 
target for silica is 0.02 mg/l silica in steam used for turbines or for a 
boiler operating from 300-psig to 600-psig 0.4 total caustic alkalinity 
as mg/l of SiO2 in BFW.
Intermittent Blowdown—This blowdown from the mud drum of a 
boiler is usually once a shift via manually operated valve. If this is 
automated it is important to have the valve full open for short peri-
ods to keep the valve clear and unblocked.
22.2  Types of Steam-Generating Equipment
Figures 22.1, 22.2, and 22.3 illustrate the three types of steam-
generating equipment that are used in process plants. Most process 
units do not have the boiler shown in Fig. 22.1. Water flows via ther-
mosyphon circulation (i.e., the density difference between the steam 
drum and the mud drum). This is the kind of design used for a large 
boiler of the type found in the Utilities Department of a refinery or 
power plant.
Figure 22.2 is a convective section heat-recovery forced-circulation 
boiler. Many process-fired heaters have this feature. Hot flue gas 
from the radiant section is exchanged against BFW to make steam. A 
good water circulation rate is 10 times higher than the steam genera-
tion rate. Vaporizing 20 percent of the circulating water is still okay. 
Vaporization rates above this level will eventually cause convective 
section tube failures, as will even very short pump outages.

Figure 22.3 is the very common kettle-type waste-heat recovery 
boiler. There is no water circulation. The tubes must be covered by 
water at all times. Allowing the upper rows of tubes to be uncovered 
will lead to uneven thermal expansion of the tube bundle and dam-
age due to distortion of the uncovered tubes. If the BFW level is too 
high, this will cause water and silicate carry-over into the evolved 
steam. This sort of carry-over leads to more steam turbine vibration 
failures than any other cause. It’s one of the major problems in the 
process industry.
22.2.1  Controlling Steam Drum Levels
Ordinary level control does not work in steam drums or kettle boilers. 
The problem is the lower density of the boiling water as compared to 
the greater density of the non-boiling hot water in the external level 
sensing chamber. I’ve addressed this problem in my book, Trouble-
shooting Process Plant Control (Wiley, 2009).
The boiling water will be at a 10 to 50 percent higher level inside 
the steam drum than the water in the level-sensing chamber or gauge 
glass. There are two ways of dealing with this problem:
	
1.	 The conventional method is to get a sample of steam conden-
sate and measure it for TDS. If the blowdown water has a 
TDS of 1000 ppm and the sample has a TDS of 30 ppm, then 
the moisture content of the steam is 3 weight percent. The 
assumption is that the TDS is totally due to entrainment.

2.	 My method (which hopefully you will agree is better) is 
explained in Fig. 22.4:
• Assume initially the 400-psig steam is dry but saturated at 
450°F.
• Depressuring this steam through valve A will reduce the 
steam temperature to approximately 360°F.
• As the boiling water level rises and entrains into the 
10-inch steam line, the temperature of the vented steam at 
T1 drops to 300°F.
• Latent heat of water = 1000 Btu/lb.
• Specific heat of steam = 0.5 Btu/lb/°F.
• Therefore the water content of the 400-psig steam:
	
(360°F - 300°F) × 0.5 ÷ 1000 = 3 wt %	
Three weight percent water in steam is a lot, and would be con-
sidered to be poor-quality steam.
22.2.2  Superheating Steam
I’ve had some very bad experiences with superheating steam furnace 
convective tube failures. The cause of tube failure was overheating of 
the tubes due to hardness deposits precipitated from poor-quality 
steam. The convective section tubes will typically be carbon steel, 
which fails at about 1000°F.
The one case I have in mind occurred at a large refinery in 
northern Spain. I had supplied the retrofit design for their crude

unit distillation tower fractionation trays. The start-up went well 
and my new tray design worked fine—for two days. Then the fur-
nace steam superheat coil failed and the unit was shut down. 
During the second start-up, the operators inadvertently filled the 
tower to the top with crude oil and damaged all the trays. The tower 
would no longer fractionate. I was blamed for a poor tray design.
The worst part about the whole incident is not that I was blamed 
for my client’s operating errors. It was that the steam was being super-
heated for no purpose. All of the steam was being used for hydrocar-
bon product stripping, where steam superheat is not important.
For example:
• Product stripped is 450°F gas-oil
• Steam rate = 2 wt % on feed
• Superheated steam = 650°F
• Specific heat of steam = 0.5 Btu/lb/°F
• Specific heat of gas-oil = 0.65 Btu/lb/°F
Therefore, the temperature increase of the gas-oil due to the 
superheated steam is:
	
(650°F – 450°F) × 2% × (0.5/0.65) = 3°F	
The 3°F is hardly worth the investment in the superheat coil.
Superheating steam for reboilers and steam heaters is mostly a 
waste, as it’s a standard industry practice to inject condensate into the 
steam to bring the steam back to its saturation temperature. Super-
heated steam does not transfer heat as well as saturated steam. Hence, 
the de-superheating stations. As there is typically another convective 
section (usually BFW preheat) above the steam superheat tubes, no 
net energy savings result from steam superheat.
The maximum allowable superheat coil outlet temperature is 
700°F to protect the carbon steel tubes from failure. At low steam gen-
eration rates, I have seen furnace firing rates and thus heater charge 
rates reduced to keep from overheating the steam above 700°F. If the 
steam is not used eventually to drive turbines, or as a reactant in a 
catalytic process (steam-methane reformer for H2 or NH3 produc-
tion), then the heater capacity is being limited for no logical reason.
22.3  Boiler Feed Water Preparation
22.3.1  Condensate Polishing
The recovered steam condensate may often be contaminated with oil. 
As the condensate will flow into the lower portion of the deaerator, 
this possible oil contamination must be removed to protect the boiler 

	
S t e a m  G e n e r a t i o n 	
267
tubes from the formation of non-wetable films on the heat transfer 
surfaces which interfere with the detachment of bubbles so that the 
boiler tube surface is then not sufficiently cooled by boiler water thus 
causing severe corrosion and tube failure.
Low-level oil contamination (5 mg/l) can be removed by passing 
the condensate through clay, or diatomaceous earth, either as a bed 
supported by anthracite, or diatomaceous earth precoat filters sup-
ported by filter paper, porous stone, or wire cloth etc. In addition, a 
small amount of earth is fed continuously with incoming condensate 
at the filter inlet. The filter cake is later removed by back washing and 
rinsing. 
Condensate with heavy oil contamination can first be treated by 
oil skimming or settling, or otherwise must be simply sent to the 
effluent treating facility.
Note that although it is beneficial to keep condensate hot in the 
condensate recovery system so as to reduce the solubility of air and 
oxygen (dissolved oxygen being a major cause of corrosion in conden-
sate piping systems), oil is easier to remove from condensate when it 
is cool. Thus cold boiler feedwater is often used to cool the condensate 
stream, or air cooling is also sometimes used. Oil settling operations 
are best carried out below 100°F. Although skimmers and diatoma-
ceous earth precoat filters can operate at higher temperatures (e.g., 
175°F), the temperature limit is usually based on the temperature at 
which silica dissolves. Incidentally, the typical optimum pH of water 
in a boiler is close to 9 to retard boiler tube corrosion (see Fig. 22.5).
22.3.2  Coordinated Phosphate-pH Boiler Water Treatment
Liz described an archaic form of boiler feedwater treatment that had 
saved the day for the utility plant in the refinery where she had been 
working when the refinery demineralization plant froze one winter 
resulting in seriously restricted flow and a great shortage of boiler 
feedwater. The technique and chemistry is described by a paper writ-
ten by George Gibson (Betz)¹; although according to Mr. Gibson, it 
was apparently first introduced in 1942 by SF Whirl & TE Purcell of 
the Duquesne Light Company.
Liz says that they were able to treat raw city water and add it to 
the treated water for boiler feedwater simply by following the operat-
ing guidelines set by the coordinated phosphate-pH control chart. It 
works by causing hardness salts to be precipitated out as free-flowing 
sludge (calcium as phosphate, magnesium as hydroxide or silicate). 
This is achieved by continual additions of sodium phosphate and 
maintenance of pH within guidelines as set by the coordinated phos-
phate-pH control operating envelope which depends on the operat-
ing pressure of the boiler for which the feedwater is required. The 
alkalinity pH is adjusted by additions of sodium carbonate or sodium 
hydroxide.

22.3.3  Demineralization of BFW
The main advantages of cation-anion ion exchanger resin demineral-
ization over phosphate treating or hot-lime softening of boiler feed-
water is the superior reduction of silicates in steam. Silicates deposited 
on steam turbine blades may lead to a loss of turbine efficiency and 
vibration, and also stress corrosion, and sudden failure of the blades.
Such a “demin” plant consists of a cation exchanger resin bed fol-
lowed by an anion exchanger resin bed. These resins look like small 
yellowish plastic beads and remind me of fish eggs (see Fig. 22.5).
The raw water flows downward through the cation exchange resin 
bed, where the metallic ions are removed. Then, in a typical installa-
tion, the partly treated water flows into a large degassing vessel.

Next, the water flows downward through the anion exchanger resin 
bed, where the silicates and carbonates and other such anions are 
removed.
Periodically, the resins have to be regenerated to strip out the 
absorbed ions. The regeneration solution (dilute acid for a cation bed, 
dilute alkali for an anion bed) flows in an upward direction. This is 
followed by a rinse step using treated water. Completion of the rinse 
is typically monitored by conductivity probes. The arrangement in 
Fig. 22.5 shows the operation of these resin beds in pairs. Basically, 
this means that six vessels are in service at a given time, but each pair 
is at a different stage in the cycle:
• Two absorbing ions (anions and cations)
• Two in regeneration mode
• Two in rinsing mode
It is important to avoid stirring up the resin during the regenera-
tion step. The main objective of the regeneration step is to leave the 
purest resin at the bottom of the vessel. This will then “polish” the 
downflowing water when the bed is returned to its ion exchange ser-
vice. A slight back-pressure, using air, is typically employed at the top 
of the beds to hold the little beads in place during regeneration, and 
works best after first draining the bed down by about 1 ft below the 
top of the resin bed.
It is also possible to lose the beads from the ion exchange vessels 
during the regeneration and washing steps, if the resin beds are not 
“held down” properly during this step.
Improper demineralization will also leave carbonates in the BFW. 
These carbonates will break down in the boiler to produce CO2. The 
CO2 contaminates the steam supply to reboilers, where it is trapped. 
The CO2 accumulates and dissolves in the steam condensate to pro-
duce corrosive carbonic acid, resulting in tube failure in the reboiler 
tube bundle.
22.4  Effect of Air Preheat on Boiler Capacity
One of the first questions that my coauthor, Liz, asked me at one of 
my seminars was:
“My utility plant operators have observed that when they preheat 
their boiler combustion air from 20°C to 220°C, steam production drops 
by around 3 or 4 percent. They are forced to reduce the firing rate, 
because the radiant section of the boiler starts to overheat. With the radi-
ant section just as hot with or without the air preheat, I would think that 
steam production would remain constant, so why would it drop off?”
The answer to Liz’s question was that air preheat requires less 
fuel gas firing, and thus, less flue gas and hence less heat pickup in

C h a p t e r  T w e n t y - T w o
the convective section. While the radiant section heat transfer rate 
will remain constant, the heat transfer rate in the convective section 
will drop in proportion to the reduced fuel gas fired. A 200°C 
(220°C-20°C) of air preheat will save 10 percent of the fuel and thus 
reduce the flue gas flow by the same 10 percent. As the convective 
section duty is typically 30 percent of the total boiler duty, a 10 per-
cent reduction in the flue gas rate will reduce total boiler steam pro-
duction by:
	
30% × 10% = 3%	
Of course, I reminded Liz that she was also saving 10 percent of 
the fuel gas consumed for each pound of steam production, so per-
haps the 3 percent boiler capacity reduction was acceptable.
“Liz,” I concluded, “That 3 percent is the price we have to pay for 
energy savings. Combustion air preheat in boilers, which are limited 
by excessive radiant section temperature or hot tubes, will always 
lose steam production capacity due to the air preheater.”
22.4.1  Adjusting Excess O2
At the Tenneco Oil Refinery in New Orleans, I first learned how to 
optimize the excess oxygen content of the flue gas from a boiler. The 
fired boiler was equipped with a forced-draft (FD) fan. Due to 
mechanical deficiencies of the FD blower, the combustion air supply 
was limited, but constant. The boiler produced 650-psig steam, which 
was in short supply in the refinery. Hence, the boiler was operated to 
maximize steam production.
The utility plant operators would routinely adjust the fuel gas 
supply to maximize steam production. There was an accurate oxygen 
analyzer on the flue gas stack. It typically recorded “SEVERAL” per-
cent oxygen in the boiler’s stack. However, this O2 value was ignored, 
and correctly so, by the operators. They simply adjusted the fuel-gas 
rate, which had a variable heating value, to maximize steam produc-
tion with a fixed amount of combustion air.
If, on the other hand, they had been trying to produce a fixed 
amount of steam, then they would have adjusted the air flow to mini-
mize fuel-gas consumption in the boiler.
The reader will note that I emphasized the word “SEVERAL,” 
rather than stating a target O2 range in this example. There is no such 
range. The optimum O2 in the stack is whatever it is to maximize 
steam production. Which means, the O2 analyzer served no function 
in the control of this boiler. And that statement is, in general, true.
22.5  Deaerator Operation
Being born on Earth, I grew up unaware of the true nature of oxygen. 
Submerged in a sea of N2 and O2, I was ignorant of how unique oxygen 
is in the universe as a whole. Except on our home planet, oxygen does 

	
S t e a m  G e n e r a t i o n 	
271
not exist in its free state. It’s combined with H2, carbon, or sulfur. As a 
young process engineer, I was surprised to learn that oxygen is a 
terribly corrosive element. It must be precluded from most process 
environments, otherwise product degradation and corrosion will result.
In particular, all O2 must be removed from BFW. This is done either 
with a chemical O2 scavenger or with steam stripping. Stripping air 
out of BFW is relatively inexpensive compared to the use of chemicals.
A deaerator (Fig. 22.6) is used to remove oxygen. The more effi-
cient the deaerator, the less scavenger chemical treatment is required. 
Residual O2 in the deaerator effluent BFW is determined by a field 
titration kit, and the oxygen scavenger chemical addition rate is 
adjusted accordingly.
The steam and cold deaerator makeup water mix in the small 
stripping section shown in Fig. 22.6. Most of the steam condenses 
(typically 90 percent) to heat the cold water (120°F) to its boiling point 
temperature (250°F) at the deaearator operating pressure of 15 psig. 
The rest is vented to the atmosphere. This vented steam is being used 
to strip out the residual O2 in the cold-water feed.
Note that there is sometimes a second, hotter feed to the deaera-
tor, in addition to the cold-water feed to the stripping section. This 
secondary feed is steam condensate, which having already been 
steam, bypasses the stripping section. The exception to this general-
ization is steam condensate recovered from turbine exhaust vacuum

surface condensers. Such condensate may have been in contact with 
air that has been drawn into the surface condenser shell and thus may 
have to be deaerated again. As noted above, liquid hydrocarbons 
must be removed by a clay polishing step to prevent oil accumulation 
in the deaerator, or laydown of a nonwettable film on boiler tubes.
In the event that there is too much residual oxygen in the deaera-
tor effluent, the flow of vented steam from the top of the deaerator 
should be opened. However, often there is no vent valve, but just a 
fixed orifice vent. Or perhaps the supply steam control valve is 100 
percent open. I had the latter problem at the Coastal Refinery in 
Aruba. The refinery was spending a small fortune on the oxygen 
scavenger chemical, pyridine. All I did was to lower the deaerator set 
point pressure from 18 to 13 psig, and the residual oxygen in the 
effluent BFW dropped by an order of magnitude.
I still recall how the formerly friendly chemical sales vendor sud-
denly became cold and hostile. And then canceled his luncheon invi-
tation. It was worth the loss of the free lunch, however, to save the 
oxygen scavenger chemical costs.
As I’ve described in my book, Troubleshooting Process Plant Con-
trol, any time the steam inlet control valve becomes fully open, the 
deaerator temperature, pressure, and water level will become unsta-
ble and the deaerator stripping section will flood. Flood in the sense 
that boiling water may erupt from the atmospheric vent.
22.6  Boiler Feedwater Preheat
The optimum feed temperature to a deaerator is the boiling point of 
water at the deaerator pressure. Typically, 230°F to 240°F. However, in 
many of the plants, BFW to the deaerator is heated to 160°F to 180°F 
by heat exchange with process pumparound or product streams.
As a young engineer in the 1960s, I had learned that cooling water 
should not be heated above 125°F to 135°F to avoid laydown of hardness 
deposits inside the tubes of water-cooled exchangers. What I had failed 
to grasp was that once water has been through a demin plant, there is no 
restriction on how high a temperature that water can be heated.
The effluent from the deaerator (230°F) will then typically flow to 
the boiler’s convective section, “ECONOMIZER,” zone. This usually 
consists of four to six rows of tubes at the top of the convective sec-
tion, where the BFW is heated to 350°F to 450°F. If the boiler is firing 
high-sulfur fuel oil (2 to 4 percent sulfur), this may be a problem. The 
dew point of H2SO4 in the flue gas may easily be as high as 450°F.
The 230°F water inlet may cause the flue gas temperature to drop 
below 450°F. This will precipitate a weak H2SO4 mist, which will 
aggressively corrode the fins or studs of the economizer tube bank. If 
low sulfur (less than 100 ppm H2S is being fired), H2SO4 corrosion 
should not be a problem.

	
S t e a m  G e n e r a t i o n 	
273
For boilers firing fuel oil (bunker), it’s best to preheat the BFW 
externally to perhaps 350°F to protect the boiler’s economizer con-
vective tubes from corrosion. If a small amount of vaporization occurs 
in the preheat exchanger, this should not compromise the operation 
of the economizer, provided that there is only a single inlet to the 
economizer section.
22.7  Boiler Thermal Efficiency
To estimate the efficiency of fuel to steam, three factors are involved.
	
1.	 Approximately, for each extra 360°F or 200°C in stack 
temperature, boiler efficiency drops by 10 percent.
	
2.	 Approximately, for each extra percent of stack O2, boiler 
efficiency drops by 1 percent.
	
3.	 For small package boilers (50,000 lb/hr), boiler external 
ambient heat loss is approximately 2 percent.
Thus, for a small boiler with a 600°F stack, 5 percent O2 in the flue 
gas, boiler efficiency is:
	
100% - 15% - 5% - 2% = 78%	
Of course, the overall boiler plant efficiency will be lower due to:
• Steam leaks
• Power to drive FD and ID fans
• Power to drive BFW pumps
• Steam tracing for freeze protection
• Energy consumed in demin and deaerator
• Power to drive raw water and condensate recovery pumps
• Plant lighting and instrumentation
Finally, did you know that for each Btu worth of electricity, 3 Btu 
worth of steam are required? 
22.8  Sloped Demister
On many boiler steam drums, there is a sloped demister to suppress 
entrainment and hence improve steam quality. However, if this dem-
ister becomes partly fouled with hardness deposits, it probably does 
more harm than good. In such cases, I would probably discard the 
demister rather than replace it. If you feel you have been doing a 
good job on level control in the boiler, but steam quality is still poor, 
you should consider this possibility.

	
274	
C h a p t e r  T w e n t y - T w o
Entrainment of high TDS boiler feedwater into steam from a boiler 
is promoted by excessive pH. Caustic is often added to the feedwater 
to reduce corrosion. However, if the pH increases much above 10.5, 
then the boiler tends to foam and hardness deposits are carried over 
into the steam. Hardness deposits degrade the performance of steam 
ejectors, steam superheating coils, and steam turbines.

CHAPTER 23
Vacuum Systems:  
Steam Jet Ejectors
T
he converging-diverging steam jet is a startlingly complex 
device. Not only is the theory of operation rather weird, but the 
jets are subject to a wide range of odd, poorly understood, and 
never reported malfunctions. For all these reasons, I dearly love to 
retrofit and troubleshoot steam jet systems.
Steam jets have been around for a long time. They have just as 
ancient an origin as do steam-driven reciprocating pumps. They were 
used on early steam engines to pull a vacuum on the now-archaic 
barometric condenser. More recently, they were used to develop vac-
uums in such services as
• Surface condensers that condense the exhaust steam from 
steam turbines
• Petroleum refinery crude-residue vacuum towers
• Flash evaporators used to produce concentrated orange juice
Steam jets are also employed to recompress low-pressure steam 
to a higher-pressure steam. Jets are sometimes used to compress 
low-pressure hydrocarbon vapors with higher-pressure hydrocar-
bon gas (instead of steam). They are really wonderful and versatile 
machines.
23.1  Theory of Operation
The converging-diverging steam jet is rather like a two-stage com-
pressor, but with no moving parts. A simplified drawing of such a 
steam jet is shown in Fig. 23.1. High-pressure motive steam enters 
through a steam nozzle. As the steam flows through this nozzle, its 
velocity greatly increases. But why? Where is the steam going in such 
a hurry? Well, it is going to a condenser. The condenser will condense 
the steam at a low temperature and low pressure. It will condense the 
277

C h a p t e r  T w e n t y - T h r e e
steam quickly. The steam accelerates toward the cold surface of 
the tubes in the condenser, where its large volume will disappear as 
the steam turns to water.
The motive steam accelerates to such a great velocity that it can 
greatly exceed the speed of sound (that is, exceed sonic velocity). This 
tremendous increase in velocity of the steam represents a tremendous 
increase in the kinetic energy of the steam. The source of this kinetic 
energy is the temperature and the pressure of the steam.
The conversion of pressure to velocity is a rather common, eve-
ryday phenomenon. Remember Hurricane Opal, which struck the 
Florida Panhandle in October 1995? It had peak winds of 145 miles 
per hour. The pressure in the eye of the hurricane was reported at 
27 inches Hg. A portion of the kinetic energy of the wind in a hur-
ricane is derived from the barometric pressure of the atmosphere. 
The lift that helps an airplane fly is also a result of the conversion of 
barometric pressure to velocity. Because of the shape of the wing, 
the air passes across the top of the wing at a higher speed than it

does below the wing. The energy to accelerate the air flowing across 
the top of the wing comes from the barometric pressure of the 
atmosphere. Hence, the air pressure above the wing is reduced 
below the air pressure underneath the wing.
Similarly, as the high-velocity steam enters the mixing chamber 
shown in Fig. 23.1, it produces an extremely low pressure. The gas 
flows from the jet suction nozzle and into the low-pressure mixing 
chamber. The gas flows into the mixing chamber because there is a 
very low pressure in the mixing chamber.
The rest of the jet is used to boost the gas from the mixing cham-
ber up to the higher pressure in the condenser. This is done in two 
compression steps: converging and diverging.
23.2  Converging and Diverging Compression
23.2.1  Converging Compression—Sonic Boost
When an airplane exceeds the speed of sound, we say that it breaks 
the sound barrier. In so doing, it generates a sonic wave or pressure 
wavefront. When steam and gas flow into the converging section of 
the jet diffuser shown in Fig. 23.1, the same thing happens. The grad-
ually converging sides of the diffuser increase the velocity of the 
steam and gas as the vapor enters the diffuser throat above the speed 
of sound. This creates a pressure wavefront, or sonic boost. This sonic 
boost will multiply the pressure of the flowing steam and gas by a 
factor of perhaps 3 or 4.
Note something really important at this point. If for any reason 
the velocity of the steam and gas falls below the speed of sound  
in the diffuser throat, the sonic pressure boost would entirely  
disappear.
23.2.2  Diverging Compression—Velocity Boost
As the steam and gas leave the diffuser throat, the flow then enters 
the gradually diverging sides of the diffuser. The velocity of the steam 
and gas is reduced. The kinetic energy of the flowing stream is par-
tially converted to pressure as the steam and gas slow down. This 
increase in pressure is called the velocity boost, which will multiply the 
pressure of the steam and gas by a factor of 2 or 3.
While smaller than the sonic boost, the velocity boost is more reli-
able. Even though the velocity in the diffuser throat in Fig. 23.1 falls 
well below the speed of sound, the increase in pressure in the diverg-
ing portion of the diffuser is only slightly reduced.
The overall pressure boost of a steam jet is obtained by multiply-
ing the sonic boost effect times the velocity boost effect. The overall 
boost is called the jet’s compression ratio.

23.3  Calculations, Performance Curves, and Other 
Measurements in Jet Systems
23.3.1  Vacuum Measurement
We have discussed the American system inches of mercury (inches Hg) 
in Chap. 10, “How Instruments Work.” Of more immediate inter-
est is Table 23.1. To do any sort of vacuum calculation, we need 
to convert to the absolute system, in millimeters of mercury  
(mm Hg). Unfor­tu­nately, we also need to correct measurements 
made with an American-type (inches Hg) vacuum gauge for 
atmospheric pressure. You can interpolate between the two sets 
of data in Table 23.1, to correct for almost the entire range of typ-
ical atmospheric pressures.
We will need to use this table to calculate a jet’s compression 
ratio when we measure vacuum pressures with an American-type 
(inches Hg) gauge.
23.3.2  Compression Ratio
When considering the performance of a vacuum jet, we must first 
consider the jet’s overall compression ratio. To calculate a jet’s com-
pression ratio:
	
1.	 Measure the jet’s suction pressure and convert to millimeters 
of mercury, as shown in Table 23.1.
	
2.	 Measure the jet’s discharge pressure and convert to millime-
ters of mercury.
	
3.	 Divide the discharge by the suction pressure. This is the com-
pression ratio.

281
It is not uncommon to find a proper jet developing an 8:1 ratio. 
More typically, jets will develop a 3:1 or 4:1 compression ratio. Any 
jet with less than a 2:1 compression ratio has some sort of really seri-
ous problem, but not necessarily with the jet itself.
23.3.3  Jet Discharge Pressure
The jet suction pressure is a function of the following factors:
• The overall jet compression ratio.
• The jet discharge pressure, as shown in Fig. 23.1.
The jet discharge pressure is controlled by the downstream con-
denser pressure. The minimum condenser pressure corresponds to 
the condensing pressure of steam at the condenser’s vapor outlet 
temperature. For example, let’s say that the condensing pressure of 
pure steam at 120°F is 80 mm Hg. If the condenser vapor outlet tem-
perature is 120°F, then the lowest pressure we could expect to meas-
ure at the condenser vapor outlet would be 80 mm Hg.
Let’s further assume that the pressure drop from the jet discharge 
through the condenser discharge is 10 mm Hg. The jet discharge pres-
sure would be 90 mm Hg. Let’s also say that the sonic boost is equal to 
3.60. The velocity boost is assumed to be equal to 2.5. The overall com-
pression ratio is then
3.60 × 2.5 = 9.0
The jet’s suction pressure is then
(90 mm Hg)/9.0 = 10 mm Hg
While I have seen steam jets develop compression ratios of 8:1 or 
9:1, the majority of jets do not work nearly as well as that.
23.3.4  Multistage Jet Systems
A single jet that discharges to the atmosphere or to a condenser oper-
ating at atmospheric pressure is called a “hogging” jet. Let’s assume 
that atmospheric pressure is 29.97 inches Hg or 760 mm Hg. Also, we 
will assume the jet is capable of an 8:1 compression ratio. The jet’s 
suction pressure would be
	
=
(760 mm Hg)
8.0
95 mm Hg 	
Referring to Table 23.1, this would mean that the jet inlet pressure 
was 26.2 inches Hg on an American-type vacuum pressure gauge. 
This is about the best we could expect with a single-stage jet.
Figure 23.2 shows a three-stage steam jet system. Let’s first calculate 
the overall compression ratio for the combined effect of all three jets.
Note that the atmospheric barometric pressure is 26 inches Hg (this 
is a chemical plant in Denver—the Mile High City). The first-stage jet 

	
282	
C h a p t e r  T w e n t y - T h r e e
gas inlet pressure is 25 mm Hg. The third-stage jet discharge pressure 
is 3 psig. A good rule of thumb is
• 1 psi = 51 mm Hg
	
The actual barometric pressure can be converted to absolute 
mm Hg, using the following rule:
• 1 inch Hg = 25.4 mm Hg
	
Therefore, the barometric pressure in Denver is
• 26 inches Hg × 25.4 = 660 mm Hg
	
The pressure at the third-stage jet discharge is then
• 660 mm Hg + (3 × 51) mm Hg = 812 mm Hg
	
The overall compression ratio is
• 813 ÷ 25 = 32.5
But what is the average compression ratio for each of the three jets? 
Well, let’s assume that the pressure drop for the first two condensers in 
Fig. 23.2 is zero. Then let’s remember that when compression stages

work in series, their compression ratios are multiplied together to cal-
culate the overall compression ratio. Then the average compression 
ratio per jet is
(32.5)1/3 = 3.2
We take the cube root of the average compression ratio, because 
the three jets represent three compression stages working in series.
In this calculation, I have made a potentially serious omission. 
That is, I have ignored the pressure drop through the interstage con-
densers #1 and #2. Typically, these condensers have a shell-side ΔP of 
only a few mm of Hg. Thus their effect may be ignored. However, if 
these condensers are fouled, or if they are suffering from condensate 
backup submerging the bottom edge of their internal air baffles, then 
their ΔP might be 50+ mm of Hg. Such a large pressure loss must be 
included in the above compression ratio calculations.
For example:
• The inlet pressure to a first-stage jet is 20 mm Hg.
• The inlet pressure to a second-stage jet is 100 mm Hg.
• The ΔP across the interstage condenser is 60 mm Hg.
• Then the compression ratio of the first-stage jet is 100 mm Hg, 
plus 60 mm Hg, divided by 20 mm Hg.
• This is (100 + 60) ÷ 20 = 8.0.
23.3.5  Jet Performance Curves
I have rather implied up to now that a steam jet, depending on its 
mechanical condition, will develop a fixed compression ratio. This 
is not true. For one thing, the gas rate through the jet will influence 
its suction pressure. This is shown on the typical jet performance curve in 
Fig. 23.3, which is drawn for a constant discharge pressure of 100 mm Hg.

C h a p t e r  T w e n t y - T h r e e
Let me make a critical comment about this curve. Variations in the jet’s 
discharge pressure may have a surprising (i.e., non-linear) effect on the 
jet’s suction pressure. Sometimes, a small reduction in the discharge 
pressure will make a tremendous improvement in the suction pres-
sure. The compression ratio might increase from 3:1 up to 7:1.
Sometimes, a very large reduction in the jet’s discharge pressure 
will not alter its suction pressure at all. The compression ratio might 
decrease from 7:1 to 3:1. It all depends on something called the critical-
flow characteristics of the jet. More on this subject in a moment.
23.3.6  Measuring Deep Vacuums
For any vacuums better than 120 mm Hg (or 25 inches Hg at sea level), 
an ordinary vacuum pressure gauge will not be accurate enough for 
technical purposes. An absolute mercury manometer, as shown in  
Fig. 23.4, is needed. All that is required to make this simple device is 
a length of glass tubing bent into a U-tube shape. One end is sealed 
and the other end is left open. Dry, clean mercury is then poured into 
the open end. The closed end of the U-tube is easily evacuated of air 
by tipping the glass U-tube on its side. A little jiggling will work out 
the last air bubble. The overall length of the tube will be about 8 inches. 
The mercury should wind up about 1 or 2 inches high in the open 
end of the U-tube.
To read the vacuum, the mercury level at the closed end must be 
pulled down by the vacuum even just a little below the top of the tube.

The difference in mercury levels between the closed and open ends of 
the U-tube is the precise mm Hg vacuum. Wet mercury will give com-
pletely wrong results.
23.3.7  Jet Malfunctions
Big Spring is located in the scrub desert of western Texas. Cold 
autumn mornings are followed by warm afternoons. The local refin-
ery’s cooling-water temperature follows this ambient-temperature 
trend. The vacuum tower in this refinery also seems to keep track of 
the time of the day.
At 6:00 a.m., the primary steam jet is running quietly and pulling 
a vacuum of 12 mm Hg. At 7:30 a.m., the jet begins to make infrequent 
surging sounds. It rather sounds as though the jet is slipping every  
15 or 20 seconds. As the morning coolness fades, the surging becomes 
more frequent. The vacuum also begins to slip from 12 to 14 mm Hg. 
Then, at about 9:00 a.m., as the surges have become so frequent as to 
be almost continuous, the vacuum plunges to 23 mm Hg. By 10:00 a.m., 
the surging has stopped and the vacuum at the jet suction has stabi-
lized at a poor 25 mm Hg. Many, if not most, operators of large vacuum 
jet systems have observed this problem—but what causes it?
23.3.8  Loss of Sonic Boost
Let’s refer to Fig. 23.2. As the cooling water warms, the temperature of 
condenser #1 increases. This also increases the condensing pressure. 
This raises the discharge pressure of the primary jet (jet 1), as well as 
the pressure in the diffuser throat (see Fig. 23.1). Higher pressure will 
result in a smaller vapor volume. And a smaller vapor volume will 
cause a reduction of the velocity in the diffuser throat.
The lower velocity in the throat does not affect the jet’s perfor-
mance, as long as the velocity remains above the speed of sound. If 
the velocity in the throat falls below the speed of sound, we say that 
the jet has been forced out of critical flow. The sonic pressure boost is 
lost. As soon as the sonic boost is lost, the pressure in the vacuum 
tower suddenly increases. This partly suppresses vapor flow from 
the vacuum tower. The reduced vapor flow slightly unloads con-
denser #1 and jet 2, shown in Fig. 23.2. This briefly draws down the 
discharge pressure from jet 1. The pressure in the diffuser throat 
declines. The diffuser throat velocity increases back to, or above, 
sonic velocity. Critical flow is restored, and so is the sonic boost. The 
compression ratio of the jet is restored, and the vacuum tower pres-
sure is pulled down. This sucks more vapor out of the vacuum tower 
and increases the loads on condenser #1 and jet 2 (the secondary jet). 
The cycle is then repeated. Each of these cycles corresponds to the 
surging sound of the jet and the loss of its sonic boost.
As the cooling-water temperature rises, the sonic boost is lost 
more easily and more rapidly. The surging cycles increase in frequency

C h a p t e r  T w e n t y - T h r e e
to 30 or 40 per minute. The vacuum tower pressure becomes higher 
and higher. Finally, the surges become so frequent that they blend 
together and disappear. The primary jet has now been totally forced 
out of critical flow. The sonic boost has been lost until the sun in Big 
Spring, Texas, sets and the desert cools. Surging then returns until the 
critical flow in the jet is restored, and the sonic boost is regained at 
about 9:00 p.m.
23.3.9  Restoring Critical Flow
Steam jets, especially the primary jets, are forced out of critical flow, 
most commonly because
• Inadequate capacity of the primary condenser (i.e., condenser 
#1 shown in Fig. 23.5).
• Overloading or poor performance of the second-stage jets.
The problem at Big Spring was rather typical. The two parallel, 
second-stage jets were not working as a team. Jet A in Fig. 23.5 was a 
real strong worker. Jet B was a loafer. It is rather like running two 
centrifugal pumps in parallel. Unless both pumps can develop about 
the same feet of head, the strong pump takes all the flow, and the 
weak pump is damaged by internal recirculation. In the case of jets 
working in parallel, the strong jet takes all the gas flow from the 
upstream condenser. Furthermore, the strong jet sucks motive steam 
out of the mixing chamber (see Fig. 23.1). As you can see in Fig. 23.5, 
the suction temperature of jet A is 20°F hotter than the condenser  
#1 outlet temperature. This could happen only if the flow of vapor in

the jet B suction line were backward. Blocking-in jet B stopped the pri-
mary jet from surging until the more intense heat of the late afternoon.
When I block-in one ejector that is running in parallel with one or 
two other jets, I always try to remember to close the large process 
inlet valve first. If you close the smaller motive steam valve first, then 
the discharge flow from the other parallel ejectors will recycle back 
through the jet you are removing from service. The vacuum will sud-
denly break. So block-in the steam valve second, and the discharge 
valve from the jet third. I’ve made the error of closing the steam valve 
prematurely, so you can be guided by my errors.
23.3.10  Calculating Sonic Velocity
I have discussed in this chapter the effect of reaching sonic velocity, 
also called the critical flow velocity or choke flow.
To calculate sonic velocity, VS in feet per second:
VS = 223 (K ⋅ T ÷ MW)1/2
where	
T = °F + 460 = °R
	
MW = Molecular weight, pounds
	
K = Ratio of specific heats (Cp ÷ Cv)
K for ethane is 1.2 K for air and hydrogen is 1.4. For higher molec-
ular weight components, assume K is 1.1. 
Sonic velocity is also referred to as choke flow. One characteristic 
of choke flow is that reducing the downstream pressure does not sig-
nificantly increase the flow through the choke point. Increasing the 
upstream pressure increases the flow in a linear proportion to the 
absolute increase in pressure.
A vapor-liquid mixture developing sonic velocity in a pipe will 
cause the liquid to atomize. The tiny droplets of liquid will then be 
difficult to settle out in a downstream separator vessel. This is often a 
cause for entrainment in vacuum tower feed nozzles.
23.3.11  Effect of Gas Rate
The most effective operating change to restore a jet to its critical-flow 
mode is to reduce gas flow. As I have described, this reduces the pri-
mary jet’s (jet 1’s) discharge pressure. Also, less of the energy of the 
motive steam is expended in accelerating the reduced gas flow. 
Hence, the steam enters the diffuser throat with greater kinetic energy. 
This also helps, along with the lower discharge pressure, in restoring 
critical flow and the jet’s sonic boost.
To reduce the gas flow from the vacuum tower, shown in Fig. 23.5, 
I cut the heater outlet temperature from 750 to 742°F. This reduced 
thermal cracking in the vacuum heater and the consequent pro-
duction of cracked gas. The pressure in the vacuum tower dropped 
from 21 to 12 mm Hg, and production of valuable heavy gas oil 

	
288	
C h a p t e r  T w e n t y - T h r e e
from the vacuum tower-bottom residue increased by 20 percent. I 
can still recall the warm afternoon sunshine on my face as I sig-
naled to the control-room operator to drop off that final degree of 
heater outlet temperature. I can still hear the last surge dying 
away as the primary jet recovered from its long illness. And as the 
jet began its steady, full-throated roar, I knew it was running in its 
proper critical-flow mode.
23.3.12  Reducing Primary-Jet Discharge Pressure
Let’s say that a jet is already in its critical-flow mode. It is already 
benefiting from both the sonic boost and the velocity boost. What, 
then, will be the effect of a reduction in the jet’s discharge pressure 
on the jet’s suction pressure? Answer—not very much. If a reduction 
in discharge pressure is made on a jet that is not working in its criti-
cal mode, there will always be some benefit.
But if the jet is already in critical flow, reducing the pressure down-
stream of the diffuser throat cannot significantly raise the flow of gas 
into the diffuser throat. I know, I’ve tried. Twice I have added a third-
stage jet to an existing two-stage jet system. The discharge pressure 
from the second-stage jet dropped by 500 mm Hg. The discharge pres-
sure of the first-stage jet dropped by 160 mm Hg. The suction pressure 
to the first-stage jet dropped by perhaps 2 mm Hg.
The critical discharge pressure for each jet is determined experi-
mentally by the manufacturer. It is usually noted on the jet specifica-
tion sheet. My experience indicates that exceeding this critical jet 
discharge pressure by the smallest amount will force the jet out of 
critical flow. Or, the way I see it, will cause the jet to suddenly surge 
a few times and then lose its sonic boost.
The inverse is not always true. A jet with less than its critical 
discharge pressure may not pick up its sonic boost. Operationally, 
this business of gaining or losing sonic boost is a rather dramatic 
effect.
23.3.13  Condensate Backup
The jet in Fig. 23.6 has a small calculated compression ratio of about 
(180 mm Hg)/(150 mm Hg) = 1.20. This extremely low compression 
ratio does not indicate any sort of jet malfunction. The high jet suction 
pressure is caused by the 140°F precondenser outlet temperature. The 
vapor pressure of water at 140°F is 150 mm Hg. There is a large 
amount of process steam flowing into the precondenser. The lowest 
possible pressure that the precondenser can operate at and still con-
dense the process steam is 150 mm Hg. As the jet sucks harder, it just 
pulls a few more pounds of water out of the precondenser, without 
altering the precondenser’s pressure.
The problem with the precondenser is condensate backup. 
Something, perhaps a partially plugged drain line, is restricting

condensate flow. As the condensate backs up, it reduces the surface 
area of the condenser exposed to the condensing process steam. 
This makes it more difficult for the process steam to condense. The 
condensate backup also subcools the condensate. The net result is 
that the precondenser vapor outlet temperature goes up and the 
precondenser liquid outlet temperature goes down.
Recently, on a job in Arkansas City, I was able to force a jet to surge 
and lose its sonic boost simply by raising the condensate level in its 
downstream condenser by just 6 inches. Lowering the level drew 
down the jet’s discharge pressure by a few millimeters of mercury 
and restored it to critical flow.
Condensate backup is also caused by a large number of problems 
associated with the barometric drain line, and especially with the seal 
drum, shown in Fig. 23.2:
• Air leak in drain line. This caused local chilling of the line 
near the leak. Likely, the intrusive air was mixing with the 
light liquid hydrocarbon in the line and promoting autore-
frigeration.
• Wax plugging in the drain line. Gas oil entrainment is often 
quite waxy. The cure is to steam-out the drain line.
• Sludge buildup in the seal drum. The bottom of the seal legs 
were only 4 inch above the bottom of the seal drum. The seal 
drum overflow baffle was 4 ft high. I had the drum cleared 
and cut at 18 inch off the seal legs.
• Biological corrosion inside the seal drum. The bacteria metabo-
lized H2S and iron in the warm seal drum aqueous phase to 
form the sludge. If the internal seal drum legs are made of car-
bon steel [should use 316 (L) stainless steel], the internal seal 
drum legs will hole-through and unseal the barometric legs.  

	
290	
C h a p t e r  T w e n t y - T h r e e
Running at very high liquid levels to submerge the hole is the 
temporary cure.
• False seal drum level indication. The level had been showing 
a dead-steady 80 percent level for months. Actual level when 
I blew-down the liquid level taps was 100+ percent.
• Too much naphtha in the vacuum tower feed made it impos-
sible for the vacuum condensate seal drum slop pumps to 
keep the level under control. Turning on the spare pump did 
not help, as both pumps were operating on the flat portion of 
their performance curves.
I have written a separate book pertaining to a wide variety of 
vacuum system problems: Troubleshooting Vacuum Systems (Wiley, 
2012). And my chapter on steam surface condensers also deals with 
pertinent vacuum system malfunctions.
23.3.14  Jet Freeze-Up
There is another type of jet surging, which is caused by the motive 
steam turning to ice. How is this possible? Certainly, steam cannot 
turn to ice inside the jet? But it can and does.
The jet system was in Mobile, Alabama. The symptoms of the 
problem were
• Extremely poor performance of the primary jet.
• The poor performance was constant, regardless of the cooling-
water temperature.
• The jet would roar along in a normal fashion, and then go 
extraordinarily quiet for 10 to 15 seconds.
• The outside of the mixing chamber would chill to exactly 
32°F during those times when the jet was quiet. This hap-
pened even though it was a bright, warm, sunny day in 
Mobile.
Incidentally, the way to measure surface temperatures in the field 
is with an infrared handheld thermometer. The response time of these 
thermometers is infinitely faster than in old-style, contact thermom-
eters. You can buy one from any good instrument catalog1 for a few 
hundred dollars.
Naturally, if the jet freezes, steam flow will stop. The jet will 
be quiet, and its compression ratio will be nil. But what causes the 
steam to turn to ice? Well, a number of factors extract heat from 
the steam:
• When any vapor expands, due to a pressure reduction (other 
than H2 and CO2), it cools off. This is called a Joule–Thomson 
expansion. The reduction in temperature of the steam is called 

	
Va c u u m  S y s t e m s :  S t e a m  J e t  E j e c t o r s  	
291
a reduction in sensible-heat content. The sensible heat of the 
steam is converted to latent heat of condensation. Does this 
mean that the latent heat of condensation of 10-psig steam is 
much higher than that of 450-psig steam? Let’s see:
 
• Latent heat of condensation of saturated 10-psig steam = 
980 Btu/lb.
 
• Latent heat of condensation of saturated 450-psig steam = 
780 Btu/lb.
• When the velocity of a vapor increases, some of the increase in 
kinetic energy is extracted from the sensible heat of the vapor.
• The steam also gives up some of its energy to provide 
increased momen­tum to the gas flowing into the jet suction 
nozzle (see Fig. 23.1).
If the motive steam were dry, these factors would reduce the 150-psig 
motive-steam saturated temperature from 350°F to about 100°F. But 
the motive steam in Mobile was not dry. It had partly condensed in 
the steam supply line to the jet. If steam is wet and contains liquid 
water, the water will flash to steam when the steam pressure is sud-
denly reduced to a vacuum. But the heat of vaporization comes from 
the sensible-heat content of the steam. If the steam contains 10 percent 
moisture, it will chill by 180°F on flashing. This implies that we could 
have the wet, motive-steam temperature dropping to -80°F as it 
enters the jet’s mixing chamber. But, of course, the steam will turn to 
ice when its temperature drops to 32°F. The ice blocks the flow of 
steam. As the steam velocity slows, the jet warms and melts the fro-
zen steam, and the steam flow is restored.
23.3.15  Wet Steam
The problem in Mobile was resolved by installing a small steam filter 
on the steam line to the jet. This filter extracts moisture from the 
steam and blows it out through a steam trap.
But wet steam is bad for a jet, even when it does not cause the jet 
to freeze. Mainly, wet steam causes erosion of the steam inlet nozzle. 
Erosion of this nozzle is the main reason why jets undergo mechani-
cal deterioration. As the nozzle erodes, it allows more steam to pass 
through into the diffuser. The diameter of the diffuser is designed to 
operate with a certain steam flow. If that design steam flow is 
exceeded, the diffuser operation suffers. Also, the downstream con-
denser pressure will also increase.
An eroded steam nozzle shows no obvious sign of damage. The 
erosion is quite uniform and the nozzle interior is smooth. The inner 
diameter of the jet must be checked carefully with a micrometer. 
Growth in diameter of just 5 to 10 percent is significant. The nozzle is 
intended to be replaced periodically, much like the impeller wear 
ring on a centrifugal pump.

23.3.15.1  Steam Ejector Temperature Profile
The motive steam, as it flows through the ejector, passes through 
three distinct portions of the ejector body:
• First—Steam nozzle
• Second—Converging section of the ejector
• Third—Diverging section of the ejector
The function of each of these three sections is:
• First—In the steam nozzle, the temperature (enthalpy) of the 
steam is converted to velocity (kinetic energy).
• Second—In the converging section, the velocity of the steam 
is used to compress the off-gas, air leaks, and the motive 
steam itself, due to the combined vapor flow exceeding criti-
cal velocity (the sonic boost).
• Third—In the diverging section, the velocity of the steam is 
used to compress the off-gas, air leaks, and the motive steam, 
due to the reduction in the velocity of the combined vapor 
flow (the velocity boost).
The temperature profile is observed by monitoring skin tempera-
tures with an infrared temperature gun. When I do this, here is what 
I’ve observed:
• First—If the motive steam is dry, saturated 150-psig, 360°F 
steam, then the temperature at the front portion of the ejector 
body will be around 100°F. The 360°F steam temperature has 
been converted into velocity in the steam nozzle.
• Second—If the inlet temperature at the converging section of 
the ejector is 100°F, then the temperature halfway along the 
ejector (at its throat or narrowest portion) will be about 200°F. 
The ejector has been heated by 100°F, due to the heat of com-
pression of the flowing vapor provided by the sonic boost.
• Third—If the inlet temperature at the diverging section of the 
ejector is 200°F, then the temperature at the discharge of the 
jet will be about 250°F to 300°F. The ejector has been heated 
another 50°F to 100°F, due to the heat of compression of the 
flowing vapor provided by the velocity boost.
Sometimes the first portion of the ejector will be a lot colder than 
100°F. That’s because there are several percent of moisture in the 
motive steam, which is bad.
Sometimes the converging portion of the ejector will heat up by 
10°F or 20°F, rather than by 100°F, as it should. That’s because there 
is no compression taking place in the converging portion of the 
ejector, which is also bad. Lack of a significant temperature rise 

	
Va c u u m  S y s t e m s :  S t e a m  J e t  E j e c t o r s  	
293
(about 100°F) across the ejector’s converging section is a positive 
indication that the ejector is failing to develop its sonic boost. This 
is the principal malfunction encountered in troubleshooting steam 
ejector performance.
The temperature profile I’ve just described will vary with:
• Vapor loads (air, cracked gas)
• Vapor composition (molecular weight)
• Ejector mechanical condition
• Steam conditions (moisture or superheat)
• Ejector discharge pressure, as controlled by the downstream 
condenser performance
• Suction pressure
I had observed a wide variety of temperature profiles of ejector 
bodies, and for many years I failed to understand the significance of 
my observations. After over 35 years of confusion, I decided to ana-
lyze the data using:
• My education in thermodynamics
• Mollier diagram for steam
I find it strange that the engineering principles that I was sup-
posed to have learned when I was 20, I only realized how to actually 
apply when I was well past 60. But, now that I think about it, pretty 
much all of life is like that.
Summary: A small (10°F to 20°F) temperature rise across the con-
verging section of a steam jet is a definite indication of the loss on the 
sonic boost and of a low ejector compression ratio. The overall tem-
perature rise across the ejector’s diffuser section should be 150°F to 
200°F. I have written an entire book on this complex subject, Trouble-
shooting Vacuum Systems (Wiley, 2012).
23.3.16  Don’t Know Why, But It Happens
I have learned a lot about how process equipment actually works by 
investigating comments such as “It may not make any sense to you, 
but that is what happens here.” Process equipment always con-
forms to the principles of science, but we have to get to know which 
principle to apply.
Figure 23.7 shows an old vacuum tower in Aruba. The chief opera-
tor on this unit made the following statements:
• “The colder the vapor outlet temperature from the precon-
denser, the better the vacuum that the ejector could develop, 
because of reduced vapor flow to the jet.” Agreed!

	
294	
C h a p t e r  T w e n t y - T h r e e
• “Increasing cooling-water flow to the precondenser decreases 
the vapor outlet temperature.” Agreed!
• “Closing the cooling-water outlet valve A, about three-fourths 
of the gate valve steam travel, increases cooling-water flow 
through the precondenser.” Nonsense!
Really, dear reader, how can closing a valve in a pipeline increase 
flow in that pipeline? It cannot, and it will not, and it did not. Yet, on the 
other hand, it is a really bad idea to disregard field observations made 
by experienced plant operators. So, let’s take a closer look at Fig. 23.7.
First, I tried opening valve A. Just as the chief operator said, the 
cooling-water outlet temperature increased, proving that water flow 
was reduced. Next, I checked the pressure at bleeder B; it was 12 inch 
of Hg. The pressure was so low at this point because of
• The 20-psi P of the cooling water as it flowed through the 
tube bundle.
• The 35 ft of elevation (about 15 psi of head pressure) that the 
water had to gain to climb to valve B. Of course, this 15 psi of

head loss was regained when the water flowed back down to 
the cooling-water return header.
The first idea I had was that the 120°F water would partially flash 
to steam at 12 inches Hg and the evolved vapor would restrict water 
flow. Wrong! The vapor pressure of water at 120°F is 26 inches Hg, 
not 12 inches Hg.
But cooling water is not just pure water. It is water that has been 
saturated with air in the cooling tower. Sure enough, when I calculated 
the amount of dissolved air that would flash out of water (which had 
been saturated with air at 90°F and atmospheric pressure), I found that 
a very large amount of air could flash out of solution. It was just as the 
chief operator had said. Opening valve A too much evolved large vol-
umes of air in the second pass of the U-tube precondensers, shown in 
Fig. 23.7. Certainly, the total volumetric flow through the outlet of the 
condenser does increase, as valve A is opened. But the incremental 
flow is all air, and all that air does is choke off the cooling-water flow.
23.4  Optimum Vacuum Tower-Top Temperature
The chief operator also insisted that lowering the vacuum tower-top 
temperature too much would hurt the vacuum. But why? There is no 
doubt that the colder the tower-top temperature, the less the heat-
duty load for the precondenser to absorb. Hence, cooling the vacuum 
tower-top temperature should, and did, reduce the precondenser 
vapor outlet temperature. This should have reduced the vapor load 
to the downstream jet. But it didn’t. Here is why:
• The vapor components distilled overhead from the vacuum 
tower consisted of steam, cracked gas, and naphtha.
• The steam and naphtha vapors would pretty much totally 
condense in the precondenser, shown in Fig. 23.7.
• Some of the cracked gas would dissolve in the condensed 
naphtha. Most of the cracked gas would flow onto the jet.
• Increasing the tower-top temperature would distill over more 
pounds of naphtha.
• The extra condensed naphtha would dissolve more cracked gas.
• The reduced flow of cracked gas to the jet would unload the 
jet and permit it to develop a larger compression ratio.
Of course, if the vacuum tower-top temperature became too high, 
the increase in the precondenser vapor outlet temperature would 
increase the vapor pressure of water. This factor would then limit the 
minimum pressure in the precondenser.
In another case, a large volume of NH3 was accidentally injected  
in the inlet to the condenser. The vacuum instantly improved. Why? 

	
296	
C h a p t e r  T w e n t y - T h r e e
Well, the NH3 reacted with the H2S in the cracked gas to form 
NH4HS (ammonium sulfide). This salt is very soluble in water; H2S 
is not. The H2S was effectively extracted from the cracked gas, and 
the downstream jet was thus unloaded and sucked harder.
Jets have been partially replaced by liquid ring-seal pumps. These 
are really positive-displacement compressors. The gas is squeezed 
between the vanes of the compressor’s rotor and a pool of liquid in the 
compressor’s case. Liquid ring-seal pumps are not interesting. They 
have no character. They are not as complex as steam jets. Anyway, I 
will discuss positive displacement compressors in later chapters.
23.5  Measurement of a Deep Vacuum without Mercury
Above 30 or 40 mm Hg of vacuum, an ordinary digital battery pow-
ered vacuum gauge is sufficient. However, only a vacuum mercury 
manometer is accurate in the 5 to 15 mm Hg range. As long as the 
mercury was dry, such a gauge gave excellent results. But few of my 
clients now permit the use of mercury in the field.
I have developed an alternate method that works almost as 
well as the vacuum mercury manometer. It’s really the same idea 
(see Fig. 23.8). Fill the closed end of the tubing with baby oil and 
mineral oil. Make sure you get the last bubble of air out of the 
closed end of the tubing. Always use fresh oil to prevent moisture

contamination of the oil. Fill the entire glass U tube with oil. Con-
nect the open end of the glass tubing to the vacuum pressure point 
being measured and open the connecting valve very slowly.
The specific gravity of baby oil is about 0.9 s.g. The specific grav-
ity of mercury is 13.6. Mercury is 15 times denser than baby oil. Refer-
ring to Fig. 23.8, divide the 150 mm of elevation difference in the 
manometer legs by 15 to determine that the vacuum is 10 mm Hg. For 
vacuums above 40 mm Hg, the oil-filled vacuum manometer is not 
practical, as it would be about 30 inches in overall length.
Do not use lighter fluids than baby oil, as they will create a vapor 
pressure at the closed end of the glass U tube. This will result in a 
measurement of a better vacuum than really exists. Water is also too 
volatile at moderate ambient conditions for this purpose. 
23.5.1  Troubleshooting Vacuum Systems
I have written an entire book on the subject of vacuum system mal-
functions: Norman P. Lieberman, Troubleshooting Vacuum Systems 
(Wiley, 2012), ISBN 978-1-118-29034-7, www.wiley.com. 
This book is based on my 48 years of field troubleshooting steam 
ejectors and surface condensers. The preceding chapter barely reflects 
the depth and complexity of this subject. However, if I had to select 
the most common problem with steam jets, I would choose steam 
hardness deposits that accumulate inside the steam nozzles. These 
deposits are a consequence of entrainment of water droplets in the 
steam from the boiler due to poor boiler feed water level control.

CHAPTER 24
Steam Turbines
Use of Horsepower Valves 
and Correct Speed Control
A 
steam turbine is a machine with an ancient genealogy. It is a 
direct descendant of the overshot water wheel, used to kick 
off the Industrial Revolution in England, and the windmill 
still used in Portugal. Turbines are widely used in process plants to 
drive everything from 2-horsepower pumps to 20,000-hp centrifugal 
compressors. They are versatile machines, in that they are intrinsi-
cally variable-speed devices. Electric motors are intrinsically fixed-
speed machines. It is true that there are a variety of ways to convert 
AC (alternating-current) motors to variable speed, but they are all 
expensive and complex.
There are two general types of steam turbines: extraction and con-
densing. The most common turbine with which the process operator 
comes into contact is used to spare an electric-motor-driven centrifugal 
pump. The three-phase, AC motors used in the United States and 
South America are either 1800 or 3600 rpm. The motors used in Europe 
are 1500 or 3000 rpm. Small steam turbines (20 to 500 hp) used to drive 
centrifugal pumps are rated for the same speed as the electric motors 
that are used in that particular service.
24.1  Principle of Operation and Calculations
Did you ever turn a bicycle over on its handlebars and squirt water 
from a garden hose at its front wheel? What causes the wheel to spin 
with such great speed? What is the property of water striking the 
spokes that causes the wheel to spin? Is it the pressure of the water 
hitting the spokes that spins the wheel? Certainly not! While the 
water pressure in the hose might be 40 psig, as the water discharges 
from the hose nozzle, its pressure surely falls to the atmospheric pres-
sure in our garden. But what happens to the pressure of the water? It 
is converted to velocity!

C h a p t e r  T w e n t y - F o u r
It is the velocity of the water, then, that causes the wheel to spin. 
The velocity of the water is transferred to the spokes of the wheel.
What force of nature causes a windmill to spin? Answer—the 
wind (or the velocity of the air). What causes a steam turbine to spin? 
Answer—the velocity of the steam hitting the turbine wheel.
24.1.1  A Simple Steam Turbine
Figure 24.1 is a conceptual drawing of a simple topping steam turbine. 
An actual turbine does not look anything like this sketch. The 400-psig 
motive steam enters through a governor speed-control valve. This valve, 
sometimes called the Woodward governor, controls the flow of steam 
into the steam chest. If the turbine is running below its set speed, the 
governor valve opens.
It is really just like cruise control on your car. You select the speed 
you want to drive at. If the car is going slower than the speed you 
selected, its set speed, the gas pedal is depressed to bring the car up 
to your selected set speed. The governor speed-control valve is just 
like the gas pedal.

The pressure drop across the governor control valve in Fig. 24.1 is 
100 psi. This sort of pressure drop is called an isoenthalpic expansion—a 
term used in thermodynamics meaning that the heat content of the 
steam has been preserved during its reduction in pressure from 400 to 
300 psig. It is also an irreversible expansion, meaning that the ability of the 
steam to do work has been reduced. As the steam passes through the 
governor, a substantial amount of its pressure is lost, because of friction 
in the governor valve.
The 300-psig steam next passes through the steam nozzle. This is 
an ordinary nozzle. It screws into a hole in the wall that separates the 
steam chest from the turbine case. The nozzle is shaped to efficiently 
convert the pressure of the 300-psig steam to velocity. The pressure of 
the steam, as soon as it escapes from the steam nozzle, is already the 
same as the exhaust steam pressure (100 psig).
All the pressure energy lost by the steam in expanding from 
300 to 100 psig is converted to velocity. This is called an isoentropic 
or reversible expansion. The term isoentropic is a thermodynamic 
expression meaning that the entropy of the steam has not increased. 
The term reversible in this context means that I could take the 
high-velocity, 100-psig steam exhausting from the nozzle, run it 
backward through an identical nozzle, and convert the steam’s 
kinetic energy back into 300-psig steam. An isoentropic expansion 
is also frictionless, in that the ability of the steam to do work is 
preserved.
If you are using your Mollier diagram, you will have noted that 
the temperature of the steam has dropped from 375°F to 220°F. The 
220°F is the temperature of 17-psia saturated steam. That 155°F drop 
in the steam temperature represents 85 Btu/lb. The 85 British Ther-
mal Units (Btu) has been converted into kinetic energy. Most of the 
kinetic energy of the steam, as it passes through the steam nozzle, is 
derived from the temperature of the expanding steam.
The high-velocity steam strikes the buckets around the rim of 
the turbine wheel shown in Fig. 24.1. Actually, these so-called buck-
ets resemble blades or vanes. I imagine the term “bucket” is a carry-
over from the days of the water wheel. The velocity of the steam is 
now transferred to the spinning turbine wheel. If the turbine is run-
ning below its set speed, the speed controller causes the governor 
speed-control valve to open to allow more steam to flow into the 
steam chest.
24.1.2  Calculating Work Available from Motive Steam
Dear engineering reader, please recover from your desk drawer your 
steam tables. In the back, there will be a Mollier diagram for steam. 
Figure 24.2 is a representation of your Mollier diagram. We will use 
this diagram to calculate the amount of work we can recover from 
steam with a turbine:

	
302	
C h a p t e r  T w e n t y - F o u r
	
1.	 The motive steam conditions are 375°F and 160 psia, which 
determine point A. Note that the motive-steam pressure is the 
pressure in the steam chest, not the supply steam pressure. 
	
2.	 When steam passes through a turbine, it undergoes an iso-
entropic expansion. The work that the steam does in transfer-
ring its momentum to the turbine wheel exactly equals the shaft 
horsepower developed by the turbine. The entropy of the sys-
tem is therefore constant. On this basis, extend a line through 
point A straight down the Mollier diagram. This line repre-
sents a constant entropy expansion.
	
3.	 The exhaust-steam pressure is 17 psia. The intersection of the 
isoentropic expansion line and 17-psia constant-pressure line 
together determine point B in Fig. 24.2.
	
4.	 Now measure the enthalpy difference in British Thermal 
Units per pound of steam between points A and B on the 
vertical (y axis) scale.
	
5.	 As we shall see in the following section, most of the increase 
in velocity or kinetic energy of the steam does not come from 
the pressure of the steam, but from its enthalpy. By enthalpy, 
I mean both the temperature and latent heat content of the 
steam. Thus, as steam expands through a steam nozzle to a

region of lower pressure in the turbine case, the steam cools 
and is partly condensed.
	
6.	 Divide your answer by 2500 Btu/hp. This is the fraction of a 
horsepower that each pound of steam can produce. However, 
as turbines are not 100 percent efficient, multiply the calcu-
lated horsepower by 0.90 to account for internal turbine inef-
ficiencies called windage losses. Incidentally, the reciprocal of 
the calculated horsepower per pound of steam is called the 
water rate, which is the pounds of motive steam needed to 
generate 1 horsepower worth of shaft work.
	
7.	 Multiply the horsepower per pound of steam calculated in 
step 6 by the turbine steam flow in pounds per hour. This is 
the total shaft work that appears at the turbine’s coupling. 
This is the amount of horsepower that is available to spin a 
centrifugal pump or a variable speed air blower. 
24.1.3  Exhaust Steam Conditions
You may have noticed that point B in Fig. 24.2 is below the saturated-
steam envelope line. Does this mean that the exhaust steam would 
have appreciable amounts of entrained water? Does this mean that 
the motive steam may sometimes partially condense inside a turbine? 
Answer—yes! Does this also mean that turbine exhaust steam may 
have too high a moisture content to be used in certain downstream 
services? Well, it is fine for reboilers, but it would be unsuitable for 
steam jets (see Chap. 23).
Looking at Fig. 24.2, see if you can agree with these statements:
• The higher the motive-steam superheat temperature, the 
drier the exhaust steam.
• The higher the exhaust-steam pressure, the drier the exhaust 
steam.
Lowering the exhaust-steam pressure always allows us to extract 
more work from each pound of steam. That is why we often exhaust 
steam to a condenser. But other than minimizing the exhaust-steam 
pressure, how else may we increase the amount of work that can be 
extracted from each pound of steam?
24.1.4  Horsepower Valves
It is the velocity of the steam impacting on the turbine wheel buck-
ets that causes the turbine to spin. If that is so, then the way to 
extract more work from each pound of steam is to increase the 
velocity of the steam as it escapes from the steam nozzle, shown in 
Fig. 24.1.

	
304	
C h a p t e r  T w e n t y - F o u r
The escape, or exit, velocity of this steam is a function of the steam 
pressure in the steam chest. If we raise the pressure in the steam chest 
by 30 percent, then the velocity of the steam leaving the nozzle would 
go up by 30 percent as well. It is true that I could simply open up the 
governor and reduce the pressure drop of the steam across the gover-
nor from 100 to 10 psi. This would raise the pressure in the steam chest 
from 300 to 390 psig. But I would also get 30 percent more pounds of 
steam flow through the nozzle. The turbine would spin a lot faster and 
develop a lot more horsepower. This is not my objective.
What I wish to achieve is to maintain the same horsepower out-
put from the turbine. At the same time, I want to force open the gov-
ernor speed-control valve, raise the pressure in the steam chest, but 
decrease the steam flow through the steam nozzle. The only way this 
can be done is to make the nozzle smaller.
We could shut down the turbine and unbolt the steam chest to 
expose the nozzle block, which is the wall that separates the steam 
chest from the turbine case. We could unscrew the existing nozzle 
and replace it with a smaller nozzle. A nozzle of 20 percent less diam-
eter would reduce the nozzle cross-sectional area by 36 percent:
(1.00 - 0.20)2 = 0.64 = 64%
100% - 64% = 36%
This procedure is called reducing the port size of the nozzle. It 
works fine, except that we have permanently derated the capacity of 
the turbine by 36 percent, and next month we might need this capacity.
24.1.5  Speed Valves
Figure 24.3 shows a steam turbine with three, rather than one, nozzles. 
The single, largest, left-hand nozzle is called the main nozzle. It han-
dles 60 percent of the motive-steam flow. Each of the two smaller 
nozzles handles 20 percent of the steam. These 20 percent nozzles can 
be plugged off by a device sometimes called a horsepower valve, jet 
valve, speed valve, star (for the handle shape) valve, or port valve.
If we close off one of the two horsepower valves, steam flow into 
the turbine will drop—initially by 20 percent. The turbine will slow. 
This will cause the governor valve to open. The pressure drop across 
the governor will decrease. The pressure in the steam chest will rise. 
The flow of steam through the 60 percent port nozzle and the remain-
ing 20 percent port nozzle will increase. The velocity of the steam strik-
ing the buckets will also increase. The turbine wheel will now come 
back up to its set point.
The net effect of this exercise will be to save not 20 percent of 
the motive steam, but 10 percent. The 20 percent reduction in noz-
zle area is partially offset by the opening of the governor valve. The 
inefficient, irreversible, isoenthalpic expansion and pressure drop 
across the governor speed control valve is reduced. The efficient, 

	
S t e a m  Tu r b i n e s 	
305
reversible, isoentropic expansion and pressure drop across the noz-
zles is increased.
If we now attempt to shut the second horsepower valve, we may 
be able to save a second 10 percent increment of steam. But if the 
governor goes wide open, we will have to open this horsepower 
valve again. You see, once the governor is 100 percent open, we will 
have lost our ability to control the turbine’s speed. This is no good, 
because we want the turbine to run at a constant speed.
Do not pinch on the horsepower valves. They must be left com-
pletely opened or firmly closed. Leaving them in a partially open posi-
tion will badly damage the valve seats by erosion, reduce the efficiency 
of the turbine, and make it impossible to close the valves in the future.
24.2  Selecting Optimum Turbine Speed
An ordinary American-type turbine is designed to run at 3600 rpm. 
Its overspeed trip will cut off the motive steam flow at about 3750 rpm. 
But the turbine can be run at any lower speed. There is usually a small 
knob on the left side of the governor-valve assembly that is used to

change the set speed. The question is, how do we know the best speed 
to operate the turbine?
Figure 24.4 shows a centrifugal pump driven by a steam turbine. 
The correct operating speed for the pump and turbine is the speed 
that puts the process-control valve in a mostly open, but still control-
lable position. As we slow the turbine to force open the process-
control valve, the turbine’s governor valve will close. Steam flow to 
the turbine will decline in accordance with fan laws:
Shaft work ∼ (speed of driver)3
This means that if we drop the speed of the turbine by about 3 per-
cent, motive-steam flow will decline by about 9 percent. However, 
there is an additional benefit.
Slowing a turbine closes the governor valve. This may now per-
mit us to close an additional horsepower valve without losing our 
flexibility to control the speed of the turbine. Closing that final horse-
power valve will save us another 10 percent of steam.
Our overall objective is to wind up with both the process-control 
valve downstream of the pump and the governor speed-control valve 
in a mostly wide open, but still controllable position. To achieve this 
dual objective, we have to simultaneously:
• Optimize the turbine speed
• Optimize the number of horsepower valves that are closed
It is rather like solving two equations with two unknowns.

24.2.1  An Old, But Better, Idea
The control scheme shown in Fig. 24.4 is certainly quite common. But is it 
the best? Figure 24.5 is a copy of the crude charge system in a now-defunct 
refinery in Port Arthur, Texas. I saw it in operation many years ago. It 
worked fine. The required flow of crude directly controls the governor. 
The turbine speed is then always at its optimum. The P across the 
process-control valve is always zero, because there is no process-control 
valve. This design is a direct descendant of the original method of control-
ling the steam flow to pumps. The steam inlet valve was opened by the 
operator, so that the desired discharge flow was produced.
Why, then, do we need process-control valves on the discharge of 
variable-speed-driven pumps? Why, indeed!
24.2.2  Steam Rack
On larger steam turbines, we have automatically, rather than manu-
ally, operated horsepower valves. The mechanism that controls the 
movement of the horsepower valves is called a steam rack. If you have 
a large steam turbine driving a compressor, you have likely seen such 
a steam rack.
A horizontal rod extending across the width of the turbine has a half-
dozen cams fixed along its length. These cams lift and lower, in sequence, 
plungers attached to the horsepower valves. Watch these plungers in 
action. If you slow the compressor, here is what will happen:
	
1.	 The governor valve will start to close.
	
2.	 The steam chest pressure will fall.

3.	 The steam rack will move, so as to close only one of its mul-
tiple horsepower valves.
	
4.	 The steam chest pressure will rise, and the governor will 
open back up.
If you look on the local control panel of such a turbine, you will 
probably see four steam pressures displayed:
• Steam header pressure
• First-stage steam chest pressure
• Second-stage steam pressure
• Exhaust-steam pressure
These larger turbines often let down the steam in two or more 
stages. They are called multistage turbines. Their principle of opera-
tion is not significantly different from a simple single-stage machine.
24.2.3  Condensing Turbines
Most of the turbines you will encounter in your work are called “top-
ping,” or extraction, turbines. The idea of such a turbine is to extract 
much of the potential work from the motive steam, and then use the 
exhaust steam to reboil towers. Typically, the energy content of the 
exhaust steam is only 10 to 20 percent less than that of the motive steam. 
That is the calculation we just did with the Mollier diagram. The rest of 
the energy of the steam may then be used as the steam condenses to 
reboil towers. This sounds pretty efficient. It is the basis for the new 
cogeneration projects you may have heard about. Of course, this system 
was used by the British Navy in the nineteenth century.
The condensing turbine does not produce exhaust steam. All the 
turbine exhaust steam is turned into water in a surface condenser. We 
will study surface condensers in Chap. 25. The surface condenser is 
just like the sort of vacuum condensers we discussed in Chap. 23. The 
exhaust steam condenses under a deep vacuum—typically 76 mm 
Hg, or 0.1 atm. Basically, then, a condensing steam turbine loses all 
the potential benefit of using its exhaust steam to reboil towers. But 
for what purpose?
Let’s say a turbine was using 400-psig (i.e., 415-psia) steam 
exhausting to a 30-psig (i.e., 45-psia) steam header. The work gener-
ated was 2000 hp. If we had condensed the steam at 76 mm Hg (i.e., 
1.5 psia), the work generated would be 4000 hp. In the first case, the 
P of the steam was 370 psi (415 − 45 = 370). In the second case, the P 
of the steam is 413.5 psi (415 − 1.5 = 413.5).
If the P increases by only 12 percent, why does the amount of 
work that is extracted from each pound of steam double? The answer 
is that it is not the pressure of the steam that drives the turbine. It is 
the velocity of the steam impacting on the turbine wheel buckets.

	
S t e a m  Tu r b i n e s 	
309
The velocity of the steam escaping from the steam nozzle (see 
Fig. 24.1) is 25 ft/s, when the exhaust pressure is 30 psig (45 psia). 
What, then, would be the velocity of the steam if the exhaust pressure 
were 76 mm Hg (1.5 psia)?

No wonder the work we can extract from a condensing steam 
turbine is so much greater than with an extraction, or topping, tur-
bine. The most efficient condensing turbines may convert 30 percent 
of the steam’s energy into work. These turbines use 1500-psig steam, 
and exhaust to a surface condenser at 50 mm Hg. The most efficient 
machine ever built is the high-bypass, radial-flow jet turbine engine, 
commonly used in commercial aircraft, which has a 40 percent 
efficiency.
I rather like to adjust steam turbines. It reminds me of Professor 
Peterson, my thermodynamics instructor. It makes me think that the 
four years I spent at Cooper Union was time well spent. It is just nice to 
see how the Second Law of Thermodynamics functions in the real world.

CHAPTER 25
Surface Condensers
The Condensing Steam Turbine
M
ore of the world’s energy is consumed in surface condensers 
than for any other single use. Even at the very start of the 
Industrial Revolution, the father of the surface condenser, 
the barometric condenser, consumed huge amounts of heat.
The central idea of our industrialized society is to have machines 
do the work formerly done by humans or animals. The technical 
problem that kicked off the Industrial Revolution was flooding in the 
tin mines of Cornwall, a region in southern Britain. To work the mines 
and extract the valuable tin ore, steam-driven reciprocating pumps 
had been constructed. These plunger-type pumps were moved up 
and down by the famous beam engines, and these reciprocating 
engines were powered by steam, thanks to the efforts of Thomas 
Newcomen in 1712.
The motive steam for these reciprocating engines was charged into 
a steam cylinder. The piston inside the cylinder was pushed up by the 
expanding steam. The piston then lifted the beam attached to the recip­
rocating pump. Cold water was admitted next and jetted into the steam 
cylinder. The cold water absorbed the latent-heat content of the steam. 
The steam pressure inside the cylinder dropped, and the piston 
dropped. This pulled the beam down. It was the up-and-down move-
ment of the beam that powered the reciprocating pump. The struc-
tures, beams, foundations, and bits and pieces of ancient machinery are 
scattered all across Cornwall. (Caution: The tin mine entrances are 
rather obscure, overgrown with brambles, and your author more or 
less fell into one. If you choose to explore the mining areas of Cornwall, 
be very careful as many of these shafts are hundreds of feet deep. There 
are numerous stories about people and livestock slipping into these 
disused shafts and being drowned in the accumulated water or simply 
falling to their deaths down the mine shafts.)
There was a big problem with the initial beam engine design. 
When the cold water was admitted into the steam cylinder, the water 
not only absorbed the latent heat of the condensing steam but also 
cooled the iron walls of the steam cylinder. Then when the next 
311

	
312	
C h a p t e r  T w e n t y - F i v e
charge of steam was admitted to the cylinder from the boiler, a lot of 
the steam’s heat was wasted in reheating the iron walls of the cylinder. 
Then again, an awful lot of cold water was wasted in cooling the 
metal of the steam cylinder each time the motive steam had to be 
condensed.
All this wasted a tremendous amount of coal. Actually, only 1 to 
2 percent of the energy of the coal was converted into useful work. 
Quite suddenly, the steam engine was revolutionized. Its efficiency 
was increased by a factor of 10. This was all due to the innovations 
of James Watt, who invented the external barometric condenser in 
the late 1760s.
25.1  The Second Law of Thermodynamics
Steam power was fully developed before the introduction of the sci-
ence of thermodynamics. The steam engine was designed and built 
by ordinary working people, such as Mr. Newcomen and Mr. Watt. 
Mr. Watt’s invention is illustrated in Fig. 25.1.
Rather than cooling and condensing the steam in the cylinder, the 
steam was exhausted to an external condenser. In this external con-
denser, the exhaust steam was efficiently contacted with the cold 
water. This external or barometric condenser rather looks and per-
forms like the deaerator we discussed in Chap. 21. The external con-
denser obviously achieved Mr. Watt’s original objective. He could 
condense the steam without cooling the cylinder. But the barometric 
external condenser was found to have an even more important attri-
bute. Let me explain.
The boilers in those days were not pressure vessels. They were con-
structed from sheets of wrought iron and assembled by riveting and 
hammering the seams. At best, they could hold a few atmospheres of 
steam pressure. The low-pressure steam generated did not really push 
the beam and piston up. The beam was pulled up by a heavy weight 
attached to the far end of the beam. This also pulled the piston up.
Well, if the steam did not really push the piston up, what did the 
steam do? Answer—the condensing steam pulled the piston back 
down. As the steam condensed, it created an area of very low pres-
sure below the piston (see Fig. 25.1). This low pressure sucked the 
piston down. The colder the temperature at which the steam con-
densed, the lower the pressure at which the steam condensed.
The lower the pressure in the steam cylinder, the more forcefully 
the piston was drawn down. And the more forcefully the piston was 
sucked down, the more work the beam engine could do with the 
same amount of coal consumed.
It is easy to see how the barometric condenser could condense the 
exhaust steam more efficiently than periodically squirting water into 
the steam cylinder. The barometric condensers could absorb the latent 
heat of condensation of the steam at temperatures of 120°F or less. 

	
S u r f a c e  C o n d e n s e r s 	
313
Water condenses at a pressure of 25 inches Hg at this temperature. This 
extremely low vacuum sucked the piston down more forcefully 
because of the greater differential pressure across the cylinder. In other 
words, on top of the cylinder, there was atmospheric pressure; below 
the cylinder, there was the pressure in the barometric condenser.
Two problems arose with the use of the barometric condenser. 
First, if the condenser operated at sub-atmospheric pressure, how can 
the water be drained out of the condenser? That is easy. Set the con-
denser on a hill 34 ft high. Then drain the water down through a 
barometric leg to a seal pot. The pressure that a column of water  
34 ft high exerts is equal to 1 atmosphere, or 1 bar. Hence the term 
barometric “leg.”

C h a p t e r  T w e n t y - F i v e
The second problem was air leaks. Air drawn into the system 
would build up in the condenser. This non-condensable vapor was 
drawn off by using a steam jet.
Certainly, if we could generate steam at a higher pressure and 
temperature in the boiler, we could push the piston in Fig. 25.1 up 
with greater force. Thus thought Richard Trevithick of Cornwall, who 
pioneered the use of high-pressure steam in the 1790s. And as the 
mechanical design of boilers has improved over the last 200 years, 
this has been done, and we certainly can now push up the beam with 
greater force. As a result, the amount of work that may be extracted 
from steam has more than doubled. But it was James Watt, working 
alone, repairing a model of a Newcomen engine,1 who made the big 
leap forward in improving the efficiency of the steam engine.
And what, dear reader, does all this have to do with the Second 
Law of Thermodynamics? This law states
	
W = (H) (T2 - T1)	
(25.1)
where   W = amount of work that can be extracted from the motive 
steam
	
H = enthalpy of the motive steam minus the enthalpy of the  
condensed water
	
T2 = temperature at which the steam is generated in the boiler
	
T1 = temperature at which the steam is condensed in the 
barometric condenser
According, then, to the Second Law of Thermodynamics, Mr. Watt  
lowered T1. But, of course, the professors who worked out these laws 
were just formalizing the discoveries that practical working people 
had made 100 years before their time, using common sense and 
craftsmanship.
25.1.1  The Surface Condenser
There is another problem with the barometric condenser that did 
not become apparent at first. When the British Navy decided to con-
vert from sail to steam, this problem was immediately obvious. 
While steam can be generated from seawater, it is far better to use 
freshwater, especially if one wishes to generate high-temperature, 
high-pressure steam. And as freshwater supplies are limited at sea, 
it would be great if the condensed steam could be recycled to the 
boilers. But the cooling-water supply to the barometric condensers 
was naturally seawater, which mixed with the steam condensate.
The solution is straightforward. Do not condense the steam by 
direct contact with cold water, as is done in the barometric condenser. 
Condense the steam by indirect contact with the cold surface of the 
tubes in a shell-and-tube condenser. Hence the name surface condenser, 
a sketch of which is shown in Fig. 25.2. Compare Fig. 25.1 with the 

	
S u r f a c e  C o n d e n s e r s

surface condenser. Is there really much difference? Other than recov-
ering clean steam condensate for reuse, there is no difference at all. I 
last used a barometric condenser in 1976, on a sulfuric acid plant reac-
tor feed gas boost blower, and it worked just fine.
25.1.2  Using the Second Law of Thermodynamics
The motive-steam supply to a condensing steam turbine such as that 
shown in Fig. 25.3 is 360°F and 150-psig saturated steam. The turbine 
is exhausting to a surface condenser. The cooling water to the con-
denser is 92°F. The turbine is driving a centrifugal compressor. The 
calculated horsepower produced by the turbine is 10,000 bhp (brake 
horsepower). Bill Duvall, your supervisor, has told you that colder 
62°F well water is to be substituted for the 92°F cooling-tower water. 
Bill has given you the following additional information:
• The steam jets are oversized for the non-condensable flow, 
which consists of only a very few pounds of air in-leakage.
• The motive-steam flow to the turbine is not known, but won’t 
change.
• The pressure in the surface condenser is unknown and can-
not be measured.

• The cooling-water flow rate is not known, but will not change 
either. The water will just be colder.
• The efficiency of the turbine and compressor is not known, 
but is presumed to remain constant.
Bill has asked you to calculate the new compression horsepower 
output from the compressor. Using Eq. (25.1), we note
• Compression work W is proportional to horsepower.
• H will go up from its prior value a little because the enthalpy 
of the condensed steam will be lower (because it’s colder).
• As the cooling-water supply is 30°F lower, we will assume 
that the condensation temperature T1 in Eq. (25.1) is reduced 
by 30°F.
• The enthalpy difference between 150-psig saturated steam at 
360°F and steam condensed under a good vacuum is roughly 
1000 Btu/lb.
• The enthalpy reduction of condensing the steam at a 30°F 
lower temperature will increase H by 30 Btu/lb.
• H in Eq. (25.1) thus increases by 3 percent.
• T2, the temperature of the motive steam, is always 360°F. With 
92°F cooling water, we will assume that T1 is 120°F.

• (T2 - T1), with 92°F cooling water, is (360°F - 120°F) = 240°F.
• T1, with 62°F cooling water, is 30°F cooler than T1, with 92°F 
cooling water; that is, the new T1 is (120°F - 30°F) = 90°F.
• (T2 - T1), with 62°F cooling water, is then (360°F - 90°F) = 270°F.

Combining the H effect of 3 percent with the larger (T2 - T1) 
effect of 12.5 percent in Eq. (25.1) results in a compression horsepower 
increase of 16 percent or about 11,600 bhp total. If you wish, work 
through the same problem but use 5-psig saturated steam, which was 
used to power steam engines in the eighteenth century, rather than 
the 150-psig saturated steam we used in our current example. The 
answer will illustrate why Mr. Watt is still well remembered espe-
cially in Cornwall along with justly revered Mr. Trevithick.
Imagine you are sitting in a meeting when the vice president asks, 
“Should we use an aerial cooler or colder seawater to condense the 
power plant turbine exhaust steam?” Harry, the chief engineer, offers 
to run through the relative efficiency of the turbine for the two cases 
using his computer model and report back after lunch. You, the junior 
staff engineer, look up into space and after a few moments state, 
“Based on the Second Law of Thermodynamics I’ve calculated an 
enhanced efficiency of 16.1 percent for the cooler seawater case.” 
I always add that extra decimal for dramatic effect.
25.2  Surface Condenser Problems
In Chap. 23 we reviewed several problems pertaining to steam jet pre-
condenser and intercondenser problems. The surface condensers, 
which serve condensing steam turbines, are subject to all the same 
problems and a lot more. A standard surface condenser package with 
an associated two-stage jet system is shown in Fig. 25.3. By way of 
summarizing many of the problems that occur with this sort of equip-
ment, I will relate my trials and tribulations with K-805, an auxiliary 
combustion air blower at the Good Hope Refinery in Norco, Louisiana 
(now Valero).
The problem with this new air blower was that we could not 
bring the turbine speed above its natural harmonic critical speed. The 
critical speed of a turbine is stamped on the manufacturer’s name-
plate. Turbines are typically run well above their critical speed. If, for 
some reason, a turbine is run close to its critical speed, it will experi-
ence uncontrolled vibrations and self-destruct.

C h a p t e r  T w e n t y - F i v e
For a surface condenser to work properly, non-condensable 
vapors must be sucked out of the shell side. This is done with a two-
stage jet system, as shown in Fig. 25.3. When I first commissioned the 
jets, they were unable to pull a good vacuum. Moreover, water peri-
odically blew out of the atmospheric vent. I found, after considerable 
investigation, that the condensate drain line from the final condenser 
was plugged.
I directed the maintenance crew to disassemble and clean the 
drain lines from both the final condenser (B) and the primary jet 
discharge condenser (A). Unfortunately, they failed to reassemble 
the loop seal from condenser A. But what is the purpose of this loop 
seal?
The pressure in condenser A is greater than that in the surface 
condenser and less than that in the final condenser (condenser B). This 
means that condenser A is operating at vacuum conditions. This pre-
vents the condensed steam formed in condenser A from draining out 
to atmospheric pressure, unless the condenser is elevated by 10 to 15 ft. 
To avoid this problem, the condensate is drained back to the lower-
pressure surface condenser. To prevent blowing the non-condensable 
vapors back to the surface condenser as well, a loop seal is required. 
The height of this loop seal must be greater than the difference in pres-
sure (expressed in ft of water) between the surface condenser and the 
primary jet discharge condenser (condenser A).
With the loop seal gone, the non-condensable vapors simply circu-
late around and around through the primary jet, but no substantial 
vacuum in the surface condenser can be developed.
Having replaced the loop seal piping (some units use a steam trap 
instead of this loop seal), I started steam flow to the turbine. But the 
vacuum in the surface condenser, which had started out at an excel-
lent 27 inches Hg, slipped down to 14 inches Hg. This loss in vacuum 
increased the back-pressure in the turbine case. The higher pressure 
in the turbine case reduced the velocity of the steam striking the 
buckets on the turbine wheel, which reduced the amount of work 
that could be extracted from each pound of steam.
Note that the vacuum measurements of 27 inches Hg and 14 inches 
Hg are expressed in the vacuum measurement system typically used in 
American refineries where:
• 30 inches Hg = zero mm Hg (i.e., full vacuum)
• 0 inches Hg = atmospheric pressure (i.e., no vacuum)
Thus 27 inch of Hg vacuum is really 3 inches of Hg absolute. And 
14 inches of Hg vacuum is really 16 inches of Hg absolute. I know this 
is confusing, but that’s the way vacuum pressure measurements and 
gauges are in process plants in the United States.
For practice, pull out your Mollier diagram. If the motive steam is 
400 psig and 650°F, what is the effect of reducing the vacuum in the 

	
S u r f a c e  C o n d e n s e r s 	
319
surface condenser from 27 to 14 inches Hg? Answer: 13 percent loss 
in horsepower (see Chap. 24).
The turbine began to slow. It slowed to its critical speed and 
began to vibrate. Before shutting down the turbine to avoid damage 
due to the vibrations, I noted the following:
• The temperature of the turbine vapor exhaust to the primary 
jet had increased from 125 to 175°F.
• The temperature of the condensate draining from the surface 
condenser had decreased from 125 to 100°F.
• The condensate pump was cavitating, as indicated by an 
erratically low discharge pressure.
The increase in the vapor outlet temperature from a condenser, as 
compared to a decrease in the temperature of the condensate from the 
same condenser, is a sure sign of condensate backup. The condensate 
is covering some of the tubes in the surface condenser. This subcools 
the condensate and does no harm.
However, the number of tubes exposed to the condensing steam is 
also reduced. This forces the steam to condense at a higher temperature 
(as discussed in Chaps. 12 and 18). In effect, the condensate backup has 
reduced the surface area of the condenser available to condense the 
steam. The higher the condensation temperature of the steam, the 
higher the condensation pressure of the steam. Just like the deaerator I 
described in Chap. 21.
Take a look at Fig. 25.3. It is the vapor outlet temperature of the sur-
face condenser, rather than the condensate outlet temperature of the sur-
face condenser, that determines the real condensing temperature and 
pressure of the exhaust steam.
Condensate pumps serving surface condensers have a common 
problem. Their suction is under a vacuum. For example, let’s assume 
the following for Fig. 25.3:
• The surface condenser pressure = 27 inches Hg.
• The condensate water level in the boot is 11 ft above the suc-
tion of the pump.
• One inch of mercury (1 inch Hg) is equal to a head of water of 
1.1 ft (this is a good rule of thumb worth remembering).
The pressure at the suction of the condensate pump is then

Often, centrifugal pumps develop seal leaks. If the suction of a

through the leaking seal. The pump’s capacity will be severely 
reduced. To stop the suspected air leak, I sprayed water from a hose 
over the pump’s seal. Now, instead of sucking air, the leaking seal 
drew in cold water. As a result
	
1.	 The cavitation of the condensate pump stopped.
	
2.	 The high water level in the boot was pulled down.
	
3.	 The condensate outlet temperature increased.
	
4.	 The vapor (or non-condensable) outlet temperature decreased.
	
5.	 The vacuum in the surface condenser was restored.
	
6.	 And the turbine speed came back up, well above its critical 
speed.
But not for long. After 15 minutes of operation, the turbine speed 
slipped back down. Once again, I had lost a lot of vacuum in the sur-
face condenser. Once again, the vapor outlet temperature had dramati-
cally increased. But this time the condensate outlet temperature had 
also increased. What was my new problem?
I now observed that the surface condenser cooling-water outlet 
temperature had increased from 100 to 135°F. This is a sign of loss of 
cooling-water flow. As none of the other water coolers in the plant 
had been affected, I concluded that the cooling-water inlet to my sur-
face condenser was partly plugged.
I had the front endplate on the cooling-water side of the surface 
condenser (called the channel head cover) removed. Most of the tube 
inlets in the channel head tubesheet were plugged with crayfish (but in 
Louisiana, where this story is set, everyone calls these little creatures 
crawfish).
The offending wildlife were removed. The condenser was reas-
sembled. The motive steam was started to the turbine. Both the turbine 
and the air blower were running well above critical speed. We lined the 
flow of combustion air up to the combustion chamber. Everything was 
finally going my way, except for one minor problem.
The governor speed-control valve, shown in Fig. 25.3, was  
100 percent open. The plant’s boiler house was not sending us the proper 
pressure steam. I was supposed to be getting 460-psig steam, but was 
only receiving 400-psig steam. This reduced the steam flow through the 
nozzles in the turbine’s steam chest by 15 percent. The operators at the 
power station assured me that the problem was temporary. The normal 
460-psig steam pressure would be restored by morning.
Ladies and gentlemen, it is not a good idea to run a turbine with 
the governor speed-control valve wide open. Why? Because you no 
longer have any speed control. And the turbine speed is then free to 
wander. The rest of this story is pure philosophy.
During the evening, my operators decided to increase the com-
bustion air flow from the blower or air compressor. This is done by 

	
S u r f a c e  C o n d e n s e r s 	
321
opening the suction valve to the blower. Naturally, it requires more 
work to compress more air. But the turbine could not produce any 
more work or horsepower because the steam turbine’s governor 
speed-control valve was already 100 percent open!
So the turbine slowed down. And what was the only possible 
speed that it could slow down to? Why, the critical speed, of course. 
The turbine and blower began to vibrate. The bearings were dam-
aged. The turbine’s rotor became unbalanced. A rotating element on 
the air blower touched a stationary component in the blower’s case. 
The stationary component broke off and wrecked the blower. That 
was the end of K-805.
By what law of nature was the turbine forced to slow exactly to its 
critical speed? You see, dear reader, life is perverse. And if anything 
bad can happen, it is going to happen to me.
25.2.1  Non-condensable Load
The gas that accumulates inside the surface condenser is called the 
non-condensable load to the steam jets. Some of the non-condensable 
load consists of CO2 accidentally produced when the boiler feedwa-
ter is vaporized into steam. Air leaks through piping flanges and 
valves are other sources of non-condensable vapors. But the largest 
source of non-condensable vapors is often air drawn into the turbine 
case through the shaft’s mechanical seals. To minimize this source of 
leaks, 2 or 3 psig of steam pressure is ordinarily maintained around 
the seals. However, as the turbine’s shaft seals deteriorate, air in-leak-
age problems can overwhelm the jet capacity. This will cause a loss of 
vacuum in the surface condenser.
If vacuum in the surface condenser is bad, there are two possible 
causes. Either the jets are at fault or the surface condenser is at fault.
Air leaking into the surface condenser results in vapor binding. This 
causes an increase in the shell-side heat transfer thermal resistance. In 
effect, the steam does not make good contact with the exterior of the 
surface condenser tubes. This vapor-binding effect often appears to the 
operators as if the tubes are fouled with cooling-water deposits.
Thus, even without any loss in vacuum due to an air leak, the 
performance of a surface condenser is degraded as a consequence of 
an increasing concentration of air or non-condensables inside the sur-
face condenser.2
Whereas shell-side fouling in a surface condenser is uncommon, 
loss of heat transfer coefficient due to air binding is as common as 
tube-side fouling due to poor-quality cooling water.
25.2.1.1  Jet Problems
These include too high or too low motive-steam pressure, excess 
wear on the steam nozzles, high condenser back-pressure, and air 
leaks that exceed the jet’s capacity. To determine whether a poor vac-
uum in a surface condenser is due to such jet problems, consult the 

	
322	
C h a p t e r  T w e n t y - F i v e
chart shown in Fig. 25.4. Measure the surface condenser vapor outlet 
temperature and pressure. Plot the point on the chart. If this point is 
somewhat below the curve, your surface condenser’s loss of vacuum 
is due, at least in part, to jet deficiencies.2
25.2.1.2  Surface Condenser Problems
These include undersized surface condenser area, water-side foul-
ing, lack of water flow, condensate backup, leaking seal strips around 
the air baffle, and excessive cooling-water inlet temperature. To 
determine whether a poor vacuum in a surface condenser is due to 
such heat-transfer problems, plot the surface condenser vapor outlet 
temperature versus pressure on the chart shown in Fig. 25.4. If this 
point is on or slightly below the curve, it is poor heat transfer in the 
surface condenser itself that is hurting the vacuum.
The curve in Fig. 25.4 also represents the best possible vacuum 
that can be obtained in any surface condenser. The majority of surface 
condensers I have seen do operate right on the curve. Condensers 
operating below the curve are typically suffering from air in-leakage 
through the turbine shaft seals.
25.2.1.3  Refinery Vacuum Precondenser Fouling
A precondenser in a refinery vacuum tower service is like any surface 
condenser, with the following characteristics:
• Triangular tube pitch
• ¾-inch tubes
• 15/16-inch tube spacing
• Fixed tubesheet
The fixed tubesheet configuration means that the bundle cannot 
be extracted from the shell. The small tube pitch configuration makes

it utterly impossible to chemically clean the shell side in place for any 
shell ID much above 30 inch.
Recently, we had a refinery precondenser that had a 25 mm Hg 
ΔP. We tried the following chemical cleaning procedure:
• Step 1—Steam through with an aggressive vapor-phase sol-
vent used to clean tower internals.
• Step 2—Circulate methanol for several hours and flush with 
water.
• Step 3—Circulate toluene for several hours and flush with water.
• Step 4—Circulate HCl for several hours and flush with water.
• Step 5—Steam through.
Afterward, ΔP had dropped from 25 to 20 mm Hg (calculated clean 
ΔP was 5 mm Hg). Cost of the cleaning was $130,000. My client was 
not pleased with this result.
The correct design, then, for this service is:
• Pull-through bundle that can be extracted from the shell for 
cleaning
• One-inch O.D. tubes
• Rotated square pitch
• 1½-inches tube spacing
A ¾-inch tube on 1¼-inch spacing, I would imagine, is also 
cleanable.
A fixed tubesheet exchanger in a refinery precondenser service 
for a vacuum tower is a throwaway item. One of my clients just 
engaged in this exercise. Replacement for the 60-inches ID shell, as 
per my specs above, was $1,300,000 (in 2013). Not a happy situation.
25.2.2  Function of the Final Condenser
We discussed before that the drain from the final condenser shown in 
Fig. 25.3 had plugged. Rather than unplugging the drain, could we 
have simply disconnected the final condenser (condenser B) and 
vented the discharge from the secondary jet (jet 2) to the atmosphere? 
Would this have helped or hurt the vacuum in the surface condenser?
The final condenser hurts the upstream vacuum. The final con-
denser increases the discharge pressure from the secondary jet and 
thus makes the jet system work slightly harder to expel the non-
condensable gas load.
What, then, is the true function of the final condenser? Well, if the 
tiny amount of condensed steam is not needed, the final condenser 
serves no function at all. It may safely be discarded. Why, then, do 
surface condensers come with final condensers? It is just a conven-
tion that, for most plants, makes no particular sense. It is really just a

holdover from the design to conserve freshwater on the old British 
naval steamships.
25.2.3  Leaking Ejector Condenser Partition Plate
On the vapor outlet of steam turbine surface condensers, there is a 
two-stage ejector system and a two-stage condenser. Referring to 
Fig. 25.5, this two-stage condenser is actually a small condenser 
divided into two portions on the shell side by a partition baffle.
What will be the consequences of a leak developing in this parti-
tion baffle? I just encountered this problem last week for the first 
time, although I now understand that it is not uncommon.
For clarity, let’s assume for Fig. 25.5 that valve A is closed and 
valves B and C are open. Note that the inlet pressure to the second-
stage jet (380 mm Hg) is double its design pressure. Hence the poor 
vacuum (100 mm Hg) in the upstream surface condenser. If a leak 
develops in the partition plate in the ejector condensers, then non-
condensables (i.e., air) will leak back from the 780 mm Hg discharge

of the second-stage jet into the 380 mm Hg suction of the second-
stage jet. This internal non-condensable leakage will cause internal 
recirculation and overloading of the second-stage jet. Hence the poor 
performance (i.e., only a 780 ÷ 380 = 2.05 compression ratio) of the 
second-stage jet.
The symptoms of this problem were:
• Closing valve C improved the surface condenser vacuum by 
30 mm Hg.
• Closing valve C did not cause water to blow out of the atmo-
spheric vent.
• With valve C open, the atmospheric vent was under a slight 
negative pressure.
• With valve C shut, the atmospheric vent began to blow out 
non-condensables (air) in an erratic manner.
The solution to this problem was not to repair the defective 
ejector condenser. This had been done before, but without prevent-
ing a repeat failure. As I’ve explained in Section 25.2.2 of this text, 
the final or second-stage condenser serves no function. It’s a design 
error. So in this case, as shown in Fig. 25.5, valves B and C were 
shut and the local atmospheric vent valve A was opened. This 
allowed the second-stage jet to discharge directly to the atmo-
sphere. As a result, the pressure in the surface condenser dropped 
by about one-half.
In reality, valve A did not exist. The second-stage jet was vented 
to the atmosphere by disconnecting the piping at the outlet flange of 
the ejector.
25.3  Surface Condenser Heat-Transfer Coefficients
Heat-transfer coefficients in this book have the units of Btu/[(h)(ft2)
(°F)], where the ft2 term refers to the surface area of the surface con-
denser. The °F term refers to the condensing steam temperature minus 
the average tube-side cooling-water temperature.
Most unfortunately, an incorrect correlation for heat-transfer 
coefficients for surface condensers has become widely disseminated 
in several books devoted to heat transfer. This correlation predicts 
heat-transfer coefficients for clean condensers of about 650, when 
the water-side velocity is about 6 ft/s. Use of this correlation has led 
to some extremely serious problems, with which your author is inti-
mately acquainted.
The correct heat-transfer coefficient for a clean surface condenser, 
with a water-side velocity of 6 ft/s, is about 200 to 240. Including an 
allowance for fouling, we suggest you use 140 to 160 overall heat-
transfer coefficient for steam surface condensers. While I have 

	
326	
C h a p t e r  T w e n t y - F i v e
observed clean coefficients approaching 400, I would not count on 
maintaining 400 after several years of service on an industrial sur-
face condenser.
25.3.1  Effect of Air on Condensate Film Heat Transfer
I've been helping a young engineer working at a plant in Norco, 
Louisiana, with a steam surface condenser problem. Actually, this young 
engineer is very smart. Smart enough not to follow my advice. For over 
a year I’ve been telling him that the cause of his poor surface condenser 
performance was a low heat-transfer coefficient due to fouling on the 
condenser shell side. This turned out to be 100 percent correct.
The poor heat transfer in the shell side of the surface condenser 
was increasing condenser vapor outlet temperatures, and hence the 
vapor pressure of water in the condenser outlet. Also correct.
The high water vapor pressure was thus limiting vacuum. Correct.
Therefore, I concluded that the shell side of the condenser must be 
fouled with hardness deposits from the poor-quality motive steam to 
the turbine. Thus, the shell side needs to be chemically cleaned. One 
hundred percent wrong!
Recently, the condenser heat-transfer coefficient was doubled just 
by improving the performance of the first-stage ejector. This was 
done by improving condensate drainage from the lead interstage 
condenser on the discharge of the first-stage ejector. As the amount of 
non-condensables (i.e., air) plus steam flow from the surface con-
denser was increased, the interface resistance between the cooling 
water tubes and the condensing steam was greatly reduced. This 
doubled the observed overall heat-transfer coefficient in the surface 
condenser. A vast increase (5 inches Hg or 126 mm Hg) in condenser 
performance was achieved.
This has nothing to do with the effect on the partial pressure of 
water due to air leaks. It is really “fouling” of the exterior of the tubes 
with air. I know this is complex, but it is all explained and quantified in 
the literature. This problem is best described by the term vapor binding.
To restore drainage from the lead interstage condenser, the engi-
neer flushed out the drain line, which was full of black gunk. The 
literature reference is Henderson and Marchello (1969), “Film Con-
densation in the Presence of Non-Condensibles,” Journal of Heat 
Transfer, Vol. 91, August, pp. 447–450. Also, I have a message for 
Misters Henderson and Marchello: “God sees the truth, but waits.” 
As for the young engineer, the hero of the story, he’s still waiting for 
his reward from the owners of that plant in Norco.

and petroleum refineries takes place in shell-and-tube heat 
exchangers. The surface condenser we discussed in Chap. 25 is an 
example of a shell-and-tube heat exchanger.

of the heat exchangers I have worked with are ordinary shell-and-tube 
exchangers, the design of which has not changed since the 1920s.
Before considering the process aspects of heat transfer, let’s look at 
the mechanical components of the heat exchanger shown in Fig. 26.1. 
This shell-and-tube heat exchanger is actually a compromise between 
four aspects of heat-exchanger design:
• Allowance for thermal expansion
• Efficient heat transfer
• Ease of cleaning
• Mechanical robustness
26.1  Allowing for Thermal Expansion
Referring to Fig. 26.1, we can see how a floating-head exchanger works. 
The tube-side flow enters the bottom of the channel head. This assumes 
the cold fluid to be on the tube side. The cold fluid may be on the shell 
side or the tube side of an exchanger. The convention is to put the 
327

C h a p t e r  T w e n t y - S i x
cold fluid nozzle on the bottom of the exchanger. Sometimes this is 
necessary. Sometimes it does not matter, but it is still the convention.
Inside the exchanger’s channel head, we have the pass partition 
baffle, which divides the channel head into two equal portions. This 
baffle forces the total flow only through the bottom half of the tubes. 
The tubes themselves are pipes of either 0.75 or 1 inch OD (outside 
diameter). The front end of each tube is slipped into a slightly larger 
hole drilled into the channel head tubesheet. This tubesheet is a disk about 
2 inch thick, slightly larger than the inner diameter of the shell (shell ID).
The tubes are firmly attached to the tubesheet by “rolling.” After 
a tube is pushed into the tubesheet, a tapered tool is inserted into the 
open end of the tube and forcefully rotated. The tube’s diameter is 
thus slightly expanded. While rolling is quite effective in sealing the 
tube inside the tubesheet, rolls have been known to leak.
The tube-side fluid now flows into the floating head, which acts as 
a return header for the tubes. The tube-side flow makes a 180° turn 
and flows back through the top half of the floating-head tubesheet. The 
floating head is firmly attached to the floating-head tubesheet. But 
why is it that one end of the tubes must be left free to float? The rea-
son is thermal expansion—or, more precisely, the differential rate of 
thermal expansion between the tubes and the shell.

Not all shell and tube exchangers have a floating head. Many 
exchangers have individual U bends for each tube. In such cases, 
each of the U bends functions like a mini–floating head for each tube.
The requirement to leave one end of the tubes free to float creates 
a rather unpleasant process problem. The most efficient way to trans-
fer heat between two fluids is to have true countercurrent flow. For a 
shell-and-tube exchanger, this means that the shell-side fluid and the 
tube-side fluid must flow through the exchanger in opposite direc-
tions. When calculating the log mean temperature driving force (LMTD), 
an engineer assumes true countercurrent flow between the hot fluid 
and the cold fluid.
But this is not the case with a floating-head exchanger. The tube-
side fluid reverses direction in the floating head. It has to. There is no 
way to attach the tube-side outlet nozzle to the floating head. It is a 
mechanical impossibility. So we bring the tube-side fluid back to the 
top half of the channel head. Half of the tubes are in countercurrent 
flow with the shell-side flow. And that is good. But the other half of the 
tubes are in concurrent flow with the shell-side flow. And that is bad.
When calculating the LMTD for such a floating-head exchanger, 
the engineer has to apply the F-factor derating coefficient to reflect 
the loss in heat-transfer efficiency because of the floating head. A typi-
cal exchanger might lose 5 to 30 percent of its capacity because of non-
true countercurrent flow. (See D. Kern, “Heat Transfer Fundamentals,” 
for calculation of F-factors.)
26.1.1  Designing to Allow for Thermal Expansion
26.1.1.1  One-Pass Tube-Side Exchangers
I have not been completely accurate in the preceding discussion. 
Many exchangers are designed to bring the tube-side fluid in one end 
of the shell and out the other side. This is a true countercurrent 
arrangement. To provide for thermal expansion in such exchangers, 
an expansion joint is provided. These expansion joints are prone to 
leaking. They represent inferior mechanical engineering practice.
For moderate-temperature and low-pressure condensers, such as 
vacuum surface condensers (see Chap. 25), a single pass on the tube 
side is not uncommon. These exchangers are typically fixed-tubesheet 
designs. Such exchangers are fine from a purely process point of view. 
However, there is no practical way to disassemble the exchanger to 
clean the outside (i.e., the shell side) of the tubes. This inability to clean 
the shell side frequently leads to tremendous loss of efficiency after 
the condensers foul.
26.1.1.2  Shell-Side Flow
The hot shell-side flow enters the exchanger, as shown in Fig. 26.1, 
through the top inlet nozzle. Not shown on this sketch is the impinge-
ment plate, which is simply a square piece of metal somewhat larger 

	
330	
C h a p t e r  T w e n t y - S i x
than the inlet nozzle. Its function is to protect the tubes from the ero-
sive velocity of the shell-side feed. The plate lies across the upper row 
of tubes.
The four tube support baffles shown in this exchanger (see Fig. 26.1) 
serve a dual function:
• They serve to support the tubes.
• More importantly, they promote high cross-flow velocity.
The concept of cross-flow velocity is quite important in under-
standing how heat exchangers work. This concept is related to a flow 
phenomenon called vortex shedding. Perhaps you have seen a wire 
quivering in the wind. What causes the wire to vibrate with such 
energy? What causes water to swirl around a tree stump in a river?
When a fluid such as air or water flows perpendicularly across a 
wire or tube, vortices, such as those shown in Fig. 26.2, are created. 
The resulting turbulence that forms behind a wire will cause the wire 
to vibrate. The turbulence that forms behind a tube in a heat exchanger 
promotes good heat transfer.
Turbulence always encourages good sensible-heat transfer. The 
greater the velocity, the more violent the turbulence. For example, I 
recall a -40°F day in Fort McMurray, Alberta. The air is quite still, and 
I am comfortable. Suddenly the wind comes up. The rate of sensible-
heat transfer from my body to the ambient air increases tenfold. Why 
does this happen?
Our bodies are always surrounded by a thin layer or film of stag-
nant air. This film is like a layer of insulation. It retards heat transfer 
between our skin and any surrounding fluid. Movement of the fluid

causes turbulence. The turbulence disturbs the film and reduces the 
film’s resistance to heat transfer.
To encourage vortex shedding and turbulence on the shell side of 
a heat exchanger, we must increase the cross-flow velocity. To calcu-
late the cross-flow velocity, we proceed as follows:
	
1.	 Find the distance between the adjacent tube support baffles, 
in inches.
	
2.	 Count the number of tubes at the edge of the tube support 
baffle. As shown in Fig. 26.3, this would be 7.
	
3.	 Multiply the number of tubes by the space between each 
tube, in inches.
	
4.	 Multiply the inches measured in step 1 by the inches calcu-
lated in step 3.
	
5.	 Divide by 144 to obtain the shell-side cross-flow area in 
square feet.
	
6.	 Divide the pounds per second of shell-side flow by the fluid 
density in pounds per cubic foot. This will give you the volu-
metric flow in ft3/s.
	
7.	 Divide the volume calculated in step 6 by the area calculated 
in step 5. This is the cross-flow velocity.

A good cross-flow velocity for water is 3 to 5 ft/s. For fluids other 
than water, a reasonable cross-flow velocity, in feet per second, is
30
(Density)1/2
where the density term is the density of the shell-side fluid, in pounds 
per cubic foot (lb/ft3).
The baffle cut, shown in Fig. 26.3, is usually about 20 to 30 percent 
of the diameter of the baffle. The smaller the baffle cut, the more per-
pendicular the flow across the tubes. Perpendicular flow encourages 
desirable cross-flow velocity and vortex shedding. But a smaller baf-
fle cut will also increase the pressure drop on the shell side.
26.1.1.3  Effect of Shell-Side Pressure Drop
Reducing the baffle spacing increases cross-flow velocity and 
improves heat transfer. But it also increases the shell-side pressure 
drop. Reducing the baffle cut also improves heat transfer, but 
increases P.
Too much shell-side pressure drop can create a problem. The 
problem is flow through the bypass area shown in Fig. 26.3. This 
bypass area is caused by three factors:
• The tube support baffles must have a diameter somewhat 
smaller than the ID of the shell.
• The holes drilled in the baffles for the tubes cannot be drilled 
too close to the edge of the baffles.
• The use of an impingement plate requires the removal of sev-
eral rows of tubes. This creates a large gap between the edge 
of the tube bundle and the shell. It is the primary purpose of 
the seal strips to reduce this gap (discussed in the next sec-
tion). For the seal strips to fulfill this function, one of the seal 
strips in each pair must extend the full length of the tube 
bundle. This is rather complicated to explain. However, if 
you will look at a tube bundle that has been extracted from its 
shell, you will understand why this is needed, and how 
impingement plates render seal strips essential for good sen-
sible heat transfer from a shell-side fluid.
The gap thus created between the shell ID and the outer row of 
tubes will permit the shell-side fluid to bypass around the tubes. This 
is obviously very bad for heat transfer. And as the shell-side P 
increases, the percent of fluid that is squeezed through the bypass 
area increases.
If the baffle spacing gets too small, the shell-side heat-transfer 
rate will actually worsen. This happens even though the cross-flow 
velocity increases. What can be done to correct this problem?

26.1.1.4  Shell-Side Seal Strips
See if you cannot find an old tube bundle lying around your plant. 
Many such bundles have pairs of metal strips set around the edge of the 
tube bundle. These metal strips are typically 0.25 inch thick and 4 inch 
wide. They extend down the length of the tubes. As seen in Fig. 26.4, 
they are inserted in grooves cut in the tube support baffles. These seal 
strips often increase heat-transfer efficiency by 5 to 10 percent.
The function of seal strips is to interfere with, and hence reduce, 
the fluid flow through the bypass area. Often, one pair of seal strips is 
used for every 18 inch of shell ID (inner diameter). These seal strips 
encourage good shell-side cross-flow velocity and also help reduce 
localized fouling caused by low velocity.
Please note that the tube support baffles are normally installed 
with the baffle cut in a vertical position. I have shown the baffle cut in 
Fig. 26.1 in a horizontal position for clarity. Baffles are installed verti-
cally in most exchangers to reduce buildup of sludges in the bottom 
of the shell and avoid trapping vapors in the top of the shell.
For exchangers with vertically cut baffles, the shell-side impinge-
ment plate will be opposite the shell-side inlet nozzle. Contrary to 
the location of the seal strips shown in Fig. 26.4, the critical seal 
strips will be set on either side of the impingement plate (see Fig. 28.1 
in Chap. 28). Additional pairs of seal strips can also be installed as 
shown in Fig. 26.4. (See Chap. 28, “Shell-and-Tube Heat Exchangers:

seal strips.)
26.1.1.5  Terminal-Tube Velocity
Have you ever seen a heat-exchanger tube bundle pulled? Perhaps 
many of the tubes were bent and twisted like partly cooked spaghetti. 
This distortion could not be very good for the shell-side heat transfer. 
The cause of the bent tubes is called terminal-tube velocity. Let me explain.
Let’s assume we have a new heat exchanger. The fluid on the tube 
side is crude oil. Crude oil, like many process fluids, will eventually 
foul and plug heat-exchanger tubes. The tendency to lay down foul-
ing deposits is accelerated by
• Low velocity
• High temperature
• Dirt, salts, corrosion products, and other particulates
The crude oil is being heated by a hot-oil stream circulating 
through the exchanger’s shell. Even though the exchanger is new, the 
flow of crude through all the tubes is not equal. Some of the tubes 
naturally run somewhat slower, and in some of the tubes, heating the 
crude oil will run faster.
Those tubes that start running slower tend to get hotter. As the crude 
oil in these tubes gets hotter, the growth of fouling deposits accelerates. 
As the buildup of deposits in the slower tubes increases, the flow through 
these tubes is further restricted. The lower velocity increases fouling 
rates and restricts flow. This also increases the temperature of the slower 
tubes and accelerates the rate of fouling. These tubes continue to plug 
and foul, and run slower, until crude-oil flow is essentially lost.
Meanwhile, the flow of crude oil through those tubes that started 
out running faster increases. The crude-oil flow is backed out of the 
slower tubes by the fouling deposits. The extra flow increases the 
velocity in the tubes that initially ran faster. The higher velocities 
retard the buildup of fouling deposits. Also, the greater flow keeps 
these tubes cooler. This also discourages the accumulation of deposits 
inside the tubes.
To summarize, some of the tubes in the bundle continue to foul until 
they plug off. These tubes get hotter until they reach the temperature of 
the hot oil circulating through the shell. Other tubes continue to receive 
more and more flow. The velocity in these tubes increases to the point 
where the rate of fouling becomes inconsequential. This velocity is called 
the terminal-tube velocity. These tubes may run 50 to 150°F cooler than the 
plugged tubes.
26.1.2  Differential Rates of Thermal Expansion
It is quite true that the floating head permits differential rates of ther-
mal expansion between the shell-and-tube bundle of an exchanger. 

	
S h e l l - a n d - Tu b e  H e a t  E x c h a n g e r s 	
335
However, the floating head cannot permit differential rates of ther-
mal expansion between individual tubes.
The hotter, fouled tubes must grow. But their horizontal expan-
sion is constrained by the cleaner, colder tubes. Since the colder tubes 
do not allow the hotter tubes to grow, the hot tubes bend. This, then, 
is the origin of the twisted tubes we see when an improperly designed 
tube bundle is pulled from its shell during a turnaround.
The tendency to foul tubes might be eliminated by removal of salts, 
wax, particulates, corrosion products, polymers, free radicals, and all the 
myriad of other factors that contribute to fouling. Possibly—but not likely.
The temperature extremes of a process may occasionally be mod-
erated. For example, we desuperheat steam to an amine regenerator 
reboiler to slow degradation and fouling with the heat-sensitive 
amine. We avoid heating di(ethylene glycol) above 360°F to minimize 
fouling in our glycol dehydration unit water strippers. But in general, 
our latitude to manipulate process temperatures is very limited.
On the other hand, we can, during the design of an exchanger, 
select a high velocity to combat fouling. For example, let’s consider 
Fig. 26.5. This is data from an exchanger that was designed to operate

with a low tube-side velocity. Note how there is a rapid loss in the 
heat-transfer coefficient as the tubes foul and plug as a result of low 
velocity. The loss in heat-transfer coefficient U stops only when the 
terminal-tube velocity is reached in the unplugged tubes.
Note, also, how there is a rapid increase in the pressure drop in 
the tube bundle as the tubes foul and plug because of the low veloc-
ity. The increase in P stops only when the terminal-tube velocity is 
reached in the unplugged tubes.
It would seem that it might be best to design exchangers for ini-
tially high-velocity and high-pressure drops. It would seem that in 
practice, if we were to design exchangers for a low P, after a few 
months fouling would cause a high P anyway. This line of reasoning 
is valid for both the tube and shell sides of a heat exchanger.
26.2  Heat-Transfer Efficiency
26.2.1  “No Fooling—No Fouling”
This is the title of an important article1 published many years ago. I 
had the honor of meeting the author, Mr. Gilmore, several years my 
senior, in 1965. It could be that his sort of plain-talking, hands-on 
applied science is a vanishing craft. I hope not. The substance of this 
famous article was simple. When designing heat exchangers, use the 
available pressure drop to maintain high velocities through the heat-
exchanger equipment. Do not use safety factors in allowing for future 
pressure drop due to fouling. Use of such safety factors will force the 
mechanical engineer who designs the exchanger to use lower veloci-
ties in the design. Then the feared fouling will occur, and the P 
safety factor will be consumed.
But suppose we are operating a heat exchanger subject to rapid 
rates of initial fouling. The start-of-run heat-transfer coefficient U is 
120 Btu/[(h)(ft2(°F))]. Four months later, the U value has lined out at 
38. The calculated clean tube-side velocity is 1.5 ft/s. This is too low, 
but what can be done?
26.2.2  Multipass Exchangers
It is possible to convert the two-pass tube bundle shown in Fig. 26.1 to 
the four-pass tube bundle shown in Fig. 26.6. This conversion is effected 
as follows:
	
1.	 The center channel head pass partition baffle is cut out.
	
2.	 Two off-center channel head pass partition baffles are welded 
in place, so that 25 percent of the tubes are above the upper 
baffle and 25 percent of the tubes are below the lower baffle.
	
3.	 Both the channel head cover and the channel head tubesheet (see 
Fig. 26.1) must be remachined to accommodate the new baffles.

	
S h e l l - a n d - Tu b e  H e a t  E x c h a n g e r s 	
337
	
4.	 A new, center, pass partition baffle is welded in the floating 
head. The floating-head tubesheet must also be remachined.
The resulting four-pass tube bundle will have a tube-side velocity 
twice as high as it did when it was a two-pass exchanger: 3 ft/s. Expe-
rience has shown that in many services, doubling this velocity may 
reduce fouling rates by an order of magnitude. That is fine. But what 
about pressure drop?
When we convert a tube bundle from two to four passes, the pres-
sure drop increases by a factor of 8. For example, assume that the 
two-pass P was 5 psig. With the same flow, the four-pass P would 
be 40 psig. Let me explain:
• Pressure drop increases with the square of velocity.
• If the velocity doubles, the pressure drop would go up by a 
factor of 4.
• Pressure drop increases directly (linearly) with the length 
that the flow traverses.
• The fluid must go twice as far in a four-pass as in a two-pass 
tube bundle.
• Four times 2 equals 8.
Quite likely, even after several years of operation, the pressure 
drop of a four-pass exchanger will be greater than the P of a two-
pass exchanger in the same service. Quite likely, the initial U value of 
a four-pass exchanger, days after it has been returned to service, will 
be only slightly higher than the U value of a two-pass exchanger. 
However, the four-pass exchanger will maintain its U value with

time, far better than will the lower-velocity two-pass tube bundle 
heat exchanger.
The eightfold increase in pressure drop is certainly a stiff price to 
pay for this improvement in the long-term U value. But remember 
this: it is the clean P of the tube bundle that will increase by a factor 
of 8. Let’s say that the tube side of an exchanger is currently operating, 
after two years of service, in a badly fouled state. Its P, as measured 
in the field, is 20 psig. The calculated P for clean tubes is 5 psig in a 
two-pass configuration, or 40 psig in a four-pass configuration. After 
two years of operation, I would expect the exchanger in the four-pass 
configuration to have a P of 50 to 60 psig, rather than 160 psig.
Why? Well, because the doubling of the tube-side velocity has 
promoted turbulence, which retards the accumulation of fouling 
deposits. Of course, this is exactly the reason why we exercise. The 
increased flow of blood through our arteries prevents plaque from 
sticking to the walls of our blood vessels. The plaque, a fatty deposit 
derived from cholesterol, restricts the flow of blood, which causes 
high blood pressure and eventually strokes.
26.2.2.1  Erosive Tube-Side Liquid Velocities
Tube-side fouling and plugging is greatly reduced by high velocity. 
For clean cooling water, a velocity of over 3 ft/s is good. For heavy 
crude oil contaminated with sediments and salts, a minimum veloc-
ity is about 6 ft/s. For cracking unit slurry oil contaminated with 
catalyst fines, a velocity of less than 5 ft/s will promote tube plugging 
with catalyst.
The ΔP varies with velocity squared. So there is often a practical 
upper limit on higher velocities. But, putting aside such hydraulic 
limitations, there is also a practical limit regarding maximum veloci-
ties as limited by tube-side erosion. 
When I worked for American Oil, our limit for liquids was 10 ft/s. 
Recently, working with a very experienced process design contrac-
tor, their limit was 14 ft/s. My own design criterion has always been 
12 ft/s.
I have worked in plants where I found 12-inch c.s. piping, with 
piping velocities in corrosive services of 14 ft/s to cause erosive pip-
ing failures. For rich amine flow with particulate contamination, pip-
ing failures with velocities above 8 ft/s have occurred on units I’ve 
worked on.
In summary, for services with moderate corrosion potential, I 
would keep tube-side velocities below 12 ft/s, and perhaps a bit 
lower for U tube–type exchangers.
26.2.3  Shell Side vs. Tube Side
We can have any even number of tube-side passes: two, four, six, 
eight, and so on. But this certainly limits our flexibility to optimize 
the tube-side velocity.

	
S h e l l - a n d - Tu b e  H e a t  E x c h a n g e r s 	
339
The shell-side cross-flow velocity may be altered in much 
smaller increments by changing the tube support baffle spacing. 
This is one advantage of placing the fluid with the poorer heat-
transfer properties on the shell side. But there is another, far more 
critical advantage in placing the fluid with the poorer heat-transfer 
properties on the shell side.
26.2.3.1  Laminar Flow
Think about water flowing slowly in a channel. Will the water in the 
center of the channel flow faster or slower than the water along the 
sides of the channel? Experience teaches that water in the center of a 
channel will flow faster than along the sides of the channel. More-
over, if the water flow is really slow, the water creeping along the side 
of the channel will barely mix with the bulk of the water flowing in 
the center of the channel. This is called laminar flow.
Fluids in laminar flow transfer heat very poorly. The slow-
moving fluid creeping along the heat-transfer surface does not par-
ticularly mix with the bulk of the fluid. While the slow-moving fluid 
may get hot, it does not transfer its heat very efficiently to the flow of 
the bulk of the fluid. This is called film resistance.
Laminar flow is very bad for heat transfer. After fouling, it is the 
second biggest reason for low U values. Laminar flow is caused by 
two factors:
• Low velocities
• High viscosities
A low velocity for liquids is < 2 or < 3 ft/s. Velocities of > 10 or 
>12 ft/s may cause erosion of metal surfaces and should be avoided.
A low viscosity is < 2 or < 3 centipose (cP) or centistokes (cSt). Tap 
water has a viscosity of about 1 cP. A viscosity of ∼50 cP is quite high. 
Warm maple syrup has this sort of viscosity. The viscosity of vapors 
is almost always very low.
When we cool a liquid off, its viscosity markedly increases. I can-
not generalize—it depends on the fluid. But I can say that increasing 
the viscosity of a fluid from 2 to 40 cP could reduce the observed heat-
transfer efficiency (U) from 100 to 25. I know this from my experience 
in preheating cold, viscous, Venezuelan crude oil, off-loaded from 
tankers.
The best way to diminish the effect of laminar flow is to place the 
higher-viscosity fluid on the shell side. The shell side of an exchanger 
is far more resistant to heat-transfer loss due to film resistance than is 
the tube side because of
• The vortex shedding shown in Fig. 26.2
• The rapid changes in direction due to the tube support 
baffles

	
340	
C h a p t e r  T w e n t y - S i x
Purely in terms of heat transfer, it follows that the higher-viscosity 
fluid should be placed on the shell side. Sometimes, pressure and cor-
rosion force the designer to allocate the higher-viscosity fluid to the 
tube side. Also, your maintenance department would vastly prefer that 
the fouling fluid be placed on the tube side.
26.3  Exchanger Cleaning
To disassemble an exchanger may require a lot of work. However, if 
only the tube side has to be cleaned, the amount of labor required 
may be halved. Referring to Fig. 26.6:
	
1.	 The channel head cover is removed.
	
2.	 The bell head (or floating-head cover) is dropped.
	
3.	 The floating head is removed.
Each individual tube can now be cleaned by one person with a 
long tube and a hydroblast machine.
On the other hand, cleaning the shell side requires pulling the 
entire bundle out of the shell. This is a massive undertaking requiring 
a special bundle-pulling machine and a large crew of pipe fitters. Then 
comes the hard part, cleaning the bundle.
If the deposits are soluble in a solvent, the shell may be soaked in a 
chemical bath. Sometimes this bath must be kept hot to dissolve the 
deposits at a reasonable rate. Sometimes the deposits must be attacked 
with a hydroblast machine. If the design engineer has selected a correct 
tube pitch, cleaning the shell side of an exchanger with a hydroblast 
machine may be a reasonable proposition.
26.3.1  U-Tube Bundles
Figure 26.8 shows a U-tube bundle. Cleaning the U bend of such a 
bundle is quite difficult even by hydroblasting the tubes with a jet of 
water. My main objection to U-tube bundles is not the difficulty in 
cleaning, but the fact that such bundles cannot be inspected after 
cleaning to verify that the tubes are actually clean. In a floating-head 
bundle (shown in Fig. 26.6), looking down the straight tubes with the 
floating head removed allows the verification that the tubes have 
been completely cleaned.
The disadvantages of the floating-head design (Fig. 26.6) as com-
pared to the U-tube design (Fig. 26.8) are:
• Cost—About 10–15 percent greater
• The difficulty of getting a tight, leakproof closure between 
the floating-head tubesheet and the head itself
In general, process personnel (like your author) prefer floating 
heads. The maintenance department prefers U-tube bundles.

26.3.1.1  Effective Cleaning of U-Tube Exchanger Bundles
Hydroblasting U-tube bundles may or may not completely clean the 
tubes. However, there is a method that is certain to completely clean 
even a badly plugged and fouled tube—pigging.
Tiny pigs (i.e., small brushes) are individually forced—one pig at 
a time—through each tube with a high-pressure water gun. One of 
my clients has cut open U bends to prove the effectiveness of this 
pigging. It’s effective but expensive. About $10,000 (in 2012) for a 
crude preheat bundle (3000–4000 ft2). This is a good argument for a 
floating-head bundle, rather than a U-tube bundle.
There are two types of pigs used. One is a nylon brush and the other 
is a metal cleaner. At least in cooling water services, the metal cleaner 
type of pig is the more effective (reference “Steam Surface Condensers,” 
R. E. Putman). This service is provided by Concoindustrial.com.
26.4  Mechanical Design for Good Heat Transfer
26.4.1  Selecting Proper Tube Pitch
From a theoretical heat-exchanger perspective, the triangular tube 
pitch shown in Fig. 26.7 is best. The term pitch refers to the geometry 
and distance between the holes drilled into the tube-support baffles. 
A triangular pitch means the holes are drilled in the pattern of a 60° 
equilateral triangle. For example, we might have a 0.75-inch tube 
(OD) on a 1-inch triangular pattern. The advantages of this tube 
pitch are
• Many tubes are squeezed into a small shell ID.
• The tube spacing promotes turbulence and hence good heat 
transfer.
This all results in reduced capital cost. The disadvantage of this 
tube pitch is that, except for the outer few rows of tubes, the shell side 
cannot be cleaned by hydroblasting. Obviously, this sort of arrange-
ment should never be used in a fouling service, unless the deposits 
can be chemically removed.
The second example shown in Fig. 26.7 is 0.75-inch tubes, also set 
on a 1-inch spacing. But this time, the arrangement is a square pat-
tern. This pattern reduces the number of tubes in a shell of a fixed ID. 
Also, less turbulence is created by the tubes. Some fluid may flow 
between the tubes without encountering the tubes at all. All this 
reduces heat-transfer efficiency. But hydroblasting between the tubes 
is usually possible—depending on the extent of tube bending and 
twisting.
The third example shown in Fig. 26.7 is my favorite for sensible-
heat transfer in fouling service. This consists of 1-inch tubes set on a 
1.5-in rotated square pitch. The pitch layout is the same as that of

the square pitch. It is just the tube bundle that is rotated by 45° rela-
tive to the shell-side flow. The shell-side fluid cannot flow without 
interference between the tubes. Hence, the tubes promote turbu-
lence and improve heat transfer. The large tubes, and especially the 
doubling of the space between the tubes, reduce the heat-transfer 
surface area that can fit into a shell of a given ID. But the primary 
objective of the 1-inch tubes on a 1.5-inch rotated square pitch is 
that it is relatively easy to hydroblast.
Note that 1-inch tubes on a 1.5-inch tube pitch are 0.5-inch apart. 
One-inch tubes on a 1.25-inch tube pitch are 0.25-inch apart. The 
larger spacing greatly reduces the tendency for fouling deposits to 
bridge the gap between the tubes.
Once the space between adjacent tubes is bridged over with 
deposits, the flow of fluid between these tubes drops to zero. The 
local heat-transfer rate drops close to zero. Overall, shell-side ∆P rises 
as flow is diverted away from the restricted zone.
Using the larger tube pitch will reduce the number of tubes in a 
shell by about 35 percent. But in a fouling service, this may greatly

increase run times between cleaning and, in my experience, is a 
worthwhile incremental investment.
26.4.2  Two-Pass Shell
Most of the heat exchangers in your plant are designed with the shell-
side inlet and shell-side outlet at opposite ends of the shell, as shown in 
Fig. 26.6. However, you may have noted a few exchangers in which both 
the shell-side inlet and shell-side outlet are next to the channel head. 
This is a two-pass shell-side exchanger of the type shown in Fig. 26.8.
The critical feature of this exchanger is the longitudinal baffle, 
which extends down the length of the shell. The baffle is fitted directly 
to, and thus becomes physically part of, the tube bundle. The func-
tion of the baffle is to force the shell-side fluid to flow down the entire 
length of the shell and back again to the shell-side outlet nozzle. Such 
an exchanger is truly countercurrent. The engineer does not apply the 
F-factor derating coefficient to the log mean temperature driving 
force, as would normally be used for non-true countercurrent flow.2
This would make it seem that the two-pass shell configuration is 
inherently more efficient than the ordinary single-pass shell exchanger. 
And it is, in theory. Then why do we see so few of these exchangers in 
service?
The reason illustrates the true nature of the shell-and-tube  
heat exchanger. It is a compromise between an ideal heat-transfer 
configuration and practical mechanical limitations. In this case, 
the difficulty is in preventing leakage around the longitudinal baf-
fle. Such leaks permit the shell-side fluid to short-circuit the tube 
bundle; that is, a percentage of the inlet flow may flow directly to 
the outlet nozzle. In extremely serious cases, I have seen the bell 
head (shown in Fig. 26.8) 100°F colder than the shell-side outlet 
temperature.

Figure 26.9  Detail illustrating how a modern longitudinal baffle seals up 
against the inside of the exchanger shell.
When new, the longitudinal baffle seal, which is composed of a 
number of foil strips, extends along the length of the shell. These 
strips press up against the ID of the shell and effectively seal off the 
upper half of the shell from the lower half, as illustrated by Fig. 26.9. 
Unfortunately, the first time the shell is pulled for maintenance, 
these foil strips are wrecked. Also, unless great care is taken by 
maintenance personnel when installing the new or replacement lon-
gitudinal baffle sealing strips, the heat-transfer efficiency of the 
exchanger will be greatly reduced after it is returned to service. As 
a result of this deficiency, most operating companies severely 
restrict the use of two-pass shell-side heat exchangers.
26.4.3  Double-Pipe Exchangers
Also called “hairpin” exchangers, the double-pipe heat exchanger, as 
shown in Fig. 26.10, is the simplest of all types we have discussed. It 
is nothing more than two concentric pipes. The inner pipe might be  
2 inch diameter and the outer pipe 3 in. Double-pipe exchangers are

true countercurrent-flow heat exchangers. They are rugged and are 
reasonably cleanable. Moreover, they are not subject to bypassing. 
The only problem with them is cost per square foot of heat-transfer 
surface area. A single pipe or tube simply cannot have much area, 
typically 100 to 300 ft2. 
Exchangers of less than a few hundred square feet can be eco-
nomically designed in a hairpin configuration. Larger exchangers 
are, for economic factors, shell-and-tube types.
26.4.4  Fin Tubes
You may have seen bundles constructed with serrated, or very small, 
fins covering the exterior of the tubes. These are called low-fin-tube 
bundles. These fins increase the outside surface area of the tubes by a 
factor of 2.5. However, this does not mean that the heat-transfer effi-
ciency of the exchanger will increase by 250 percent. Two factors cur-
tail this improvement:
	
1.	 Let’s assume that the controlling resistance to heat transfer is 
inside the tube. It does not matter whether this resistance is 
due to fouling, high viscosity, or low flow. The heat flow must 
still pass through the smaller surface area inside the tube. The 
smaller area acts as a choke point that restricts heat flow. Let’s 
assume that 90 percent of the resistance to heat transfer is 
inside and 10 percent outside the tubes. The overall increase 
in the heat-transfer capacity of the exchanger would, at best, 
be roughly 15 percent.
	
2.	 Actually, retrofitting a tube bundle with low-fin tubes often 
reduces heat-transfer capacity. This happens when the 

	
346	
C h a p t e r  T w e n t y - S i x
controlling resistance to heat transfer is shell-side fouling. 
The fouling deposits get trapped between the tiny fins. This 
acts as an insulator between the shell-side fluid and the sur-
face of the tubes. In severe shell-side fouling services, I have 
replaced fin tubes with bare tubes, and doubled the heat-
transfer duty on the exchanger.
In summary, low-fin tubes may be used to advantage only when 
the controlling resistance to heat transfer is the shell-side fluid itself.
26.4.5  Heat-Transfer Resistance
The resistances of electric resistors arranged in series may be added 
to obtain the overall circuit resistance. This concept also applies for a 
heat exchanger. The following five resistances to heat transfer are 
added together to obtain the total resistance to heat transfer:
• The tube-side fluid
• The fouling deposit inside the tubes
• The metal wall of the tube
• The fouling deposit around the outside of the tube
• The shell-side fluid
The sum of these five factors is called the overall resistance to heat 
transfer. The reciprocal of the overall resistance is termed U, the over-
all heat-transfer coefficient.
26.5    Importance of ­Shell-­Side Cross-­Flow
Shell-­side flow should be mostly at right angles or perpendicular to 
the tubes. Unavoidably, as the fluid flows from the inlet nozzle to the 
outlet nozzle, there is some component of flow parallel to the tubes. 
The bigger the tube support baffle spacing, the greater the compo-
nent of the flow parallel to the tubes. A larger baffle cut also increases 
the component of the flow parallel to the tubes. Thus, to promote 
perpendicular flow to the tubes or ­cross-­flow, velocity baffle spacing 
should be about 20 to 30 percent of the bundle diameter. The baffle 
cut should be about 25 to 35 percent of the bundle diameter. By baffle 
cut, I mean the cutout section of the round ­baffle.
Reducing the baffle spacing and the baffle cut increases the 
­shell-­side pressure drop. But that’s the price we must pay for 
improved heat-transfer ­rates.
I’ve read about the importance of ­shell-­side ­cross-­flow in heat-
exchanger design books. Higher ­cross-­flow velocities reduce film 
resistance and promote increased heat-transfer rates. Recently, I had 
a dramatic personal experience to support this engineering ­principle.

A refinery in Durbin, South Africa, had a debutanizer reboiler 
with an observed heat-transfer coefficient of 25 Btu/hr/ft2/°F. The 
reboiler was a horizontal, thermosyphon, shell-and-tube exchanger. 
The heating medium was 400-psig steam on the tube side. Except for 
a short length of the tubes, the ­shell-­side flow was parallel to the 
­tubes. I designed a new bundle (using the existing shell and nozzles) 
with new tube support baffles. I mostly eliminated the parallel com-
ponent of ­shell-­side flow. The observed heat-transfer coefficient 
improved to 80 Btu/hr/ft2/°F. The increased thermosyphon driving 
force resulting from the larger reboiler duty and vapor generation 
rate offset the increased pressure drop caused by the new baffles. This 
kept the circulation rate through the shell ­constant.
Any time I find that basic engineering principles actually apply in 
practice, I am always pleasantly surprised. I hope for the best, but 
plan for the worst. My fear of failure is a basic ingredient in good 
engineering ­design.
26.5.1  Detecting Tube Leaks On-Stream
Liz and I were recently working a job at a refinery in Illinois. The 
pumparound trim cooler steam generator for the fractionator was 
thought to be leaking water into the pumparound return hot gas-oil 
flow.
To verify the leak, I proceeded as follows:
• Step 1—On the gas-oil side of the pumparound, I partially 
closed the outlet valve. This forced the upstream control valve 
to open.
• Step 2—On the steam side, I reduced the steam generator pres-
sure by partially bypassing the downstream superheater coil.
These steps reduced the steam generator pressure from 170 to 
150 psi and increased the pumparound gas-oil inlet pressure from 
140 to 160 psi. Liz then checked the blowdown drain on the steam 
generator and found it to be contaminated with the greenish gas oil. 
This proved that the steam generator was indeed leaking. Inciden-
tally, there were no tube leaks. The leaks were where the tubes were 
rolled into the tubesheet. These are called roll leaks.
There are a wide range of other techniques used to determine, 
without taking a heat exchanger offline, that the exchanger tubes are 
leaking:
• For a hydrotreater feed-effluent exchanger, inject dye into the 
feed. This dye is used in refineries to identify products for 
sale. Add the dye at its normal concentration as used for 
product sales. The dye will be destroyed in the hydrotreater 
reactor. But, if there is a tube leak in the feed-effluent 
exchanger, the hydrotreated feed will still be colored.

	
348	
C h a p t e r  T w e n t y - S i x
• For a steam turbine and vacuum-surface condenser, check for 
dissolved oxygen in the steam condensate. The oxygen would 
come from cooling water leaking into the shell side.
• For amine regenerator reboilers, at Amoco Oil we used a 
commercially available leak detector kit. Sulfur hexafluoride 
was injected into the reboiler steam and the reboiler vapor 
outlet was then monitored for SF6. The detector is sensitive to 
1 ppb (billion). The commercially available unit I’m familiar 
with is sold under the trademark of Fluortracer Analyzer. 
Both the analyzer and a SF6 dispenser are needed.
I’ve also developed my own technique to detect heat exchanger 
leaks. I’ll use the ordinary air conditioner Freon, which is available in 
most refineries, and an $800 Freon leak detector kit I’ve purchased 
from my neighborhood air conditioner supply store. It’s really the 
same as the SF6 technique. One of my clients has used a lithium bro-
mide leak detection kit.

CHAPTER 27
Heat Exchanger 
Innovations
W
e have discussed basic concepts of heat exchanger and 
air cooler design and operation in earlier chapters. From 
time to time various innovative ideas to improve the 
basic shell-and-tube exchanger or air cooler design have been 
developed. During our seminars, we are often asked for comments 
on the feasibility of using one or other of these different designs. 
Therefore, dear reader, in this chapter we offer you our comments 
regarding a variety of attempts at heat exchanger and air cooler 
design innovation that have been developed over the last 50 years 
or so, such as:
• Smooth high alloy tubes
• Low-finned tubes
• Sintered metal tubes
• Spiral heat exchanger
• Tube inserts
• Twisted tubes
• Helical tube support baffles
Caution: Whereas all the designs we include have found some 
successful applications, the key to success here is to find the right 
application, and as ever we will add the further cautionary note that 
the best approach is most often to copy a successful application or 
design rather than to innovate. Therefore, dear reader, please use cau-
tion when attempting to use any innovative designs or applications 
where they have not already been used with success. Ask around if 
you have an idea to improve heat exchange on your process unit; see 
if you can find someone else who already had success with the same 
approach.

27.1  Smooth High Alloy Tubes
Use of smooth high alloy tubes in otherwise corrosive service has been 
common practice since the 1950s. Tube metallurgy is selected to mini-
mize corrosion while in service. The tubes therefore maintain their 
smooth, shiny finish. Without sites for fouling deposits to attach or accu-
mulate, the clean heat-transfer coefficient is maintained. This idea has 
been used with success in refinery catalytic cracker feed preheat service, 
placing slurry oil on the tube side and vacuum gas oil on the shell side.
Caution: To prevent galvanic corrosion of the tube bundle, the 
entire tube bundle should be constructed of the same metallurgy; this 
would include the tube support baffles, tube sheets, and tie rods.
We also note that while there is an obvious advantage to main-
taining smooth, shiny tubes for applications in sensible heat transfer, 
this may not be true if it is necessary to vaporize liquid in the 
exchanger. Some of our clients have experienced difficulties due to 
film heat-transfer resistance and lack of nucleate boiling sites when 
attempting to use smooth tubes to vaporize relatively pure compo-
nent liquids. This would be true for high alloy tubes or simply new 
replacement bundles for bundles of lesser metallurgy.
27.2  Low-Finned Tubes
The low-finned tubes are made by machining grooves into the exte-
rior surface of the tubes, which increases the surface area by 2.5 times.
The use of low-finned tubes is not a new development. It is an idea 
that was in common use in the 1960s with mixed results. A successful 
application is the use of low-finned tubes in clean propane refrigerant 
condensing service, with clean cooling water on the tube side. 
Observed heat-transfer rates increased by about 70 percent.
However, if the controlling resistance to heat transfer is on the 
tube side, the increased outside surface area of the tubes does not 
improve heat-transfer rates.
Caution: If the shell side is subject to fouling, then dirt gets 
between the fins, in which case the heat transfer will now be worse 
than with smooth (unfinned) tubes.
27.3  Sintered Metal Tubes
The development of sintered metal tubes dates from the 1970s. A 
rough coating is applied to the exterior of the smooth new tubes. 
The hottest fluid is on the tube side. Boiling is intended to take place 
on the shell side or exterior of the tubes. This is only useful in flux-
limited situations when boiling relatively pure components and 
when heat-transfer rates exceed 10,000 Btu/hr/ft². In such circum-
stances, the sintered metal tubes act like boiling stones by the way 
in which they provide sites to initiate nucleate boiling and thereby 

	
H e a t  E x c h a n g e r  I n n o v a t i o n s 	
351
overcome flux limitations. The application of sintered metal tubes is 
limited and in some applications they are either unnecessary, not 
beneficial, or really should not be used. For example, do not use 
sintered metal tubes in the following applications:
• If exterior of tubes are slightly corroded and pitted, then there 
are already plenty of nucleate boiling sites
• If a large portion of duty is in the form of sensible heat rather 
than latent heat 
• If fouling on the shell side is significant
27.4  Spiral Heat Exchanger
The spiral heat exchanger concept represents a completely different 
type of construction as compared to heat exchangers or coolers with 
tubes or tube bundles. In this very different design, there is only one 
channel per medium, thus the design aims to eliminate the possibility 
of channeling and suppress fouling. The objective of the design was 
to produce an exchanger suitable for heating or cooling of slurries 
and other process streams containing solids and/or fibers.
Spiral heat exchangers are constructed by winding two long strips 
of plate metal around a center to form a spiral body, which then contains 
two concentric channels. Each channel is welded closed at alternate 
sides (see Fig. 27.1). Covers are then bolted over each side of the spiral 
body to complete the unit. When both of these covers are removed, the 
entire surface area of the exchanger is available for manual cleaning.
Figure 27.1  Spiral heat exchanger cross-sectional flow diagram.

	
352	
C h a p t e r  T w e n t y - S e v e n
Spiral heat exchangers have been used with success in refinery fluid 
catalytic cracking (FCC) unit service to cool the main fractionator bot-
toms product, where they have proved to be less subject to fouling than 
other types of exchangers. Although one client commented that they 
had needed to make awkward repair welds between internal channels.
In general, we are informed that this type of exchanger can be con-
structed of any material that can be cold formed and welded, such as 
carbon steel, stainless steel, high nickel alloys, or titanium. We are also 
informed that this type of exchanger may be used at design pressures 
as high as 430 psig or in vacuum service, and at temperatures as high 
as 750°F or as low as -40°F. 
This type of exchanger is produced by AlfaLaval.
27.5  Tube Inserts
We are aware of three different kinds of tube inserts, but all three are 
based on the idea of a metal spiral inside the tube. The commercial 
names are:
• Spirelf
• Turbotal
• Fixotal
Spirelf was originally developed by Elf Research whereas Turbotal 
and Fixotal were originally developed by Total Research. Spirelf and 
Turbotal are the products of independent research programs launched 
by Elf and Total in the 1980s with the primary aim being to reduce 
fouling in crude preheat exchanger trains. All three of these tube 
inserts are now marketed by Petroval (see Fig. 27.2).
27.5.1  Spirelf Tube Insert
The Spirelf tube insert is a metallic coil stretched over the length of 
the tube and held in place at each end by straight wires. In operation, 
when fluid flows through the tube, the Spirelf coil vibrates axially 
and radially.
The concept is that this vibration reduces fouling and increases 
flow turbulence, producing an improvement in the heat-transfer 
coefficient. However, there is also an associated increase in tube-side 
pressure drop of about 3 psi per pass at tube-side velocities of 3 ft/s.
The main applications for Spirelf so far have been oil refinery pre-
heat trains for CDU, VDU, FCC, water treatment feed exchanger HDS 
units, and also high-tube velocity applications as found in reboilers.
27.5.2  Turbotal Tube Insert
The Turbotal tube insert coil, also referred to as a helicoid mobile, is 
designed to rotate within the tube. This is achieved by a mechanism at 
the tube inlet that holds the Turbotal insert in place but allows it to 

	
H e a t  E x c h a n g e r  I n n o v a t i o n s 	
353
rotate. The velocity of the fluid in the tube determines the speed of 
rotation. There is also some micro-vibration of the coil within the tube.
The concept is that the tube-side fouling rate will be reduced by 
continuous scrubbing of the tube wall and also have a favorable 
impact on heat transfer. The associated increase in tube-side pressure 
drop with this device is about 1.5 psi per pass at 3 ft/s tube-side 
velocity, about half that of Spirelf or Fixotal. 
The main applications for Turbotal so far have been in the pre-
heat trains of oil refinery CDU, VDU, FCC units, and water treat-
ment exchangers. Maximum tube-side velocity up to 7 ft/s, but can 
not be back flushed or sustain reverse flow for cleaning as that would 
un-hook the turbotal coil.
27.5.3  Fixotal Tube Insert
The Fixotal tube insert is a metallic coil, which is static and self-tight-
ening inside the tube. There is no intended mechanical cleaning effect 
with this insert.
The concept is to increase turbulence in the tube-side flow, espe-
cially at the tube wall by constantly mixing slow moving fluid near the 
tube wall back into the bulk, thus increasing tube-side heat-transfer 
rate and reducing fouling. The additional tube-side pressure drop

with the Fixotal insert is about 3 psi per pass at tube-side flow veloci-
ties of 3 ft/s.
The Fixotal inserts have been used in single- and two-phase flow 
applications—that is, condensation and evaporation. Only the Fixotal 
inserts are used in air coolers and are intended to reduce fouling, par-
ticularly with paraffin coating or water cooler scaling. We also note 
that Fixotal has been used in U tubes, and can now be left in place 
during hydroblasting for cleaning.
27.5.4  General Comments on Spirelf, Turbotal, and Fixotal 
Tube Inserts
In some of the early Spirelf and Turbotal installations, although there 
was initial reduction in fouling rates, there were also problems with 
mechanical integrity of the tube inserts; broken pieces of the tube 
inserts were all too often found in pass partition boxes of the heat 
exchangers. We have been informed that improvements to the design 
of Spirelf and Turbotal were made to combat these problems and 
apparently the end results are favorable, although we note that the life 
expectancy of the Turbotal inserts may be a two year maximum, 
whereas Spirelf and Fixotal have up to five years’ service time.
Naturally these tube inserts may be attractive as retrofit items, with 
potential savings in energy costs and reduction of downtime for exchanger 
cleaning, but it is important to be careful when selecting these, as with 
any piece of equipment, to be sure that the tube inserts are appropriate for 
the service for which you intend to use them. Note that both Spirelf and 
Fixotal can withstand back flushing for cleaning but Turbotal can not.
Petroval now has over 20 years’ experience with the design, instal-
lation, and operation of these types of tube inserts. There is also stan-
dard service offered by Petroval from initial valuation to select the most 
favorable type of insert to suit clients’ working conditions, economic 
evaluation of projected savings, insert manufacture, super-vision or (if 
preferred) management of installation, and monitoring of performance. 
When these inserts work well, they seem to work very well, but 
sometimes they are selected for an unsuitable application, just as in 
the case of the particular air cooler that we describe below. It is clearly 
most important to carefully evaluate the suitability of the service that 
you intend to retrofit, consult and work closely with manufacturers 
of the equipment, ask around and seek out other similar applications 
to compare performance of the retrofit in the field. You cannot fight 
heavy fouling service with these inserts. The metallurgy of coil and 
corrosivity of fluid must also be considered.
27.5.5  Air Cooler Retrofit
In a used motor oil reprocessing facility, the vacuum tower precon-
denser consisted of a large fin-fan air cooler. Inlet conditions were 
260°F and 80 mm Hg. Due to the contaminants in the used motor oil, 

	
H e a t  E x c h a n g e r  I n n o v a t i o n s 	
355
this is a potentially very fouling service. Tube inserts, called turbula-
tors (basically wire springs), were installed in the finned tubes by the 
manufacturer. The initial performance was reported by our client to 
be good. However, 18 months later we observed a high-pressure drop 
(20 to 30 mm Hg) through the air cooler vacuum precondenser. Our 
client reported to us that after our visit, they had attempted to:
• Clean the tubes by hydroblasting, but could not establish a 
water flow through the tubes.
• Extract the wire spring turbulators from the tubes, but with-
out any success. That is, the springs were stuck.
The air cooler bundle was then replaced with an ordinary finned 
tube bundle. The use of wire inserts in fouling service, where extra 
pressure drop is totally unacceptable, represents poor engineering 
design practice. This is especially so when the controlling resistance to 
heat transfer is going to be on the air side of the precondenser cooler.
27.5.6  Concluding Thoughts on Wire Spring Turbulators 
Wire spring turbulators may have an advantage over tubes with no 
inserts in that they keep the tubes cleaner. This seems to work best to 
prevent fouling if it is as a film. If fouling is in the form of particulates in 
the feed, then the tubes have a tendency to plug. There is also the effect 
of increased pressure drop to be taken into account when considering 
tube inserts as a retrofit. However, the decrease in temperature gradient 
between the tube wall and the bulk fluid may work well to reduce foul-
ing when the fouling is tube-wall temperature dependent. This was seen 
particularly on a furfural unit when a fixed tube insert was used on the 
rundown cooler and reduced the storage temperature by about 54°F.
27.6  Twisted Tubes and Twisted Tube Bundle
The concept starts with the use of a tube that is itself twisted, the idea 
being to promote turbulence within the tube as a result of the tube 
wall shape. When you look at one of these tubes, the shape is like a 
large hollow drill bit (see Fig. 27.3). These twisted tubes are then 
Figure 27.3

like a hollow drill 
bit.

arranged in such close triangular pitch on the tube sheets that they 
are actually touching each other at many points along the length of 
the tubes (see Fig. 27.4). One might think that to have the tubes touch-
ing would cause a problem with shell-side fouling, but the manufac-
turers claim that because the points of contact occur on the curved 
ridges of the tubes, rather than being a problem the points of contact 
actually increase shell-side turbulence. 
The manufacturers also claim that because of all these points of 
contact they are able to avoid the use of baffles for tube support 
and therefore eliminate problems of vibration. (Tube vibration in 
traditionally designed shell-and-tube exchangers particularly at 
the point where the tubes pass through the tube support baffles can 
cause the tubes to fail and leak.)
The other basic concept that is essential to the functioning of a 
tube bundle made with these twisted tubes is that in manufacture of 
the bundle, the tubes have to be grouped or lined up in the bundle 
so that the ridges do meet and touch to form the curved points of 
contact described above. Also and most significantly, this alignment

produces shell-side “cleaning lanes” at various angles all the way 
through the bundle between the ridges on the tube surface (see 
Fig. 27.5). Various advantages are claimed for these twisted tube 
bundle exchangers:
• Reduced fouling due to increased turbulence on both shell 
side and tube side.
• Increased heat transfer as a result of increased turbulence and 
lower fouling rate.
• Reduced pressure drop as compared to traditional shell-and-
tube heat exchangers both shell side and tube side.
• Increased heat-transfer capacity as a result of around 30 or 
even 40 percent increase in surface area as a retrofit bundle in 
an existing shell. This extra surface area is achieved because 
the tubes are so closely packed.
• Elimination of the risk of vibration as a result of each tube 
being tightly locked into place by its six immediate neigh-
bors, and also allowing greater velocity than traditional shell-
and-tube exchangers.
• Use of a shroud around the bundle inside the shell allows the 
use of existing inlet and outlet nozzles. (A shroud that incor-
porates an impingement plate can be made in two pieces that 
bolt together for ease of removal during bundle cleaning 
operations.)
• Smaller shell size on new equipment as compared to tradi-
tional shell-and-tube exchangers.

We have heard that these exchangers have been used in a variety 
of oil refinery applications both in horizontal and vertical exchang-
ers, some of which include:
• Semiregenerative naphtha reformer feed effluent exchang-
ers, where reduced pressure drop brings additional benefits, 
increasing the hydrogen recycle ratio without changes to the 
recycle gas compressor
• Hydrocracker
• Hydrotreating (feed-reactor effluent exchangers)
• Alkylation units, both on sulfuric acid (feed-reactor effluent 
exchangers) and hydrofluoric acid units
• Crude preheat train, with crude on tube side or sometimes on 
shell side (see next section)
27.6.1  Twisted Tubes Are Used in Crude Preheat Mainly  
with Crude on the Tube Side 
The main benefit that is found seems to be the increase in surface 
area, typically 40 percent more surface area in the bundle due to the 
fact that there are more tubes in the bundle compared with a conven-
tional bundle that would fit the same shell. Actual experience shows 
that the twisted tubes may foul more readily and will plug if fouling 
deposits are from particulates in feed. But the twisted tube design 
does work in this service to combat fouling if deposits are formed as 
a fouling film inside tubes.
Special techniques are required for tube-side cleaning, but clean-
ing the tube side is not any more difficult than cleaning conventional 
tubes.
At one Midwest refinery, on a 180,000 BSD crude unit, two parallel, 
6000 square ft, titanium twisted tube bundles have been in service for 
a number of years. Crude tower overhead vapors plus steam are con-
densing on the shell side. Crude is on the tube side. Fouling on both 
the shell side and the tube side appears to be quite minimal. How-
ever, the heat-transfer coefficient is bad; only about 20–25 Btu/hr/
ft2/°F, even when the exchanger is clean.
We attribute this mainly to the relatively low (3 ft per second) 
tube-side velocity and cold (50°F), somewhat heavy (25°API) crude 
with a high viscosity. The overall performance of these exchangers 
did not improve all that much, according to our client, after the new 
twisted tube bundles were installed. However, they also converted 
the exchangers from four to two tube-side passes, and this decreased 
the tube-side velocity by half. Presumably, the reduced tube-side 
velocity offset the benefits of the twisted tube design.

	
H e a t  E x c h a n g e r  I n n o v a t i o n s 	
359
Converting back to four passes is very difficult, because the tube 
ODs are so tightly packed with twisted tubes, and there is very little 
space to accommodate additional new pass partition baffles.
27.6.2  Twisted Tubes with the Crude on the Shell Side 
We have heard of a few applications of this. We note that if fouling 
deposits are particulates in the feed, this appears to be a bad application. 
27.6.3  General Problems and Concerns with Twisted Tube 
Exchangers
The main concerns seem to be, “Is it going to plug up, and are we 
going to be able to clean it?” The answer is that in general people find 
it is possible to clean both the shell side and tube side following 
manufacturer’s guidelines (time period and method) and using fairly 
standard cleaning equipment. However, there have been instances 
when cleaning has been difficult or even impossible. 
Special care should be taken on acceptance of a new twisted tube 
bundle to verify that the tubes are lined up correctly and that all 
shell-side cleaning lanes are unobstructed. 
We know that although there is concern as to how to clean these 
twisted tube bundles, in some cases, the run length has been so long 
that even years after installation there still has been no need to clean the 
bundle. Apparently when it works well, it works very well.
Other problems and concerns with twisted tube exchangers have 
been:
• The need to take extra care when pulling and reinserting the 
bundle because, especially with the surrounding shroud, 
twisted tube bundles are less robust than traditional shell-
and-tube exchanger bundles.
• The need to take more care when commissioning twisted 
tube bundles in very hot service because they are less rugged 
than traditional shell-and-tube exchanger bundles, and there 
may be a greater risk to tubes being pulled out from the 
tube-sheets by uneven thermal expansion.
• The cost of the twisted tube bundle as compared to a new 
larger traditional shell-and-tube exchanger of comparable 
surface area with wide rotated square pitch for ease of clean-
ing. In some cases the traditional shell-and-tube exchanger 
(shell + bundle + installation) was the least expensive option.
• Putting crude on the shell side of a twisted tube bundle may 
cause problems with fouling. Do not put vacuum resid on the 
shell side with twisted tubes.

Twisted tube bundles are manufactured by a division of 
Koch-Glitsch and are also marketed by Brown Fintube in Luxembourg 
and the United Kingdom.
27.7  Helical Tube Support Baffles
Tube bundles with helical baffles are now produced by both ABB 
Lummus Heat Transfer and Koch-Glitsch. HTRI now has a rating for 
this type of design option in their software.
Although the traditional shell-and-tube heat exchangers have 
segmental tube support baffles at 90° to the line of the tubes, the heli-
cally baffled tube bundle has tube support baffles sloped so as to 
induce a helical flow pattern on the shell side (see Fig. 27.6).
The concept is to ensure effective bundle penetration and avoid 
dead zones so as to leave no stagnant areas where shell-side fouling 
could accumulate. Also, helical baffle plates can be spaced to reduce 
unsupported tube spans (without affecting pressure drop or heat-
transfer characteristics) to mitigate flow-induced vibration. The 
designers also claim that the helicoidal baffle arrangement permits 
increased heat transfer.
We have heard of helical baffle exchangers being used in oil 
refineries to preheat delayed coker feed with vacuum resid on the 
shell side (with the helical baffles). In this service, the helical baffles 
seem to work well, resulting in less fouling, slower rate of increase in 
Figure 27.6  Schematic arrangement showing helical tube support baffles in 
relation to tube alignment.

pressure drop, and better maintenance of heat-transfer coefficient as 
compared to traditional shell-and-tube exchangers. These effects 
have proved consistent over several years.
Another example from oil refineries is in crude preheat service with 
vacuum resid again on the shell side (with the helical baffles). Once 
again, similar results are seen as described above, with less fouling, 
reduced rate of increase in pressure drop, and better maintenance of 
heat-transfer coefficient as compared to the conventional shell-and-tube 
exchanger design. Our more direct experience of this comes from cur-
rent practice in the United States, but we have also seen evidence of 
similar applications in Australia, as discussed in a recent article on the 
subject of crude preheat exchanger train redesign.1
We have also heard of a case where a heat exchanger was retrofit-
ted with a helical baffled bundle and the shell-side fouling actually 
increased. The client theorized that being as how the angle used to 
slope the baffles can apparently be varied by the designer according 
to service conditions, the angle for the baffle had not been correctly 
selected. 
In general, helical baffle tube bundles are most cost-effectively 
used as replacement bundles in existing shells. However, for this to 
actually improve heat-transfer rates, the controlling resistance to heat 
transfer must be on the shell side and not the tube side of the heat 
exchanger. Basically this means that the shell-side flow must suffer 
from some combination of:
• High viscosity
• Low velocity
• High rates of fouling
• Low available pressure drop
For an equivalent shell-side ΔP, the helical baffle will be less foul-
ing and will: provide less film resistance, and less fouling resistance 
than will a conventional vertical tube support baffle.
In summary, the helical baffle design will not help improve the 
performance of a shell-and-tube heat exchanger, if the controlling 
resistance (fouling or film) is on the tube side.

Chapter 28
Shell-and-Tube 
Heat Exchangers: 
Design Details
I 
will only be discussing details for an ordinary shell-and-tube 
exchanger, assuming liquids on both the shell and tube sides. 
Condensers and reboilers will be discussed separately.
There are three sorts of exchangers that are in common use:
	
1.	 Pull-through (or split-ring) floating head
	
2.	 U-tube bundle
	
3.	 Fixed tubesheet (i.e., both ends of the tube bundle are perma-
nently fixed to each end of the shell)
	
1.	 Fixed Tubesheet—The advantage of a fixed tubesheet 
exchanger is that it is a true countercurrent flow exchanger 
and no reduction of the log mean temperature difference 
(LMTD) is required for non-true counter-current flow between 
the shell-side fluid and the tube-side fluid. However, it’s 
impossible to mechanically clean the shell side, as the bundle 
cannot be extracted from the shell. When such an exchanger 
fouls on the tube side, it can easily be cleaned. When it fouls 
on the shell side, you can throw the entire exchanger away.
	
2.	 U-Tube Bundle—The tube side of a U-tube bundle can be 
cleaned, including the return bends. The problem is not tube-
side cleaning, but tube-side inspecting. There is no practical 
way to see if the tubes have actually been hydroblasted clean. 
While a U-tube exchanger is less expensive than a conven-
tional floating-head exchanger (10–15 percent), it should not 
be used if tube-side fouling is a factor.
	
3.	 Floating-Head Bundle—Designated as an “AET” pull-through 
floating-head exchanger (or “AES” floating with a split-ring 
backing device), this sort of a bundle has one fixed tubesheet 
363

	
364	
C h a p t e r  T w e n t y - E i g h t
and one floating tubesheet. One end is left free to float to 
accommodate the differential rate of thermal expansion 
between the shell side and the tube side. In this exchanger, 
the tubes are straight and can immediately be inspected to 
see if they have been properly cleaned. However, unlike the 
fixed tubesheet configuration, this floating-head bundle is 
not a true countercurrent flow configuration. Hence, its 
LMTD must be reduced by the F-factor correction factor for 
non-true countercurrent flow.
The floating-head exchanger is quite a bit more expensive to pur-
chase than the U-tube or fixed tubesheet exchangers. Also, your 
maintenance department will generally dislike making the gasketed 
closure between the floating-head cover and the floating-head 
tubesheet. Finally, it’s not uncommon for this closure to leak when 
the tube-side pressure exceeds the shell-side pressure. Still, the “AES” 
or “AET” exchanger is typically the correct design for almost all 
applications.
28.1  Selecting the Process Fluid Location
28.1.1  Shell or Tube Side
The fluid with the high viscosity belongs on the shell side. The 
objective is to avoid laminar flow and high heat-transfer film resis-
tance. Typically, the higher viscosity fluid has the greater fouling 
tendency. Thus, the normal practice is to place the dirty, higher vis-
cosity fluid on the tube side for ease of cleaning. However, if the 
shell side is designed correctly, it is quite straightforward to clean. 
I’ll detail the design criteria below for ease of shell-side cleaning. 
But first I’ll explain the critical parameter called vortex shedding.
28.1.2  Vortex Shedding
When fluid flows at a 90° angle across a tube, it creates turbulence, 
which is called vortex shedding. The swirls created when a river flows 
across a tree stump is a common example. The swirls destroy the film 
resistance to heat transfer created by laminar layers of fluid sur-
rounding the tube. My experience indicates that a shell-side cross-
flow velocity of 3 to 5 ft/s is sufficient to obtain this benefit.
To calculate the cross-flow area, determine the open area between 
the tubes at the edge of the tube support baffles. For example:
•	 Baffle spacing = 10 inches
•	 Number of tubes at edge of the tube support baffle = 20
•	 Tubes are 1 inch on a 1½-inch center, or ½-inch space between 
each tube

	
S h e l l - a n d - Tu b e  H e a t  E x c h a n g e r s :  D e s i g n  D e t a i l s 	
365
Therefore, cross-flow area = 
•	 (10 inches) × (20 tubes) ¥ (½ inch) = 100 square inches ÷ 144 = 
0.70 ft2 (neglecting gaps at end of tube rows)
•	 If the fluid flow was 3 ft3/s, then the cross-flow velocity 
would be 3 ÷ 0.70 = 4.3 ft/s (this is approximate as I’ve not 
accurately accounted for gaps at either side of the row of 
tubes)
In my book, Process Design for Reliable Operations, I’ve given a 
vivid example of the terrible consequences of placing high-viscosity 
industrial fuel oil on the tube side of a water cooled exchanger.
The second reason that shell-side flow is not subject to laminar 
flow is that the liquid only flows the diameter (several feet) of the 
shell, before its direction is reversed by the tube support baffles. 
That’s not far enough to establish laminar flow. In the ordinary 
range of operations, there is no such thing as laminar flow on the 
shell side.
28.1.3  Adjusting for Cross-Flow Velocity
The designer ought to specify the baffle spacing to achieve the desired 
cross-flow velocity. In a 20-ft-long bundle, a minimum of about five 
baffles are needed to actually support the tubes. The remaining baf-
fles are to induce an adequate cross-flow velocity. I’ve designed tube 
bundles for 30 baffles (i.e., 8 inch spacing) with no problems. Just 
remember that doubling the number of baffles increases ΔP by a 
factor of 8. Let me explain:
	
1.	 Delta P varies with velocity squared (which has doubled)
	
2.	 Now multiply by the flow path length
	
3.	 (2)2 ¥ (2) = 8
I use a baffle cut of about 25 to 30 percent, but not for any particu-
lar reason. It’s just that it seems to work out okay.
28.2  Design the Shell Side for Ease of Cleaning
There are two ways to design the shell side of an exchanger for foul-
ing service:
Stupid
Smart

¾ inch
1.0 inch

1½ inch

366	
C h a p t e r  T w e n t y - E i g h t
Using ¾-inch tubes on a 1-inch rotated square is okay, but not as 
easy to clean as the smarter method. Of course, being smart costs 
money. Meaning the smart tube bundle ID will be roughly 20% big-
ger than the stupid bundle. But that’s a small price to pay for putting 
the higher viscosity fluid on the shell side rather than on the tube side 
and then suffering from laminar flow.
28.2.1  Tube Materials
One excellent way of suppressing shell-side fouling (and tube-side 
fouling as well) is to maintain tube smoothness by retarding corro-
sion. Basically, use alloy tubes (316 s.s. if chlorides and caustic are not 
present), rather than carbon steel (c.s.).
Don’t make the mistake of using c.s. tube support baffles and 
316 s.s. tubes. A galvanic cell will be created that will destroy the c.s. 
tube support baffles. I’ve seen the result of this error on an HDS unit 
reactor effluent.
Don’t rely on sacrificial anodes. They are not reliable and are typ-
ically not replaced in a timely manner.
Construct the entire bundle out of 316 s.s. It’s likely two to three 
times more costly than c.s., but the shell and installation costs 
(90 percent of the total) will not change. And rates of fouling will be 
reduced, often quite dramatically.
28.2.2  Tube-Side Velocity Constraints
Exchangers can be any even number of tube-side passes that produce 
the desired tube-side velocity. Depending on the tendency of the 
tube-side fluid to foul, a minimum tube-side velocity will be 3 to 5 ft 
per second.
A maximum is 10 to 12 ft per second to avoid erosion, based on 
the nature of particulates in the feed. 
More importantly, remember to stay well above laminar flow, as 
defined by Reynolds’s number (i.e., above 2000).

Re
(Tube ID) (Flow) (Density)
Viscosity
	
High viscosity being the big factor. 
Also, ΔP, as discussed above for the shell-side flow (see preceding 
section on cross-flow velocity), varies with the number of passes, cubed 
(not squared). That is, flow path length doubles when going from two 
to four tube-side passes. Meaning, if I convert a two-pass exchanger to 
four-pass, the fluid has to flow twice as fast and twice as far.
28.2.3  Terminal Tube Velocity
The effects of excessively low tube-side velocity will be to damage the 
tube bundle due to terminal tube velocity problems.

	
S h e l l - a n d - Tu b e  H e a t  E x c h a n g e r s :  D e s i g n  D e t a i l s 	
367
When a tube in fouling service (where the colder fluid is on the 
tube side) begins to foul due to low tube velocities, the flow through 
the tube is reduced. The tube gets hotter, which further reduces the 
flow as it fouls quicker. The resulting suppressed velocity then accel-
erates the rate of tube-side fouling until the tube plugs off entirely.
Now the totally fouled tube heats up to the shell-side tempera-
ture, while the tubes that are not plugged remain cooler. The result-
ing divergence in tube temperature causes the hotter tubes to bend 
and distort due to the differential rates of thermal expansion between 
the cold tubes (not plugged) and the hotter tubes (totally plugged).
I see this frequently when tube bundles are extracted from the 
shell during a unit turnaround. The distorted tubes interfere with the 
proper fluid flow through the shell side of the exchanger and likely 
promote both shell-side fouling and shell-side bypassing. Also, as the 
tubes plug off, tube-side ΔP increases. If half the tubes plug, then the 
differential pressure across the channel head pass partition baffle will 
increase by a factor of four and may result in the failure of the channel 
head pass partition baffle.
The designer should keep these factors in mind when selecting 
the number of tube-side passes. Selecting too few passes and a low 
tube-side ΔP is often not a conservative design. Better to err at too 
high a tube velocity, than too low a tube velocity.
28.2.4  Exchanger Nozzle Sizing
Especially during retrofits, designers often neglect to check that 
revamped existing exchangers have adequate-size nozzles.
• Tube side—The channel head nozzles need to be roughly as 
large in area as the cross-sectional area of the tube passes. 
• Shell side—The shell inlet and outlet nozzles should be set 
roughly as large as the cross-flow area as defined above.
This is conservative sizing. But I hate to waste valuable ΔP on 
parasitic pressure losses across nozzles.
Also, if the piping sizing is larger than my calculated nozzle sizes, 
I’ll match up with the piping. If the piping is smaller than my calcu-
lated exchanger nozzle sizes, then I’ll retain my larger exchanger 
nozzle sizes.
28.2.5  Impingement Plates and Seal Strips
The shell-side impingement plate must be a bit larger than the inlet 
nozzle to protect the upper rows of tubes from the erosive action of 
the shell-side inlet fluid. To accommodate the impingement plate, sev-
eral rows of tubes must be omitted along the top of the bundle. The 
space so created allows the shell-side flow to bypass the entire tube 
bundle by sneaking across the top of the bundle.

	
368	
C h a p t e r  T w e n t y - E i g h t
To dam off this bypass area, a pair of seal strips is needed. These 
are typically ¼-inch thick, as long as the tubes, and perhaps 3 or 
4 inches wide. They are set in grooves cut in the tube support baffles 
on either side of the impingement plate (Fig. 28.1).
However, when I wrote that the seal strips needed to be as long as 
the tubes, that is not quite right. One of the pairs of seal strips must 
have one strip that stops at the first tube support baffle. If not, the 
shell-side feed would be trapped above the impingement plate.
If we have vertically cut the tube support baffles (which is nor-
mal, at least in the United States), then the seal strip that is aligned 
with the edge of the first shell-side tube support baffle should extend 
to the tubesheet.
Normal design practice is to end both seal strips at the first tube 
support baffle. This is wrong design practice. It allows the shell-side 
flow to bypass the exchanger area between the tubesheet and the first 
tube support baffle. To avoid this problem, the seal strip at the edge 
of the first tube support baffle must be extended to the tubesheet (see 
Fig. 28.1).
28.2.6  Back-Flush Connections—Water Coolers
I prefer to place water cooler back-flush connections on the channel 
head cover. This is mainly because the piping design is not under my

control, and thus the tube-side back-flush connection may be omitted 
by the mechanical designer. 
My rule of thumb is that I don’t want the back-flush connection to 
be less than half the ID of the cooling water supply line.
You need to give back-flushing a little extra thought if the 
exchanger is to be located well above grade. Will the cooling water 
return header pressure be great enough to back-flush the tubes? For 
example, if the cooling water supply pressure at grade is 30 psig, and 
the exchanger is 70 ft above grade, then the water return header 
pressure will be under a vacuum and cannot be used for back-
flushing. Obviously, there is no neat answer to this limitation. Use of 
plant firewater is not advisable, because one should never divert 
firewater for safety reasons.
28.2.7  Helical Baffles
There are a number of novel heat-exchanger designs that I am famil-
iar with:
• Twisted tube
• Tube inserts
• On-line circulating balls for tube-side cleaning
• Helical baffles
• Spiral heat exchangers
The only one of the above that is in widespread use, and used 
with success in the correct application, is the helical baffle exchanger 
(see Figure 27.6). The tube support baffles are set at an angle to induce 
a helical flow pattern on the shell side. The idea is to avoid the dead 
zones that occur in a conventional vertical tube support baffle. Thus, 
ΔP and fouling are both reduced on the shell side.
However, I have three reservations:
	
1.	 If the controlling resistance to heat transfer is on the tube 
side, the helical baffle arrangement serves very little purpose.
	
2.	 For a new installation, it’s likely cheaper just to buy a some-
what larger, conventional bundle than a proprietary helical 
baffle bundle.
	
3.	 The design angle of the baffles is quite critical to obtain the 
full benefit of the helical baffle bundle.
The helical baffle bundle is best used during retrofits to existing 
exchangers, if the controlling resistance to heat transfer is on the shell 
side.
Spiral heat exchangers are excellent in fouling services. However, 
after cleaning, they are difficult to reassemble without internal leakage.

28.2.8  Correction Factor for Non-True Countercurrent Flow
When we calculate the LMTD in a heat exchanger, we assume that 
true countercurrent flow exists between the shell side and the tube 
side. For an ordinary exchanger, as shown in Fig. 28.2, this is not 
true.
As a consequence of the channel head tube-side inlet and outlet 
being located on the same end of the exchanger, the lower half of the 
shell is in co-current flow. Depending on the temperature profile, this 
typically reduces the LMTD by 5 to 25 percent. To calculate this loss 
in heat-transfer efficiency due to this problem, we use the F-factor 
correction factor as presented in your TEMA Data Book.
If you are unwilling to incur the penalty of loss of heat-transfer 
LMTD as calculated by the F-factor, then you have three choices:
	
1.	 Place two exchangers in series on both the shell and tube 
sides. In general, this is the preferred solution and the one I 
would adopt.
	
2.	 Use double-pipe exchangers. These are indeed true counter-
current flow exchangers (also called hairpins). I often use 
these. They are reliable and robust, but if the required capacity 
exceeds several hundred square feet, they are too small for 
many applications.
	
3.	 Use two-pass shell exchangers, as discussed below.
28.2.9  Two-Pass Shell Exchangers
Figure 28.3 shows that such an exchanger is in true countercurrent 
flow.
The shell-side inlet and outlet nozzles are located on the same 
side, close to the channel head. The cross-baffle shown (longitudinal) 
is required to direct the shell-side flow along the length of the shell.
This looks good on paper. But the problem arises in sealing the 
cross-baffle to the interior of the shell. This is accomplished by means

half is in co-current flow, which is bad.

of seal strips. I’m using the term sealing strips in a completely separate 
way than used in the preceding section of this chapter.
The seal strips, as used in association with the longitudinal cross-

There are two problems with these strips. First, they are subject to 
corrosion unless the proper material has been selected. Second, they 
must be replaced each time the bundle is pulled.
If these conditions are not met, then the shell-side liquid will 
partially bypass the majority of the tube surface area, and heat-transfer 
rates will suffer.
I have seen new exchangers of “two-pass shell” configurations 
work well when new. However, with time and typically after a turn-
around, performance has been degraded, due to leakage around the 
cross-flow (longitudinal) baffle.
My former employer, American Oil, prohibited their use because 
of this problem. I also adhere to this practice and thus will select 
placing two exchangers in series, which is the more expensive option, 
as opposed to relying on the two-pass shell alternate design.
For most applications, 316 s.s. is used for seal strips as flexibility 
and corrosion resistance are required. In noncorrosive services, copper 
alloy seal strips are used.
28.2.10  Selection of Fouling Factors
I see a lot of variation in the industry as to how designers specify 
exchanger fouling factors. As a conservative designer, I tend to use 
larger fouling factors than most. Much better to add in a safety factor 
this way than to assume larger than anticipated flows. If the flow is 
much less than the design, the velocities will also be too low.

A big fouling factor is typically 0.010 to 0.020 inch (hr) (ft2) (°F) ÷ 
Btu. For example, I might use 0.025 for extract from tar sands. A really 
nasty service. Or visbreaker fractionator bottoms. Or resid from a 
deep-cut vacuum tower.
For clean, light crude oil downstream of the desalter, I would use 
0.003. For heavy Venezuelan crude upstream of the desalter, I would 
use 0.007 to 0.010.
For jet or diesel, I would use 0.002 to 0.004. For heavy gas oil, 
about 0.005.
For light hydrocarbon reboilers, about 0.003 would be okay for 
virgin services and 0.005 for thermally degraded products that have 
not been exposed to air. If you have a thermally degraded naphtha 
that has been exposed to air, then 0.010–0.020 would be a reasonable 
fouling factor.
The steam side of exchangers is not subject to fouling. Yet I would 
still use 0.001, just to be conservative.
For air coolers, I would also use an air-side fouling factor of 0.001. 
What is far more important on an air cooler is the tube-side fouling 
factor.
The external finned area of an air cooler is typically 20 times 
larger than the tube internal area. Thus, if a tube-side fouling factor of 
0.002 is used, it must be multiplied by 20 to obtain the effective foul-
ing factor, based on the air cooler finned area.
If the overall heat-transfer coefficient for the air cooler is 10 Btu/hr/
ft2/°F, then the 0.002 tube-side fouling factor will represent 24 percent 
of the total heat-transfer resistance:
• Step One: 0.002 × 12 = 0.024 where 12 is the ratio of internal 
area to external finned area.
• Step Two: The reciprocal of the heat-transfer coefficient (10) 
is the sum of the individual heat-transfer resistance 5 (i.e., 
1/10 = 0.10).
• Step Three: 0.024 ÷ 0.10 = 24%.
For ordinary tubes, I never bother about the small effect of the 
ratio of outside area ÷ inside area. But for finned, studded, or 
serrated tubes (i.e., low fins), this ratio of area factor is really 
important, as it magnifies the effect on the tube-side fouling factor 
that is selected.
28.2.11  Selection of Allowable DP
This is a complex and difficult subject. The larger the specified design 
∆P, the more latitude the exchanger designer has to configure the 
exchanger for high velocities and a lower Reynolds number.
If we specify too low a ∆P, then we force the exchanger designer 
to specify low velocities.

	
374	
C h a p t e r  T w e n t y - E i g h t
If we specify too high a ∆P, then the designer may not choose to 
consume the available ∆P, which is then wasted across a control 
valve.
So, I guess my approach is best. Specify yourself:
• Size, length, and number of tubes
• Tube ID and pitch
• Number of tube passes
• Baffle spacing on shell side
• Baffle cut
Then, you will get the exchangers you really want every time.

ext to the efficiency of the trays in a distillation tower, the 
efficiency of a fired heater is the most critical factor in saving 
and/or making money for the process plant. The primary 
objectives in operation of a fired heater are to
• Keep the fire in the firebox
• Avoid excessive heat density in the firebox
• Maximize the process heat absorption for a given amount 
of fuel
These objectives are equally important in the operation of 
fired boilers whose principles of operation on the fire side and 
flue-gas side are essentially the same as those of process-plant-
fired heaters.
The two governing modes of heat transfer in the construction of a 
fired heater are radiation and convection.
In the firebox, heat transfer by radiation reigns supreme governed 
by Lambert’s laws, as follows:
	
QR = A ⋅ ε(T 4
fb - T 4
tm)	
where QR = radiant heat-transfer rate, Btu/h
	
A = surface area of the radiant tubes in the firebox, ft2
	
ε = emissivity factor
	
Tfb = absolute temperature, °Rankin, of the radiant surface, 
which is essentially the firebox temperature. The reason 
375

	
376	
C h a p t e r  T w e n t y - N i n e
for this is that the flames heat not so much the tubes as 
the refractory, and the refractory then reradiates the 
heat to the tubes, so the main heat source becomes the 
refractory
	
Ttm = the receiving metal absolute temperature, °Rankin (this 
is the radiant tube metal or tube skin temperature). 
(Rankin = °F + 460)
The amount of heat transferred to the process fluid in the convec-
tive section of a heater is governed by
	
Qc = A ⋅ U(Tfg - Tbulk)	
where Qc = convective heat-transfer rate, Btu/h
	
A = surface area of the tubes, ft2
	
U = a heat-transfer coefficient, Btu/[(h)(ft2)(°F)]
	
Tfg = temperature of the flue gas, °F
	
Tbulk = temperature of the process fluid flowing inside the tubes, °F
Note that the temperature driving force for radiant heat transfer  
(Tfb
4 - Ttm
4) is always a very large number as compared to the tem-
perature driving force for convective heat transfer (Tfg - Tbulk). For this 
reason, in nonfouling services we use finned tubes in the convective 
section of our fired heaters to increase the surface area of the tubes. 
The tubes in the firebox or radiant section are made of high-chrome 
steel capable of withstanding firebox temperatures of up to 2000°F 
depending on the severity of operation for which the heater has been 
designed. (Some very high-severity heaters may be designed for fire-
box temperatures of >2000°F.) Note especially that radiant section 
tubes are protected from overheating by the cooling effect of the pro-
cess fluid flowing inside them, where “flowing” is the key word. The 
bare, unfinned, shock tubes are also cooled by the process fluid flow 
(Fig. 29.1).
However, the convective-section finned tubes are not intended or 
designed to withstand such high temperatures, and so the tubes 
themselves are often made from low-temperature-rated carbon steel. 
The fins, which are not cooled by the process flow, are made from 
chrome steel. As it is much easier to make finned tubes from just one 
type of metal instead of two, though, the furnace manufacturers will 
often choose to make the finned convective-section tubes entirely out 
of low-chrome steel, in which case one could expect them to with-
stand temperatures of ≤1300°F. It is advisable to check what types of 
tubes you have in your furnace and know what temperature toler-
ances they have. The only thing that prevents the tubes in the convec-
tive section from overheating up to firebox temperatures is that we 
keep the fire in the firebox and do not allow the fire to get up into the 
convective section. This may sound obvious, but it is surprising how 
many people seem to forget or ignore this fact.

29.1  Effect of Reduced Air Flow
A typical natural-draft gas–fired process heater is shown in Fig. 29.1. 
Suppose we gradually close either the stack damper or the air regis-
ter; the flow of air into the firebox will then be reduced. If both the 
process-side flow and the fuel-gas rate are held constant, the following 
sequence of events occurs:
 
1. The heater process outlet temperature begins to increase as the 
excess air is reduced. This is because more heat is given to the 
process fluid and less heat goes up the stack.
 
2. The heater process outlet temperature declines as air flow is 
reduced past the point of absolute combustion as defined in the next 
section. In this situation we have products of incomplete or partial 
combustion such as aldehydes, ketones, and carbon monoxide 
going up the stack. This sets the heater up for afterburn in the 
stack, and the heating value of the fuel is also effectively reduced.

Allowing a fired heater, boiler, or furnace to operate with insuffi-
cient air is hazardous because
• The products of incomplete combustion are hot and will 
ignite as soon as they find sufficient oxygen. This usually 
results in afterburn in the convective section or stack and can 
even lead to explosive detonations.
• The products of partial combustion are atmospheric pollut-
ants.
• It is not possible to operate in automatic temperature control 
on the wrong side of the point of absolute combustion.
29.2  Absolute Combustion
Consider a forced-draft boiler producing 600-psig steam as shown in 
Fig. 29.2. The fuel rate on this boiler is fixed and we are going to 
optimize the oxygen (O2) content of the flue gas by adjusting the 
speed of the forced-draft (FD) fan. Do we simply adjust the FD fan 
to give 2 percent O2 in the stack because someone once said that 
2 percent O2 in the stack was a good number?
No! We are going to adjust the speed of the FD fan to produce the 
maximum amount of 600-psig steam. In other words, we are going to

maximize the heat to the process by adjusting the air rate. The point 
at which the steam production is at maximum is the point of absolute 
combustion. The oxygen content of the flue gas at the point of abso-
lute combustion, where steam production is maximum for a given 
amount of fuel, will be the optimum; it will not necessarily be at 
2 percent O2 or any other fixed oxygen content. The oxygen content of 
the flue gas at the point of absolute combustion is a variable, depend-
ing on air-fuel mixing efficiency.
The term absolute combustion is not the same as complete combus-
tion. Complete combustion is a theoretical term, implying a theoretical 
goal that we might aim toward but will never quite reach on any real 
process heater or boiler. The point of absolute combustion represents 
the best achievable efficiency point of any such piece of equipment on 
any day of the week, at any hour or minute.
One definition of the point of absolute combustion is the point of 
maximum heater outlet temperature for a given amount of fuel (as 
illustrated in Fig. 29.3). Following this, we can say that the point of 
absolute combustion is also the point of best or maximum achievable 
combustion for a given amount of fuel (as illustrated by Fig. 29.4). 
The point of absolute combustion in terms of either maximum heater 
outlet temperature or minimum fuel fired for a given outlet tempera-
ture would correspond to the same flue-gas oxygen content for a 
given furnace at the same moment in time. However, we must also 
note that this flue-gas oxygen content that corresponded to the point of 
absolute combustion on, say, heater 3304-A on Tuesday, January 2, 
2006, at midday is not likely to correspond to the point of absolute com-
bustion on the same heater on Wednesday, January 3, 2006, at midday,

or even Tuesday, January 2, 1996, one hour or one minute after it was 
first determined. Indeed, the oxygen content (percent O2), of the flue 
gas typically varies in the range of 0.5 percent O2 to as much as 
10 percent O2 depending on the design, mechanical integrity, and 
operating characteristics of the equipment, such as firing rate, burner 
type, and ambient weather conditions.
Did the oxygen analyzer really help us find the point of absolute 
combustion for the forced-draft boiler? No, it did not. However, once 
you have found the point of absolute combustion and then noted the 
corresponding flue-gas percent O2, as long as all operating conditions 
remain constant for the heater, then you could use the percent O2 in 
the flue gas as a rather secondary guideline for that period of time 
until the operating conditions changed.
29.2.1  Oxygen Starvation
If you try to operate a fired heater with too little combustion air you 
will starve the burners of oxygen to “smother” or “bog down” the fire-
box, then you will likely cause “afterburn” or secondary combustion 
in the stack. You will not be able to operate on automatic temperature 
control, and you may even destroy the equipment altogether.
This type of operation can also be described as operating on the 
wrong side of the point of absolute combustion. Take another look at 
Figs. 29.3 and 29.4; we are talking here about the portion of the curves 
marked as “bad operation.” What would be the color of the flue gas 
as it emerged from the stack during this type of operation? Would it 
be black?

381
No, it would not necessarily be black.
If we were burning heavy industrial fuel oil with a very high carbon: 
hydrogen ratio, then yes, very soon after we began to operate on the 
wrong side of the point of absolute combustion, the stack gases would 
turn black. After all, the black color is merely soot or unburned carbon. 
However, if we were burning pure hydrogen, the stack gases would 
never turn black no matter how much we starved the firebox of oxygen. 
If we were burning natural gas, then as we crossed over the wrong side 
of the point of absolute combustion, we might initially just be able to see 
the stack gases turn only a pale yellow. If we continued to decrease the 
combustion-air rate, the stack gas color might progress from pale yellow 
to dark yellow, to light orange, to dark orange, to brown, and finally to 
black. The color of the stack gases is not an accurate indication of whether 
we are using enough combustion air, as the point at which the stack gases 
finally turn black depends on the carbon:hydrogen ratio of the fuel. Also, 
while continuing to fall below the point of absolute combustion, we 
accelerate the production of atmospheric pollutants, such as aldehydes, 
ketones, light alcohols, carbon monoxide, and other products of the par-
tial combustion of light hydrocarbons in the stack gases.
If we have the furnace on automatic temperature control while 
we are not using enough combustion air, and if the control valve on 
the fuel gas then opens to allow more fuel to the burners in order to 
increase the furnace outlet temperature, the extra fuel will not burn 
efficiently. In fact, the extra fuel is likely to reduce the heater outlet 
temperature rather than increase it, as there is already a shortage of 
air and it cannot burn properly and tends to cool the firebox. The 
automatic temperature controller then senses the reduction in heater 
outlet temperature and increases the fuel rate. Thus the furnace will 
spiral into an increasingly dangerous condition as the outlet tem-
perature continues to fall and the furnace is left on automatic control. 
The way out of this situation is to put the furnace on manual control 
and manually reduce the fuel gas back to the point of absolute 
combustion.
To determine if you are running above the point of absolute com-
bustion (i.e., the safe area), observe the heater outlet temperature as 
you manually reduce the fuel-gas rate. If this temperature increases, 
then you are still on the wrong side of the point of absolute combus-
tion. If this temperature decreases, then you are on the safe side of the 
point of absolute combustion. Do not open the burner air registers 
until you are on this safe side. Increasing air flow when operating in 
a fuel-rich environment may make the firebox explode.
However, if we operate on manual without enough combustion 
air, we will share the experience explained by one oil refinery operator, 
as follows:
Our crude unit heater is very old; we have to operate it manually. We have three 
air blowers to produce the combustion air; we always run two with one on 

	
382	
C h a p t e r  T w e n t y - N i n e
standby. Once a week we switch the blowers by shutting one down and turning 
on the one that was idle.
  One week I was switching the blowers when I forgot to shut one of the two 
down before starting up the third blower. I then had all three blowers running 
at once. Our normal heater outlet temperature target is 680°F, but while I had all 
three blowers on, the outlet temperature rose rapidly to 740°F.
Rather than cutting the fuel gas back to reach a 680°F outlet tem-
perature increasing excess oxygen, he shut down the third blower 
and dropped the furnace temperature back to 680°F but also contin-
ued to run fuel-rich, without enough air. 
Which is cheaper, air or fuel? Of course, the answer is air. Are we 
trying to make the flue gas to some particular oxygen-content speci-
fication, or are we trying to save fuel? Certainly, the answer is that we 
want to get the most heat we can out of every pound of fuel. Well, 
then, dear reader, let us neither set nor encourage the use of these 
stack or flue-gas oxygen targets; they are meaningless and often cause 
more harm than good.
29.2.2  Appearance of the Firebox and Flames
Regardless of and in preference to oxygen analyzer results, we must 
consider the appearance of the firebox and flames when we assess 
whether more combustion air is needed:
If the firebox appears bright and clear, then there is more than 
enough oxygen (a crystal-clear firebox has a large excess of oxygen).
If the firebox appears hazy and the flames are long, licking, yellow, 
and smoky-looking, then there is not enough oxygen.
To be just right, the firebox should have a very slight haze and 
all the flames should be compact and not searching around the 
firebox looking for oxygen.
Do not stand directly in front of an inspection port while you open 
it, in case there is positive pressure behind it.
Flame color depends on fuel composition. Gas often burns blue, 
but heavy fuel oil burns yellow. A yellow flame is caused by thermal 
cracking of the fuel. There is nothing wrong with a yellow flame; it is 
the general shape of the flame that is important. Flames should be 
short and bright.
The temperature of the inside of a firebox can also be estimated 
by its visual appearance (Table 29.1).
29.2.3  Secondary Combustion or Afterburn
In the preceding paragraphs we discussed how operation without 
enough combustion air on the wrong side of the point of absolute 
combustion leads to inefficient combustion of fuel. Apart from the 
fuel wastage, there is another important disturbing and frequently 

	
F i r e d  H e a t e r s :  F i r e -  a n d  F l u e - G a s  S i d e 	
383
occurring problem associated with this bad mode of operation. The 
products of incomplete combustion of the fuel, and in more severe 
cases even the unburned fuel itself, flow with the flue gas up through 
the convective section and up the stack. A certain amount of air 
leaks in through the convective section and stack from outside the 
heater. When these hot, combustible hydrocarbons in the form of 
unburned fuel mix with the extra air that is leaking in from the envi-
ronment, re-ignition is liable to occur. We call this afterburn, or sec-
ondary ignition, meaning there is now fire in the convective section.
When combustible materials or unburned fuel re-ignite in the con-
vective section, a dramatic increase in flue-gas temperature will 
occur. The metallurgy of finned carbon steel convective-section tubes 
is not designed to withstand high temperatures. The fins will become 
oxidized and, when cool, may become brittle and thicker than before, 
thus restricting flue-gas flow. The convective-section tubes them-
selves will become warped and bent and thus restrict flue-gas flow 
still further.
Just such a thing happened as a result of another well-intentioned 
but misguided attempt to improve fuel firing efficiency by reducing 
the oxygen content of flue gas in a fired heater. This heater, which was 
also manually operated, had an oxygen analyzer probe installed in 
the convective section. The operators were given a target range to run 
between 2 and 6 percent O2 (note that this range would in many cases 
actually include the point of absolute combustion).
The inside operator (operator A), noting that the stack gases had 
8 percent O2, began to cut back on the combustion air. As operator A 
pinched back on the air register, the convective-section oxygen 
dropped slowly from 8 to 7.5 percent O2. The outside operator (oper-
ator B) went to check on the firebox and, seeing that it was full of

long, licking, yellow, smoky flames and had taken on a very hazy 
appearance, reported back to operator A that he considered the 
amount of air in the firebox was insufficient.
Meanwhile operator A looked again at his O2 analyzer output, 
which showed 7.5 percent O2. He told operator B that there was 
plenty of oxygen because the analyzer showed 7.5 percent O2, so he 
must be mistaken and, in fact, that he needed to go and pinch back 
still further on the air register to cut back the combustion air.
After cutting back on the air registers, operator A noticed that the 
heater outlet temperature dropped, so he raised the fuel rate to main-
tain the heater outlet temperature. He did not realize that this sequence 
of events was an indication of insufficient combustion air, because the 
convective-section oxygen analyzer still showed 7 percent O2, so he 
asked operator B to pinch back still further on the air registers.
At this point, black smoke started coming out of the stack, and 
several of operator B’s colleagues began to suggest that they should 
start to open up the air registers and increase the combustion air 
and not reduce it any further. However, operator A, now reading 
6.5 percent O2 in the convective section on his O2 analyzer, was 
determined to reach his 6 percent O2, and requested a further cut-
back on the combustion air.
When the combustion air was cut back this time, fire started to 
come out of the stack. Now operator A was forced to admit that they 
would have to increase the combustion air again. The problem they 
then faced was that the amount of draft in the heater seemed to be 
less than before and they were not quite able to re-establish the same 
air flow. The reason for the restricted air flow was that they had 
caused afterburn in the convective section and damaged the convec-
tive-section tubes, which now restricted the flow of flue gas and 
hence the flow of combustion air to the burners.
29.2.4  Using the Concept of Absolute Combustion 
in Operations
The only correct oxygen target is that firebox oxygen content that max-
imizes the process-side heat absorption for a given amount of fuel, or 
if you prefer, we could say it is that the firebox oxygen target that 
minimizes fuel consumption for a given process-side heat absorption.
This correct percent O2 in the firebox can be determined only by 
experimenting with the fired heater, furnace, or boiler in the field. 
This firebox O2 will also vary for any given piece of fired equipment 
depending on a variety of factors, including mechanical integrity and 
firing rate. In reality, it is not the firebox oxygen content that we are 
looking for so much as the correct combustion-air rate for proper 
operation. The search for the correct combustion-air rate on any 
particular day is known as heat-proving the heater. Experienced operators 
will increase and decrease the combustion air to find that particular rate 

	
F i r e d  H e a t e r s :  F i r e -  a n d  F l u e - G a s  S i d e 	
385
that minimizes the fuel rate. Naturally, experienced operators have 
been heat-proving heaters since long before oxygen analyzers were 
invented. In view of this, it seems that we do not actually need an 
oxygen analyzer to run a piece of fired equipment efficiently.
The concept is not to run the fired equipment to a specific oxygen 
target because the oxygen content corresponding to the most efficient 
operation varies, but to aim instead to maximize heat absorption to the 
process stream for a given fuel rate. Once we have heat-proved the 
heater and found this point of maximum heat absorption, which we call 
the point of absolute combustion, we will then need to operate the furnace 
with somewhat more air. We call this operating on the “good” side of 
the point of absolute combustion, as shown in Figs. 29.3 and 29.4.
If we do not ensure that we operate some extra air to put us on the 
good side of the point of absolute combustion, then we run the risk of 
getting into oxygen starvation on the wrong side or “bad” side of the 
point of absolute combustion.
Automatic operation linked to process outlet temperature while 
on the bad side of absolute combustion is potentially hazardous 
because the heater outlet temperature will drop as a result of the 
reduced heating efficiency of the fuel. The automatic control will then 
call for more fuel, which, in turn, produces more oxygen starvation. 
The only way out of this situation is to put the furnace back to manual 
operation and manually reduce the fuel to get back to the good side of 
the point of absolute combustion.
Note that combustion air is inexpensive compared to fuel; it is 
irrational to cut back on combustion air and waste fuel by inefficient 
burning. Also note that to operate fired equipment efficiently, we 
need to heat-prove it or test to find the point of absolute combustion 
on a regular basis.
29.2.5  Flue-Gas Oxygen and Tramp Air
Suppose we have a natural-draft heater operating very efficiently on 
the good side of the point of absolute combustion. The oxygen con-
tent of the firebox gases (just below the shock tubes) is 2.5 percent 
oxygen as shown in Fig. 29.5. What do you think the oxygen content 
of the flue gases in the stack will be?
The answer is it will always be more than the firebox oxygen con-
tent, because there are always air leaks in the convective section and 
stack that, with the slightest negative pressure in the stack or convec-
tive section, will allow air to leak in. These air leaks are collectively 
known as “tramp air.”
The amount of tramp air will vary according to
•	 The mechanical integrity of the heater, i.e., the number of 
holes in the casing
•	 The firing rate and draft balance of the heater

	
386	
C h a p t e r  T w e n t y - N i n e
The oxygen measured in the stack is the sum of the unused oxy-
gen from the firebox plus the oxygen from tramp air drawn into the 
convective section and stack.
We have already shown that it is wrong to operate a furnace to an 
arbitrary oxygen target. It is entirely incorrect to adjust the furnace 
combustion air based on stack gas and/or convective-section flue-gas 
oxygen readings, because—as a result of the inevitable air in-leak-
age—the stack gas and/or convective-section flue-gas oxygen content 
does not necessarily represent the amount of oxygen in the firebox. It 
is also impossible to offset the stack or convective-section oxygen 
readings to represent the firebox oxygen content because the amount 
of air in-leakage varies so much with time as conditions change.
Unfortunately, many heaters have oxygen sensors in the stack and 
not in the firebox. An oxygen sensor in the firebox may provide a use-
ful guide, as we mentioned earlier, although it is not actually needed 
to run the heater efficiently. However, an oxygen analyzer in the stack 
or convective section is really useful only in operations if there is also 
an oxygen analyzer in the firebox; in such instances it could be used 
to trend air leaks across the convective section. Never ever use an on-
line analyzer for technical analysis or test work. Oxygen-content field 
measurements should always be taken with a single portable oxygen

analyzer. Be careful to calibrate the portable instrument for the range 
in which we want to use it. Cylinders of test gases with specific oxy-
gen contents are available for calibration purposes.
If the combustion of air flow is being adjusted on the basis of the 
oxygen content of the stack or convective section gases (i.e., from 
readings taken on an oxygen analyzer with a probe located in the 
stack or convective section), there may be afterburn or secondary 
ignition in the convective section. The fire is supposed to be contained 
within the firebox, and not in the convective section. If we intend to 
install an oxygen analyzer, the analyzer should be monitoring oxygen 
in the firebox itself. Lone oxygen analyzers monitoring oxygen in the 
convective section are misleading as a result of the tramp air, and are 
a positive hazard to safe operation.
29.3  Draft
29.3.1  Draft Readings
Draft readings are a comparison of two pressures taken at the same eleva-
tion and are traditionally quoted in inches of water. To make sense of a set 
of draft readings for a furnace, you must first normalize the data.
In Fig. 29.6, we see a simple natural-draft heater with no 
convective-section tubes. The laws of hydraulics tell us that fluids 
flow from regions of high pressure to regions of lower pressure, and 
yet the draft readings in Fig. 29.6 seem to contradict this principle.
Notice that the draft readings are made at different elevations. Each 
measurement is in reality a comparison between the densities of the gas 
both inside and outside the furnace at a given elevation. The tempera-
ture difference is the main reason for difference in density inside and 
outside the furnace. The molecular weights of the furnace gases and of 
air are approximately the same.
To make sense of the draft measurements so that we can use them 
to evaluate furnace pressure drop, proceed as follows:
 
1. Make a datum line across the top of the stack as shown in 
Fig. 29.6.
	
2.	 For each draft reading, add on the pressure exerted by the 
appropriate static head of air.
Given: 150 ft of air = 2.22 inch H2O (or inches of water gauge), in our 
example, which is for 60°F ambient air at sea level. Figure 29.6 illustrates 
the principle.
The standard instrument which is used to take draft readings is 
the magnehelic delta-pressure (P) gauge. However, if you wish to 
carry out a draft survey, it is possible to make some fairly good read-
ings with nothing more complicated than a clear glass bottle, some 
water, and a length of clear plastic tubing. Fill the bottle with water, 

	
388	
C h a p t e r  T w e n t y - N i n e
insert the plastic tube in the bottle. Attach the other open end of the 
plastic tube at the point where you wish to take the draft reading. The 
difference in the vertical height between the level of water in the bottle 
and the level of water drawn up in the tube will be your draft reading 
in inches of water gauge, as shown in Fig. 29.7.
29.3.1.1  Draft Induced by Wind
Running with a positive pressure below the bottom row of convective 
tubes is potentially dangerous, especially if there is an appreciable 
quantity of sulfur in the fuel. The sulfur dioxide would then blow out 
of the sight ports and leak in the convective section. SO2 is a toxic gas.
In some texts, it is advised to maintain a minimum safe draft of 
0.05 inch H2O. However, there is a problem with this target. The prob-
lem is wind. Wind can create a variable draft of plus or minus 0.10 inch 
H2O or more. If the draft decreases, as the gusts of wind come and go, 
then the heater may go positive and a personnel hazard is created. 
Thus, the minimum safe draft depends upon the variability of the 
wind. Not at grade, but the wind speed at the top of the stack.
When draft decreases, due to a reduction in wind, air flow into the 
burners also decreases. If this causes the firebox to drop below the point

of absolute combustion, then the heater will bog down and become 
flooded with fuel. That is, the heater will be caught in a positive feed-
back loop, on the wrong side of the point of absolute combustion.
29.3.1.2  Draft Induced by Density Difference
Draft is mainly due to the density difference between the hot flue gas 
and the ambient air. Draft is also a function of the height of the stack. 
For example:
• Density of cold air = 0.070 lb/ft3
• Density of hot flue gas = 0.030 lb/ft3
• Density difference = 0.040 lb/ft3
• Stack height = 100 feet
The calculated draft is then:
•	 0.040 lb/ft3 × 100 ft = 4.0 lb/ft2

water

approximate draft measurements.

C h a p t e r  T w e n t y - N i n e
To convert to inches of H2O:
•	 4.0 lb/ft2 ÷ 144 (inch)2/ft2 × 28 inch H2O/PSI
Therefore, Draft = 0.80 inch H2O.
The wind also creates 0.1 to 0.2 inches of water draft. Frictional 
losses in the stack tend to reduce draft. I usually ignore both factors, 
even though on occasion they may very well be significant.
29.3.1.3  Draft Induced by Reduction in Stack Diameter
We were driving through some very rural and remote areas of India 
last year. The major crop was sugarcane. Every few miles there was 
a primitive process plant to produce raw sugar from the cane. The 
cane was crushed by electric motor–driven rollers to recover the 
sweet juice. The juice was then boiled down and partially 
evaporated, using the crushed cane as fuel. I noted that the top of 
the boiler chimney was about one-third of the diameter at the base 
of the chimney. The reason for this large reduction in chimney 
diameter is to help induce a draft by increasing velocity of the flue 
gas in the upper portions of the chimney. Neglecting frictional 
losses, the draft induced by increasing velocity due to the reduc-
tion in chimney cross-sectional area is (see Section 16.4.2 on “Nozzle 
Exit Loss Calculation” in Chap. 16 for details):
•	 Draft = [(Density)/62.3] ¥ (0.186) ¥ (V2
2 - V1
2)
where:
•	 Density = Density of the flue gas in lb/ft3
•	 62.3 = The density of water, lb/ft3
•	 0.186 = The conversion factor used to convert kinetic energy 
into potential energy
•	 V1 = Velocity, ft/s, in fat part of chimney
•	 V2 = Velocity, ft/s, in thin part of chimney
(Note—The 0.186 coefficient is based on the gravitational 
constant, 32.2 ft/s2.)
If the diameter of the chimney is reduced by two-thirds, then the 
chimney cross-sectional area is reduced by 90 percent. Hence, if the 
velocity at the bottom of the chimney (V1) is 10 ft/s, then the velocity 
at the top of the chimney (V2) is 100 ft/s.
Therefore, the draft due to the reduction in chimney diameter is:
•	 (0.035)/62.3) ¥ (0.186) ¥ (10,000 - 100) = 1.05 inches of water 
draft
The 0.035 is the density of the flue gas at 600°F, assuming its 
molecular weight is the same as air.

391
Caution: Based on the roughness inside the stack, some or all of 
this draft may be lost due to friction.
We asked the local guys running the boiler why they thought the 
top portion of their stack was so narrow. They simply answered, 
“This is the way it’s always done, it is our tradition handed down for 
generations. This is India, and here we have learned that it’s best to 
follow our traditions.”
29.3.2  Draft Balancing
The air register and the stack damper are used together as a team to 
optimize the heater draft. Our aim in balancing the draft for a natural-
draft or a balanced-draft heater is to maintain a small negative pres-
sure of -0.1 inch of water, just below the shock tubes (refer to Fig. 29.5), 
at the entrance to the convective section. At the same time we must 
maintain enough air to operate on the good side of the point of abso-
lute combustion.
If we operate with a positive pressure in the firebox, although 
the burners may appear to operate normally, the hot flue gases will 
leak outward. This damages the roof arch supports and the steel 
structure so as to shorten the life of the heater. Flame impingement 
of the upper radiant tubes may also result from positive pressures.
As we close the stack damper, the pressure at the convective-
section inlet will increase; that is, we will have less draft. This will 
reduce the rate of flue gas to the convective section, minimizing the 
rate of air in-leakage to the convective section and the chances of 
afterburn occurring. However, if we close the stack damper too much, 
a positive pressure will develop at the convective-section inlet, which 
we must avoid.
Conversely, as we open the stack damper, the pressure at the 
convective-section inlet will decrease, so that we have more draft. If 
we have too much draft, we will increase the risk of afterburn as we are 
increasing the rate of air in-leakage in the convective section and stack.
We adjust the draft with the stack damper and maintain the 
combustion-air level by adjusting the air registers to accommodate 
the adjustments made on the stack damper.
29.4  Air Leakage
29.4.1  Evaluating Fuel Wastage Due to Air Leaks
Convective-section air leaks reduce the thermal efficiency of the 
heater by mixing cold ambient air with hot flue gas. The resulting

and the firebox has 6 percent O2 measured just below the shock tubes.

29.4.2  Minimizing Fuel Wastage Due to Air Leaks
Suppose we now cut back on the combustion air by closing the air 
registers a little. The oxygen content in the firebox is now 3 percent. 
The oxygen in the convective section will also be reduced to, say, 
9 percent oxygen. Notice how the difference between the firebox 
oxygen and convective-section oxygen (which we refer to as O2) 
has increased. It is now 6 percent O2. This is because the draft 
through the heater has increased (i.e., the pressure is more negative), 
and more air is being sucked in through the holes or air leaks in the 
convective section. If we still had a stack temperature of 600°F with 
ambient air at 100°F, we would now be wasting 6 percent of the fuel 
fired. This is not a pleasing result, as we can see extra fuel will have 
to be burned in the firebox to offset the increased air in-leakage.
Suppose we put the air registers back as they were and pinch on 
the stack damper instead. So let’s suppose we restrict air flow via the 
stack damper until the firebox oxygen goes down from our base case 
value of 6 to 3 percent. The oxygen in the convective section will also 
be reduced to, say, 5 percent. In this case, we see that the O2 is also 
much less, only 2 percent. This is because we now have less draft 
through the heater, that is, the pressure in the convective section 
increased and so has reduced the air in-leakage rate. This also illus-
trates how the air leaks themselves vary in accordance with the com-
bined operation of a stack damper and air register.
29.4.3  Patching Air Leaks
To suppress afterburn and minimize energy losses caused by in-leak-
age of cold ambient air, any holes in the heater walls, convective sec-
tion, ducts, and so on, should be patched. Also make sure that inspec-
tion ports are closed. Leaks can be detected on stream to a certain

393
extent by visual inspection (crumbling chalk dust or dropping a little 
baking powder past a suspected leak will pinpoint the leak).
During a turnaround, a smoke test should be carried out as follows:
	
1.	 Close the stack damper.
	
2.	 Ignite colored smoke bombs or even old tires in the firebox.
 
3. Turn on the forced-draft fan, if there is one, to assist the smoke.
	
4.	 Watch to see where the colored smoke emerges as these 
points are the sources of the air leaks.
Patch the leaks using heavy-duty aluminum tape, insulating 
mud, or silicone sealers, and weld up any loose sheet metal.
29.5  Efficient Air/Fuel Mixing
The function of a burner is to mix oxygen, in the form of air, with the 
fuel so that the fuel will burn more efficiently. Burners are available in 
a variety of different designs, all engineered with the intent to maxi-
mize air/fuel mixing efficiency. In more recent times we have the 
added concern of also minimizing the formation of atmospheric pol-
lutants. Fuel will burn at the end of a pipe with no burner at all, but 
the combustion will be far from efficient.
Some burners are fitted with primary- and secondary-air registers, 
as is the premix burner shown in Fig. 29.8. Air entering through the

primary-air register mixes much more efficiently than does the air that 
enters through the secondary-air registers. Thus we should maximize 
the use of primary air, and we do this by gradually opening up the 
primary-air register until the flame just begins to lift away from the 
burner tip. The remaining combustion air should be provided through 
the secondary-air register.
29.6  Optimizing Excess Air
The term optimizing excess air, as we have seen, does not refer to opera-
tion at some arbitrary oxygen level; instead, consider the following in 
relation to your heater, and you will be optimizing excess air:
•	 Minimize fuel rate for a given heater outlet temperature (or 
steam production in a boiler), then operate at 0.5 to 1 percent 
higher oxygen.
•	 Maximize primary air to burners, where burners have pri-
mary and secondary air.
•	 Adjust draft to minimize air in-leakage while maintaining a 
small negative pressure at the entrance to the convective section.
•	 Close openings to pilot lights, sight-ports, and other holes 
around burners. (Combustion air only mixes properly 
through the burner air register.)
•	 When operating at reduced firing rates, shut down some 
burners if possible, as burners work more efficiently when 
operating close to their design capacity (also remember to 
close air registers on idle burners).
•	 Minimize poor lateral air distribution in the firebox by adjust-
ing air registers on individual burners. Having a low air flow 
in one part of the heater will lead to higher overall oxygen 
requirements.
•	 Keep burners clean. Plugged burner tips increase oxygen 
requirements; maintain a regular burner cleaning program.
•	 Pay attention to the visual appearance of the firebox.
29.7  Air Preheating, Lighting Burners, and Heat 
Balancing
29.7.1  Air Preheaters
A typical air preheater will reduce the fuel required to liberate a given 
amount of heat by 10 percent. The debit for this improved thermal effi-
ciency is a higher flame temperature and the possibility of overheating 
the radiant section. There is a clear advantage to fit an air preheater 

	
F i r e d  H e a t e r s :  F i r e -  a n d  F l u e - G a s  S i d e 	
395
to a furnace when the firebox is running below a maximum firebox 
temperature. Three types of air preheaters are in common use:
•	 Direct heat exchange between flue gas and air
•	 Heat exchange via intermediate circulating oil
•	 Heat exchange via massive heat-transfer wheel, packed with 
metal baskets (Lungstrom type)
The wheel type is subject to air leaks across the mechanical seals. 
This leakage is identified by increased oxygen content in the flue gas, 
low flue-gas outlet temperature, and a greater temperature loss in the 
flue than rise in the air temperature across the preheater, as shown in 
Fig. 29.9.
In general, air preheater leaks are a problem because they
• Reduce the thermal efficiency of the air preheaters.
• May reduce combustion air so that it falls below that required 
for absolute combustion, resulting in destructive afterburn. 
(Note: Air preheaters themselves are often destroyed by 
afterburn.)
• May cause the forced-draft fan to operate at higher flows, 
requiring higher driver horsepower.
All air preheaters are subject to corrosive attack caused by con-
densation of sulfur trioxide. At a 150-ppm sulfur in the fuel gas, oper-
ating experience shows that a minimum temperature of 350 to 400°F 
minimizes corrosive attack. Uneven cooling in the preheater results 
in the need to keep the flue-gas outlet temperature 50 to 100°F above 
the calculated SO3 dew point. The flue-gas outlet temperature can be

increased by use of an air preheater air-side bypass, or by increasing 
the excess air in the firebox (this second method is discussed further 
in Sec. 29.7.4).
29.7.2  Heater Thumping or Vibration
29.7.2.1  Preheater Vibration
Air preheaters or any type of waste-heat recovery device designed 
for horizontal flow across vertical tubes may be subject to vibration 
produced by the velocity of gas across the tube banks. The velocity 
produces a vortex-shedding wave pattern that could correspond to 
the natural harmonic frequency of the tube bank. If the natural har-
monic frequency is reached, excessive vibration of the tubes will 
occur. Redesign of the internal baffle system by inserting dummy 
baffles can stop the vibration.
29.7.2.2  Vibrations in Fired Equipment and Afterburn
Balanced-draft or induced-draft furnaces and boilers are intended to 
be operated with a small negative pressure (ca. -0.1 inch H2O) just 
below the first row of convective tubes, that is, just below the shock 
tubes. If we operate such a piece of equipment with a severe shortage 
of air in the firebox and massive air in-leakage in the convective sec-
tion, it may sometimes experience thumping, puffing, or vibration.
Take a look at my sketch of a “puffing” boiler, Fig. 29.10. It is 
operating with perhaps a little too much draft, but look at the firebox 
oxygen; it is only 0.6 percent. However, the oxygen content of the flue 
gas steadily increases to 3.1 percent at the outlet from the convective 
section. This boiler has a tremendous amount of air leaking into the 
convective section. Perhaps someone is operating it on the basis of 
that 3.1 percent oxygen to the stack, without checking the firebox con-
ditions—very foolish, as I hope you will now agree. This boiler is 
puffing, too; perhaps I should have shown its convective-section 
walls alternatively convex and concave, but instead I have just enti-
tled it “the puffing boiler.” Here is what actually causes the puffing, 
vibrating, or thumping.
The fuel gas is not properly combusted at the burners, so par-
tially combusted hydrocarbons and perhaps some totally unburned 
fuel pass up into the convective section with the flue gas. The con-
vective section, as shown in Fig. 29.10, is under negative pressure, so 
air leaks in and mixes with the hot unburned hydrocarbons, which 
then re-ignite; thus we have afterburn in the convective section. The 
heat of the fire in the convective section expands in the flue gases, 
causing a positive pressure in the convective section, which stops the 
air leaks. After some period of time, the fire in the convective section 
has consumed all the tramp air and is extinguished. The convective-
section flue gases then cool and shrink, re-establishing a negative 
pressure as before, and, as before, air leaks into the convective section

and the hot, unburned hydrocarbons from the firebox mix with that 
tramp air and re-ignite in the convective section.
This cycle of events will continue, except each time the ambient 
hydrocarbons ignite in the convective section and the pressure 
changes from negative to positive the leaks will increase in size as the 
boiler fabric is shaken.
If the air flow to the firebox becomes very severely low, then one 
or more of the burners may be extinguished through lack of oxygen. 
If the fuel is then left to flow unchecked, it will build up in the firebox

until eventually enough tramp air has been sucked into the firebox, at 
which point the extinguished burners may be re-ignited by the heat 
left in the refractory walls, causing a minor explosion or a detonation 
as it ignites. The magnitude of the explosion depends on the degree 
of oxygen starvation.
If anything like this is happening to your fired equipment, open up 
the air registers, get more air into the firebox, and patch the leaks!
29.7.3  Lighting Burners
Before lighting burners in a piece of fired equipment that has been 
idle or offline for any time or whose burners have become extin-
guished during operation, it is vital to first purge the firebox of hydro-
carbons and combustibles or explosive mixtures. Here is a method as 
outlined to me by a prominent burner manufacturing company:
	 1a. If the furnace or boiler has a forced-draft fan, open the damp-
ers and displace 5 volumes of air.
	 1b. If the furnace or boiler is natural-draft, open the air register 
and stack damper and wait for 5 to 10 minutes.
	
2.	 Check the firebox with a hydrocarbon detector (the plant’s 
fire station will usually have one of these and someone 
trained in its use). Pay particular attention to stagnant areas 
of the firebox, as fuel-gas valves tend to leak through burners 
and gases build up in areas of low air flow. Look for unburned 
gas and explosive mixtures. If you detect any such fuel or 
explosive mixtures, repeat step 1a or 1b, then test again with 
the hydrocarbon detector. Continue this process until the fire-
box is purged of all combustible or explosive material.
	
3.	 Light the pilot lights.
 
4. Light the burners using pilot lights.
Please note that it is not only bad practice but extremely danger-
ous to light main burners without the use of a properly installed pilot 
light. Butane torches, “fireworks,” torches consisting of gasoline-
soaked rags on sticks, or residual heat in the furnace refractory do not 
provide a safe alternative to a properly installed pilot light. Please 
also note that fired equipment either without burner pilot lights or 
with extinguished burner pilot lights have been known to explode 
during operation, as the pilots, when lit, do provide some means of 
safely relighting or keeping main burners alight. 
An explosive mixture in the firebox is indicated for methane (i.e., 
natural gas) when the methane content is between 5% and 15%. When 
the firebox methane content is below 5%, the air-fuel mixture is too 
lean to combust. When the methane content is above 15%, the mix-
ture is too rich to combust. The comparable values for hydrogen are 

	
F i r e d  H e a t e r s :  F i r e -  a n d  F l u e - G a s  S i d e 	
399
4% (too lean) and 75% (too rich). This suggests that refinery fuel gas, 
which may contain 5 to 50% hydrogen, can explode much more read-
ily than natural gas. The presence of H2 in fuel gas is a strong argu-
ment, then, for connecting pilot lights to natural gas, which is very 
low in H2. 
We have had several sad experiences of losing co-workers due to 
firebox explosions. Always, the deaths could have been avoided if the 
pilots had been lighted first.
For example, a survivor will say, “We tried to light the pilot lights 
first, but they wouldn’t light-off. It isn’t our fault that HDS heater 
blew itself up.”
“Okay. It’s not your fault. Some idiot connected the pilots to dirty 
fuel gas, rather than natural gas. But why didn’t you clean out the 
little spud inside the pilot light? It only needs a crescent wrench to do 
the job in two minutes.”
“That isn’t our job,” the operators replied.
“Okay. But if you can’t get the pilot lit, then don’t open the gas to 
the main burner.”
“Well, how are we going to start up the HDS without H-3?”
“It’s simple, guys. If you can’t run a unit safely, then don’t run the 
unit.” 
This was a pretty accurate rendition of a discussion with two 
operators at the Tenneco Oil Refinery in Chalmette, Louisiana, in 
1984. 
Today, burner manufacturers have access to all kinds of designs for 
pilot lights, to fit all shapes and sizes of burners and burner ports and 
draft systems from the smallest breeze to gale-force winds. There is no 
longer any excuse to operate without pilot lights installed and working.

In the United States, oil firing is uncommon. In Europe, it’s pretty 
standard. Most oil-fired burners use atomizing steam to produce a 
large surface area of the oil exposed to the combustion air.1 In the 
steam atomizer shown in Fig. 29.11, jets of oil under pressure meet 
the spinning jets of steam under pressure in the mixing chamber. A 
mist of oil and steam is discharged into the furnace. The pressure 
drop of the oil through both the oil orifices of the tangential slots is 
typically 10 to 30 psi (0.5 to 2.0 BAR). In general, an oil-fired burner 
uses a higher percent of excess air, as it’s more difficult to mix air with 
liquid fuel than with gaseous fuel.
The fuel oil flows from a circulating hot oil system kept at several 
hundred °F, depending on what is being burned. In most refineries, 
visbreaker or vacuum tower bottoms provide the fuel oil, which is 
circulated at about 500°F. Burner tip plugging of the oil orifices shown 
in Fig. 29.11 is a routine problem.
The most serious problem is loss of fuel oil circulation in case of an 
electrical power failure. The fuel oil can then solidify in the circulating

system and in the burners themselves. For example, vacuum tower 
visbreaker bottoms can solidify at 300°F.
29.7.4  Heat Balancing
Let us finally look at a situation where one might wish to transfer 
heat duty from the firebox to the radiant section. At the beginning of 
the discussion on air preheaters earlier in this chapter, we noted how 
fitting an air preheater to an existing furnace would increase the 
flame temperature and possibly overheat the firebox.
Suppose a fired heater in an oil refinery, in service to heat crude 
oil, is fitted with a new air preheater. The firebox was running hot 
before the air preheater was installed, but the management was con-
vinced that the installation of the air preheater would allow them to 
heat more crude oil. When the heater with its new air preheater came 
back online, the following changes were noted:
• Fuel-gas consumption was down by 10 percent (for the same 
heat absorbed as before the revamp).
• The firebox, which was hot before the revamp, was now hot-
ter, even at the original crude-oil flow rate; thus, rather than 
running more crude, operations personnel had to cut back 
the crude rate to maintain satisfactory firebox conditions.
• Crude-oil side convection outlet temperatures were lower.
Here is what happened. Preheating the air by 300°F had raised 
the burner flame temperature by 300°F. The hotter flames then radi-
ated more heat per pound of fuel consumed, and as a result, the 
firebox became much hotter. The same factor that reduces fuel con-
sumption in the radiant section also reduced the flow of flue gas to

the convective section, thus reducing the convective-section outlet 
temperature.
So what can we do to actually run more crude, especially as there 
is no bypass around this new air preheater?
The answer, of course, is to allow more air into the firebox and 
thus generate more flue gas. The firebox oxygen was increased from 
3 to 6 percent, which reduced the firebox temperature to its prere-
vamp state. This, in turn, increased the pounds of flue gas flowing 
through the convective section and increased the heat absorbed in the 
convective section.
The increased combustion air flow was needed not for combus-
tion, but to transfer heat from the radiant section (firebox) to the con-
vective section. This is what we call heat balancing. In this situation, 
oxygen requirements to reach absolute combustion become irrelevant 
as we are now operating with a very plentiful supply of oxygen.
29.7.5  Lack of Air Affects Draft and Combustion
Normally, opening the air registers at the base of a heater reduces 
draft (i.e., increases pressure) below the bottom row of convective 
tubes. This happens because the extra combustion air creates more 
flue gas, which results in an increased ∆P across the convective-
section tubes and the stack damper.
However, if the heater is operating in an oxygen-deficient envi-
ronment, or it is running below the point of absolute combustion, 
draft will likely increase as the air registers are opened. We saw this 
happen recently. When the air supply to the burners was increased, 
the flame appearance changed from dull orange to a bright bluish-
yellow. The firebox became noticeably hotter. We assumed (but failed 
to check) that the stack also became hotter. A hotter stack reduces the 
density of the flue gas, and that will always increase draft. The air 
flow was normally restricted to meet an arbitrary—and apparently 
excessively low—O2 target in the stack.
The conclusion, then, is that if opening air registers increased 
draft, the heater had been operating below the point of absolute com-
bustion.

T
he heat of combustion in a process heater may liberate 100 × 
106 Btu/h. If the heater’s efficiency is 78 percent, the heat 
absorbed by the tubes should be 78 × 106 Btu/h. When observ-
ing a heater’s operation, it is a good idea to check this heat balance 
by calculation.
30.1  Process Duty versus Heat Liberation
The heat of combustion is a product of the amount of fuel consumed 
and the net heating value of the fuel. The heater’s efficiency is a func-
tion of the flue-gas stack temperature, the excess air or oxygen, and 
the ambient-heat losses from the firebox and the convective-section 
structures.
The heat absorbed by the tubes is the sum of the heat of vapo-
rization of the process liquid to vapor, plus the increase in the sensible-
heat content of the flowing process fluid.
If the heat picked up from the combustion of the fuel does not 
equal the heat absorbed by the process fluid, then something is 
amiss with the data. Often, determining the cause of such an incon-
sistency will reveal several fundamental operating or measurement 
problems with a fired heater. Quite commonly, we may find that the 
metered fuel-gas rate is wrong, or that the ambient-heat losses are 
much greater than anticipated in our calculations.

30.1.1  Distribution of Heat of Combustion
When fuel is burned in a fired heater, there are three major products 
of combustion:
• Water
• Carbon dioxide
• Heat or British thermal units (BTUs)
The water plus the CO2 mix with the inert nitrogen in the com-
bustion air to form flue gas. There is also some oxygen in this flue 
gas. This oxygen is called excess O2. A typical excess O2 content of flue 
gas is 2 to 6 percent. About 80 percent of the flue gas is N2. The rest is 
H2O plus CO2.
The heat liberated by combustion is distributed in one of three 
ways:
• Some of the heat is used to increase the temperature of the 
combustion air from the ambient-air temperature to the tem-
perature of the flue gas leaving the heater’s firebox. This heat 
is called the convective-heat content of the flue gas.
• Some of the heat is radiated directly to the heater tubes.
• The rest of the heat is radiated to the refractory walls.
In most heaters, the majority of the heat of combustion is radiated 
to the refractory walls. The glowing refractory walls then reradiate 
the heat to the heater tubes.
Many older heaters have massive brick refractory walls. The 
weight of these walls greatly exceeds the weight of the heater’s tubes. 
The massive brick refractory walls store a great deal of heat. This 
creates several operating problems. One such problem is that it takes 
many hours to bring such a heater up to its normal operating tem-
perature. However, a far more serious problem occurs when the 
process flow to a heater is interrupted.
Newer heaters typically have thin reflective tiles, rather than mas-
sive refractory brick walls. Such newer heaters will heat up more rapidly. 
Also, the process fluid outlet temperature responds more rapidly to 
changes in the firing rate. This improves the heater outlet temperature 
control. Perhaps for this reason, it seems that heaters with reflective 
refractory walls are less subject to process tube coking and shortened 
heater run lengths. There is also a process, called “alonizing,” that 
increases the reflectivity of older brick refractory heater walls.
30.1.2  Reradiation of Heat from Refractory
When flow is first lost, the fuel to the heater is often automatically 
tripped off. But the refractory walls continue to radiate heat to the 
process tubes. It is rather like a large flywheel. Even after we stop 

	
F i r e d  H e a t e r s :  P r o c e s s  S i d e 	
405
cranking the wheel, the rotational energy stored by the wheel keeps it 
spinning. Even when all the firing is stopped, the energy stored in the 
refractory walls continues to radiate heat to the process tubes.
But without flow, there is no way to carry the heat away from the 
tubes. Therefore, the tubes overheat. The temperature of the tubes 
may approach the temperature of the refractory, at the point in 
time when flow is lost. The refractory temperature is indicated by 
the firebox temperature or the temperature of the flue gas flowing 
from the firebox into the convective section.
A typical firebox temperature is 1500°F. Thus, the heater tubes 
can reach 1300°F on loss of the process flow, even though the fuel 
flow has been immediately stopped. Tubes with a low chrome con-
tent may bend and distort as a result of such overheating. Even at 
1000°F, residual liquid left in the tubes when flow is lost may ther-
mally degrade to a carbonaceous solid or heavy polymer that fouls 
the interior of the tubes.
One way to combat this problem is with steam. As soon as the 
flow is interrupted, high-pressure purge steam is automatically 
opened into the heater tube inlets. The steam blows the residual liq-
uid out of the tubes and also helps remove heat from the tubes.
30.1.2.1  Stuttering-Feed Interruption
After the purge steam begins to flow, the refractory walls and the 
tubes slowly cool. However, if process flow is reintroduced to the heater 
during this cooling period, a serious problem may result. The first 
few gallons of process liquid flowing through the heater will become 
extremely hot. The liquid may get so hot that it will turn to solid coke 
and partially plug the heater tubes.
If this problem—the sudden loss of flow, followed by the pre-
mature restoration of flow—occurs repeatedly over a period of a 
few hours, then layers of fouling deposits or coke are accumulated 
inside the tubes until a heater shutdown becomes unavoidable. 
This sort of failure is called a stuttering-feed interruption.
Modern technology has come a long way in mitigating such prob-
lems. In new heaters, lightweight ceramic tiles, rather than massive 
brick refractory walls, are the norm. These ceramic tiles do not store 
very much heat. Hence, when the heater process flow is reduced or 
lost, as long as the fuel flow is quickly curtailed, the tubes tend not to 
overheat.
30.1.3  Adiabatic Combustion
In 1980, there was a strike at the Amoco Oil Refinery in Texas City. I 
was assigned during this emergency to work as the chief operator 
on the sulfur plant. You see, I was the engineer who had designed 
the sulfur plant. Therefore, Larry Durland, the refinery manager, 
thought that I would be the logical person for the chief operator’s job. 

	
406	
C h a p t e r  T h i r t y
To be honest, I was a scab. I know I was a scab, because when the 
hourly operators returned to work, they gave me a gift: a T-shirt. On 
the front it said “SCAB.” On the back it said, “I like cheese,” meaning 
I was a rat!
A sulfur plant converts H2S to elemental sulfur through the par-
tial oxidation of H2S:
 
H2S + O2 + N2 → H2O + N2 + S (vapor) 
(30.1)
This reaction takes place in an adiabatic-combustion chamber, 
shown in Fig. 30.1. This chamber has no tubes to absorb radiant 
heat. Plenty of radiant heat is liberated, but only to the refractory 
brick walls. The bricks then reradiate the heat back into the gas-
eous products of reaction. This is called adiabatic combustion 
because no heat is lost from the combustion reaction to radiation. 
The adiabatic-combustion temperature for the preceding reaction 
[Eq. (30.1)] is about 2300°F. The refractory used to contain this 
high temperature is manufactured from 90 percent alumina. Such 
refractory may be exposed to temperatures of up to 2900°F with-
out damage.
During the strike, the sulfur plant was shut down for minor 
repairs. I had to supervise its start-up. Mainly, I had to reheat the 
adiabatic-combustion chamber to 1800°F before restoring the flow 
of H2S. This was done by burning a controlled amount of methane 
or natural gas with a carefully regulated flow of air. The idea was 
to slowly heat up the combustion chamber with hot flue gas by 
100 to 200°F per hour. This slow reheat was needed to avoid crack-
ing the refractory bricks because of uneven heating. To carry away 
a portion of the heat of combustion of the natural gas, we used 
pipeline nitrogen.

I thought it best to control the flows of nitrogen, natural gas, 
and air, myself. Basically, the other scabs at the sulfur plant were 
head office people, whom I did not trust. The reheat phase of the 
start-up seemed to be going quite slowly. The combustion cham-
ber temperature crept up by 50°F an hour, rather than the normal 
150°F per hour. To speed the reheat, I reduced the nitrogen flow. 
This helped, but not by much.
It all seemed so odd. Especially as the interior of the chamber, 
viewed through the sight-port (see Fig. 30.1), had a dazzling white 
appearance. I remember thinking, “I cannot spend the rest of my life 
out here. I will have to speed this along.” So I shut off the nitrogen 
and turned up the gas and air. Finally, the chamber temperature 
started to climb at a respectable rate. But then I began to see some-
thing in the chamber that was utterly impossible.
Of course, peering through the glass sight-port, it is hard to see 
very well. But it seemed to me as if the opposite refractory wall was 
very slowly, but still perceptibly melting. But this could not be, for 
several good reasons:
• Reason number one: The 90 percent alumina refractory was 
rated for 3000°F service.
• Reason number two: The indicated combustion chamber tem-
perature was still only 1500°F.
• Reason number three: I am a nice person, and bad things should 
not happen to nice people.
After two hours, it became clear that the openings in the opposite 
refractory wall were shrinking. These openings permitted the hot 
flue gas to exit the combustion chamber and flow into the tubes of a 
heat-recovery boiler. The apparently melting refractory was sagging 
and restricting these apertures.
I noticed, with a sinking heart, that the combustion chamber pres-
sure was steadily rising. It rose from 2 to 12 psig, at which point the 
fuel gas tripped off as a result of the high pressure. The sulfur plant 
start-up was aborted! But what had happened?
An investigation showed that the thermowell—a steel or 
ceramic tube containing the thermocouple wires—was not fully 
inserted into the adiabatic-combustion chamber. The end of the 
thermowell was only half way into the 12-inch-thick refractory 
wall, as shown in Fig. 30.2. Therefore, the thermocouple was mea-
suring the relatively cool zone inside the refractory wall, rather 
than the far hotter zone in the combustion chamber. I should have 
paid closer attention to the physical appearance of the chamber. 
Bricks glowing bright red are radiating heat at about 1500°F. 
Bricks glowing a dazzling white are radiating heat above 2800°F 
(see Table 30.1).

How hot did the refractory surface get? This value can be calcu-
lated if we assume the following:
• Fuel was 100 percent methane.
• Complete combustion (implying theoretically perfect air/fuel 
gas mixing).
• No excess oxygen.
• No heat losses to surroundings.
• Air is available at 60°F.
• Pipeline nitrogen shutoff.
Then the calculated temperature of the combustion chamber is 
3800°F. This is called the adiabatic flame temperature. Such a tempera-
ture is quite sufficient to turn even bricks into a high-viscosity, lava-
type, semisolid fluid.
Larry Durland, the refinery manager, was not particularly pleased. 
He unjustly blamed me for this incident. Just because I had designed 
the sulfur plant, was the chief operator, and had been personally 
restreaming the sulfur plant, he said it was all my fault, and that I 
should have known better.
30.2  Heater Tube Failures
Heater tubes are designed to operate at a particular pressure and 
temperature. The design pressure of the tube is not the inlet operating 
pressure of the heater. The design tube pressure is the heater charge 
pump dead-head, or shut-in, pressure, as discussed in Chap. 34. The 
design temperature of the tube is not the heater outlet process operat-
ing temperature. The design tube temperature is the anticipated or 
calculated maximum tube skin temperature (at end-of-run conditions), 
which is simply the temperature of the exterior metal surface of the 
tube. Many plants call this temperature the tube metal indication (TMI).
The calculated tube skin temperature is mainly a function of the 
fouling resistance assumed inside the tube. The greater the assumed 
fouling resistance, the higher the design tube skin temperature, and 
the thicker the tube wall. In a sense, then, we partially assume the 
design tube thickness, on the basis of experience, for a particular 
plant service.
A typical process heater tube diameter is 4 to 10 inch. Tube thick-
ness is usually between 0.25 and 0.50 inch. Heater tubes are often 
constructed out of chrome steel. A high chrome content is 13 percent. 
The chrome content increases the heat resistance of the tube. A tube 
with a 11 to 13 percent chrome content can normally withstand a skin 
temperature of up to 1300 to 1350°F. A low-chrome-content tube of 
perhaps 3 percent may be limited to 1200°F tube metal temperature. 

	
410	
C h a p t e r  T h i r t y
Naturally, the pressure, thickness, and diameter of the tube all affect 
its maximum skin temperature limitations.
For added corrosion and temperature resistance, the nickel con-
tent of tubes and sometimes the Moly (molybdenum) content as well 
are increased. Tubes with a high nickel content are classified as 300 
series stainless steels. A 0.5 percent silicon content is used to enhance 
the tube’s oxidation or exterior scaling resistance.
I had a job working in India last year. The unit bottleneck that I 
was consulting for was the furnace. Both the firing rate and TMI tem-
perature were low. However, the tubes themselves were ordinary 
carbon steel (c.s.). Not only the convective tubes, but the radiant 
tubes, all were carbon steel. Theoretically, engineering calculations 
showed c.s. was adequate. Note that the furnace specs were issued by 
an American contractor, and not the locals.
Theory is fine. But it needs to be tempered with common sense. 
Process heaters in refinery hydrocarbon service should employ 
chrome steel and not c.s. tubes in the radiant wall and shock tubes. 
Carbon steel tubes should be confined to the convective section.
30.2.1  High-Temperature Creep
When the tube metal temperature exceeds a value of 1300 to 1400°F, 
it becomes plastic. This means that the pressure inside the tube causes 
the tube diameter to expand. This is called high-temperature creep. As 
the diameter of the tube bulges and expands, the tube walls become 
progressively thinner and ultimately too thin to constrain the pres-
sure inside the tube, and the tube bursts. Large-diameter tubes 
operating at higher pressures and with a thin wall thickness fail at a 
relatively low tube skin temperature.
Tubes seldom fail because of external oxidation, and tubes rarely 
“burn up.” They fail because of high-temperature creep, which causes 
the tube to expand and burst. Thus, the fundamental cause of tube 
failure is a high localized temperature, which is called a “hot spot.”
30.2.2  Purge Steam
When a heater tube fails, the process fluid spills out into the firebox. 
Let’s assume that the process fluid is a combustible liquid. Will the 
leaking process fluid burn? There is probably not enough excess 
oxygen in the firebox to support a substantial amount of additional 
combustion.
Flames and black smoke will pour out of the heater’s stack. It 
looks very dangerous, but it is really not. There is not enough excess 
oxygen in the firebox to cause a very high temperature. The com-
bustion gases, or flue gas, are too fuel-rich to explode. We say that the 
flue gas is above the explosive region.
To prevent the flue gas from exploding, we need to proceed cau-
tiously. If we just block-in the leaking process tubes and fuel-gas supply, 

	
F i r e d  H e a t e r s :  P r o c e s s  S i d e 	
411
the fuel gas content of the flue gas will gradually decrease. The air:fuel 
ratio in the flue gas will increase until the flue-gas composition enters 
the explosive region. If the firebox refractory walls are still hot enough 
to initiate combustion, the firebox will now explode.
This happened on a unit I was supervising. A score of operators 
were lying on the concrete with their polyester shirts burning. This 
incident happened in 1982, before the need to wear fire-retardant 
Nomex coveralls was recognized.
The correct way to prevent this sort of firebox explosion is to use 
firebox purge steam. A typical heater firebox might have a half dozen 
purge steam connections. The idea is to displace the air in the firebox 
with steam. Then the flows of combustible process liquid and fuel gas 
may be safely stopped without fear of entering the explosive region. 
This purge steam is different from the coil purge steam used in the 
heater’s tubes.
Purge steam is sometimes called snuffing or box steam. I have a 
few rules about the design and operation of this system to ensure its 
safe use:
•	 Locate the steam valves at least 30 meters back from the 
heater.
•	 The steam line must be heat traced and insulated to prevent 
water accumulation.
•	 Steam traps both up and downstream of steam snuffing 
valves are needed.
•	 These valves must be greased and exercised once or twice a 
year. Valves should have grease nipples.
Blowing steam condensate into an 1800°F firebox with a failed 
tube blowing out vacuum resid is best avoided. Your ability to train 
the operators as to how to react in these sorts of emergencies is the 
test of a good supervisor. 
30.2.3  Identifying Thin Tubes and Hot Spots
A bulging tube indicates a thin area of a tube. If the diameter of a tube 
were to uniformly increase by 20 percent, then the thickness of the 
tube would decrease by 20 percent. But tubes rarely expand uni-
formly. They expand mainly on that side of the tube that is hottest. 
Hence, a tube bulge that increases the overall tube circumference by 
20 percent typically reduces the thickness of the tube in the area of the 
bulge by 40 percent. For many tubes, this reduction in thickness is 
sufficient to cause tube failure. There is no theoretical basis for these 
statements. It is just a summary of what I have seen when a section of 
tubing is cut from a heater for failure analysis (see Fig. 30.3).
The best way to find thin, bulging tubes when the heater is 
offline is to run a metal ring down the length of a tube. A severe 

	
412	
C h a p t e r  T h i r t y
bulge may be visually observed even when the heater is in service. 
Sagging tubes do not represent thin tubes. I have seen radiant-
section, horizontal tubes sag by more than one tube diameter and 
operate for years without failing.
30.2.3.1  Identification of Hot Spots
Localized overheating of a tube causes localized high-temperature 
creep. This leads to the plastic deformation of a tube and hence thin 
tube walls. Such hot spots are indicated by the color of the tube, as 
shown in Table 30.1. This chart is not a function of the material of the 
tube. Carbon steel tubes, as well as tubes of all alloys, glow with a 
color that corresponds only to the localized tube temperature. This is 
the principle of operation of the optical pyrometer, a device that is 
widely used in the process industry to remotely measure tube skin 
temperatures.
Sometimes, deposits accumulate on the exterior of tubes. These 
deposits are unavoidable when heavy industrial fuel oil is fired. Such 
fuel oils contain high concentrations of vanadium, nickel, sodium, 
and iron (in that order of concentration). These metals deposit as an 
ash on the exterior of both the radiant- and convective-section tubes. 
The ash will get very hot and will turn sections of tubes yellow or even 
whitish silver. This is not an indication of tube overheating. If the 
Coke

F i r e d  H e a t e r s :  P r o c e s s  S i d e 	
413
deposits get thick enough, they will interfere with the rate of heat 
absorption by the tube. It is very difficult to distinguish between a real 
hot spot and glowing ash. Dirty fuel gas also leads to ash formation on 
the radiant surface of tubes.
Fuel oils that contain both vanadium and sodium are a special 
problem. I’ve discussed this problem in a later example dealing with 
corrosion. The difficulty is that a mixture of 99 percent vanadium and 
1 percent sodium forms a eutectic mixture, which melts at about 
1300°F. The viscous liquid that results is corrosive. I’ve seen rapid 
rates of localized tube thinning on vertical, radiant section of tubes.
If the deposits don’t melt, they will accumulate on the surface of 
the radiant section tubes. I’ve seen an 0.125 inch of vanadium evenly 
coating a 300 mm Btu/hr heater. A heater flux rate of 14,000 Btu/hr/ft2 
had been sustained for five years with no tube damage. The vana-
dium acted as a protective coating for the tubes, except where it 
melted and caused a tube leak.
30.2.3.2  What Causes Hot Spots?
Four conditions will promote the formation of hot spots on tubes:
	
1.	 Flame impingement.  This is often caused by dirty burner tips, 
lack of combustion air, poorly designed burners, high burner 
tip pressure, improper adjustment of the burner, or improper 
draft. I have seen a heater in Cartagena, Colombia, with the 
flames being forced outward against the upper radiant wall 
tubes. The problem was an extreme positive pressure in the 
firebox, due to excessive pressure drop of the flue gas in the 
fouled convective section.
	
2.	 Poor radiant-heat distribution.  A high localized radiant-heat flux 
(in Btu/[(h)(ft2)] of tube surface area) will result in a hot spot. A 
moderate average radiant-heat flux for a process heater might 
be 12,000 Btu/[(h)(ft2)]. However, if heat distribution is poor, the 
local radiant-heat flux could be 20,000 Btu/[(h)(ft2)]. This is 
excessive for most services. The cause of the poor radiant-heat 
distribution could be sagging tubes, too small a firebox for the 
heat released, or inadequate tube spacing. Having many small 
burners rather than just a few large burners promotes more even 
radiant-heat distribution. Figure 30.4 shows a double-fired 
heater. This type of heater results in excellent heat distribution 
and can tolerate average radiant-heat fluxes 15 to 25 percent 
higher than conventional heaters with radiant wall tubes.
	
3.	 Interior tube deposits.  Coke, salts, and corrosion products can 
adhere to the inside wall of the tube. The deposits precipitate 
out of the flowing fluid, due to low tube-side velocity. Once the

fluid can no longer effectively cool that portion of the tube wall

covered with these internal deposits. The minimum acceptable 
tube-side velocity to retard solids sticking to the tube wall 
really depends on the service. A few general guidelines are
• Mixed-phase vapor and liquid flow, 20 ft/s
• Liquid-only flow, 8 ft/s
	
	 When a tube that has failed because of a hot spot caused by a 
coke deposit inside is cut in half, we would observe a pattern 
similar to that shown in Fig. 30.3.
 
4. Dry-point deposits.  We sometimes see that a certain heater 
tube will glow a light red and fail for no apparent reason. The 
particular tube position in the firebox seems to be far more 
subject to failure than its neighbors. The tube is not located in 
an area of flame impingement, and the tubes upstream and 
downstream are a nice dark red (see Table 30.1).

This strange behavior is likely due to the heater feed going 
through its dry point in this tube position. Let’s say that the heater 
feed is 10 weight percent (wt.%) liquid. The heater effluent is 
100 percent vapor. Unfortunately, the liquid portion of the heater feed 
is likely to contain small amounts of dissolved, or suspended, solids. 
The concentration of these solids increases in the liquid as the liquid 
vaporizes. When the liquid dries out, the solids stick to the wall of the 
tube. The radiant heat absorbed by the tube can no longer be effi-
ciently removed from the tube wall by the flowing vapor. The tube 
overheats and bulges, the walls thin at the bulges, and the tube bursts.
30.3  Flow in Heater Tubes
30.3.1  Loss of Flow
Let us say we have an ordinary orifice-type flowmeter, as shown in  
Fig. 30.5 (see Chap. 10, “How Instruments Work”). What happens if 
the low pressure (i.e., the downstream) orifice tap plugs? Does the 
indicated flow go up or down?
If a pressure tap plugs, the measured pressure will decrease. The 
measured pressure difference across the orifice plate will increase. 
Tap plugs

C h a p t e r  T h i r t y
The indicated flow will go up. If the flowmeter is controlling a flow-
control valve on a tube inlet to a heater, the valve will then close. 
Flow to the tube inlet will be lost. The tubes downstream of this 
flow-control valve will likely be damaged because of overheating, or 
they will plug and foul as a result of thermal degradation of the pro-
cess fluid.
One way to limit the damage due to this all-too-common problem 
is to limit the amount the flow-control valve can close on automatic 
control to, say, 20 percent open. Make sure, though, that with the 
valve 20 percent open, enough flow is sustained through the tubes to 
prevent tube damage due to too low a process flow.
30.3.2  Annular Flow
Sometimes the liquid flow through a heater tube is low. Low flow 
promotes thermal degradation of the liquid and harmful buildup of 
deposits inside the tubes. To combat this problem, we often add veloc-
ity steam to the heater’s tubes to increase the linear velocity of the oil. 
However, if the physical properties, especially the density, of the oil 
and steam are very different, phase separation will result. This means 
that the low-density steam will run down the center of the tube. The 
higher-density liquid will creep along the periphery of the tube at a 
much lower velocity. This sort of phase separation is called annular 
flow. When a tube is in this flow regime, increasing steam velocity 
further does very little to increase the liquid velocity or in combating 
the thermal degradation of the liquid.
30.4  Low-NOx Burners
NOx stands for a variety of nitric oxides. Many heaters in the 
United States have been retrofitted with staged burners in the last 
decade or so. These staged burners combust the fuel in two or three 
stages. For example, in the burner shown in Fig. 30.6, 50 percent of 
the fuel is burned with 100 percent of the air. The flame produced by 
this first stage of combustion radiates heat to the process tubes and 
refractory walls. Next, the remaining 50 percent of the fuel is added 
around the circumference of the first-stage burner. This second stage 
of combustion also liberates radiant heat. But because the radiant 
heat is liberated in two steps, the maximum flame temperature is 
reduced. This has two favorable results:
 
1. Nitric oxide (NOx) production is reduced, as the oxidation of 
nitrogen is a strong function of the flame temperature. Hence 
the term low-NOx burners.
 
2. Heat liberation from the low-NOx burner is more uniform 
than with a conventional burner. This permits a higher aver-
age firebox temperature to be sustained, without promoting

hot spots on the tubes and interior tube coking. I have recently 
seen a refinery crude unit vacuum tower feed heater expanded 
by 15 percent, simply by retrofitting with two-stage, low-
NOx, fuel-gas burners. These burners replaced old-fashioned 
burners that did a poor job of mixing the air and fuel gas.
Premix, or primary-air, burners do a great job of mixing air and 
fuel gas. But they also produce a high flame temperature and hence, 
higher concentrations of NOx in the heater’s effluent flue gas.
30.5  Tube Fire-Side Heaters
So far, we have been discussing fired heaters, with the fire outside the 
tubes; that is, the fire is outside the heat-exchange surface. Many fired 
heaters have the fire, or at least the hot flue gas, inside the heat-
exchange surface.
One common example of firing on the tube side of a heater is the 
glycol-regeneration boiler, shown in Fig. 30.7. This type of heater will 
typically have a high excess O2 to prevent high flame temperatures, 
which could overheat the fire tube. Also, the fire tube is kept submerged 
in liquid to prevent tube overheating.
In multiple-tube boilers (usually horizontal) the fire may be on 
the tube side. As long as the fire tubes are kept submerged in water, 
the tubes do not overheat. Boilers of this type are widely used in the 
regeneration of spent sulfuric acid, and in the production of elemental 
sulfur from hydrogen sulfide.

	
418	
C h a p t e r  T h i r t y
The great difficulty with such fire-side, multitube boilers is 
overheating the hot-side tubesheet. This tubesheet is exposed to the 
full temperature of the combustion gases, but is difficult to keep 
cool with the boiler’s feedwater. Also, the ends of the tubes, where 
they are sealed in the tubesheet, are hard to keep cool. To protect 
these ends from the direct radiant heat in the combustion chamber, 
ferrule inserts, about 2 inches long, are cemented into the front end 
of each tube.
If these ferrules fail, or if the tubesheet overheats, the ends of the 
tubes will pull away from the tubesheet. The result is called a “roll 
leak.” Boiler feedwater will blow out of these roll leaks. Rerolling and 
seal welding the ends of the tubes, while difficult, is then the only 
way to stop such leaks.
Old style steam locomotives were boilers on wheels with the fire 
on the tube side. I visited one just last month. Abandoned on a rail-
road siding in New Orleans 50 years ago, it almost looked ready to 
raise steam again. Its tubesheet was visible from the fireman’s door.

Refrigeration 
Systems
An Introduction 
to Centrifugal Compressors
W
aste heat must occasionally be removed from a process at 
below-ambient temperatures. This is normally accomp-
lished by evaporating a light fluid called a refrigerant. 
Common industrial refrigerants are
• Ammonia
• Propane
• Freon
Your home central air-conditioning system is a good example of a 
simple refrigeration loop. Figure 31.1 illustrates the basic components:
• Refrigerant motor-driven compressor
• Refrigerant condenser
• Refrigerant letdown valve
• Evaporator
• Refrigerant receiver
The basic process flow of the refrigerant system is:
 
1. The compressed refrigerant vapor is discharged from the 
compressor. This vapor is superheated, meaning that it is above 
its dew-point temperature.
	
2.	 The vapor is next cooled and condensed in the refrigerant con-
denser. Typically, 75 to 80 percent of the condenser heat duty is 
the latent heat of condensation of the refrigerant. The remain-
ing heat duty is sensible-heat removal. The sensible heat 
419

	
420	
C h a p t e r  T h i r t y - O n e
removed is a combination of desuperheating the vapor and 
subcooling the condensed liquid refrigerant.
 
3. The subcooled refrigerant next flows into the refrigerant receiver. 
Subcooled means that the refrigerant temperature is below its 
boiling point or bubble-point temperature. The liquid refriger-
ant loses a small amount of pressure as it enters the receiver. The 
pressure loss is due to friction in the piping and an increase in 
the elevation of the refrigerant as it enters the receiver.
	
4.	 The condensed liquid refrigerant next flows through the 
letdown valve. In Fig. 31.1, this letdown valve is not control-
ling the receiver liquid level. The receiver level is allowed to 
vary as the total refrigerant inventory changes. This idea 
can be better understood if we remember that this is a closed 
system. That is, we have to take swings in the refrigerant 
inventory somewhere in the system.
	
5.	 The refrigerant liquid partially flashes to a vapor as it flows 
through the letdown valve. The flashing represents the con-
version of the sensible heat of the refrigerant to latent heat 
of vaporization. In Fig. 31.1, the refrigerant is chilled from

100 to 40°F. Approximately 25 percent of the liquid flashes 
to a vapor to provide this autorefrigeration.
	
	   The compressor, motor, condenser, receiver, and letdown 
valve are all components of your home central air-condition-
ing unit. They are installed as a package, surrounded by the 
condenser, outside your house. The evaporator is located in 
your attic. To continue our description of the process flow:
	
6.	 The partially vaporized refrigerant flows into the evaporator. 
In Fig. 31.1, the evaporator shown is similar to a kettle-type 
reboiler (see Chap. 8). The process fluid flows through the 
tube side of the kettle evaporator. The refrigerant liquid level 
is maintained by the letdown valve. The refrigerant vapor 
flows from the top of the kettle to the compressor suction.
	
7.	 The motor-driven compressor boosts the pressure of the 
refrigerant vapors from the evaporator pressure up to the 
condenser pressure.
31.1  Refrigerant Receiver
Looking at Fig. 31.1, the need for the refrigerant receiver is not imme-
diately obvious. It does not appear to serve any process function. 
Many refrigerant systems are constructed without this vessel. How-
ever, it does have several important uses. For one thing, it provides a 
quiet zone for entrained lubricating and seal oils to settle out.
Lubricating and seal oil often leak into the circulating refrigerant. 
The lower the suction pressure of the compressor, the greater the 
problem. Eventually, the amount of heavy oil that accumulates in the 
evaporator will cause a problem. The heavy oil is largely insoluble 
in the refrigerant. As the refrigerant boils away out of the evaporator, 
the heavy oil is left behind. This oil partly coats the refrigerant tubes. 
The heat-transfer efficiency of the evaporator is reduced.
Turbulence caused by the boiling of the refrigerant prevents effi-
cient draining of heavy oil from the evaporator. However, if the 
refrigerant receiver has been designed properly, it can be used to trap 
out the heavy lubricating oil.
31.1.1  Inventory Control
In Fig. 31.1, there are two levels that must be controlled: the evapo-
rator level and the refrigerant receiver level. It is impossible to con-
trol both levels with two level-control valves. One level must be 
held with a level-control valve. The other level must be held by 
adjusting the system liquid refrigerant inventory. It is usually bet-
ter to add makeup refrigerant to keep a decent liquid level in the 
receiver and control the flow of refrigerant into the evaporator. 
However, reversing this control scheme by adjusting inventory 
control in the evaporator is also possible.

	
422	
C h a p t e r  T h i r t y - O n e
31.1.2  Vapor Trap
Another way of looking at the receiver vessel is to think of it as a giant 
steam trap. As long as the liquid level is maintained in the receiver, 
uncondensed refrigerant vapors cannot escape from the condenser. Let’s 
assume that such vapors did escape from the condenser. If there were no 
refrigerant receiver vessel, these vapors would blow through the let-
down valve. Reducing the pressure of the vapors produces just a tiny bit 
of refrigeration as compared to vaporization of liquefied refrigerant.
Now let’s assume that there is a refrigerant receiver between the con-
denser and letdown valve. This traps any uncondensed vapors. The 
accumulation of these vapors raises the pressure in the receiver. This 
puts back-pressure on the condenser. The higher condenser pressure 
promotes more complete condensation of the refrigerant vapors.
Finally, the receiver will accumulate any non-condensable (or 
hard-to-condense) components that have accidentally entered the 
system. Air left in the vessels on start-up is one such example. Traces 
of methane and ethane in a propane refrigerant system are another. 
These light vapors may be vented from the top of the receiver during 
normal operations.
31.2  Evaporator Temperature Control
The system shown in Fig. 31.1 has no provision for controlling the 
evaporator temperature; this is controlled solely by the compressor 
suction pressure. The lower the compressor suction pressure, the 
lower the evaporator temperature. This is exactly how our home air 
conditioner works. If the evaporator temperature is too cold, what 
can we do? Well, if this were a steam turbine compressor, gas engine 
drive, or any other type of variable-speed driver, we could reduce the 
compressor’s speed. This would reduce the flow of refrigerant, and 
raise both the evaporator and compressor suction pressure.
But we are working with an ordinary AC (alternating-current) 
motor—which is a fixed-speed device. There are then three methods 
available to control the temperature in the evaporator: spillback, dis-
charge throttling, and suction throttling.
31.2.1  Spillback
Spillback bypasses the compressor discharge gas back to the compres-
sor suction. This is a relatively energy-inefficient way to increase the 
evaporator temperature. Spillback is discussed in Chap. 41, “Centrifugal 
Compressors and Surge.”
31.2.2  Discharge Throttling
Discharge throttling is also an energy-inefficient way to control the evap-
orator temperature. Even worse, if we are working with a centrifugal 
compressor, discharge throttling may cause the compressor to surge.

	
R e f r i g e r a t i o n  S y s t e m s 	
423
31.2.3  Suction Throttling
Suction throttling is the preferred method, as shown in Fig. 31.1.
Suction throttling also wastes energy. Whenever a control 
valve is partially closed in any service, energy is always wasted. 
But with a fixed-speed centrifugal compressor, it is still the best 
option. As the suction valve is closed, two things happen. The 
flow of refrigerant vapor to the compressor is reduced, and the 
compressor suction pressure drops. The reduction in the refriger-
ant vapor flow reduces the workload on the compressor. But the 
reduction in the suction pressure increases the compression ratio 
(discharge pressure divided by suction pressure). This increases 
the workload on the compressor.
As we will discuss in Chap. 41, increasing the compression 
ratio is a small effect on compressor workload as compared to 
decreasing the vapor flow as long as we are operating on the flat 
part of the compressor’s flow vs. the head performance curve, 
which is almost always the case for a centrifugal machine. Hence, 
suction throttling will significantly reduce the horsepower load on 
the compressor, as well as increase the evaporator temperature for 
a motor-driven compressor.
Suction throttling is usually done with a “butterfly” control valve, 
which has a very low pressure drop when it is wide open.
31.3  Compressor and Condenser Operation
31.3.1  Compressor Operation
Let’s say we have a centrifugal refrigeration compressor driven by a 
motor. The motor is tripping off because of high amperage. Should 
we open or close the suction throttle valve shown in Fig. 31.2? 
Answer—close it. Of course, both the evaporator vapor outlet tem-
perature and the process fluid outlet temperature will increase. But 
that is the price we pay for having too small a motor driver on the 
compressor. Does this mean that when our home air conditioner gets 
low on freon, our electric bill drops? Correct. But the price we pay is 
a hot home.
How about the compressor discharge pressure? What is this 
controlled by? Answer—the condenser. The compressor discharge 
pressure has nothing whatsoever to do with the compressor. And this 
statement is true regardless of whether the compressor is a recipro-
cating or centrifugal machine, or fixed- or variable-speed. It is the 
condenser temperature that determines the compressor discharge 
pressure.
Lowering the compressor discharge pressure can be achieved by pro-
viding cooler water to the refrigerant condenser. But how does this affect 
the horsepower load or electrical power demand on the compressor’s 

	
424	
C h a p t e r  T h i r t y - O n e
driver? It depends on how much the refrigerant vapor flow increases, as 
the compressor discharge pressure is reduced.
For instance, suppose we are working with a reciprocating 
compressor. This particular machine has a very small volumetric 
clearance and a very high volumetric efficiency (these terms are 
explained in Chap. 42, “Reciprocating Compressors”). With this com-
pressor, a significant decrease in discharge pressure will result in only 
a tiny increase in vapor flow. Therefore, the work or amp load on the 
driver will decrease.
On the other hand, suppose we are working with a centrifugal 
compressor. This particular machine has a flat operating curve. This 
means that a small decrease in discharge pressure will result in a 
large increase in vapor flow. Therefore, the load on this compressor’s 
driver will increase.
This discussion assumes that the compressor’s suction pressure is 
fixed. However, in the real world, this is rarely the case. As we lower 
the compressor discharge pressure, the compressor suction pressure 
will also decrease. This will have the normally beneficial effect of 
reducing the evaporator pressure and temperature.
Now that the evaporator is cooler, we could increase the flow 
of warm process fluid to the evaporator. Thus, improving the effi-
ciency of the condenser will increase the capacity of a refrigeration

system to cool. This happens mainly by lowering the compressor 
discharge pressure rather than producing a colder condensed 
refrigerant.
31.3.2  Condenser Operation
A closed-loop refrigerant condenser ought to be one of the cleanest 
services in a process plant. Even seal- or lube-oil leaks affect the evap-
orator efficiency, rather than the condenser. I have measured rather 
high (e.g., 140 Btu/[(h)(ft2)(°F)]) heat-transfer coefficients in such 
condensers, even after that condenser has been in service for several 
years since its last cleaning.
The most common problem with refrigeration condensers is 
condensate backup, rather than fouling (see Chap. 18). This may 
happen if the condenser outlet line is undersized. Let’s say that the 
pressure drop due to piping friction losses in this line is 10 psi. The 
refrigerant is isobutane. The isobutane cannot flash as it enters the 
refrigerant receiver. The reason it cannot partially vaporize is that 
there is no vapor outlet from the receiver. If it were to vaporize, it 
would slightly increase the receiver pressure. This would push up 
the liquid level in the condenser. Many of the tubes in the condenser 
would be submerged in the liquid refrigerant. The refrigerant would 
be subcooled below its condensation or bubble-point temperature. It 
would have to be subcooled, so that after the liquid lost 10 psi of 
pressure it would not flash.
To subcool isobutane so as to prevent it from vaporizing after 
losing 10 psi, the isobutane vapor pressure must be reduced by 
10 psi. This would, in turn, require cooling the isobutane by about 
5°F (see Fig. 14.1 in Chap. 14). Unfortunately, subcooling a liquid is 
difficult. This means that the heat-transfer coefficient for subcooling 
might be 30 Btu/[(h)(ft2)(°F)]. Even though the amount of heat to be 
removed in subcooling a refrigerant is small, it may require 30 percent 
of the tubes in the condenser to do the job. The reason is the low heat-
transfer coefficient for subcooling as compared to the high heat-
transfer coefficient for condensation.
The tubes in the condenser required for subcooling reduce the 
heat-transfer surface area required for condensation. In effect, the con-
denser shrinks. This makes it more difficult to liquefy the refrigerant 
vapor. The vapor is then forced to condense at a higher temperature 
and pressure. Of course, this raises the compressor discharge pressure. 
And, as we have seen in the previous section (Sec. 31.2), this increase 
in compressor discharge pressure invariably reduces the compressor’s 
capacity and may also increase the horsepower needed to drive the 
compressor.
An increase in the elevation of the receiver will reduce the pres-
sure of the liquid refrigerant. This loss in pressure due to increased 
elevation will also require an increase in the surface area of the con-
denser devoted to subcooling.

31.4  Refrigerant Composition
A very large percentage of refrigeration systems are not limited by the 
compressor driver horsepower, the condenser, or the evaporator. Many 
refrigeration systems are limited by either:
• Compressor suction volume limits
• The mechanical pressure rating of the compressor case or the 
refrigerant condenser shell
If the compressor is suction-volume-limited, we say that it is 
speed-limited. If the compressor is driven by an AC motor, its speed is 
determined by the motor speed and any connecting gears. If the com-
pressor is driven by a turbine, then the rated speed of the turbine 
limits the compressor speed.
31.4.1  Overcoming Speed Limits
While the actual cubic feet of refrigerant vapor to the compressor 
may be limited by the compressor’s speed, we can still overcome this 
bottleneck. The trick is to make the refrigerant lighter or more volatile. 
A lighter refrigerant will allow the evaporator, shown in Fig. 31.1, to 
operate at a higher pressure and/or a lower temperature. Increasing 
the suction pressure increases the density of the refrigerant vapor 
flowing to the compressor. Even though the volume of gas flow is 
constant, the weight flow of the circulating refrigerant can be 
increased. Yes, we can get 6 lb of manure in a 5-lb bag, if we make the 
manure denser.
For example, adding lighter propane to heavier isobutane in a 
refinery alkylation unit is a common practice to increase refrigerant 
circulation. But this will work only when the compressor’s driver has 
spare capacity.
Of course, in process operations, there are no free lunches. Spiking 
propane into isobutane also makes the lighter refrigerant more difficult 
to condense. This will raise the compressor discharge pressure. Also, 
the operating pressure on the shell side of the condenser will increase. 
If either piece of equipment does not have an adequate design pressure, 
then increasing the volatility of the refrigerant cannot be permitted.
I used this trick at the Amoco Texas City Refinery in 1975 to 
increase the refrigeration capacity of my sulfuric acid alkylation unit. 
When I was put in charge of this alky unit in 1974, I found that capac-
ity was limited to 18,000 BSD by the refrigerant circulation rate. I had 
plenty of compressor capacity, but as I increased the turbine speed to 
run my compressor faster and circulate more isobutane refrigerant, 
the compressor suction pressure declined to 1 psig.
Running the compressor suction below atmospheric pressure is 
possible, but dangerous. Oxygen can be drawn into the refrigerant 
loop due to minor air leaks in the suction piping. To avoid this 

	
R e f r i g e r a t i o n  S y s t e m s 	
427
potential hazard, one should always maintain a positive pressure at 
the suction of any refrigeration compressor.
To overcome this limitation, I increased the propane content of 
my circulating isobutane refrigerant from 5 to 10 percent. This 
required several hours. As the suction pressure rose due to the more 
volatile refrigerant, the operators increased the refrigerant compres-
sor speed and hence the refrigerant circulation rate.
Eventually, using this and other tricks, I increased unit capacity to 
25,000 BSD in 1976. Amoco Oil did not promote me as a consequence 
of my heroic success. But I remember, and that’s what really matters.
31.4.2  Pressure Rating Limits
The simplest way to lower the compressor discharge pressure is to 
reduce the cooling water temperature to the condenser. One trick is to 
use the cooling tower makeup water on a once-through basis to the 
refrigerant condensers. This supply of water is almost always 10 to 
20°F cooler than the cooling water supply.
Another way to reduce the compressor discharge pressure is to 
make the refrigerant heavier or less volatile. Adding isobutane to a 
propane refrigerant is one example. This will lower the suction pres-
sure to the refrigerant compressor shown in Fig. 31.1 and increase the 
actual volume of vapor flow. If the compressor is speed-limited, this 
will not be practical.
Adjusting the refrigerant composition does not significantly 
affect the amount of horsepower needed to provide a fixed amount of 
cooling at a certain evaporator temperature. This statement is true 
even if the type of refrigerant used is changed completely. Propane, 
isobutane, freon, and ammonia all have roughly the same refrigera-
tion efficiency.

CHAPTER 32
Cooling Water 
Systems
I 
don’t know how ordinary people, lacking an engineering back-
ground, take care of their swimming pools. Unless you have lots 
of time, money, and a degree in water chemistry, do not buy a 
home with a pool.
One thing my pool and process cooling water towers have in 
common is sludge. Perhaps you have driven past a refinery cooling 
tower with frothy, white foam billowing from its top. That’s caused 
by the following sequence of events:
	
1.	 A tube leak develops in a process condenser.
	
2.	 The process-side hydrocarbons leak into the cooling water 
return line.
	
3.	 The hydrocarbons in the circulating warm cooling water 
(70 to 100°F) promote the formation of algae.
	
4.	 The algae die, settle out on the cooling water distribution 
decks, and form a sludge. The sludge also fouls heat exchanger 
surfaces and the cooling water distribution piping.
	
5.	 The cooling tower is now shocked with chlorine to establish a 
chlorine residual of a few ppm. If the cooling tower is really 
dirty, this takes lots of chlorine.
	
6.	 The dead and dying algae mix with the air flowing through 
the cooling tower to form froth.
To maintain a clean cooling water system requires the mainte-
nance of a chlorine residual content of a few ppm. Organic mate-
rial leaking into the cooling water consumes chlorine. Without a 
residual chlorine content an organic sludge will form. Thus, the 
prerequisite for maintaining good heat transfers in cooling water 
exchangers is to eliminate hydrocarbon leaks into the circulating 
water system.

32.1  Locating Exchanger Tube Leaks
Open the high point vent on the top of the channel head. I am assuming 
water is on the tube side of a horizontal shell and tube exchanger. If the 
exchanger is elevated by 30 or 50 ft, there may be no water pressure at 
this elevation. If so, temporarily close the cooling water outlet gate valve 
part way to push the water out of the vent. Now take the gas test meter 
(the one used by the operators to issue entry permits to vessels) and 
hold the sample probe above the water stream to test for hydrocarbons.
Do not just plug the leaking tube and start back up. You need to 
determine the mechanism of the failure. The bad tube has to be 
extracted from the tube bundle. This is a somewhat difficult job usu-
ally requiring an outside contractor.
When you inspect the failed tube, it may well appear that 99 percent 
of the metal loss is inside the tube on the cooling water side. This sug-
gests that the failure is associated with water-side corrosion. However, 
if the metal loss is very localized, the problem is on the shell side. 
Process fluid has jetted through a pinhole leak. The resulting high 
localized velocity on the tube side creates areas of low pressure inside 
the tube. Oxygen dissolved in the cooling water can flash out of solu-
tion and corrode the surrounding surface of the tube. The problem 
I’m describing is called erosion-corrosion promoted by cavitation. 
Unless there are signs of general corrosion (thinning, pitting) inside 
the tubes, large localized tube leaks are due to shell-side, process 
fluid problems. You cannot draw any conclusions unless the leaking 
tube is first extracted from the tube bundle.
32.2  Tube-Side Fouling
Sea water fouls rapidly above 130°F. Circulating cooling tower water 
may cause excessive rates of salt deposits at temperatures above 120°F, 
depending on the cooling water quality. One common cooling water 
hardness deposit is calcium carbonate. Just as with a boiler, we need to 
blowdown some percentage of the circulating cooling water to control 
the total dissolved solid content of the water. The rate of blowdown is 
not adjusted based on the water circulation rate, but on the rate of 
water evaporation from the cooling tower. In many plants the required 
blowdown rate to meet the TDS content of the cooling water is zero. 
That’s because of leaks and losses in the circulating system.1
A large percentage of fouling deposits on the cooling water side of 
exchangers are manganese. This is mainly a result of biological activity, 
rather than contamination of the cooling water system makeup water. 
Effective chlorination will suppress such fouling with manganese salts.
One of the mistakes I have made in the past is due to air accumula-
tion in the channel head (see Fig. 32.1). That is, I’ve confused the effect 
of trapped air with fouling. Especially on start-up, air may be trapped 
both above and below the pass partition baffles. The air can fill some of 

	
C o o l i n g  W a t e r  S y s t e m s

the tubes, especially at lower tube velocities, and effectively reduce the 
exchanger surface area. Opening the vents on the channel head to vent 
out accumulated air is a good method to restore lost cooling capacity. 
Initially, I had confused this lost cooling capacity with fouling.
32.3  Changing Tube-Side Passes
Once my client in South Africa changed a water cooler from two-pass 
tubes to four-pass tubes (see Fig. 32.1), meaning that the water trav-
eled through half the number of tubes per pass. The water traveled 
twice as far, as it now went through the tube bundle four times.
The objective of this change was to increase the water tube-side 
velocity. Higher velocity means less fouling. But higher velocities are 
not possible, especially if the water has to travel further, unless 
the ∆P also increases. Most unfortunately, the ∆P on water-cooled 
exchangers cannot increase. It must remain constant regardless of the 
exchanger configuration. Let me explain.
Let’s say your sea-water pumps develop a 40-psig discharge pres-
sure. The sea-water return line operates at 5 psig. The pressure drop

of sea water flowing through the exchanger is 35 psig, regardless of 
the exchanger geometry. If the water flow is restricted by increasing 
the number of tube-side passes, then both total water flow and the 
tube-side velocity will decrease.
When my client in South Africa changed from two-pass to four-
pass, the water flow decreased from 1,000,000 lb/hr to 350,000 lb/hr. 
The method of calculation to derive the lower flow is somewhat com-
plex. The calculations take into account that the water has to flow 
twice as far through the tube bundle, and that there are only half the 
number of tubes available per pass, but that the water pressure drop 
must remain constant.
Due to the lower flow, the temperature increase of the sea water 
also went up:
• Two-pass: 70 to 100°F
• Four-pass: 70 to 150°F
At 150°F, the cooling water precipitated hardness deposits. The 
hardness deposits restricted water flow. The restricted water flow 
increased the water outlet temperature. The increased water temper-
ature reduced the water flow. The reduced water flow . . . but perhaps 
I have made my point. We changed back to the two-pass configura-
tion. Kindly compare this story to Chap. 26, “Shell-and-Tube Heat 
Exchangers” where tube passes were increased.
32.4  Cooling Tower pH Control
Effective chlorination of circulating cooling water requires proper pH 
control. Maintaining proper alkalinity also aids pH control and thus 
also improves the performance of chlorine in suppressing biological 
activity. A normal pH target is 6.5 to 7.0. If the pH rises well above this 
target, the cooling water basin becomes brown and murky. I guess 
that’s because the iron salts dissolved in the water precipitate out of 
solution. What I know for sure is that heat exchangers throughout the 
Amoco Refinery in Texas City fouled rapidly due to my operators 
accidentally overinjecting caustic into the cooling-water return line.
They quickly restored the pH with sulfuric acid. My operators over-
shot the target and drove the pH down to 4. The water became clear, 
clean, and corrosive. Leaks sprang out throughout the carbon steel 
water supply and return piping. Sulfuric acid is used because the pH of 
water naturally increases due to evaporation of water in closed systems.
32.5  Wooden Cooling Towers
Most older cooling towers in the United States are constructed of 
wood. The interior of the tower is filled with wooden slates. The lig-
nite in these wooden slates is removed by the circulating water and 

	
C o o l i n g  W a t e r  S y s t e m s 	
433
causes the slates to break. The failure of the slates degrades air-water 
contacting, which raises the supply water temperature to the process 
units. The two things that will accelerate the rate of lignite loss from 
the wooden components of the cooling tower are:
• High cooling water return temperature. Above 130°F is con-
sidered excessive.
• High residual chlorine levels. Above 2 or 3 ppm is considered 
excessive. Occasionally shocking the tower with chlorine is 
common practice, but should be done less than once per week.
32.6  Back-Flushing and Air Rumbling
The operators in the Esso Lago Refinery in Aruba used to blow nitro-
gen into the water inlet line to coolers. It’s safer to use nitrogen than 
air, in case there is a tube leak. They just coupled a 1-inch hose to the 
water inlet nozzle and blew in nitrogen for 10 minutes every day. I 
call this “air rumbling.” It helps to clean the tubes.
Back-flushing is more effective in clearing tubes than air rum-
bling. The cooling water supply line is closed. A valve draining the 
water to the sewer is opened on the inlet side of the exchanger. The 
drain, or back-flush valve, has to be at least half the diameter of the 
water supply piping. Water flows backward through the tubes until 
the water flowing to the sewer is clear. If the exchanger is elevated 
more than 20 or 30 ft, it’s probable that back-flushing is not possible, 
due to the lack of water pressure at the higher elevation. In Aruba, I 
installed a back-flush header pipe using high pressure firewater to 
supply pressure for back-flushing. Check with your plant’s safety 
division before you make such a modification.
Back-flushing is much more effective when it is done once a week, 
not as required. It prevents individual tubes from overheating due to 
low water flow and plugging off with hardness deposits. Once tubes 
are plugged with carbonate hardness deposits, the next step is acid 
cleaning, as such tubes cannot be cleared by back-flushing.
32.7  Acid Cleaning
It’s best to avoid acid cleaning. pH excursions in the cooling water 
circulating system are probable. Acid is injected into the water inlet, 
while a caustic neutralizing agent is injected into the water outlet. 
Acid cleaning is very effective for the exchanger being cleaned. 
However, the rest of the cooling water system is subjected to acceler-
ated rates of fouling and low pH corrosion, due to acid escaping 
from the exchanger this is being acid cleaned. Combating hydrocar-
bon leaks and improper water chemistry should minimize the need 
for on-line acid cleaning.

32.8  Increasing Water Flow
Your cooling tower basin is likely served by a number of circulation 
supply pumps. You may have observed that putting an additional 
pump on line does very little in increasing the combined pump dis-
charge pressure. This means that the total water flow has not 
increased. For example:
• Three pumps on: discharge = 48 psig
• Four pumps on: discharge = 50 psig
• Cooling-water return at grade for both cases = 10 psig
The ∆P for the three-pump case is 38 psig. The ∆P for the four-
pump case is 40 psig. That means the pressure drop through the 
exchangers and piping system has increased by 2 psi, or 5 percent. 
Since pressure drop varies with flow squared: 
∆P ~- (flow)2
The water flow has only increased by 2.5 percent by starting the 
fourth pump. This does not usually indicate a pump malfunction. 
More likely, it is an indication that all four pumps are operating on 
the flat portion of their pump curve. (see Chap. 34, “Centrifugal 
Pumps: Fundamentals of Operation.”) To get more water flow, you 
will need to reduce restrictions in the circulating system.
I was working in a refinery in New Jersey. The problem was lack 
of effluent cooling on a hydrotreater. I decided to increase cooling 
water flow through the effluent cooler by reducing the water flow 
through exchangers throughout the rest of the refinery. I reasoned 
that there was a single cooling tower that served the entire refinery. 
All the cooling water exchangers were piped-up in parallel. Thus, if I 
reduced water flow through some of these exchangers, I would divert 
more water to the hydrotreater effluent cooler.
I monitored progress by looking at both the process and water 
effluent temperatures on the hydrotreater cooler.
I throttled back on the cooling water flow to dozens of exchang-
ers. Several of these water coolers had not been used for years, but no 
one had bothered to block-in the water flow. Liz and I spent most of 
an afternoon on this activity. Based on the combined water tempera-
ture returning to the cooling tower (see Fig. 32.3), I had reduced the 
total circulating water flow by 20 percent. But the water flow to the 
hydrotreater effluent cooler had not increased at all.
Why? Because I was running on the flat portion of the cooling-
water supply pump performance curve.
Was there any reward for my efforts? Yes. The amperage load 
on the cooling water pump motor was reduced from 60 to 50 amps—an 
improvement that was of no interest to my client.

32.9  Piping Pressure Losses
For water flowing through clean pipes:
∆P = 0.15 × V2 ÷ (ID)
where ∆P = pressure loss per 100 ft of pipe, psi
	
V = velocity, ft/s
	
ID = pipe diameter, inch
The idea is to compare the measured and calculated pressure 
losses in the water system. In sea-water systems, the pipe lining may 
tear loose and restrict the water flow. I once found an isolation gate 
valve mostly closed, buried under a road crossing. It was a 30-inch 
valve. A maintenance crew spent two days working it open. The water 
flow only increased by 8 percent. The plant manager was quite angry. 
So the manager initiated a project to install a new 500-hp pump to run 
in parallel with the existing two 500 hp. As the existing pumps were 
already running on the flat portion of their performance curves, 
the incremental water flow observed when the new pump was com-
missioned was 2 percent.
32.10  Cooling Tower Efficiency
Two types of cooling towers are in widespread use: 
• Natural draft (see Fig. 32.2)
• Induced draft (see Fig. 32.3)
The giant natural-draft towers are used in Europe and in nuclear 
power plants in the United States. I’ve only worked with these tow-
ers in one refinery in Lithuania, and their performance was poor. Air 
flow is generated by the air inside the tower being heated by the 
warm cooling water. Also, the molecular weight of the evaporated 
water is less than the molecular weight of air. A few tenths of an inch 
of water draft may be developed.
The much smaller induced-draft cooling towers are used in pro-
cess plants throughout the Gulf Coast of Texas and Louisiana. Air 
flow is generated by large induced-draft fans.
Regardless of the type of cooling tower, the same criterion is used 
to gauge performance: the approach of the cooled water temperature 
compared to the air wet bulb temperature.
32.11  Wet Bulb Temperature
Water is not significantly cooled by exchanging sensible heat with 
cold air. Most of the cooling results from the humidification of the air. 
If you live in the Central Valley of California, your home is likely

cooled with a “swamp cooler,” rather than with a freon compressor. 
The water partially evaporates as it mixes with the dry air. The latent 
heat of evaporation of water is 1000 Btu/lb. If 2 percent of the water 
evaporates by contact with the cold air, the water loses 20 Btu/lb. The 
specific heat of water is one Btu/lb per 1°F. Thus, the water will be 
cooled by 20°F by evaporation.
It’s my mother’s mushroom soup story again (Sec. 1.4). Convert-
ing the sensible-heat content of the water into latent heat of evapora-
tion of the water. But for the air to carry away the evolved water 
vapor, it has to be below its dew-point temperature.
To gauge how efficiently a cooling tower is working requires two 
temperatures:
• The cooling water supply temperature leaving the basin.
• The wet bulb temperature of the ambient air. The air temperature 
itself is called the dry bulb temperature, which is not important.
To get the wet bulb temperature, turn on your TV. Switch to the 
weather channel. Read the current dew-point temperature, which is 
the same as the wet bulb temperature.
Alternatively, measure the wet bulb temperature as follows: 
Take a small piece of fabric and loosely wrap the bulb of a ther-
mometer, leaving a short tail of the fabric dangling below the 
thermometer. Dip the tail of fabric into water so that the water 
soaks all the way up the fabric that is covering the thermometer 
bulb. Now measure the ambient air temperature using the ther-
mometer with the fabric wrapped around its bulb. This is known 
as the wet bulb temperature. It will be lower than the dry bulb or 
ambient air temperature because the water vaporizing off the 
fabric cools the bulb of the thermometer.
Calculate the performance ∆T. This is the difference between the 
water leaving the tower and the wet bulb temperature. You can judge 
the performance of the cooling tower as follows:
• If the performance ∆T is 5°F or less and the temperature rise 
of the water (the return minus the supply) is 15°F or more, 
tower performance is excellent.
• If the performance ∆T is 8°F or less and the temperature rise 
of the water (return minus supply) is 30°F or more, the tower 
performance is also excellent.
• If the performance ∆T is 10°F and the warm water coming 
back to the cooling tower has increased in temperature by 
15°F or less, performance is poor. Note that the 15°F is called 
the water temperature rise.
• If the performance ∆T is 15°F and temperature rise of the 
water is 30°F, tower performance is poor.

	
438	
C h a p t e r  T h i r t y - T w o
In the older, induced-draft wooden cooling towers, a common 
problem is that the wooden slates have broken up. There is usually an 
access inspection door at the base of the cell. Often, the water distri-
bution holes are plugged or there are large holes broken into the deck. 
Water is not supposed to overflow around the outside of the cooling 
tower. On some cooling towers the fans are driven by belts, which can 
slip or the fan blade pitch is set too low, low being less than 15°, max-
imum being 23°.
So here’s another true story. April 1974, Texas City. I noted that 
the holes on my cooling tower distribution decks were blocked with 
a slimy sludge. I shut off the water to one cell and hired a crew of 
laborers to clean the deck. I did not think to provide safety harnesses 
or belts. Naturally, one of those guys fell off and broke his arm. Frank 
Citek, my boss, asked if I was crazy or stupid or both.
Actually, I was just ignorant, which is a curable deficiency. Next 
time, I first eliminated hydrocarbon leaks into the cooling water sys-
tem and chlorine shocked the cells, using bottled chlorine.
But this was even worse. Julia Tieneman, a young and inexperi-
enced operator in Texas City in 1974, was assigned to my unit. Why 
my foreman, old Henry Zipreian, chose Julia to connect the chlorine 
bottles to the water slip stream, I can’t say. Dear Julia got a whiff of 
chlorine and went off on temporary disability pay, which I charitably 
approved. 
Rather than stay home and recuperate, Julia went on vacation to 
Mexico. Most unfortunately, she ran into Ralph Samuels, the refinery 
human resources manager. Mr. Samuels complained to Frank Citek, 
my boss, “Why was Julia getting disability pay to cavort in Tijuana?” 
“Because,” Mr. Citek explained, “Lieberman is crazy and stupid.”

CHAPTER 33
Catalytic Effects: 
Equilibrium  
and Kinetics
W
hen I discuss a process problem, I’ll frequently qualify my 
views by stating, “Let’s assume equilibrium conditions 
have been reached.” What I’m doing is choosing to ignore 
the effect of time on changes in composition. I’m ignoring the effects 
of kinetics on the process. I’ll make such assumptions to simplify 
complex discussions. It’s a bad habit, which sometimes gets me into 
trouble.
33.1  Kinetics vs. Equilibrium
A reaction that is limited by equilibrium is finished. Waiting longer 
will make no difference. An example of this is the absorption of H2S 
from refinery fuel gas into an amine solution. Depending on the con-
centration of the H2S in the fuel gas, the amine solution will become 
saturated with H2S. Mixing the fuel gas and the amine solution for a 
longer period of time will not push more of the H2S into the amine 
solution. The reaction is complete, and we say the absorption of H2S 
by amine is limited by equilibrium.
On the other hand, a reaction that is limited by kinetics is not 
finished. Waiting longer will help to complete the reaction. An exam-
ple of this is the absorption of CO2 from refinery fuel gas into an 
amine solution. The CO2 will react with the amine to produce a 
stronger chemical bond than would the H2S and amine. CO2 reaction 
with amine goes slower than the H2S reaction with amine. Mixing 
the fuel gas and the amine solution for a longer period of time will 
push more of the CO2 into the amine solution. The reaction is incom-
plete, and we say the absorption of CO2 by amine is limited by kinet-
ics or time.
439

	
440	
C h a p t e r  T h i r t y - T h r e e
In the plant, then, we have two problems:
• H2S absorption is limited by equilibrium.
• CO2 absorption is limited by time.
We deal with these two problems by:
• To extract the residual H2S from fuel gas, we circulate more 
amine solution.
• To extract the residual CO2 from fuel gas, we have more con-
tacting trays in the absorption tower.
A similar problem occurs in the amine solution regenerator or 
stripper (see Fig. 33.1). The H2S strips out easily. Residual CO2, which 
is more tightly bound to the amine molecule, requires lots of trays 
and lots of steam to strip out.
33.2  Temperature vs. Time
If a reaction is too slow, there is a simple way to make the reaction go 
faster: higher temperature. Milk goes sour even in my 38°F refrigerator 
after a few months. The milk will go sour much faster if I leave it on our 
kitchen table at 74°F for a few days. Typically, for a nonbiological

reaction, the rate of reaction might very roughly double for every 30°F 
increase in temperature.
Regarding the example of CO2 absorption in amine solution, I 
said the CO2 absorption was limited by time or kinetics or reaction 
rate and not equilibrium. Perhaps I could increase the amount of CO2 
absorption in the amine solution by increasing the absorber tempera-
ture shown in Fig. 33.1.
Maybe yes, but maybe no. Maybe yes, because the reaction will 
go faster with higher temperature. But maybe no, because a higher 
temperature reduces the amount of CO2 that, at equilibrium, can be 
absorbed by the amine solution.
33.3  Purpose of a Catalyst
Increasing temperature to speed up a reaction is often a bad idea. If I 
have a plant that is desulferizing diesel oil with hydrogen, so as to 
convert the sulfur in the diesel to H2S, I can achieve the required per-
cent of sulfur removal in two ways:
• Mix the hydrogen and diesel together and wait a very long 
time.
• Mix the hydrogen and diesel together at a very high tempera-
ture (850°F).
At 850°F, desulferization will proceed quickly, but the diesel oil 
will also thermally crack to coke and gas and be useless as a fuel for 
trucks. What is wanted is a way to accelerate the conversion of the 
sulfur molecules attached to the diesel to H2S at a moderate tempera-
ture (about 700°F). That’s what a catalyst does. It does not change the 
equilibrium, it just makes the reaction go faster without having to 
increase the temperature.
For a catalyst to be effective in accelerating the rate of reaction, it 
has to come into contact with the molecules of the stuff that’s reacting. 
That’s why catalysts have lots of surface area. Most of the surface area 
of a pellet of catalyst can only be seen with a microscope. As we try to 
desulferize diesel oil, some small fraction of the hydrocarbon will turn 
to coke. The coke covers a tiny portion of the surface area of the catalyst. 
This slows down the rate of reaction between the hydrogen and sulfur 
molecules converting to H2S in the diesel oil. The sulfur content of the 
diesel product goes above spec. To reduce the sulfur content of the die-
sel below spec, the operator raises the temperature of the reactor. This 
makes the reaction go faster, which is good. But it also increases the rate 
at which coke deposits on the surface of the catalyst, which is bad. 
The extra coke blinds-off more catalyst area. The reaction rate drops. 
More sulfur is left in the diesel. The operator increases the reactor tem-
perature to speed up the reaction, which leaves more coke on the 
catalyst. When this game is over, we are at the “end-of-run condition.”

33.4  Lessons from Lithuania
Sometimes my habit of assuming equilibrium gets me into trouble. A 
few years ago I was hired by a refinery in Lithuania to redesign their 
hydrogen production plant, to increase plant capacity by 25 percent, 
and to reduce the CO2 content of the hydrogen product. The CO2 con-
tent of the hydrogen was 2 percent, and the new specification was 
0.5 percent CO2 in hydrogen product.
The process for CO2 absorption is the same as shown in Fig. 33.1. 
The only difference is that a potassium salt solution is used instead 
of the amine solution to absorb the CO2 from the hydrogen product. 
The potassium salt solution is called Catacarb, as shown in Fig. 33.2.
To accelerate the rate of absorption and deabsorption of CO2, a 
catalyst called LRS-10 is added to the Catacarb. I had ordered a fresh 
supply of LRS-10 catalyst for start-up. When I arrived in Lithuania, I 
was informed that the LRS-10 catalyst was stuck in customs and 
would be delivered any day now. I decided not to worry about the 
LRS-10 catalyst for two reasons:
	
1.	 The plant operations chief informed me that there was 
already a catalyst in the Catacarb solution that would be used 
for start-up. It was a di-ethanol amine catalyst, not LRS-10, 
but still it was a catalyst.
	
2.	 You can’t worry about everything.

443
As lower temperatures favor the absorption of CO2 by the Catacarb 
solution, I had expanded the capacity of the circulating Catacarb solu-
tion aerial fin-fan cooler to cool the absorber tower and thus reduce CO2 
in the H2 product. Liz stood next to me at the panel when we started the 
Catacarb circulation pumps. I was totally confident.
I forgot to mention that the operators in Lithuania didn’t like 
me. Nothing personal. It was just that they didn’t like Americans. 
So when the cooled Catacarb solution began to circulate, they were 
overjoyed. The CO2 content of the hydrogen product lined out at 
3.5 percent CO2, well above the previous level of 2 percent, and far 
above my target of 0.5 percent CO2 in the hydrogen product. 
Liz said that I went deathly pale. I was soaked with sweat in the 
chilly control room. The operations chief and panel room operators 
beamed with pleasure. Confused, I asked them to turn on the last 
fan on the aerial fin-fan solution cooler. The absorber temperature 
dropped by 10°F and the CO2 in the hydrogen product went up 
from 3.5 to 4 percent CO2.
“Any further instructions, Comrade Lieberman?” the unit chief 
happily inquired. I didn’t answer. I couldn’t breathe.
For the next three weeks I engaged in a titanic battle with the 
hydrogen plant. Fourteen hours a day, seven days a week:
• I raised the absorber pressure by 15 psi, which helped a bit.
• I lowered the deabsorber pressure by 3 psi, which helped a bit.
• I maximized the steam flow to the deabsorber reboiler, which 
helped a bit.
• I had open stripping steam piped up to the reboiler return 
nozzle, which helped a bit.
• I increased the circulation rate of the Catacarb solution, which 
helped a bit.
• I shut off one of the four aerial cooler fans on the lean Catacarb 
solution (see Fig. 33.2), which helped a lot.
So I shut off, one by one, over a period of days, all the aerial 
cooler fans. The absorber became quite hot and the CO2 dropped to 
0.5 percent in the H2 product. None of this made any sense. CO2 
absorption in Catacarb solution should be favored by lower, not 
higher, temperatures. Equilibrium conditions for CO2 absorption are 
always improved by cooling the circulating absorption liquid.
33.4.1  The Celebration Dinner
The general director of the plant, Nelson English (an American), 
invited Liz and me to a dinner to celebrate the 0.5 percent CO2. Wait-
ing for the main course, I thought about the problem. Why would 
raising the absorber temperature, clearly bad for equilibrium, reduce 

	
444	
C h a p t e r  T h i r t y - T h r e e
CO2 in hydrogen? Certainly absorption efficiency is improving, not 
because of equilibrium, but because of kinetics. It must be reaction rate 
or time limited. Otherwise, the higher temperatures in the absorber 
would never help.
“Mr. English,” I asked, “what about the LRS-10 catalyst? Has it 
cleared customs in Klipiada yet (the old German port of Memel)?”
33.4.2  Catalytic Effect
The catalyst was like a cold drink on a hot summer’s day. I put all the 
variables I had changed in three weeks back to normal conditions. 
I turned on all the aerial cooler fin-fans. The CO2 dropped below 
0.2 percent in the hydrogen product.
The lesson is, if raising reaction temperature in a reactor promoting 
an exothermic reaction makes the reaction proceed further, the reac-
tor is limited by kinetics and not equilibrium. The term “exothermic” 
means that heat is liberated in the reaction. How can one tell if the 
absorption of CO2 in the Catacarb solution is exothermic (gives off 
heat), rather than endothermic (absorbs heat)? Refer to Fig. 33.2. Note 
that both the hydrogen gas and the Catacarb liquid are being heated 
in the absorber. They are being heated by the heat of reaction between 
the CO2 and the potassium salt in the Catacarb solution.
33.5  Zero Order Reactions
Not all reactions are exothermic. Thermal cracking is an endothermic 
reaction. Heat is absorbed. Good thing, too. If thermal cracking of 
crude oil was exothermic, all the earth’s crude would by now have 
turned to coal and natural gas. Delayed cokers, visbreakers, and fluid 
catalytic cracking units are processes that are primarily endothermic 
in nature. A delayed coker operates with a zero order reaction. This 
means the rate of reaction depends on time in the coke drum and the 
temperature in the coke drum. The composition of the products of 
reaction have no effect.
On the other hand, hydrocracking is exothermic. The consump-
tion of hydrogen liberates heat in the hydrocracking reaction.
33.6  Runaway Reaction
In 1968, a 3000-psig vessel exploded. This unhappy event occurred at 
the ESSO Refinery in Bayway, New Jersey. The cause was a runaway 
reaction. Tar was being hydrocracked in an emulated bed of catalyst. 
The reactor got hotter, more hydrogen was consumed, and more 
exothermic heat of reaction was generated, which increased the rate 
of hydrogen consumption, which released more exothermic heat of 
reaction. I suppose if hydrogen feed had been stopped sooner, the 
runaway reaction could have been controlled. But it wasn’t and the 
reactor blew apart.

I had a similar, but less dramatic experience on a liquid-filled 
reactor converting propylene to viscous polypropylene (a gasoline 
additive). The catalyst was aluminum chloride added continuously 
with a small pump. The pump malfunctioned. During its outage we 
failed to stop feed to the reactor. The propylene content of the reactor 
increased. Finally, we restored the catalyst flow, but the liquid-filled 
reactor became very warm, very fast. Fortunately, an alert operator 
stopped the propylene feed to the reactor in time.
33.7  Common Chemical Plant and Refinery  
Catalytic Processes
33.7.1  Naphtha Reforming
This is an endothermic reaction in a hydrogen environment taking place 
in the vapor phase. The catalyst is the size of grains of rice and contains 
very costly platinum (which sells for twice the price of gold). The objec-
tive is to produce aromatics benzene, toluene, or xylene. Benzene and 
xylene are the basic building blocks of the chemical industry.
33.7.2  Steam-Hydrocarbon Reforming
This is also an endothermic process. The reaction takes place inside 
catalyst-filled furnace tubes. Heat is supplied to the tubes by furnace 
firing. Almost any hydrocarbon can be used—natural gas, propane, 
butane. The objective is to make hydrogen. Most of the world’s 
hydrogen is produced in this way. Half the hydrogen comes from 
steam and the other half from hydrocarbons. All of the carbon in the 
feed is converted to CO2 and vented. How hydrogen-powered cars 
will help global warming, I do not grasp.
33.7.3  Alkylation
This is a very exothermic reaction. Iso-butane and light olefines react 
to form iso-octane, a gasoline blending component with a 100 octane. 
That’s where the word “octane” comes from. Reaction takes place at 
50°F, in a liquid phase of either H2SO4 or HF acid.
33.7.4  Polymerization
This is an old process using a solid bed of phosphoric acid. Reaction 
takes place in the vapor phase. Feed is normally propylene. Products 
are hexane and nonane. Polymerization is a very exothermic process.
There is another sort of polymerization process used to produce 
viscous polypropylene. The reactor is a refrigerated kettle evaporator 
where the reaction takes place in the liquid phase. The catalyst was 
iso-propyl-chloride. The polypropylene product was used by Texaco 
in the 1960s as an engine top cylinder lubricant, added to gasoline.

One c.c. per gallon. The polypropylene was made at the Amoco refin-
ery in El Dorado, Arkansas. I produced several designs to expand 
plant capacity and participated in the plant start-up after each of my 
design changes was implemented.
Texaco and Amoco are gone. The refinery in El Dorado has van-
ished. All that remains is a picture on my wall of a young man in a 
round hard hat, leaning against the old poly reactor.
33.7.5  Sweetening
This is a slightly exothermic process. Mercaptains are converted to 
disulfides by adding air. The catalyst is a blue powder (Merox), which 
impregnates a bed of charcoal saturated with caustic. Converting 
mercaptains to disulfides reduces the bad smell of gasoline and jet 
fuel. The process takes place at about 100°F. Sulfur content of the 
product is not changed.
33.7.6  White Oil Hydrogenation
Motor oil is hydrotreated at 3000 psig and 450 to 650°F to remove all 
aromatic compounds by contact with hydrogen. The resulting white 
oil is used for baby oil, mineral oil, and ladies’ cosmetics. The white 
oil costs $5 per gallon to make and is sold for $30 an ounce in face 
creams.
33.7.7  Fluid Catalytic Cracking
Reaction takes place at 1000°F and low pressure in a riser pipe. The 
catalyst looks like white sand but is actually made of zeolites. 
The catalyst picks up coke from the endothermic cracking reac-
tion. The coke is burned off of the circulating catalyst with air. The 
catalyst gets hot (1200°F) and this supplies the endothermic heat of 
reaction. Half the gasoline sold in the United States is produced in 
this way. The original catalyst for this process was actually beach 
sand.
33.7.8  Sulfuric Acid
Sulfuric acid is produced by burning sulfur and H2S to SO2 with air. 
Then more air is added and reacted in a catalyst bed of vanadium 
pentoxide to produce SO3. The SO3 is mixed with water to make sul-
furic acid. The reaction is exothermic and takes place in the vapor 
phase. Sulfuric acid is, by weight, one of the main chemicals pro-
duced in the world. I spent 1974 to 1976 in charge of a sulfuric acid 
regeneration plant in Texas City. In 1975, I had 34 shutdowns and 
start-ups. I’ve kept a piece of lead wire, part of that awful plant, in my 
desk drawer. When things seem bad, that memento reminds me that 
it could be a lot worse.

CHAPTER 34
Centrifugal Pumps: 
Fundamentals  
of Operation
Head, Flow, and Pressure
M
ost of the pumps we see, both at home and at work, are 
centrifugal pumps. And most of these pumps are driven by 
constant-speed, alternating-current motors.
34.1  Head
Centrifugal pumps are dynamic machines, which means that they con-
vert velocity into feet of head.
To explain this concept of converting speed or velocity into 
feet of head, let’s look at Fig. 34.1. This is the water intake section 
of the Chicago Water Treatment Plant. Water flows from Lake 
Michigan into a large concrete sump. The top of this sump is well 
above the level of Lake Michigan. The line feeding the sump 
extends three miles (3 mi) out into the lake. The long line is 
needed to draw water into the plant, away from the pollution 
along the Chicago lakefront. The pipeline diameter is 12 ft. Water 
flows in this line at a velocity of 8 ft/s. Six pumps, stationed atop 
the concrete sump, pump water into the water treatment plant 
holding tanks.
One day, the plant experiences a partial power failure. Three of 
the six pumps shown in Fig. 34.1 shut down. A few moments later, 
the manhole covers on top of the sump blow off. Geysers of water 
spurt out of the manholes. What has happened?

34.1.1  Hydraulic Hammer
This is an example of water, or hydraulic, hammer. But what causes 
water hammer?
Let’s consider the change in the water velocity in the 3-mi pipe-
line when half the pumps failed. The velocity in the pipeline dropped 
from 8 down to 4 ft/s. Velocity is a form of energy, called kinetic energy. 
Energy can take several different forms:
• Heat (Btu)
• Elevation or potential energy
• Kinetic energy (miles per hour)
• Pressure (psig)
• Electrical power (amperes)
• Work (horsepower)
• Acceleration
• Chemical (heat of reaction)
About 250 years ago, Daniel Bernoulli first noticed two important 
things about energy:
• Energy in one form can be converted to energy in another form.
• While energy can be changed from one form to another, it 
cannot be created or destroyed.
This idea of the conservation of energy is at the heart of any pro-
cess plant. In the case of the Chicago Water Treatment Plant, the 
reduced velocity of the water was converted into feet of head. That is,

the elevation of the water in the sump suddenly increased and blew 
the manhole covers off the top of the sump.
34.1.2  Momentum
If the length of the pipeline had been a few hundred feet, this incident 
would not have happened. It is not only the sudden reduction of the 
velocity of the water that caused an increase of the water level in the 
sump. It is also the mass of water in the 3-mi pipeline that contributed 
to the increased height of water in the sump. The combined effect of 
mass times velocity is called momentum.
The mass of water in our pipeline weighed 160 × 106 lb. This much 
water, moving at 8 ft/s, represents a tremendous amount of energy 
(about 500 million Btu per hour). If the flow of water is cut in half, 
then the momentum of the water flowing in the pipeline is also cut in 
half. This energy cannot simply disappear. It has to go somewhere. 
The energy is converted to an increase of feet of head in the sump; 
that is, the water level in the sump jumps up and blows the manhole 
covers off the top of the sump.
Incidentally, this is a true story. Can you imagine what would 
have happened if all six pumps failed simultaneously due to an elec-
tric power failure? The result would be a dramatic lesson in the mean-
ing of water hammer.
34.1.2.1  Sayano-Shushenskaya Hydro Accident
In 2009, long after I penned the above words, the hypothetical inci-
dent I’ve described above did actually happen, with tragic results. A 
new hydroelectric plant had just come on stream in Siberia. It was 
the world’s sixth largest. An elaborate celebration tour was being 
held for the visiting dignitaries. Reportedly, a huge tree stump 
became lodged in the turbine blades of one of the giant water intake 
tunnels. The effect of the resulting hydraulic surge may be seen on 
http://en.wikipedia.org and www.youtube.com.
I’ve printed a few of the hundred odd photos available from 
the Internet. I use them to frighten the engineers in my trouble-
shooting seminars. Seventy-four people were killed in the plant. 
Check the photos out for yourself. Of course, within days of the 
disaster, the Russians had modified the story. But one picture is 
worth a thousand words.
34.1.3  My Washing Machine
Figure 34.2 is a picture of our washing machine as it was originally 
installed. Whenever the shutoff valve on the water supply line 
closed, water hammer, or hydraulic shock, would shake the water 
piping. The momentum of the water flowing in the piping would be 
suddenly converted to pressure. If the end of a piping system is open 
(as into a sump), then the momentum of the water is converted to 

	
450	
C h a p t e r  T h i r t y - F o u r
feet of head. But if the end of the piping system is closed, then the 
momentum of the water is converted to pressure.
To fix this problem, I installed the riser tube shown in Fig. 34.3. The 
top of the riser tube is left full of air. Now when the water flow in the 
supply pipe is shut, the momentum of the water is converted to com-
pression energy. That is, the air in the riser tube is slightly compressed, as 
indicated by the pressure gauge I installed at the top of the riser tube.
I invite the reader to compare my washing machine story to the 
accident at the Siberian hydroelectric plant. The lesson is that when 
we have fluid flowing in a very long pipe or channel, we have to con-
sider what will happen when the fluid flow suddenly stops. We do 
not want the momentum to be converted into pressure, but into com-
pression of a vapor or into potential energy.
For example, on a long crude oil transportation pipeline, we 
might have periodic surge drums located along the line to safely 
accommodate a sudden stoppage of the flowing crude.
An easy way to witness hydraulic surge for yourself is to install a 
pressure gauge at the suction of a centrifugal pump. Then shut down 
the pump. You will note a brief, but definite increase, in the pump’s 
suction pressure. This is the opposite of the effect I’ll now discuss.
34.1.4  Acceleration
Let us imagine that the six pumps in Fig. 34.1 have not run for a few 
days. The water level in the sump and the level of Lake Michigan will 
be the same. I now start all six pumps at the same time. An hour later, 
the water level in the sump is 12 ft below the water level in the lake.

451
This 12 ft is called “feet of head loss.” If the pipeline is 3 mi long, we 
say we have “lost 4 ft of head per mile of pipeline.”
If we look down into the sump, what would we see happening to 
the water level during this hour? Figure 34.4 is a graph of what we 
would observe. The water level in the sump would drop gradually to 
15 ft below the level in the lake. Then the water level in the sump 
would come partly back up to its equilibrium level of 12 ft below the 
lake level. Why?
The loss of 12 ft of head as the water flows through the pipeline is 
due to friction; that is, 12 ft of head are converted to heat. But why do 
we have a temporary loss of an extra 3 ft? The answer lies in the con-
cept of acceleration.
Let’s say you are driving your car onto the expressway. To 
increase the speed of your car from 30 to 65 miles per hour, you press 
down on the accelerator pedal. Having reached a velocity of 65 miles 
per hour, you ease off the accelerator pedal to maintain a constant 
speed. Why? Well, according to Newton’s second law of motion, it 
takes more energy to accelerate your car than to keep it in motion.
Referring again to Fig. 34.1, the water in the 3-mi pipeline is ini-
tially stagnant. Its velocity is zero. An hour later, the water has 
accelerated to 8 ft/s. When you accelerate your car, the extra energy 
required comes from the engine. But when we accelerate the water in 
the pipeline, where does the extra energy come from?
Does this extra energy come from the pumps? Absolutely not! The 
pumps are downstream of the pipeline and the sump. They cannot con-
tribute any energy to an upstream pipeline. No, dear reader, the energy to 
accelerate the water in the pipeline must come from Lake Michigan.

But what is the only source of energy that the lake possesses? 
Answer—elevation or potential energy. To accelerate the water in 
the pipeline to 8 ft/s requires more energy than to keep the water 
flowing at that same velocity. And this extra energy comes from the 
extra 3 ft of elevation difference between the water level in the sump 
and the water level in the lake. Once the water has reached its steady-
state velocity of 8 ft/s, the need for this extra conversion of feet of 
head to acceleration disappears, and the water level in the sump 
rises to within 12 ft of the lake’s level.
34.2  Starting NPSH Requirement
The need to accelerate the fluid in the suction of a pump is called the 
starting net positive suction head (NPSH) requirement. To calculate this 
starting NPSH requirement, let’s ­assume:
• Suction line = 100 ft
• Eight inch suction line
• Fluid = water @ 62 ­lb/ft3
• Initial velocity is 0
• Final velocity is 10 ft/s
Then proceed as ­follows:
• Mass in line is 2170 lb
• Change in momentum in line is 10 ft/s times 2170 lb = 
22,170 ft lb(m)

If the operator increases the flow rate uniformly over a period of

One lb mass equals 1 lb force times s2/ft. Therefore, the force 
needed to accelerate the water in the pump’s suction ­is
222 lb (f)
The area of the 8-inch suction line is 50 in2. Therefore, the starting 
pressure loss ­is
222 lb (f) ÷ 50 inch2 = 4.4 psi
	
or  4.4 psi times 2.31 = 10.1 ft of ­water

34.3  Pressure
34.3.1  Loss of Suction Pressure
The need to accelerate liquid in the suction line of a pump leads to a 
difficult operating problem, which occurs on start-up. Just before the 
pump shown in Fig. 34.5 is put on line, the velocity in the suction line 
is zero. The energy to increase the velocity (i.e., accelerate) the liquid 
in the suction line must come from the pressure of the liquid at the 
pump’s suction. As the pump’s discharge valve is opened, the veloc-
ity in the suction line increases, reducing the pressure at the suction 
of the pump. The faster the discharge valve is opened, the greater the 
acceleration in the suction line, and the greater the loss in the pump’s 
suction pressure.
If the pressure at the suction of the pump falls to its bubble or 
boiling point, the liquid will start to vaporize. This is called cavitation. 
A cavitating pump will have an erratically low discharge pressure 
and an erratically low flow. As shown in Fig. 34.5, the bubble-point 
pressure of the liquid is the pressure in the vessel. We usually assume 
that the liquid in a drum is in equilibrium with the vapor. The vapor 
is then said to be at its dew point, while the liquid is said to be at its 
bubble point.
To avoid pump cavitation on start-up, the experienced opera-
tor opens the pump discharge valve slowly. Slowly opening the 
discharge valve results in reduced acceleration of the liquid in the 
suction line and a slower rate of the conversion of suction pres-
sure to velocity.

Try this test. To illustrate what I have just explained, try this 
experiment:
	
1.	 Open the suction valve to a pump completely.
	
2.	 Crack open the case vent to fill the case with liquid. This is 
called “priming the pump.”
	
3.	 Open the pump discharge valve completely.
	
4.	 Push the motor start button.
	
5.	 Observe the pump suction pressure.
You will see that the pump suction pressure will drop and then 
come partly back up. If the pump suction pressure were 15 psig to start 
with, it might drop to 12 psig and then come up to 14 psig. The perma-
nent difference in the suction pressure between 15 and 14 psig is due to 
a 1-psi piping friction pressure loss. The temporary difference in the 
suction pressure between 14 and 12 psig is due to a 2-psi conversion 
of pressure to velocity or kinetic energy.
To review—all the energy needed to accelerate the liquid to the 
suction of a pump comes from the pump’s suction pressure. None of 
this energy comes from the pump itself. Or, as one clever operator at 
the Unocal Refinery in San Francisco explained to me, “Pumps push, 
but they do not suck.”
34.3.2  Pump Discharge Pressure
Figure 34.6 illustrates the internal components of an “overhung, 
single-stage” centrifugal pump. The term “overhung” refers to the 
feature that the pump has only an inboard, but no outboard, bearing. 
The inboard side of a pump means the end closest to the driver. The 
term “single stage” means that there is only one impeller. Multistage 
pumps can have five or six impellers.
The main components of the pump shown in Fig. 34.6 are
• Shaft—used to spin the impeller
• Coupling—attaches the shaft to the turbine or motor driver
• Bearings—support the shaft
• Seal—prevents the liquid inside the pump from leaking out 
around the shaft
• Impeller wear ring—minimizes internal liquid leakage, from 
the pump discharge, back to the pump suction
• Impeller—accelerates the liquid
• Volute—converts the velocity imparted to the liquid by the 
impeller to feet of head
The impeller is the working part of a centrifugal pump. The 
function of the impeller is to increase the velocity or kinetic energy 

	
C e n t r i f u g a l  P u m p s :  F u n d a m e n t a l s  o f  O p e r a t i o n 	
455
of the liquid. The liquid flows into the impeller and leaves the impel-
ler at the same pressure. The location of the oval dot shown at the 
top of the impeller in Fig. 34.6 is called the “vane tip.” The pressure 
at the vane tip is the same as the pump’s suction pressure. However, 
as the high-velocity liquid escapes from the impeller and flows into 
the volute, its velocity decreases. The volute (which is also called the 
diffuser) is shaped like a cone. It widens out in the manner illustrated 
in Fig. 34.7. As the liquid flows into the wider section of the volute, 
its velocity is reduced, and the lost velocity is converted—well, not 
into pressure, but into feet of head.
34.3.3  Feet of Head
A centrifugal pump develops the same feet of head regardless of the 
density of the liquid pumped, as long as the flow is constant. This 
statement is valid as long as the viscosity of the liquid is below 50 to 
100 cP or 200 to 400 SSU (Saybolt seconds universal). But, as process 
operators or engineers, we are not interested in feet of head. We are 
interested only in pressure. Differential pressure is related to differen-
tial feet of head as follows:

The increase in pressure ∆P is also called head pressure. For 
example, if I have 231 ft of water in the glass cylinder shown in 
Fig. 34.8, it would exert a head pressure of 100 psig on the pressure 
gauge at the bottom of the cylinder. The head pressure would be 
proportionally reduced as the liquid becomes less dense. For 
example, 231 ft of kerosene (which has 0.75 s.g.) would exert a head 
pressure of only 75 psig, because it is lighter than water.
34.3.4  Effect of Specific Gravity
Figure 34.9 shows a centrifugal pump that may pump water through 
valve B or naphtha through valve A.
Question: When water is pumped, the pump’s discharge pressure 
is 110.4 psig. The pump’s suction pressure is 10.4 psig. When naphtha 
is pumped, what is the pump’s discharge pressure?

Next question: The pump is driven by an ordinary alternating-
current electric motor. It is running at 3600 rpm. When we switch from 
pumping water to naphtha, what happens to the speed of the pump?
Answer: Nothing. An AC motor is a fixed-speed machine. It will 
continue to spin at 3600 rpm.
Next question: The pump is pulling 100 amps of electrical power. 
The flow rate is 100 GPM. If we now close valve B and open valve A, 
what happens to the amp load on the motor driver?
Answer: The power demand will go down to 60 amp. Amp(ere)s 
are a form of electrical work. The units of work are foot-pounds. The 
feet of head developed by the pump is not affected by the specific 
gravity of the liquid. But the weight of liquid pumped is proportional 
to the specific gravity. If the specific gravity drops by 40 percent, and 
the liquid volume (GPM) stays constant, then the pounds lifted by 
the pump drops by 40 percent and so does the electrical work.
Last question: Water is being pumped to a tank on a hill at 100 GPM. 
If we now switch to pumping a lighter fluid at the same rate, can we 
pump the lighter fluid to a higher elevation, only to a lower elevation, 
or the same elevation?
Answer: The same elevation. Centrifugal pumps develop the same 
feet of head at a given volumetric flow rate regardless of the specific 
gravity of the liquid pumped. This means the ability of the pump to 
push liquid uphill is the same even if the density of the liquid changes.

34.3.5  Pump Curve
The feet of head developed by a pump is affected by the volume of 
liquid pumped. Figure 34.10 is a typical pump curve. As the flow of 
liquid from a centrifugal pump increases, the feet of head developed 
by the pump goes down, as does the pump discharge pressure.
A pump curve has two general areas. These are the flat portion of 
the curve and the steep portion of the curve. We normally design and 
operate a pump to run toward the far end of the flat portion of its 
curve. A centrifugal pump operating on the flat portion of its curve 
loses only a small portion of its discharge pressure when flow is 
increased. This is a desirable operating characteristic.
A centrifugal pump operating on the steep portion of its curve 
loses a large portion of its discharge pressure when flow is increased.

Pumps operating quite far out on their curve will have an erratic dis-
charge pressure, as the flow through the pump varies. For one such 
pump, I have seen the discharge pressure drop from 210 to 90 psig 
as the flow increased by 40 percent. The flow through this pump was 
regulated by a downstream level-control valve. The discharge pres-
sure varied so erratically that the operators thought the pump was 
cavitating.
34.3.5.1  Deviation from Pump Curve
Pumps always perform on their performance curve. It is just that they 
do not always perform on the manufacturer’s performance curve. 
The dotted line in Fig. 34.10 compares an actual performance curve to 
the manufacturer’s performance curve. Why the deviation?
• The manufacturer’s curve was generated using water. We are 
pumping some other fluid with a much higher viscosity.
• The clearance between the impeller and the impeller wear 
ring (Fig. 34.6) may have increased as a result of wear.
• The impeller itself may be worn, or the vane tips at the edge 
of the impeller might be improperly machined.
• Perhaps the most common reason for the deviation is that the 
clearance between the impeller sides and the vertical sides of 
the pump case have increased, due to erosion of the interior 
of the pump case. This requires that the inside of the pump

case be built up with the weld metal, and then machined back 
to the original manufacturer’s tolerances. This procedure is a 
lot of work and is often neglected by the maintenance depart-
ment, who do not consider this “work” to be part of their job 
description.
• If the pump is driven by a steam turbine, the pump speed 
could be lower than in the design.
• Available NPSH may be marginal (see Chap. 36).
34.3.6  Driver Horsepower
Normally, increasing the flow from a centrifugal pump increases the 
amperage load on the motor driver, as shown in Fig. 34.11. Driver 
horsepower is proportional to GPM times feet of head. As shown in 
Fig. 34.10, as the flow increases, the feet of head developed by the 
pump decreases. On the flat part of the pump curve, the flow increases 
rapidly, while the head slips down slowly. Hence the product of GPM 
times feet of head increase.
On the steep part of the pump curve, the flow increases slowly, 
while the head drops off rapidly. Hence, the product of GPM times 
feet of head remains the same, or goes down.
The response of the amp load on the motor driver is an indication 
of pump performance. A pump operating on the proper, flat portion of 
its curve will pull more motor amps as flow increases. A pump oper-
ating on the poor, steep portion of its curve will not pull more amps.

If the manufacturer’s horsepower/flow curve indicates that more 
horsepower is required as flow is increased, but the motor amp load is 
not increasing, then something is wrong with the pump.
The amp meter for a pump is best located right on the start-stop 
box next to the motor. Unfortunately, more often, the only amp 
meter is located on the electrical breaker box, which is at a remote 
location.
34.4  Pump Impeller
34.4.1  Impeller Diameter
The pump impeller resembles a hollow wheel with radial vanes. The 
diameter of this wheel can be trimmed down on a lathe. If an impeller 
with a 10-inch diameter is trimmed down to 9 inch, it will have a new 
performance curve below its former performance curve. Both the 
flow and head of the pump will be reduced. Also, the amp load on the 
motor driver will decrease. As a rough rule of thumb, reducing a 
pump’s impeller diameter by 10 percent will reduce the amp load by 
25 percent. Not only will this save electricity, but the motor will run 
much cooler. Unloading the motor by 25 percent may increase the life 
of the motor windings by 10 years.
When the control valve downstream of a pump is operating in a 
mostly closed position, the pump is a good candidate to have its 
impeller trimmed. Sometimes, the pressure drop across a control 
valve is so huge (≥100 psi) that it makes a roaring sound. The energy 
represented by this wasteful P is coming from the electricity sup-
plied to the pump’s motor. Hence, trimming the impeller also reduces 
wear because of erosion in downstream control valves.
We frequently increase the size of impellers to increase pump 
capacity and discharge pressure. However, many chemical plants 
break the law when they do so. State boiler codes require that vessels 
and heat exchangers downstream of pumps be rated for the
• Maximum pump discharge pressure
• At the maximum specific gravity that can reasonably be 
expected
• Unless the equipment is protected by a relief valve
Increasing the size of an impeller always increases its maximum 
discharge pressure. Hence, increasing the impeller diameter may 
be unlawful, depending on the maximum allowable working 
pressure (MAWP) of downstream heat exchangers. The MAWP is 
shown on the exchanger nameplate.
Increasing the size of the impeller by 10 percent will increase the 
amperage load on the motor driver by 30 percent. For many process 

	
462	
C h a p t e r  T h i r t y - F o u r
pumps, this would require a new motor and breaker to support the 
larger impeller.
Trimming the pump impeller on a lathe also requires the reshap-
ing of the tips of the impeller vanes. Most often, this requirement is 
ignored, and the revamped pump operates below its expected curve. 
Rather than worry about these fine points, it is best to order new 
impellers directly from the manufacturer.
Installing a larger impeller may require an upgrade in the pump 
bearings and the mechanical seal. While it is good practice to pur-
chase a pump with a seal and bearings rated for the maximum impel-
ler size, some pumps can have bearings and seals rated only for their 
purchased impeller size. For process people, the only practical 
method to check that a pump’s seal and bearings are suitable for the 
larger impeller is to check with the manufacturer. Drilling pressure 
balancing holes in the hub of the impeller helps to reduce the extra 
strain on the bearings of a larger impeller.
Sometimes installing a full-sized impeller causes the pump to 
vibrate. This happens because of a disturbance to the liquid as the 
vanes spin past the volute or diffuser (i.e., the case outlet opening). 
Exxon had, at one time, a standard of keeping impeller sizes at not 
more than 92 percent of the full impeller diameter. This seems a con-
servative practice to me. I have usually kept impeller sizes in my 
revamp designs 0.25 to 0.5 inches below maximum. I don’t recall any 
of my clients complaining that such pumps vibrated as a result of the 
enlarged impeller. On the other hand, for a new installation, now that 
I’ve learned of the Exxon standard, I plan to follow it in my process 
design work.
34.4.2  Impeller Rotation
Motor-driven pumps often are found running backward. If the motor 
is wired up backward (this is called reversing the polarity of the 
leads), the pump will run with the impeller spinning backward. This 
will reduce the pump’s discharge pressure, sometimes by a little 
(10 percent) and sometimes by a lot (90 percent). It depends on the 
design of the impeller. You cannot see the direction of rotation of a 
pump, but if you touch a pencil to the spinning shaft, you can feel the 
direction of rotation. The correct direction of rotation is indicated by 
an arrow stamped on the top of the pump case. There are right- and 
left-handed pumps. So two otherwise identical pumps may have 
opposite directions of rotation.
A pump impeller will spin backward because the motor wiring is 
connected incorrectly. I’m referring to a three-phase motor. For a 
single-phase motor, the wiring connections may be reversed without 
affecting the direction of rotation.
In North America, we use 60 Hertz electric power and motors 
operate at 1800 rpm (single phase) or 3600 rpm (three phase). In Europe 

	
C e n t r i f u g a l  P u m p s :  F u n d a m e n t a l s  o f  O p e r a t i o n 	
463
and Asia, 50 Hertz electric power is the standard; single-phase motors 
spin at 1500 rpm and three-phase motors at 3000 rpm.
I was working on a project to relocate a U.S. process unit to 
Cyprus. The project met a merciful death when I explained that a 
100-horsepower American pump (60 Hertz) would only produce 
58 percent of pumping power when connected to a European 
(50 Hertz) motor. That is:
• (100 hp) (50/60)3 = 58 hp
According to the affinity or fan laws, work or power varies with 
speed, cubed.
It is possible to rewire a three-phase motor into a single-phase 
motor, and thus reduce its speed from 3600 to 1800 rpm. Then its 
power consumption would drop by a factor of 8. I’ve done this once 
at an East Coast refinery, which had a hugely oversized sulfur plant 
incinerator air blower. For most projects, a more typical option would 
be to retrofit the motor for variable-speed operation, using frequency 
control. However, not all motors are amenable to frequency control, 
which is a relatively expensive option. Feedback from my clients that 
have retrofitted pump drivers with variable-speed AC motors is often 
unfavorable.
34.5  Effect of Temperature on Pump Capacity
If we wish to increase the capacity of a centrifugal pump, should we 
make the liquid hotter or colder? Let’s make a few assumptions:
• Cooling the liquid will not increase its viscosity above 30 or 
40 centistokes.
• We are pumping hydrocarbons. Cooling many hydrocarbons 
by 100°F increases their density by 5 percent.
• The pump’s motor is somewhat oversized.
On this basis, cooling the liquid by 100°F will raise the pump’s dis-
charge pressure by 5 percent. If the pump is developing 1000 psig of 
differential pressure, cooling the liquid by 200°F will increase its dis-
charge pressure to 1100 psig. If the discharge control valve is now 
opened, the pump’s discharge pressure will drop back to 1000 psig as 
the flow increases. The discharge pressure drops because the pump 
develops less feet of head at a higher flow rate.
To summarize, the specific gravity of the liquid has increased by 
10 percent. The feet of head of liquid has decreased by 10 percent. Since:
P ≈ (specific gravity) × (feet of head)
P remains constant. But the lower required feet of head permits the 
pump to operate further out on its performance curve. This produces 

	
464	
C h a p t e r  T h i r t y - F o u r
more volumetric (GPM) flow. It also requires more work to pump the 
greater flow. So we have to have sufficient excess amperage on the 
motor driver to accommodate this maneuver. But that is the price we 
pay for expanding the pump’s capacity without increasing the impel-
ler diameter. Of course, the larger-diameter impeller would also 
require more motor amperage.

CHAPTER 35
Centrifugal Pumps: 
Driver Limits
Electric Motors  
and Steam Turbines
There are three types of limits on centrifugal pumps: 
• Impeller limit.  This was the subject of Chap. 34. Sometimes 
this is called a pump limit.
• Driver limit.  This means the electric motor is tripping off on 
high amperage or the turbine is running below its set speed.
• Suction pressure limit.  Usually called lack of net positive suction 
head (NPSH), this is the subject of Chap. 36, which follows.
35.1  Electric Motors
Pumps are driven by either fixed-speed or variable-speed motors. 
Variable-speed motors are becoming increasingly common. Flow 
can be controlled by varying the pump speed with the motor and 
thus eliminating parasitic energy losses across a flow control valve. 
However, because of the extra electronic components needed for a 
variable-speed AC motor, 95 percent of the motors we work with are 
fixed-speed alternating-current motors. I will only discuss fixed-
speed, alternating-current (AC) motors in this chapter.
Direct-current (DC) motors are sometimes used in process plants. 
It is easy to manipulate the speed of a DC motor. But direct current is 
almost never available on a process unit. Our motors at home are 
mainly alternating-current motors operating at a fixed ­speed.
A process motor in an American, Canadian, or Latin American 
plant is likely to run at either 1750 to 1800 rpm or 3500 to 3600 rpm. 
In other locations, a motor will likely run at 1500 or 3000 rpm. 
465

	
466	
C h a p t e r  T h i r t y - F i v e
In the United States, we use alternating current at 60 Hz cycles per 
second. In Europe, they use alternating current at 50 Hz cycles 
per second. As the alternating current cycles 20 percent slower in 
Europe, the motor spins 20 percent slower.
At home, our motors are single phase. At the plant, the motors 
are usually three phase. There is an important difference between 
a single- and a three-phase motor. The three-phase motor can also 
be used as an electric power generator. The single-phase motor we 
use at home, without modification, cannot be used to generate 
electric power. The difference is important in that I once used this 
fact to avoid tripping off a critical process pump, as related in the 
following ­story.
35.1.1  Helper Turbine
Figure 35.1 is a sketch of a centrifugal pump driven by a three-phase 
motor with a turbine helper. This particular pump was charging a 
light gas oil stream to a high-pressure hydrocracker. The pump was 
operating quite close to its design conditions of
• P = 2000 psig
• Flow = 17,000 bbl/day
• Specific gravity = 0.80
• Temperature = 400°F
• Speed = 3600 rpm
The operators were not operating the turbine. The turbine was 
spinning, because it was coupled to the pump, but there was no

motive steam to the turbine. The operators reported that the turbine 
was not needed, as the motor was pulling only 90 percent of its max-
imum amperage load. The question is, dear reader, whether the 
pump will run faster if the motive-steam flow is opened to the tur-
bine. And the answer is no. While the turbine will produce shaft 
work, and will help the motor spin the pump, the pump speed will 
remain unchanged. The extra shaft work from the turbine will just 
reduce the shaft work required from the motor shown in Fig. 35.1. 
The amp(erage) load on the motor will just be reduced.
But suppose the amp load on the motor drops to zero, by gradually 
increasing the steam to the turbine. Then let’s suppose we increase the 
motive steam to the turbine by another notch. Will the pump, the motor, 
and the turbine (which are all coupled together and, hence, must run at 
the same speed) now run faster? The answer is no. But what will hap-
pen to the increment of shaft work generated by the turbine?
This extra shaft work will be converted to electrical power. That 
is, the three-phase motor will turn into an electrical power generator. 
It will begin to export electricity into the grid. A single-phase motor 
does not have this sort of capability.
Another way of expressing this idea is that the three-phase motor 
acts as a brake on the turbine. The motor can run at only 3600 rpm as 
long as it is connected to the electrical grid. The only way we can get 
more flow from this pump without reducing the pump’s P is to raise 
the specific gravity of the liquid being pumped. If the liquid is cooled 
from 400 to 200°F, its specific gravity will increase by about 10 percent. 
This will allow us to get the same P with about 10 percent less feet of 
head. This will allow the pump to run further out on its performance 
curve. The pump will now pump more liquid, and the flow of light gas 
oil to the hydrocracker could be—and was—increased from 17,000 to 
23,000 bbl/day.
Question: How does this affect the amp load on the motor driver? 
Well, the feet of head has gone down by about 10 percent, and the spe-
cific gravity has gone up by about 10 percent. Therefore, the horsepower 
or work per barrel of liquid pumped remains constant. But the number 
of barrels has increased by 6000 bbl/day, or 35 percent. Then the amp 
load on the motor driver would also increase by 35 percent. If I had not 
remembered this prior to cooling the hydrocracker feed, the motor 
would have tripped off. As it was, I had the steam to the turbine increased 
so as to decrease the motor amps to 60 percent of maximum before cool-
ing the gas oil. Omission of this detail would have had embarrassing and 
possibly negative contractual consequences.
35.1.2  Selecting Motor Size
We noted in Chap. 34 that increasing the impeller diameter might 
require a larger motor for an existing pump. Suppose, then, when a 
new pump is purchased, we install a 100-hp motor sized for the 

	
468	
C h a p t e r  T h i r t y - F i v e
maximum 10-inch impeller, which the pump could accommodate. 
Actually, only an 8.5-inch impeller would be used in the pump ini-
tially. This 8.5-inch impeller requires only a 60-hp motor. If we install 
a 100-hp motor, what percent of the electrical power of the oversized 
motor is wasted?
Essentially, none. The amp load on the motor driver is deter-
mined by the work done by the pump, not by the size of the motor. 
The amp load required by the motor is proportional to
	
(Pump head)
(specific gravity)
(liquid flow)
(Motor efficiency)

There will be a small loss of 3 percent in motor efficiency by 
using an oversized motor. As process operators and engineers, we 
can ignore this effect. It is good engineering practice to purchase 
new motors for the maximum-size impeller that can be installed in 
a pump.
35.1.3  Motor Trip Point
Factors that increase the amp load on a pump’s motor driver are
• Increasing the flow, provided the pump is running on the flat 
portion of its curve.
• Increasing the specific gravity of the liquid pumped.
• Increasing the impeller size. A 10 percent increase in impeller 
size may increase the motor amp load by 33 percent.
• Motor winding deterioration, which happens as the motor 
ages, depending on how hot the motor runs.
• Dirt buildup on the motor’s cooling-air fan guard screen.
Most operators forget to clean this screen. The dirty screen then restricts 
air flow to the motor, which then runs hotter. A hotter motor will pull 
more amps. I recently reduced the amp load on a motor by 3 percent by 
cleaning a badly fouled screen.
The amp meter on the motor breaker indicates the amps being 
pulled by the motor. Next to this meter should be a tag or a pen-
ciled number indicating the full-limit amp (FLA) point for the 
motor. Above the FLA point, the motor should trip off. Operating 
the motor substantially above its FLA point will burn up the 
motor’s windings.
This is not quite true. Whenever we start a pump, the starting 
torque required to get the pump spinning requires a surge of motor 
amps. To avoid tripping off the motor on high amps, there is a time 
delay built into the trip mechanism. This delay permits the amperage 
load to greatly exceed the FLA point for up to 15 to 30 seconds. This 
is too brief a period in which to overheat the motor.

	
C e n t r i f u g a l  P u m p s :  D r i v e r  L i m i t s 	
469
If we cannot open the discharge control valve of a centrifugal 
pump 100 percent before the FLA point is reached, then we say that 
the pump is driver-limited. This is a frustrating problem for plant 
operators, and clearly reflects poor design practice in undersizing the 
motor driver horsepower.
35.1.4  Internal Motor Thermal ­Protection
I have made the statement earlier in this chapter that alternating-
current motors operate at a constant speed. I wrote this because I’ve 
read it in a book. Yet, I know from personal experience that this is 
wrong. I know that my wood-turning lathe will slow down if I press 
too hard on the spinning wood with my cutting chisel. The lathe is 
run by a 1750-rpm, 60-Hz, 120-V, 3/4-hp AC motor. But I also know 
that if I run the motor at a slower speed for a minute or two, the 
motor will get hot and trip off on its internal thermal trip switch. I 
will then have to wait 10 minutes for the motor to cool off before I 
hear the click of the trip ­resetting.
The motor has gotten hot because an alternating-current motor 
efficiency goes down a lot when it runs below its rated speed. That is, 
running an alternating-current motor slow increases the motor amper-
age requirement. The extra amperage goes to heat and not to increased 
motor work ­output.
At the plant, our motors are protected differently than at home. 
At home, our motors share a circuit with other power consumers. 
A circuit breaker may be rated for 20 amps, but a single motor on 
that circuit may be rated for 5 amps. The circuit breaker setting of 
20 amps is too large to protect the motor from overheating. At the 
plant, each motor has its own dedicated circuit breaker, set indi-
vidually to protect a particular motor from overheating (i.e., the 
full-limit amperage point). If the load on the motor increases too 
much because the specific gravity of the fluid pump has increased, 
the motor may indeed momentarily slow down. But due to the 
lower efficiency at the slower speed, the amperage load will 
increase rapidly as the alternating-current motor slows. The FLA 
point on the circuit breaker in the breaker or switchgear house for 
that motor will be exceeded and the motor will trip ­off.
To summarize, at home, motors can run slower for a minute or 
two before they trip off on high winding temperature. At work, 
motors trip off at the breaker after a few seconds of running slow due 
to the high amperage load exceeding the breaker full-limit amperage 
setting of the ­breaker.
35.1.5  Motor Bearings
If you think a motor is running rough because of bad bearings, have it 
uncoupled from the pump. Run the motor alone, and see if the vibrations 
persist. Motor bearings commonly fail because of a lack of lubrication. 

	
470	
C h a p t e r  T h i r t y - F i v e
Most motors are lubricated with a heavy grease injected through a 
grease fitting delivered via a grease gun. Overgreasing can burn up the 
motor bearings. You need to follow the manufacturer’s recommenda-
tions. A typical (but not general) program for motor bearing lubrication 
is three or four squirts from a grease gun every six months. There is a 
device now available on the market called a “bearing buddy,” which 
delivers a consistent grease supply pressure over an extended period 
of time. Motor bearing failures on one process facility disappeared 
when these bearing buddies were installed.
35.2  Steam Turbines
35.2.1  Turbine Drives
A turbine-driven pump is said to be driver-limited when the gover-
nor speed-control valve is wide open. This speed-control valve is 
usually called the “Woodward governor.” It is not that easy to see if 
the governor is really wide open. A few simple methods to make this 
determination are
• Increase the pump’s flow. If the turbine slows, the governor is 
wide open.
• Increase the set-point speed. If the turbine speed fails to come 
up, the governor was already wide open.
• Throttle on the steam supply to the governor. If the governor 
is already wide open, the turbine will slow down.
Even if the governor-steam inlet control valve is 100 percent open, it 
may still be possible to increase the supply of motive steam into the tur-
bine. The position of the governor when it is wide open can often be reset 
to admit more steam flow. I once increased the flow through a crude 
tower-bottom pump by pushing hard against the base of the governor, 
and forced it to actually open to its maximum position. The pump speed 
came up 300 rpm, and the flow increased by about 15 percent.
Another possibility is to open the speed or hand valves, as 
described in Chap. 24, “Steam Turbines.” This will introduce more 
steam into the turbine case and slightly lower the pressure in the 
steam chest. Even though the governor-steam speed-control valve is 
wide open, the reduction in downstream pressure in the steam chest 
will increase the steam flow into the turbine.
Of course, increasing the motive-steam pressure will greatly 
increase the horsepower available to the turbine. First, more work 
can be extracted from each pound of the motive steam; and second, 
increasing the steam pressure will increase the pounds of steam flow-
ing through the governor.

	
C e n t r i f u g a l  P u m p s :  D r i v e r  L i m i t s 	
471
Reducing the turbine exhaust pressure will not significantly 
increase the steam flow to the turbine. However, reducing the turbine 
exhaust-steam pressure will increase the amount of work that may be 
extracted from each pound of steam. For example, 150-psig, 400°F 
steam is being used to drive a turbine. The exhaust steam is flowing 
into a 15-psig steam header. By venting the steam to the atmosphere, 
the amount of work that can be extracted from each pound of steam 
will increase by roughly 30 percent (see the Mollier diagram).
35.2.2  Increasing the Size of Steam Nozzles
Many steam turbines do not have full-ported steam nozzles (see 
Chap. 24). The existing steam nozzles may then be exchanged for 
larger nozzles. An increase of nozzle diameter of 10 percent would 
increase the turbine horsepower by 20 percent.
Finally, the steam turbine’s buckets can foul with hardness 
deposits from the steam. This reduces the turbine efficiency and may 
prevent a pump from running at its rated speed. Injecting steam con-
densate into the steam supply can remove such deposits.
It is quite important not to operate a turbine-driven pump by 
manually throttling the steam flow to the turbine. Let’s assume that 
the operators have set the turbine speed at 3500 rpm by adjusting the 
steam inlet gate valve upstream of a malfunctioning governor. Sud-
denly, the discharge flow-control valve cuts back, and the pump’s 
flow decreases from 2000 to 1200 GPM. The pump speed will then 
increase, because fewer pounds of liquid are being pumped and less 
horsepower is required to spin the pump.
The pump speed rises to 3800 rpm. The trip speed has been set at 
3750 rpm. The turbine’s overspeed trip is unlatched, and the machine 
shuts down. The operator relatches the trip, but every time the flow 
is throttled back, the turbine overspeeds, and trips off.
Finally, the operator, in frustration, decides to wire up the trip so 
that it cannot unlatch. As an operator in a Gulf Coast refinery stated, 
“Norm, when the governor won’t work on a turbine, it is necessary to 
wire up the trip.” I thought he was joking, but he could not have been 
more serious.
Well, the operator did have a pump with an inoperable governor 
speed-control valve. He did wire the trip open. A few days later, the 
pump briefly lost suction, due to a slightly low level in the flash drum 
feeding the pump. The pump cavitated, and the flow was reduced. 
Reducing the flow to or from a centrifugal pump reduces the horse-
power load on the driver. As the steam flow to the turbine driver was 
fixed, the turbine started to overspeed. The excessive speed damaged 
the pump’s bearing. The resulting vibration fractured the seal flush 
oil line to the pump. The flush oil ignited on the 700°F pump case. 
A nearby worker was sprayed with the burning oil and killed! This is 
a true story.

35.3  Gears
On occasion, pumps are not directly connected to either a motor or a 
turbine. There is an intervening gear, which can increase the pump’s 
speed by multiplying the driver’s speed. The gear is another source of 
possible misalignment and vibration. I have always considered such 
reduction or speed increaser gears to represent poor design practice, 
and an unnecessary complication as they often require their own 
lubrication system. Most often the lube oil pump is driven indirectly 
by the main pump. Especially for a turbine-driven pump, this is a 
recipe for disaster.
It’s true that the primary lube oil pump is typically backed up by 
a separate, spare lube oil pump driven by an external power source. 
However, only too often that backup pump, which is rarely used, 
fails to start up automatically due to lack of routine testing, and the 
gears are destroyed.1

Cavitation and Net 
Positive Suction Head
T
he single most common operational problem in a process plant 
is loss of suction pressure to a centrifugal pump. If the suction 
pressure is too low, the discharge pressure and the discharge 
flow become erratically low. The suction pressure, while low, remains 
comparatively steady.
36.1  Cavitation and Net Positive Suction Head
The problem described above is called cavitation. A pump that is 
operating in a cavitation mode may also (but often does not) produce 
a sound similar to shaking a bucket full of nuts and bolts. A cavitating 
motor-driven pump always draws an erratically low-amperage flow. 
This is consistent with the erratically low flow rate.
(Caution: When a pump completely loses flow, it runs smooth, steady, 
and quiet. Its discharge pressure is stable. Its discharge flow is also stable 
and steady—a steady zero. This is not cavitation. The pump impeller is 
just spinning, to no particular purpose, in the empty impeller case.)
36.1.1  Causes of Cavitation
Let us assume liquid flows from an 8-inch line into the suction of a 
centrifugal pump. The liquid enters the pump’s impeller through a 
circular opening, called the “eye of the impeller,” in the center of the 
impeller. Let us assume that this eye has a diameter of 2 inches.

The velocity of the liquid increases by a factor of 16 (i.e., 8 inch ÷ 
2 inch, squared). The kinetic energy of the liquid increases by a factor 
of 264 (i.e., 16 squared). But where does this large increase in kinetic 
energy come from? Answer—from the pressure, or feet of head, of the 
liquid itself.
The conversion of the pump’s suction pressure to velocity in 
the eye of the impeller is called the required net positive suction head 
(NPSH). As the flow-control valve on the discharge of the pump 
shown in Fig. 36.1 is opened, the velocity of liquid in the eye of the 
impeller goes up. More of the pump’s suction pressure, or feet of 
head, is converted to velocity, or kinetic energy. This means that the 
required NPSH of a pump increases as the volumetric flow through 
the pump increases.
The units of NPSH are feet of liquid head. The required NPSH of 
a pump is due primarily to the conversion of feet of head to velocity 
in the eye of the impeller.
The available NPSH to a pump has the following definition:

To express the available NPSH in feet:
•	 Measure the pump suction pressure, and add the barometric 
pressure (14.67 psia at sea level).
•	 Look up, on a vapor pressure chart, the vapor pressure of the 
liquid pumped, at the measured pump suction temperature, 
in psia.
•	 Multiply the difference between the two above pressures by 
2.31 ft (for water).
•	 Divide by the specific gravity at flowing conditions of the liq-
uid (1.00 for water, 0.85 for diesel, 0.50 for propane) at the 
pump suction temperature.
Note that the pump suction pressure is the pressure downstream 
of the pump’s suction screen, and not a pressure read from a control 
panel screen.
When the required NPSH of a pump equals the NPSH available 
to the pump, the pump will cavitate or slip.
36.1.2  Cavitation Illustrated
Let us see what cavitation means in reference to the pump shown in  
Fig. 36.1. The liquid shown in the vessel is presumed to be in equilib-
rium with the vapor leaving the drum. This means that the liquid is at 
its bubble-point pressure and the vapor is at its dew-point temperature.
The vapor pressure of the liquid is then 24.7 psia (10 psig plus 
14.7 psia of atmospheric pressure). The physical pressure at the suction 
of the pump is measured at 29.7 psia (15 psig plus 14.7 psia of atmo-
spheric pressure).
Then the physical pressure at the suction of the pump of 29.7 psia 
minus the vapor pressure of the liquid at the suction of the pump of 
24.7 psia is 5 psia. This will be the NPSH available to the pump after 
we convert from psia to feet of liquid head.
The specific gravity of the liquid being pumped, as shown in 
Fig. 36.1, is 0.58 s.g. To convert from psia to feet of liquid head, we have
5 psia

20 ft of head
×
=
The 20 ft matches the level of liquid in the drum above the suction 
line of the pump, shown in Fig. 36.1, and equals the available NPSH 
to the pump.
The required NPSH of the pump may be read from Fig. 36.2 
(regardless of the s.g. of the liquid being pumped). It shows that at 
250 GPM, the required NPSH of 20 ft will equal the available NPSH 
of 20 ft. Therefore, at a flow rate of 250 GPM, the pump will cavitate. 
This calculation has neglected frictional losses in the suction line and 
nozzle, which should be subtracted from the available NPSH.

	
476	
C h a p t e r  T h i r t y - S i x
Let’s now assume that we wish to pump 300 GPM, not 250 GPM. 
If we open the flow-control valve shown in Fig. 36.1, the flow will 
momentarily increase. But within a few seconds, the flow will become 
erratically low as the pump begins to cavitate. The problem is that, 
according to Fig. 36.2, we require an additional 6 ft of NPSH to 
increase the flow from 250 to 300 GPM.
One way of getting this extra suction pressure, or NPSH, is to 
raise the liquid level in the drum. For a liquid of 0.58 s.g., with every 
4 ft we raise the level in the drum, the suction pressure will increase 
by 1 psi, and the available NPSH will increase by 4 ft. But, unfortu-
nately, the drum shown in Fig. 36.1 is already almost full.
Suppose we increase the pressure by partly closing the back-
pressure control valve. This will quickly increase the pressure in the 
drum from 10 to 15 psig. The pressure at the suction of the pump will 
also increase, from 15 to 20 psig. However, will this provide more 
NPSH to the pump?
Answer—no! Unfortunately, it is not only the pressure of the 
liquid at the pump that changes. The composition of the liquid will 
also be altered. As the pressure in the drum increases, additional 
lighter components dissolve in the liquid. The composition of the 
liquid then becomes lighter. The vapor pressure of the liquid will 
also increase by 5 psi. This must happen because the liquid in the 
drum, which is in equilibrium with the vapor, is at its bubble-point 
pressure.
Again, the available NPSH is the physical pressure at the suction 
of the pump minus the vapor pressure of the liquid at the suction of 
the pump. If both pressures increase by 5 psi, the net gain in NPSH is 
zero.

Let us try again. Suppose we decrease the temperature of the 
drum, shown in Fig. 36.1, from 140 to 110°F. This will also cool the 
liquid flowing into the suction of the pump by 30°F. Will this colder 
liquid then provide more NPSH to the pump by suppressing the 
flashing of the liquid flowing into the pump’s impeller?
Answer—no! Unfortunately, it is not only the temperature of the 
liquid that changes. The composition of the liquid has also been 
altered. As the temperature in the drum decreases, additional lighter 
components dissolve in the liquid. The composition of the liquid 
becomes lighter. The liquid will now boil, not at 140°F, but at 110°F. 
This must happen because the liquid in the drum, which is in equilib-
rium with the vapor, is at its bubble-point temperature, which is now 
a cooler 110°F.
Let’s try one more time. Suppose we tear off the insulation on the 
suction line and on the pump case and then spray cool water on the 
bare line. The temperature of the liquid in the drum, which is at 140°F, 
cools as it flows into the pump. By the time the liquid reaches the eye 
of impeller, it has cooled to 135°F. Will this slightly colder liquid pro-
vide more NPSH to the pump?
Answer—yes! But why? Well, the liquid is cooled by 5°F after it 
leaves the drum. The cooled liquid is not in equilibrium with the 
vapor in the drum. It has been subcooled by 5°F. This means that the 
bubble-point liquid has been cooled without altering its composition. 
The vapor pressure of the liquid has been reduced. As can be seen in 
Fig. 36.3, subcooling this particular liquid by 5°F reduces its vapor 
pressure by about 2 psi. As the specific gravity of the liquid is 0.58, 
this is equivalent to an increase in the NPSH by 8 ft. Once again, our 
objective is to increase the flow from 250 to 300 GPM. Figure 36.2 tells 
us that the required NPSH increases from 20 to 26 ft. However, when

we subcool the liquid by 5°F, the available NPSH increases from 20 to 
28 ft. As the available NPSH now exceeds the required NPSH by 2 ft, 
the flow can be increased without risk of pump cavitation.
36.1.3  Starting NPSH Requirement
The required NPSH read from the manufacturer’s pump curve is 
called the running NPSH. However, when a pump is put on line, 
there is an additional type of NPSH requirement. This is called the 
starting NPSH. The initial velocity of the liquid in the suction of the 
pump is zero. After the pump is up and running, the velocity of 
the liquid in the suction of the pump might be 6 ft/s. This means 
that the liquid in the suction line has to be accelerated, which 
requires energy. This energy does not come from the pump; it must 
come from the liquid in the suction line itself. The only source of 
energy the liquid has is its pressure. This means that the pressure 
of the liquid is converted into kinetic energy. The kinetic energy 
accelerates the liquid from 0 to 6 ft/s.
This results in a temporary loss of pressure at the suction of the 
pump. This temporary loss of pressure is called the starting NPSH 
requirement. The more quickly the operator opens the discharge valve 
of a pump, the more rapidly the liquid accelerates in the suction line. 
This increases the starting NPSH required.
The longer the suction line and the larger the diameter of the line, 
the more mass has to be accelerated. This also increases the starting 
NPSH required. If the sum of the frictional loss in the suction line 
plus the running NPSH plus the starting NPSH equals the available 
NPSH, then the pump will cavitate on start-up.
The experienced design engineer always allows for the starting 
NPSH requirement when determining the elevation of a vessel. It is 
hard to say whether to allow an extra 2 ft or an extra 10 ft. It depends 
on the size of the suction line, and how careful the operators are likely 
to be when starting the pump. But if the designer forgets this factor, 
then the plant operators are sure to notice the omission when the 
pump slips during start-up (See sec. 34.2 for detailed calculations for 
starting NPSH).
36.1.4  A Hunting Story
Gentle reader, thank you for reading so much of our book. Liz and I 
know you must be tired of all this technology. So let’s change the 
subject. Let’s talk about hunting.
How many of you are hunters? How many of you enjoy killing 
the innocent creatures of the forest? Actually, I used to go hunting 
once a year in Casper, Wyoming. At that time, I was working for 
Amoco Oil. So, once a year at the start of the antelope season, I found 
an excuse to visit Amoco’s refinery in Casper.

	
C e n t r i f u g a l  P u m p s :  S u c t i o n  P r e s s u r e  L i m i t s 	
479
I remember my last visit, in 1980. My excuse to visit the refinery 
that year was to start up the pump shown in Fig. 36.4. This was a new, 
flashed crude-oil pump. It had never been run before. The refinery 
operators reported that the pump always cavitated on start-up. They 
had raised the liquid level in the drum to within a few inches of the 
inlet nozzle. A higher level would cause entrainment of the black crude 
oil into the vapor outlet. The operators had then started the motor driv-
ing the pump. Next they very slowly opened the discharge valve.
Regardless of their efforts, the pump cavitated so badly that it 
could not be put in service. Some pumps are like that. The design 
engineer just never allowed any extra liquid elevation for the starting 
NPSH. But what could I do?
You see, guys, here is the problem. I cannot go hunting until I get 
the pump going. And I do not have much time. My friends are waiting 
for me at the plant gate. They’re waiting in those great big high-wheel 
pickup trucks designed for off-road use. They’re blowing their horns 
and yelling for me to hurry up. It is a macho-type thing!
For my part, I cannot see the rush. I would just as soon stop at the 
gates of the city of Casper, Wyoming, and shoot the first antelope 
we came across. But not my friends. They want to go deep out into 
the back country to search for the “ghost antelope.” And they are in a

big hurry to get started. What, then, can I do to get the flashed crude 
pump up and running in just a few minutes? 
36.1.5  Temporary Increase in NPSH
This pump is presumed to run fine once it is running. The available 
NPSH is such that it exceeds the running NPSH. So how can I pro-
vide a temporary increase in the available NPSH, to satisfy the tem-
porary starting NPSH requirement?
Answer—suddenly increase the pressure in the drum by partly 
closing the back-pressure control valve shown in Fig. 36.4. This will 
instantly increase the pressure at the suction of the pump. It is true, as 
we said before, that raising the pressure in a drum does not increase the 
available NPSH, assuming that the vapor and liquid are at equilib-
rium. The idea of equilibrium assumes that the vapor is at its dew point 
and the liquid is at its bubble point.
As soon as the drum pressure is raised, the vapor composition in 
the drum is altered. The vapor composition becomes lighter. The 
vapor, though, is still at its dew point.
As soon as the drum pressure is raised, the liquid composition in 
the drum is altered. The liquid composition at the vapor-liquid inter-
face becomes lighter. The liquid formed at the vapor-liquid interface 
is still at its bubble point.
When this lighter liquid works its way down to the suction of 
the pump, the beneficial effect achieved by raising the pressure in 
the drum is gone. The available steady-state NPSH will be exactly 
what it was before the drum pressure was raised. But this will take 
time. If the residence time of the liquid in the drum is 10 min, then 
it will take 10 min for the lighter liquid to reach the suction of the 
pump.
During this 10-min interval, the liquid flowing into the pump is 
the older, heavier composition. If I raise the pressure in the drum 
suddenly by 5 psi, this instantly supplies about 20 ft of additional 
available NPSH—but only for a period of less than 10 min. During 
this period, I can crack open the pump discharge valve, push the 
motor start button, and then slowly accelerate the liquid in the suc-
tion line by slowly opening the discharge valve. If I can do all this 
before the lighter liquid—formed at the vapor-liquid interface in the 
drum—reaches the eye of the pump’s impeller, then I can start up 
the pump. Thus, even though we lacked the extra available NPSH to 
satisfy the pump’s starting NPSH requirement, I could still go ante-
lope hunting with my friends.
My pal, “one-shot” Bob Boening, did manage to shoot an antelope 
with a single round. As we approached the dying creature, it stag-
gered to its feet and ran off. Bob and I then spent the rest of the day 
crawling and clambering through the ravines and rocky hills south of 
Casper, searching for what did prove to be a “ghost antelope.”

36.1.6  Why Some Pumps Cavitate
Pumps cavitate for three reasons:
• They lack sufficient available NPSH to satisfy the conversion 
of pressure to velocity in the eye of the impeller (running 
NPSH).
• They lack sufficient available NPSH to satisfy the conversion 
of pressure to acceleration in the suction line as the pump is 
started (starting NPSH).
• They lack sufficient available NPSH to overcome the fric-
tional losses in the suction piping and the drain or draw 
nozzle.
It is positively my experience that the most common reason for 
pumps’ cavitation is partial plugging of draw nozzles. This problem 
is illustrated in Fig. 36.5. This is the side draw-off from a fractionator. 
Slowly opening the pump’s discharge control valve increases flow up 
to a point. Beyond this point, the pump’s discharge pressure and dis-
charge flow become erratically low. It is obvious, then, that the pump 
is cavitating.

The fluid being pumped is hot water. At the desired flow rate of 
110 GPM, the manufacturer’s pump curve shows that the pump 
requires 14 ft of NPSH. The elevation difference between the draw-
off nozzle and the suction of the pump is shown on Fig. 36.5 as 46 ft. 
We really ought to have plenty of running NPSH. But apparently, we 
do not.
If I reduce the flow of water by just 10 percent down to 100 GPM, 
the cavitation stops. I now put a pressure gauge on the suction of the 
pump. Assuming that the suction line is full of 46 ft of water, what 
suction pressure would I expect? Answer:
	
46 ft
2.3 ft/psi
30 psig
50 psig
+
=
	
The 2.3 ft/psi factor assumes that the specific gravity of water is 1.00.
But the observed pressure is not 50 psig. It is only 47 psig. I am 
missing 3 psig or 7 ft of liquid:
(50 psig - 47 psig) × 2.3 ft/psi = 7 ft
The most likely explanation for this head loss of 7 ft is frictional 
loss in the suction line. This reduces the available NPSH from 46 to 
39 ft. But this is still a lot more available NPSH than the 14 ft of 
required NPSH needed to pump 110 GPM.
If I now open the discharge flow-control valve sufficient to 
increase the flow from 100 to 110 GPM, or by 10 percent, this would 
increase the frictional loss in the suction piping by about 21 percent, 
or about 0.5 psi; P varies with (flow)2.
But this is not what I observe. The suction pressure in Fig. 36.5 
slips from 47 to 36 psig. At which point the pump begins to cavitate. 
What is happening? How could just a 10 percent increase in flow 
cause such a large increase in the suction line delta P? What has hap-
pened to the lost 11 psi (i.e., 47 psig minus 36 psig) of suction pressure?
The boiling-point pressure of the water is equal to 30 psig (the 
pressure in the tower shown in Fig. 36.5); that is, we can assume that 
the water draw-off is at its bubble-point pressure. At 36-psig pump 
suction pressure, the available NPSH is then
(36 psig - 30 psig) × 2.3 = 14 ft
This matches the required NPSH at a flow of 110 GPM, so the 
pump cavitates. But it still seems as if I am missing at least half of the 
46 ft of liquid head to the pump. Where is it?
Well, dear reader, it no longer exists. Figure 36.6 illustrates the 
true situation. Let’s say we are pumping 110 GPM from the pump 
discharge. But only 109 GPM can drain through the draw-off nozzle. 
We would then slowly lower the water level in the suction line. The water 
level would creep down, as would the pump’s suction pressure. 
When the water level in the suction line dropped to 14 ft, the pump 

	
C e n t r i f u g a l  P u m p s :  S u c t i o n  P r e s s u r e  L i m i t s 	
483
would cavitate or slip. The flow rate from the pump would drop, and 
the water level in the suction line to the pump would partially refill. 
The pump’s NPSH requirement would then be temporarily satisfied. 
Normal pump operation would be restored—but only for a moment.
Of course, it may simply be that the draw-off nozzle is under-
sized. To determine whether this is the case, calculate the velocity (in 
feet per second) V through the nozzle:
H = 0.34(V)2
where H is the hydraulic head in inches of liquid required to push 
110 GPM of liquid through the draw-off nozzle. In this case, H is 
found to be 9 inch of water. Apparently, there is twice as much pres-
sure loss through the nozzle than there should be. This indicates that 
the draw-off nozzle must be partly plugged.

The 0.34 coefficient shown is the conversion of potential energy to 
acceleration, which includes a reasonable allowance for turbulence 
and friction. The theoretical coefficient is about 0.18, which only 
includes acceleration. In my designs, I use 0.34 for nozzle exit losses, 
which my experience has shown represents what I actually observe 
in the field, plus a small safety factor.
36.1.7  Vortex Breaker
Many draw-off nozzles, especially those in the bottom of vessels, 
plug because of the presence of vortex breakers. Many designers rou-
tinely add complex vortex breakers to prevent cavitation in pumps. 
But vortex breakers are needed only in nozzles operating with high 
velocities and low liquid levels. Corrosion products, debris, and 
products of chemical degradation can more easily foul and restrict 
nozzles equipped with vortex breakers.
Lack of available NPSH may also be caused by high frictional loss 
in the suction piping. If this is the case, a small reduction in flow will 
not noticeably increase the pressure at the suction of the pump. 
A properly designed suction line to a centrifugal pump should have 
a frictional head loss of only a few feet of liquid. However, having a 
large-diameter suction line and a relatively small draw-off nozzle 
usually will lead to excessive loss of available NPSH.
36.1.8  Marginal Cavitation
On many occasions, I’ve noticed that large, high head pumps with 
a low suction pressure do not cavitate in the normal way. They do 
not develop an erratic discharge pressure and an erratic flow. When 
these pumps are marginally short of NPSH, both flow and dis-
charge pressure remain steady. What does happen is that the pump 
discharge pressure falls by 50 percent (100 to 150 psi). That is, a 
reduction in pump suction pressure of 1 psi causes a fall in pump 
discharge pressure of 100 psi.
Raising the level in the vessel from which the pump is taking flow by 
just 2 ft dramatically increases the pump’s discharge pressure. It seems 
as if the pump’s performance jumps from an inferior performance curve 
to its normal performance curve (see Fig. 34.10). I learned all about this 
subject on a freezing, windy, and damp day in Holland. My client had 
thought that something was wrong with their pump, but it was really 
just a minor liquid level recalibration problem.
36.2  Sub-atmospheric Suction Pressure
36.2.1  Pump Suction under Vacuum
Liquids in storage tanks are almost always subcooled. This is so because 
otherwise the ambient vapor losses from the tank’s vent would be exces-
sive. This creates the potential for a negative pump suction pressure.

	
C e n t r i f u g a l  P u m p s :  S u c t i o n  P r e s s u r e  L i m i t s 	
485
For example, the pump shown in Fig. 36.7 is suffering from a par-
tially plugged in-line suction filter. The positive pressure to the filter of 
5 psig is due to the 15-ft head of liquid in the tank. The filter P is 
12 psi. Hence, the pressure at the suction of the pump is -7 psig. Since 
atmospheric pressure happens to be 15 psia on this particular day, the 
pressure at the suction of the pump is 8 psia.
The liquid being pumped is methanol, which has a vapor pres-
sure, at the pumping temperature of 100°F, of 3 psi. The physical 
pressure at the suction of the pump (8 psia) minus the vapor pressure 
of the liquid at the suction of the pump (3 psi) equals 5 psi. To convert 
the 5 psi to feet of head:
	
(5 psi)
(2.3)
0.77(s.g.)
15 ft
×
=
	
The 0.77 is the density of methanol. The 15 ft of head is the available 
NPSH to this pump. Does this mean that pumps may have a substan-
tial amount of available NPSH even when their suction pressure is 
under a partial vacuum? Yes, if we are pumping a subcooled liquid. 
But this is quite common, because the liquid stored in an ordinary 
atmospheric-pressure storage tank is almost always well below its 
boiling point—that is, the liquid is subcooled.
36.2.2  Sump Pumps
The most common pump used is the sump pump shown in Fig. 36.8. 
The vast majority of the pumps in the world are of this type. They are the 
sort of pumps used to pump water out of shallow wells and from irriga-
tion ditches. In New Orleans, we use thousands of these pumps to push 
rainwater over the levees and into the mighty Mississippi River.
Sump pumps can draw water up from levels as much as 30 ft below 
the pump’s suction. But do such pumps require NPSH? Absolutely! All 
centrifugal pumps have some NPSH requirements. What, then, is the 
available NPSH to the sump pump shown in Fig. 36.8?
The physical pressure at the suction of the pump is the pressure 
at point A. The pump was lifting water from an oily-water sump.

C h a p t e r  T h i r t y - S i x
The water level in the sump was 9 ft below the center line of the 
pump’s inlet. Nine feet of water is equal to 4 psi (i.e., 9 ÷ 2.31). This 
means that the pressure at point A was -4 psig.
Atmospheric pressure on this particular day was 14 psia. The 
absolute pressure at the suction of the pump was then
14 psia - 4 psi = 10 psia
The vapor pressure of water at the 140°F pumping temperature is 
3 psia. The suction pressure at the pump minus the vapor pressure of 
water at the suction of the pump is then 7 psi (i.e., 10 psia minus 3 psi).
The suction line itself was a rather rough, old cast-iron pipe, 
with a frictional loss of 2 psi. This frictional loss must be sub-
tracted from the 7 psi just calculated. This leaves 5 psi available for 
us to convert to feet:
(5 psi) × (2.31 ft/psi) = 11.5 ft
This 11.5 ft is the NPSH available to the pump. The pump itself 
requires only 6 ft of NPSH to pump 1200 GPM of water. Hence, even 
though the pump’s suction is 9 ft above the water in the sump, the 
available NPSH is twice the required NPSH.

pressures are high), can lift water to its suction by perhaps 30 ft. The 
pump shown in Fig. 36.8 can lift 1200 GPM of water by only 15 ft. 
When the water level in the sump drops to 15 ft below the center line 
of the pump’s impeller, the pump will cavitate.
Where, then, does the available NPSH to a sump pump really 
come from? It comes from atmospheric pressure. Atmospheric pres-
sure at sea level is equivalent to
(14.7 psia) × (2.31 ft of water/psi) = 34 ft of water
In theory, this is the greatest height that water can be lifted from a 
well by a surface pump. In practice, this maximum lift height is 25 to 
30 ft. Of course, water is pumped from bore-hole wells hundreds of 
feet deep. But this is done by submersible pumps, which are let down 
into the well.
36.2.3  Loss of Prime
The only real difference between a sump pump and an ordinary cen-
trifugal pump is that the sump pump is more difficult to prime than 
the ordinary pump.
To prime an ordinary pump, we simply crack open the vent valve 
on top of the pump’s case. The pressure of the liquid in the suction 
line pushes out the gas or air trapped in the pump case to the atmo-
sphere or to the plant’s flare line header. Once the pump case is full of 
liquid, it is primed and ready to go.
The problem with priming the pump shown in Fig. 36.8 is that the 
water needed to fill the pump’s case (i.e., to prime the pump) is below 
the pump itself.
Certainly, there are self-priming pumps. These pumps are 
designed to compress very, very small volumes of air, and to produce 
very, very small discharge pressures with the air. The circulation 
pump on my swimming pool is of this type. After running 15 min or 
so, it draws through itself a few cubic feet of air before it can pick up 
suction. Most high-head, large-volume pumps must be primed with 
an external source of water. In Fig. 36.8, this is done by connecting a 
water hose to valve A and opening valve B. Air is pushed out of the 
pump case by the pressure of water in the hose.
When the pump is in operation, the suction pressure of the pump 
is -4 psig. This negative pressure creates a potential problem. Air may 
be drawn into the suction of the pump through leaks in the suction 
line. One especially vulnerable area is the packing gland around the 
valve stem of the pump’s suction valve. Another potential area of air 
in-leakage is around the pump’s mechanical seal. Air drawn into either 
area will cause the pump to cavitate and lose its prime. The flow 
through the pump will then be lost. Playing a water hose over a leaking 
valve stem packing gland or over a bad seal can temporarily restore the 
pump to normal operation. Even better, spread grease on the leaking 
valve stem.

36.2.4  Self-Flushed Pumps
The pump shown in Fig. 36.8 is an illustration of an installation in 
Port Arthur, Texas. The difficulty with this pump was that it would 
lose its prime after being shut down for just a few moments. What is 
the problem?
Answer—there is an error in the design of this pump. The error is 
that this is a self-flushed pump. The mechanical seals on centrifugal 
pumps require a lubricant or seal flush material to keep the seal faces 
from touching and rubbing. In most pumps, this seal flush fluid 
comes from the discharge of the pump itself. Such pumps are called 
self-flushed pumps.
When a self-flushed pump is running, the space between the seal 
faces is filled with the seal flush fluid. When the pump is shut down, 
the space between the seal faces is filled with the fluid in the suction 
of the pump. However, if the pressure at the suction of the pump is 
below atmospheric pressure, then air is drawn through the seal faces 
and into the suction of the pump. This air displaces the water in the 
pump’s case and, with time, causes the pump to lose its prime.
To fix this problem in Port Arthur, I connected an external source 
of seal flush water to the pump, from a nearby washwater station. 
Pumps that have sub-atmospheric suction pressures, and that are 
not in continuous service, should not be self-flushed pumps. They 
should have an external source of seal flush material connected to the 
mechanical seal.
With the external source of seal flush, the pump no longer lost its 
prime when shut down. However, I then noticed an interesting phe-
nomenon. The pump would continue to run for about an hour after it 
stopped raining. It produced a discharge pressure of about 100 psig. 
Then, quite suddenly, the discharge pressure would drop to 70 psig 
and the amp load on the motor driver would slip from 20 to 14 amps 
for its last few minutes of operation.
The cause of this odd behavior is that the water level in the sump 
had dropped. A layer of oil with a specific gravity of 0.70 had been drawn 
into the suction of the pump. The feet of head developed by the pump 
had not changed. But a pump’s discharge pressure is proportional to
P  (density) × (feet of head)
As the specific gravity of the oil had dropped by 30 percent, so 
had the pump discharge pressure. The amperage load on the motor 
driver is also proportional to the weight of liquid pumped, which 
also changes with the specific gravity of the liquid.

Chapter 37
Centrifugal Pumps: 
Reducing Seal and 
Bearing Failures
T
he mechanical seal of a centrifugal pump in hydrocarbon service is 
the weak point for any process unit. In 1974, when I was the oper-
ating superintendent of the Amoco Oil Sulfuric Acid Alkylation 
Plant in Texas City, I discovered two truths about refinery operations:
	
1.	 I hated being an operating supervisor.
	
2.	 Half of my time was devoted to the repair and replacement of 
pump mechanical seals.
I authorized so much overtime for seal maintenance that our lead 
machinist purchased a new fishing boat with his extra pay. In 2013, 
mechanical seals are far more costly and complex, but no more 
mechanically reliable than in 1974. Their reliability is not a matter of 
their design, but of the operator’s ability to operate, and most espe-
cially, to properly start up a pump. A seal may cost $30,000 to $40,000 
to repair. Damage to such a seal is cumulative. Meaning improper 
start-up or operations may not suddenly cause the seal to fail, but 
will certainly hasten the time when it will fail.
A seal should maintain its integrity for six years, provided it is 
operating correctly. Most often seal life is compromised by improper 
start-up procedures. For example, starting up a pump without vent-
ing the seal flush lines to the inner seal on a self-flushed pump may 
reduce the operational seal life by six months, even though the seal 
faces have run dry for only a few seconds. 
37.1  A Packed Pump
Centrifugal pumps were used in the 1880s. I have in my hands Pumps 
and Pumping by M. Powis Bale, published in 1889, which describes 
centrifugal pumps. A far more timely text, which I prefer because it 
489

	
490	
C h a p t e r  T h i r t y - S e v e n
has easy to understand sketches, is Centrifugal Pumps by I. Karassik 
and Roy Carter, 1960.
The 1889 text does not mention mechanical seals, as they did not 
exist then. These early centrifugal pumps were packed pumps. My 
old shift foreman, Henry Ziprean, showed me how to replace the 
packing for a sour water pump during the long strike in 1974 in Texas 
City. I have only done this twice, 39 years ago. But, since I did it with 
my own hands, I’ve never forgotten the details.
As old Zip explained, “Mr. Norm, the purpose of the packing is 
to keep the liquid in the pump case from squirting out along the 
shaft. The packing is this square-shaped asbestos rope. Look here. I 
cut the rope into seven lengths. Each piece is just a bit shorter than 
the circumference of the shaft. I’ll wrap each piece around the 
shaft.”
“But Zip, it seems like the liquid in the pump case could squirt 
out through that gap between the ends of the rope.”
“No, Mr. Norm. See how I placed the rope rings around the shaft? 
I offset those gaps by like 45°, so that the gaps don’t line up. Then I’ll 
push the rings into that cavity at the in-board [i.e., the side of the 
pump nearest the driver]. See how I’m stuffing the rings into the 
round cavity?”
“What’s the cavity called, Zip? Does it have a name?” I asked.
“It’s just called the stuffin’ box, I reckon. Never heard no other. 
Next,” Zip continued, “we gotta push the rings tight together inside 
the stuffin’ box. That’s done with this here lantern ring follower [lan-
tern gland]. We tighten it up to press those seven rings of rope right 
up tight together.”1
“Zip, I don’t think you got that lantern ring follower particularly 
tight. Maybe you should just pull up on those gland studs a bit more.”
Old Zip smiled and said, “Nope. That ain’t right. I’ll just show 
you, Mr. Norm.”
Zip switched on the pump’s motor and studied the stuffing box. 
“It’s not leaking enough. If it don’t leak some, it means those 
rings are packed too tight. Too much friction of the packing rings 
pressing on the spinning shaft. Packing will overheat. Wastes power 
and damages the shaft and packing. Also, need some leakage to keep 
that packing lubricated. See, I’ll just back off some on the gland studs. 
Let a bit more water leak out. That looks just about right now. You can 
do the next one, Mr. Norm. It’s that old cooling water pump on No. 1 
Alky. I’ll watch and you do it.”
37.2  Mechanical Seal
“Zip,” I asked over dinner that evening, “seems like those packing 
rings have to leak to cool and lubricate the inside of the stuffing box. 
Fine for water or even cold diesel. But not so good for butane or 
gasoline.”

	
C e n t r i f u g a l  P u m p s :  R e d u c i n g  S e a l  a n d  B e a r i n g  F a i l u r e s 	
491
“Yep. Packed pumps have their limits. Not any good when pump-
ing stuff that don’t lubricate—like propane and butane and such. 
Not too safe if stuff that leaks out can catch fire easy like gasoline. Or 
is bad to breathe [i.e., carcinogenic] like benzene or rich amine with 
H2S. Or can set up like wax. Then we gotta use a mechanical seal.”
“How does that work?” I asked.
“Well,” Zip answered, “those mechanical seals, they have two 
faces. They’re made in the shape of rings. One ring is soft. It’s made 
of carbon. The other ring is hard. It’s made of tungsten-carbide. One 
ring is stationary. It’s fixed into position on the pump case itself. It’s 
kinda part of the pump case. The other ring rotates with the shaft and 
the impeller. It’s kinda part of the pump’s rotating assembly. 
Mr. Norm, those two rings or seal faces are pressed together by a 
strong spring, called the bellows.”
“I guess, Zip, the bellows are like the lantern ring follower we 
adjusted with the packed pump. Adjusts the pressure on the seal 
faces.”
“That’s right, Mr. Norm. Same idea. Where these faces run past 
each other, that’s the seal. Keeps the liquid in the pump case from 
running out along the shaft and escaping out into the air.”
37.3  Purpose of Seal Flush
Old Zip was a drunk. He kept a bottle of Scotch in his locker. Zip came 
to work every day drunk, too, and I covered up for his drunken mis-
takes. In exchange, he shared his friendship and knowledge with me.
“Zip. If the seal faces run past each other and are pressed together 
by the bellows, I would think they would get real hot, just like if we 
overtightened the lantern ring follower on the packed pump. Why 
doesn’t that also happen to the mechanical seal?”
“It certainly could happen, Mr. Norm, except that seal flush liq-
uid keeps the seal cool and lubricated. The seal flush liquid flows 
round the outside of the seal faces, along the shaft, and back into the 
pump case.”
“Okay. But where does the seal flush come from?”
“Out here, on our Alky Unit, most of the pumps are self-flushed 
pumps. That means the seal flush liquid comes from the discharge of 
the pump itself.”
Zip sketched the drawing to explain, which I’ve shown in 
Fig. 37.1.
“Zip, it seems like you’re saying that the seal itself is full of high-
pressure liquid from the pump discharge. Won’t that put an awful lot 
of pressure on the seals and cause them to leak?”
“No, Mr. Norm. You ain’t lookin’ at my sketch. See how that seal 
flush liquid comes through the restriction orifice? That orifice is just 
big enough for a couple GPMs to flow (one or two GPMs per inch of 
shaft diameter) into that seal flush chamber. The seal flush chamber is 

	
492	
C h a p t e r  T h i r t y - S e v e n
like the old stuffing box on the packed pump. That little seal flush 
flow leaks back into the suction side of the pump case through the 
holes in the back of the impeller.” (See Fig. 37.1.)
“I guess, Zip, that means the seal operates just above the pressure 
inside the pump case, which is a little below the pump suction pres-
sure,” I said.
37.3.1  Externally Flushed Pumps
“Zip, I’ve got another question. When I worked on our paving asphalt 
plant last year, did the asphalt pumps also use that black tar as seal 
flush?” I asked.
“No,” Zip answered. “Those were external flush pumps. Wouldn’t 
want to get tar between them seal faces. Those pumps were flushed 
with diesel oil or light gas oil. On that kind of pump, the operator 
needs to adjust the seal flush pressure a few psi above the pump suc-
tion pressure. Best to have a little needle valve and a rotometer. Also, 
you gotta have a pressure gauge after the needle valve on the seal 
flush line.”
“But Zip, the diesel used as the seal flush liquid will leak into the 
asphalt through the holes in the back of the impeller.”
“That surely is a problem. That’s why on external flush pumps, 
you gotta be real careful not to use too much seal flush pressure. Also, 
the seal flush liquid gotta be a kind that won’t ruin the product being 
pumped, if it contaminates a little.”

37.4  Seal Leaks
The main advantage the mechanical seal has over packing is that it’s 
designed not to leak. If it does leak a little, then the material that 
escapes from a self-flushed pump is the product. For an externally 
flushed pump that is leaking a few GPM, the material escaping is the 
seal flush liquid. For an externally flushed pump mechanical seal that 
is blown (i.e., leaking really badly), the product being pumped is 
escaping along the shaft. In refineries, this is both dangerous and 
environmentally objectionable.
The factors that cause mechanical seals to leak are numerous:
• Loss of seal flush flow.
• Particulates in seal flush.
• Pump vibrations due to cavitation.
• Pump vibrations due to bearing damage.
• Uneven heating of pump case prior to start-up.
• Loss of pump suction pressure on pump start-up. This, in 
my experience, is the single biggest contribution to reduced 
seal life.
• Leaving a pump idle (i.e., several months) for too long.
• Ice crystals (when pumping wet propane or butane) that 
form between the seal faces.
• Failure to fill the seal flush line prior to starting the pump.
• Excessive seal flush pressure.
A pump seal ought to last about six years. Running a seal dry for 
a few seconds during start-up can reduce the seal life by six months. 
For a self-flushed pump that loses suction pressure on start-up, there 
will be little or no seal flush pressure until a normal pump suction 
pressure is established. (See section on starting NPSH requirements 
in Chap. 36.) Also, a pump that cavitates on start-up, due to the loss 
of suction pressure, will vibrate, which also contributes to the dam-
age to the pump’s mechanical seal faces.
Sounds of Cavitation
I have read that pump cavitation is typically accompanied by the 
sound of nuts and bolts ratcheting around in a metal bucket. 
Much of the time this is not true. I typically cannot identify a 
large centrifugal pump in hydrocarbon service that is cavitating 
by the sound of the pump. If the pump discharge pressure is 
erratically low, this is a more reliable indication of cavitation 
than sounds omitted from the pump’s case. Erratically low motor 
driver amperage also indicates pump cavitation. 

	
494	
C h a p t e r  T h i r t y - S e v e n
If the radial support bearings are damaged, the resulting vibra-
tions will be transmitted to the seal and damage the seal faces. Water 
contamination of lube oil in the bearing house is the most common 
cause of bearing damage.
A pump case in hot service should be heated evenly prior to start-
ing or switching the pump. This is usually done by the warm-up valve 
on the pump discharge. This valve bypasses the discharge check valve, 
thus permitting the hot liquid being pumped by the primary pump to 
back into and preheat the spare pump that is being put online.
Leaving a pump in one position for months will dry out the bear-
ings and cause temporary distortion to the bearings and pump shaft. 
Running the pump for a few moments will correct these minor prob-
lems. But, during the run-in period, the vibrations may damage the 
seal faces. Operating experience indicates that switching pumps 
every week is far too frequent. Switching pumps once a year is far too 
infrequent. The optimum seems to be to run a pump every few 
months. Several smart people suggest that the primary pump should 
be run 90% of the time, while the spare is run 10% of the time and 
kept on partial standby.
To keep ice crystals from pushing the seal faces apart, due to 
autorefrigeration of the seal faces when pumping wet propane or 
butane, I used to keep a wisp of steam blowing onto the stuffing box 
to melt any ice crystals. I learned this nice trick from old Zip.
Particulates in the seal flush can scratch the seal faces. I’ve never 
actually encountered this problem myself, but it can be prevented by 
installing a Centrifix Filter on the seal flush line.
On one hydrocarbon pump, the restriction orifice was omitted 
from the seal flush line. This greatly increased the pressure on the seal 
faces. The seal blew out with a large and quite dangerous emission of 
hydrocarbon vapor to the atmosphere.
For self-flushed pumps, it is necessary to vent and fill the seal 
flush lines completely. Otherwise, on starting the pump, there will be 
no seal flush flow for a second or so, which will materially damage 
the seal.
For externally flushed pumps, this is not a problem as long as the 
seal flush is commissioned before the pump is switched on. Which is 
a problem.
37.5  Wasting External Seal Flush Oil
When a pump is not in operation, it is not necessary to have the seal 
flush flowing. Obviously for self-flushed pumps, this is not a prob-
lem, as the seal flush flow stops with the pump. But for externally 
flushed pumps, there is no sense leaving the seal flush running. For 
example, let’s say I’m operating a Delayed Coker or Visbreaker charge 
pump. The seal flush flow for such a pump, all of which flows back 
into the pump suction when the pump is idle, would be one or two 

	
C e n t r i f u g a l  P u m p s :  R e d u c i n g  S e a l  a n d  B e a r i n g  F a i l u r e s 	
495
GPM per inch of shaft diameter. For a 2-inch shaft with both inboard 
and outboard seals, that’s 400 BSD. If the seal flush is clean gas oil, 
400 BSD of gas oil will be recycled back through the coke drums or 
visbreaker soaker coils. At $15 (U.S.) a barrel downgrading cost, 
that’s $6000 (U.S.) a day. All to no purpose. Just remember to turn the 
seal flush back on before restarting the pump.
In black oil service, I’ve seen asphalt plant operators wait a few 
minutes after a pump is shut down before they block-in the external 
seal flush flow. Of course, for autostart pumps, leaving the external seal 
flush closed is not an acceptable option. But, in the above example, 
maintain the autostart option is costing $2 million a year in degraded 
product yields. I suppose that’s the justification for Nitrogen Barrier 
Seals, as described below.
37.6  Double Mechanical Seal
A self-flushed pump with a single set of mechanical seal faces can 
leak the process fluid into the environment. If the process fluid is 
hydrocarbons, this sort of leakage is no longer permitted by the EPA. 
The sketch I have shown in Fig. 37.1 does not represent the actual 
configuration of a double mechanical seal component, but does 
explain the function of the individual pump internal components 
(see reference 2 for an excellent description of the actual arrange-
ments of the internals for an overhung, wet sump, centrifugal pump).
The components of the pumps to the left of the inner seal faces are 
the same as that which I have previously described for a single 
mechanical seal. However, let’s go through the function of each com-
ponent starting at the left side of the sketch:
• Impeller—Accelerates the process liquid.
• Pressure Balancing Holes—Allows seal flush liquid that 
escapes past the throat bushing to flow back into the suction 
of the pump.
• Throat Bushing—Holds back pressure on the seal flush liquid 
against the inner seal faces. Or helps to control the flow of 
seal flush liquid, along with the restriction orifice.
• Filter—Removes particulates from the seal flush flow. Not 
always needed.
• Cooler—Removes heat from the seal flush flow. Not always 
needed.
• Restriction Orifice—Reduces the seal flush pressure to 
slightly above the pump suction pressure.
• Inner Seal—Prevents the inner seal flush liquid from escap-
ing along the shaft into the space between the inner and 
outer seals.

	
496	
C h a p t e r  T h i r t y - S e v e n
• Inner Springs—Presses the rotating inner seal face up against 
the stationary inner seal face.
• Reservoir—Holds the outer seal flush liquid.
• Pumping Ring—Helps circulate the outer seal flush liquid.
• Disaster Bushing—In case of a catastrophic seal failure, 
reduces the flow of process fluid to the environment.
• Outer Seal—Prevents the reservoir liquid from escaping 
along the shaft into the environment.
• Outer Seal Flush—Cools and lubricates the outer seal faces.
• Bearing Housing—Holds a pair of bearings, the lube oil, and 
slinger rings (slinger ring omitted from sketch).
• Lip Seals—Also called dust covers or carbon seals. Retards 
contamination of lube oil with dirty and humid air.
• Breather Cap—Permits air accumulated in the bearing hous-
ing to escape.
• Water Sediment Bulb and Petcock—Used to drain water out 
of the bearing housing.
The double mechanical seal does not really improve the reli-
ability of the pump’s seal. In case the inner seal begins to fail, the 
level and pressure in the outer seal reservoir will increase. An 
alarm should sound in the control room alerting the operators of 
the seal failure. As the reservoir pot is vented to the flare, this 
should prevent small seal leaks from escaping directly into the 
environment.
The fluid that circulates between the two sets of seal faces is an 
environmentally safe liquid such as glycol, which is called the buffer 
fluid. It’s circulated by the pumping ring. The reservoir may have a 
nitrogen makeup pressure control, cooling coil, and back-pressure 
control switch. I haven’t shown these details.4, 5 The main purpose of 
the double mechanical seal is to alert the operator that the inner seal 
has failed.
37.7  Dry Seals
One method of totally eliminating the use of externally flushed 
pumps using single mechanical seals is to use nitrogen barrier or 
dry seals. The seal faces are machined using a special technique. 
Nitrogen is then pressurized into the seal chamber and between the 
seal faces. These seals are very expensive (double the cost of con-
ventional seals) and the feedback I get from my clients is mixed. 
For self-flushed pumps, nitrogen barrier seals would serve no pur-
pose. Also, if a loss of flushing oil into the process fluid is not 

	
C e n t r i f u g a l  P u m p s :  R e d u c i n g  S e a l  a n d  B e a r i n g  F a i l u r e s 	
497
uneconomic, I would stay with a conventional seal. In refineries, I 
would use nitrogen barrier seals in:
• Vacuum Tower Bottoms
• Coker Feed
• Visbreaker Feed
• Residual Extraction (ROSE)
• Resid FCU Feed
The amount of nitrogen actually consumed is very small, and cer-
tainly does not affect the process itself.
Perhaps one-third to one-half of my clients react with hostility 
when I suggest the benefits of N2 seals, based on their experiences.
One of the problems with the use of ordinary N2 barrier seals is 
that they will be ruined if a pump spins backward, even briefly. This 
will happen when a pump is shut down after turning on the spare 
pump, if the discharge check valve leaks.
The solution to this problem is to install Bidirectional N2 Barrier 
Seals, which are designed to rotate in both directions. Considering 
that someone may leave open the warm-up valve around the check 
valve, when a pump is shut down, this may be a good investment.
37.8  Application of Nitrogen Barrier Seals Using Double 
Mechanical Seals
A dry or nitrogen barrier seal is typically used as the outer seal on a 
double mechanical seal (see Fig. 37.1). Double mechanical seals are 
used when the process fluid is environmentally objectionable or 
above its auto-ignition temperature. The nitrogen barrier seal replaces 
the reservoir fluid providing seal flush lubrication to the outer seal in 
the more conventional double mechanical seal.
As the inner seal for an externally flushed pump, such as a black oil 
(i.e., asphalt, resid), pump will continue to have the same loss of seal 
flush material to the process stream through the throat bushing with the 
conventional double mechanical seal as when the external seal is an N2 
seal, there is no real process incentive for use of the more costly N2 seal.
Theoretically, dry seals have a longer operational life than seals 
using reservoir fluid to lubricate the outer seal. In practice, in my 
experience, this is not the case. I’ve accumulated a partial list of some 
of the problems relayed to me by the operators at the Syncrude and 
Suncor upgrading plants in Alberta, Canada, summarized in the fol-
lowing section.
It is possible to use N2 on the inner seal and replace the external 
seal flush, but this is not a common practice and reportedly is quite 
costly.

	
498	
C h a p t e r  T h i r t y - S e v e n
As dry nitrogen barrier seals are about twice as expensive as a 
conventional seal, it’s rather difficult to see the justification of the 
incremental cost.
37.8.1  Problems with Nitrogen Barrier Dry Seals
I was teaching a seminar for operators at the Syncrude facility last 
week, and they had a host of complaints about N2 seals:
	
1.	 The nitrogen causes an idle spare pump to gas up and makes 
it difficult to switch pumps.
	
2.	 If the seal faces become wet with sour water, when a pump is 
taken out of service for maintenance, the seal may be damaged.
	
3.	 If the seal flush can be water (i.e., sour water or amine), the 
dry seal design serves no purpose.
	
4.	 If the pump runs backward, most (not all) nitrogen barrier 
seals will be ruined.
	
5.	 “Shouldn’t cooling tower and other water pumps just be 
packed and not have any mechanical seals—N2 or otherwise? 
Why then have our water pumps in this service been modi-
fied at great expense to double mechanical seals?” asked an 
older operator.
37.9  Steam Use in Seal Chamber
Sometimes low-pressure steam is connected to the pump’s stuffing 
box or seal chamber. I used to think that this steam was being used in 
the same way that nitrogen is used in a dry seal. This is quite wrong. 
The steam was being used for an entirely different purpose. It’s there 
to help keep the bellows (i.e., the spring assembly that is used to com-
press the seal faces) cool and clean. Hence, this steam pressure should 
be only a little above the pump suction pressure. In black oil services, 
the outside of the bellows can clog up with dirt without this flow of 
purge steam. Then the bellows would be unable to apply the proper 
pressure to the rotating seal face.
37.10  Pressure Balancing Holes
Referring to Fig. 37.1, note that the seal flush liquid enters the pump 
case between the rotating face (for internal assembly seals) and the 
back of the pump’s impeller. The idea is for the relatively small flow 
of the seal flush liquid to flow back into the suction of the pump, and 
thus be returned to the process steam. (Incidentally, for external 
assembly seals, the fixed face is closer to the impeller. See reference 2 
for details on internal vs. external assembly seals.)

For many impellers, holes have been drilled in the back face. 
These are called pressure balancing holes. They prevent the accumu-
lation of pressure behind the mechanical seal. This could cause the 
seal pressure to exceed the pump section pressure, which would 
overpressure the seal faces.
One of my clients that pumps hydrocarbons contaminated with 
solids has observed that these pressure balancing holes often plug. 
This will cause the pump’s seal to be damaged. This client has typi-
cally purchased mechanical seals designed for the pump’s discharge 
pressure to avoid seal failure, when the impeller balancing holes 
plug. Only a few percent of my clients design seals for the pump dis-
charge pressure, rather than follow the more conventional practice of 
designing the seal for the suction pressure.
37.11  Bearing Failures
The pump bearings support the weight of the shaft. Most pump bear-
ings are ball or roller type. For larger pumps with double suctions 
(i.e., balanced impellers), there will be both an inboard and outboard 
bearing. For most of the smaller pumps (i.e., overhung) with only a 
single suction connection, there will be a pair of inboard bearings, 
both located in the bearing housing.
Any damage to the pump’s bearings will cause vibrations that 
will be transmitted to, and damage the pump’s mechanical seal faces. 
The usual causes of bearing damage are:
• Moisture in the lube oil
• Low lube oil level in the bearing housing
• Excessive oil level in the bearing housing
In the wet sump system of bearing lubrication, the oil level should 
be kept just a bit below the bottom of the bearing. There is a loose ring 
in the bearing housing that slings the oil around. It’s called the Slinger 
Ring. There’s a sight port on the side of the pump case to see this lube 
oil level.
Inside the Oiler Glass itself, there is a screw to make fine adjust-
ments to the oil level. Within plus or minus ¼ inch, I don’t think the 
oil level is all that critical.
Excessive oil level, like halfway up the shaft diameter, will trap 
heat in the bearings and cause them to overheat.
Moisture is drawn into the bearing housing due to the rotation of 
the shaft. This moisture will accumulate in the bearing housing and 
ruin the lubrication properties of the lube oil. In Fig. 37.1, I’ve shown 
a Water Sediment Bulb that I’ve used to drain water from the bearing 
housing. This is not a complete solution to water contamination of 
the lube oil. The oil and water will become emulsified in spite of 
water being drained from the bottom of the housing.

C h a p t e r  T h i r t y - S e v e n
It’s easy to watch this problem develop. The oil level in the oiler 
glass increases due to the water, rather than slowly decrease, which is 
normal.
37.11.1  Oiler Glass Level Discrepancies
Sometimes the oil level in the oiler cup or glass is quite high, but the 
real oil level in the bearing housing is too low. I can think of four fac-
tors that can cause this problem that result in pump bearing damage.
	
1.	 The oiler glass should be located “upstream” of the direction 
of rotation. By upstream, I mean that if you are looking at the 
outboard end of the pump, and the impeller is rotating clock-
wise, the glass should be on the right-hand side of the pump. 
Locating the oiler on the other (i.e., wrong) side causes the oil 
to be slightly pushed up into the glass.
	
2.	 The bearing housing breather cap is plugged. Air is pushed 
into the bearing housing by the spinning shaft. The resulting 
air pressure in the housing can push the oil up into the glass. 
This breather cap needs to be periodically cleaned.
	
3.	 The connection between the oiler glass and the bearing hous-
ing plugs.
	
4.	 Moisture from the humid air drawn into the bearing housing 
condenses and displaces the oil upward into the oiler glass, 
as discussed above.
Many years ago, working as an outside operator during a strike 
(i.e., I was a scab), I noted that on some of my steam turbine–driven 
pumps, the level of oil in the oiler glasses rose perhaps ½ to 1 inch 
every day. I actually thought that in some mysterious way, that lubri-
cation oil was being produced inside the bearing housing. Of course, 
it was just water.
I’m older now, and much wiser. As discussed in the following 
section, use of an oil mist lubrication system eliminates all of the 
problems with erroneous oiler glass level indications and with mois-
ture in the lube oil.
37.11.2  Oil Mist System—Bearing Housing
My experience is only with the wet sump system for bearing lubrica-
tion. This means there is an oil level of several inches in the bearing 
housing. The oil level should be a fraction of an inch below the bot-
tom face of the bearing. This level can be precisely controlled with a 
screw adjustment inside the oiler glass located on the side of the bear-
ing housing.
However, I now understand that the oil mist lubrication system is 
superior to the wet sump system. In the oil mist method of bearing 
lubrication, a small stream of air containing atomized lube oil is 

	
C e n t r i f u g a l  P u m p s :  R e d u c i n g  S e a l  a n d  B e a r i n g  F a i l u r e s 	
501
blown continuously into the bearing housing. There is no liquid level 
maintained in the bearing housing, which is kept completely drained.
This eliminates the two main problems with the more conven-
tional wet sump lubrication system:
• Operating errors associated with improper lube oil levels are 
eliminated, as there is no level to maintain.
• The problem of water contamination of the lube oil due to 
moist air being drawn into the bearing housing by the spin-
ning shaft and leaking bearing housing dust covers (i.e., the lip 
seals), is totally eliminated. Water infiltrating into the bearing 
housing will emulsify with the oil, and thus degrade its lubri-
cation properties. With a totally drained bearing housing, 
water is immediately drained out of the bottom of the housing.
A large number of pumps can be lubricated from a centralized oil 
mist atomizing station. The design and construction of such a system 
is an additional and expensive project complication, compared to 
having an oiler glass on each pump. But, on the other hand, anything 
that reduces the probability of operator error is sure to increase unit 
reliability and reduce running up maintenance expenses. It is stan-
dard practice to have an automatic backup system for the oil mist 
generator.
37.11.3  Water Accumulation in the Bearing Housing  
of Turbine-Driven Pumps
Lieutenant Joe Petriceli was in command of the engine room in an 
aircraft carrier at the battle of Leyte Gulf in the Philippines in 1945. 
During the 1980 strike in Texas City, Joe taught me the following neat 
trick:
• A turbine driving a pump with an inboard bearing (which is 
normal) starts to blow steam out along its shaft, due to a 
defective gland seal.
• The steam impacts the inboard end of the bearing housing.
• The rate of water accumulation in the pump’s bearing hous-
ing increases by an-order-of-magnitude.
• To retard the moisture accumulation in the bearing housing, 
one takes a hose with dry plant air and blows it across the 
shaft between the coupling and the pump’s bearing housing 
to push the steam away from the bearings.
I worked for Amoco Oil from 1965 through 1981. Joe was just a 
sulfur plant shift foreman. But he was one of the most valuable 
employees Amoco had in Texas City. He was my friend and I think of 
him often.

C h a p t e r  T h i r t y - S e v e n
Another trick that I have learned recently that also helps to extend 
the bearing life, if an oil sediment bulb is not used, is to employ a 
magnetic drain plug. This helps to collect any metal particles in the 
oil reservoir so as to prevent them from becoming a hazard to the 
bearings.4 
37.11.4  Cloudy Lube Oil
If water is kept drained from the bearing housing using the water 
sediment bulb shown, bearing life can be extended. Once the oil takes 
on a cloudy appearance (0.1 percent water), the bearing life can be 
reduced by a factor of four to ten.5 During the 1974 strike in Texas 
City, I screwed the small water sediment bulbs into the ½-inch case 
drain on my pumps. I never actually looked for water in the bulbs. I 
would just drain a little fluid through the petcock to see if the lube oil 
was free of water. Then, if the level in the pump’s oiler glass dropped 
a bit, I was satisfied that the connection between the glass and the 
bearing housing was not plugged.
For plants equipped with a lube oil mist system, the bearing 
housing has no liquid level, so water contamination of the lube oil 
cannot happen.
One thing I did not do during the 1974 strike in Texas City was 
clean the bearing housing breather cap. Thus, some of my pumps 
would develop a slight positive pressure in the bearing housing. 
Which pushed up the oil level in the oiler glass, and pushed down the 
level in the bearing housing. I remember being mystified as to why 
the levels in the oiler glasses would increase by themselves over a 
period of a few days.
Continuous water or air accumulation in the bearing housing is 
an indication that the lip seals (or dust covers) need to be replaced. 
These lip seals are not expensive and their replacement is quite simple 
(see Fig. 37.1).
37.12  Starting a Centrifugal Pump
The objective in starting a centrifugal pump is to minimize the dam-
age to the pump’s mechanical seal during start-up. The facilities 
required for this purpose are:
• Pump suction pressure gauge downstream of the pump suc-
tion strainer.
• Vent and valves to remove vapors from the seal flush system 
(shown as valves 1, 2, and 3 in Fig. 37.1).
• A ½-inch drain valve on the bottom of the bearing housing 
(or water sediment bulb).
• A high point vent on the top of the pump case.

	
C e n t r i f u g a l  P u m p s :  R e d u c i n g  S e a l  a n d  B e a r i n g  F a i l u r e s 	
503
• For larger pumps with the suction on top of the pump case, a 
spill-back warm-up line connected to the case is needed to 
evenly warm up the pump. For all hot pumps, a spill-back 
bypass is needed around the pump’s discharge check valve 
for warm-up when switching pumps.
37.12.1  Preparation before Starting a Pump
	
1.	 For an externally seal-flushed pump, open the seal flush flow 
and adjust the seal flush pressure to the manufacturer’s rec-
ommended pressure above the suction pressure. If this data 
is not available, use the pump suction pressure plus 10 percent 
of the pump’s normal differential pressure. The seal flush 
pressure should not be close to the discharge pressure. This 
will damage the seal.
	
2.	 For the more common self-flushed pumps, vapors trapped 
inside the seal system tubing and coolers must be vented out 
and displaced with liquid. Otherwise, lubrication between 
the seal faces will be intermittent during start-up. A few sec-
onds of running a dry seal can cause a year’s worth of wear 
on the seal faces. Do not assume that because you have started 
up a pump without blowing the seal before, that no damage 
has been done.
	
3.	 Clean out the pump suction strainer. Check that the suction 
pressure gauge is operable and that the connection is not 
plugged. The unit engineer should have placed a red mark on 
this gauge showing the minimum required suction pressure 
to prevent cavitation on start-up.
	
4.	 For pumps that have an oiler glass (i.e., not used on the oil 
mist system), drain half of a glass, a few ounces of lube oil 
from the bearing housing. A bubble of air should rise in the 
oiler cup or glass and the cup level should drop a bit. Drain 
out all water and make sure the oil drained is clean and not 
cloudy. If not, damage to the bearings will cause vibration 
and damage to the seal faces.
	
5.	 Vent the top of the pump case to fill the case with liquid. For 
a self-flushed pump, starting with gas in the pump case will 
contaminate the seal flush tubing and cooler with vapor.
	
6.	 Open the spillback around the discharge check valve to warm 
the pump case. For pumps with the suction on top of the 
pump’s case, open the connection allowing the hot spill-back 
flow to recirculate to the bottom of the pump. The suction 
valve needs to be partly open. Wait until the pump case is 
uniformly warm. Starting a pump that is cold or unevenly 

	
504	
C h a p t e r  T h i r t y - S e v e n
heated will cause uneven stresses on the seal faces, or high-
viscosity liquid will remain between the seal faces to shear 
the seal faces. This step only applies when switching pumps, 
and not for a complete unit start-up.
37.12.2  Start-Up
	
1.	 It takes a lot of energy to accelerate the liquid in the suction 
line of a pump. The longer the suction line, the more energy 
is needed. The energy does not come from the pump, but 
from the pressure of the liquid itself. Thus, the pressure at the 
pump suction will drop radically if you open the discharge 
valve too quickly. This will cause the liquid to vaporize inside 
the pump. That’s cavitation, which is sure to damage the seal 
faces. The faster you open the discharge valve, the greater the 
reduction in suction pressure.
	
2.	 Opening up the discharge valve too slowly is also bad. Run-
ning a pump at an extremely low flow will cause vibration, 
overheat the seal, and dry out the faces.
	
3.	 So open the pump discharge valve as rapidly as possible, con-
sistent with not permitting the suction pressure to fall below 
the “red mark” on the pump suction gauge, that is, minimum 
pressure to avoid cavitation on start-up (see Chap. 34,  
Sec. 34.2). Do not be guided by the pump discharge pressure. 
By the time the discharge pressure becomes erratic, vapor is 
already being generated inside the pump case with conse-
quent damage to the seal faces.
	
4.	 Running a pump in a cavitating mode during start-up may 
not damage the seal faces to the extent that the seal will fail. 
However, a year’s worth of life from a seal can be lost in one 
minute due to cavitation on start-up.
Improper pump start-up is like cigarette smoking. The damage is 
cumulative. Switching pumps every month or two is a good idea to 
extend seal life. But not if starting-up the idle pump is done improp-
erly. Then, the seal life will be shortened even further. Pumps that sit 
idle for more than three months will cause bearings to be damaged 
when the pump is restarted. 
37.12.3  Additional Valving for Start-Up
The valving referred to in my start-up procedure is not provided in 
most applications. To evenly warm-up a large pump with the suction 
on top, you will have to install a connection from the warm-up line to 
the case drain at the bottom of the pump. If the pump case is not 
warmed-up uniformly, this will cause the seal faces to misalign dur-
ing start-up.

	
C e n t r i f u g a l  P u m p s :  R e d u c i n g  S e a l  a n d  B e a r i n g  F a i l u r e s 	
505
Referring to Fig. 37.1, in addition to valve 1, the valves shown as 
valves 2 and 3 must also be added. Without valves 2 and 3, the com-
plete seal flush line cannot be filled with liquid. For externally flushed 
pumps, valves 2 and 3 are not required.
For pumps with double mechanical seals, the fluid level in the 
reservoir should be checked. The correct level is in-line with the 
reservoir return nozzle. Too low a level will reduce the fluid circula-
tion rate.

CHAPTER 38
Control Valves
I 
am an anticommunist. That was not always so. But working in the 
former Soviet Socialist Republic of Lithuania altered my views 
about communism. Figure 38.1, drawn to scale, illustrates the rea-
son for my revised political orientation. Really! That’s the way the 
piping and control valves looked in the field. It happens because of 
bad design practices: 
	
1.	 The mechanical engineer specifies a pump so that it produces 
excessive head and flow, so that he cannot be accused of 
industrial sabotage by undersizing the pump.
	
2.	 The piping engineer oversizes process lines to avoid being 
branded an enemy of the people.
	
3.	 The Soviet instrument engineer must then install a small con-
trol valve that will consume all the excess pressure without 
operating too far in the closed position.
Control valves only work properly within a certain range of posi-
tions. When a control valve is mostly closed (perhaps 5 to 10 percent 
open), opening it a little bit more will increase flow a lot. When a control 
valve is mostly open (perhaps 80 to 90 percent), opening it a lot more 
will hardly increase the flow at all. To summarize, a control valve can 
only respond to a change in position in a linear fashion, between 20 to 
80 percent open. To avoid the control valve operating in the non-linear, 
mostly closed position, the Soviet instrument engineer installed a small 
control valve that has a giant DP at 50 percent open.
If a control valve is operating too far closed, I will partially close 
the upstream gate valve to force the control valve to operate in the 20 
to 80 percent range. This is a bad practice. The high velocity passing 
between the gate and the seat will erode the valve seat. Then, when 
the valve is shut, it will leak through and fail in its function as an 
isolation valve.
A normal installation will have the control valve one line size 
smaller than the process piping. For example:
• Line size = 10 inches, control valve = 8 inches
• Line size = 8 inches, control valve = 6 inches
507

	
508	
T h i r t y - E i g h t
• Line size = 6 inches, control valve = 4 inches
• Line size = 4 inches, control valve = 3 inches
Thus, simply changing the trim to a maximum size in an existing 
control valve may not eliminate the control valve as an hydraulic 
restriction. The term “trim” refers to the internals inside the control 
valve. If the control valve is smaller than the line size, reducing the 
control valve pressure drop to a minimum will be more complicated 
than just changing the trim. The piping reducers shown in Fig. 38.1, 
on either side of the control valve, will also have to be resized. This 
will be a big job if these piping reducers are welded rather than 
flanged. I made this mistake on a process revamp project in Lithuania. 
I specified that the maximize size trim on a control valve be installed. 
But I forgot to specify that a full line size control valve also be 
installed.
Many engineering design organizations adhere to the following 
practice in sizing control valves and pumps. The control valve 
operating at normal design conditions will consume 50 percent of the 
frictional losses through the system. For example, for a pumparound 
circuit on a distillation tower:
• Frictional loss through heat exchangers = 60 psi
• Head increase of flowing fluid is equivalent to 20 psi (about 
50 ft)
• Pressure drop through the control valve = 60 psi
• Total differential pressure developed by the pump = 140 psi
While this practice may result in good process control, it also 
causes energy waste due to parasitic pressure loss in the control valve. 
It’s a conservative way to design pumping systems. But for me, it’s 
just communism. It’s an abdication of our responsibility to design 
process equipment that benefits the long-term energy efficiency of 
the plant.

38.1  Pumps and Control Valves
The relationship I’ll now describe between a control valve and a 
pump applies to a constant speed motor-driven centrifugal pump. 
This covers more than 90 percent of the systems we encounter.
For variable-speed pumps, such as steam turbine–driven pumps, 
control valves should not be used. The facility shown in Fig. 38.2 is a 
control scheme that is used not infrequently at older plants. It’s a fine 
piece of technology, which has been lost with time. No control valve 
is used. The turbine speed is altered to directly maintain the vessel 
level. With the increasing use of variable-speed alternating-current 
motors, elimination of parasitic control valves should become more 
common.
For the ordinary fixed-speed motor centrifugal pump, I suggest 
the following rules when selecting a control valve:
• The valve should operate between 40 and 60 percent open at 
design conditions.
• If I want to allow for future expansion, I’ll oversize the valve 
and use an internal trim of reduced size.

• The normal pressure drop across the control valve should 
be sufficient for the pump to operate (see Fig. 38.3) on the 
flat part of the pump’s performance curve. These curves 
are published in reference manuals by the pump vendors. 
The flat portion of the curve in Fig. 38.3 has been labeled 
“good.”
• The control valve should not be sized for the steep portion of the 
curve. I have labeled this part of the curve “bad” in Fig. 38.3.
The idea is for the centrifugal pump and control valve to work as 
a team to control flows. The pump and valve have to be selected 
together if the valve is to control the process with a minimum of 
wasted pumping power.
38.2  Operating on the Bad Part of the Curve
I last saw this problem at a 100,000 BSD flashed crude charge pump in 
Corpus Christi, Texas. It looked like the pump was cavitating. The 
pump discharge pressure was erratically low. The flow was also swing-
ing. The control valve position was erratic. I checked the motor driver 
amps, which were also erratic. All observations indicated cavitation.
As I did not have reference to the pump curve in the field, I now 
proceeded as follows: I switched the control valve from automatic 
flow control (FRC) to manual. The flow became steady, as did the 
discharge pressure and motor amperage. Now I understood the 
problem was not cavitation, but a control problem.

As I manually closed the valve, the amperage on the motor driver 
went up. This meant that the pump discharge pressure was increas-
ing faster than the flow was decreasing. Check the flow versus power 
curve in Fig. 38.3. The pump was operating on the steep or “bad” 
portion of its performance curve.
Normally, motor amps increase as a downstream control valve is 
opened. If you observe the opposite, then the control valve operation 
will be erratic, because you are attempting to control the flow too far out 
on the pump’s curve. This is another reason why the centrifugal pump 
and the control valve need to be designed to work together as a team. 
This is exactly what the communist engineers in Lithuania failed to do.
38.3  Control Valve Position
The control valve position shown on the control screen is not the 
actual control valve position. The valve position displayed in the con-
trol center is the required valve position. It is quite wrong to assume 
the valve position shown in the control room represents the real valve 
position in the field.
Liz used to make the same mistake. She would tell me to uproot 
a tree stump, then assume it was done. She is smarter now. She 
inspects the job in the field. Liz suspects I’ll cover the stump with 
earth and pretend that I extracted it from our garden. It’s the same in 
the plant. To know the real control valve position you must go into 
the field and inspect the valve.
Control valves have a tendency to stick. Even though the valve is 
shown to be moving on the panel screen, it may not be moving in the 
field. This is easy to check. The stem of the valve should be shiny and 
bright. This indicates that the stem has been traveling up and down 
recently. If the stem is covered with dirt, ask the panel operator to 
“stroke” the valve. This means he will fully open the valve and then 
fully close the valve. The valve stem has a position indicator. You can 
observe in the field if the valve opens and closes to its full extent.
Some control valves move in fits and starts. They stick and then 
jerk open suddenly. When I consulted in a refinery in Aruba, the fuel 
gas pressure was extremely erratic. High fuel gas pressure caused 
excess gas to be flared. Low pressure caused propane to be vaporized 
into the fuel gas header. Sometimes the plant would be flaring fuel 
gas and making up with propane simultaneously!
I worked on this problem for six years. Control experts devised 
advanced, real-time, computer control programs. Meetings were held 
to resolve the issue. Finally, I observed that the control valve on the 
liquid propane flow to the vaporizer would stick in a closed position 
and suddenly jerk open to 60 percent, where it would stick. It took six 
years for me to identify and two hours to correct the cause of the 
unstable fuel gas pressure. Of course, this erratic valve position was 
not seen on the control center panel.

38.4  Valve Position Dials
Figure 38.4 shows a control valve installation in the field. Next to the 
control valve there will be a small cabinet with three dials displayed: 
• Supply: This is the supply air pressure. It should not change. 
If there is no instrument air pressure, the control valve will 
not work.
• Signal: Sometimes labeled “Input.” This is a signal from either 
the control center (if control is remote) or from another instru-
ment (if control is local).
• Output: This is the instruction to the control valve as to its 
required position.
The Signal and Output dials should have the same reading. Let’s 
assume that this is an “air-to-close valve.” That means that more air 
pressure closes the valve. Typically, the supply air pressure is 30 psig. 
If the air output pressure to the control valve is 3 psig, the valve 
should be 100 percent open. If the air output pressure to the control 
valve is 15 psig, the valve would be shut. We say the valve operates

between 3- to 15-psig air pressure. If the output air pressure was 
9 psig, the valve should be 50 percent open. But if the valve is stuck, 
it may be in any position. It will not open regardless of air pressure to 
the diaphragm. Or the diaphragm itself may have malfunctioned.
38.5  Air-to-Open Valves
Many valves are air-to-open valves. The process engineer decides 
whether a control valve should be air-to-close or air-to-open, based 
on the fail-safe position of the valve if the instrument air pressure is 
lost. For example:
• A back-pressure control valve on a wet gas absorber should 
fail in an open position on loss of instrument air pressure.
• A fuel gas regulator for a control valve to a furnace should 
fail in the closed position on loss of instrument air pressure.
For many (but not all) control valves, you can tell if air pressure is 
supposed to open or close the valve. If the tubing to the diaphragm is 
on the top, as shown in Fig. 38.4, then the air pressure is usually (but 
not always) going to close the valve. When in doubt, ask the panel 
operator to move the valve. Touch the stem with your gloved finger 
and see what happens to the air pressure of the output dial.
38.6  Saving Energy in Existing Hydraulic Systems
The pumping power lost across a control valve is approximately:
	
KWH
(GPM) (s.g.)
2200
= ∆
	
where KWH = power in kilowatts converted to heat in the control 
valve
 
D = pressure drop, psi
 
GPM = (U.S.) gallons per minute
 
s.g. = specific gravity
Installation only of a larger control valve, or larger valve trim, 
will save zero energy regardless of the result of the above calcula-
tion. In addition to modification of the control valve, the upstream 
centrifugal pump must also be modified. Assuming that the pump is 
driven by a fixed-speed AC motor, the size of the pump’s impeller 
has to be reduced. The smaller impeller plus the larger control valve 
will result in:

where % KWH = percent of power saved on the motor
 
DN = diameter of new impeller
 
DO = diameter of old impeller
The pump vendor publishes a family of curves for different size 
impellers. Using the rules described in this chapter, you can select an 
energy efficient combination of a new pump impeller and a new or 
modified control valve.
The size of the motor is not significant. The power required to run 
a motor depends on what it is driving, not on the horsepower rating 
of the motor itself.
Even on a brand new unit, you should not be surprised if 30 to 
50 percent of the amperage on a driver can be saved. Again, for 
turbine-driven pumps the goal is not to optimize the size of the con-
trol valve but to totally eliminate the control valve.
38.7  Control Valve Bypasses
The hydraulic capacity of a system is sometimes limited by pump 
capacity and sometimes limited by the sizes of the control valve. To 
discriminate between these two problems:
	
1.	 With the control valve wide open, open the control valve 
bypass.
	
2.	 If the flow increases by a lot, the control valve is too small.
	
3.	 If the flow increases very little (less than 5 percent), the prob-
lem is the pump.
Operating with a control valve bypass open is not permitted by 
many operating companies. In theory, I agree that control valve 
bypasses should be kept closed. In practice, I frequently have 
opened bypasses. For example, we have a fired heater that is lim-
ited by the unit charge pump. Opening the bypasses around the 
heater pass control valves seems reasonable and safe. But suppose 
there is a leak in a heater tube. The panel operator closes the pass 
control valve remotely to stop the fire, but the flow continues 
through the bypass valve. The reader can imagine how I became so 
smart on this subject.
Running for a long period of time with a control valve bypass 
open in hydrocarbon service should be considered a change in opera-
tion requiring a HAZOP review. For me, as a field troubleshooter, I’ll 
always close all control valve bypasses I opened during my investiga-
tions before I leave the plant in the evening.

38.8  Plugged Control Valves
When pumping dirty water through a small ported control valve  
(1 inch or less), the valve may easily plug. I can back-flush the valve 
to blow the dirt out (refer to Fig. 38.5):
 
1. Open control valve D 100 percent.
	
2.	 Close valve B.
	
3.	 Open valve C.
 
4. Open drain valve A. (Perhaps routing the drain via a hose to 
the flare or enclosed sewer might be safer.)
Water will now flow backward through the control valve. 
Especially since there will be little or no back-pressure at valve A, 
I have found this to be a highly effective method to clear small 
plugged control valves.

CHAPTER 39
Separators: 
Vapor-Hydrocarbon- 
Water
Liquid Settling Rates
T
his chapter precedes the chapter on centrifugal compressors 
for a sound reason. Damage to high-speed centrifugal com-
pressors is most often associated with slugs of liquid enter-
ing the compressor from an upstream knockout drum. The other 
major use of knockout drums is to separate droplets of liquid from 
gas streams to be used for fuel or further processing. Separating 
droplets of water from liquid hydrocarbon is also discussed in this 
chapter.
39.1  Gravity Settling
The majority of the process vessels you see in your plant are gravity, 
vapor-liquid separators. Their main purpose is to settle out droplets 
of entrained liquid from the up-flowing gas. Factors that affect the 
settling rate of these droplets are
• Droplet size.    Big droplets settle faster than little droplets. Con-
trary to that nonsense we were taught in school, cannonballs 
do drop faster then BBs—if one accounts for the resistance of 
air (BBs are small spheres of lead shot used in air guns).
• Density of vapor.    The less dense the vapor, the faster the 
droplet settling rate.
• Density of liquid.    The more dense the liquid droplets, the 
faster the droplet settling rate.
517

	
518	
C h a p t e r  T h i r t y - N i n e
• Velocity of vapor.    The slower the vertical velocity of the 
vapor, the faster the settling rate.
• Viscosity of the vapor.    The lower the vapor viscosity, the 
faster the settling rate.
All these ideas have been put into one equation, called Stokes’ law. 
Nothing against Sir Frederick Stokes, but vapor viscosities are almost 
always so small that they do not affect settling rates. Also, we never 
know the particle size distribution of the droplets. There is a more 
fruitful way to look at the settling tendency of droplets of liquid in an 
up-flowing vapor stream, as shown in Fig. 39.1. The method states
• The lifting force of the vapor is proportional to the momen-
tum of the vapor.
• The lifting force of the vapor is inversely proportional to the 
density of the liquid, which we will call DL (lb/ft3).
I’ll put this in equation form:

The momentum of the vapor equals

where M = mass of vapor, lb

cross-sectional area is

where DV = density of vapor, lb/ft3.

Thousands of experiments have been made both in the plant and in 
the laboratory to determine K values for different levels of entrainment. 
Here are the results:
• K = ≤ 0.15: very slight entrainment
• K = 0.23: normal to low entrainment (less than 1 wt.% liquid 
in vapor)
• K = 0.35: high entrainment
• K = ≥ 0.50: very severe entrainment (more than 5 wt.% liquid 
in vapor)
I feel sure, dear reader, that you are objecting to my use of such 
terms as “slight” and “severe,” as these are qualitative terms. Well, 
we do not know enough about entrainment to quantify it. Also, we 
have neglected such obviously important factors in the knockout 
drum, shown in Fig. 39.1, as:
• Vertical height between the inlet nozzle and the vapor outlet
• The clearance between the liquid level (or, more properly, the 
froth level) and the feed inlet

	
520	
C h a p t e r  T h i r t y - N i n e
• The turbulence of the vapor and liquid as they enter the drum
• The degree of dispersion of the liquid in the vapor
All I am saying is don’t take Eq. (39.6) or the tabulated K values as the 
ultimate truth. The calculated tendency of a vapor to entrain liquid is more 
akin to an educated guess, rather than a precise engineering calculation.
A simple K-value calculation might be helpful here. Let’s use 
Eq. (39.6) and Fig. 39.1 to calculate the tendency to entrain droplets of 
liquid in the knockout (KO) drum shown in Fig. 39.1.

where the K value of 1.2 indicates that extremely severe entrainment 
would be certain from this KO drum. If we expected moderate entrain-
ment, the volumetric gas flow to the vessel would have to be reduced 
by 80 percent, or the vessel diameter would have to more than double.
Normal vertical knockout drums are designed for a K value of 
about 0.20 to 0.25. If we are installing a KO drum ahead of a reciprocat-
ing compressor—and they really hate liquids in their feed—a K value of 
0.14 might be selected. If we really do not care very much about entrain-
ment, a K value of 0.4 might be selected. An example of this would be 
venting waste gas to the flare from a sour-water stripper reflux drum.
39.2  Demisters
Figure 39.1 shows an 8-inch-thick demister below the top head. A 
demister pad resembles a giant Brillo pad without the soap. Many pro-
cess plants have discarded demister pads lying around their scrap 
heaps, so you may have already seen what they look like.
The theory of operation of a demister is simple. Vapor and droplets 
of liquid strike the demister with a substantial velocity. The force of this 
impingement velocity causes the tiny droplets of liquid to coalesce into 
larger droplets. The heavier droplets fall out of the up-flowing vapor.
For a KO drum with a demister to work properly, it apparently must 
have a K value of at least 0.15 to 0.20. I say “apparently” because in at least 
one service, I have noted an increase in entrainment from a vessel equipped 
with a demister at lower K values. This service was a sulfur plant final-
effluent condenser. I suppose the vapors must strike the demister’s fibers 
with some minimum force, to encourage droplets to coalesce.
Knockout drums equipped with demisters, according to what is 
written in other books, can tolerate K values 30 to 50 percent higher 
than can ordinary KO drums. More importantly, demisters definitely 
do scrub out much smaller droplets from a flowing gas stream than 
could settle out by gravity settling alone. The most common example 

	
S e p a r a t o r s :  Va p o r - H y d r o c a r b o n - W a t e r 	
521
of effective demister use is the removal of entrained boiler feedwater 
from steam generators. Boilers equipped with demisters produce steam 
of better quality; that is, the removal of the entrained droplets of water is 
accelerated and also hardness deposits are removed from the flowing 
steam. This is especially beneficial in keeping downstream superheater 
tubes and steam turbine rotor blades free of hardness deposits.
39.2.1  Demister Failure
A rather large percentage of demisters I have encountered wind up 
on the scrap heap. Usually, this is due to plugging. If the flowing 
vapor is entraining corrosion products, coke, or other particulates, 
the demister will probably plug. The particulates will stick to the 
demister’s fibers. Also, I have seen terrible demister plugging due to 
corrosion of the demister’s fibers. Because of the large surface area of 
the demister, a relatively low corrosion rate will produce a large 
amount of corrosion deposits. It is much like that rusty Brillo pad you 
left by the kitchen sink for a few weeks.
When a demister plugs, it increases the pressure drop of the vapor. 
But the pressure drop cannot increase a lot, because the demister will 
break. Demister failure creates two problems:
• The dislodged sections of the demister pad are blown into 
downstream equipment, as into the suction of a centrifugal 
wet-gas compressor.
• The failed demister promotes high localized velocities. Vapor 
blows through the open areas of the vessel. The remaining 
sections of the demister pad impede vapor flow. The resulting 
high, localized vapor velocities create more entrainment than 
we could have had without any demister.
Knockout drums handling gas with particulates are usually better off 
without a demister, unless there is a provision to back-wash the demister. 
The demister must be made out of a corrosion-resistant material. In many 
services, a high-molybdenum-content stainless steel is sufficient.
A little bit of entrainment is not always bad. For example, entraining 
a clean naphtha mist into the suction of a wet-gas centrifugal com-
pressor is fine. The mist helps keep the rotor parts clean. If the steam 
from a boiler is to be used to reboil towers, entrainment is of no con-
sequence, as long as the steam is not superheated.
39.3  Entrainment Due to Foam
A light, frothy foam is naturally more susceptible to entrainment than 
a clear, settled liquid. Knockout drums handling foam, therefore, 
should be designed for a lower K value. Perhaps the K value that can 
be tolerated might be reduced by 25 to 35 percent in the anticipation 
of such foam.

	
522	
C h a p t e r  T h i r t y - N i n e
But foam may have a rather dramatic effect on entrainment, 
through a mechanism that is unrelated to vapor velocity. The 
problem I am referring to is high foam level. We already discussed 
this problem in Sec. 11.1.2, in the section devoted to level control. 
Figure 39.2 illustrates this problem.
The level shown in the gauge glass is 18 inches below the inlet 
nozzle. This is okay. But inside the drum we have foam. The average 
density of the foam plus liquid in the drum might be 0.60. The den-
sity of the clear liquid in the gauge glass is 0.80. Referring back to the 
logic in Chap. 11, the foam level in the tower is then 33 percent higher 
than the liquid level in the gauge glass.
Once this foam level rises above the feed inlet nozzle, the vapor in 
the feed blows the foam up the drum. A massive carry-over of liquid 
(or foam) into the vapor line then results. I mentioned above that a

523
small amount of mist carry-over to a centrifugal compressor helped 
keep the rotor clean and did no harm. Sudden slugs of liquid into the 
compressor inlet are another matter. They are likely to unbalance the 
rotor and cause substantial damage. If the compressor is a high-speed 
(10,000-rpm) multistage machine, it is likely to be wrecked by a slug 
of liquid. Even a small surge of liquid entering a reciprocating com-
pressor can be very bad. The intake valves are almost certain to be 
damaged. Typically, the valve plate will break.
Use of Vortex Tubes marketed by EGS systems has been shown to 
suppress carry-over of foam.
39.4  Water-Hydrocarbon Separations
Figure 39.3 shows a reflux drum serving a distillation column. We 
have a reflux drum because
• The drum provides a few minutes of holdup for the overhead 
product and reflux. This prevents the reflux pump from losing 
suction should the amount of liquid discharging from the pump 
briefly exceed the amount of liquid draining from the condenser.

C h a p t e r  T h i r t y - N i n e
• The reflux drum separates liquid and wet gas by gravity set-
tling. A horizontal vapor-liquid separator works in much the 
same way as the vertical KO drum.
• The horizontal reflux drum also separates hydrocarbon liquid 
from water.
Why do we usually want to separate water from the reflux stream, 
as shown in Fig. 39.3? Some of the bad things that happen to the dis-
tillation tower if water persistently entrains into the reflux are
• The distillation tray efficiency is reduced. The water may 
settle out beneath the hydrocarbon liquid on the tray. This 
reduces contact between the up-flowing vapor and the down-
flowing, internal reflux.
• The tray may flood. Water and hydrocarbon mixing on the 
tray deck, stirred up by the flowing gas, creates an emulsion. 
The emulsion does not separate as readily as clear liquid from 
the gas. Premature downcomer backup followed by tray deck 
flooding result.
• Tray deck, downcomer, and vessel wall corrosion is increased. 
Water conducts electricity a thousand times better than do 
liquid hydrocarbons. Corrosion involves the transfer of elec-
trons between steel and inorganic molecules, such as
• Hydrochloric acid to form ferric chlorides
• Hydrogen cyanide to form ferric cyanide
• Carbon dioxide to form iron carbonate
• Hydrogen sulfide to form iron bisulfide
The water acts as a highway for the electrons (the term electrons 
comes from the word electricity) to move between these potentially 
corrosive molecules and the vessel wall.
Water in reflux tends to get trapped in the tower if the tower-
bottom temperature is above the boiling point of water at the tower’s 
operating pressure. The water trickles down the tower and revapor-
izes off of the hot reboiler tubes. As the water may be saturated with 
corrosive salts and gases, reboiler tube corrosion can be rapid. In 
almost every petroleum refinery service, refluxing water is a quick 
route to reboiler tube leaks.
39.4.1  Water Settling and Viscosity
Water droplets settle out of a lighter liquid hydrocarbon phase 
because of gravity. The water is denser than the liquid hydrocarbons. 
Liquid droplets settle out of a lighter gas phase faster because of 
gravity. What is the difference? The difference is viscosity. We 
neglected the effect on the gas viscosity when calculating the K value 
in KO drums. Gas viscosities are almost always very low.

	
S e p a r a t o r s :  Va p o r - H y d r o c a r b o n - W a t e r 	
525
But liquid viscosities are extremely variable. At a constant vis-
cosity, the settling rate of water in another liquid due to gravity is 
proportional to
(Density of water) − (density of liquid in the reflux drum)
For water settling out of gasoline, in the reflux drum shown in 
Fig. 39.3, the settling rate is between 0.5 and 1 ft/min. If a small droplet 
of water has to fall through a layer of hydrocarbon 3 ft deep, it would 
take about 3 to 6 minutes. If the hydrocarbon is less dense and less 
viscous than gasoline (like butane), the settling rate will be faster. If 
the hydrocarbon is more dense and more viscous than gasoline (like 
diesel oil), settling time will be longer.
The most important feature of the reflux drum shown in Fig. 39.3  
is the riser, a piece of pipe 4 to 12 inches high protruding from the  
bottom of the drum. Water first settles to the bottom of the drum.  
The water then runs along the bottom of the drum into the water 
draw-off boot.
Sometimes corrosion products fill the bottom of the drum. Some-
times holes corrode through the base of the riser or the riser falls off. 
Either way, settled water can be drawn off the reflux drum into the 
suction of the reflux pump.
39.4.2  Interface-Level Control
Water is drained off the boot to maintain an interface level between 
water and hydrocarbon in the boot. These interface level control-
lers, especially on reflux drum water draw-off boots, are typically 
set locally. The operator finds the visible interface level in the boot’s 
gauge glass, and then sets the local interface level controller to hold 
the level halfway down the boot. Level taps in the lower portion of 
any vessel tend to plug. This is especially true with the level taps in 
water draw-off boots. You need to blow out these taps on a frequent 
basis, because a high boot interface level can push water into the 
tower’s reflux pump.
39.5  Electrically Accelerated Water Coalescing
39.5.1  Electrostatic Precipitation
One really good method to speed up the settling rate of water is with 
electricity. Water is a polar molecule, meaning that one side of the water 
molecule is positively charged and the other side is negatively 
charged. It is this polar characteristic of water that makes it a good 
conductor of electricity (a highway for electrons). For example, we 
have the story of the operator who encountered a small electrical fire 
and, not having any water handy, decided to extinguish the fire by 
urinating on it. That was the last decision that operator ever made.

	
526	
C h a p t e r  T h i r t y - N i n e
Hydrocarbons, on the other hand, are nonpolar molecules. They 
are not particularly affected by electricity. We can take advantage of 
this difference between polar water and nonpolar hydrocarbons to 
accelerate water settling.
An electric precipitator contains sets of electric plates. A high- 
voltage (20,000-V) electric current is applied across these plates, or 
electrodes. The droplets of water are electrically attracted to these 
plates, or grids. The water droplets coalesce into larger heavier drop-
lets on the plates. They fall rapidly to the bottom of the electric pre-
cipitator vessel.
These precipitators may increase the settling rate of water by a 
factor of about 5. For example, settling droplets of sulfuric acid out  
of alkylate (a light hydrocarbon) by gravity alone might take an hour. 
A good electric precipitator can do a better job in just 10 min. Precipi-
tators do not really consume much electricity. It is true that the elec-
tricity is applied at a very high voltage to speed up settling, but the 
amount of current drawn—or rather the amount of current that is 
supposed to be drawn—is nil.
If you see the amps on your precipitator creeping up or spiking 
up, something is beginning to short-circuit the electric grids or insu-
lators. Perhaps corrosion products are falling off the walls of the pre-
cipitator vessel. In my experience, this is the most common cause of 
precipitator failure.
39.5.2  Electric Precipitators in Mist Removal
On my sulfuric acid production unit in Texas City, we had an electro-
static precipitator to remove a liquid sulfuric acid mist from a flowing 
gas stream. It worked in the same way as a precipitator in liquid-liquid 
service. However, the electrodes or grids were not parallel plates. As 
illustrated in Fig. 39.4, the grids were lead tubes and lead-coated 
wires. The gas flowed through about 400 8-inch diameter lead tubes, 
arranged in parallel. It was rather like a single-pass, shell-and-tube 
heat exchanger (see Chap. 26).
This electric sulfuric acid–mist precipitator worked fine, until one 
of the lead-coated wires inside the tubes broke. Then the entire pre-
cipitator would arc. This means the amps would jump up and down, 
as the single broken wire flapped around inside the tube. I do not 
know why, but the wires failed only on weekends. Then your fearless 
author would crawl inside the precipitator, cut out the broken wire, 
and plug the tube with a wooden plug. I’ve saved a piece of the lead 
wire. It’s a memento of what I do best.
39.6  Static Coalescers
A coalescer works in the same way as a demister, except that it is used 
to accelerate the removal of droplets of a heavier liquid from a flow-
ing lighter liquid. An ordinary coalescer is shown in Fig. 39.5.

This coalescer was used to remove entrained caustic from a flowing 
isobutane stream. The liquid isobutane would impact the coalescer 
pad at a velocity of 1 to 2 ft/min. The droplets of caustic, which have 
a higher surface tension than isobutane, would adhere to the surface 
of the coalescer fibers. As the caustic droplets grew bigger and 
heavier, they would drain down the fibers of the pad and into the 
boot.
This particular coalescer pad was made out of ordinary straw. It 
would gradually plug and lose its effectiveness every few days. To 
restore its efficiency, we would open the intermittent water-wash 
valve, shown in Fig. 39.5, for 15 minutes to wash off the offending 
deposits.
Well, one day (this was in 1974), I decided that the use of straw in 
a modern industrial process plant was inappropriate. I ordered a new 
coalescer pad constructed from state-of-the-art synthetic fibers. We 
replaced the sorry-looking straw pad with the really attractive, modern 
fiber pad—which did not coalesce nearly as well as the straw. The 
moral of this story is, of course, “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.”
Some coalescers consist of sets of parallel, slightly sloping, horizontal 
plates. The idea is to reduce the settling height and hence speed settling. 
My experience with this sort of coalescer is quite positive.

40.1  Relationship between Heat and Work
Julius Robert Mayer was a physician practicing near Bavaria in the 
1840s. As part of his research into human metabolism, he decided to 
determine the equivalence between heat and work.
Heat means British thermal units, or the amount of fuel we have 
to burn to increase the temperature of a pound of water by one degree 
Fahrenheit. Work means foot-pounds, or the amount of effort needed 
to raise a one-pound brick by one foot.
The experiments that people like Dr. Mayer performed established 
the technical basis for the Industrial Revolution. Dr. Mayer himself 
laid the foundation for the main pillar supporting this technical basis. 
529

C h a p t e r  F o r t y
This was the science of thermodynamics. But in the nineteenth century, 
they had not coined the word thermodynamics. They called it “heat in 
motion.”1 The branch of science that we now call thermodynamics was 
developed by simply heating air under different conditions.
For example, let us pretend we are heating air with a wax can-
dle. The air is confined inside a glass cylinder. We can assume that 
all the heat generated by burning the wax is absorbed by the air 
inside the cylinder. This is called an adiabatic process. I have shown a 
picture of the cylinder in Fig. 40.1.
The air in this cylinder is confined by a glass piston. The edges of the 
piston have been greased, so that the piston can glide without friction, 
up and down through the cylinder. But the edges of the piston itself have 
been so carefully ground that no air can slip between the greased piston 
and the walls of the cylinder. This means that the pounds of air con-
tained in the cylinder below the piston will always be constant.
Dr. Mayer first wanted to determine how much wax he had to burn 
to heat the air inside the cylinder by 100°F. At this point in the experi-
ment, he had to make a decision. Should he allow the expanding hot air 
to push the piston up? Or should he fix the position of the piston?
If the piston was kept in a fixed position, the pounds of air trapped 
inside the cylinder would continue to occupy a constant volume, as

the air was heated. The pressure of the air would increase as it was 
heated, but the volume of air would remain constant.
If the piston was not kept in a fixed position, the pounds of air 
trapped inside the cylinder would stay at a constant pressure as the 
air was heated. The volume of the air would increase as it was heated, 
but the pressure of the air would remain constant.
Which is the correct way to conduct this experiment? Again, the 
objective of this experiment is to see how much wax has to be burned 
(which I will now call heat) to increase the temperature of a fixed 
weight of air by 100°F. Well, Dr. Mayer decided to conduct the experi-
ment in both ways, to see if it made any difference. And this decision 
by Dr. Mayer was a turning point in human history.
Dr. Mayer already knew the weight of wax needed to heat 1 lb of 
water by 1°F. His British colleagues had previously determined this 
quantity and had called it a British thermal unit (Btu).
He began by heating the air with the piston in a fixed position. Thus, 
the volume of air heated was kept constant. The amount of heat (in Btu) 
needed to heat a fixed weight of air, under constant volume conditions, 
he called Cv. This is now called the specific heat of air at constant volume.
Next, Dr. Mayer heated the air, but allowed the piston to rise as 
the hot air expanded. This kept the pressure in the cylinder just a little 
bit above atmospheric pressure. The Btu needed to heat a fixed weight 
of air under constant pressure conditions, he called Cp.
Well, Cp turned out to be a lot higher than Cv. Dr. Mayer thought 
about this and concluded that he had made a mistake in his experi-
ment. The mistake was the weight of the piston. When he measured Cp 
he had forgotten about the work needed to raise the heavy piston. 
Some of the heat generated by the burning wax was being converted to 
work to raise the heavy piston (work equals foot-pounds).
So Dr. Mayer repeated his experiment. He made the piston so 
light that its weight could be neglected. This helped, but still, Cp—
now known as the specific heat of air at constant pressure—persisted 
in being about 40 percent larger than Cv. He reasoned that the expand-
ing air must still be doing work and, therefore, converting some of 
the heat from the candle into work. But if the piston no longer had 
any significant weight, what sort of work could the expanding air be 
doing? Dr. Mayer’s answer to this question changed history.
The expanding air was doing compression work. But what was 
being compressed? Not the air inside the cylinder, which, according 
to Dr. Mayer, was doing the work. This air was kept at a constant 
pressure. Certainly, this air was not being compressed. No, dear 
reader, Dr. Mayer said that it was the air outside the cylinder that was 
being compressed. In other words, all the other molecules in the sea 
of air surrounding our planet were pushed a little closer together by 
the expanding air in the cylinder.
Or, the air, which expands on heating, does work on its surround-
ing environment. But if we heat the air and don’t allow it to expand, 

	
532	
C h a p t e r  F o r t y
it cannot do any work on its environment. Let’s just stop for a moment 
and give all these words some real teeth.
Let’s say I allow air to expand, but I do not supply it with any 
extra heat from an outside source. The air is expanding because I am 
allowing it to push away a piston in a cylinder. What do you think 
happens to the temperature of this expanding air? Isn’t it true that 
whenever a gas (like air and natural gas) expands, it gets colder?
40.2  Compression Work (Cp - Cv)
The specific heat at constant pressure (i.e., Cp) is a measure of the 
amount of heat we put into the air, trapped inside the cylinder as 
shown in Fig. 40.1. Some of this heat is used to increase the tempera-
ture of the trapped air by 1°F. The rest of the heat goes into the work 
required to force the piston up and hence compressing the air sur-
rounding the planet Earth.
The specific heat at constant volume (i.e., Cv) is a measure of the 
amount of heat we put into the air trapped inside the cylinder. All this 
heat goes to increasing the temperature of the trapped air by 1°F. 
None of the heat goes into compression work, because the piston 
remains fixed.
The difference between Cp and Cv is then compression work:
	
Work = Cp - Cv	
How can we determine how much work is being done? There are 
two ways to calculate the amount of compression work that the pis-
ton is doing on the atmosphere of air surrounding the planet:
Method 1.  Take the pounds of wax burned when Cp was measured. 
Then take the pounds of wax burned when Cv was measured. Find 
the difference between the two weights of wax. Burning 1 pound 
of wax generates about 18,000 Btu/lb. Let’s say we burned 8 lb of 
wax when measuring Cp. We burned 6 lb of wax when measuring 
Cv. The amount of heat that has then gone into work is
	
(8 lb − 6 lb) × 18,000 = 36,000 Btu	
or
	
Cp - Cv = work	
We currently know that 1 Btu is equal to 740 ft-lb worth of work.
Therefore, the work performed by the expanding air equals
740 × 36,000 = 26,700,000 ft-lb
If none of this work was wasted, we could use it to lift a 1000-lb 
rock up to the top of Mount Everest (which is about 26,000 ft high). 
But in the 1840s, Julius Robert Mayer did not know the conversion 

	
G a s  C o m p r e s s i o n :  T h e  B a s i c  I d e a 	
533
factor of heat equivalent to work of 740 ft-lb per Btu. It had not 
been determined because Dr. Mayer was the one who first discov-
ered it. So Dr. Mayer had to use the following method.
Method 2.  Let’s say the diameter of the piston in Fig. 40.1 was 
40 ft. The area of such a piston is 1256 ft2. The burning wax is 
causing the weightless piston to be pushed up 100 ft by the air, 
as it is heated and expands. The piston is being pushed up against 
an atmospheric pressure of 14.7 psia. Let us remember that there 
are 144 inches2 in a square foot. So that I can say that atmospheric 
pressure is actually
	
14.7 × 144 = 2117 lb/ft2	
  The total force of the atmospheric pressure pressing down on 
my piston is then
	
2117 lb/ft2 × 1256 ft2 = 267,000 lb of force	
Well, work equals force times distance. The piston is traveling a 
distance of 100 ft. Therefore, the work done by the expanding air is
100 ft × 267,000 lb = 26,700,000 ft-lb
Distance × force = work
Dr. Mayer used our second method. He knew that the heat of 
combustion of 2 lb of wax was 36,000 Btu. He divided
	
26,700,000 ft-lb
36,000 Btu
740 ft-lb

=
	
to obtain the heat equivalent of work. It would be impossible today to 
design an industrial process unit without knowing this fact.
The difference Cp − Cv is proportional to the amount of work the 
piston could perform when supplied with a total amount of heat, pro-
portional to Cp. Then the ratio

K = Cp/Cv
There is another, nonmathematical, way to think about the differ-
ence between Cp and Cv. To extract work from any process requires an 
energy input, like burning wax. Some of this energy will be extracted as 
work (Cp - Cv). But most of this energy input will wind up as heat (Cv).
This is the nasty, but inescapable, lesson learned from the Second 
Law of Thermodynamics, which is derived from Julius Robert Mayer’s 
work. A few examples will suffice to close this chapter:
• A modern car engine converts about 12 to 15 percent of the 
energy in the gasoline to shaft horsepower extracted from 
the engine.
• The most efficient engine ever made is the Rolls-Royce high-
bypass jet engine that we see on commercial aircraft. This 
engine converts about 39 percent of the energy in the jet fuel 
(which is kerosene) to thrust.
• A modern power station converts about 30 percent of the 
energy in the fuel burned to exported electrical energy.
• The ratio of (Cp - Cv)/Cp for air is about 30 percent.

Centrifugal 
Compressors

Overamping the Motor Driver

ave you ever heard a 12,000-hp, 9000-rpm, multistage centrif-
ugal compressor go into surge? The periodic, deep-throated 
roar emitted by the surging compressor is just plain scary. 
Machines, quite obviously, are not intended to make such sounds. But 
what causes surge? 
Another question: What happens to the amperage load on a 
motor-driven centrifugal compressor when the molecular weight of 
the gas increases? I ask this question in the following context:
• The compressor is a fixed-speed machine, as shown in Fig. 41.1.
• The suction pressure P1 is constant.
• The discharge pressure P2 is constant.
• The number of moles of gas compressed or the standard cubic 
feet per hour (SCFH) is constant.
• The suction temperature is constant.
We ought to be able to answer this question with Julius Robert 
Mayer’s equation—also called the Second Law of Thermodynamics 
(see Chap. 40), which states that motor amperage (or electrical work) 
is proportional to

K = ratio of the specific heats, Cp/Cv
We will assume that over the ranges of molecular weights we are 
working with that the ratio of the specific heats K is constant. This is 
not quite true, but this approximation will not invalidate the following 
statement: According to the Second Law of Thermodynamics, as the molec-
ular weight of the gas compressed increases, the amperage (amp) load on the 
motor should remain constant.
The only problem with this statement is that it contradicts reality. 
When we actually increase the molecular weight of a gas, the amp load 
on the centrifugal wet-gas compressor shown in Fig. 41.1 does increase. 
This seems to contradict the Second Law of Thermodynamics. But the 
Second Law has never been shown to be wrong. So we have a conflict. 
Our experience tells us that the amp load on the motor must increase 
as the molecular weight of the gas increases. But the Second Law of 
Thermodynamics tells us that the amp load on the motor must remain 
the same as the molecular weight of the gas increases.
The resolution of this conflict between theory and practice, and the 
question “What causes surge?” will require the rest of this chapter to 
answer.

41.1  Centrifugal Compression and Surge
41.1.1  Mechanically, What Is Surge?
What is actually happening inside a compressor when it begins to 
make that surging sound? Let us refer to Fig. 41.2. When a compressor 
starts to surge, the gas flows backward through the rotating assembly 
(i.e., the rotor). This reversal of flow pushes the rotor backward. The 
rotor slides backward along its radial bearings. The radial bearings 
support the weight of the rotor.
The end of the rotor’s shaft now slams into the thrust bearing. The 
thrust bearing constrains the axial (i.e., horizontal) movement of the 
rotor. Each time you hear the compressor surge, the rotor is making 
one round trip across its radial bearings. Each time the rotor surges, 
the force of the end of the shaft impacting the thrust bearing causes the 
thrust bearing to deform. As the thrust bearing deforms, the axial 
movement of the rotor increases. The spinning wheels of the rotor 
come closer and closer to the stationary elements (called the labyrinth 
seals) of the compressor, which are fixed inside the compressor case.
When a spinning wheel (with a wheel tip velocity of perhaps 
600 miles an hour) touches a stationary element, the compressor 
internals are wrecked. Pieces of the wheel have been known to tear 
through the compressor case and kill operators. Older (1960s), lower-
speed compressors seem to withstand the destructive forces of surge 
better than do newer, higher-speed models.
41.1.2  How Do Centrifugal Compressors Work?
Centrifugal compressors and centrifugal pumps work on the same 
principle. If you have neglected to read Chap. 34, “Centrifugal Pumps: 
Fundamentals of Operation,” this would be a good time to read it. 
Both centrifugal compressors and centrifugal pumps are dynamic 
machines, meaning that they convert velocity into feet of head.

The gas enters the compressor’s rotor through the large wheel 
shown in Fig. 41.2. The purpose of this wheel is to increase the veloc-
ity or kinetic energy of the gas. After the high-velocity gas escapes 
from the vanes in the wheel, the gas enters the stationary elements 
fixed to the inner wall of the compressor case. This is called the stator. 
Inside the stator, the velocity or kinetic energy of the gas is converted 
to polytropic feet of head, or potential energy.
Brave reader, do not be afraid of the term polytropic feet of head. It 
really has the same simple meaning as described in Chap. 34, except 
the term polytropic feet of head means feet of head for a compressible 
fluid that is changing temperature.
To convert from polytropic feet of head to DP, which is really what 
process people are interested in, we use the following very rough 
approximation:
	
DP ≈ DV ⋅ Hp 
(41.1)
where DP = discharge pressure minus the suction pressure
	
DV = density of the vapor at the suction of the compressor
	
Hp = polytropic feet of head
Centrifugal compressors operate on a curve, just like centrifugal 
pumps. A typical curve is shown in Fig. 41.3. The horizontal axis is 
actual cubic feet per minute (ACFM). This is analogous to GPM, used 
on the horizontal (x) axis of centrifugal pump curves. The vertical 
axis is Hp (polytropic feet of head). This is analogous to the feet of 
head used on the vertical ( y) axis of the centrifugal pump curve.
The centrifugal compressor, unless it is dirty or mechanically defec-
tive, has to operate on its curve. As the compressor discharge pressure 
increases, then Hp, the feet of polytropic head required, must also 
increase. Also, as can be seen from the compressor curve, the volume of 
gas compressed (ACFM) must decrease. When the volume of gas drops 
below a critical flow, the compressor will be backed up to its surge point.

Figure 41.3 is similar to a centrifugal pump performance curve in 
regard to its shape. That is, it has a relatively flat portion of its curve 
and a relatively steep portion of its curve:
•	 Flat portion—That’s the front portion of the curve. The 
important characteristic of the flat part of the curve is that a 
large reduction in flow produces a small increase in head. 
This means that an operating change that forces the compres-
sor back up its curve will reduce the driver horsepower. Later 
in this chapter, you will see how critical this bit of information 
is. Most constant speed centrifugal compressors are designed 
to operate on the flat portion of their curves.
•	 Steep portion—That’s the back portion of the curve, where a 
small reduction in flow produces a large increase in head. This 
means that an operating change that forces the compressor 
back up its curve will increase the driver horsepower.
When I describe how to save compressor horsepower by suction 
throttling later in this chapter, you will understand the importance of 
the shape of the performance curve. The concept of the suction throt-
tle valve, in fixed-speed centrifugal compressors, is the least under-
stood aspect of all process equipment.
41.1.3  Aerodynamic Stall
In my younger days, I used to try to meet women on airplanes. Find-
ing myself seated next to an interesting lady, I would ask, “Have you 
ever wondered what makes this plane fly?” With this opening gambit, 
I would then explain:
This sketch (Fig. 41.4) is a cross-section of the wing. Because of the shape of 
the wing, the air has to travel a longer distance across the top of the wing than 
underneath the wing. This means that the velocity of the air as it travels across the 
top of the wing is greater than the velocity of the air as it travels underneath the 
wing. The energy to increase the velocity, or kinetic energy of the air as it flows 
across the top of the wing, does not come from the plane’s engine. This energy

to accelerate the air comes from the air itself; that is, the increase in the kinetic 
energy of the air flowing across the top of the wing comes from the barometric 
pressure of the air.
  It follows, then, that the pressure on top of the wing (shown in Fig. 41.4) is less 
than the pressure underneath the wing. This difference in pressure, multiplied 
by area of the wing, is called lift.
  As the plane’s air speed is reduced, its ability to maintain a lift equal to its weight 
is reduced. At some reduced speed, the plane’s lift then becomes insufficient to 
keep it flying. The aircraft undergoes aerodynamic stall. The plane falls out of the 
sky, crashes, and all the passengers are killed.
At this point, the young lady whom I was trying to impress would 
typically pick up a magazine and ignore me for the rest of the journey.
Surge is quite similar to aerodynamic stall. Of course, when a 
compressor surges, its rotor does not stop spinning. The rotor is spun 
by the motor. But when the flow of gas through the rotor falls below 
a certain rate, the forward velocity of the gas stops. With no flow, 
there is no velocity to convert to feet of head. Then the DP developed 
by the compressor falls to zero.
The discharge pressure of the compressor shown in Fig. 41.1 is 
100 psig and its suction pressure is 10 psig. The gas flow, when the 
compressor surges, travels backward. The reverse gas flow pushes the 
rotor backward and slams it up against its thrust bearing. The suction 
pressure of the compressor increases and its discharge pressure 
decreases. Temporarily, the DP required to push the gas from the wet-gas 
drum and into the absorber shown in Fig. 41.1 is reduced. The poly-
tropic head requirement is thus also temporarily reduced. The compres-
sor may then run out on its performance curve, as it moves a greater 
ACFM volume, and moves away from surge. But in so doing, the com-
pressor lowers its own suction pressure, raises its own discharge pres-
sure, and creates the conditions for the next destructive surge.
41.1.4  Required DP
Movement of the gas from the wet-gas drum into the absorber 
requires a certain DP. According to Eq. (41.1)
DP ≈ (vapor density) × (polytropic head)
We can increase DP by either of the following options: raise the 
density of the vapor or raise the feet of polytropic head, developed by 
the compressor.
To raise the density of the gas, we could
• Raise the compressor’s suction pressure
• Increase the molecular weight of the gas
• Decrease the temperature of the gas
We cannot change the density of the gas by altering the mechanical 
characteristics of the compressor.

	
C e n t r i f u g a l  C o m p r e s s o r s  a n d  S u r g e 	
541
To raise Hp, the feet of polytropic head, we could
• Increase the number of wheels on the rotor shown in Fig. 41.2
• Increase the diameter of the wheels
• Increase the speed of the rotor
We cannot change the feet of head developed by the compressor by 
altering the physical properties of the gas compressed.
Vapor density and feet of head are not related. But if the product 
of the two numbers does not result in sufficient DP to push the gas 
from the drum into the absorber, then the gas flow will stop. It will 
stop and then reverse its direction of flow. And that is surge.
41.1.5  Too Much Polytropic Head
You might conclude from my description of surge that the engineer 
needs to be cautious when designing a new compressor so that it will 
not surge. For example, let’s assume that Jane has to issue the specifi-
cations for a new wet-gas centrifugal compressor. She checks with 
John, the unit engineer, for the proper molecular weight of the gas. 
John tells Jane that the molecular weight of the gas is normally 30, but 
it can be as low as 24—that is, the density of the gas can, on occasion, 
be 20 percent lower than normal.
Jane concludes that the lower-density gas will require more feet of 
polytropic head to develop the required DP. To avoid the possibility of 
surge, she decides to increase the number of wheels on the compressor 
from five to six. While Jane has used good engineering judgment, she has 
made a serious error. It turns out that John should not have been trusted. 
The actual molecular weight of the gas turns out not to be 24 or 30, but 
36. The gas is 50 percent more dense than Jane’s design specifications.
Poor Jane! The compressor’s motor driver now trips off on high 
amps! In her efforts to avoid surge, she has run afoul of the real-world 
fact, that the motor amps required to drive a centrifugal compressor 
are approximately proportional to the molecular weight of the gas—
in apparent contradiction to the Second Law of Thermodynamics.
I hope that you can now see the intimate relationship between 
surge in a centrifugal compressor and the amperage load on the motor 
used to drive the compressor. But let’s see if I can prove that the Second 
Law of Thermodynamics is in harmony with our practical experience.
41.1.6  Effect of Molecular Weight on DP
Let us refer again to Fig. 41.1. Suddenly, there is an increase in the molec-
ular weight of the wet gas. This causes the density of the gas to increase. 
This results in an increase of the compressor DP. As the compressor DP 
increases, the compressor’s suction pressure decreases. Why? If the dis-
charge pressure is kept constant by the absorber back-pressure control 
valve, then a bigger DP must drag down the suction pressure. The 
reduced suction pressure increases the suction volume (ACFM) of gas 

	
542	
C h a p t e r  F o r t y - O n e
flowing to the compressor. Why? Because a lower-pressure gas occupies 
a larger volume.
As the ACFM increases, we run out to the right on the compressor 
curve, shown in Fig. 41.3. As we move away from the surge point, the 
polytropic feet of head decreases. As the polytropic feet of head is 
reduced, the compressor DP comes partially back down to its initial 
value, until a new equilibrium is established. But because the initial dis-
turbance of the equilibrium—the increased molecular weight—moved 
us away from surge, the new equilibrium will be established farther 
away from surge than the initial equilibrium. Not only will the new equi-
librium be established farther away from surge, but the pressure in the 
wet-gas drum will wind up lower than the initial pressure in the drum.
Let’s now assume that there is a sudden decrease in the molecular 
weight of the wet gas. This results in a decrease in the gas density. 
The DP developed by the compressor goes down. As a consequence, 
the compressor’s suction pressure rises. This reduces the ACFM vol-
ume of gas flowing into the compressor. As the ACFM decreases, 
we back up on the compressor curve toward the surge point. As we 
move closer to surge, the polytropic feet of head developed increases. 
The compressor DP comes partly back up to its initial value, until a 
new equilibrium is established. But because the initial disturbance—
the decreased molecular weight—moved us toward surge, the new 
equilibrium will be established closer to surge than the initial equilib-
rium. Also, the pressure in the wet-gas drum will wind up higher 
than the initial equilibrium pressure in that drum.
41.2  Compressor Efficiency
41.2.1  Maintaining a Constant Suction Drum Pressure
In the two examples we have just discussed, P1, the compressor suction 
pressure, was not being held constant. In fact, when the molecular 
weight of the gas increased, P1, the suction pressure, went down. Let 
me now rewrite Robert Mayer’s equation, which I presented at the 
start of this chapter:

(41.2)
This simplified version assumes that K (the Cp/Cv ratio) is a con-
stant of 1.3; that T1, the suction temperature, is constant; and that the 
compression work is proportional to the motor amps (N is the num-
ber of moles of gas flowing into the compressor). (The K value of air 
and hydrogen at room temperature is 1.4. For CO2, K is 1.3. For ethane 
and heavier hydrocarbons, K gets progressively smaller, as the molec-
ular weight increases. Methane is 1.31. Ethane is 1.22. K gets bigger as

temperature increases. Meaning the hotter and lighter the gas, the 
more difficult it is to compress.) From Eq. (41.2), note that a reduction 
in the suction pressure, P1, will cause the motor’s amp load to increase.
But I said at the start of this chapter that I assumed that P1 was to 
remain constant. Well, I made an impossible assumption. Because of 
the dynamic nature of the centrifugal compressor, it is simply impos-
sible to permit the molecular weight of a gas to vary, and then state 
that none of the following parameters may change:
• Suction pressure, P1
• Discharge pressure, P2
• Number of moles, N
• Speed of the compressor
As the molecular weight goes up, P1 goes down, the compression 
ratio (P2/P1) increases, and so does the work needed to drive the 
compressor. And the apparent contradiction between Dr. Mayer’s 
equation and our plant experience is resolved.
But suppose we must maintain a constant pressure in the wet-gas 
drum. The pressure in this drum may be controlling the pressure in 
an upstream distillation column. To hold a constant pressure in the 
drum, we will have to resort to spillback suction pressure control, 
illustrated in Fig. 41.5.

Again, let’s assume that there is a sudden increase in the molecu-
lar weight of the gas. Again, the gas density increases. The DP devel-
oped by the compressor rises. The pressure in the wet-gas drum 
drops. The spillback pressure-control (PC) valve starts to open. The 
number of moles, N, flowing to the compressor increases. The ACFM 
also increases. The compressor now runs out on its operating curve 
(Fig. 41.3) to the right, away from surge. The polytropic feet of head 
Hp drops. The DP is brought back down to its initial value. This keeps 
both the compressor suction pressure and the pressure in the wet-
gas drum constant.
Great. But what about Dr. Mayer? What about Eq. (41.2)? It is true 
that the compression ratio (P2/P1) has been held constant. But as the 
molecular weight has increased, the number of moles N has also 
increased. Why? Because, the spillback valve has opened. And as N 
increases, so does the amperage drawn by the motor.
Why, then, in ordinary process plant practice, do we see an increase 
in the amps on a motor driving a centrifugal compressor as the gas 
becomes heavier? Does it take more work to compress a mole of pro-
pane (44 MW [molecular weight]) than it does to compress a mole of 
methane (16 MW)? Certainly not. It’s just that compressing a heavier 
gas forces the spillback to open to prevent the pressure from falling in 
the wet-gas drum. This extra gas recirculating through the compressor 
is the real factor that increases the amp load on the motor driver.
41.2.2  Variable-Speed Driver
Wouldn’t it be simpler to just slow down the compressor as the 
molecular weight increases? After all, it seems as if we need less feet 
of head when the gas density increases to maintain a given ΔP. As we 
slow the compressor by 10 percent, the feet of polytropic head would 
drop by 20 percent. Fine. But 99 percent of motor-driven compressors 
are fixed-speed machines.
Does this mean that we would be better off driving a large cen-
trifugal compressor with a variable-speed driver? Perhaps with a 
steam turbine or gas-fired turbine. You bet! Especially when the 
molecular weight is highly variable.
41.2.3  What about Jane?
I hope you all understand the mistake Jane made. She trusted John. 
But if she had it all to do over again, what could Jane have done 
differently? She has to drive the compressor by a fixed-speed 
motor. The gas molecular weight is going to be unpredictable. The 
pressure in the wet-gas drum has to be kept constant.
Figure 41.6 is a partial answer to the problem of excessive power 
demand on the compressor’s motor driver. We use the suction throttle 
valve (i.e., the “PC,” control valve) shown in this figure. The use of 
the compressor suction throttle valve will partly offset the increase in 
the amp load on the compressor’s motor driver, which results from 

	
C e n t r i f u g a l  C o m p r e s s o r s  a n d  S u r g e 	
545
an increase in the molecular weight of the wet-gas flow to the com-
pressor. As I will explain below, the beneficial effects of suction throt-
tling are a function of the shape of the compressor’s performance 
curve. As long as the compressor is operating on the flat portion of its 
curve (see Fig. 41.3), suction throttling helps. If the compressor is 
operating on the steep portion of its curve (which is not normal), suc-
tion throttling will not help to reduce the amperage load on the 
driver.
If the molecular weight of the gas increases, the gas density will 
increase. The P will increase. The pressure in the wet-gas drum  
will drop. The new suction throttle PC valve will start to close. This 
will restore the pressure in the wet-gas drum without increasing the 
flow of gas through the spillback valve. But what happens to P1? How 
does closing the suction throttle valve affect the actual compressor 
suction pressure?
Gentle reader, take a break. You are up to the hardest part of this 
book. Have a Coke, and we will continue.
41.2.4  Damming the River Yeo
The River Yeo is a gentle stream that meanders through western 
England. In the seventeenth century, the river was used to move 
coal-laden barges. But near the town of Yeovil, the river became too 
shallow for deep draft barges to negotiate. So a dam was proposed.

This would raise the height of water upstream of the dam, as shown 
in Fig. 41.7.
The farmers downstream of the dam were concerned that the river 
flowing through their fields would run dry. The engineer who designed 
the dam assured them that this would not happen. Certainly, at first the 
flow of water downstream of the dam would be just a trickle. But after 
a few months, when a new equilibrium was established, water would 
begin overflowing the dam at the same rate that water formerly flowed 
down river. The level of the river downstream of the dam would then be 
the same as it had been before the dam existed.
The suction throttle valve, shown in Fig. 41.6, is analogous to the 
dam on the River Yeo. When we close this valve, the pressure in the wet-
gas drum will increase. But the pressure at P1, the compressor suction 
pressure, at equilibrium is completely unaffected by the movement of 
the suction throttle valve.
For example, let’s say that the molecular weight of the gas 
increases by 20 percent. The DP developed by the compressor would 
then increase by 20 percent, from 90 to 108 psi. If the absorber pres-
sure is fixed, then the wet-gas drum pressure would drop by 18 psi. 
To prevent this excessive decrease in the drum pressure, we throttle 
on the suction PC control valve. The pressure drop through this valve 
would increase by 18 psi. But the pressure at P1 will drop by 18 psi, 
just as if we never moved the suction throttle valve.
Controlling the pressure in the drum by suction throttling allows 
the compression ratio P2/P1 to increase in response to an increase in 
the molecular weight of the gas. As the compression ratio increases, 
according to Eq. (41.2), the amperage on the motor driver also 
increases. But not by a lot.
According to Eq. (41.2), the compression ratio is raised to a small 
fractional exponent (viz., 0.23). So even if the compression ratio goes 
up a lot, the amp load on the motor driver will increase by very little.
The main reason, however, that suction throttling reduces the 
amp load on the motor driver is due to the shape of the compressor 
performance curve (see Fig. 41.3). If we are operating on the flat por-
tion of the curve, suction throttling will have the following effect:
•	 Flow will go down a lot.
•	 Delta P (or polytropic head) will go up just a little.

547
Meaning, suction throttling just a bit causes the spillback valve to 
throttle back a lot. Or, N, the number of moles of gas compressed, will 
drop a lot, but P2/P1, the compression ratio, will increase just a little. 
As we normally operate on the flat portion of the compressor curve, 
suction throttling will reduce the amp load on the driver. If, however, 
we were operating on the steep portion of the compressor curve, suc-
tion throttling could increase the amp load on the motor driver.
To summarize, suction throttling moves us closer to surge, but 
saves energy by forcing the spillback valve to close.
Of course, we may also control the wet-gas drum pressure very 
nicely by the spillback PC valve, shown in Fig. 41.5. But this mode of 
control causes N, the number of moles in Eq. (41.2), to rapidly increase. 
And the motor amps will increase about as fast as the number of moles.
The useful rule of thumb is then
• When the molecular weight rises, the motor amps must increase.
• If the molecular weight rises by 20 percent and we control the 
drum pressure by spillback control, the motor amps will 
increase by about 20 percent.
• If the molecular weight rises by 20 percent and we control the 
drum pressure by suction throttle control, the motor amps 
will increase by about 10 percent.
41.2.4.1  Stone walling
Surge is bad and will eventually damage a compressor’s rotor and 
case internals. Stone walling sounds equally bad, but it is not. Operat-
ing in a stone walling mode simply means you have reduced the 
compressor’s discharge pressure to such a great extent that a further 
reduction in discharge pressure will not result in any increase of gas 
flow. Anyone who has operated a centrifugal pump will recognize 
this condition. That is, past some pump discharge valve position, 
opening the valve further will not increase the flow. I like to say that 
you have fallen off the curve.
41.2.5  Saving Electricity
Forget about Jane. Forget about John. At the moment, let’s assume 
that there is nothing wrong with the compressor shown in Fig. 41.6. 
We are operating far away from the surge point, and the motor is 
pulling only 70 percent of its maximum amp load.
Both the suction throttle pressure control (PC) valve and the spill-
back (flow-control [FC]) valve shown in Fig. 41.6 are in a nice operating 
position. All we wish to do is save electricity.
This is done by reducing the set point on the FC valve. As we do this
 
1. The FC valve partly closes.
	
2.	 The number of moles compressed N is reduced.

	
548	
C h a p t e r  F o r t y - O n e
 
3. The volume of gas compressed (ACFM) goes down.
 
4. According to the compressor curve shown in Fig. 41.3, the 
feet of polytropic head Hp increases as the ACFM decreases.
	
5.	 The increased Hp increases the DP developed by the com-
pressor.
	
6.	 This reduces the pressure in the wet-gas drum.
 
7. The PC valve shown in Fig. 41.6 now begins to close, to 
restore the pressure in the wet-gas drum.
The net result of these changes is to reduce N and increase P2/P1. 
Because of the shape of the compressor performance curve, this 
should result in a reduction in the amp load of the motor driver.  
A rough rule of thumb is that for every 10 percent decrease in N, 
the total number of moles compressed, the amp load on the motor 
driver will fall by 5 percent.
But as we reduce N, we are moving toward the surge point in  
Fig. 41.3. If we try to save too much electricity by forcing the FC to 
close too much, then the centrifugal compressor may be forced 
into surge. That is why we call the FC spillback valve the antisurge 
valve.
Notice how the problem of surge and the amp load on the motor 
driver are two ideas that interact together. It is kind of like solving 
two equations with two unknowns. The two objectives we are trying 
to optimize are the motor amps and avoidance of surge. The two han-
dles we have on the problem are the suction throttle valve and the 
spillback valve. And just like solving the two equations, we have to 
optimize the position of the two valves simultaneously.
41.2.6  Suction Temperature
Throughout our discussion of motor-driven, constant-speed cen-
trifugal compressors, I have assumed that the suction temperature 
was constant. But let’s refer back to Fig. 41.1. Assume that the tem-
perature in the drum increases. How will this affect the pressure in 
the drum?
If the increased temperature T1 increases the density of the gas, 
then the DP developed by the compressor will go up, and the drum 
pressure will decline. Let’s assume that the feed to the drum is a 
mixture of
• Ethane
• Propane
• Butane
• Pentane
• Gasoline

	
C e n t r i f u g a l  C o m p r e s s o r s  a n d  S u r g e 	
549
As the drum temperature increases, the heavier components in 
the liquid phase are vaporized into the vapor phase. This increases 
the molecular weight of the vapors and hence the vapor density.
Now, let’s assume that the feed to the drum is a mixture of hydrogen 
and heavy mineral oil.
As the drum temperature increases, the molecular weight of the gas 
remains at about 2, the molecular weight of hydrogen. The mineral oil 
is too heavy to vaporize. The density of the vapor goes down, because 
the vapor is hotter. The drum pressure then increases.
41.2.7  Sulfur Plant Air Blower
Here is a problem that came up on a sulfur recovery facility in Punto 
Fijo, Venezuela. The combustion air blower, shown in Fig. 41.8, was a 
fixed-speed, motor-driven centrifugal machine. The air intake filters 
were severely fouled. They had a pressure drop of about 8 inches of 
H2O. The atmospheric vent valve, used to control the discharge pres-
sure at a constant 12 psig, was 50 percent open. The unit engineer had 
been asked to calculate the incentive in electrical power savings for 
cleaning the filters.
Cleaning the filters would have raised the suction pressure to the 
blower. This would have reduced the blower’s compression ratio. But 
because the blower is a fixed-speed centrifugal compressor, the amount 
of air compressed N would have increased. The atmospheric vent dis-
charge valve would have been forced open. The greater volume of air 
compressed would have caused the compressor to work harder, even 
though the compression ratio (P2/P1) was lower. In conclusion, clean-
ing the filters would have increased the amps drawn by the motor.
To prove my point, I slid a piece of plywood across one filter. The 
PC vent valve, shown in Fig. 41.8, began to close, and the amps drawn 
by the motor driver went down!

41.2.8  Centrifugal Compressor Check Valves  
and Surge Protection
A motor-driven centrifugal compressor may be forced into surge due 
to a combination of several factors:
•	 Excessive suction temperature
•	 Low molecular weight
•	 Excessive discharge pressure
•	 Low flow
•	 Suction pressure too low
•	 Low polytropic head due to defective or fouled rotor wheels
When the compressor surges, gas flow stops. However, as the 
compressor discharge pressure will still be high, the gas flows 
backward through the wheels of the compressor case. The momen-
tum of this reverse gas flow pushes the rotor backward. The check 
valve on the compressor discharge greatly retards the force of this 
reverse gas flow.
On my sulfuric acid alkylation unit refrigeration compressor, 
which I operated from 1974 through 1976 in Texas City, I found the 
horrible banging sound of this check valve to be the most worrying 
aspect of a surge. Each violent bang frightened me. However, what I 
failed to recognize at the time was that it was the violent closing of 
the check valve that protected my alkylation unit refrigeration com-
pressor from destruction due to the surging.
In general I have found that compressors operate at:
•	 Low speed, less than 3600 rpm (three-phase motor speed)
•	 Low overall compression ratios (less than 2 or 3 to 1)
•	 Reasonably high molecular weights (30 to 40 or higher)
Such machines can operate for many minutes (but not hours) in 
a surging mode without sustaining noticeable mechanical damage 
to the rotor, if there is a check valve on the compressor’s discharge.
However, keep the following potential problem in mind. This 
incident occurred at a plant in South Africa on a catalyst regeneration 
recycle gas compressor.
•	 The operators closed the discharge to the suction recycle valve, 
which reduced the flow and raised the discharge pressure.
•	 The machine started to surge.
•	 The reversal of gas flow raised the suction temperature, 
which caused the motor driver to automatically trip-off on 
high temperature for surge protection.

	
C e n t r i f u g a l  C o m p r e s s o r s  a n d  S u r g e

•	 The primary lube oil pump for the bearings was driven by 
the shaft of the recycle gas compressor. So it shut-down with 
the compressor.
•	 But the backup lube oil pump, which was supposed to start 
automatically on low lube oil pressure to the bearings, failed 
to start up on auto.
•	 With a loss of lube oil pressure to the bearings, the bearings 
were rapidly damaged, and the resulting vibrations destroyed 
the gas compressor.
The plant supervisor claimed that the destruction was due to 
surge. This was not true. The destruction was due to the supervisor 
failing to verify that his backup lube oil pump would start up on 
auto, on low lube oil pressure to the bearings. (See Troubleshooting 
Process Plant Control, Wiley, 2009 for details as to how this is done.)
41.3  Frequently Asked Questions  
about Centrifugal Compressors
Many of the questions I receive from students pertain to centrifugal 
compressor operations. I’ve summarized the more frequently asked 
questions and answers below (refer to Fig. 41.9):
Q:  What causes surge?
A:  Due to low gas molecular weight, or too high a delta P required, 
or too high gas temperature, the compressor head requirement 
gets too high for the gas to be pushed through the compressor 
case by the spinning rotor. The gas flow then stops and reverses.
Q:  What’s stone walling?
A:  Reducing the discharge pressure does not increase flow.
Q:  Is stone walling damaging to compressors?
A:  No.
Q:  Is surge damaging to compressors?
A:  Yes. Each surge deforms the thrust bearing.
Q:  Does suction throttling save energy?
A:  If you are operating (see Fig. 41.9) in the normal range of the 
compressor, that is, on the flatter portion of the performance curve, 
suction throttling will save energy because flow will be reduced 
faster than head goes up. But, if you are operating on the steep 
part of the curve, suction throttling can waste energy because head 
goes up faster than flow goes down. The real effect of suction 
throttling can only be predicted by looking at the compressor per-
formance curve.

	
552	
C h a p t e r  F o r t y - O n e
Q:  Opening up the spillback on my compressor has caused it to 
surge. I thought that should prevent surging?
A:  You’re spilling back hot gas from the compressor discharge. 
This lowers the gas density. Any factor that lowers gas density 
will promote surging.
Q:  If a turbine driven compressor starts to surge, should I make 
it go faster or slower?
A:  There’s no general answer. You need to look at your compressor 
surge vs. speed curves. See what happens as you change speed as 
to whether or not you are closer to the surge point. On my sulfur 
plant air blower in Texas City, depending on operating conditions, 
I could cause the blower to surge by increasing or decreasing speed.

CHAPTER 42
Reciprocating 
Compressors
The Carnot Cycle; 
Use of Indicator Card
C
entrifugal compressors are dynamic machines. They convert 
velocity, imparted to the gas by a spinning wheel, to poly-
tropic feet of head. The feet of head multiplied by the den-
sity of the gas equals the pressure boost produced by the centrifugal 
compressor.
A reciprocating compressor is a direct volume-reduction machine. 
The gas is simply squeezed out of a cylinder by a piston and pushed 
into the discharge line. The molecular weight of the gas does not 
influence the suction or discharge pressure of the compressor. The 
gas density does not influence the compressor performance or the 
work required by the driver.
The reciprocating compressor is a positive-displacement compres-
sor. It is cheaper to purchase and install than a centrifugal compressor. 
It is also—in theory—far more efficient (90 percent) than a centrifugal 
compressor (70 percent). Certainly, reciprocating compressors are more 
simple to understand and engineer than centrifugal machines. Best of 
all, they are not subject to surge.
There are only two real problems with reciprocating compressors: 
pulsation and mechanical reliability. But these problems are so intract­
able that, for most industrial applications, centrifugal compressors are 
preferred; the exception is when dealing with low molecular weight 
gas. A low molecular weight gas, such as hydrogen, has a low density. 
Let’s say that a compressor must develop a large differential pressure 
or P. Recall Eq. (41.1) from the previous chapter:
∆P = (gas density) × Hp
where Hp = polytropic feet of head.
553

	
554	
C h a p t e r  F o r t y - T w o
A centrifugal compressor developing a lot of P with a low gas 
density needs to produce a lot of polytropic feet of head. This means 
that the centrifugal compressor must
• Be a high-speed machine
• Have a lot of wheels or stages
• Have large-diameter wheels
The most cost-effective way to produce a high polytropic head is to 
increase the number of wheels on the rotor. But the longer the rotating 
assembly, the more difficult it is to properly balance the rotor. Espe-
cially for high-speed machines, rotors that become unbalanced are sub-
ject to destructive vibration. Therefore, for low molecular weight gas 
services (less than 10), it is common to use reciprocating compressors.
Reciprocating compressors are favored over centrifugal machines 
for temporary installations such as gas field well-head service. Also, 
when low initial capital investment is favored over long-term mainte-
nance costs, reciprocating compressors are often used.
42.1  Theory of Reciprocating Compressor Operation
Figure 42.1 is a simplified sketch of a cylinder of a reciprocating com-
pressor. The cylinder is shown as a single-acting cylinder. Typically 
cylinders are double-acting, meaning that there are valves on both 
ends of the cylinder and that the piston is compressing gas, in turn, 
on both ends of the cylinder.
The far end of the cylinder is called the head end. The end of the 
cylinder nearest the central shaft is called the crank end. I have shown 
the valves only on the head end to simplify my description of the 
compressor’s operation.

555
There are four distinct steps in the compression cycle of the cylin-
der, shown in Fig. 42.1: compression, discharge, expansion, and intake.
42.1.1  Compression
The initial position of the piston is as far from the cylinder head as 
possible. This is the start of the compression stroke. This position is 
called top dead center. The piston now moves toward the cylinder 
head. The pressure of the gas inside the cylinder increases.
42.1.2  Discharge
At some point, as the piston approaches the cylinder head, the gas 
pressure inside the cylinder exceeds the pressure in the discharge 
line. The discharge valve now springs open, and gas is pushed out of 
the cylinder into the discharge line.
Both the discharge valve and the intake or suction valve are sim-
ply spring-loaded check valves. The discharge valve only permits gas 
to be forced out of the cylinder. The intake valve only permits gas to 
enter the cylinder.
The piston continues its travel toward the cylinder head. At some 
point it stops and reverses its direction. This point is called bottom dead 
center, indicated by the dotted line in Fig. 42.1. Of course, bottom dead 
center cannot coincide with the end of the cylinder. The piston would 
have to travel past the valve ports for this to occur. If the piston travels 
past the discharge port, the compressed gas could not be pushed out of 
the cylinder into the discharge line. So bottom dead center must line up 
near the crank-end edge of the valve ports, as shown in Fig. 42.1.
This means that a substantial volume of gas remains trapped 
between the cylinder head and the piston before the travel of the piston 
is reversed. This volume of gas is called the starting volumetric clearance. 
It determines the volumetric efficiency of the reciprocating compressor. 
We will discuss this later.
42.1.3  Expansion
As soon as the piston reverses its direction of travel, the pressure of 
the gas inside the cylinder drops. The gas pressure drops below the 
discharge line pressure, and the spring-loaded discharge valve slams 
shut. The piston continues its travel toward the crank end of the cyl-
inder. The pressure of the gas inside the cylinder continues to fall, but 
the suction or intake valve remains closed.
42.1.4  Intake
At some point, as the piston approaches the crank end, the gas pres-
sure inside the cylinder falls below the pressure in the suction line. 
The suction, or intake, valve now springs open, and gas is drawn out 
of the suction line and into the cylinder. This portion of the intake 
stroke continues until the piston returns to top dead center.

	
556	
C h a p t e r  F o r t y - T w o
42.2  The Carnot Cycle
The piston has now completed its cycle. I have drawn a picture of this 
cycle in Fig. 42.2. I have plotted the pressure inside the cylinder against 
the volume of the gas inside the cylinder. The “gas inside the cylinder” 
refers to the gas between the piston and the cylinder head.
Beginning at top dead center:
	
1.	 The gas is compressed up to the discharge pressure.
	
2.	 The gas is pushed out into the discharge line at a pressure 
equal to the discharge-line pressure.
	
3.	 The piston reaches bottom dead center and reverses its direction.
	
4.	 The gas left in the end of the cylinder expands—and depres-
surizes—until the suction-line pressure is reached.
	
5.	 New gas is taken into the cylinder until the piston returns to 
top dead center.
At any point in this cycle, there is a pressure inside the cylinder 
that corresponds to the volume of gas inside the cylinder. That is all 
the Carnot cycle chart, drawn in Fig. 42.2, means.
Professor Nicolas L. S. Carnot, in the late nineteenth century, real-
ized that the area inside the plot of pressure vs. volume represented 
the work needed to compress gas in a reciprocating compressor. In 
other words, the change of pressure multiplied by the change in volume 
is equal to the work done by the piston on the gas. Professor Carnot

called this PV (pressure vs. volume) work. He then used calculus to 
sum up the area inside the lines shown in Fig. 42.2. The total area is 
now called ideal compression work.
What’s wrong with Carnot’s theory? I have nothing against Professor 
Carnot personally. I do not hold his French nationality against him. I do 
not dislike French people, even though Liz’s purse was stolen in Paris. 
But I do have several problems with the Carnot cycle:
• Valve leakage
• Spring tension
• Pulsation
The Carnot cycle plot represents ideal compression work. But we  
in the process industry have to worry about actual compression work 
and the loss of compression efficiency caused by these three problems.
We would like to understand the actual compressor cycle, rather 
than the idealized Carnot cycle. We would like to see an actual plot of 
the pressure inside the cylinder, compared to the volume inside the 
cylinder. And there is a way to do this.
42.3  The Indicator Card
The pressure inside the cylinder can be measured with a pressure 
transducer, a device that converts a pressure into an electrical output. 
The pressure transducer screws into the end of the cylinder head. There 
is a screwed plug in the cylinder head for this purpose.
The volume of gas inside the cylinder is a function of the piston 
position. The piston position is a function of the crank shaft position. 
The crank shaft position can be measured by a magnetic pickup 
attached to the crank shaft. Anyone who has had an automobile spark 
plug firing timing adjusted electronically is familiar with this method 
of determining piston position.
The output from the magnetic pickup and the output from the 
pressure transducer are connected to an oscilloscope. After a com-
puter conversion of the data, the resulting pressure/volume plot is 
printed out. This plot is called an indicator card. The indicator card 
shown in Fig. 42.3 was generated from a 4000-hp natural-gas com-
pressor near the town of  Hebron­ville, Texas.
The solid line is the indicator card plot. The dotted line is the Carnot 
or ideal compression work cycle, which I have drawn myself. The piston 
position, shown on the horizontal axis, is proportional to the volume of 
gas inside the cylinder.
The area enclosed by the solid line is the total or actual compression 
work. The area enclosed by the dotted line is ideal or useful compression 
work. The area between the dotted line and the solid line represents 
compression work lost to heat. The area inside the dotted line divided by 
the area inside the solid line is called adiabatic compressor efficiency.

42.3.1  Pulsation Losses
Take a closer look at the discharge portion of the indicator card shown 
in Fig. 42.3. Note that the cylinder internal pressure rises well above 
the discharge-line pressure before gas is pushed out of the cylinder 
and into the discharge line. This is a consequence of the spring ten-
sion of the discharge valves.
In order to force these valves open, a certain amount of extra pres-
sure in the cylinder is needed. The extra pressure overcomes the 
spring tension. Once the valve is open, gas flows out of the cylinder 
into the discharge line, and the cylinder pressure falls. But, as shown 
on the indicator card, the discharge valve apparently opens and 
closes five times during one cycle.
This multiple opening of the discharge valve is called valve pulsa-
tion or “valve flutter.” The peaks on the indicator card caused by this 
pulsation are a source of considerable energy waste. The amplitude 
(i.e., the height of the peaks) is a function of the valve spring tension. 
The frequency of the peaks (i.e., the number of peaks) is a function of 
the speed of the compressor and the geometry of the suction and dis-
charge piping.
We can reduce the amplitude (height) of the peaks by using 
weaker springs in the discharge valve. I tried this at the Hebronville 
compressor station, and it did work. The frequency (number) of 
peaks cannot be altered by any cost-effective method.

When we reduce the spring tension, we prevent the valves from 
closing as tightly as they did with stronger springs. The discharge valves 
are now more prone to leakage. The effect of discharge-valve leakage 
can be seen in the expansion portion of the cycle, shown in Fig. 42.3.
The sudden jumps in pressure are caused by high pressure gas 
blowing back from the discharge line into the cylinder. If the dis-
charge-valve leakage gets bad enough, the amount of gas compressed 
may approach zero. While the amount of actual or total compression 
work may still be quite high, the amount of ideal or useful compres-
sion work may be essentially zero.
42.3.2  Using the Indicator Card
Is it then a good idea to make the discharge-valve springs weaker? 
Weaker springs cut down on pulsation losses, but also increase valve 
leakage losses. If we consult the indicator-card plot, we can see that 
the pulsation losses (for the discharge portion of the cycle) greatly 
exceed the valve leakage losses (for the expansion portion of the 
cycle). It therefore seems that weaker springs probably are a good bet 
to promote greater compressor efficiency.
I could repeat the same story for the intake or suction valves. 
Leakage of the intake valves would appear as peaks on the compres-
sion portion of the cycle. Pulsation losses for the intake valves would 
appear as peaks on the indicator card during the suction or intake 
portion of the cycle.
Other problems that can be identified by use of the indicator card are
• Piston ring leakage
• Excessive valve velocity losses
• Breakup of the valve plates
The indicator card is the only real way to monitor reciprocating-
compressor performance. Typically, the equipment and personnel to 
generate the card can be obtained from a local company specializing in 
this service. Often, the indicator card is referred to as a beta scan plot.
42.4  Volumetric Compressor Efficiency
Reciprocating compressors have two sorts of compressor efficiency:
• Adiabatic
• Volumetric
So far, we have limited our discussion to adiabatic compression 
efficiency. This inefficiency downgrades work to heat. For a given 
compression ratio, the temperature rise of the gas as it flows through 
the compressor may be excessive, thus indicating a low adiabatic com-
pression efficiency. Both centrifugal and reciprocating compressors 
suffer from this common problem, which is the subject of Chap. 43.

	
560	
C h a p t e r  F o r t y - T w o
Volumetric efficiency applies only to reciprocating compressors. 
A reduction in volumetric efficiency reduces the gas flow through the 
compressor. A reduction in volumetric efficiency need not reduce the 
adiabatic compression efficiency.
A reduction in volumetric efficiency reduces the work required 
from the driver. For reciprocating compressors, we intentionally 
reduce the volumetric efficiency to reduce the load on the driver. 
Sometimes this is done to save energy; sometimes it is done to prevent 
the motor driver from tripping off on high amps.
42.5  Unloaders
In the plant, we use the term unloading to indicate various ways of 
reducing the volumetric efficiency of a reciprocating compressor. 
There are two sorts of unloaders:
• Valve disablers
• Head-end clearance pocket adjusters
The proper way to reduce the volumetric efficiency is to increase the 
starting volumetric clearance. This is done with an adjustable unload-
ing pocket, as shown in Fig. 42.4. This device, also called the head-end 
unloader, works by increasing the starting volumetric clearance. The 
starting volumetric clearance is the volume of gas trapped between the 
cylinder head and the piston when the piston position is at bottom dead 
center (see Fig. 42.2).
Turning the wheel at the back end of the cylinder counterclock-
wise pulls back a large internal plug in the head. Now, when the pis-
ton starts to withdraw toward the crank end of the cylinder, there is 
more gas left inside the cylinder to expand. The greater the volume of 
gas inside the cylinder when the piston is at bottom dead center, the 
closer the piston is to top dead center before the intake valve opens.

561
The delay in the opening of the intake valve reduces the amount of 
gas drawn into the cylinder. This reduces the number of moles of gas 
compressed by the piston. Compression work is also diminished, and 
the driver horsepower or motor amp load drops.
42.5.1  Valve Disablers
The head-end unloader has a great advantage in that it unloads the 
driver without increasing the amount of work required per mole of 
gas compressed. The disadvantages of the adjustable clearance 
pocket or head-end unloader, shown in Fig. 42.4, are
• It is an expensive added feature.
• It cannot be used on the crank end of the cylinder.
In practice, the head-end unloader can reduce compression work 
required per cylinder only by roughly 30 percent.
The second way to unload a reciprocating compressor is with 
valve disablers. Most of the unloaders you have on your compressors 
are likely of this inferior type. They typically consist of steel fingers, 
which are pressed down through the valve-cap assembly. The fingers 
prevent the valve plate from moving. These valve disablers are far 
less costly than an adjustable clearance pocket. They may be used on 
both the crank and head ends of the cylinder. They can reduce the gas 
flowing through a cylinder to zero.
Unfortunately, valve disablers have a detrimental effect on the 
adiabatic compressor efficiency. This means that, even though no gas 
may be moving through the crank end of a cylinder, the piston is still 
doing work on the gas inside the crank end of the cylinder. If you 
would like proof, place your hand on the valve cap on such a dis-
abled cylinder. The high temperature you will feel is wasted com-
pression work going to useless heat. I have measured in the field that, 
after a cylinder end is completely disabled, it is still converting  
20 percent of the former compression work to heat.
The other problem with valve disablers is poor mechanical 
reliability. They get stuck inside the valve cap, especially in dirty-
gas service. Once stuck, the valve—and really the entire end of the 
cylinder—is out of service until the next overhaul of the reciprocat-
ing compressor.
42.5.2  Valve Failure
The weak points of a reciprocating compressor are the intake and dis-
charge valves. Valves fail because the movable valve plate or the 
springs break. The cause of failure is usually liquid entering the com-
pressor. Reciprocating compressors do not like liquids. A small, well-
dispersed liquid flow to a centrifugal compressor will help keep its 
rotor clean and does no damage. The same amount of liquid will tear 
up the valves on a reciprocating machine.

	
562	
C h a p t e r  F o r t y - T w o
High temperature also hastens spring failure and plate cracking 
of the discharge valves. The primary cause of high discharge-valve 
temperature is valve leakage. Leaking valves cause part of the gas 
flow to be recompressed by the piston. This extra compression work 
can result in some very hot discharge valves.
Valve leakage is caused by a combination of pulsation and fouling 
deposits. Sulfur, sulfur salts, ammonium chloride, and other volatile 
compounds may all sublime inside the valve assemblies. The word 
sublime means to change directly from a vapor into a solid. Amine 
salts, polymers, oxygen, diolefins, water, and products of corrosion 
also contribute to valve fouling. These deposits accumulate between 
the moving valve plate and the fixed valve slotted face. They prevent 
proper seating of the movable valve plate. This results in valve leak-
age. Centrifugal compressors are far more tolerant of fouling than 
reciprocating compressors.
42.6  Rod Loading
The piston rod used in a reciprocating-compressor cylinder can fail if 
overstressed. The stress experienced by the piston rod is a direct func-
tion of the P developed by the cylinder. That is because on one side 
of the piston, we have the suction pressure, and on the other side of 
the piston, we have the discharge pressure. The P times the area of 
the piston is therefore the force acting on the piston. Excessive force 
will break the piston rod.
The high-discharge-temperature trip on your reciprocating com-
pressor is intended to prevent the piston rod from being overstressed. 
The higher the P, the greater the temperature rise of the compressed 
gas. The compressor manufacturer has calculated the expected tem-
perature rise of the gas for the maximum P to which the piston 
should be exposed. The high-temperature trip is not intended to pro-
tect mechanical components from excessive wear and tear, due to 
high temperature. It is there to protect the machine from the very 
serious consequences of piston-rod failure.
Do not reset this high-temperature trip above the manufactur-
er’s specifications without prior consultation with the equipment 
manufacturer. 
42.7  Variable Molecular Weight
My client had installed a reciprocating compressor to supply feed gas 
to a hydrogen production facility. The design gas composition was:
• 50 percent methane
• 50 percent ethane
• Molecular weight = 24

	
R e c i p r o c a t i n g  C o m p r e s s o r s 	
563
However, after placing the purchase order for the new compres-
sor, the design basis was changed. The new design gas composition 
was:
• 82 percent hydrogen
• 10 percent methane
• 8 percent ethane
• Molecular weight = 6
My client asked me if they should cancel the order for the new 
machine and specify a revised compressor. I advised them to forget 
about the difference between the two cases. It would not make much 
difference to a reciprocating compressor.
In both cases, the volume of gas (or number of moles) compressed 
would be about the same. I calculated that due to a larger compress-
ibility factor, the hydrogen-rich gas case would reduce the number of 
moles of gas compressed by about 2 percent, compared to the first 
methane-ethane mixture case.
Further, I calculated that due to a greater ratio of the specific heats:
Cp/Cv = K
the hydrogen-rich gas case would increase compression work per 
mole of gas by about 5 percent, compared to the methane-ethane mix-
ture case. As the motor driver was oversized by 30 percent, the extra 
compression work was of little significance.
Based on my evaluation, the new reciprocating compressor was pur-
chased as originally specified for the 24 molecular weight gas case. When 
the machine was put in service, with its design 50 percent methane- 
50 percent ethane gas feed, it handled its design rate of 400,000 SCF/hr 
(standard cubic feet per hour). However, the preferred hydrogen plant 
feed was the gas with 82 percent hydrogen (i.e., the 6 molecular weight 
gas). When the operators switched to the hydrogen-rich gas, the flow 
indication of feed gas to the hydrogen plant dropped to 200,000 SCF/hr.
The operators at the hydrogen plant immediately radioed the 
outside operator at the new feed gas reciprocating compressor that 
they were losing their feed gas flow. Quickly, the outside operator 
swung back to the 24 molecular weight gas stream, and flow was 
restored to 400,000 SCF/hr.
42.7.1  Effect of Gas Density on Flow Indication
Please do not think I’m making this story up. It’s true. The location 
was the Coastal Refinery in Aruba. The engineer assigned to this proj-
ect spent $85,000 for 16 new compressor valves for the reciprocating 
compressor. These valves had a somewhat smaller valve plate lift to 
accommodate the lower molecular gas. Of course, this sort of minor 
fine-tuning made no noticeable difference. Switching from 24 to  

	
564	
C h a p t e r  F o r t y - T w o
6 molecular weight gas still caused the indicated flow to the hydro-
gen plant to drop by half.
The process manager convened a meeting to discuss this disaster. 
Inevitably, I was blamed for the poor efficiency of the compressor 
when handling the hydrogen-rich gas. In my defense, I presented the 
following calculation for gas flow measured by an orifice plate:
	
1.	 Flow is proportional to the square root of the pressure drop 
through the orifice plate.
	
2.	 Pressure drop through an orifice plate is proportional to gas 
density. That is, if the gas density doubles, so will the observed 
pressure drop.
	
3.	 Gas density is proportional to the molecular weight. If the 
molecular weight increases from 6 to 24, the density of the 
gas will increase by a factor of four.
	
4.	 Therefore, gas flow measured by an orifice plate is propor-
tional to the square root of the molecular weight of the gas 
flowing through the orifice plate.
I then explained to the plant manager that the flow of gas through 
the orifice plate flowmeter had always been constant. The smaller 
indicated flow of hydrogen-rich gas was not real. My client had for-
gotten to adjust the flowmeter for the lighter gas composition.
Remember, the compressor and the associated instrumentation 
had originally been specified for the heavier 50 percent methane- 
50 percent ethane mixture. When the correct meter factor for the 
lighter 82 percent hydrogen gas was used, the indicated flow corre-
sponded to the design 400,000 SCF/hr.
This story relates the performance of a reciprocating compressor 
to a variable gas composition. The effects are very small. However, 
had a fixed-speed centrifugal compressor been used in a service with 
such a large variation in gas molecular weight, the story would not 
have had a favorable outcome.

CHAPTER 43
Compressor 
Efficiency
Effect on Driver Load
L
et’s assume that we are driving a centrifugal compressor with 
a constant-speed electric motor. We are compressing natural 
gas, coming right off a thousand wellheads, in Laredo, Texas. 
This is not a good idea. There is entrained brine (salty water) in the 
gas. The brine will dry out inside the compressor case, due to the heat 
of compression. The resulting salts will deposit on and inside the 
wheels or stages of the compressor’s rotor. 
The compressor efficiency will be adversely affected. As a 
consequence:
• The flow of gas compressed will be reduced.
• The discharge temperature of the compressor will increase.
• The amp load on the electric motor driver will go down.
Why, though, does it take less work to drive the compressor 
when its rotor wheels are encrusted with salt? It is true that it takes 
somewhat more work to compress a mole of gas with a fouled rotor. 
But the fouled rotor also compresses a lot fewer moles of gas. There-
fore, the net effect of rotor fouling is a reduced workload for the 
motor driver.
Let’s now assume that I am driving the same compressor 
with a gas-fired turbine. The fuel-gas regulator to the turbine is 
100 percent open. The turbine is spinning at 10,000 rpm. As the 
compressor’s rotor fouls with salt, what happens to the speed of 
the turbine?
Answer—it runs faster! It is easier to spin the compressor rotor 
when its efficiency is impaired. The salt-encrusted wheels do not bite 
as hard into the gas as would clean wheels. The amount of gas moved 
is reduced, even though the rotor is spinning faster.

43.1  Jet Engine
A gas- or diesel-fired turbine driver is essentially the same as a jet engine. 
The burning gas spins a turbine. The turbine spins two compressors:
• The natural-gas compressor we have been discussing.
• An air compressor. The discharge pressure from this air com-
pressor might be 80 to 90 psig. The compressed air is used as 
the combustion air supply to combust the turbine’s fuel. The 
majority of the horsepower output from the turbine (perhaps 
60 percent) is used to drive this combustion air compressor.
The horsepower output from a gas turbine is seldom limited by the 
position of the fuel-gas regulator, as I just described in the previous 
example. The limit is usually the exhaust temperature of the combus-
tion or flue gases. The turbine’s blades have a metallurgical tempera-
ture limit of 1100 to 1200°F (as designated by the manufacturer). The 
temperature of the exhaust combustion gases correlates with the tem-
perature of the turbine blades.
Now, let us again assume that our natural-gas compressor rotor 
begins to foul with salt, drilling mud, and/or a paraffin wax, pro-
duced with the gas. Here is what will happen:
	
1.	 The flow of compressed natural gas will decrease.
	
2.	 The turbine and the compressor will both spin faster.
	
3.	 The combustion air flow from the front-end air compressor 
will increase.
	
4.	 The air-to-fuel ratio in the turbine’s combustion chamber will 
increase.
	
5.	 The exhaust combustion flue-gas temperature will drop as 
the air-to-fuel ratio rises.
	
6.	 The fuel-gas regulator can now be opened, because we are no 
longer constrained by the exhaust-gas temperature.
	
7.	 The extra fuel gas, plus the extra combustion air, increases the 
horsepower output from the turbine.
Strange to say, but we could move almost as much natural gas with a 
dirty compressor rotor as we could with a clean compressor rotor. Of 
course, the amount of fuel we needed to run the turbine increased substan-
tially as the rotor salted up. But our fuel in Laredo was self-produced, and 
therefore more or less free natural gas, so we did not care.
43.2  Controlling Vibration and Temperature Rise
43.2.1  Vibration
But we learned to care. You see, rotor fouling is a double-edged 
sword. It cuts two ways. One aspect of rotor fouling is loss of adiabatic 

	
C o m p r e s s o r  E f f i c i e n c y 	
567
compressor efficiency, which wastes work and reduces flow. The 
other edge of the sword is vibration.
Eventually, the fouling deposits on the rotor will become so thick 
that they start to break off, especially if you shut the compressor 
down for a few hours for minor repairs to the lube-oil system. When 
the compressor is put back on line, bits and pieces of grayish salt 
break off and unbalance the rotor. At 8000 rpm, the high-vibration 
trip cuts off the fuel to the gas turbine, and the machine is taken off 
line for repair.
The compressor is disassembled. I get the opportunity to accom-
pany the rotor to Dallas, in the back of a van that needed a new sus-
pension. Once there, I watched the manufacturer’s machinist crew 
clean and rebalance the wheels. I noticed that the salt deposits were 
thickest on the middle wheel. The last wheel was only slightly 
encrusted while the first wheel was clean, except for some waxy 
grease.
Why this sort of salt distribution? I reasoned that the entrained 
brine did not dry out until it reached the middle wheel. But by the 
time it reached the last wheel, all the salt deposits that were going to 
accumulate in the compressor had done so.
This gave me an idea. Suppose we injected a liquid spray into the 
front end of the compressor (we eventually used a heavy aromatic 
naphtha obtained from a local refinery). This could prevent the 
deposits from sticking to the spinning wheels. We tried it, and it 
worked. Rotor fouling and the consequent vibrations and loss of 
capacity became far less frequent.
This reminds me of something. Dear reader, you cannot learn 
anything from our book. You cannot learn about process equipment 
by reading about it. You have to ride in the back of the van.
43.2.2  Temperature Rise
In general, an inefficient compressor will have a high discharge tem-
perature. As compressor efficiency declines, less of the driver’s work 
will go into compression, and more of the driver’s work will be 
degraded into heat.
On the other hand, a high compressor discharge temperature 
may be due to a larger compression ratio. The compression ratio is 
the discharge pressure P2 divided by the suction pressure P1. Both P1 
and P2 are expressed in psia (not in psig).
I have put these ideas together in a single equation:

43.3  Relative Efficiency
You cannot use the information presented in this text to design 
compressors. You cannot use the information presented in this 
book to calculate actual compressor efficiency. Those are complex 
subjects.
But we are not concerned with establishing the actual compressor 
efficiency. What we wish to know are the answers to the following 
sorts of questions:
• What is my compressor efficiency today compared to its 
efficiency last month or right after the unit turnaround last 
year?
• What is my compressor efficiency today compared to its 
design efficiency?
• What is the efficiency of cylinder A compared to cylinder B 
on my reciprocating compressor?
• Which is more efficient—my beat-up, old centrifugal compres-
sor, or my brand-new reciprocating compressor? Both machines 
are working in parallel, but which has a better adiabatic com-
pression efficiency?
We can answer these questions using Eq. (43.1), which defines 
relative efficiency. The calculated numerical value of relative efficiency 
means nothing! The equation may be used only to compare two sets 
of operating data. The equation is not even thermodynamically cor-
rect. But it is sufficiently correct, provided the services represented by 
the two sets of data are reasonably similar and the compression ratios 
are within 10 to 20 percent of each other.
43.3.1  Axial Air Compressor Example
An axial air compressor is like a simple, but better, version of a cen-
trifugal compressor. Instead of wheels and stators, it has rotating 
blades and fixed vanes. In a modern, large jet engine, the combustion 
air is supplied by an axial air compressor. The machine shown in 
Fig. 43.1 is supplying air to a fluid catalytic cracker unit catalyst 
regenerator in southern Louisiana. The operating parameters shown 
on the sketch itself were taken when the compressor was thought to 
be in an abnormally fouled condition. We are going to compare the 
relative adiabatic compression efficiency for three conditions:
• Fouled
• Normal
• Design

To do this, we will use the relative-efficiency equation, Eq. (35.1):
• Fouled condition: (Data shown on sketch)

From these relative-efficiency values, we can draw the following con-
clusions:

ing at only 82.5 percent of its “normal condition” efficiency. This 
means that the fouling problem is really rather severe.
• The adiabatic compression efficiency of the air compressor, 
running in its normal condition, is only 79.4 percent of its

design condition. The manufacturer’s design adiabatic com-
pression efficiency is quoted as 81 percent. Therefore, the “nor-
mal condition” adiabatic compression efficiency is approximately
81% × 79.4% = 64.3%
Not too good! A detergent solution was injected into the air intake 
of the axial compressor, and the adiabatic compression efficiency 
recovered to about 80 percent.
I like to calculate the relative compression efficiency because I do 
not have to know the flow of process gas. I do not have to know the 
driver horsepower output, the steam to the turbine, the fuel gas to the 
gas turbine, or the speed of the compressor. I do not have to know Z 
(the gas compressibility factor) or K (the ratio of the specific heats). 
The things I do have to know—the suction and discharge temperature 
and pressure—I can check with my own hands and my own tools.
43.3.2  Parallel Compressors
Let us assume that a reciprocating compressor has two cylinders 
working in parallel. Each cylinder has both a crank-end section 
and a head-end suction, where gas is compressed. In effect, we have 
four small compressors working in parallel. The inlet and outlet 
pressures, and hence the compression ratio, for each of these four 
minicompressors are the same. The relative efficiency for each mini-
compressor is then

You can measure these temperatures with an infrared, noncontact 
temperature gun. True, this only tells us pipe external temperatures, but 
as long as we are consistent, use of such skin temperatures is acceptable.
Using this easy technique, we can guide the maintenance effort as 
to which reciprocating compressor valves must be overhauled and 
which valves are working correctly.
Caution: If the inlet side temperature for any cylinder end is hotter 
than the main gas inlet header pipe, then there is zero gas flow 
through this cylinder end. The adiabatic and relative compression 
efficiencies are also zero.
43.4  Relative Work: External Pressure Losses
Liz and I had a project to expand the wet-gas compressor capacity of 
a centrifugal machine in Pasadena, Texas. We ran a pressure survey 
on the compressor system, as summarized in Fig. 43.2.
Our client had been monitoring the inlet pressure to the compres-
sor at the P1 pressure point. But we found that the actual compressor 
inlet pressure was 2 psi lower, due to the in-line basket filter.

This filter had apparently never been cleaned. Our client then asked 
us to calculate the percent of the motor amps being wasted across the 
partially plugged basket filter.

About 10 percent more moles or volume of gas could be handled, 
with approximately the same amperage load, on the electric motor 
driver. A nice example of the Second Law of Thermodynamics in 
action.
If you want to be lazy and use Eq. (43.1) and ignore the fractional 
exponent, the work wasted would have been 11.3 percent. That is, 
you could just take the ratio of 19 psia divided by 17 psia. Liz calls 
this “Norming a problem.” Meaning it’s a quick, approximate, and 
lazy way of getting to the answer.

CHAPTER 44
Safety Concerns
Relief Valves, 
Corrosion, and Safety Trips
Y
our process unit likely contains a wide variety of safety features 
and equipment. These safety features fall under the following 
three categories: 
• Relief valves
• Corrosion monitoring
• Alarms and trips
It is certainly my experience that the most common and catastrophic 
accidents in process units are related to corrosion-type failures. I cannot 
bring to mind any process vessels that were definitely overpressured 
and failed because a relief valve did not open.
Relief valves were invented to prevent steam boilers from blowing 
up as a result of excessive steam drum pressure. This was a distress-
ingly common occurrence in the nineteenth century. The relief valve is 
also called a safety (or “pop”) valve. When the pressure in a vessel 
exceeds a preset amount, the relief valve is supposed to pop or spring 
open. Gas will then be vented from the vessel until the pressure in the 
vessel drops by 10 to 20 psi below its relief-valve-set pressure. We usu-
ally operate pressure vessels at 25 psig or 10 percent below the relief-
valve setting.
The relief-valve-set, or pop, pressure is adjusted in a machine 
shop. A large threaded nut on top of the relief valve is used to make this 
adjustment. Air pressure is applied to the valve, and the technician 
adjusts this nut until the relief valve opens at the proper pressure.
The pressure at which relief valves are set to open is the vessel 
design pressure. The vessel design pressure (maximum allowable 
working pressure, MAWP) is stamped on the manufacturer’s name-
plate. It is illegal to set the relief valve at a higher pressure. The vessel is 
probably hydrostatically tested at a pressure 50 percent greater than its 
573

	
574	
C h a p t e r  F o r t y - F o u r
design pressure. This test pressure also is listed on the nameplate. You 
cannot use the test pressure as a guide to set the relief valves.
Sometimes vessels are rerated. Often, we can increase the design 
pressure of a vessel by taking credit for an excessive corrosion allow-
ance, which is an extra thickness of metal added to the vessel wall. 
Designers do not include this extra thickness in their pressure-rating 
calculations. However, if experience teaches that there is little corrosion, 
then the vessel may be rerated and receive a new pressure-rating 
stamp. There are rigorous, formal, legal procedures to follow in 
rerating a vessel.
On the other hand, vessels must often be derated for age and 
excessive corrosion. Either way, the relief valve needs to be reset. 
There is only one way to know the actual relief-valve setting, and that 
is to climb up to the relief valve and read the tag that was fixed to the 
valve at the time of its last setting.
I used to reset relief valves on small pressure vessels in the natural-
gas fields in southern Texas. After adjusting the nut on the valve with 
a wrench, I would raise the vessel pressure to check whether the valve 
would relieve at the proper pressure. If not, I would continue to adjust 
the nut and, by trial and error, find the proper relief-valve setting. This 
is not a particularly practical method to adjust relief valves on stream 
on a process unit. It is also illegal to do so.
Many relief valves pop open above or below their set point. Such 
valves have to be removed from the vessel and reset in a machine shop. 
Often, there are isolating block valves, located beneath the relief valve, 
that permit the relief valve to be pulled while the vessel is still in ser-
vice. These block valves are perfectly legal, provided they are chain-
locked open. It is unlawful to have an isolating valve below a relief valve 
that is not chain-locked open or sealed open in some positive manner.
44.1  Relief-Valve Plugging
Often, relief valves do not open because their piping connection to 
the vessel is plugged with corrosion products, salts, or coke. Even if 
this connection is only partially plugged, the effective capacity of the 
relief valve is greatly diminished.
A rupture disk is a thin sheet of metal installed below the valve, 
intended to protect the relief valve from plugging. The rupture disk rup-
tures at the relief-valve-set pressure. A better approach to retard this 
plugging problem is to maintain a steam purge, or inert-gas bleed, below 
the relief valve to prevent the accumulation of solids below the valve.
Often, relief valves fail to close once they have popped open. I 
hate this! I hate the tension. Will it or won’t it reseat by itself? Or will 
some operator have to climb up the 180-ft crude distillation column 
and hammer on the side of the relief valve until it reseats? Especially 
if the relief valve is venting to the atmosphere rather than the flare, 
this can be a nasty and dangerous job.

	
S a f e t y  C o n c e r n s 	
575
Furnace tubes, process piping, and heat exchangers may also have 
to be protected by relief valves. Incidentally, the small 1-inch relief 
valves you see on many tank field loading lines and on heat exchangers 
are not process relief valves. They are there for thermal-expansion pro-
tection only. This means that if you block in a liquid-filled exchanger 
and the liquid is heated, the liquid must expand or the exchanger will 
fail. That is what the thermal relief valve is there to prevent.
Typically, heat exchangers, piping, and furnace tubes have a cer-
tain flange rating. For example, 150-psi flanges have a pressure rating 
of about 220 psig, and not 150 psig. A 300-psi flange has a rating of 
roughly 430 psig. If the upstream process pump has a shut-in or 
dead-head pressure exceeding this flange rating, then a downstream 
protective relief valve is required.
44.2  Relieving to Atmosphere
In 2004, at the B.P. Refinery in Texas City, 15 contract workers were 
killed and 170 seriously burned. The relief valve opened on the top of 
a naphtha splitter. The relief valve did not vent to the flare, but to a 
blowdown stack. The blowdown stack was open to the atmosphere 
and drained to a sewer. This drain had a loop seal to prevent vapors 
from blowing into the sewer.
The operators were starting the tower:
	
1.	 The tower was on total reflux.
	
2.	 The bottom level control valve was closed in the field.
 
3. The bottom flowmeter was off-zero, and showed a substan-
tial flow.
	
4.	 The bottom liquid level indicator on the panel indicated a less 
than full level, even when the bottoms level was above the 
top level tap.
The operators, being unaware of the last three facts, filled the tower 
almost to the top with naphtha and increased heat flow to the tower. The 
relief valve, set for 50 psig, opened as the liquid in the tower swelled up 
due to the extra heat. The boiling naphtha partially flashed as it flowed 
from 50 psig in the tower to zero psig in the blowdown stack.
As the boiling naphtha flowed through the loop seal of the blow-
down stack drain, the loop seal became vapor locked. Or perhaps the 
volume of boiling naphtha exceeded the drain’s capacity. Regardless, 
the naphtha backed up in the blowdown stack to the inlet nozzle. The 
evolved vapors blew the liquid out of the top of the stack. The naphtha 
ignited in the midst of the contractor trailer park built around the blow-
down stack. Two additional points are relevant:
• In the 1970s I assisted, in a minor capacity, Gary Elmer in the 
design of this tower. At that time, the refinery was an Amoco 

	
576	
C h a p t e r  F o r t y - F o u r
Oil plant, and Gary and I worked in the Chicago Engineering 
Design Division. As process design engineers, we did not 
worry about relief valve vents.
• In 1974, I was promoted to the position of operating supervisor 
at the Amoco Refinery in Texas City. I had four tall distillation 
towers on my alkylation unit. The towers had relief valves at 
the top of the tower. These relief valves vented to the atmo-
sphere. Over-pressuring was common and I saw the white 
plume blowing from the valves on many occasions. Never 
did I stop and think, “What will happen if a relief valve opens 
when a tower is in fully developed flood?”
Now I and everyone else in Texas City knows what happens. 
How about your unit? Do you have relief valves on vessels in hydro-
carbon service that open to the atmosphere? What would happen on 
your unit if the safety relief valve opened when the vessel is full of 
liquid?
I have asked this question at many plants in the past years. The 
majority still have safety reliefs venting to the atmosphere even 
though everyone in the United States refinery industry knows what 
happened in Texas City in 2004. To summarize, when considering the 
safe operation of relief valve systems, the following assumptions 
should be made:
• The valve will open some day.
• When the valve opens, the process vessel will be full of liquid.
• The liquid will be at its boiling point at the pressure at which 
the relief valve opens.
• There will be a source of ignition present downstream of the 
relief valve. 
As you evaluate the above criteria, recall that there were scores of 
towers in Texas City operating for many decades. These towers relieved 
to the atmosphere (some of which I designed), and nothing ever hap-
pened. Nothing ever happened until that terrible incident in 2004.
44.3  Corrosion Monitoring
On older process units, you may still encounter piping with sentry 
holes. Let’s say I have a 0.5-inch thick pipe. The corrosion allowance 
for the pipe is 0.25 inch. A number of small holes are drilled into the 
pipe to a depth of 0.25 inch. When we start leaking at these small 
holes, this means that the pipe has corroded to its discard thickness in 
the area of the sentry hole. Incidentally, you can stop the resulting 
leak, at least in carbon steel water lines, with a brass wood screw and 
a screwdriver. I have also done this on hydrocarbon lines under an 
80-psig pressure, but perhaps that was not too smart.

	
S a f e t y  C o n c e r n s 	
577
A more modern method to check for loss of thickness in process 
piping is by ultrasonic testing (UT) or Sonaray. These are portable 
instruments used to check pipe thickness on-stream. Do not forget, 
though, that the thin elbow, the one that is sure to fail, is always out 
of reach unless a ladder can be found. And the inspector cannot find 
the ladder. The outside radius of elbows are typically the thinnest 
portions of a piping run. I became the world’s leading expert on not 
finding ladders and not UT-checking thin elbows at the Amoco Oil 
Refinery in Texas City in 1976—just prior to the alkylation unit explo-
sion. The explosion that wrecked half of the refinery.
44.3.1  Corrosion Coupons
I always like corrosion coupons. They are a tangible piece of hard-
ware that you can hold in your hand. A corrosion coupon is just a 
piece of metal, perhaps 0.25 inch thick, 3 inch long, and 0.5 inch 
wide, that is inserted into the flowing process stream through a 
packing gland in a valve. It can be easily pulled for inspection 
every week or every month. The corrosion engineer weighs the 
coupon for metal loss and inspects it for pitting and other forms of 
corrosive attack. Often, a number of corrosion coupons of various 
metallurgy are used. The corrosion engineer then calculates, on 
the basis of the metal lost from the coupon in one month, the mils 
per year corrosion rate.
For example, a steel pipe is 0.5 inch thick, or 250 mils. Its discard 
thickness is 0.125 inch thick, or 125 mils. If the corrosion rate is meas-
ured at 25 mils per year, then the expected life of the pipe is five years. 
Corrosion rates in excess of 10 mils per year are normally considered 
excessive and unacceptable, at least in petroleum refineries.
44.3.2  Corrosion Probes
This is an electronic method used to measure corrosion rate in mils 
per year. The corrosion probe can be inserted through a packing 
gland. It is read periodically with a portable instrument that meas-
ures the change in electrical conductivity of the probe. It is simple, 
but perhaps a little less reliable than the coupon.
There is another sort of probe that measures ionic hydrogen pen-
etration into and through steel walls. Such hydrogen activity is a prod-
uct of corrosion and/or high hydrogen partial pressures in a vessel. 
This sort of hydrogen activity promotes hydrogen blistering and 
stress corrosion cracking of vessel walls. A sketch of a hydrogen 
probe is shown in Fig. 44.1. It consists simply of a small chamber 
welded onto the exterior of a vessel. A pressure gauge is connected to 
this chamber.
The hydrogen ions (or protons) dissolve and pass through the iron 
lattice structure of the vessel wall. When some of them emerge at the 
outside of the vessel wall, they are trapped inside the hydrogen probe 
chamber. There, the ionic hydrogen is converted into molecular hydrogen. 

	
578	
C h a p t e r  F o r t y - F o u r
The rate of pressure increase inside the chamber is a direct measure of 
the amount of ionic hydrogen infiltration through the lattice structure 
of the steel wall of the process vessel.
Often massive corrosion failures occur suddenly, without the 
warning of any small leaks. Lines part at welds, vessels burst apart as 
a result of hydrogen-assisted stress corrosion cracking, and thin 
elbows peel back like the top of a soup can. Process plants are danger-
ous places, mainly because of corrosion; hence the importance of 
monitoring corrosion. It is the responsibility of the unit chemical or 
process engineers to monitor corrosion on their units.
44.4  Alarms and Trips
44.4.1  Safety Trips
One of the most common safety trips is the automatic fuel-gas shutoff. 
We have this at home on our furnaces. We ignite the pilot light manu-
ally. The pilot light heats a thermocouple. The milliamp output from 
this thermocouple opens the fuel-gas valve to the main burner. The 
gas in the main burner is ignited from the pilot-light flame. Should the 
H2

Ions

S a f e t y  C o n c e r n s 	
579
heat from the pilot light diminish below a certain point, the fuel gas to 
the main burner, as well as to the pilot light, will be shut off.
A less common type of fuel-gas trip to a heater is a low-pressure 
trip. A pressure transducer generates a milliamp output from a boiler 
feedwater pump. Should this milliamp output fall below a certain 
level, the instrument air signal to the fuel-gas regulator actuator will 
be shut off. These fuel-gas valves are air-to-open, meaning that loss of 
instrument air flow causes the valve to close.
Some fired heaters, especially boilers, have a device called a “pur-
ple peeper,” which is simply an optical device that looks at a flame. If it 
does not detect light with a wavelength in the high-frequency (i.e., 
purple) end of the optical scale, it interprets this as a flame-out. The 
fuel-gas regulator is automatically shut.
High process heater outlet temperatures are another trip point for 
many heaters. These sorts of trips are subject to a rather deadly mal-
function. If the process flow is totally lost, the heater tubes may 
become extraordinarily hot. But the high-temperature trip may be 
located too far from the heater outlet to be affected by the high tem-
perature in the heater. This particular malfunction occurred in a 
southern Louisiana refinery, and indirectly led to the deaths of a score 
of workers. This is why we have P&ID (piping and instrumentation 
diagram) reviews when our unit is being designed. Fuel to a boiler 
may also be shut down by a low water level in the boiler’s steam 
drum. The low-level trip is simply a float chamber. If the float drops to 
the bottom of the chamber, it flips a mercuroid switch, which shuts off 
the fuel-gas supply to the boiler. These mercuroid switches look quite 
similar to the thermostat switch we have inside our house, which 
switches the air conditioner on or off. Note that these level trip float 
chambers, even though they are quite short, still require two level taps 
on the vessel.
Some heaters also have a low fuel-gas pressure trip on the fuel 
gas itself. The idea here is that if fuel-gas flow is lost, we do not want 
it to surge back into the heater too quickly if the fuel-gas pressure is 
suddenly restored.
44.4.2  Compressor Trips
Our home circuit breakers, or fuses, are, of course, trips to prevent 
overheating electric circuits or electric motors. The only difference 
is that at work our electric circuit breakers have a built-in time delay. 
This is needed to allow the motor driver to overcome the starting 
torque inherent in most large pieces of rotating process equipment.
Also, the motor trips are activated, not by excessive motor tem-
peratures, but by an excessive measured amp load to the motor. This 
is called the FLA (full limit amp load) point. The FLA point may be 
increased by perhaps 10%, but this will reduce the motor’s opera-
tional life. Our motor trips at home are activated not by the measured 
amp load, but by excessive motor temperatures.

	
580	
C h a p t e r  F o r t y - F o u r
Compressors also have vibration trips. These trips measure the 
amplitude of the vibrations—which, if they become excessive, will 
shut off the fuel, steam, or electricity to the compressor’s driver.
Turbines, both gas and steam, also have overspeed trips. These 
consist of a little flywheel constructed from three balls. The little balls 
are spread apart by centrifugal force. The greater the rpm, the greater 
the centrifugal force. If the balls spread apart too far, they activate the 
trip. We have James Watt to thank for this neat innovation, still used 
in its original form.
Most large compressors also have a low-lube-oil-pressure trip. 
This again would shut off the fuel or steam to a turbine if the lube-oil 
pressure gets too low. It is interesting to note that the low-lube-oil 
pressure that activates the trip is not the lube-oil pressure to the bear-
ing that would be damaged because of a lack of lube-oil flow. Rather, it 
is the low-lube-oil pressure to the trip switch itself that directly shuts 
down the turbine or motor. Thus, with a low-lube-oil pressure, one can 
trip off a compressor without actually losing lubrication flow to the bear-
ings at all.
Compressors are also served by high-liquid-level trips in their 
upstream knockout drums. These high-liquid-level trips work in the 
same way as the low-level boiler trips discussed above, except that 
the mercuroid switch is activated by a rising, rather than a falling, 
liquid level so as to protect the compressor from a slug of liquid.
A final word about trips. Any trip that is not tested on some rou-
tine basis can never work in an emergency. I will guarantee you that 
when the coupling shears on that steam turbine driving that 4000-bhp 
compressor, the overspeed trip that should shut off the steam flow to 
the turbine will not in fact trip if you have not tested that same trip 
recently. I promise you that the trip valve mechanism will be encrusted 
with hardness deposits from the steam. While the trip lever may be 
unlatched, the turbine will continue to spin merrily along, until it 
self-destructs as a result of uncontrolled overspeed. And, ladies and 
gentlemen, you may imagine how I have become so knowledgeable 
about this particular subject.
44.5  Auto-ignition of Hydrocarbons
Heavy hydrocarbons, such as vacuum tower bottom products, tar, 
and pitch, are frequently pumped and stored in tanks above their 
auto-ignition temperatures. The process reason for this is to prevent 
these fluids from “setting up” or solidifying in the pipelines or tanks. 
At ambient temperatures, even in hot climates, these fluids would 
normally be either solid or extremely viscous.
A hydrocarbon above its auto-ignition temperature will sponta-
neously ignite upon exposure to air without any source of ignition. 
This is why there are often fires on pumps that pump heavy hydro-
carbons. If the seal on a pump in such a service begins to leak, the 

	
S a f e t y  C o n c e r n s 	
581
heavy material then leaks out and spontaneously catches fire. Be 
careful when taking pressure surveys or sampling from these hot, 
heavy hydrocarbon lines to avoid spillage. The risk of auto-ignition 
increases for fluids above their auto-ignition temperature as the sur-
face area of spillage increases. As the surface area increases, the 
surface area of the hot, heavy hydrocarbon exposed to the oxygen 
in the surrounding air also increases. Spillage on the ground, leaks 
into insulation material, and spillage onto rags are all increasing 
the risk of auto-ignition by increasing the surface area exposed to 
oxygen.
44.5.1  A Hazardous Piping Configuration
Sections of piping that contain a pair of alternate 90-degree elbows or 
alternate right-angled bends are hazardous. These should be avoided 
when designing pipe work because:
• When fluid flows through such pipe work, it changes momen-
tum at the opposing angles of the turns that the pipe work 
requires it to make. These changes in momentum act upon 
the pipe work configuration to make it rotate or spin, just like 
a two-sailed windmill where the right-angled ends are the 
“sails,” or just like one of those fireworks that come as a pair 
of identical fireworks mounted in opposite directions at either 
end of a piece of wood—we pin the wooden strip to a fence, 
light the pair of fireworks, and watch the assembly spin. Piping 
sections are anchored, but considerable stresses are set up 
within such a system.
• The changes of momentum occurring in the fluid as it flows 
around the bends make the inner wall at the outer edge of the 
elbows particularly susceptible to erosion.
Outages and some serious incidents have occurred as a result of 
the use of this type of piping configuration (see Fig. 44.2).
44.6  Paper Gaskets
I was talking to my friend Dan Rogers at a Texaco refinery. Dan said 
to remind my readers to beware of “paper gaskets.” Gaskets seal the 
ends of flanges used to assemble piping spool pieces. High-temperature 
and high-pressure gaskets are made of metal. In the past few years, 
the use of so-called “paper gaskets” has become common. Theoreti-
cally, these gaskets have a temperature rating of 500°F. In practice, 
they should only be used for:
• Blinding equipment during a unit turnaround when the 
blind flange will not be exposed to much more than ambient 
temperatures

	
582	
C h a p t e r  F o r t y - F o u r
• Cooling water, plant air, firewater, low-pressure steam
• Services below 250°F or where a leak will be an inconven-
ience and not a safety issue
These paper gaskets will look pale green-blue when viewed edge-
on between the flanges. Dan says that their use has caused several 
fires at his plant for services below their rated 500°F temperature limit.
44.7  Calculating Heats of Reaction
My client had burned a hole in a hydrotreating reactor at the Coastal 
Refinery in Aruba. The reactor was not in service, it was on standby 
with once-through hydrogen flowing through the reactor. The hydro-
gen was coming from a hydrogen production plant, which was in a 
start-up mode of operation. The failure in the side of the reactor 
looked like someone had burned a hole through the 4-inch steel wall 
from inside the vessel. This was consistent with plant data that indi-
cated reactor temperature had exceeded 1800°F.
The failure was due to combustion of oxygen plus hydrocarbons. 
The combustion reaction involved was:
 
CO + 3H2 = CH4 + H2O

This is a methanation reaction. The hydrogen reacts with the car-
bon monoxide to produce water, methane, and heat. My job was to 
calculate how hot the reactor could get with 4 percent carbon monox-
ide in the hydrogen supply gas. To do this I looked up in Perry’s 
Chemical Engineering Handbook, McGraw-Hill 5th ed., 1973, the heats 
of formation of:
• CO  = 24.21 kcal per gram-mole
•	 H2 	 = 0 (as are all elements)
• CH4 	= 17.88 kcal per gram-mole
•	 H2O 	= 15.80 kcal per gram-mole
Adding up the heats of formation on both sides of Eq. (44.1) and 
taking their difference gives a total heat of reaction of 49.2 kcal (49,200 
calories). This would be the heat of reaction if there were 25 percent 
CO and 75 percent H2 in the feed gas. However, the feed gas contained 
4 percent CO, not 25 percent CO. Therefore, the heat of reaction was:
•	 (4 percent divided by 25 percent) × 49,200 = 7900 calories
The 96 percent hydrogen and 4 percent CO in the feed gas would 
be converted to:
•	 92 mole percent hydrogen
•	 0 carbon monoxide
•	 4 mole percent methane
•	 4 mole percent water
The combined specific heat of this mixture is:
•	 7.0 calories per mole per 1°C
Dividing the heat of reaction (7900 calories) by the specific heat of 
the products of reaction (7.0 calories per mole per 1°C) results in a 
temperature rise of 1130°C or 2040°F.
This calculation shows how 100°F hydrogen flowing to the reac-
tor could have reacted, when exposed to a catalyst bed, to produce 
temperatures of 2000°F.
44.8  Hot Water Explodes Out of Manway
I just put down the phone. Two pipe fitters were burned opening the 
demineralizer drum shown in Fig. 44.3. My client wanted to under-
stand what happened. It’s a common incident.
The water-filled drum had been depressured by venting to the 
atmosphere. The drum had been drained to a level just below the man-
way. The manway was carefully and slowly unbolted and removed. 

	
584	
C h a p t e r  F o r t y - F o u r
Nothing happened for a few minutes. Suddenly the hot water boiled 
out of the open manway.
This happens because the drum is not at a uniform temperature. 
The water in the drum is at its bubble point or saturated liquid tem-
perature throughout the drum. But because the water in the lower 
portion of the drum is at a higher pressure due to the static head of 
water, its saturation temperature is also higher than the water at the 
top of the drum. Also, the cooler water at the top of the drum is a little 
denser than the hotter water at the bottom.
If something happens to disturb this delicate balance, the hot 
water at the bottom will move toward the top. As the hotter water 
moves up, it loses a bit of head pressure and starts to vaporize. The 
bubbles of steam stir up the vessel’s contents and accelerate boiling 
and steam evolution. The sudden generation of steam pushes the hot 
water out the open manway.
Honestly, this explanation is my best guess. But what I’m not 
guessing at is that this incident is not unusual. It’s safer to drain satu-
rated water levels well below manways before they are opened.  
I have accidentally drained 180°F heavy naphtha on my gloved hand 
without injury. A similar careless incident with 180°F water resulted 
in a trip to the Texas City infirmary. Excluding fire, hot water is more 
hazardous to personnel than hydrocarbon liquids of the same tem-
perature. Treat hot water with care and respect.

CHAPTER 45
Relief Valve System 
Design
T
he function of a relief valve is to protect a vessel, piping system, 
or heat exchanger from exceeding its maximum allowable 
working pressure (MAWP). The MAWP is shown on the code 
stamp (a metal plate) attached to each process vessel, and by design 
is determined by the size of the impeller on the pump upstream of the 
vessel (see Sec. 34.4.1 in Chap. 34). Normally, the relief valve is set to 
open at this MAWP pressure. The relief valve setting is adjustable 
and is done by a machinist at a shop pressure-testing facility. 
Once a relief valve is forced open by exceeding its set pressure, 
fluid flows out into the relief valve header piping. In most plants, 
there is a piping system that collects the effluents from various relief 
valves. This collection system, in turn, vents to the plant flare system.
Only too often, the relief valve, after opening due to excessive 
pressure, does not close properly when the pressure in the vessel 
drops below its MAWP. We say that the relief valve has “not reseated.” 
Typically, I will bang violently on the valve to encourage it to reseat. 
Often, it will continue to leak anyway and then a complete unit shut-
down may result, so as to repair the faulty relief valve.
As a process design engineer, I do not size relief valves. This is 
easily done by a computer program based on the vessel size, fluid 
properties, and maximum operating pressures. The location of the 
relief valve is a matter, however, that requires careful engineering 
judgment. I will illustrate the problem by several examples drawn 
from my own refinery experience.
45.1  Coke Drums
It was standard practice to protect refinery delayed coker, coke drums, 
from overpressure by locating a relief valve on the overhead vapor 
line. However, the main reason the coke drums would overpressure 
was coke accumulation in the inlet of the vapor line, immediately 
downstream of the coke drum itself and typically just upstream of the 
relief valve. Thus, it was a common occurrence (for example, at the 
585

Suncor Coker at Ft. McMurray and the Citgo Coker in Lake Charles) 
for the coke drums to overpressure without the relief valves opening. 
In one instance, the drum pressure reached over 100 psig, even though 
the relief valve was set at 60 psig.
Now, it is standard practice to site all coke drum relief valves on 
the coke drum itself, and never on the vapor outlet line.
45.2  High-Pressure Fixed-Bed Reactors
Most fixed-bed reactors are designed for downflow. I have in mind a 
typical multibed hydrotreating gas oil reactor or a hydrodesulferizer die-
sel oil reactor. The catalyst bed supports are designed to support the 
weight of the catalyst plus the downward force of the catalyst bed pres-
sure drop.
If the relief valve of a high pressure reactor opens, and the relief 
valve is located on top of the reactor, then the sudden upward surge 
of hydrogen-rich gas will lift up and upset the catalyst bed support 
and the interbed vapor-liquid distributors.
This exact scenario transpired at a 3000-psi white oil hydrotreater 
reactor I had designed for the Amoco Oil Refinery in Whiting, Indiana. 
All seven catalyst beds were destroyed, along with my patented reac-
tor interbed quench distributors. The place to locate the pressure relief 
valves is not at the top, but at the bottom, below the final catalyst bed 
support of the reactor.
45.3  Trayed Towers and Packed Columns
The same logic may apply for tower trays. Of course, such trays are 
designed for vapor upflow, and if a relief valve on the top of the tower 
opens, ordinarily this will not upset the trays. Still, for higher pressure 
towers of larger diameter, sized with larger relief valves, a potential 
problem exists. If opening the pressure relief valve causes the vapor 
flow through the trays to increase by a factor of 3, then this would likely 
damage the tray deck integrity due to the sudden uplift vapor surge.
This logic would also apply to packed towers. However, designing 
for a strong bed limiter (i.e., packing a holddown grid) would largely 
avoid this sort of failure.
I have never seen or heard about tray failure due to a relief valve 
opening. However, in a packed distillation tower, I am aware of at 
least one such incident, also at the Whiting Refinery.
45.4  Liquid-Filled Vessels
Relief valves located on liquid-filled reflux drums can be a major safety 
problem depending on the design and size of the flare knockout (K.O.) 
drum. Some plants have giant flare K.O. drums with large capacity 

	
R e l i e f  Va l v e  S y s t e m  D e s i g n 	
587
automatic pumps. In some plants, the K.O. facility is integral with the 
flare stack itself and the pumps are manually operated.
Overfilling a flare K.O. drum is a serious matter. Liquid hydrocar-
bons may erupt from the flare like a giant flame-thrower. My secre-
tary ran out of the Good Hope Refinery without her shoes when our 
flare stack overflowed. Burning liquid butane erupting from the 
Amoco Oil flare in Whiting, Indiana, was reported as a missile launch 
by a spy satellite.
The ASME Boiler Code may require a liquid-filled vessel to have a 
pressure relief valve if it can be isolated from another vessel that has 
relief valve protection. Then the designer’s obligation is to determine 
if the flare system can handle the volume of liquid depressuring 
through the relief valve on the liquid-filled vessel.
45.5  Sour Water Strippers
45.5.1  Relief Valve Effluent Disposition
In 2006 a terrible fire and explosion killed 15 people and injured 500 
other contractors and employees at the BP Refinery in Texas City. The 
main cause of the disaster was a relief valve on a naphtha splitter that 
vented to the atmosphere via a blowdown stack rather than to the 
flare.
The theory for the location of the relief valve location and disposi-
tion was, I imagine:
	
1.	 Locate the relief valve on the overhead vapor line.
	
2.	 If the relief valve opens, only vapors would be emitted, as only 
vapors are present at the top of the tower.
	
3.	 Hydrocarbon ambient emissions during a plant upset were legal.
I have discussed the entire incident in detail in my book, Trouble-
shooting Process Operations, 4th ed. (PennWell, 2009). The main error 
made in the design was the assumption of only vapor at the top of the 
tower. What was to happen if the tower was completely flooded, in 
this case due to their level instrumentation output?
After the accident, I discussed with BP engineers whether they 
had learned anything from their tragic experience. They responded 
that they no longer connect vessel relief valves in hydrocarbon service 
to an atmospheric vent.
But is this really true? For example, I discussed the design of an 
existing sour water stripper with BP engineers and operators. As this 
was a water stripper, the relief valve had not been connected to the 
flare.
However, in refinery sour water stripper feed tanks, I always find 
a layer of light hydrocarbon floating on the top of the sour water. If 
these lighter hydrocarbons are accidentally charged to the stripper 

	
588	
C h a p t e r  F o r t y - F i v e
(which happens frequently), then the tower will overpressure, and 
the relief valves will open. Thus, reproducing the failure at Texas City.
Also, the emissions of uncombusted hydrogen sulfide vapors 
(H2S) to the atmosphere could also be (although more remotely) a 
potential safety issue. This happened at the Good Hope Refinery 
where I worked in 1981, when reports of noxious odors were reported 
from a local high school. Our plant manager appeared on the television 
news to assure the community that while the H2S odor was bad, it 
was not in the least harmful to the children.
Incidentally, having higher pressure reactors, or other vessels, 
relieving into lower pressure fractionators is not always a good design 
practice. I just put down my phone. I had been talking to the unit engi-
neer at a U.S. midwestern delayed coker. They had overpressured a 
coke drum during water quenching. The relief valve was vented into 
the coker fractionator. This had apparently damaged some of the trays 
in the coker fractionator. A better choice might have been to connect 
the coke drum relief valves to the coker’s blowdown system.
45.6  Protecting Relief Valves from Fouling and Corrosion
There are two methods that I have used to protect process relief 
valves from exposure to corrosive or fouling environments:
• Rupture disks
• Purge steam or gas
Rupture disks are thin sheets of metal that will fail or rupture if 
the relief valve itself opens. The disk acts as a barrier between the 
relief valve and the process fluid. The problem with rupture disks is 
that as an operating manager, I was never sure whether the rupture 
disks were actually intact for any particular relief valve. But what I 
could be sure of, once a relief valve had opened, was that the rupture 
disk protection was gone and could not be restored without shutting 
down and pulling the relief valve.
The use of a vapor purge under the relief valve is a more practical 
approach to protecting relief valves from plugging. However, if a purge 
gas such as nitrogen or natural gas is used, then a non-condensible 
vapor will be introduced into the process stream. Steam is often pre-
ferred for this reason. But then the possibility exists of getting a slug of 
water into the process vessel. The water may then flash, thus causing a 
pressure surge and possible vessel internal damage.
45.7  Dual Relief Valves
One practical method to maintain relief valve operability is to design the 
relief valves for on-stream cleaning and maintenance. As an operating 
manager, this was my preferred design for relief valves subject to fouling.

	
R e l i e f  Va l v e  S y s t e m  D e s i g n 	
589
Of course, an isolation gate valve was required underneath each 
relief valve. This is legal as long as the gate valve is chain-locked 
open. The bigger problem is that if one relief is removed from service 
for maintenance, then the remaining relief valve, or valves, must still 
have full and adequate, capacity. Typically, for larger vessels there 
are three 50 percent capacity relief valves.
45.8  Process Design Responsibility for Relief  
Valve Design
As a process engineer, I consider it my responsibility to specify:
• The location on each process vessel of the required relief 
valves
• Where the relief valve should vent to (atmosphere, blowdown, 
or plant flare)
• Spare relief valve, purge vapor, or rupture disk to maintain 
the relief valve operability in a fouling service
• Range of the fluid pressure characteristics in the vessel being 
protected
Quite often, a higher pressure vessel will vent, not to a flare, but 
to a lower pressure vessel. For example, a high pressure reactor might 
relieve to a low pressure fractionator to recover the liquid portion of 
the relief valve effluent in the larger fractionator. But then the frac-
tionator relief valve must be sized for the vapor venting rate from the 
high-pressure reactor. A complex engineering problem results.
45.9  Relief Valve and Pressure Sensing Connections
Figure 45.1 shows the design of my alkylation unit depropanizer 
relief valve at the Amoco Texas City Refinery in 1975. The tower pres-
sure control was on steam flow to the reboiler.
I had been injecting a corrosion inhibitor into the depropanizer 
with the reflux. The inhibitor was supposed to be soluble in liquid 
propane, but it was not. After several months of using this inhibitor 
chemical, the relief valve nozzle of the top head of the depropanizer 
plugged up. But how did this first come to my attention?
	
1.	 When the relief valve nozzle plugged, the PRC (tower pressure 
control) began to show a lower operating pressure.
	
2.	 The steam flow to the reboiler increased (i.e., heat makes 
pressure).
	
3.	 The PRC setting was at 270 psig. However, my shift foreman, 
Bobby Felts, observed on a local pressure gauge at the tower 
bottom gauge glass, a far greater pressure, of 400 psig.

	
590	
C h a p t e r  F o r t y - F i v e
	
4.	 The PAH (high pressure alarm) shown in Fig. 45.1 did not alarm, 
as it was also connected to the plugged relief valve nozzle.
	
5.	 Finally, the pressure safety relief valve failed to open, even 
though it was set to open at 300 psig.
Carbon steel vessels are more tolerant of this sort of abuse than 
chrome steel vessels, which are more likely to rupture, especially at 
lower pressures. I suppose otherwise, something terrible might have 
happened.
The advantages of locating the high pressure alarm nozzle (PAH) 
and the pressure controller (PRC) on their own dedicated ¾-inch 
connections is that each device can be individually isolated, tested, 
and its nozzle cleared by the outside operator without interfering with 
the function of the relief valve. I have discussed these procedures in 
detail in my book, Troubleshooting Process Plant Control (Wiley, 2009).
What, you may wonder, did I do when I discovered that my depro-
panizer relief valve connection was plugged and that I had lost the over-
pressure protection for this vessel as a result? I should have shutdown 
the depropanizer. But this was a 25,000 BSD alkylation unit, the world’s 
largest alky unit. So I said nothing and continued to rely upon the 
principle that God protects the feeble-minded, and just kept running.
45.10  Heat Exchanger Safety Reliefs
Process heat exchangers are ASME coded pressure vessels with a 
MAWP (Maximum Allowable Working Pressure), just like any other 
vessel, for both the shell and tube sides. However, they normally are 
PRC
PAH

not protected from overpressuring by a relief valve. The small relief 
valves you may see located on the shell and channel head (tube side) 
are for thermal relief, not for excessive pressure due to accidentally 
exposing the exchanger to excessive upstream pump discharge pres-
sure (perhaps because a pump impeller was oversized). Such exchangers 
are legally protected from excessive pressure by their flange rating, and 
not by relief valves.
If you did not wish to provide the extra mechanical strength (i.e., 
the extra MAWP), then relief valves are required for heat exchangers. 
The same logic also applies for process piping. For instance, 150-psig 
piping has an MAWP of about 225 psig, depending on its temperature.
45.11  Relief Valve Effluents
The effluents from my sulfuric acid alkylation unit were strictly 
segregated:
• One system contained dry (water-free) acid-contaminated 
hydrocarbons.
• The second system was wet (acid-free) water-containing 
hydrocarbons.
The objective was to prevent corrosion in the relief valve headers 
flowing into the dual flare K.O. drums. I was always very careful, 
when adding new process services to the relief valve system, to adhere 
to this successful segregation scheme.
The designer should consider, when configuring the tie-ins to a 
relief header, any possible reactions between the effluent streams. 
On my alky unit, the reaction between strong H2SO4 (which is noncor-
rosive) and acid-free H2O will produce terribly corrosive weak H2SO4, 
which will destroy the welds in carbon steel piping in a matter of just 
a few days.
45.12  Maintaining Flare Header Positive Pressures
It is certainly required to maintain a positive pressure throughout the 
relief valve effluent piping system to preclude the entry of air, which, 
at least theoretically, could cause an explosion.
On many occasions in refineries, I have measured such pressures, 
which vary between perhaps 6 to 20 inches of water. There are two 
ways of maintaining such a positive pressure. The smart way and the 
dumb way.
45.12.1  Flare Water Seal
I’m sure you have seen the flame of a flare surging. That is not typi-
cally due to a relief valve opening periodically. It is due to periodically 
blowing the water seal in the flare seal pot (often located integral with 

	
592	
C h a p t e r  F o r t y - F i v e
the bottom of the flare stack). Using a long water bottle and a clear 
length of plastic tubing, I have monitored the variability in the back-
pressure from the water seal between 6 to about 18 inches of water. 
The 18 inches of water roughly correspond to the depth of the water 
seal, which holds back-pressure in the flare system.
At the request of one VP of refining in India, who found the flare 
flame surges objectionable, I reduced the depth of the water seal, and 
the intensity of the flame surges were thus reduced. But, of course, 
not the amount of hydrocarbons consumed.
Maintaining a water seal of about 10 inches of water in the flare 
seal drum is the smart way of preventing air intrusion into the relief 
valve collection system.
45.12.2  Flare Header Purge Gas
It is not uncommon for my clients to maintain a positive pressure in 
the flare system by continuously purging the most distant ends of the 
flare header piping with fuel gas, natural gas, or even propane. This 
is an expensive alternate to the water seal method I described above. 
It eliminates the need for the water seal and also the annoying sight 
of the pulsating flare flame. But to me it seems like a wasteful and, 
hence, dumb alternate.
But what I find even worse is the use of both options together. For 
what purpose, I cannot imagine. At least in every refinery I have 
worked in, there were sufficient relief valve leaks and unreported 
venting of hydrocarbons to keep the flare system under a higher than 
desired back-pressure. But, even without such leaks, the flare system 
would still be maintained positive just with the water seal.
In conclusion, please do not use both hydrocarbon purges and the 
flare stack water seal together. One or the other! Using both does not 
enhance plant safety and makes no engineering sense. I tried to 
explain all this to the refining VP referred to above, but to no avail.
45.13  Leaking Relief Valves
Many relief valves leak hydrocarbons to the flare. If the vessel with a 
leaking relief valve is operating at a substantial pressure (about 30 or 
40 psig), then the line downstream of the relief valve will be notice-
ably (perhaps 10°F) colder than the relief valve connection itself, due 
to a Joule-Thompson expansion.
If the vessel with the leaking relief valve is liquid full with light 
hydrocarbons (ethane, propane, or butane), then a leaking relief valve 
will be quite obvious. The line downstream of the faulty pressure relief 
valve will be covered with ice. The ice is atmospheric moisture freezing 
on the line to the flare. This is not due to a Joule-Thompson expansion, 
but due to the auto-refrigeration of the volatile hydrocarbon liquid as 
it flashes to a vapor in the flare header piping.

45.14  Tray Failure Due to Relief Valves
Relief valves are often placed toward the bottom of distillation towers. 
In particular on crude oil fractionators, relief valves are commonly 
located in the flash zone (i.e., at the feed elevation).
Many such columns are equipped with movable valve caps. If the 
relief valves open, the vapor flow through the trays will be reversed. 
This will seal the valve caps up against the tray panels. The large 
downward force exerted by the trapped vapors could then collapse 
the trays.
For such a tower, tray decks should be sieve or grid trays, and 
never valve cap trays. I will typically use a grid tray with a ½-inch lift. 
Also, using 10-gauge rather than 14-gauge trays (which is the industry 
standard) will double the tray resistance to collapse, due to the relief 
valves lifting at the bottom of the tower.
45.15  The Piper Alpha Rig Destruction
The Piper Alpha Oil Platform in the North Sea, about 100 miles from 
Aberdeen, Scotland, exploded and was destroyed by fire in July 1988. 
One hundred and sixty-five people were killed. I was hired by Occiden-
tal Petroleum, the operator of the platform, to write an independent 
report of the catastrophe. The basic cause of the incident was clearly the 
release of light hydrocarbons (propane, butane, pentanes) associated 
with a condensate flash drum located on the production platform.
Occidental’s investigation indicated that the accident was the 
result of two (now dead) pipe fitters not replacing a relief valve 
properly on a pump discharge line. My report was contradictory to 
Occidental’s conclusion and consisted of the following observations:
• A level instrument malfunction and/or operator error had 
resulted in a high liquid level in the separator vessel.
• The vessel overpressured and the relief valve opened.
• Light liquid hydrocarbons saturated with water (and perhaps 
some free water) flashed across the relief valve.
• The resulting auto-refrigeration caused the pressure relief 
line to the flare to plug with hydrates. Note that hydrates (an 
ice-hydrocarbon solid) will form at temperatures well above 
the freezing point of water.
• With the flare line plugged, the vapor-liquid separator vessel 
overpressured and failed (i.e., possibly a flange blew out).
To support my conclusion, I noted that the exterior of the flare 
line had been observed covered with ice shortly before the fire and 
that a high liquid level had been noted in the vessel that day. I sub-
mitted my report to Occidental, received payment by wire transfer, 
and never heard another word about my report from my client.

C h a p t e r  F o r t y - F i v e
This week I’m teaching at the Sasol coal-to-liquid plant in South 
Africa. They related an incident pertaining to a pressure relief line 
plugging with hydrates, due to steam leaking into a flare header, 
which contained liquid propane and propylene that were also leaking 
through a defective relief valve. It reminded me of my report to Occi-
dental pertaining to the Piper Alpha catastrophe all those long years 
ago. The lesson is that relief valves in light (propane and butane) liquid 
hydrocarbon service, where moisture may be present, create a poten-
tial for disaster due to the relief valve line totally plugging with hydrates.

CHAPTER 46
Corrosion—
Process Units
W
hat are the two most powerful corrosive agents in a process 
plant? Not acids or sulfur, or caustic or salt. Neither cyanides 
nor carbonates nor chlorides. The most aggressive corrosive 
agents are air and water. Nitrogen is inert. It is oxygen in an aqueous 
environment that is the main cause of many corrosion problems.
Rusty carbon steel pipe is the commonly encountered form of cor-
rosion due to air and water. Stainless steel appears to be immune to 
such corrosive attack, but this is not quite true. Stainless steel contains a 
substantial concentration of chrome and nickel. Common 304 stainless 
steel has 18 percent chrome and 8 percent nickel.
The chrome especially is subject to oxidation when exposed to wet 
air. But the metallic oxides so formed adhere tightly to the surface of the 
metal. This rugged metallic oxide layer acts as a barrier to prevent fur-
ther destructive oxidation of the base metal. The oxide layer is so thin 
that it is smaller than the wavelength of visible light. Thus, it is quite 
invisible to the human eye. Stainless steel piping appears shiny after 
years of service, even though its surface has been oxidized after just a 
few minutes of service.
Anyone who has ever painted a wrought iron fence to prevent rust 
appreciates the concept of a protective barrier. Aluminum and titanium 
are protected from corrosion due to the rapid formation of a surface 
metallic oxide layer, which tightly adheres to the metal surface.
The problem with ordinary carbon steel is that the oxide formed 
does not stick very tightly to the metal surface. The essence of corrosion 
control then is to manipulate process parameters so that a protective 
barrier of products of corrosion does adhere to the surface of carbon 
steel vessels and piping.
46.1  Closer to Home
I’ve just spent $8000 replacing my central air-conditioning system at 
my home in New Orleans. The outside condenser coils had corroded. 
Soil built up along the bottom row of tubes. The wet soil plus air over 
a 10-year period had caused a freon leak.
595

	
596	
C h a p t e r  F o r t y - S i x
The evaporator coils in my attic were also leaking. The condensate 
collection pan had not drained freely for the past five years. Conden-
sate had backed up and submerged the bottom tube of the evaporator 
and caused the tube to corrode and leak freon.
Lesson: Keep the outside of your home air-conditioner heat 
exchangers free of dirt and water, and the evaporator and condenser 
coils will last for 20-plus years.
46.2  Erosive Velocities
High-fluid velocity will tend to erode off the protective corrosion 
layer inside process piping. This exposes new, clean, and reactive 
metal to the corrosive oxygen and water. What is meant by erosive 
velocity? For aqueous systems with a few hundred parts per million 
(ppm) of particulates, an erosive velocity is
	
Erosive velocity (feet per second)
65
[Density]0.5
=
	
where density is expressed in pounds per cubic foot.
For example, dirty water (which has a density of 62 lb/ft3) would 
become erosive at about 8 ft/s. We sometimes design water pipes for 
velocities of 10 to 12 ft/s. That’s fine, provided the water is clean and 
noncorrosive. For dirty water, a design velocity of 5 to 7 ft/s would be 
better.
46.3  Mixed Phase Flow
When dealing with a vapor-liquid mixture, I assume the flowing 
velocity and density to be an average of both phases. As long as 
their combined velocity is above 15 ft/s, we can safely assume both 
phases are moving in what is called emulsified flow through the 
piping.
But what happens if a saturated liquid suddenly starts to boil 
inside a pipe? This is called cavitation. For example, hot water satu-
rated with air suddenly enters a section of smaller diameter piping. 
The resulting increase in velocity causes a reduction in flowing pres-
sure. The reduced pressure causes that water to boil violently. The tur-
bulence created by the generation of bubbles of steam combined with 
the oxygen cause rapid corrosion due to a combination of localized 
oxidation and localized erosion.
Be careful when hot water that has not been deaerated is used in 
a process plant. Cavitation failures in hot water piping systems are 
a common problem.

46.4  Carbonate Corrosion
My mother still thinks I’m very smart. Forty-eight years ago, I removed 
rust stains from our bathtub with Coca-Cola. It is the carbonic acid in 
Coke that removed the iron oxide rust stains from the tub. This is an 
illustration of the corrosive nature of carbonic acid brought into contact 
with ferric compounds. The carbonic acid is formed from CO2 dis-
solved in water.
I mentioned an example of how CO2 becomes concentrated in 
steam systems (see Fig. 12.6). Anytime CO2 starts to dissolve in water, 
carbonic acid will form, which has a relatively high pH as compared to 
other common minerals acids (sulfuric, hydrochloric, nitric acid). Actu-
ally, carbonic acid is aggressively corrosive to carbon steel at a pH of 
5.5. Sulfuric acid at a pH of 5.5 is only mildly corrosive to carbon steel.
CO2 is often produced by the chemical breakdown of calcium car-
bonate or sodium carbonate. CO2 is generated as a by-product of the 
production of hydrogen and ammonia. Processing of natural gas for 
pipe­line sales is another common source of CO2. The effluent from a 
sulfur plant or any combustion process contains wet CO2.
46.5  Naphthenic Acid Attack
Most crude oils contain some naphthenic acid. These acids tend to 
concentrate in those crude oil components that boil between kerosene 
and heavy gas oil. Naphthenic acid corrosion is characterized by a 
general thinning of stainless steel vessels and tower internals at tem-
peratures between 450 to 750°F. Rates of corrosion are greatly acceler-
ated in areas of high velocities. Naphthenic acid corrosion is retarded 
by H2S. Thus, process equipment containing hydrocarbons with 
higher sulfur contents are, to some degree, protected from naphthenic 
acid corrosion.
My experience indicates that stainless steels that have high chrome 
and nickel content are not very resistant to naphthenic acid attack. 
What is required is molybdenum. 304 stainless steel is unsuitable due to 
its low moly content. Even 316 stainless steel, which has about 2 percent 
moly, offers only marginal protection. I usually specify 317 stainless 
steel, which has about 3 percent moly, when designing for naphthenic 
acid services.
46.6  A Short History of Corrosion
From an operator’s perspective, corrosion appears to be a relent-
less, unavoidable, and gradual process. Pipes do rust and eventu-
ally fail, but the rust takes years to cause a failure. It is rather like 
cigarette smoking—clearly a deadly habit, but very slow to progress 
to disease.

	
598	
C h a p t e r  F o r t y - S i x
But this is not always the case. Corrosive failures sometimes 
appear suddenly. I have described below a few incidents from my 
experience to illustrate that corrosive failures can occur in a matter of 
hours, or even minutes, in the right (i.e., dangerous) environment.
46.6.1  Weak Sulfuric Acid Corrosion
It is 3:00 a.m. and I am fast asleep. The ringing phone drags me out of 
bed. It is Henry Zipperian, my not-so-wonderful shift foreman.
“We got a butane leak, Norm, on the reactor effluent line.”
“Well, what do you expect me to do about it? You’re the night-
shift foreman, Zip. Just handle it. Just don’t bother me.”
“Well,” Zip continued slowly, “you can’t see the west half of the 
alkylation unit. It’s covered in a butane fog. The butane cloud is 
drifting past the plant fence, out towards the state highway. If some-
one drives past and flips out a lit cigarette, we might just blow away 
half of Texas City.”
“Zip, can’t you isolate the leaking line from the reactors?”
“No good, Norm,” Zip sighed. “The effluent gate valves must be 
eaten up with acid too. I closed them all real tight, but they won’t hold. 
The whole reactor train is depressuring butane through the leak.”
A little mental math predicted that if the entire liquid content of all 
10 reactors vaporized through the leak, then a rather large vapor cloud 
would be formed. Actually, the volume of the reactors, settlers, 
exchangers, and piping contained 10,000 barrels of butane. If the entire 
10,000 barrels were to form a vapor cloud and ignite, the resulting det-
onation would approximate the force generated by the atomic bomb 
dropped on Hiroshima in 1945. The resulting destruction of Texas City 
would probably negatively impact my career at Amoco Oil.
Twenty minutes later, I was standing underneath an 8-inch line 
spewing a jet of liquid isobutane. I watched it flash to a white cloud 
in the warm Texas night. How had this happened? What had caused 
a sudden leak to develop on the new carbon steel line?
Figure 46.1 tells the tale. A faulty level indicator on the acid settler 
drum had caused the 90 percent sulfuric acid to carry over into the 
caustic settler drum. One pound of acid will neutralize 10 lb of the 
caustic solution. When I checked the pH of the circulating solution 
from the caustic settler, I measured a pH of less than 1. That is, the 
litmus paper turned red, not its normal blue.
Strong sulfuric acid above 85 percent strength is entirely noncorro-
sive. As the sulfuric acid is diluted with water, it becomes exponentially 
more corrosive to carbon steel. Small amounts of weak sulfuric acid were 
carrying over into the reactor effluent line from the caustic settler.
“But, Norm,” Zip said, “I wasn’t that worried about this acid 
carry-over. This has happened before. We’ve been running this unit 
for 30 years. The old 8-inch line, why, it lasted for 30 years. It never 
blew out like this. Just ’cause of a little acid carry-over. Norm, what 
are we going to do now?”

	
C o r r o s i o n — P r o c e s s  U n i t s

“Zip, the old lines were all stress relieved” (post-weld heat-
treated), I explained. “All the old piping spool pieces had been 
x-rayed. The new piping was welded just last week here in the plant. 
None of it was stress relieved and the integrity of the welds . . . 
Well, who knows? It is the heat-affected zones of the welds that are 
most subject to corrosive attack, especially on non–stress-relieved 
carbon steel piping. The lattice imperfections in the structure of the 
steel caused by melting (during welding), followed by rapid cool-
ing, causes hard spots to develop around the welds. Zip, these hard 
spots then create sites for the . . .”
“Norm,” Zip screamed. “Shut up. Stop making a speech. What 
the hell are we going to do now?”
“Don’t worry, Zip,” I replied. “Man proposes, but God disposes.” 
And suddenly divine intervention came to our rescue in the form of 
Ron Stover. Ron had returned from the storehouse with a pair of insu-
lated gloves, a screwdriver, and a handful of brass wood screws. Ron 
climbed up to the leak, stuck an appropriately sized screw into the 
blowing hole, and twisted the screw in. The leak stopped!
Welds often represent the weak point of both process piping, and 
more so process vessels. It is not actually the weld metal that is the 
problem. It is the area on either side of the weld. The steel was melted 
during welding and then refroze. The next true story is about a fail-
ure of a weld on a process vessel with a rather tragic ending. The 
names have not been changed to protect the guilty.
46.6.2  Hydrogen-Assisted Stress Corrosion Cracking
July 17, 1983, was a day that will live in infamy in the petroleum 
refining industry. On that day, 16 men and 1 woman lost their lives 
at the Unocal (now Citgo) Chicago Refinery (actually located in 
Lemont, Illinois). Months later, I was hired to investigate the cause of 
this terrible incident.

A liquid-liquid extraction tower broke in half. The detonation of 
the resulting cloud of hydrocarbons killed most of the victims.  
Figure 46.2 shows the process: the extraction of hydrogen sulfide by 
MEA (mono-ethanol-amine). A liquid propane stream containing 
3 percent hydrogen sulfide was being sweetened by contact with the 
MEA. Sweetening means the removal of an acidic component (hydro-
gen sulfide) by contact with an alkaline solvent (MEA).
The circulating MEA is a solution of 25 percent MEA and 
75 percent water. The solution is not corrosive in a carbon steel vessel.

wall thickness. Indeed, the Unocal vessel that failed after 15 years of 
service had not experienced any real loss of metal thickness. Yet, 
aqueous phase corrosion of steel exposed to wet hydrogen sulfide 
was the origin of the failure.
When iron reacts with hydrogen sulfide the following reaction 
takes place:
	
Fe + H2S → FeHS + H +	
(46.1)
The iron sulfide will eventually coat the wall of the vessel to form 
a protective layer and retard further corrosion, as previously 
described in this chapter.
The hydrogen ion is just a proton. Most of these protons react at 
the vessel wall to form molecular hydrogen:
	
H + + H + → H2	
(46.2)
The molecular hydrogen is dissolved in the propane and is of no 
further interest to us. If the formation of molecular hydrogen from the 
hydrogen ions at the vessel is retarded, however, then the hydrogen 
ions or protons dissolve into the steel walls of the vessel. That is, pro-
tons are soluble in steel, in the same sense that salt is soluble in water.
The protons will usually pass through the vessel wall, emerge as 
hydrogen and float away. But if the protons encounter an imperfec-
tion in the lattice structure of the steel, they will recombine at this 
imperfection into molecular hydrogen. The hydrogen so formed is 
then trapped inside the vessel wall.
The hydrogen molecules accumulate at the imperfection in the 
vessel wall. The pressure builds at this imperfection. Eventually, 
something has to relieve this pressure. Something has to give.
If the steel is ductile, the vessel wall will bulge internally and a 
hydrogen blister will form. It looks rather like a piece of plywood that 
has been soaked in water too long.
If the steel is hard, because it has lost its ductility, the vessel wall 
will crack. The crack will propagate along the hardened zone. The hard-
ened area is created when the heat-affected zone of a weld cools too 
rapidly without being post-welded (i.e., stress relieved) heat treated.
Cyanide salts are known to prevent the recombination of protons 
to molecular hydrogen at the vessel wall. These cyanides are supposed 
to be removed from the tower’s feed by extraction with thiosulfides 
in the upstream washwater. But Unocal was not adding any thio-
sulfides to their washwater.
Acetic acids are known to promote hydrogen ion penetration of 
vessel walls. Acetic acid is formed from the thermal decomposition of 
heat stable salts formed due to oxidation of the MEA. These heat stable 
salt precursors were supposed to be removed in an MEA reclaimer. 
But Unocal had not used the reclaimer unit for many months.
The cyanides and the acetic acid by themselves would not likely 
cause the vessel wall to crack. It was the concentration of hydrogen 

	
602	
C h a p t e r  F o r t y - S i x
sulfide in the MEA solution that may have been the main culprit. 
The moles of hydrogen sulfide divided by the moles of mono-
ethanol-amine is called the amine molal load. This amine load 
should be kept below 0.45. The amine load at the Unocal plant the day 
before the explosion was not accurately known. But it was definitely 
above 0.60 moles of hydrogen sulfide per mole of MEA.
Still, the vessel would not have failed if the vessel welds had been 
stress relieved by post-weld heat treatment. But this had not been 
done either.
Toward the end of the day, unit operators noted a small propane 
leak escaping from the circumferential weld (see Fig. 46.2). They 
sounded an alarm, and the fire crew, 16 men and 1 woman, turned 
out to stand by. Meanwhile the operators observed the crack spread-
ing around the vessel at the rate of a few inches per minute.
Within moments the vessel split in half. The upper portion was 
later found in a cornfield half a mile away. The propane cloud released 
drifted across to the fire truck and was ignited by the running motor. 
The ensuing detonation destroyed a good part of the refinery.
Of course, the cracked weld was not a result of corrosion that day, 
or that week, or that month. The crack was a result of hydrogen activity 
and pressure accumulation inside the vessel wall for the past decade. It 
was a result of 10 years of proton penetration of the vessel wall. How-
ever, the final effect appeared suddenly. That’s the nature of hydrogen-
assisted stress corrosion cracking.
46.6.3  Erosion-Corrosion Failure
Not very far from my home in Louisiana, Shell Oil (now Motiva) 
operates a large refinery. In 1988, an explosion occurred in this plant. 
A cloud of propane vapor from the overhead of a depropanizer deto-
nated with tremendous force. The resulting shock wave blew a 14-ft-
diameter tower off its foundation. The 100-ft-high tower landed on 
the control room. All six operators therein were killed.
One hundred and seventy lawyers from the surrounding parishes 
signed up 20,000 claimants to sue Shell Oil for damages due to gross 
negligence. The lawyers organized the “Plaintiffs Legal Committee,” 
which hired me to investigate the cause of the accident. Figure 46.3 
shows the point of failure.
About 15 years before the explosion, corrosion of the condenser 
tubes had caused a series of exchanger tube leaks. The cause of fail-
ure was thought by Shell to be due to acidic components (HCN, 
CO2, H2S) in the vapor phase. To combat the tube failures, two 
changes were made:
 
• The carbon steel tubes in the condenser bundle were 
changed to 304 stainless steel.
 
• A neutralizing ammoniated water injection stream was 
introduced through an injection quill, as shown in Fig. 46.3.

	
C o r r o s i o n — P r o c e s s  U n i t s 	
603
Question: If the carbon steel condenser tubes were failing due to 
acid attack, how about the carbon steel piping? Okay, maybe the pip-
ing upstream of the condenser was dry. After all, acidic vapor phase 
components in a water-free environment are not corrosive. No water 
was condensing upstream of the condenser. But once the waterwash 
injection was started, the carbon steel piping upstream of the con-
denser was wet.
But, dear reader, certainly the ammonia in the injection water 
would neutralize the acidic components as they dissolved in the water 
and rendered the water noncorrosive? This is both true and false.
The water was not injected through a spray nozzle into the pipe. 
Hence, the washwater was not dispersed. Only the periphery of the water 
was contacting the vapor phase. The major portion of the washwater 
remained basic due to the excess of ammonia dissolved in the water.

C h a p t e r  F o r t y - S i x
Only the peripheral area of the injected water came into intimate contact 
with the acidic vapor phase in the pipe. Hence, only this peripheral 
water became acidic as the ammonia in the water was neutralized by the 
H2S, CO2, and cyanides in the vapor.
You might think this is an interesting but unsupported theory. Not 
true. Referring again to Fig. 46.3, note that the point of failure was  
the elbow downstream of the injection quill. A section of the piping on 
the outer radius of the elbow failed (but the piece of steel that ripped 
off the piping remained partly attached to the piping). When I inspected 
the failed elbow, I found the pipe itself had suffered little loss in thick-
ness. The 6 by 15-inch piece of steel ripped away from the pipe was 
mostly just as thick as the pipe. But the edge of this 6 by 15-inch piece 
of steel was paper thin. The acidic water at the periphery of the water 
injection stream had cut a groove in the steel, and the pipe had failed 
around this groove.
46.6.3.1  Errors Promoting Erosion-Corrosion
The most serious error made by Shell was not dispersing the water 
into the pipe with full-cone spray nozzles. Other errors that may have 
contributed to the failure are:
•	 The injection water had not been deaerated. That is, it was 
just Missis­sippi River water that contained dissolved oxygen. 
Oxygen is highly corrosive to carbon steel.
• The water was injected in the direction of flow of the vapor. 
Also, the water was injected at the top of a vertical run of 
pipe. Both of these effects accelerated the velocity of water as 
it struck the vulnerable elbow. This promoted erosive forces.
• Nothing had been done to extract the hydrogen cyanides 
from the vapor. These cyanides are dangerous in that they 
promote hydrogen ion penetration of steel. They are best 
extracted from depropanizer feed by the use of thiosulfides 
upstream of the depropanizer. The thiosulfides should be dis-
solved in washwater, which will react with the HCN (but not 
the CO2 or H2S), and used to wash the depropanizer feed.
46.6.3.2  The Settlement
The case was settled out of court for $170 million. The seven principal 
lawyers on the Plaintiffs Legal Committee each cleared $8 million. 
I suspect that Shell Oil settled partly because they did not want to 
address the following question: If the carbon steel condenser tubes 
were failing due to corrosion, what was preventing the carbon steel 
piping upstream of the condenser from failure? It’s true that the pip-
ing was 0.25 inch thick, and the wall thickness of the condenser tubes 
was 0.1 inch. But this only means the piping would take longer to fail 
than the tubes.

46.6.4  Summary
Combating corrosive failures requires an understanding of chemistry, 
fluid flow, vapor-liquid equilibrium, and thermodynamics. Any time 
water, air, and acids get together and impact steel at a high velocity, rapid 
rates of metal loss can be anticipated. If cyanides are present, metal failure 
may be greatly accelerated. Failure rates are accelerated at locations 
where the crystal lattice structure of the steel has been distorted by welds 
which have rapidly cooled and then not reheated to remove stresses.
46.7  Corrosion—Fired Heaters
Sulfur is a common contaminate of fuel. For example, pipeline-quality 
natural gas may contain 20 ppm of hydrogen sulfide and mercaptains. 
Clean refinery fuel gas typically has 100 to 200 ppm of total sulfur. 
Number 2 furnace oil (at least in the United States) will have perhaps 
1000 ppm of sulfur. Heavy industrial fuel oil (No. 6 fuel oil or bunker 
fuel oil) may contain 6 percent (60,000 ppm) sulfur. About 90 percent 
of the sulfur in these fuels is converted to sulfur dioxide. However, 
about 10 percent is converted to sulfur trioxide (SO3).
As the flue gas cools, it will react with the water formed from the 
combustion of hydrogen in the fuel to produce sulfuric acid (H2SO4):
SO3 + H2O → H2SO4
The sulfuric acid may precipitate out of the flue gas as follows:
• 250°F, if the fuel had 100 ppm of sulfur
• 400° to 450°F, if the fuel had 6 percent (60,000 ppm) sulfur
Don’t take these temperatures too literally. In practice, the pre-
cipitation temperatures for sulfuric acid are higher by 50°F plus. The 
reason is that not all of the flue gas from the convective section of a 
heater is at a uniform temperature.
If the average flue-gas temperature in the stack is 300°F, then 
some of the flue gas will be cooler and some will be hotter. The cooler 
gas will then begin to precipitate sulfuric acid. This acid reacts with 
the convective section finned tubes to form iron sulfate. A thick, 
sticky, moist, acidic, grayish deposit will begin to plug the convective 
section tube bank. The flow of flue gas will be restricted. A reduced 
draft and a positive pressure will begin to develop in the firebox.
46.7.1  Stack Integrity
As I write this, I have just returned from a client’s plant. The stack on 
one of their heaters reminded me of the leaning tower of Pisa in Italy. 
The fuel gas to this heater sometimes has up to 10 percent hydrogen 
sulfide, with a stack temperature as low as 500°F. Sulfuric acid 
attacked the base of the stack and undermined its structural integrity. 

	
606	
C h a p t e r  F o r t y - S i x
Thus, disregarding environmental constraints, there are good reasons 
to limit the sulfur content of fuel gas.
46.7.2  Air Leaks
Air leaks in the convective section of a heater will reduce the concentra-
tion of SO3. However, this small beneficial dilution is of little impor-
tance compared to the cooling effects of the tramp air. Air leaks in any 
portion of a heater’s convective section or stack will promote localized 
precipitation of sulfuric acid, with resulting corrosion and fouling.
On the other hand, anything (even tramp air leaks) that increases 
excess air in the firebox will increase the convective section flue-gas 
temperature and dilute the SO3 in the flue gas. This will suppress 
sulfuric acid condensation and corrosion, but at the cost of reducing 
furnace fuel efficiency.
46.7.3  Air Preheaters
A typical fired heater combustion air preheater is shown in Fig. 46.4. 
Combustion air at a pressure of 5 inches of water is shown on the tube 
side. The flue gas is on the shell side, flowing at a draft of 2 inches of 
water. This air preheater is clearly leaking cold air into the flue gas. 
How do I know this?
The mass flow of flue gas is typically 10 percent greater than the 
mass flow of combustion air. Without air leaks, but with some ambient 
heat losses, the following should be approximately true:
• DT of flue gas equals DT of combustion air.
In Fig. 46.4, the temperature rise of the air is 300°F, while the tem-
perature drop of the flue gas is 500°F. The cold combustion is quench-
ing the hotter flue gas. About 50 percent of the air is leaking through 
the corroded tubes.
The cause of the tube leaks is cold flue gas. But the cause of the 
cold flue gas is tube leaks. The real cause of the tube leaks is sulfuric 
acid corrosion. The sulfuric acid condensation is the result of the low 
temperatures of the flue gas. To avoid this problem, the flue gas must 
not be cooled too much by the cold air.
Many air preheaters will have a steam preheat section to heat the 
combustion air by 60 to 80°F. While this may reduce the energy sav-
ings of the air preheater by 25 percent or more, my experience is that 
it’s an effective way to reduce air preheater tube leaks. This is espe-
cially true if the fuel has a few percent sulfur.
46.7.4  Plugged Air Preheaters
Cold air leaks promote exterior corrosion of the tubes shown in 
Fig. 46.4. The resulting corrosion deposits restrict the flow of flue gas 
and causes a positive pressure to develop in the firebox. This forces 
the operators to reduce air flow, which then reduces the temperature 

	
C o r r o s i o n — P r o c e s s  U n i t s 	
607
in the flue gas further. Also, the concentration of SO3 in the flue gas 
rises. Sulfuric acid attack is accelerated.
I have seen air preheaters with the flue-gas-side DP increase 
by 300 percent in just two years. This same preheater was leaking 
so badly that 60 percent of the combustion air was leaking directly 
up the stack through the preheater and thus bypassing the firebox 
and burners.
46.7.5  Reducing Air Preheater Failures
An air-side bypass around the preheater can be used to avoid over-
cooling the flue gas. Air preheat with steam upstream of the preheater 
is the most effective method to suppress leaks.
Ambient heat losses on the flue-gas side can be an important 
factor in promoting sulfuric acid condensation on smaller units. 
Ambient heat loss also decreases heater draft due to increased flue-
gas density in the stack.

46.8  Oil-Fired Heaters
In the radiant section of heaters or boilers, it’s not sulfur that causes the 
problem, but vanadium. All black residual fuel oils contain vanadium, 
along with some amount of sodium. It’s the sodium that causes the prob-
lem. The sodium forms a eutectic mixture with the vanadium.
When two metals mix together, such as sodium and vanadium, the 
melting point of the mixture is reduced below the melting point tem-
perature of the individual metals. This mixture is called a eutectic.
Residual fuel oils may contain 1000 ppm of vanadium and 10 ppm 
of sodium. When the fuel is combusted, the vanadium will deposit on 
the exterior of the radiant section tubes. The deposit is about 0.125 inch 
thick. It is a hard, but brittle scale that sloughs off easily from the radiant 
section tubes. It does no harm. Rather, the vanadium deposits protect 
the tubes from overheating, and flame impingement.
Unfortunately, at about 1250 to 1300°F the eutectic of 99 percent 
vanadium plus 1 percent sodium melts into a viscous, sticky liquid. At 
any higher temperature, the mixture will run off a tube without harm. 
At a lower temperature, it forms the thin protective solid I described. At 
1250 to 1300°F, a thick, uneven, and corrosive mixture (perhaps 1 inch 
in thickness) slowly eats away at localized areas of a furnace tube. The 
result is extremely localized tube thinning. I was mystified when I first 
saw such a tube in Aruba, until the local corrosion engineer explained 
the failure mechanism to me.
There are several things that can be done to combat this problem. 
Most effective is to avoid purchase of fuel oils with high sodium con-
tents. While vanadium in fuel oil cannot normally be controlled by the 
refiner (i.e., crude oil will contain an intrinsic amount of vanadium), 
the sodium content of fuel can be minimized by the refinery producing 
the residual oil.
An additive can be purchased from several suppliers (Nalco, Betz) 
that will prevent the vanadium scale from forming. While effective, 
the additive is expensive.
Perhaps the best and cheapest solution is to avoid flame impinge-
ment on radiant tubes. The 1250 to 1300°F temperature needed to 
melt the eutectic of vanadium-sodium is above the normal tube tem-
perature in most heaters. However, flame impingement can easily 
raise the exterior surface of a radiant tube above 1250°F.
Avoiding direct flame impingement does seem, in my experience, 
to help avoid the local corrosion associated with the vanadium-
sodium eutectic mixtures.
46.9  Finned-Tube Corrosion
Apparent corrosion of the fins in a convective section, whether gas- 
or oil-fired, is usually not due to sulfuric acid attack, but to oxidation. 
If the corrosion is due to sulfuric acid, a gray, sticky solid will be present. 

	
C o r r o s i o n — P r o c e s s  U n i t s 	
609
But if the fins have just become brittle enough to break off by hand, 
the problem is afterburn. The fins have simply been burned up by 
secondary ignition. While oxidation is a form of corrosion, we have 
discussed this problem in our chapter concerning the flue-gas side of 
fired heaters. (See Chap. 29.)
46.10  Field Identification of Piping Metallurgy
Without question, the most common single cause of fires in petroleum 
refineries is line failures due to excessive corrosion rates of piping of 
the wrong metallurgy. Usually, the error occurs during a turnaround 
or revamp. A piping section is replaced and one piping spool piece is 
fabricated from carbon steel when it should have been made of a 
high-chrome steel. Designed for 20 years of service, the piping then 
fails after just a single year. 
Usually, the spool piece that failed was covered with insulation 
and not visible. If an operator or engineer had been alert during the 
turnaround, the improper piping section could have been replaced.
We, as process personnel, are not metallurgists. Still, we should 
be prepared to discriminate between three types of materials:
• Carbon steel: Looks slightly rusty. Is magnetic.
• Chrome steel (400 series): Looks slightly less rusty with a 
gray tinge. Is magnetic. 
• Stainless steel (300 series): Looks more shiny than chrome 
steel. Is not magnetic.
The 300 series stainless steels contain nickel (316 and 317 also 
moly). The 400 series chrome steels are intended mainly to resist sul-
fur and high temperature. The 300 series steels have a greater range 
of chemical resistance. A handheld instrument is now available to 
discriminate between carbon steel, chrome steel, and different types 
of stainless steels.

CHAPTER 47
Waste Water 
Strippers
I
n 1965, my first assignment as a young process engineer for the 
American Oil Company was to design a waste water stripper to 
remove phenols, NH3, and H2S from refinery sour water. In 2012, 
somewhat older, I was troubleshooting two such sour water strippers 
in India. Neither of the strippers was working properly. Both were 
allowing excessive NH3 to be left in the stripped sour water and 
developing low stripping tray efficiency.
There are three ways to design refinery sour water strippers:
• The best way
• The wrong way
• The bad way
The two sour water strippers that I was troubleshooting in India 
both conformed to the bad method of process design.
47.1  Purpose of Sour Water Strippers
Refinery sour water originates largely from delayed coker, hydrode-
sulferizer reactor effluents, and catalytic cracker and visbreaker 
fractionators. The main contaminants are NH3 and H2S. Sour water 
stripper bottoms are reused in two places:
• Washwater for the crude unit desalter on a once-through 
basis to remove chloride salts that promote hydrochloric acid 
corrosion in the crude tower overhead condensers
• Makeup washwater for hydrotreater effluent recycle wash-
water to remove ammonia sulfide salts that plug downstream 
condensers and heat exchangers
When sour water stripper bottoms are used in the crude unit 
desalter, the NH3 should be about 10 to 20 ppm. Higher NH3 levels 
611

	
612	
C h a p t e r  F o r t y - S e v e n
interfere with crude unit corrosion control programs due to chlorides. 
I’ve explained this in greater detail in my book, Troubleshooting Process 
Operations, 4th ed. (PennWell). One hundred ppm of NH3 is excessive 
for desalter operation.
When sour water stripper bottoms are used as a makeup to 
hydrotreater effluent washwater, an NH3 content of a few hundred 
ppm is fine. After all, the recirculated washwater has over 10,000 ppm 
of NH3 anyway. Therefore, the NH3 content of the makeup washwa-
ter is not critical, as long as 90+ percent of the NH3 in the sour water 
stripper tower is stripped out.
47.1.1  The Bad Design
Figure 47.1 shows the conventional design used at most locations that 
I have visited in the past few decades. The operating conditions 
shown are typical of what I have observed recently at several refineries. 
The stripper feed is heated by feed/effluent exchanger with the strip-
per bottoms in exchanger E-1 (see Fig. 47.1). The reboiler duty (E-3) is 
required for the following three purposes:
• Heat the feed from 180°F to the 250°F tower bottoms  
temperature.
• Generate internal reflux at tray #32.
• Break the chemical bonds between water, NH3 and H2S, 
which are all endothermic reactions.
The reflux is generated in the E-2 circulating cooler. The reboiler 
duty is adjusted so as to control the moisture content (i.e., tempera-
ture) of the ammonia-rich gas flowing to the sulfur recovery plant 
thermal reactor. Too high a temperature will cause too much moisture 
in the sulfur plant feed. Too cool a temperature will cause NH3 salts 
to plug the vapor feed line to the sulfur plant.
This design never made much sense to me. Why preheat the feed 
onto tray 32 with E-1, and then remove this heat in E-2? Wouldn’t it 
have the same effect on the stripping trays to:
• Bring in the feed colder onto tray 32 (Fig. 47.1).
• Reduce the heat extracted in E-2, the circulating cooler, to offset 
the effect of the colder feed.
I suppose one could argue as to the effect on stripping efficiency 
for trays 30–32. However, a single-field measurement is worth a thou-
sand computer simulation calculations. I’ve tried shutting off the cir-
culating reflux (E-2) and bypassing the feed preheat exchanger (E-1) 
to maintain a constant reboiler duty and tower top temperature. The 
effect that I observed on the NH3 in the stripper bottoms was quite 
negligible. And why should it change? Will not the stripping factor 
(ratio of vapor to liquid) for the stripping trays remain unaltered?

My conclusion is that the preheat exchanger (E-1), the circulating

purpose. But don’t take my word for this. Try it on your own unit, as 
I did in Mumbai, India last week.

47.1.2   The Wrong Design
Figure 47.2 is really just as wrong, but not quite as wasteful a design 
as shown in Fig. 47.1. At least in this version, there are only  
16 trays rather than 40. My field observations indicate that a dozen or 
so stripping trays are sufficient to remove over 99 percent of the NH3 
from sour water and an even greater percentage of the H2S. Note that 
reducing the reflux drum temperature much below 165 to 170°F will 
result in salt plugging of the off-gas vapor line. The 190°F tower top 
temperature is likely a bit conservative and will result in increased

in the sulfur plant feed NH3 gas K.O. drum. Note that this water has 
to be recycled back to the sour water stripper for reprocessing.
The design shown in Fig. 47.2 was common in my youth (i.e., the 
1960s). However, it also suffers from the same heat balance draw-
backs and needless complications that I discussed for Fig 47.1. That 
is, a lot of equipment is added to generate reflux. This is very waste-
ful, as there is no fractionation required between the stripper feed 
and the overhead product. All we are trying to do is strip out the NH3 
and H2S. That’s why it’s called a sour water STRIPPER!
In 1969, while working for the Amoco International Oil Company 
in the United Kingdom, I designed a sour water stripper that elimi-
nated the unnecessary features of the unit shown in Fig. 47.2, which 
worked just fine.
47.1.3  The Best Design
Figure 47.3 shows the essentials of this 1969 design. Feed is brought in 
at essentially ambient conditions (70°F–100°F) from the sour water 
feed tank. To heat the feed from 90 to 250°F requires about 16 wt.% 
steam flow, or about 1.3 to 1.4 lb of steam per gallon of stripper bot-
toms. This value is close to a typical design stripping steam ratio for 
sour water strippers. The E-1 feed preheater, reflux pump (P-2), and 
reflux cooler (E-2) of Fig. 47.2 are all eliminated. How, then, do I know 
that the design shown in Fig. 47.3 will work? Because it was built this 
way (at Milford Haven in Wales) in 1970, and it worked as well as the 
conventional design shown in Fig. 47.2.
But why hasn’t this simple process design configuration been 
adopted by the industry in the last 40 years? For those of you who 
have read my other books, you will find that the answer is that there 
is no answer.
47.2  Two-Stage Sour Water Stripper
Figure 47.4 shows a sour water stripper with a side draw-off. Partly 
stripped water is extracted from tray #8 and is directed to the 
hydrotreaters for use as makeup water in the ammonia salt removal 
step of the desulferizer reactor effluent. Completely stripped water 
from the sour water stripper bottoms is sent to the crude unit desalter. 
I designed such a modification for the former Coastal Corporation in 
Aruba, but I don’t know if it was ever installed. However, this is just 
a direct application of the “Lean, Semi-Lean Amine Regeneration 
Design” that is often used in the natural gas industry to save energy 
(see my book, Troubleshooting Natural Gas Processing). I have designed 
such two-stage rich amine regenerators, which is quite conventional 
technology, with the objective of producing a very low residual H2S 
content in the lean amine solvent, at the expense of a higher residual 
H2S content in the semilean amine solvent.

47.3  Tray Efficiency
For one of the sour water strippers I worked on in India, the NH3 in 
the bottoms product was about 200 ppm, even though the NH3 in the 
feed was only 1000–2000 ppm. My client felt, and correctly so, that

the 200 ppm of NH3, precluded the use of this sour water stripper 
bottoms as a crude unit desalter washwater. Thus, the water flowed 
directly into the refinery effluent treatment plant.
The problem was not the lack of stripping steam. The problem 
was also not the excessive pH of the stripper bottoms as my client in 
India suspected. It is quite normal for the stripper bottoms to have a 
higher pH than the feed, if the stripping efficiency is inadequate. That 
is, the acidic H2S is stripped out of the sour water more easily than the 
basic ammonia. The problem of excessive NH3 in the stripped water 
effluent was low tray efficiency.

Climbing up this tall tower with far too many trays (see Fig. 47.1) 
(I’m more aware of such overdesigned towers at age 70 than I used to 
be), I observed:
• The delta P across the bottom 32 trays was zero. Meaning 
there were no intact trays.
• The delta P across the top 8 trays was 7 psig (or about 16 ft of 
water—which equaled the vertical height of the tower above 
the chimney tray shown in Fig. 47.1. Meaning that trays 33–40 
were totally flooded.
I advised my client as follows:
• Do not use valve or flutter cap trays. The valve caps stick to 
the tray deck and promote high-pressure drop and flooding. 
Use a grid tray with a one-half-inch cap lift. Pro-valves are a 
good option. 
• Bolt the trays to the tray ring, or use back-to-back trays with 
shear clips (see my book, Process Design for Reliable Operations, 
for mechanical details). This will help to avoid tray failures 
due to pressure surges caused by high liquid levels.
In the Coastal Refinery in Aruba, we used sieve trays with one-
half-inch holes, which seemed to work fine. Avoid packed towers. 
They are subject to vapor-liquid channeling and poor fractionation 
efficiency due to sloppy installation, fouling, or poor liquid feed dis-
tribution. When calculating the required hole area for the trays, don’t 
forget that the vapor loads and hence the required tray hole area will 
substantially diminish as the vapor flows up the column from the 
reboiler to the feed tray. This will normally require a reduction in the 
tray deck hole area in proportion to the reduced vapor flow rate.
47.4  Computer Simulation and Theoretical Tray 
Efficiency
A rather detailed and complete article on sour water stripper tray 
efficiency was published in 2012.1 It compares three ways of looking 
at tray efficiency for stripping NH3 out of water (reference 1):
• Murphree vapor efficiency
• Overall tray efficiency
• Mass transfer tray efficiency
In general, according to this reference, stripping efficiency for NH3 
is 40 percent. For H2S it’s quite variable. However, H2S is so easily 
stripped out of water, compared to NH3, that this variability for H2S 
stripping is not important.

	
W a s t e  W a t e r  S t r i p p e r s 	
619
The problem with this sort of approach to tray efficiency is that it 
is largely irrelevant. The main problems we have with tray efficiency 
in sour water strippers are:
• The trays are not level.
• The weirs are not level.
• The valve caps are sticking to the tray decks or blown off.
• The trays are corroded through.
• The tray decks have been blown out due to misoperations.
• Trays are leaking because the deck hole area is excessive for a 
given vapor rate.
Of course, no one could take into account such factors. They are 
unknown. But what is known is the performance of existing sour water 
strippers in pretty much identical services. There are decades worth of 
operating data available for sour water strippers. I helped design a 
sour water stripper in 1965 (with dumped ceramic packing, which did 
not work) for American Oil. It’s far safer to design a new sour water 
stripper based on a prototype than on a purely theoretical basis.
However, Reference 1 does contain a useful analysis of a factor 
that I have often thought about. That is, the trade-off between steam 
consumption and the number of trays. From Fig. IV of the reference, 
note that increasing the number of stripping trays from 18 to 32 
reduces reboiler steam consumption by 23 percent for the same NH3 
concentration in the stripped water.
I suppose this is a good argument (from the designer’s perspec-
tive) to design sour water strippers with 30 trays. However, from the 
unit engineer or operator’s perspective, it illustrates the potential 
energy savings from maintaining the stripper trays in good mechani-
cal condition and to ensure tray deck levelness. That is to say that if 
trays are in good mechanical condition and properly installed so that 
they work as intended, then one would need less reboiler steam.
47.5  Use of Caustic to Improve Stripping
I was working on a smaller crude unit in Alabama to improve 
desalter efficiency. Their problem was the periodic carry-over of 
emulsified brine. The depth of the emulsion between the crude and 
water phases in their desalter was excessive. The pH of the washwa-
ter from the sour water stripper was 8½ to 9, even though the NH3 
content of the stripper bottoms was zero. Talking to the operators,  
I discovered that they added NaOH to the sour water stripper feed to 
diminish the NH3 content of the stripped water.
Caustic contamination of the desalter washwater is known to pro-
mote high desalter vessel emulsion levels. There are dozens of refer-
ences to this problem in my favorite source of technical information. 

	
620	
C h a p t e r  F o r t y - S e v e n
That is, the old back issues of the NPRA Q&A (i.e., The National Petro-
leum Refiners Associated, Question and Answer) sessions. With this 
authoritative source as support, I asked the operator to stop the NaOH 
addition to his sour water stripper feed. Two hours later, at the same 
reboiler duty, the NH3 content of the stripped sour water had gone 
from 0 to about 5 ppm. And the emulsion layer in the crude unit 
desalter had been reduced enough so that brine carry-over was no 
longer a problem. The 5 ppm of ammonia was quite acceptable.
Caustic addition to the sour water stripper feed will increase NH3 
stripping efficiency by reducing the solubility of NH3 in water. This 
may be a good practice if the stripper bottoms is flowing into the refin-
ery effluent treatment basin. But I would rather have 10–20 ppm NH3 
in the sour water stripper bottoms than contaminate my desalter with 
NaOH, which promotes the formation of brine–crude oil emulsions.
“Why then, Mr. Lieberman, were we using caustic in our sour 
water stripper all these years?” asked the young operator. “That caus-
tic’s expensive.”
“The answer, son,” I explained, “is that there is no answer.”
47.6  Water Stripper Reboiler Corrosion and Fouling
One of the questions that I am often asked is what can be done to 
mitigate reboiler tube failures in sour water strippers and the conse-
quent steam leaks into the stripped sour water?
One helpful suggestion is to avoid the use of kettle reboilers or 
once-through thermosyphon reboilers, in favor of circulating thermo-
syphon reboilers. That is, feed the reboiler directly from the bottom of 
the stripper and design for about a 10% to 20% vaporization rate (see 
Fig. 47.3). This will reduce, but unfortunately not eliminate, the reboiler 
tube failures by maintaining more liquid flow across the tubes.
I have a simpler suggestion, if you can meet the following process 
limitations:
	
1.	 The stripped water flows to the crude unit desalter and/or 
the hydrotreater effluent washwater makeup.
	
2.	 External water is required to supplement stripped sour water 
to the above units. That is, the plant’s sour water stripper bot-
toms is not sufficient for the total washwater requirements.
My suggestion is to use open steam in the stripper bottoms and 
abandon the reboiler. This will increase the stripper bottoms water 
flow by 10% to 20%. But this will also be offset by the diminished 
freshwater makeup rate to the desalter or hydrotreater effluent wash.
I would estimate that half of my clients use open stripping steam 
and have discarded their reboilers. Or they are operating with mas-
sively leaking reboiler tubes, which is really pretty much the same 
thing as open stripping steam.

	
W a s t e  W a t e r  S t r i p p e r s 	
621
Referring to Fig. 47.3, for many refinery operations, the circulat-
ing thermosyphon reboiler shown can be eliminated and replaced 
with the same quantity of stripping steam, thus further simplifying 
the design of your waste water stripper installation.
For many waste water strippers used in refinery services, rapid 
rates of reboiler fouling are experienced, not due to corrosion, but as 
a consequence of heavy hydrocarbon sludge, that settles out in the 
bottom of the sour water stripper feed tank. In particular, slurry oil 
that is produced in a refinery catalytic cracking unit can accumulate 
in the stripper’s feed tank. This slurry oil, being denser than water, 
settles out in the tank and eventually is drawn into the suction of the 
sour water stripper feed pump. The heavy hydrocarbon phase then 
accumulates in the stripper’s reboiler, and with time and temperature 
fouls the reboiler’s tubes.
I solved this problem at the Mobil Oil Refinery in Coryton (United 
Kingdom) by elevating the suction nozzle for the pump on the sour 
water storage tank a few feet above the tank’s bottom drain. A more 
common solution would have been to use a floating suction inside 
the tank.
47.7  Ballast Water Stripper
Benzene is quite soluble in sea water. Thus, crude tankers produce 
ballast water with high benzene contents, which should be stripped 
out before the ballast water is drained to the sea. I was working 
with a refinery in Baytown, Texas, on such a waste water stripper. It 
was a new facility that was not effectively achieving its design func-
tion of rejecting the benzene to an oxidizer. I’ve published the 
details in the Oil and Gas Journal (July 18, 1994, pp. 51–54). The story 
illustrates that no matter how good the design, confused operators, 
supported by inexperienced engineers, can ruin the performance of 
a waste water stripper.
47.8  Conclusions
Generally accepted designs in the refining industry are not necessar-
ily correct. The application of basic chemical engineering principles 
such as the stripping factor can often lead to simpler, more cost-effective 
designs. Avoid the use of flutter cap-type valve trays in fouling ser-
vices. The caps will stick to the tray deck and cause flooding. The 
high pH of stripped sour water is a symptom of poor stripping efficiency, 
not the cause. Preheating sour water stripper feed normally serves no 
purpose. Avoid the use of caustic if the stripped water is to be reused 
as the crude unit desalter washwater as it will promote an emulsion. 
A refinery sour water stripper should have about a dozen trays, not 
40. Best to use grid or sieve trays, rather than random-type packing 
(i.e., rings) in the tower. If high turndown rates are required, use

bubble caps rather than perforated or valve tray decks. For many 
locations, the bottoms reboiler may be replaced with open stripping 
steam. The principles that I have discussed for refinery sour water 
strippers also apply directly to waste water strippers in general.

CHAPTER 48
Fluid Flow in Pipes
Basic Ideas to Evaluate Newtonian  
and Non-Newtonian Flow
W
e have spent a lot of time in this book so far discussing the 
movement and processing of fluids through different types 
of equipment, but how is the process fluid conveyed from 
one piece of equipment to another?
In general the answer is, “It is carried by pipes,” and in most cases 
the pipes are circular cross-section and made from carbon steel.
48.1  Field Engineer’s Method for Estimating Pipe Flow
One day I asked Norman how he would calculate the pressure loss 
for flow through circular cross-section pipes—the sort of pipes that 
are used throughout most process plants that we work in. I felt sure 
he would have some simple method. Here is the method with an 
example of its use for a pressure drop survey, more or less as he gave 
them to me.
48.1.1  Low-Viscosity Liquids and Vapors in Turbulent Flow
The pressure drop (DP) for fluids flowing through pipelines of any 
diameter may be approximated by the following formula. I’ve 
checked this correlation in the field. Caution! This formula only 
applies if viscosity is low and flow is turbulent. By low viscosity,  
I mean something less than 2 or 3 cP, or perhaps 10 SSU (seconds 
Saybolt universal). Water, warm diesel oil, and hot gas oil all fall 
within this category.
Also please note that this formula assumes the pipes are reason-
ably smooth steel. Norman says that if he is dealing with older cast 
iron pipes in water service or other services that promote corrosion 
deposits, scaling, or surface roughness, he increases the calculated DP 
by 20 percent. If the piping has many elbows, fittings, and valves, he 
623

increases the calculated pressure drop by 50 percent. If the piping has 
a reducer, he treats the reducer as if it is a nozzle.

Caution: This equation only holds for turbulent flow when 
expressed in the following units. It was derived from charts used to 
size industrial piping systems. It is designed to provide a conservative 
high value for pressure drop. To verify that the flow is turbulent, refer 
to Sec. 48.3.3.

48.2  Field Pressure Drop Survey
An engineer has been assigned to check a kerosene process line for DP. 
The chief operator suspects the line is partly plugged (see Fig. 48.1):
	
1.	 Kinematic viscosity of kerosene is 0.6 cSt. Therefore, viscosity 
is not a critical factor because it is less than 5 to 10 cSt.
	
	   Note that centistokes = centipoise divided by density. The 
density in this case is approximately 0.9g/cm3.

	   Note that the 2.31 factor is the height in feet of a column of 
water that will exert a pressure equal to 1 psi, and atmo-
spheric pressure 14.7 psi is equivalent to a height of approxi-
mately 30 ft of water.
	
4.	 The actual flowing pressure loss corrected for elevation is then:
	
40 psi - 17 psi = 23 psi	
	
5.	 The 6-inch diameter line has a short 2-ft long restriction where 
the pipe size is reduced to 3-inch diameter (see Fig. 48.1). Line 
lengths this short (i.e., 2 ft) can be treated as a nozzle as follows:

	   The 0.34 is a nozzle-loss coefficient. The 20 ft/s is the veloc-
ity of the kerosene in the 3-inch restriction. The 28 factor con-
verts DP from inches of water pressure drop to psi.
	
	   The DP over the 3-inch restriction is 4 psi.
	
6.	 The remaining DP due to friction loss in the 6-inch line is then: 
23 psi - 4 psi = 19 psi.
	
7.	 To calculate the pressure drop in the 6-inch line per 100 ft of 
line, first find the linear flow rate of the kerosene in ft/s.

ficient so that the DP in psi is expressed as DP per 100 ft of line.
	
	   The DP per 100 ft of line is then 0.5 psi.
	
8.	 For 4000 ft of pipeline, the DP is found from:
	
          DP (due to friction) = 0.5 × 4000/100 = 20 psi	
	
9.	 There are only two elbows in this line. Hence I have neglected 
losses due to fittings in the long (4000-ft) line. This is not usu-
ally the case, in fact frictional loss due to fittings can sometimes 
double the frictional loss for straight run pipe. For further 
information on estimating friction losses due to fittings,  
consult Crane Co. Technical Paper No. 410 or your Cameron 
Data Book.1–3

picked out some typical fittings and shown the equivalent 
length of straight pipe, in terms of pipe diameters, needed to 
produce the same frictional loss as the fitting for fluids in turbu-
lent flow.
	
	   Conclusion: The DP due to friction (20 psi), is about the same 
as the corrected (step 6) DP of 19 psi. Therefore, there is no 
pluggage in the kerosene pipeline and everything is quite 
normal.
Norman notes that this simple flow calculation can only be used 
for viscosity fluids of less than about 3 cP. It is a simple equation that 
he has found useful in oil refineries where flow is usually turbulent 
and pipes are made from carbon steel. However, unless you are 
quite sure that the flow is turbulent, it would be better to check the 
flow conditions in the pipe before proceeding. A pipeline that nor-
mally has turbulent flow may have laminar flow, for example, if flow 
rate is cut back, perhaps by closure of one or more of the plants 
which it is feeding. There may also be changes in temperature or 
even pressure which could affect the viscosity of the flowing fluid. 
The later sections in this chapter should help you assess the flow 
condition in the pipe.
It is true that in oil refineries and many chemical plants the fluids 
conveyed in pipes frequently fall within this low-viscosity category 
(less than 2 or 3 cP). Even materials we might expect to be more vis-
cous, like the heavier hydrocarbon fractions such as atmospheric and 
vacuum-tower bottom products, do have quite low viscosity when 
pumped because it is normal practice to heat them up until the vis-
cosity is low in order to make it easier to pump them. The pipelines 
are then insulated and “steam traced” to keep these heavy fluids hot 
and at acceptably low viscosity.
48.3  Line Sizing for Low-Viscosity and Turbulent Flow
Just as we used this simple formula:

earlier in this chapter to evaluate pipeline pressure drop, we can also 
use this same formula to check line sizes for low-viscosity fluids (less 
than 3 cP) in turbulent flow. The expected loss in pressure for 100 
equivalent ft of horizontal pipe should be between 0.1 and 1.0 psi. If 
you find that the expected DP per 100 equivalent ft of horizontal pipe is 
more than 1.0 psi, then we would propose an increase in pipe diame-
ter that would bring the DP per 100 equivalent ft within the range of 0.1 
to 1.0 psi. The converse is also true. However, if you are designing new 
pipe work, you should aim for 1 psi per 100 ft.

	
628	
C h a p t e r  F o r t y - E i g h t
Note that our choice of standard pipe diameter becomes more 
restricted for larger diameter pipe, where the increments of standard 
pipe diameter are greater than for small diameter pipes.
Well, I suppose that was easy enough to follow. Let’s just back-
track a little now so that we can put the information we have had so 
far in its proper context. Certainly that equation for P is simple 
enough to use, but how do we know if it is really valid for the fluid 
and the flow we are dealing with? How do we know if the fluid is in 
turbulent flow, and for that matter, what is turbulent flow anyway? 
Why are most fluids piped and pumped in turbulent flow? To answer 
these questions, we have to back track a little, and so we should. Don’t 
panic. Although there are many excellent and far, far more complete 
texts on this subject (to some of which we will refer), we will now 
attempt to give you a thumbnail sketch or “working guide.”
48.3.1  Not All Fluids Are Created Equal
Low-viscosity materials such as we have been discussing in the previ-
ous section have flow behavior that has been classified as “Newtonian,” 
because at constant temperature and pressure the fluid has constant vis-
cosity, irrespective of the way in which the fluid is flowing. Other types 
of fluid that we will look at more closely later do not follow this straight-
forward flow behavior, but may exhibit varying apparent viscosity 
depending on the amount of shear used to move the fluid or even exhibit 
some kind of yield stress which must be overcome before they can begin 
to flow. Such fluids are known collectively as “non-Newtonian.”
Let us return to the discussion on Newtonian fluids. By the way, it 
is worthwhile to remember that liquids and gases are both thought of 
as fluids.
48.3.2  Flow Regimes in Newtonian Fluids
Early pioneering work by Reynolds in 1883 showed evidence of two  
distinctly different types of flow patterns or “flow regimes,” in circu-
lar cross-section pipes. Reynolds used a glass pipe immersed in a  
constant-temperature water bath fitted with a quill to introduce a single 
filament of colored water at the center line of the glass pipe.
At low flow rates he found that the thin, colored stream remained 
intact close to the center line of the pipe (see Fig. 48.3a), indicating

what we now understand to be laminar or streamline flow, which 
characteristically prevents much movement of the fluid in any direc-
tion except in the direction of flow parallel to the pipe. This means that 
there is very little mixing of the fluid as it flows, in laminar flow.
As flow rate was increased, the thin stream of colored water in 
the center of the pipe would begin to waver and oscillate back and 
forth across the pipe. The flow rate at which this occurred would vary 
according to the pipe diameter. Eventually, as flow continued to be 
increased, the colored filament would break up altogether (see  
Fig. 48.3b). The final stage of this flow development where the 
colored filament breaks up altogether and disappears we nowadays 
understand to be an illustration of fully developed turbulent flow. 
The existence of eddy currents randomly distributed across the 
whole cross-section of the pipe causes effective mixing throughout 
the fluid as it flows in all but a very narrow layer of stationary fluid, 
termed “the laminar sublayer,” which persists next to the wall of the 
pipe itself (see Fig. 48.4).
The initial wavering and oscillations of the filament show that 
the laminar flow pattern is breaking down as eddy currents start to 
develop within the flowing fluid causing mixing of the fluid as it 
flows along the pipe. Note that the point at which the laminar flow 
begins to break up and become fully turbulent, as flow increases, is 
quite variable. We refer to this flow regime as transitional, or the

critical zone, which gets its name from our use of the term “critical 
flow rate” to identify the particular flow rate that provoked turbu-
lent flow for a given fluid in a particular pipe at certain temperature, 
pressure, and viscosity. Note that the onset of transitional flow 
depends on a number of parameters.4
48.3.3  The Importance of the Reynolds Number
Reynolds realized that it was not only the diameter of the pipe that 
affected the flow rate at which flow became transitional but also 
that this occurred at lower flow rates when the fluid was hot because 
the fluid would then have a lower viscosity. These considerations led 
Reynolds to develop the now-famous Reynolds number, which we 
may write as “Re,” and which of course has become very important 
in the study of fluid flow. The Reynolds number for any given flow 
condition has the same dimensionless value, whichever set of con-
sistent units is employed.

In the foot-pound-second or fps system (which is ft–lb(mass)–s), 
the Reynolds number is properly calculated using the following units:
	
Re = Reynolds number, a dimensionless quantity
	 ID = Internal diameter of the pipe, ft
	
V = Linear velocity of the fluid at flowing temperature and 
pressure, ft/s
	
D = Density of the fluid at flowing temperature and pressure, lb/ft3 
(that is, lb (mass)/ft3)
 
 = Viscosity of the fluid at flowing temperature and pressure,  
lb/ft × s (that is, lb (mass)/ft × s)
If you are intimidated by the prospect of the conversion of a vis-
cosity quoted to you in the ubiquitous centipoise, or cP (which, like a 
cuckoo, has found its way into the American system of units but 
really belongs to a version of the centimeter-gram-second system), let 
me just show you this:
	100 cP = 1 poise = 1g/(cm × s)	
	
1 cP = 0.01 [(1 g)-1 (1 cm)-1 (1 s)-1]	
	
= 0.01 [((1/453.6) lb)+1 × ((1/30.48) ft)-1 × (1 s)-1]	
 
= 0.01 [(1/453.6) × 30.48 × 1] lb ft-1 s-1	
	
1 cP = 6.72 × 10-4 lb/ft s	
Incidentally, the viscosity of water at 20°C is conveniently approxi-
mately equal to 1 cP. However, the poise unit of viscosity itself was 
actually named after the French physician Poiseuille, who was study-
ing blood flow and conducted extensive experiments on flow in tubes

around 1840. Note that any consistent set of units will by definition 
provide unit acceleration to unit mass by the application of unit force. 
Table 48.1 provides comparative information for the SI, cgs, and 
engineering systems of consistent units.
The Reynolds number is a characterizer of flow type, being pro-
portional to the ratio of the momentum of the fluid to the viscosity of 
the fluid. The Reynolds number also accounts for the fact that, 
whereas increases in momentum tend to push the fluid into turbulent 
flow, increases in viscosity or increases in viscous forces tend to slow 
up and straighten out the flow pattern.
In general, it is normal for the flow to start to change from lami-
nar to transitional at Reynolds numbers of about 2000, and for flow 
to be turbulent at Reynolds numbers of above 3000. However, the pre-
cise point at which the transition will take place depends also on the 
roughness with respect to diameter (and geometry) of the pipe. There is 
no such thing as stable transitional flow.
It is also useful to note that a turbulent flow can become laminar 
if, for example, it passes into a larger diameter pipe where the Reyn-
olds number is then less than 2000. We are also aware that in some 
cases unstable laminar or transitional flow has been determined for 
Reynolds numbers as high as 40,000, although flow at Reynolds num-
bers above 3000 will usually revert to being turbulent if the fluid expe-
riences even a very small force applied at right angles to the pipe axis.
Take a look at Table 48.2 to see the effect on Reynolds numbers of 
changing the diameter of smooth pipes for a fixed volumetric flow 
rate at ambient conditions. Low-viscosity fluids are often pumped in 
turbulent flow simply because it would require such a large diameter 
pipe to maintain laminar flow that the increased cost (caused by the 
larger diameter) would be more than the savings generated by lower 
frictional losses in laminar flow.

The volumetric flow rate ft3/s used to compile Table 48.2 was selected 
to give a linear flow rate in the 2-inch diameter pipe of 3 ft/s. Linear 
flow rate (ft/s) for flow in pipes is calculated by dividing the volumetric 
flow rate (ft3/s) by the internal cross-sectional area (ft2) of the pipe.
48.3.4  Shear Rate, Shear Stress, and Viscosity 
in Newtonian Fluids
All flowing fluids experience shear, which arises from the way in which 
the velocity of the fluid increases as the distance from the stationary 
surface over which it is flowing increases. For flow in pipes, this is the 
distance (y) from the inside edge of the pipe wall. (See Figs. 48.5a and b.) 
The rate at which the velocity changes with respect to distance from the 
pipe wall is called the shear rate (), and is measured in reciprocal sec-
onds, s-1 (where [ft/s]/ft = s -1).

The force per unit area of pipe surface exerted upon the liquid as 
a result of this velocity gradient is called the shear stress (R), and is 
measured in lb/ft s2 (or poundal per square foot).
The ratio of shear stress force per unit area to shear rate is a con-
stant for a Newtonian fluid (at constant temperature and pressure) and 
is called the viscosity, or sometimes also known as the shear viscosity 
(), and is measured in lb/ft s.

Viscosities of liquids are generally orders of magnitude higher 
than for gases, and the viscosity of liquids will reduce as temperature 
increases, whereas the viscosity of gases will increase with increased 
temperature (but more slowly than liquid viscosity decreases). The 
higher the viscosity of the fluid at ambient conditions, the greater 
the rate of decrease in viscosity with temperature, for example, the 
viscosity of water will decrease by about 1.5 percent per 1°F at room 
temperature, motor oil will decrease by about 3 percent per 1°F, and 
bitumen will decrease by about 8 percent per 1°F.
Changes in pressure also affect viscosity, with increased pressure 
causing increased viscosity, although in most cases the effects are less 
noticeable than with changes in temperature.
For example, increases in pressure from normal atmospheric 
pressure to 1000 atmospheres will cause viscosity to approximately 
double, further increase in pressure to 2000 atmospheres might 
cause a tenfold increase, and increases to 4000 atmospheres could 
cause a 100-fold increase in viscosity. This relationship between vis-
cosity and pressure becomes important for such applications as  
the lubrication of gears in a car engine where, for very short periods, 
the pressure between points of contact is enormous and can raise the 
lube oil viscosity at those points for these short times to as high as 
that of bitumen.5
48.3.5  Kinematic Viscosity
The quantity known as kinematic viscosity (kv), which we frequently 
see expressed in centistokes is the viscosity , as described above 
divided by the fluid density as follows.

Kinematic viscosity
Viscosity
Density
	
	
= µ
kv
D 	
where kv = kinematic viscosity, ft2/s
	
 = viscosity or shear viscosity, lb/ft s
	
D = density, lb/ft3
Caution: Some texts will show you that the kinematic viscosity 
in centistokes is equal to the viscosity in centipoise divided by the 
specific gravity. This can be numerically correct only for centipoise 
and centistokes because the density of water (to which the specific 
gravity of all liquids is related) in the cgs system is 1 g/cm3, which 
is numerically equal to the specific gravity of water, which is also 
1.0 at standard conditions. It would be far better practice to use den-
sity throughout and be certain to use consistent units in all your 
calculations.

	
F l u i d  F l o w  i n  P i p e s 	
635
We also note that because of the higher density the kinematic vis-
cosity for a liquid is typically much lower than for a gas at atmospheric 
pressure. At 70°F and atmospheric pressure, the kinematic viscosity for 
water is about 1.1 × 10-5 ft2/s, compared to 1.7 × 10-4 ft2/s for air.4
48.4  Frictional Pressure Loss in Rough and Smooth Pipe
We now have to thank Stanton and Pannell, and also Moody, for their 
studies of flow using numerous fluids in pipes of various diameters and 
surface roughness and for the evolution of a very useful chart (see  
Fig. 48.6). This chart enables us to calculate the frictional pressure loss in a 
variety of circular cross-section pipes. The chart plots Reynolds numbers 
(Re), in terms of two more dimensionless groups: a friction factor , which 
represents the resistance to flow per unit area of pipe surface with respect 
to fluid density and velocity; and a roughness factor e/ID, which repre-
sents the length or height of surface projections relative to pipe diameter.

this to everyday use. Here it is:

48.4.1  Values of Roughness
The roughness e of a pipe does not depend on the nature of the fluid 
being conveyed through the pipe. Once the e value for a given length 
of pipe is known, then the same value is used whatever liquid or gas 
is in the pipeline, as long as there is no further corrosion or damage to 
the inside of the pipeline.
Most often we have to assume a value for pipe roughness e by 
using standard values from tables. Here are some examples:
 
Roughness e, ft
Drawn tubing
0.000005
Commercial steel and wrought iron
0.00015
Asphalted cast iron
0.0004
Galvanized iron
0.0005
Cast iron
0.00085
Wood stave
0.0006–0.003
Concrete
0.001–0.01
Riveted steel
0.003–0.03
But if you are able to pump water through the pipeline, at a veloc-
ity sufficiently high to give rise to turbulent flow (Re > ca 2500, but 
the higher the better), then the pipe roughness e can be found by cal-
culating the Reynolds number and measuring the frictional pressure 
drop or frictional head loss along the pipe. Then using the friction 
factor φ and Reynolds number Re you can find the roughness e via the 
relative roughness term e/ID from the friction factor chart as illus-
trated in Fig. 48.6. 
For example: There is a 10-inch steel pipeline that is used to deliver 
various liquid products from a production facility to a dock. The line is 
flushed with water when switching products. There have been ques-
tions as to whether some older sections of this line need to be replaced 
because of increased internal roughness. The first part of the line is the 
oldest part and runs up over a hill and in an area overgrown with 
bushes and thorns, quite difficult to inspect. We check the installation 
drawings to find the length of the line between the two closest pressure 
points, and find the elevations of the pressure points from a large-scale 
contour map of the area. We measure the flow rate with water in the line 
by monitoring the change in the level of water in the supply tank; this 
may require a very large tank for high flow rates.

Referring to Fig. 48.6, we find e/ID = 0.0003.
The roughness, e = 0.0003 × 0.833 ≡ 0.00025 ft, or if we look on a 
more detailed chart,4 this value for e/ID may be found to be close to 
0.0004 to give e as 0.00033, which still compares with values quoted 
for steel pipe, but the internal surface is becoming rough, as a result 
of corrosion erosion or adhering deposits. However, please note that 
this approach is an approximation. Generally the effects of aging are 
not likely to be uniform along the whole pipeline, so that e/ID may 
vary along the length of the pipe. Particularly, one might expect a 
degree of pitting and build up of local corrosion and other debris 
inside the pipeline at a number of critical points such as bend, fit-
tings, and so forth.
48.5  Special Case for Laminar Flow
You will have noticed that there is just one line on the friction factor 
chart (Fig. 48.6) for  in terms of Re in the laminar flow region (Re less 
than 2 × 103) of slope  = 8/Re. This means that for Reynolds numbers 
of less than 2000 we can very simply calculate the frictional pressure 
loss by the relationship

smooth pipes at Reynolds numbers between 2.5 × 103 and 1 × 105. In

The friction factor  becomes independent of the Reynolds number 
and tends toward a constant value depending only on the value of 
the relative roughness (e/ID) see Fig. 48.6.
Suppose e/ID is 0.05, then for values of Re above 1 × 105 the fric-

48.8  Non-newtonian Fluids
We have defined a Newtonian fluid as one that has a constant viscos-
ity at a given temperature and pressure irrespective of the way in 
which it is flowing or being moved. We can also say that the ratio of 
shear stress to shear rate in such a fluid would have a constant value at 
constant temperature and pressure. Effectively, all gases approximate 
to this Newtonian type of flow behavior and most low-viscosity liquids 
are also Newtonian. That a fluid is either compressible (like a gas)  

	
640	
C h a p t e r  F o r t y - E i g h t
or incompressible (like water) has no significance in deciding whether 
it is Newtonian or non-newtonian in flow behavior.
Non-newtonian fluids show a different apparent viscosity 
depending on the shear to which they are exposed—that is, depend-
ing on the way in which they are flowing or being moved. Apparent 
viscosity for some fluids varies with the magnitude of the shear, and 
for others it depends also on how long they experience shear. Usually 
non-newtonian flow arises in fluids with complex molecular struc-
tures (e.g., polymers) and some hydrocarbon crude oils, and where 
large groups of particles are loosely held together such as in floccu-
lated slurries or suspensions of solids in liquids; pastes and emulsions 
also usually fall into this category.
To decide whether a fluid is Newtonian or non-newtonian, we 
need to know how it behaves in response to shear.
Suppose I now explain that the Newtonian kind of flow behavior is 
really just a special case, just a way that some fluids behave over a par-
ticular range of shear rates. You can see it has been suggested that at 
high enough shear rate, all liquids become non-newtonian.5 It is just 
that the liquids we have been considering earlier in this chapter and 
elsewhere in this book only become non-newtonian at very high rates 
of shear. For example, the critical shear rate for glycerol and mineral oils 
above which they cease to behave as Newtonian liquids would be 
above about 1 × 105 s-1. It has also been estimated that pentane becomes 
non-newtonian above shear rates of 5 × 106 s-1, and it has even been 
suggested that water would start to show non-newtonian behavior5 at 
the impossibly high shear rate of 1012 s-1. So what kind of flow behavior 
can we expect from the fluids around us? Some fluids may even appear 
at first glance to be more like solids than liquids and not seem really 
capable of “flow” in the ordinary sense at all. Fortunately a number of 
very dedicated people have also been asking this same question for 
many years, and there is now a wealth of experimental information, 
mathematical modeling, and excellent texts to help us come to terms 
with this situation.4–6 But while we are discussing some of the simplest 
forms of non-newtonian behavior, please be aware that most fluids will 
exhibit more than one type of non-newtonian behavior. In these cir-
cumstances we usually select the most dominant characteristics to pre-
dict the flow behavior.
48.9  Some Types of Flow Behavior
Take a look at Fig. 48.7. This should give you an idea of some of the 
variations of fluid flow behavior. The gradients or slopes of these 
lines or curves are variable within the identified flow regime. It is 
whether or not the curves pass through “the origin” and the general 
shape of the curve that defines the type of behavior.

The diagram shown in Fig. 48.8 is also included to guide you as 
we take a little closer, qualitative look at some of these types of non-
newtonian flows (for more detailed information we suggest you 
begin with the references 4, 5, and 6 at the end of this chapter).
48.9.1  Time-Independent Flow
As the name suggests, this type of flow behavior is not affected by the 
length of time that the fluid has been flowing or being moved. We say 
it is unaffected by the duration of the shear which it experiences. This 
type of flow is the best documented, and some simple models of pre-
dicting flow exist to which we will later refer.
In this group we have Newtonian flow with which we are familiar, 
shear-thinning, shear-thickening, and viscoplastic flow. Please note 
once again that these non-newtonian types of flow may be exhibited 
by fluids that will indeed also behave as Newtonian liquids over a 
particular range of shear rates.
Shear-thinning liquids in general become more fluid, less viscous, 
as the shear rate on them increases. Typical examples of such fluids 
are: shower gel, hair conditioner, fabric conditioner, liquid abrasive 
cleaner, fabric washing liquid, printing ink, facial wash, flocculated 

	
642	
C h a p t e r  F o r t y - E i g h t
clay slurries, 1 percent aqueous solutions of food thickeners (such as 
guar gum, locust bean gum, carrageenan, xanthan gum, alginate), 
most paints, many 1 to 2 percent aqueous polymer solutions, and 
some hydrocarbon crude oils. 
In particular, with fluids such as flocculated clay slurries, which 
may have very high apparent viscosity at low shear rates, the fact that 
they are shear thinning enables us to pump them and convey them 
relatively easily by pipeline because of the high rates of shear applied 
by the fast spinning impeller of a centrifugal pump and the shear that 
they experience at the pipe wall (and another phenomena known as 
wall slip that also reduces the viscosity at the pipe wall).
Shear-thickening liquids are liquids whose apparent viscosity 
increases with increased shear rate. The old name for this is “dila-
tant” because the fluid appears to swell as it is sheared. The best way 
I can describe this is to ask you to think of a bucket of sand and water 
with about an inch of water above the settled sand. (Think back to 
your childhood visits to the seaside or sand pit.) Suppose you now 
rock the bucket from side to side; the sand and water mix together to 
form a rather unstable suspension. However, if you take a stick and 
try to stir the contents of the bucket with any appreciable amount of 
force it is virtually impossible. The suspension actually begins to look 
like a fractured solid. This is an extreme example of shear thickening. 
The voidage between the sand particles and the amount of water pre-
sent when the mixture behaves like a suspension is just enough to

allow the mixture to flow at very low shear rates and let the particles 
move past each other. At high shear rates, the mixture expands, there 
is not enough water to fill the voids, so the particles of sand rub 
against each other, dramatically increasing the apparent viscosity as 
the shear rate increases. Other materials that exhibit this type of 
behavior are concentrated (especially deflocculated) aqueous sus-
pensions of china clay, titanium oxide, corn flour, and wet cement 
aggregates.
Viscoplastic fluids are those that appear to show a “yield stress.” That 
is, a certain amount of shear stress must be applied to the material 
before it can begin to flow, or deform. Whereas in fact it seems that if 
flow is measured over a wide enough range of shear rates, no yield 
stress really does exist,5 the concept of a yield stress remains very con-
venient, because a number of materials do closely approximate to this 
type of behavior.
If the material is being sheared but at less than the yield shear 
stress (Ryield), then the material will deform “elastically” and flow as a 
rigid body and not like a fluid. The classic example of this type of 
behavior is the behavior of toothpaste, which flows “en masse” 
through the nozzle of the container tube when the tube is squeezed 
(shear at the nozzle wall being much higher than in the bulk of the 
paste), but stays firmly rod shaped on the toothbrush until at some 
higher shear rate it deforms when brushed onto one’s teeth. Actually, 
this is an example of a Bingham plastic, which, once the shear stress 
exceeds the yield stress for a limited range of shear rates, will then flow 
with shear stress directly proportioned to shear rate. To be more precise, 
we should really say that such fluids flow with any further shear stress 
(R), over and above the yield stress, in a way that is directly propor-
tioned to shear rate. This is somewhat similar to Newtonian behavior 
except that the yield shear stress (Ryield) must be reached before there 
can be any flow. After that yield stress has been reached and over a lim-
ited range of shear rate (), we have:
[(R - Ryield) / ] = constant
We also find fluids that appear to have a yield stress but once 
that is reached will then show shear-thinning flow behavior, and 
these we call yield pseudoplastic. These fluids are also sometimes 
known as Herschel-Bulkley fluids and for these we can write:
[(R - Ryield) /  n] = constant
This covers a wider range of fluids than that of the Bingham plas-
tic and so there are numerous examples of these yield pseudoplastic 
materials quoted in texts, including: mayonnaise, ketchup, some 
printing inks, molten chocolate, plastic explosives, blood, water-coal 
mixtures,5 foams, battery and rocket propellant pastes, and drilling 
muds.

48.9.2  Time-Dependent Flow
These are fluids whose apparent viscosity changes according to the 
length of time that they are exposed to shear, as well as in accordance with 
the rate of shear. We also note that if a fluid of this type has already been 
exposed to shear, by pumping or mixing, and so on, it is likely to have a 
different apparent viscosity, or rather, “effective viscosity,” than that of 
the virgin unsheared material. Finally, just to complete the picture, if a 
material of this type is exposed to shear (e.g., pumping or mixing) and 
then allowed to stand or “relax” in a tank, for example, then to some 
extent and once again depending on how long the material has rested 
since being sheared, its effective viscosity will be restored to some 
degree, and in some cases, close to that of the virgin material. The 
past treatment of the material with reference to the degree of shear 
experienced and time of relaxation, and so forth, is known as the kine-
matic history of the fluid.
Thixotropic fluids are time-dependent shear thinning in nature 
although for any given shear rate as shearing continues, an equilib-
rium will eventually be established and the viscosity will reach a con-
stant value. The explanation for this is that the microstructure of the 
material breaks down with shear, and to some extent, is able to 
rebuild when the material is left to stand. The best example of a thix-
otropic material is nondrip (thixotropic) house paint. It looks almost 
gelatinous or even semisolid in the paint can, but flows like a liquid 
when stirred rapidly. It stays on the brush between paint can and 
house wall (while there is no shear), and then flows over the wall 
surface when sheared by the action of the brush strokes.
Rheopectic fluids are sometimes said to behave with negative thixo­
tropy, meaning that they are time dependent as is the case with thixo-
tropic fluids, but are instead shear thickening in nature. This type of 
behavior has been documented5 for a 42 percent aqueous gypsum 
paste, which when shaken and then rested for 40 min resolidified. But 
this occurred in just 20 s if the paste was only gently sheared (i.e., the 
container was rolled gently between the palms of the hands).
Once again, please bear in mind that it is not unusual for a mate-
rial to exhibit both thixotropy and rheopexy depending on the shear 
rate and concentration of solids.
48.10  Viscoelastic Fluids
These are fluids that have the ability to store and recover shear energy 
and, hence, show some properties of a solid and some properties of a 
liquid. There are two easily observable examples of viscoelastic 
behavior:
•	 The soup bowl effect: Suppose we gently stir a bowl of soup with 
a spoon so that the soup revolves around the bowl. If the spoon 
is lifted out of the soup (i.e., the energy source is removed), the 

	
F l u i d  F l o w  i n  P i p e s 	
645
soup will gradually come to rest (the inertial circulation dies 
out due to the effects of viscous forces), and then if the soup is 
viscoelastic (as many canned soups are), it may seem to rotate 
in the opposite direction or “unwind” a little.
•	 Die swell: The jet formed by a viscoelastic fluid emerging from 
a nozzle or die may be of larger diameter than the aperture 
through which it flows. This is due to the removal of a con-
straining force on the fluid.
Other examples of viscoelastic materials are synovial fluid, molten 
polymers (with thread-forming properties used in fiber spinning or 
film blowing), and “bouncing putty” or “nutty putty,” which will flow 
if stretched slowly, but bounces if struck hard against a hard surface.
48.11  Identifying the Type of Flow Behavior
Depending on the kind of process you work with, you may have 
facilities on hand to check the rheology (flowing characteristics) of 
the fluids involved in your work. If so, you can plot the shear stress 
against shear rate over your working range of shear rates to see 
which type of flow behavior you have as compared to those shown 
in Fig. 48.7. There are many different kinds of instruments (viscom-
eters) to measure these properties. Further discussion of these may be 
found in references 4, 5, and 6 at the end of this chapter.
Otherwise, bear in mind that very often the range of shear rates to 
which a process fluid is exposed in pipe flow is often quite limited, and 
because of this it is often possible to adequately represent the flow behav-
ior of a process fluid over a limited range of shear rates by the power law 
or Ostwald de Waele model, and the Metzner-Reed Reynolds number,7 
which we shall shortly discuss. Meanwhile, in the absence of any lab 
equipment to provide you with shear-stress versus shear-rate data, we 
suggest that you vary the flow rate to provide several flow rates, and run 
pressure drop surveys over the pipeline in question. Tabulate the data 
and use this to develop a “power law” relationship (see following sec-
tions) as a first approximation for your pipeline and process fluid. Most 
likely you will not need to perform any more elaborate study than that.
48.12  Apparent and Effective Viscosity 
of Non-Newtonian Liquids
We have said that for a Newtonian fluid the viscosity can be expressed 
as shear stress divided by shear rate:
	
µ = γ
R
	
which is a constant for constant temperature and pressure.

	
646	
C h a p t e r  F o r t y - E i g h t
When we consider non-newtonian liquids, the viscosity is not 
constant, because of the influence of shear rate and time. So for non-
newtonian fluids we refer to their apparent viscosity (a), or effective 
viscosity, and we have to specify the conditions of shear rate to which 
this applies. When we speak of time-dependent fluids, we must also 
specify the shear history or kinematic history, at the point that their appar-
ent viscosity is quoted. As long as we keep these restrictions in mind for 
a non-newtonian fluid, we can still think of the apparent viscosity as:
	
µ = γ
R
a
	
That is, the apparent viscosity of a non-newtonian liquid can be 
expressed as the ratio of shear stress to shear rate at a specific point 
within the fluid, and perhaps even at a specific point in time, or within 
a specific shear-rate range, depending on the nature of the liquid.
Effective viscosity is a term used to relate non-newtonian behav-
ior to that of some hypothetical equivalent Newtonian fluid, just as is 
apparent viscosity. However, the term effective viscosity really relates 
more to the behavior of the bulk of the fluid and is, as a concept, equal 
to the Newtonian viscosity that would give the same relationship.6
The units of measurements of apparent viscosity or effective vis-
cosity are the same as those used for viscosity when we refer to a 
Newtonian fluid. We have mainly used lb/ft s, which is the unit of 
viscosity in the fps system.
48.13  The Power Law or Ostwald de Waele Model
This was conceived as a means of predicting the flow behavior 
of time-independent fluids, particularly shear-thinning and shear-
thickening fluids. It is really nothing more than an equation to fit the 
plot of shear stress versus shear rate for such a fluid when both are 
plotted on logarithmic scaled paper.
The basic form of this is
R = k ()n
from which the apparent viscosity, at any given point within the fluid

becomes
( )
a

n
	
where k is known as the consistency coefficient
	          n is the power law index
Both k and n must be experimentally derived for each fluid that one 
is working with over the appropriate (operable) range of shear rates. In 
pipe flow this translates to running a series of different flow rates 
through the same pipe system as will carry the fluid and measuring 

	
F l u i d  F l o w  i n  P i p e s 	
647
pressure drop for each flow rate in order to derive k and n, as we shall 
see later. It is also possible to measure k and n by plotting shear stress 
versus shear rate using data from laboratory viscometer measurements 
on the fluid with which you are working.
In general if:
•	 n is less than 1, the fluid shows shear thinning.
•	 n equals 1, the fluid behaves as Newtonian.
•	 n is more than 1, the fluid shows shear thickening.
The smaller the value of n, the more shear thinning the liquid will 
be. The opposite is true for a shear-thickening liquid.
The whole idea is that for these types of fluids some portion of 
their shear-stress versus shear-rate plot on log scales would tend to 
be a straight line. (Just as Newtonian behavior where n = 1 would 
provide a straight line for such a plot whether plotted on log scales or 
ordinary graph paper.) The fact that such plots on log scales (where n 
is not equal to 1) are straight lines only over some portion of the 
shear-rate range is the reason why it is necessary to stringently limit 
the range of shear rates over which you apply the equation to match 
those for which the values of n and k were determined. Do not extrap-
olate beyond known experimental data for the liquid with which you are 
working.
Please note that values of k cannot be compared for fluids with 
different n values. This is because the value and units of the consist-
ency index k depend upon the value of the power law index n. (In fact 
k actually has dimensions ML-1 Tn-2, whereas n is dimensionless.)
The areas where this model (equation) will be the most unreliable 
are at very low and very high rates of shear. It has been suggested5 
that this model is typically at its most reliable over shear-rate ranges 
between 101 and 103 s-1.
The values of k and n may not always be the same across the 
whole range, depending on the fluid. However, it is possible to 
deal with this and sometimes even larger ranges of shear rates by 
breaking the range into smaller sections. Then deal with the whole 
range section by section using appropriate values of k and n.
In general, even with its limitations, the power law model is 
usually the first choice for engineering calculations because it is 
simple, and when used with care, over a narrow or medium 
range of shear rates, it provides adequate and quite reasonable 
predictions.
48.13.1  Evaluating k and n
The classical way to evaluate k and n for a power law fluid is by using 
log10 scales to plot the shear stress (in fps units, that is, poundal/ft2 or lb 
(mass)/ft s2 on the vertical axis, versus nominal shear rate (s-1) on the 

	
648

horizontal axis. (See Fig. 48.9.) Using the same symbols and units as in 
earlier sections, this is:

If all the points you plot fall close to a single straight line, you are 
assured that the fluid fits the power law over the range of shear rates 
that you are using.
The power law index n can then be found from the slope of the 
line (see Fig. 48.9) and k is found for fluids in laminar flow via k as 
follows,7 using the value obtained for n.
	
k = [(ID × P)/4l]/[(8V)/ID]n

please refer to references 4, 5, and 6 for details of these.
Alternatively, over very small ranges of flow rate you could try 
using two pairs of flow-rate and pressure-drop measurements (one 
pair at each end of your flow-rate range), and use the following rela-
tionship with both pairs of measurements in succession, to find k and 
n directly, for fluids in laminar flow.
	
V = [(P)/(4kl)]1/n × [n/(6n + 2)] × [ID] (n + 1)/n	
48.14  Generalized Reynolds Numbers

newtonian fluids as has been developed for Newtonian fluids, gener-
alized Reynolds numbers of the following form have been developed.

The Metzner-Reed Reynolds number7 is the generalized Reynolds

comparison with other texts and charts easier for you, I will write it 
out in its usual form; please bear with me, it really is not complicated.

n = n and k = k [(3n + 1) /4n] n
By the way, this also provides us with another expression for 
apparent viscosity or effective viscosity, as follows:
effective = k [ (8V) /ID]n-1
48.14.2  Friction Factor and ReMR

same commodity for non-newtonian power law fluids:
	
φ =

We also have the Fanning friction factor, f, which equals 2; and 
the Moody friction factor f´, which equals 8, just as we saw earlier 
when discussing frictional pressure loss in rough and smooth pipe 
for Newtonian fluids.

	
650

The Metzner-Reed Reynolds number can also be used in con-
junction with the familiar expressions for frictional pressure loss

In laminar flow for power law fluids in smooth or rough pipes, we 
can still use4 the familiar:
 = 8/ReMR
The standard friction factor chart (Fig. 48.6) can also be used with 
ReMR. Please note that two liquids having similar k and n values in 
laminar flow may not necessarily behave similarly to one another in 
turbulent flow, as would be the case if you compared a flocculated 
clay suspension with a polymer solution.
In turbulent flow for smooth pipes we can use an expression 
derived from the Blasius equation:
	
φ =

where n is the power law index.
This expression gives the friction factor to within plus or minus 
10 percent accuracy. Other relationships do exist,6 but they are more 
complex and do not provide very much greater accuracy. However, 
even to predict DP under turbulent conditions one needs to have 
evaluated k and n from laminar flow data at the same wall shear 
stress as that expected in the actual pipe flow operating under turbu-
lent conditions.6
In general, non-newtonian flow behavior (or rheology) is of dom-
inant importance in laminar flow because it influences viscous shear. 
The transition from laminar to turbulent flow is much less sharply 
defined for non-newtonian fluids than it is for Newtonian, and it is 
difficult to predict with any degree of accuracy. However, a value of 
the Metzner-Reed Reynolds number (ReMR) of 2000 is still a reasonable 
estimate for the transition from laminar to turbulent flow.
When turbulence takes over, the non-newtonian rheology plays a 
much less important role in determining how the liquid will flow. In fact, 
there is not likely to be too much error by treating shear-thinning fluids 

	
F l u i d  F l o w  i n  P i p e s 	
651
in turbulent flow as if they were Newtonian. Therefore, the turbulent 
flow of a shear-thinning fluid can be reasonably approximated using 
ReMR and the friction factor chart shown in Fig. 48.6.
There is also a friction factor chart drawn by Dodge and Metzner8 
plotting the Fanning friction factor versus the Metzner-Reed Reynolds 
number (although this has been subsequently redrawn for conveni-
ence with , see ref. 4). This chart shows that the friction factor decreases 
with n in turbulent flow—that is, it decreases as shear-thinning charac-
ter increases. If you are studying this chart, be aware that the only 
experimentally verified data for turbulent flow is that given for n = 1.0 
to n = 0.4.
The material presented in this chapter has been used by the 
author to study and predict the flow behavior of water and solid-
liquid suspensions in a 10-mi-long pipeline between a processing 
plant and dock facility. I would tell you about it now, but that’s 
another story, and this chapter is long enough already!
If you are trying to predict non-newtonian flow behavior, this 
chapter should give you a place to start. The references may also be 
useful and they will in turn provide you with many more references, 
historic and recent. This is a developing field.5,6 At present, there is 
increasing demand to predict how slurries, emulsions, gels, pastes 
polymers, heavy oils, and so on, will flow and how they will behave 
if left to stand over long periods.
Therefore, if you are trying to do more precise work with non-
newtonian fluids I would advise you to try as many of the correla-
tions as you can find in the literature7–9 that are relevant to the fluid 
and conditions that you are working with, and then compare the 
results!

engineering. Yet I have never seen this idea discussed in any 
text concerning distillation.
The effect is observed in two areas of a distillation operation:
• Partial condensation
• Once-through thermosyphon and kettle reboilers
The concept of a super-fractionation tray is important when sepa-
rating products, if either the top or bottom product consists of a multi-
component mixture. For example, if we are fractionating only a mixture 
of propane and isobutane, the super-fractionation concept would not 
be significant. However, if the overhead product consisted of a mix-
ture of ethane, propane, and isobutane (i.e., C2s, C3s, and C4s) and the 
overhead condenser was a partial condenser (see Fig. 49.1), then the 
partial condenser would serve as a super-fractionation stage. The par-
tial conden­ser would contribute far more to fractionation than any of 
the other stages in the upper portion of the distillation tower.
If the bottom product consisted of a mixture of isopentane, nor-
mal hexane, and normal heptane (i.e., C5s, C6s, and C7s) and the 
reboiler was a kettle-type reboiler (see Fig. 49.2), then the kettle 
reboiler would serve as a super-fractionation stage. The kettle reboiler 
would contribute far more to fractionation than any of the other 
stages in the lower portion of the distillation tower.
49.1  My First Encounter with Super-Fractionation
In 1969, I was working for Amoco Oil as a process design engineer. One 
of my earliest designs for Amoco was a gasoline debutanizer, the bot-
tom portion of which is shown in Fig. 49.3. Note that this tower is

equipped with a once-through thermosyphon reboiler. Such a reboiler 
works as the bottom theoretical stage of the debutanizer assuming that:
	
1.	 All of the liquid from the bottom tray flows to the reboiler.
	
2.	 Valve A is closed.
But valve A was not closed. I had opened the valve myself during 
the initial tower start-up. Opening valve A is a necessary part of the 
tower start-up procedure. This allows liquid to gravitate out of the bot-
tom of the tower and into the reboiler, the objective being to establish

thermosyphon circulation until a vapor flow is established through 
tray deck 1. However, when I tried to close valve A, the reboiler duty 
died off, indicating a loss of flow into the shell side of the reboiler. So, 
I was forced to leave the start-up line (i.e., valve A shown in Fig. 49.3) 
open to sustain the reboiler duty.
The reboiler now seemed to work fine. The problem was that the 
debutanizer tower was not doing a good job of debutanizing. The 
butane content of the gasoline bottoms product was 4 percent. My 
design for the tower was based on 1 percent butane in gasoline. Some-
thing was terribly wrong.
I rechecked my computer model for the tower. With an assumed 
80 percent tray efficiency, which is normal for this service at the 
observed reflux ratio, a 1 percent butane in the gasoline would be 
expected. To force my computer model to match the observed 4 percent

butane in the gasoline, I had to assume a low 40 percent tray efficiency 
for the bottom eight trays. I concluded something was wrong with 
these trays.
My boss organized a meeting with the plant manager. I reported 
that the bottom eight trays must have been damaged on start-up as 
indicated by their low tray efficiency of 40 percent, as compared to 
their design tray efficiency of 80 percent.
The plant manager was doubtful. Perhaps, he asked, this could be 
an installation error? Perhaps, he wondered, the trays had not been 
installed properly?
“No, that’s not possible,” I replied, as I had personally inspected  
the installed trays and approved the tower as ready for closure. No, 
the trays were designed and installed properly. They must have 
been damaged on start-up. I advised that we should now order new 
replacement trays. We should shut down the debutanizer as soon as 
the replacement trays arrived.
When the new trays were delivered, the debutanizer was taken 
offline, steamed out, and opened. When I entered the tower, I discov-
ered that each and every tray in the column was totally and completely 
intact and clean. Everything was just as I had last seen it six months 
ago. Actually, the only thing that had changed was me. I had become 
smarter in the last six months. For example, I now noticed that the 
sides of the draw pan (see Fig. 49.3) were missing. True, they had been 
missing last year too, but I had not noticed their absence then.
This explained why I had been forced to open valve A (the start-up 
line) to get flow to the reboiler. That is, the liquid from the bottom tray 
seal pan was largely overflowing the draw pan and bypassing the 
reboiler. Hence, the only way I could get enough liquid into the reboiler 
was to gravitate it out of the bottom of the tower through valve A.
But could this explain the poor fractionation efficiency in the 
bottom of the debutanizer? How could opening valve A reduce the 
apparent tray efficiency of the bottom eight trays from 80 percent to 
40 percent?
The temperatures shown in Fig. 49.3 are design temperatures:
• Tray eight temperature = 200°F
• Bottom tray temperature = 300°F
• Reboiler outlet temperature = 400°F
• Tower bottom temperature = 400°F
The tower bottom and reboiler outlet temperatures are both 
400°F. This is because all the liquid from tray 1 is supposed to be 
drawn off to the reboiler. The only liquid in the bottom of the tower is 
the liquid portion of the reboiler effluent.
But if valve A is opened, and the feed to the reboiler is coming 
from the bottom of the tower, then the reboiler outlet temperature 

	
S u p e r - F r a c t i o n a t i o n  S e p a r a t i o n  S t a g e 	
657
must be hotter than the tower bottoms temperature. This tempera-
ture difference would be quite small if we had essentially a pure com-
ponent (like butane) as the tower bottoms product. But with a wide 
boiling range mixture (like gasoline) as the tower bottoms product, 
the reboiler outlet temperature would become much hotter than the 
tower bottom temperature.
As the amount of liquid overflowing the draw pan increases, 
and the amount of liquid flowing to the reboiler decreases, the tower 
bottoms temperature will start to approach the tray temperature. 
For example, with valve A wide open, I had observed the following 
temperatures:
Observed

Tray 1
300°F
300°F
Tower bottom
320°F
400°F
Reboiler 
outlet
400°F
400°F
These temperatures indicated that most of the bottoms gasoline 
product was coming from the bottom tray of the tower, rather than 
from the reboiler effluent. Or the once-through thermosyphon reboiler 
was no longer functioning as the bottom theoretical fractionation 
stage of my debutanizer.
But so what? So what if I had lost one fractionation stage? I still 
had eight other trays between the reboiler and the tower feed. So 
what if I had lost one stage out of nine?
Unfortunately, not all stages are equal. The once-through thermosy-
phon reboiler functions as a super-fractionation stage. It provides not 
one-ninth but one-half of the fractionation in the bottom portion of the 
debutanizer. After all, half of the temperature increase (see Fig. 49.3) 
between the 200°F tray-8 temperature and the 400°F tower bottoms 
product temperature occurs across the reboiler, provided that all the 
liquid from tray 1 flows to the reboiler. The reason the reboiler tem-
perature rise is 100°F is because heat is added to the reboiler. Adding 
heat to a fractionation stage located below the feed point makes that 
stage into a super-fractionation stage. If the bottoms product bypasses 
this super-fractionation reboiler stage, then a large percentage of the 
tower’s potential fractionation capacity is lost.
49.1.1  The Chickens Come Home to Roost
Looking at my computer model of the debutanizer confirmed my 
worst fears. The butane content of the debutanizer gasoline was 
4 percent from the second theoretical stage and 1 percent from the 
first theoretical stage. Of course, the second theoretical stage of our 
computer model is tray 1, and the first theoretical stage is the reboiler. 

	
658	
C h a p t e r  F o r t y - N i n e
If the sides of the draw-off pan have been left off, then the colder, 
lighter liquid from tray 1 will bypass the reboiler. This reboiler is 
doing half of the fractionation work, hence, the overall efficiency of 
the lower half of the debutanizer falls by one-half. The apparent over-
all tray efficiency drops from 80 to 40 percent.
My boss generously gave me the opportunity to explain all this to 
the plant manager. I explained that we had extended the height of the 
sides of the draw pan by 18 inches. The debutanizer was now back 
on-line. Gasoline was on specification with 1 percent butane.
“And the new trays?” asked the plant manager. “Were they 
installed?”
“Not exactly. The new trays have been carefully placed as spares 
in the refinery warehouse storage,” I replied. “They will provide a 
useful hedge against any future cost inflation in replacement tray 
charges. They are carried in our accounts as a passive asset.”
For years thereafter, the plant manager consistently referred to 
my anti-inflationary foresight as gross stupidity. His narrow-minded, 
hostile, and totally unfair comments being based on my supposed 
negligence in not observing that the sides of the draw pan were miss-
ing before the initial start-up in 1969.
49.2  Kettle Reboiler
I could tell almost the same story about the kettle reboiler shown in 
Fig. 49.2. In this case, we were trying to strip ethane out of a mixture 
of propane, butane, and gasoline at the Good Hope Refinery in Norco, 
Louisiana. Valve B had been left open because of fouling and high-
pressure drop on the shell side of the kettle reboiler. The kettle reboiler 
also, like the once-through thermosyphon reboiler discussed above, 
functions as the bottom theoretical stage of the de-ethanizer. It’s a 
super-fractionation stage because heat is added to the stage. Opening 
valve B permitted the bottoms product to bypass this super-fractionation 
stage. We didn’t even open the tower. I just had the shell side of the 
kettle cleaned. We could then run with valve B closed and fractiona-
tion efficiency was restored to normal.
49.3  Partial Condenser
Figure 49.4 shows the overhead system of the Coastal Refinery crude 
distillation tower in Aruba. The island of Aruba is a beautiful country in 
the Caribbean Sea off the coast of Venezuela. I often take my wife, Liz, 
on a romantic vacation to this tropical paradise. During one such exotic 
trip I was assigned by Coastal to find a plan to improve fractionation 
between naphtha and jet fuel. The problem was that the naphtha con-
tained 20 percent jet fuel. A computer simulation of the crude tower 
indicated that the apparent tray efficiency of the upper five trays was 

	
S u p e r - F r a c t i o n a t i o n  S e p a r a t i o n  S t a g e 	
659
only 30 percent. However, fractionation between naphtha and jet fuel 
occurs in two regions of the tower shown in Fig. 49.4:
• Trays 16 through 20
• The hot drum, where the reflux liquid is separated from the naph-
tha vapor product
To discriminate between the fractionation efficiency of the 
trays and the hot drum, I obtained a sample of reflux from the 
discharge of the hot drum reflux pump. It contained 25 percent jet 
fuel and 75 percent naphtha. I compared the analysis of this sample 
to my computer simulation. The degree of fractionation observed 
between jet fuel and the reflux indicated a tray efficiency for trays 
16 through 20 of 65 percent. This is a normal tray efficiency for this 
service.
The partial condenser and the hot drum shown in Fig. 49.4 serve 
as the top theoretical separation stage of this tower. The computer 
simulation showed that the amount of jet fuel in the reflux should be 
25 percent, and the amount of jet fuel in the naphtha product should 
be 8 percent.
The samples showed that the amount of jet fuel in the reflux was 
25 percent, and the amount of jet fuel in the naphtha product was 
20 percent. The reason for the high jet fuel content of the naphtha 
was, I found, that valve C shown in Fig. 49.4 was open halfway. The 
operators had left valve C open to prevent a high liquid level in the

hot drum. In effect, this ruined the separation efficiency of the top 
theoretical stage of the tower.
But why would ruining the separation efficiency of one theoretical 
separation stage degrade the apparent tray efficiency of trays 16 through 
20 from 65 to 30 percent? Well, because the top theoretical separation 
stage represented by the partial condenser is a super-fractionation stage. 
Heat is removed from that stage. The heat I’m talking about is the duty 
of the air cooler upstream of the hot drum.
Any time heat is removed from a fractionation stage above a tow-
er’s feed point, that stage becomes a super-fractionation stage. To 
prove my point, note the temperatures shown in Fig. 49.4:
• The DT between the jet fuel product draw-off (380°F) and the 
tower top temperature (300°F) is 80°F.
• The DT between the tower top temperature (300°F) and the 
hot drum temperature (215°F) is 85°F.
For wide boiling range mixtures, such as naphtha and kerosene, 
the temperature difference across portions of a distillation tower 
approximately corresponds to the degree of fractionation achieved. 
The DTs indicate that the amount of fractionation work done across 
the top five trays is about the same amount of fractionation work 
done in the top theoretical separation stage, which is represented by 
the partial condenser. The partial condenser consists of the air cooler 
and the hot drum, shown in Fig. 49.4.
49.3.1  Another Defect
I blocked valve C shown in Fig. 49.4, waited a few minutes, and 
obtained a sample of product naphtha from the hot drum. Lab analy-
sis showed that the amount of jet fuel in the naphtha product had 
dropped from 20 to 10 percent. Another victory to report to the plant 
manager of the Coastal Refinery in Aruba.
Next day, I scheduled a meeting with the plant manager to 
report on my success. But the plant manager had a different view. 
His narrow-minded, hostile, and unfair comments were quite 
offensive.
“Lieberman, I had a check sample run on our naphtha product. 
We now have 21 percent jet fuel in the naphtha, not 10 percent. You’ve 
made fractionation worse, not better.”
I rushed out to the unit, suspecting that the operators had re-
opened valve C (see Fig. 49.4). But it was still shut. What now? Maybe 
it was best just to accept defeat. But then I looked up at the hot drum, 
which was located just above valve C. It seemed as if the level shown 
in the gauge glass was 6 to 10 inches higher than it had been yester-
day. I then noticed that there was something odd about the design of 
the hot drum.

	
S u p e r - F r a c t i o n a t i o n  S e p a r a t i o n  S t a g e 	
661
Referring to Fig. 49.5, note that the vapor outlet nozzle is not on the 
top of the drum, but on the side. And the liquid level in this drum 
exactly coincided with the bottom of the vapor outlet nozzle. I sud-
denly recalled a comment that the panel board operator made yesterday 
when valve C was closed.
“Señor Lieberman, have you noticed that the hot drum level has 
increased from 61 to 69 percent?”
I didn’t pay much attention to the comment because the liquid 
level stabilized at 69 percent. But 69 percent coincided with the bot-
tom of the vapor outlet nozzle. The reflux that had been flowing 
through valve C into the cold drum was now overflowing into the 
cold drum through the vapor outlet nozzle.
Overflowing reflux from the hot drum into the cold drum 
destroyed the efficiency of the super-fractionation stage represented 
by the partial condenser. To restore this lost fractionation, I had the 
panel board operator lower the reflux drum level to 60 percent by 
increasing the tower top reflux rate. This time I waited a few hours 
before pulling my naphtha product sample. Analysis then showed 
there was now only 7 percent jet fuel in the naphtha product. Finally, 
real victory!
Unfortunately, Liz unfairly characterizes this visit to the 
Coastal Refinery in Aruba as just another business trip. She refuses

to acknowledge that she had been taken to an exotic island para-
dise for a honeymoon vacation. She has persisted in this narrow-
minded view, dis­re­garding the hundred or so trips we have made 
to the Aruba Refinery, all of which have been, in part, romantic 
adventures.
49.4  Side Reboilers and Intercoolers
Side or outrigger reboilers are sometimes used to supplement the 
capacity of the bottom’s reboiler. Intercoolers or side slip-stream cool-
ers are sometimes used to supplement the capacity of the overhead 
condenser.
Side reboilers and intercoolers also function as super-fractionation 
separation stages. They are just a subcase of once-through thermosy-
phon reboilers and partial overhead condensers.

Hand Calculations 
for Distillation 
Towers
Vapor-Liquid Equilibrium, Absorption, 
and Stripping Calculations
50.1  Introduction
The top of a distillation tower works like an absorber whereas the bot-
tom of a distillation tower works like a stripper. The upper and lower 
parts of a tower are the rectification section, which is the upper portion 
above the feed inlet, and the stripping section, which is the lower portion 
between the feed inlet and reboiler vapor return nozzle.
In this chapter we will discuss single theoretical stage Bubble-
Point and Dew Point calculations and give examples as to how these 
can be used in our work. Then we’ll discuss the use of the Absorption 
Factor and Stripping Factor chart, which can be used to design distil-
lation towers. In order to use this chart in that way it is necessary to 
consider a distillation tower as two separate towers. The top of the 
tower is considered an absorber. The chart is then used in a different 
way to design the lower part of the distillation tower as a stripper.
Distillation towers were designed using this same chart for nearly 
half a century before the first computer simulations were ever written. 
Indeed, the use of computer simulations in design did not really 
begin until the early 1960s.
As long as we pay attention to the assumptions needed when 
using this chart, it is still a valuable tool that provides an understand-
ing of how the process works and what to expect when conditions 
change.

50.2  Bubble Point and Dew Point Calculations
I will demonstrate how to do these calculations, although we have 
used them elsewhere in this book. But first allow me to point out one of 
the ways in which you might use them, which is to check on the com-
position of lab samples. Suppose we take a bomb sample of the vapor 
and another bomb sample of the liquid from a reflux drum. Working 
through the Bubble Point and Dew Point calculations will provide a 
cross-check on the distillation results. If the lab distillation results don’t 
add up to 100%, then something is missing from the analysis. In which 
case, ask yourself if its light ends that are missing. Perhaps you were 
sloppy in your sample taking and lost vapors in handling or maybe 
sampled a liquid that was hot into a bottle instead of taking a bomb 
sample. Maybe there was residue when the lab performed the distilla-
tion so there was thermal cracking during the distillation test. Either 
way, an analysis that does not add up to 100% indicates something 
amiss, it could be a problem with your calculation, or with the lab sam-
ple, or the lab distillation result.
Norm used to include Bubble Point and Dew Point calculations in 
his refinery troubleshooting seminars, as a test question for any pro-
cess engineers who attended (Fig. 50.1). As only about 10% of the 
engineers could ever answer the question, he has mostly discontin-
ued the use of this in the seminar. But because I like the way the 
seminar was when I first attended in the 1980s, I think we all deserve 
to understand this.
50.2.1  Bubble Point
We are going to use a reboiler as an example (see Fig. 50.2).
When vapor is first formed in the reboiler it is in contact with the 
liquid from which it was formed. We say that the vapor formed while 
in contact with the liquid from which it was formed is “in equilibrium 
with” that liquid. 
Dalton’s law says that the total pressure (PT) (i.e., in the vapor 
space in this reboiler) is the sum of the partial pressures of all the 
components of the vapor.
	
PT = PButane + PPropane	
Where PButane and PPropane are the partial pressures. We could express 
all of these in psia, or all in mm Hg, or all in atmospheres just as long 
as we keep the total pressure and partial pressures all in the same 
units.
Meanwhile Raoult’s law allows us to find the partial pressure of 
a component via its vapor pressure (PV) and its mol% (X) in the liquid 
with which the vapor is in equilibrium.
	
PButane = PV.Butane × X Butane

each component in the vapor (Y):

Let’s put some numbers to this. We’ll take the vapor pressures 
from a Cox vapor pressure chart (Fig. 50.3).

Hence the total pressure PT = 180 + 60 = 240 psia. And now we can 
find the mole percent of each component in the vapor as follows:
	
Butane (180 ÷ 240) × 100 = 75%	
	
Propane (60 ÷ 240) × 100 = 25%	
50.2.2  Dew Point
Looking at Raoult’s law again: The partial pressure of a component is 
given by its vapor pressure multiplied by its mole percentage in the 
liquid phase, just as we said in the Bubble Point calculation:
	
PButane = PV.Butane × XButane

Whereas for the Bubble Point calculation we calculated the vapor 
composition in equilibrium with a liquid, for the Dew Point calculation 
we are given the vapor composition and will calculate the composition 
of the liquid that is in equilibrium with the vapor.
Suppose we did not know the liquid composition for the bottom 
product as was given in the Bubble Point calculation in the previous 
section, but instead we did have the composition of the vapor at the 
operating temperature so that the partial pressure of each component 
was also easy to calculate. We could then find the composition of the 
liquid by calculating the mol percentage of each component in the 
liquid that was in equilibrium with the vapor.

But although using the exact same set of numbers as for the 
Bubble Point calculation may help demonstrate this Dew Point cal-
culation, let’s try a different example to demonstrate the Dew Point 
calculation.
Let’s look at the reflux drum of that same distillation tower that 
we used for the Bubble Point calculation (see Fig. 50.4). Again the 
vapor coming off the reflux drum is in equilibrium with the liquid in 
the reflux drum. Using our Cox vapor pressure chart (Fig. 50.3), we 
find the following.
In this case we do not have the total pressure (PT) in the vapor 
space above the liquid in the reflux drum, but we still want to find the 
composition of the liquid in the reflux drum that is in equilibrium 
with that vapor.

Traditional calculation methods allow us two choices. At this 
point we have two options.

50.2.2.1 Option A 
Make a guess at the total pressure (PT), then use the relationship from 
Dalton’s law to find the partial pressures of each component, as in:
	
Partial Pressure = Mol% in Vapor (Y) × Total Pressure (PT)	
Then having found the partial pressure for each component, we 
could use the relationship from Raoult’s law to find the mol% of 
each component in the liquid which is in equilibrium with the vapor, 
as in:
	
Mol% in Liquid (X ) = Partial Pressure P
Vapor Pressure P

Where i in this case would be either butane or propane.
Having then calculated mol% in the liquid for each component, 
if these do not add up to 100% when added together, one must start

90% Propane

all over again at the beginning of Option A by making a revised 
guess of the total pressure.
This kind of calculation is known as iterative. One would keep 
going through this procedure making new guesses at the total pres-
sure until such time as the mol% for each component, when all added 
together, did reach 100%, no more and no less than 100%. Each time 
we go through a series of calculations like this we call it an iteration. 
This method could also be referred to as an iterative method, iterating 
on Total Pressure.
50.2.2.2 Option B 
The traditional alternate would be to use the relationship with the 
Equilibrium constant, also known as the equilibrium ratio, Ki.
	
yi = Ki × xi	
Where i in this case would be either butane or propane.

In order to use this method we need an extra chart to provide Ki 
for different values of temperature. Such a Ki versus T chart is given 
in Chap. 11 of Chemical Engineering: Vol. II, 3rd ed. by Coulson and 
Richardson.4 Actually this chart in the third edition is in SI units, so 
we would need to convert the temperature from degrees Fahrenheit 
to absolute temperature (i.e., Kelvin or K) in the SI system to use it. 
This is done as follows:

But here at last is a nontraditional and third option for this Dew 
Point calculation. It is a direct calculation using the vapor pressure chart.
50.2.2.3 Option C 
Refer again to Fig. 50.4, the reflux drum of the C3C4 splitter with  
10 mol% Butane and 90 mol% Propane in the vapor, and the reflux 
drum temperature at 100°F.

Now we can check Option C, “Norm’s method,” using our Bubble 
Point calculation method together with the total pressure that we 
have just found (PT = 142.8 psia) and the liquid composition that 
“Norm’s method” gave us for the reflux drum, which was 28.6% 
Butane and 71.4% Propane, to see if we can arrive at the vapor com-
position as shown in Fig. 50.4.

a useful tool.
50.3  The Absorption Factor or Stripping Factor Chart
The Absorption factor or Stripping factor chart, as it is sometimes 
known, is shown in Fig. 50.5. It provides simple calculation methods 
for hydrocarbons when considering either an Absorber tower or a 
Stripper tower in hydrocarbon service, but for combination Absorber-
Stripper towers the calculation procedures become iterative and a lot 
more complex. So for a combination Absorber-Stripper tower it is 
best not to attempt to use this chart. It is actually better to resort to a 
computer simulation. In fact, as a point of historical interest, Norman 
tells me that it was when the idea of combined Absorber-Stripper 
towers was first invented that brought about the use of computer 
simulations so as to handle all the intricate and cumbersome calcula-
tions needed to design them.
But let’s go back to the use of this chart for the separate Absorber 
tower or separate Stripper tower. First, the Absorption Factor, A, is 
defined as:
	
A =
L
V K
x
i 	

A (absorption)
or
1/A (stripping)
Number of theoretical stages
Fraction of light key component now in overhead
(for absorber) or now in bottoms (for stripper)

where 	A = absorption factor
	
L = moles of liquid
	
V = moles of vapor
	
Ki = equilibrium constant or equilibrium ratio, as previously 
defined in bubble point and dew point calculations as:
	
K = y

where

where 	 Pi = partial pressure of component i
	
PT = total pressure
	
PV.I = vapor pressure of component i
	
Then K = P

T 	
Hence the absorption factor is also defined as:
	
×
⋅
A = L
V

T
P i 	
As the action of stripping is taken to be effectively the reverse of 
absorption, the stripping factor for which we write S is defined as the 
reciprocal of the absorption factor. 
Thus:
	
S = 1
A 	
or
	
S = VK
L 	
or
	
×
S = V

The chart assumes that the absorption factor, A, will remain 
fairly constant over the range of theoretical stages. The horizontal 

	
H a n d  C a l c u l a t i o n s  f o r  D i s t i l l a t i o n  To w e r s 	
675
axis describes the number of theoretical stages we have assumed  
50 percent efficiency for the trays in the tower, which means that 
whatever the number of trays in the tower, we then have half that 
number as the number of theoretical stages.
The vertical axis refers to the amount rejected or the amount lost. 
For an absorber tower this is the amount of the light key component 
not absorbed in the lean oil, but when the chart is used for a stripper 
tower, this is the amount not stripped out. In reference to this chart the 
term “amount” that I am using refers to the fraction and not the per-
cent; this just means that the sum of all the fractions of the light key 
component present in the system add up to 1. Whereas if we refer to 
the percent, then the sum of each of the percentages of the light key 
component present would add up to 100. The vertical axis also assumes 
zero light key component in the lean oil, which is often not the case. 
A more classical definition of the vertical axis of this chart can be 
found in either Mass Transfer Operations by R. E. Treybal or Separation 
Processes by C. J. King,5,6 but be warned, neither of these books is for the 
faint of heart, especially in the sections where absorption or stripping are 
concerned. So if you choose to look up these references, please don’t get 
despondent as some of the verbiage (or in places, lack of verbiage) 
would break the heart of the most aspiring and ardent student.
Let us now clarify the use of this handy chart with some examples.
50.3.1  Absorption or Stripping Factor Chart for Absorption
A wet gas stream containing propane as the light key component 
from a cat cracker (FCC) is being fed to an absorber (see Fig. 50.6).
The absorber tower has 20 trays, which for this calculation we 
will assume to be 50 percent efficient so we can say that this tower has 
10 theoretical stages.
The lean oil rate is 2000 barrels per day, and with existing current 
operation there is 90 percent recovery of the propane to the rich oil (i.e., 
10 percent loss of propane to the dry gas). We will assume zero light 
key component in the lean oil (i.e., we are assuming there is no propane 
in the lean oil).
	
Lean Oil Rate = 2000 B/D	
90% Recovery Propane to Rich Oil = 10% Loss Propane to Dry Gas
	
10
100 Loss Propane to Dry Gas

=

20 trays at 50% efficiency = 10 Theoretical Stages
We now plot this existing operation on the chart to find A (the 
absorption factor). See Fig. 50.7. From the chart we find:
	
A = 0.98

C h a p t e r  F i f t y
Management wants to improve recovery of the Propane, so oper-
ations decides to increase the lean oil rate. If the lean oil rate is now 
doubled, and we assume that the vapor rate (V) and equilibrium con-
stant (K) remain the same at the increased lean oil rate as they were at 
the original lean oil rate, then we can simply multiply the absorption 
factor by 2 so as to obtain the new absorption factor at the new lean 
oil rate of 4000 barrels per day, as follows:
Old lean oil rate 2000 B/D

Therefore 
	
A at 4000 B/D = 1.96	
Hence the absorption factor A at 4000 B/D is also doubled, but 
the number of theoretical stages is still 10. Again we refer to the chart 
and this time plot the condition at the new lean oil rate of 4000 barrels 
per day. (See Fig. 50.8.)
	
Lean Oil Rate 4000 B/D
	
Theoretical Stages = 10
	
A4000 B/D = 1.96
Assume no propane in the lean oil. From the chart (Fig. 50.8):

This represents an approximate 10 percent increase in recovery of 
propane to rich oil by doubling the lean oil rate.
You may note that in order to use this chart we have had to 
sketch in a line to represent the appropriate line for the value of the 
absorption factor between existing lines for A on the chart. Also, 
we should be cautious about assuming that there is none of the 
light key component (in this case Propane) in the lean oil, as this is 
not always true.
If you find that the light key component is present in the lean 
oil, then the method described above may not be valid, and you 
should refer to one of the classical reference texts such as Mass 
Transfer Operations by Treybal or Separation Processes by King5,6 for 
guidance as to how to proceed with the calculation. Note that the 
higher the recovery of the light key component, the more critical it 
becomes that there should be no light key component in the lean 
oil, otherwise the method we show here may not produce correct 
results.
50.3.2  Stripping Factor or Absorption Factor Chart  
for Stripping
50.3.2.1 Case I: Increasing the Number of Trays
A de-ethanizer tower has 10 trays, we will assume the trays have 
50 percent efficiency in this case, hence, there will be five theoretical 
stages. Ninety percent of the Ethane is being stripped out of the 
Naphtha stream, thus 10 percent of the Ethane fed to the tower in 
the Naphtha stream is left in the bottoms product (Fig. 50.9).
Summarizing:
	
10 Trays at 50% Efficiency = 5 Theoretical Stages
	
90% Rejection of Ethane Overhead (V2)
Therefore

Refer to Fig. 50.10. We will now use the lines that we used in the 
previous example for absorption as A for the reciprocal of A, that is, 
we will now take the alternate use of these lines as
	
1
A = Stripping Factor S

From the chart,

If we now double the number of trays so that there are now  
20 trays with 50 percent efficiency, then the number of theoretical 
stages will now be 10, but the stripping factor S will remain the 
same: 1.2.

Summarizing:
	
Old Number of Trays = 10
	
Efficiency of Old Trays = 50%
	
Number of Theoretical Stages = 5
	
Ethane remaining in bottoms = 10% of Ethane in feed
	
Stripping factor = 1.2
New Situation:
	
New Number of Trays = 20
	
Efficiency of Trays = 50%
	
Number of Theoretical Stages = 10
	
Stripping factor S = 1.2
To find the new amount of Ethane remaining in the bottoms now 
that we have doubled the number of theoretical stages, we need to 
refer to the chart again. See Fig. 50.10. Follow the curved line for 
“1/A = 1.2” to the point where it intersects the vertical line for 10 
theoretical stages.
Next read off the fraction of Ethane that now remains in the bot-
toms from the vertical axis on the left to find, that is, percent of ethane 
from the feed now remaining in the bottoms. That is equivalent to  
97 percent of ethane in the naphtha feed now stripped out.
Summarizing, we now have:
	
Theoretical Stages = 10	
	
S = 1.2	
	
Light key component Ethane from feed now in bottoms = 0.03
1
=
3
100
= 3%
Therefore, 
Light key component Ethane from feed now stripped out = (100 – 3)
(100)
= 97%
	
50.3.2.2 Case II: Increasing the Rate of Stripping Vapor
In this case the de-ethanizer shown in Fig. 50.9 is stripping out  
80 percent of the ethane from the naphtha feed stream. Thus there is 
20 percent of the ethane from the feed left in the bottoms. There are 

	
684	
C h a p t e r  F i f t y
10 trays with 50 percent efficiency, therefore we have five theoreti-
cal stages.
Summarizing:
	
Number of Trays = 10
	
Tray Efficiency = 50%
	
Number of Theoretical Stages = 5
	
=
=
Light key component Ethane stripped out = 80%
80
100
0.8
1
	
	
Light key component ethane remaining in bottoms = 100 – 80
100
= 20%
= 0.2
1
	
Therefore, 
Value for the vertical axis = 0.2
We now refer to the chart shown in Fig. 50.11. Plot 0.2 (feed ethane 
remaining in bottoms) on the vertical axis and 5 (theoretical stages) on 
the horizontal axis. The intersection on the chart gives a stripping factor 
of 0.92. Thus:
Ethane from feed now in bottoms = 0.2
Theoretical Stages = 5
Then from the chart:
	
1
A = S = 0.92 	
 
Suppose we now double the vapor rate by doubling the reboiler 
duty. There will still be five theoretical stages. But the stripping factor 
is now doubled because we are assuming that the naphtha feed rate 
and bottoms product rate remain constant. Thus:
×
1
A = S = V

K
If 
	
VNew = 2 × VOld 	
and
LNew = LOld

685
K = Equilibrium constant and remains unchanged because the 
pressure and temperature are constant. Therefore 
	
SNew = 2 × SOld	
	
SNew = 2 × 0.92	
	
 = 1.84	
Again summarizing:
	
Theoretical Stages = 5	
Ethane as light key from feed now in bottoms at old vapor rate = 0.2
1
	
Stripping factor S at old vapor rate = 0.92	
New situation:
	
  Theoretical Stages = 5	
	
New Vapor Rate = 2 × Old Vapor Rate	
Therefore 
	
New Stripping Factor S = 1.84	
Therefore 
	
1
A = 1.84
	
Referring to Fig. 50.11, follow the line for five theoretical stages to 
the point where it meets the line for a stripping factor of 1.84. Next 
read the new value for the ethane from feed remaining in the bottoms 
as 0.02. Thus for this new situation with double the vapor rate:
Theoretical Stages = 5
Stripping Factor S = 1.84
From the chart,
Ethane as light key from feed now in bottoms at new double vapor rate

Hence by doubling the vapor rate on this particular tower we 
increased the amount of ethane stripped out from the feed from  
80 percent to 98 percent, so we increased the amount stripped out  
18 percent based on the amount of ethane in the feed.

50.4  Conclusion
As with all calculation methods, remember to pay attention to the 
assumptions made and make sure that they are valid for the process 
with which you are working.

CHAPTER 51
Computer Modeling 
and Control
W
hen I first went to work in the process industry in 1964, 
computer control was in its infancy. The use of computer 
modeling of distillation towers was just beginning. I believe 
I was the first person in the oil refining industry to model a crude 
distillation tower with: 
• Multiple pumparounds
• Side-stream steam strippers
• Multiple side-product draw-offs
• Two-stage overhead system
In 1968, I was the technical support engineer on the crude distil-
lation unit at the Amoco Refinery in Whiting, Indiana. My job was to 
implement a new computer control program for the automated 
operation of the unit. Basically, I was to convince the operators that 
automated, direct, on-line computer control could produce more 
consistent product specifications than an experienced panel board 
operator. One of the factors that led to my failure in this assignment 
was that in 1968 I was not sure if this was true. Now, in 2014, I’m still 
not convinced that direct computer control of refinery processes is 
always the best approach.
The situation regarding computer modeling is somewhat more 
straightforward. No engineering calculation can be better than the 
assump­tions used as a basis to carry out the calculations.
51.1  Modeling a Propane-Propylene Splitter
I had been hired to review the design for a new 12,000 BSD propane-
propylene splitter for a chemical plant in Convent, Louisiana. The 
tower was intended to be a replacement for an existing 10,000 BSD 
propylene-propane splitter. The incremental capacity of 2000 BSD would 
economically justify the $3,000,000 investment for the new splitter.
689

	
690	
C h a p t e r  F i f t y - O n e
I asked the operators why the existing tower was limited to its 
current 10,000 BSD capacity. They responded by noting that 
above 10,000 BSD of feed, the concentration of propane in the 
propylene overhead product (see Fig. 51.1) would exceed the  
2 percent specification.
Dear reader, note that I’m already in trouble. My client had asked 
me to review the design for the new tower. No one had asked me to 
review the operation of the existing splitter. However, if anybody had 
asked what I was doing, I had a ready response: I’m gathering data to 
verify the accuracy of the computer model used in the design of the 
new tower. I’m collecting operating data to check the following 
parameters assumed in the computer design of the new splitter:
• Tray efficiency
• Relative volatility for the propylene-propane system (i.e., the 
“equation of state”)

I asked the operators to increase the splitter feed rate by 500 BSD 
to 10,500 BSD. When they complied, the concentration of propane in 
the overhead propylene product increased from 2 to 3 percent.
“How about increasing the reflux rate from 20,000 BSD to 
21,000 BSD? We have to keep the reflux ratio constant as we increase 
the feed rate,” I explained.
“Can’t be done, Norm,” responded the panel board operator. 
“The 20,000 BSD reflux rate is our maximum. The reflux flow control 
valve is programmed to avoid excessive reflux rates.”
“Excessive? What’s excessive about 21,000 BSD of reflux? The 
reflux flow control valve is only 45 percent open. Let's try for 
21,000 BSD,” I persisted.
“Now, Norm, it’s part of the computer control logic not to exceed 
20,000 BSD of reflux. It’s part of the Black Box. These sorts of param-
eter limits are imbedded in the computer control logic,” explained the 
board operator. “Frank Skorski spent a lot of time on the computer 
control of this splitter. I imagine Frank knew a hell of a lot more about 
computer control than you. He was the computer control engineer 
here in Convent for 12 years. Norm, I don’t think you should be 
second-guessing Mr. Skorski.”
“Let’s call Mr. Skorski and get his okay to raise the reflux rate,” I 
suggested.
“No, we can’t,” replied the operator.
“Why?”
“Because Frank Skorski has been dead for three years.”
It required three hours to get the artificial limit on the reflux rate 
cancelled. Frank Skorski’s 20,000 BSD reflux limit had been well 
founded. It reflected a lack of reboiler duty (see Fig. 51.1) needed to 
generate the reflux. The splitter was short of reboiler duty because 
the condensate steam trap was undersized. A larger steam trap had 
been installed last year. However, Mr. Skorski had failed to return 
from the spirit world to remove the reflux limit.
Gradually we increased the tower feed rate to 12,000 BSD, and 
the reflux rate to 24,000 BSD. The online gas chromatograph stayed at 
the desired 2 percent propane in the propylene overhead product.
51.1.1  Predicting Tray Efficiency vs. Relative Volatility
Why had my client decided to build a new splitter when the existing 
tower had the required capacity?
The process design engineer for the project informed me that the 
existing tower did not have sufficient tray hydraulic capacity to han-
dle the required feed rate of 12,000 BSD and the required reflux rate of 
28,000 BSD. But what was the basis for the 28,000 BSD of reflux? 
Hadn’t I just demonstrated that a 24,000 BSD reflux rate was suffi-
cient? True, the tower would flood at 28,000 BSD reflux. True, the com-
puter model indicated that 28,000 BSD of reflux was needed. But was 
the computer model used for this propane-propylene splitter correct?

51.1.2  The Input Data Problem
When we model any piece of process equipment, some of the data we 
supply to the computer to create the model are derived from the observed 
performance of existing equipment in similar service. For instance:
• Heat exchangers—Fouling factors
• Compressors—Adiabatic compression efficiency
• Centrifugal pumps—Clearance between impeller, pump case 
and wear ring
• Distillation towers—Tray efficiency and relative volatility
The relative volatility is a measure of the ease of separation between 
the light and heavy components. For ideal components it is the ratio of 
the vapor pressure of the more volatile component divided by the 
vapor pressure of the less volatile component. For nonideal compo-
nents, the relative volatility is calculated from the “equation of state.”
The equation of state is a set of empirically derived equations. 
When you set up a computer model for any process involving vapor-
liquid equilibrium, you must select an equation of state from perhaps 
two dozen choices. Experience is the only real guide in making the 
most accurate selection.
When you set up a computer model for any distillation process, 
you must select a tray efficiency. Tray efficiencies (for mechanically 
intact trays) vary from 30 to 90 percent. Experience is the only guide 
in making the least wrong selection.
51.1.3  Establishing a Firm Design Basis
The design engineer for the new propylene splitter had used the 
following values in his model:
• Relative volatility = 1.18
• Tray efficiency = 65 percent
I had used in my computer model:
• Relative volatility = 1.21
• Tray efficiency = 75 percent
I had arbitrarily manipulated tray efficiency and relative volatil-
ity to force my computer model to match the observed plant data. It 
might seem that by arbitrarily selecting both the relative volatility 
and tray efficiency for my computer model, my calculations would 
be little better than a guess.
My computer model was indeed a guess, but an educated guess. 
It’s an extrapolation from a known data point—that is, the observed 
operation of the existing splitter at a feed rate of 12,000 BSD and a 
reflux rate of 24,000 BSD.

	
C o m p u t e r  M o d e l i n g  a n d  C o n t r o l 	
693
That’s it! Computer modeling in the process industry is at best a 
very approximate extrapolation technique. The model may begin to 
reflect reality insofar as it is based on a wide range of accurate plant 
data.
This suggests that an experienced process design engineer can 
design a plant based on rules of thumb, prototypes, and experience 
better than the novice engineer backed up by the latest in computer 
technology.
51.1.4  A Monument Rises
I forgot to mention something. I forgot to mention that the founda-
tion for the new propane-propylene splitter had already been con-
structed. A meeting was held to review my report regarding the 
design of the new splitter. My comment that the existing tower was 
adequate for the projected 12,000 BSD feed rate was not well received. 
My recommendation that the new tower not be built was greeted with 
open hostility. My client’s design engineer explained, “Mr. Lieberman, 
data such as your one-day plant test imply the existing tower is ade-
quate. But the bulk of the available information, based on two years of 
computer simulations, has established that a new tower is required.
“Furthermore, Mr. Lieberman, we are terminating your contract 
immediately. We never asked you to look into the operation of the 
existing splitter. Your entire attitude has been politically incorrect.”
Well, the new tower was built, a monument to ancient Greek philosophy, 
“Facts don’t count.”
51.2  Computer Control
On-line, closed-loop computer control frequently does more harm 
than good. This is not a popular opinion, but it is my opinion. Per-
haps my observations only apply to refinery process units, rather 
than chemical plants in general. But I know what I’ve seen.
• Using computer control as an alternate to training panel 
board operators in the true nature of process control of their 
unit does not work. Reason: When a key process parameter 
changes, it is not recognized by the operators.
• Using computer control is fine, as long as the technician who 
developed and implemented the control strategy is still 
around. Once the computer control ascends to the status of a 
“Black Box,” it becomes impossible to adjust the operating 
parameters to accommodate a changed situation.
• Restricting the authority of the panel board operator to over-
ride the computer control leads to a gradual loss of knowl-
edge. With time, the panel board operator will fail to understand 
the interrelationship of the various operating parameters.  

	
694	
C h a p t e r  F i f t y - O n e
Then, when I come into the control room and note the reflux 
rate is falling when it should be rising, I’ll hear, “The com-
puter handles the reflux rate. It’s not my responsibility.” 
This is abusive use of computer technology. The operator 
has been turned into an observer and is no longer actively 
controlling the process.
• The best operators should not be used full time on the panel. 
This happens because the computer control has become too 
complex for the average operator. The best operators need to 
spend half their time outside on the unit.
I have often been persuaded that computer control is really work-
ing very well on a particular process unit. But more often than not, a 
closer investigation reveals the truth of what I learned in 1968. An 
experienced, intelligent, committed operator, fully involved in his or 
her duties, will outperform computer control on most occasions.
Mr. Shinsky of Foxboro, a famous expert in process control, once 
explained to me that most control problems are really process limits. 
Mr. Shinsky said that for computer control to succeed, we must 
update the physical plant limitation data. Nothing has changed in 
30 years to make his wise words less true.
51.3  Material Balance Problems in Computer Modeling
Many computer models fail to represent reality because of faulty 
input of feed compositions. Common causes of wrong input of feed 
compositions are:
• Liquid stream compositions that do not reflect the lighter 
components in the sample. A sample of gasoline is collected 
in a bottle. The methane and half the ethane are flashed off as 
the bottle warms on the laboratory bench.
• Vapor stream compositions that do not reflect the heavier 
components in the sample. Half the pentane and most of the 
hexane condense out in the gas sample bladder, as the blad-
der cools waiting for the chemist to run the gas through the 
chromatograph.
One of my friends, Steve, made such an error in designing a debu-
tanizer. He failed to account for the methane and ethane in the existing 
debutanizer feed stream. The sample from the 25-psig feed vessel was 
taken in a bottle. The lighter components weathered off prior to lab 
analysis. The results were, for Steve, rather catastrophic. The debutanizer 
overhead product could not be fully condensed. The non-condensable 
vapor pressured up the overhead reflux drum. The non-condensables 
were vented, along with 30 percent of the butane, to the flare. Steve was 

	
C o m p u t e r  M o d e l i n g  a n d  C o n t r o l 	
695
promoted to manager of employee relations, an important but poten-
tially less critical position.
51.3.1  How Steve Could Have Avoided becoming Employee 
Relations Manager
	
1.	 Obtain a gas chromatographic analysis of the debutanizer 
feed in mole percent.
 
2. Multiply the mole percent of each component by the vapor pres-
sure of that component at the temperature in the feed vessel at 
the time the sample was drawn. This is the partial pressure of 
each component.
	
3.	 Add up the sum of the partial pressures to obtain the calculated 
total vapor pressure. Compare this calculated vapor pressure (in 
psia) to the actual pressure in the feed vessel (i.e., 25 psig or  
40 psia).
	
4.	 If the calculated vapor pressure is close to the observed pres-
sure, all is well. If the calculated vapor pressure is well below 
the observed pressure, proceed to step 5.
	
5.	 Get a fresh sample from the feed vessel. Heat it up by a few 
degrees—just enough to fill a gas bladder with the evolved 
gas. Send this gas bladder to the lab for gas chrome analysis.
	
6.	 Take the mole percent liquid composition obtained in step 1. 
Using the composition obtained in step 5 as a guide, manu-
ally add in the lighter components to the calculated mole per-
cent liquid composition, until the calculated vapor pressure 
equals the observed pressure in the feed vessel.
51.3.2  Missing Heavier Components from a Vapor Sample
Steve compounded his error in the design of a sponge oil absorber 
used to recover heavier components from a waste gas stream. In this 
case, my friend failed to account for the large amount of isopentane 
that was recoverable from the methane and ethane waste gas. To 
avoid this error, Steve should have:
 
1. Submit a sample of the waste gas for analysis to obtain a mole 
percent composition.
 
2. Divide the mole percent of each component by the vapor 
pressure of the pure component at the temperature of the 
drum from which the sample was taken.
 
3. Sum up the above numbers. If the total is close to the recipro-
cal of the drum pressure (in psia) from which the sample was 
taken, all is well. If this sum is less than the reciprocal of the 
drum pressure, proceed to step 4.

	
696	
C h a p t e r  F i f t y - O n e
	
4.	 Get a fresh bladder sample of the vapor from the drum. Con-
dense out some of the vapor to liquid with cold water or ice. 
Obtain a gas chrome analysis of this liquid.
	
5.	 Take the mole percent vapor composition obtained in step 1. 
Using the composition obtained in step 4 as a guide, manu-
ally add in the heavier components to the mole percent vapor 
composition until the calculated sum of the:
 
Mole percent divided by vapor pressure
	
	 equals the reciprocal of the total absolute pressure in the 
drum from which the sample was taken.
51.3.3  The Garbage Rule
All I’m doing is checking the validity of my material balance input 
data. I’m using bubble-point and dew-point calculations to validate 
that my material balance represents reality. In the rush to create our 
computer models for process equipment, we may sometimes forget 
the fundamental rule of computer technology:
GARBAGE IN = GARBAGE OUT
If you don’t believe me, ask Steve, now a well-paid but bored vice 
president of human resources for a well-known Texas corporation 
with headquarters in Houston.
51.4  Fourth Edition Update Comments
I wrote this chapter in 2002. Now, as I review computer control and 
computer modeling for this fourth edition in 2014, my attitude 
toward both aspects of computer technology has not been altered:
• Computer modeling must be based on an operating process 
system in similar service.
• Computer control only works in the long run if the control 
technician understands how to run his or her controls in a 
manual operating mode, and occasionally practice such man-
ual control.
In the 700 plus process troubleshooting seminars I have instructed 
in the past 31 years, no experienced plant operator or design engineer 
has taken issue with the above two points.

CHAPTER 52
Field 
Troubleshooting 
Process Problems
H
umans have instinctive drives, among which is the desire to 
fix things. I’d bet, having read this far, that you have that 
inner desire to make repairs.
Growing inside me, growing stronger as I age, is a frantic, fanati-
cal need to repair mechanical devices. There are times when I’ve 
risked my life on a rickety scaffold to measure an outlet temperature 
from a heat exchanger.
My career is studded with the quick-fix solution to process 
problems. The quick fix that lost me a $100,000 engineering fee to 
redesign a fractionation tower. That overpowering desire to impose 
my will on the inanimate world, regardless of the consequences.
52.1  De-ethanizer Flooding
• Place: Texaco Refinery, Convent, Louisiana
• Time: 11:45 p.m., December 24, 2001
• Weather: Cold, windy, rainy
• Problem: Premature de-ethanizer flooding
• Contract value: $240,000 (U.S.)
Liz, Jerry, Mike, and I were partners in expanding the capacity of 
a naphtha reformer plant producing aromatic base stocks. The bot-
tleneck was the reboiled de-ethanizer, limited by flooding. Our job 
was to produce a process design to de-bottleneck the reformer from 
697

	
698	
C h a p t e r  F i f t y - T w o
40,000 BSD (barrels per day) up to 50,000 BSD of feed. But I was sty-
mied by the following:
• The calculated percent of jet or vapor flood was 65 percent  
at current feed rates (40,000 BSD).
• The calculated percent of downcomer or liquid flood was 
70 percent at 40,000 BSD.
• The de-ethanizer was known to flood at 41,000 BSD feed.
• The tower had been opened twice before, found to be both 
clean and in good mechanical condition.
• In theory, the tower should be adequate at 50,000 BSD with-
out any modifications.
I didn’t know what to do. But fate intervened. A tube leak on 
an upstream heat exchanger necessitated a short unit outage. The 
de-ethanizer tower was opened for one day so that we could carry 
out an internal inspection of the trays.
I crawled through the tower with Mike. Cold washwater was still 
cascading down the tray decks. The trays were old-style valve trays. All 
30 trays had a 0.5-inch valve cap lift (see Fig. 52.1). All 30 trays except, I 
found, the bottom tray, which had only a 0.25-inch valve cap lift.
Now my calculated DP dry (i.e., the pressure drop of the vapor 
flowing through the opening between the tray deck and the valve 
cap) was 2 inches of liquid with the 0.5-inch lift. With a 0.25-inch 
valve lift, the vapor velocity would double. The DP dry would 
increase with the square of the velocity to 8 inches. Further, the height 
of clear liquid in the downcomer would increase by an extra 6 inches 
of liquid. This would certainly flood the downcomer from the bottom 
tray. (See Chap. 3.)
Here, then, was my naphtha reformer bottleneck—too small a 
valve cap lift in the bottom tray of the de-ethanizer tower.
52.1.1  What’s Next?
The wind was brutal as Mike and I, soaked and bruised, crawled out 
of the manway.

“Well,” asked the night mechanical foreman, “okay if I close the 
manways? It’s 1:30 a.m. My guys are out here on overtime pay.”
“No,” I answered. “Pull out the bottom tray panels. I want you to 
drill sieve holes between the valve caps. I’ll tell you how many sieve 
holes I want in 20 minutes.”
I explained my plan to Liz and Jerry. It was too late to find new 
valve caps with a 0.5-inch lift. The next best thing was to increase the 
bottom tray open area with sieve holes to match the open area of 
the other 29 tray decks. Sixty 0.75-inch sieve holes would be drilled 
on the bottom tray panels.
Jerry and Liz agreed with enthusiasm. Mike, however, was 
horrified.
“Norm, what’s all this about?” asked Mike.
“Look, Mike, I know what I’m doing. Have some confidence 
in me.”
“Norm,” Mike whispered, “one of two things are going to hap-
pen with your stupid sieve holes. Either your idea will work, or it 
won’t work.”
“Get to the point, Mike, I’m cold and getting colder.”
“The point is, if your damn sieve holes don’t work, Texaco will 
think we don’t know what we’re doing and we’ll lose the contract. 
The point is, if your sieve hole idea does work, Texaco will cancel the 
project because the bottleneck will be gone. Either way we are going 
to lose $200,000. That’s my point,” Mike screamed.
“Kindly do not yell at me,” I answered calmly.
“Okay, Norm, then kindly explain to me your purpose for drilling 
the sieve holes.”
“Mike, if you don’t know, I can’t explain it.”
The sieve holes were drilled, the plant bottleneck was elimi-
nated, we lost the contract, Mike is still angry, Texaco is now Motiva. 
But I’m happy. But if you don’t know why, dear reader, I can’t 
explain it.
52.2  The Elements of Troubleshooting
I once found a blue sapphire in Australia. It was imbedded in a gravel 
bed. It had been buried after a volcanic explosion in the gravel of the 
old stream bed for 65 million years. It was easy to find. All I had to do 
was to dig up and sift through 4 tons of gravel. It only took six days. 
But I knew it was there, so it was easy to find.
Troubleshooting is like that. Part of every problem, embedded in 
the problem itself, is the solution. The solution is a component of the 
problem. Each problem consists of a number of components. And one 
of these components is the answer you seek.
The first element of troubleshooting is an absolute belief that 
the solution exists. An absolute belief that you can find the answer. 

	
700	
C h a p t e r  F i f t y - T w o
An ab­solute belief that it’s only a matter of time and determination. An 
understanding that you have to do the job alone. No one can help you 
because no one else is dedicated enough. No one else cares enough.
The second element of troubleshooting is direct field observa-
tions. There is a piece of data you lack to intellectually grasp the prob-
lem. The difficulty is you don’t know what that piece of data is. It’s 
like looking for gems in the Australian outback. Often, a client asks 
me why I so desperately wanted some particular pressure. My answer 
is that it was physically possible to make the pressure measurement. 
I want all the data available because I don’t know beforehand which 
piece of data I really need. So I want all of it. How can you tell what 
samples, temperatures, and pressures are available if you don’t go 
out to the field and look?
My personal preference is to obtain all plant data using my own 
tools, wrenches, gauges, temperature probes, and fittings myself. In 
my toolbox, I have every 0.25- to 1.5-inch pipe fitting known to man-
kind. I also have a set of instrument fittings and every possible adapter 
to convert from piping threads to instrument threads.
I routinely drag 30 pounds of bushings, elbows, sleeves, and nip-
ples all over the world. I never know when I’ll need a 1- to 0.5-inch 
reducer sleeve to make that definitive pressure measurement.
But why do I have to unscrew that piping plug myself? Why 
must I use my own hands to pipe-up that pressure gauge? Why, at 
72 years old, do I insist on climbing up 120 feet to a tower vapor line?
First, the physical activity relaxes me. Also, it gets me away from 
other people. What I need is time to reflect on the problem without 
distraction. Also, if I get the data myself, I know they are correct. Or 
at least I know the range of uncertainty of the data.
Basically, I just like climbing tall distillation towers and working 
with pipe wrenches and fittings. It’s fun. I guess one element of trou-
bleshooting is to think it’s all a game, a challenge to be enjoyed. Hon-
estly, I’d do it for free.
52.3  Field Calculations
Some people use calculators or computers. I have my K&E slide rule. I 
used to be a computer guy in the days of punch cards and Fortran. But 
now I always take an electrochemical computer with me on all field 
troubleshooting assignments. It fits compactly beneath my hard hat.
The ability to manipulate field data as it is obtained is the best 
way to speed success in field troubleshooting. For example, how 
much air is leaking into the incinerator duct at the sulfur plant in 
Aruba? What size hole in the duct is needed to allow this much air 
leakage? I can calculate the air flow based on the observed tempera-
ture rise in the duct due to afterburning of hydrogen sulfide in the 
incinerator effluent. Now I know that I need to find, and did find just 
yesterday, a 4-inch by 4-inch hole in the duct.

What you need to do is carry into the field:
• Your technical training
• The tools of the trade
• The fanatical desire to solve the problem
• The absolute certainty that the solution exists and is accessible 
to you
Most of the equations you will need for common process equip-
ment have been presented in the preceding chapters. One of the pur-
poses that we had in writing this book was to make such information 
available for field troubleshooting.
52.4  Troubleshooting Tools—Your Wrench
The tools of my trade are:
• Gear wrench. This is a two-headed wrench. One end is a 
valve wrench for turning valve handles. The other end has 
adjustable jaws for piping and fittings.
• 6-inch crescent wrench for instrument fittings.
• 12-inch crescent wrench for pressure gauges.
• A 16-inch aluminum adjustable pipe wrench (steel is cheaper 
but twice as heavy).
• A short, curved knife for cutting through insulation.
• A digital pressure gauge that reads both vacuum and pres-
sures to 30 psig.
• An infrared temperature gun that reads up to 800°F.
• An infrared temperature probe with a laser pointer that reads 
up to 500°F.
• Spare, 9-V batteries for the last three items.
• A hand-powered vacuum pump used for obtaining flue gas 
and samples of gas under vacuum down to 25 inches of Hg. 
This is a $30 item purchased in an auto supply parts store. 
Its conventional use is to evacuate brake fluid lines.
• Plastic tubing.
• 5 ft of coiled stainless steel 0.25-inch tubing, used as a sample 
cooler.
• Litmus paper for pH.
• Lead acetate paper to check for hydrogen sulfide.
• Inflatable plastic bag to catch gas samples.

	
702	
C h a p t e r  F i f t y - T w o
• About 60 assorted piping fittings and 10 assorted instrument 
fittings.
• A section of 0.5-inch stainless tubing with an instrument fit-
ting at one end and a piping fitting on the other end.
52.5  Field Measurements
My success as a process engineer is in proportion to my ability to take 
accurate field measurements, most often to obtain a differential pres-
sure between two points. Since the differential pressure is usually 
only a small portion of the total system pressure, consistent, if not 
precise measurement is critical.
Use a digital pressure gauge of the smallest range. If you are 
checking pressures on a distillation tower that operates at 80 psig, use 
a 0- to 100-psig gauge, not a 0- to 500-psig gauge. The larger pressure 
range gauge has a potential error five times greater than the smaller 
range gauge. Digital gauges are always preferred because everyone 
reads the same pressure. Also, the orientation of the gauge does not 
affect its reading. A good-quality digital gauge will cost $500 to $1000 
(U.S.). Radio transmissions affect the digital gauge reading, so shut 
off your radio when taking such a reading.
Velocity affects pressure. Figure 52.2 illustrates the problem. This 
is plant data from a hydro-desulferization unit. The 10-psi increase 
in the pressure through the exchanger is due to the reduction in 
velocity, resulting from flowing from the 6-inch exchanger inlet into 
the 8-inch exchanger outlet line. Certainly there are frictional losses 
through the exchanger, but this is more than offset by the conversion 
of kinetic energy into pressure.

703
When measuring a differential pressure, changes in elevation 
between the two pressure points should be corrected to take into 
account the density of the flowing fluid (one psi equals 2.31 ft of water). 
(See Chap. 48 for an example.)
Avoid “dynamic pressure” readings. Figure 52.3 illustrates the 
problem. The kinetic energy of the high-velocity inlet fluid will be 
converted to pressure as it impacts the vessel wall at P1. This is called 
a dynamic pressure. The pressure at P2 will be lower than P1. The cor-
rect pressure to read is the static pressure measured at P2.
Account for nozzle entrance and exit losses. (See Fig. 52.4.) The 
pressure at P2 is lower than P1 due to the acceleration of vapor through 
the overhead vapor line. That is, the pressure of the vapor is partly 
converted to velocity. To correct the pressure at P2 to static pressure at 
P1, add the nozzle exit loss as follows:
V
Nozzle exit loss (psi) = 0.3
(DV)
(62.3)
(27.7)

 where DV = density of vapor in lb/ft3
	
V = vapor velocity in overhead line in ft/s
Better yet, just measure the pressure at P1 and forget about the 
corrections for nozzle losses. On the other hand, the fluid flowing 
from a nozzle into a vessel will usually gain in pressure (pressure 
recovery).
Don’t forget about time. Pressures in flowing systems naturally 
fluctuate by a few percent. To avoid the distortion of an observed dif-
ferential pressure due to such fluctuations, select a reference pressure 
somewhere in the process. After each pressure measurement, recheck 
P1

the reference pressure gauge. Correct your recent measurements for 
the observed pressure fluctuations.
I could write a whole book just about making pressure and flow 
and level and temperature measurements in the field. Actually, I have. 
(Troubleshooting Process Operations, 3d ed., Pennwell Publications, 
Tulsa, Oklahoma.) But I’ve made my point. Making field measure-
ments is complicated. There are too many variables to turn the job 
over to the outside unit operator. There are so many sources of poten-
tial error to consider and eliminate. There is only one way to make 
sure any job is done right and that’s to do it yourself. At least you will 
know which data are reliable and which data are questionable.
52.5.1  Indirect Flow Measurement
Relief valves, control valves, and isolation valves are subject to leak-
age. In a typical modern petroleum refinery, about 0.4 wt.% of crude 
charge is sacrificed in this wasteful manner, mainly due to valve leak-
age. Knowing that a valve is leaking is not much help in getting it 
fixed, unless an approximate idea can be obtained as to how much is 
leaking. Let me give an example as to how I handle this problem.
Assume that a closed gate valve on a 3-inch, 200°F, hot water line 
is leaking. We are sure that the valve is leaking because the piping 
downstream of the closed gate valve is hot to the touch. To estimate 
the leaking flow rate, proceed as follows:
 
1. Using your surface temperature infrared gun, check the temper-
ature of the pipe immediately downstream of the leaking valve.

3. Calculate the observed sensible heat loss per pound of water. 
If the observed temperature difference between step 1 and 
step 2 is 20°F, then heat loss per pound is 20 Btu per pound of 
water.
 
4. Calculate the observed ambient heat loss from the 20 ft of 
3-inch pipe (with an area of 16 ft2) using the formula:
Heat loss = (DT) (U) area
     where:
• Heat loss = Btu per hour.
• DT = Temperature difference between the average pipe 
surface temperature and the ambient air temperature, °F.
• U = Heat transfer coefficient. Use about 2 for skin tem-
peratures of 200 to 300°F in still air. Use about 4 for skin 
temperatures of 400 to 600°F in windy conditions.
• Area of pipe, ft2.
  For our example:
• Heat loss = (180 to 80°F) (2) (6) = 3200 Btu/hr.
• The (180 to 80°F) term is based on the average skin tem-
perature of the pipe of 180°F and the ambient temperature 
of 80°F.
 
5. Divide the observed ambient heat loss (step 4) by the 
observed sensible heat loss per pound of water. In our 
example:
• 3200 Btu/hr ÷ 20 Btu/lb = 160 lb/hr
 
 This is the amount of 200°F water leaking through the closed 
gate.
If the pipe is insulated, just make the skin temperature measure-
ments on the external insulation. The heat transfer coefficients (between 
2 and 4) will still apply in the temperature ranges noted above.
52.5.2  Using the Infrared Surface Temperature Gun
Checking a pipe surface temperature using a temperature gun 
requires following several rules:
• The gun needs to be 1 to 6 inches from the surface. Do not be 
fooled by the laser pointer. Just having the red dot on the sur-
face will not give you a good reading on a small pipe if you 
are 5 ft away. If it’s a large vessel, the longer distance is okay.
• A shiny reflective surface will give erratically low readings. 
Stainless steel surfaces are bad. Rub some tar or black paint 
on such a surface. Wait until it stops smoking. A rough, rusty, 

	
706	
C h a p t e r  F i f t y - T w o
black, or brown surface is best. For cool (100°F) pipes, surface 
conditions are not important.
• Try for the highest temperature reading possible. The angle 
you hold the gun at, relative to the pipe, does affect the 
observed temperature.
• Don’t waste time and money on an instrument with an emis-
sivity reading. Just make sure the pipe surface is nonreflec-
tive by using the tar, black paint, or blackish grease. I’ve had 
no luck with the emissivity settings.
Use of the surface temperature gun, which is my main trouble-
shooting tool, requires consistency, not accuracy.
52.5.3  Pressure Measurement Problem
Often one has to obtain a pressure reading on a vapor-filled line. Most 
technicians will realize that locating the gauge below the vapor line 
will result in an erroneously high reading because the line will fill 
with condensate. But suppose the pressure gauge is located above 
the vapor line. If the line is self-draining (no loops or pockets), will a 
true pressure reading result?  It depends on the diameter and length 
of the pressure sensing line. A sensing line less than 10 inches is fine. If 
the pressure sensing line is 2 inches or larger, it will be self-drain-
ing and that is good. But if the pressure sensing line is smaller 
than 0.75 inch, the line will not be self-draining. The condensate will 
accumulate in the vertical section of the line, and the indicated pres-
sure reading will be too low. Why this happens I cannot say. But I have 
observed this problem for both hydrocarbon and aqueous systems.
52.6  Troubleshooting Methods
With tool bag in hand, you now set off to troubleshoot the process 
problem. There are three alternative methods to consider:
• Experience
• Trial and error
• Insight
To a large extent, experience does not help me solve very many 
problems. It isn’t that I don’t see the same problem repeatedly.  
I certainly do. It’s just that a problem has so many different faces that I fail 
to recognize the true nature of the problem. Superficially, it looks unique.
Relying on experience wastes time. Relying on experience as a 
guide drags me into the quagmire of trial and error. I have an inner 
weakness for trial-and-error solutions. It’s inertia and laziness on my 
part. It’s part of my propensity, carried forward from childhood, for 
the quick fix without the commensurate effort.

	
F i e l d  Tr o u b l e s h o o t i n g  P r o c e s s  P r o b l e m s 	
707
It’s true many problems are solved by experience (someone 
has seen the same problem before). It’s true most problems are 
solved by trial and error (alternatives are tried until something 
works). My difficulty is that process problems that can be solved by 
trial and error or by ordinary experience rarely reach me. They are 
handled by the shift operators or solved by the unit engineers.
It’s the intractable problems that are my domain. The ones caused 
by several malfunctions, all of which have to be corrected before any 
improvement is obtained. It’s the problems that appear to be unre-
lated to any prior plant operating experience.
These sorts of problems I have been able to solve only by insight. 
First, I collect all the field data. Second, I discuss the situation with 
the plant shift operators. Next, I’ll examine tower internal drawings, 
pump curves, and exchanger data sheets. Finally, I’ll perform the 
relevant engineering calculations. This usually does not result in 
reaching a resolution of the problem.
What I must now do is that which I find most difficult. It’s the 
application of intellectual energy and insight.
I have to be alone. Alone and away from telephones. I do best 
when out of the plant, perhaps walking in a park.
I have to accept all the data. I’ll repeat to myself the mantra, “Even 
though you don’t like the data, the data represent reality. The data you 
wish to reject are just a reflection of your lack of intellectual honesty.”
I have to put aside all preconceptions. I have to discard the notion 
that I’ve seen this situation before. Trying to solve a problem based on 
experience creates mental confusion and wastes time.
I have to cast aside my ego. Often I’ve already taken a position in 
some meeting. I hate to admit I’m wrong. I hate to admit that an anal-
ysis by some junior engineer was correct.
Thirty-five years ago a young engineer from Standard Oil of Ohio 
asked me to define a step wise approach to troubleshooting process 
plant problems. Honestly, I didn’t know how to answer her question. 
And I still don’t know. It’s a sense that grows inside me, rather like 
hunger or anger or joy. It’s a sense of growing comprehension. The 
seed of the solution existed in my mind all along. It will grow into 
comprehension given the right environment.
I call this insight, but if you don’t know what I mean, I can’t explain it.
52.7   Afterword
I started work as a process engineer at the long since vanished 
American Oil Refinery in Whiting, Indiana, on November 19, 1965. 
William Duval, my boss, handed me a large, loose-leaf manual entitled 
“Standard Design Practices.” What seemed odd at the time was the 
archaic contents of the manual. Most of the sections were dated 
before World War II, early in the 1930s. The section on knockout 
drum sizing hailed from the mid-1920s.

	
708	
C h a p t e r  F i f t y - T w o
I left my job with American Oil in 1981 and stole their “Standard 
Design Practices” manual. I can see its faded blue binder now. Not in 
my imagination. It’s on my bookshelf with my other reference texts. 
Just feet from where I’m sitting. I use it still when I design process 
equipment and evaluate malfunctions. Including the vapor-liquid 
separation chart from the 1920s.
We work in a stagnant industry. It’s true that vapor-liquid separa-
tion can be greatly improved by the use of vertical vortex tubes, 
which are a relatively new development. Yet most vapor-liquid sepa-
rators are still empty vessels that depend on gravity settling and are 
sized in accordance with Stokes’ Law.
We have distillation trays using “Super-Frac” advanced technol-
ogy. Yet bubble-cap trays, developed in the 1830s, are in widespread 
use, and refiners still rely on sieve trays.
There have been tremendous advances in the design of centrifu-
gal pump mechanical seals, yet many new pumps employ ancient 
rope-type packing to prevent product leakage around the shaft.
Computer control has transformed the design of control systems in 
the process industry. Yet the panel operator must still be trained to run 
the plant manually, using 1920s control loops when the computer con-
trol falters, and even then must also be well practiced at manual control 
under daily normal circumstances in order to cope with plant upsets.
Helical baffles, tube inserts, and twisted tubes are all becoming 
more common in new heat exchangers. Yet 99 percent of the shell-
and-tube heat exchangers Liz and I encounter are of conventional 
design.
So, if process equipment itself has not changed, why this fourth 
edition?
Well, something has changed. I’ve changed. Since Liz and I 
authored the third edition, we have both become smarter. Smarter in 
the sense that we have learned a lot about our misconceptions about 
how process equipment works. Much of our understanding about 
vacuum ejectors, centrifugal compressors, pump mechanical seals, 
and distillation tray hydraulics were not correct. We’re both learning 
all the time. So we must be getting smarter.
Maybe if we keep on learning from our mistakes, Liz and I can get 
smart enough to stop making errors. Wisdom comes with age. As long 
as we both remember that we are not too old to learn, we’ll be okay.
