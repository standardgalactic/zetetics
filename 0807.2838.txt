(Dated: July 17, 2008)
We propose an extension of General Relativity with two different metrics. To each metric we deﬁne a Levi-
Cevita connection and a curvature tensor. We then consider two types of ﬁelds, each of which moves according
to one of the metrics and its connection. To obtain the ﬁeld equations for the second metric we impose an
exchange symmetry on the action. As a consequence of this ansatz, additional source terms for Einstein’s ﬁeld
equations are generated. We discuss the properties of these additional ﬁelds, and consider the examples of the
Schwarzschild solution, and the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker metric.
During the last decades, experimental achievements in as-
trophysics provided us with new insights about our universe.
The more precise our observations have become, the more
obvious also the insufﬁciency of our understanding have be-
come. Today’s research in cosmology is accompanied by the
group of cosmological problems, which strongly indicate that
our knowledge about the universe is incomplete. Most impor-
tantly, it is microscopic explanations for dark matter and dark
energy that we are lacking. A lot of effort has been invested
into studies of ﬁelds with unusual equations of states which
can account for one or the other constituent.
In this paper we propose an extension of General Relativ-
ity with ﬁelds that experience space-time to have a metric h
different from our usual one g. This causes additional source
terms to Einstein’s ﬁeld equations that have properties unlike
those of our standard matter. The new ﬁelds do not move
according to the Levi-Cevita connection, but according to a
non-metric, torsion-free connection derived from the second
metric h. To obtain the equations of motion for the second
metric, we propose a symmetry between both types of matter
and the according metrics.
Different versions of bi-metric theories and their potential
importance to explaining observational evidence have previ-
ously been investigated in [1, 2, 3, 4], and the approaches in
references [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]
study similar symmetry considerations.
This paper is organized as follows: The general setup with
the two metrics and two types of ﬁelds is introduced in section
I. In the section II, we deﬁne the connections, and in section
III we construct the action for the new sort of ﬁelds and cou-
ple it to General Relativity (GR). In section IV we use the
exchange symmetry to obtain the complete set of equations
including those for the second metric, and then investigate the
example of the Schwarzschild solution, and the Friedmann-
Robertson-Walker metric in V and VI. After a discussion of
the scenario and its possible observable consequences in VII,
we conclude in section VIII.
Throughoutthis paper we use the convention c = ¯h = 1. The
signature of the metric is (−1,1,1,1). Small Greek indices are
space-time indices and run from 0 to 3.

I.
A BI-METRIC THEORY
We consider a bi-metric theory with metrics g and h of
Lorentzian signature that deﬁne two different ways of measur-
ing angles, distances and volumes on a manifold M. Changing
from g to h changes the map from the tangential space, TM, to
the co-tangential space, TM∗. Since we then have two ways to
raise and lower indices, we will use a notation with two types
of coordinate-indices so we do not spoil the Ricci-calculus.
For this, we will denote coordinate indices that are raised and
lowered by h with underlines. In case objects do not carry
indices we underline them in total.
We will further introduce two sorts of matter on M: one
that moves according to the usual[22] metric g and the mea-
sure it implies, the other one that moves according to the other
metric h. We will refer to these ﬁelds as g-ﬁelds and h-ﬁelds,
respectively; the equations of motions will be speciﬁed in sec-
tion III. Related, we consider two types of observers on our
spacetime, the one made up of h-ﬁelds who measures with the
metric h, the other one made of g-ﬁelds who measures with
metric g. They will have to set their observations in relation to
each other in a consistent way, much like different observers
in Special Relativity.
Such, we have on the one hand the h-observer who sees a
g-ﬁeld with unusual behavior, and on the other hand the g-
observer who thinks this ﬁeld to be perfectly normal matter.
The same situation applies for g and h exchanged. To take this
into account we will consider a map Ph, which is an automor-
phism on the tensor-bundle, and which maps h-ﬁelds as the
h-observer sees them to h-ﬁelds as the g-observer sees them.
Similarly, we have a map Pg, which maps g-ﬁelds as the g-
observer sees them to g ﬁelds as the h-observer sees them.
These maps conserve the tensor structure of objects, i.e. a
tensor of rank (r,s) is mapped to a tensor of rank (r,s), and
they are linear in the ﬁeld’s components. Most importantly,
they assign a two-tensor hκν to the metric h, which we will
denote by h, and a two-tensor gκν to the metric g, which will
be denoted by g:
g = Pg(g)
,
h = Ph(h)
.

Since these maps are linear, we can write in components

κ hνκ = hνκ

[Pg]ν
ν [Pg]κ
κ gνκ = gνκ
.

We will in the following refer to these maps as ‘pull-overs’.
One has to be careful however when pulling elements over
from the one observer to the other. Since the components of
pulled over tensors are mapped from the tangential into the
cotangential space with a different metric, the notation of the
inverse does no longer match with the use of indices. I.e. the
pull-over P−1
h
of hνκ is not hκνgκεgνλ (where hκν is the pull-
over of hκν) but rather a tensor h−1 with the property that
[h−1]ελhεκ = δλ
κ. We will try to avoid this by not using the
pull-overs as long as not absolutely necessary (and we will
see that we can rather successfully do so).
The introduction of these pull-overs is an assumption. Its
usefulness lies in enabling us to now chose different coordi-
nate systems for the g and h-observer. We could for exam-
ple apply a change of coordinates only on the h metric. This
would imply an according change in the pull-over (a multi-
plication with the inverse of the coordinate transformation),
but it would not make it necessary to also change the coor-
dinate system the g-observer has chosen for his description.
The most obvious choice for the pull-over would just be the
identity. We will however see later that we can not ﬁx these
pull-overs, but that they have to be determined from the ﬁeld
equations, and can not in general be chosen to be the identity.
We further deﬁne a map a that transforms the one metric
into the pull-over of the other
gελ = a ν
ε a κ
λ hνκ
.
(4)
Since both g and h are symmetric, a is not completely deter-
mined by (4). We ﬁx the remaining six degrees of freedom
(dof) by requiring it to be symmetric, i.e. gκνaε
ν = aεκ = aκε.
We can pull over a by
a ν
ε = [Pg]ε
ε a ν
ε

Ph
ν
ν
,
(5)
which then gives the relation
gελ = a ν
ε a κ
λ hνκ
.
(6)
This pulled over quantity is also required to be symmetric. It is
further useful to deﬁne a combination of a and the pull-overs
that maps g to h via
a ν
ε
= a ν
ε [Ph]ν
ν
,
(7)
gελ = a ν
ε a κ
λ hνκ
.
(8)
And by raising and lowering some indices we also have
gελ = a ν
ε aλν , hνκ = aε
νaεκ
.
(9)
In this formulation, the introduced map a is a convenience
and not a dynamical ﬁeld, since it is deﬁned by relating g to
Ph(h). The dynamical quantities are g and h, as well as the
both pull-overs Ph and Pg, and possible additional matter and
gauge ﬁelds. That means for the variation we have to keep a
ﬁxed. We specify the properties of the ﬁeld under variation by
requiring
δaνκ = 0
.
(10)
We will see later that this requirement makes for an interesting
scenario as it results in quite unusual properties of the h-ﬁelds.
One can read this off already from Eq. (4). Demanding (10)
to hold will imply that it is the inverse of the second metric
that behaves under variation like the usual metric. Unlike the
problems that one would run into by just using the inverse
metric as a second metric (because one had to treat a covariant
ﬁeld as a contravariant one) the approach proposed here by
introducing a ﬁeld that only behaves under variation as the
inverse metric, is manifestly covariant.
II.
CONNECTIONS
To g one can deﬁne a Levi-Cevita connection in the usual
way that we will denote as (g)∇. Similarly, one can deﬁne a
Levi-Cevita connection to h, and we will denote this connec-
tion as (h)∇. To both metrics with their connections, one can
construct the curvature tensor, the Ricci tensor, and the curva-
ture scalar, that we will denote as (g)R and (h)R, respectively.
In detail one has
(g)Γε
νκ = gεα(g)Γανκ
,
(11)
(g)Γανκ = 1
2 (∂νgακ +∂κgαν −∂αgνκ)
,
(12)
(h)Γε
νκ = hεα(h)Γανκ
,
(13)
(h)Γανκ = 1
2(∂νhακ +∂κhαν −∂αhνκ)
.
(14)
We can further deﬁne a pulled over derivative for the h-ﬁeld,
which we denote as (h)∇, by requiring it to be a torsion-free
but non-metric connection that preserves h. From (h)∇h = 0
we then ﬁnd the connection coefﬁcients to (h)∇to be
(h)Γε
νκ = 1
2[Ph(h)]εα (∂νhακ +∂κhαν −∂αhνκ)
.
(15)
As mentioned previously, one should keep in mind that
[Ph(h)]εα is not hεα but the inverse of hεκ, and further that
the indices on (h)Γ are lowered and raised with g. From the
above one also ﬁnds for h, the determinant of hνκ,
∂κh = 2h(h)Γν
νκ
.
(16)
One can do a similar construction to pull over (g)∇to obtain
a derivative (g)∇, which is not metric with respect to h but
preserves g, i.e. (g)∇g = 0. This construction of derivatives
now puts a further requirement on the pull-overs because they
have to be compatible with the tensor structure. So, for an
arbitrary tensor A we then have
Ph((h)∇A) =
(h)∇Ph(A)
,
(17)
Pg((g)∇A) =
(g)∇Pg(A)
.
(18)
In components we had e.g. for Aλ
κε
[Ph((h)∇νAλ
κε)]λ
νκε = (h)∇ν[Ph(Aλ
κε)]λ
κε
.
(19)

Since both connections as well as their pull-overs have to
be torsion free, this implies the pull-overs have to be inte-
grable and are generated by two vector ﬁelds v and w such that
[Pg]ν
κ ≡W ν
κ = ∂κwν, and [Ph]ν
κ ≡V ν
κ = ∂κvν. The pull-overs
thus carry four dof each, after requiring them to be torsion free
and metric-compatible in the above described fashion.
However, we will for the variation not assume these re-
quirements are already fulﬁlled, as this is in conﬂict with the
dof we need. As explained previously, the independent vari-
ables are g and h, each of which has ten dof. Since the a’s
and a’s do not carry degrees of freedom, the pull-overs need
to carry these ten dof since a conjunction of both, the a’s and
the pull-overs, relates g to h, as can be read off from Eq. (8).
Therefore, prior to the variation we can only assume the con-
nections are torsion free, and take into account metric compat-
ibility after the variation. For the usual connections, the vari-
ation over the connection together with the torsion-free-ness
implies metric compatibility as usual. For the additional con-
nections, we will here not explicitly add a term to the action
to generate it but subsequently assume metric-compatibility
since it seems to be a desirable feature (though the scenario
could be considered in more generality).
To summarize this section: Each metric deﬁnes its own
Levi-Cevita connection, and after pulling them over these in-
duce two non-metric connections, which will describe the mo-
tion the g-observer assigns to the h-ﬁelds and vice versa.
III.
AND ACTION
Now let us add some physics. Consider we have an h-ﬁeld
that behaves not according to the usual Levi-Cevita connec-
tion, but according to the connection metric with respect to h,
a ﬁeld that feels angles and distances as deﬁned by h not g.
For a massless scalar h-ﬁeld φ the action that gives the equa-
tions of motions as the g-observer sees them could look like
S =
Z
d4x
√
−h Ph

hνκ (h)∇κφ(h)∇νφ

,
(20)
where h = det(Ph(h)) so we have pulled over the determinant
and the measure is appropriately invariant.
For a scalar ﬁeld the covariant derivative is of course just
the partial one so it does not matter according to which met-
ric the connection is metric, but in general this will not be the
case. One can construct Lagrangians L for other types of h-
ﬁelds than scalars in a similar way by replacing the usual met-
ric with the other one, and the usual Levi-Cevita connection
with the one belonging to the other metric, and then pulling
over. If it was just to make a scalar, one could consider the
density weight to be √−g. However, the relevance of putting
√
−h instead becomes apparent when one takes the variation
over the ﬁeld and its connection to obtain the equations of mo-
tion (eom). In order to convert the pull-over of a term (h)∇νAν
into a total derivative the prefactor needs to be
√
−h not √−g,
so it is compatible with the derivation used in the Lagrangian.
For such a term then to vanish one uses equation (16), which
guarantees the validity of Gauss’s law. The resulting eom are
then just
Ph

(h)∇α(h)∇αφ

= 0
,
(21)
which is by deﬁnition of the pull-over identical to
(h)∇α(h)∇αPh(φ) = 0
.
(22)
Since the pull-over is invertible, the eom (21) are also equiva-
lent to
(h)∇α(h)∇αφ = 0
,
(23)
which are the eom the h-observer would expect. Now we add
such a ﬁeld to GR:
S =

Upon variation, the ﬁrst two terms give just the standard, and
the last term yields

(25)
which we have to rewrite into a variation over gκν so we can
add the terms. We vary (see also Appendix A)

and rewrite into
δhκλ = −[a−1]µ

λδgµν

(27)
where a−1 is the inverse of a
[a−1] κ

ν = δ κ

(28)
We put in some pull-overs and their inverse, and rewrite into
a κ

all terms together and obtain from the variation (see Appendix
A) of the action the equations

where the last line is only to clarify how the rewriting of the
variation from h to h comes into play.
This change of sign we see appearing here in equation (27)
does occur only for the gravitational stress-energy-tensor, i.e.

4
the source term to Einstein’s ﬁeld equations since it is a con-
sequence of taking the variation with respect to the metric. It
does not occur if one derives the kinetic energy momentum
tensor (via Noether’s theorem), neither does the Lagrangian
have a negative kinetic energy term. Since then the sum as
well as the difference of both stress-energy-tensors is con-
served, this means they are separately conserved; both ﬁelds
interact only gravitationally. Thus, despite the presence of
negative gravitational masses, there is no vacuum instability
because the kinetic energy of both sorts of ﬁelds remains pos-
itive, is conserved as usual, and a pair production of negative
and positive gravitational masses out of vacuum is not possi-
ble.
IV.
WITH EXCHANGE SYMMETRY
In the previous section we have only considered the per-
spective of the g-observer and the ﬁeld equations for the g
metric. We have however used that the ﬁelds g and h are not
independent. For symmetry reasons, the independent vari-
ables should be g and h, as well as the two pull-overs, with
which we further obtain g and h via (1). h is then however
related to g via eq. (4), and g to h via eq. (6).
Based on this consideration, we add matter ﬁelds to GR: a
g-ﬁeld ψ, and an h-ﬁeld φ, and request the action be symmetric
under exchange of g with h, and exchange of g-ﬁelds with h-
ﬁelds. This way we obtain

(32)
where the ﬁrst two terms are varied with respect to g using
eq. (4) as done in the previous section, the last two terms with
respect to h using eq. (6), and one should keep in mind that
h = det(Ph(h)) ̸= h and g = det(Pg(g)) ̸= g. The eom for the
matter ﬁelds are the usual ones and their pull-overs, and the
missing ﬁeld equations for the second metric take the form
(h)Rνκ −1
2hνκ(h)R = 8πG

T νκ −


, (33)
with the previously deﬁned stress-energy tensors from eqs.
(30) and (31). Since equation (29) contains h rather than h
and equation (33) contains g rather than g, the pull-overs are
necessary ingredients. We can make this more apparent by
explicitly putting them into the equations:
(g)Rκν −1
2gκν(g)R = Tκν −V
s
h
ga ν
ν a κ
κ T νκ
(34)
(h)Rνκ −1
2hνκ(h)R = T νκ −W
rg
haκ
κaν
νTκν
,
(35)
where V is the determinant of Ph, and W is the determinant of
Pg. (Or, to be more precise their absolute values since the vol-
ume element is positive.) Note that these equations would not
be invariant under coordinate transformations for each of the
observers separately without the pull-overs, since the factor
h/g was not an invariant in this case.
The virtue of doing this is that we can now chose the coordi-
nate systems for g and h separately which seems to be natural.
For example, there is no reason to expect that the coordinate
system that one observer would consider ‘free-falling’ will
agree with the other one’s, since they both move according to
different connections. Thus it will not in general be clear what
a gauge condition on the one metric does to the other one, and
it seems more useful to export this lack of knowledge into the
pull-overs.
The ﬁeld equations (34) and (35) need to fulﬁll the con-
tracted Bianchi identities with respect to the matching Levi-
Cevita connection. Since the stress-energy tensor of the g-
ﬁeld is already covariantly conserved with respect to (g)∇,
and the stress-energy tensor of the g-ﬁeld is similarly covari-
antly conserved with respect to (h)∇, this leaves us with each
four equations for the additional source terms constituted of
the ﬁelds behaving with respect to the non-metric connection.
After assuming metric-compatibility of the pulled-over con-
nections as explained in section II, these each four equations
constrain the remaining four dof in the pull-overs that appear
in these terms.
One should note however that the pull-overs will need addi-
tional initial conditions, and unless one imposes further sym-
metry requirements esp. their determinants can be multiplied
by an arbitrary constant. One can also interpret this as there
a priori being no way of telling whether the coupling between
the two types of ﬁelds and gravity is equally strong or has an
additional pre-factor. However, instead of introducing addi-
tional coupling constants we will leave the constants in the
pull-overs and treat them as parameters of the model that, ide-
ally, have to be determined by observational constraints. Eqs.
(34) reduce to the standard ﬁeld equations in the limit where
the energy density of the h-ﬁelds is very small and/or the de-
terminant of the pull-over is small such that the coupling is
very weak.
To summarize this section: We have 10 components for
each g and h. Equations (34) and (35) provide each 10 equa-
tions that are related by the (contracted) Bianchi identities.
These two times 4 equations ﬁx the two times 4 degrees of
freedom left in Pg and Ph after requiring metric-compatibility
of the pulled-over connections, which leaves us as usual with
4 degrees of freedom to chose the coordinate systems for each
metric.
V.
EXAMPLE I: THE SCHWARZSCHILD METRIC
To obtain a better understanding of the workings, we con-
sider the case with T ≡0, and with only a spherically symmet-
ric source of usual g-ﬁelds outside of which there is vacuum
and we thus have the Schwarzschild solution for g. This so-
lution has one free constant, M, that is the integral over the
energy density of the source. Making the obvious ansatz of
spherical symmetry for h in the same coordinate system, we
ﬁnd also a Schwarzschild solution with one free constant to

5
be ﬁxed by integrating over the source term, and the pull-over
can be set to be constant. Since g/h = 1 , we see that the
integrational constant is just −McW < 0, where cW is the de-
terminant of the pull-over. A further symmetry requirement
that the asymptotic limit of h be just the Minkowski metric η,
as is that of h and g, ﬁxes the pull-over to be the identity and
cW = 1. We then have
gtt = −

1 −2M

gθθ = r2 , gφφ = r2 sin2 θ


, hrr = −1/htt ,
hθθ = r2 , hφφ = r2 sin2 θ
,
(37)
and hκν = hκν.
One can now compute the connection coefﬁcients accord-
ing to eq.
(15) and obtain the geodesic equations for an
h-ﬁeld in this background of a g-source. Since h is just a
Schwarzschild metric with a negative source one sees e.g. by
taking the Newtonian limit that an h-particle will be repelled
by the g-source. It should be emphasized that in the here pre-
sented approach this does not result in contradictions as those
pointed out by Bondi [5] since the h-ﬁelds do move according
to a different connection and thus the equivalence principle
does not apply (see also Appendix B).
In case the radius of the matter source fell below its
Schwarzschild radius, and we had a black hole geometry for
g, the metric h would not have a horizon (the h-ﬁelds are re-
pelled by the source). Note also that this evident symmetry of
the above metrics is not as obvious in every coordinate sys-
tem. For example changing to one of the more well-behaved
systems with e.g. in/out-going EF-coordinates will be a nice
transformation for the usual metric g, but completely mess up
the other metric h. The reason is just that for the h-observer
in/out-going means something different.
As this example shows, the bi-metric model is not causal
in the sense that the h-ﬁeld’s propagation does not need to lie
within the lightcone of the standard ﬁelds. The h-metric on
the manifold thus describes a global causal structure that in
general will be different from that of the g-matter. Because of
the symmetry between both however, the h-ﬁeld’s propagation
is causal as well if the properties of a curve’s tangent vector
are deﬁned through the respective metric. Physically, there
are then two ways to form closed timelike curves: The one is
through an interaction between both types of matter which to-
gether could carry information around a closed timelike curve.
Since the interaction between both types of matter is mediated
only by gravity and very weak, this would be relevant only for
curves going through regions where the gravitational interac-
tion is strong. The other possibility is through a space-time
structure that allows closed timelike curves, which is known to
be possible in the presence of negative energy densities [19],
even for only small amounts [20]. It remains an open ques-
tion though whether these solutions actually describe natural
settings.
It is further worthwhile to point out that the analysis
about stability of the negative mass Schwarzschild black hole
worked out in [21] does not apply to the here discussed case,
since a perturbation of the metric h is related to that of the
usual metric g via the ﬁeld equations. Since g is stable as
usual, there is no reason to expect any instabilities for the met-
ric that the h-observer would measure.
Both types of ﬁelds only interact gravitationally, so the h-
ﬁelds constitute a kind of very weakly interacting dark matter.
Since both kinds of matter repel, one would expect the amount
of h-matter in our vicinity to presently be very small.

We have the usual Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW)

where k = −1,0,+1. To preserve the symmetry of the FRW
metric, we further expect the pull-overs to only act on the time
coordinate and we have a2/(1 −kr) = [Pg(g)]rr and b2/(1 −
kr) = [Ph(h)]rr. For the sources, we use the notation

Since the pull-overs here act only on the time-coordinate, the
solutions for a and b together with the determinants V and
W then give h and g. For example if one wanted to compute
the equation of motion for an h-photon, one had htt = −W2
and hrr = b2/(1 −kr) with which one obtains the non-metric
connection via eqs. (15).
We will in this present work not attempt to discuss the solu-
tions of these equations in all generality, but instead we con-
sider some speciﬁc cases of interest. In the following, cV and
cW are positive valued constants.

1. In case ρ = 0, W does not appear in the equations. If ρ
is a matter ﬁeld, i.e. p = 0, then V = cV is a solution; if
ρ is a radiation ﬁeld, i.e. ρ = 1/3p, then V = cVa/b is
a solution. In this case the V could be absorbed into the
metrics (e.g. by changing both into comoving coordi-
nates). One should note that with this choice of sources
eq. (43) does not have a solution for k = 0,1. The case
for ρ = 0 is similar.
2. If both ρ and ρ are matter ﬁelds then V = cV , W = cW
is a solution.
3. If both ρ and ρ are radiation ﬁelds then V = cV , W = cW
is also a solution.
4. If ρ is a matter ﬁeld and ρ is a radiation ﬁeld then W =
cWb/a and V = cV. Similarly, if ρ is a matter ﬁeld and
ρ is a radiation ﬁeld then V = cVa/b and W = cW. In
these cases, it is not possible to set both W and V to be
constant.
5. If both sources are cosmological constants we have
W = cW(b/a)3 and V = cV (a/b)3. Note that for certain
values of the constants cW and cV the curvature needs
to be negative.
As previously mentioned, the pull-overs are only determined
up to constants that have to be speciﬁed in the initial con-
ditions. With a suitable choice of these constants, one can
achieve the additional source term to be negligible. Though
this scenario does not seem particularly compelling, we want
to point out that for this reason it is possible to reproduce stan-
dard GR up to small corrections.
VII.
CONSEQUENCES AND POSSIBLE OBSERVABLES
In the previous sections we have studied an extension of
GR in whose framework sources with negative gravitational
energy appear in the ﬁeld equations. These additional h-ﬁelds
interact only gravitationally with our standard matter, and thus
couple only extremely weakly. In this section we want to men-
tion some reasons why this scenario is interesting and worth
further examination.
The model we laid out is purely classical. Nevertheless it
is worthwhile to consider the vacuum expectation value of the
stress-energy tensor for quantum ﬁelds that are coupled to the
classical background. We will assume that the ﬁeld content
for both, the g-ﬁelds and the h-ﬁelds, is identical such that we
have e.g. two copies of the Standard Model. The vacuum ex-
pectation value of these quantum ﬁelds is just proportional to
the respective metric. Though the constant of proportionality
is technically seen divergent, one expects this vacuum energy
to be regularized at the Planck scale mp. This leads one to
the well known problem that this vacuum energy density is
∼m4
p, and far too large to ever allow our universe to form the
structures we observe.
If we consider the vacuum solution in the model with ex-
change symmetry however, we expect a symmetry between
both metrics. In the case with the maximal number of space-
time symmetries, both would just be the Minkowski metric.
We then have h/g = 1, and the pull-overs are just the iden-
tity. Since the matter content of both types of ﬁelds is identi-
cal, this means the source terms in eqs. (34) and (35) cancel
identically, no matter how large their values are. This is a
consequence of the additional symmetry. Whether or not this
solution is stable or would run away if the constants did not
exactly cancel requires further investigation. Needless to say,
the measured value of the cosmological constant is not zero,
but at least it is closer to zero than to m4
p.
This bring us to another point to be mentioned, namely the
extraction of observables from the data, e.g. the high-redshift
supernovae data or the WMAP results. Underlying the data
analysis to obtain constraints on the parameters in the ΛCDM-
model is the usual GR formalism. Unfortunately, some parts
of this formalism can not be applied in the model discussed
here. For example, to use cosmological perturbation theory a
relevant parameter is the relative size of perturbations δρ/ρ.
Typically, one infers from the CMB measurements the per-
turbations at freeze-out were small ≈10−5. This however
is the size of perturbations relative to the observable (usual)
matter density. Since we now have an only gravitationally in-
teracting density contribution that is negative, and one further
would hope for symmetry reasons that both densities are of
the same order of magnitude, the total gravitating density can
be smaller than the observed one. Then, the relative density
ﬂuctuations could be larger. Besides this, both components of
matter repel each other which is an effect usually not present.
Another feature of the scenario becomes clear from the pre-
viously discussed example of the Schwarzschild metric. If
there was a localized source of negative energy, it would act
as a gravitational lens - but unlike usual matter this would be a
diverging lens since it would repel our (usual) photons. Such
a lensing event would typically lower the luminosity of the
source, an effect that could potentially add up over distance if
the distribution of such sources is substantial. The detection
of a diffractive lensing event could serve as a smoking gun
signal for the here proposed scenario.

SUMMARY
We have studied an extension of General Relativity with
two metrics, and two sorts of ﬁelds. Each ﬁeld moves accord-
ing to the Levi-Cevita connection of one of the metrics. The
new sort of ﬁelds only interacts gravitationally with our usual
matter. We have coupled these ﬁelds to General Relativity.
By requiring the action to be symmetric under exchange of
the two metrics, and their ﬁelds, we obtained a model from
which we could derive the equations of motions for the two
sorts of ﬁelds, as well as the ﬁeld equations for both metrics.
It turned out that the additional ﬁelds can make a contribution
to the gravitational stress-energy tensor with a negative energy
density. We argued that this does not imply a vacuum insta-
bility since the kinetic energies are still strictly positive and
conserved. We further investigated the spherical symmetric
example with a source of usual matter, and we found that the

7
newly introduced particles would be repelled by this source.
We also derived the Friedmann-equations within this scenario
and discussed some general properties of possible solutions.
Finally, we mentioned some possible consequences for ob-
servables, most importantly a diffractive gravitational lensing
effect.
We hope to have shown that the here proposed bi-metric
model with exchange symmetry has interesting properties,
and that it can potentially shed light on some so far unresolved
questions in cosmology and astrophysics.

Taking the variation with use of (10) one obtains

Since aκν is symmetric, so is [a−1]κν and we also have

We then use (53) to bring the a’s in (50) to the other side

If we consider pulling over one of the indices on a−1 with use

By putting in a pull-over for the index α and its inverse, and
absorbing the pull-overs in the deﬁnition (7) and (8) we get

The pull-overs are linear, so we have

Note that this is not a performance of the variation, but a
rewriting of the derivative with the aim to express the varia-
tion of L in a way that the symmetry becomes more apparent.
We could leave this term in the initial form where variation
is with respect to hνκ but we want to make use of the fact
that the form of L is symmetric to the usual Lagrangian un-
der exchange of gκν with hκν (not hκν) and exchange of the
respective covariant derivatives.
With Eq.(54) and (56) and we then obtain

Appendix B
If it wasn’t the case that a negative mass particle moved ac-
cording to a different covariant derivative, one could construct
the following problem with negative sources in General Rel-
ativity: Gravity is a spin-two ﬁeld. Thus, like charges attract
and unlike charges repel, and a negative mass particle should
be repelled by a positive mass source. On the other hand, the
negative mass particle moves according to the geodesic equa-
tion which does not know anything about the particle’s mass -
it only knows about the positive source background. Thus, the
negative mass particle should be attracted to the source as all
test particles. One would then be lead to conclude a negative
mass test particle was attracted and repelled likewise which
can be used to construct all kinds of nonsense.
The reason for this confusion is that the use of the usual
geodesic equation for the negative mass particle is inappropri-
ate which one can understand most easily by interpreting the
covariant derivative as a coupling to the gravitational ﬁeld that
conserves the total energy of the particle including the poten-
tial energy. For a negative mass test particle that is repelled
instead of attracted, the conservation law has to be different
since it couples differently to the background. This is similar
to the coupling of electrons and positrons to the electric ﬁeld
being mediated by different covariant derivatives.
