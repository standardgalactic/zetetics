Ideophones, also termed “mimetics” or “expressives,” are marked words that depict sensory imagery. 
They are found in many of the world’s languages, and sizable lexical classes of ideophones are 
particularly well-documented in languages of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. Ideophones are not 
limited to onomatopoeia like meow and smack, but cover a wide range of sensory domains, such as 
manner of motion (e.g., plisti plasta ‘splish-splash’ in Basque), texture (e.g., tsaklii ‘rough’ in Ewe), 
and psychological states (e.g., wakuwaku ‘excited’ in Japanese). Across languages, ideophones stand 
out as marked words due to special phonotactics, expressive morphology including certain types of 
reduplication, and relative syntactic independence, in addition to production features like prosodic 
foregrounding and common co-occurrence with iconic gestures. 
Three intertwined issues have been repeatedly debated in the century-long literature on 
ideophones. (a) Definition: Isolated descriptive traditions and cross-linguistic variation have 
sometimes obscured a typologically unified view of ideophones, but recent advances show the 
promise of a prototype definition of ideophones as conventionalised depictions in speech, with room 
for language-specific nuances. (b) Integration: The variable integration of ideophones across 
linguistic levels reveals an interaction between expressiveness and grammatical integration, and has 
important implications for how to conceive of dependencies between linguistic systems. (c) 
Iconicity: Ideophones form a natural laboratory for the study of iconic form-meaning associations in 
natural languages, and converging evidence from corpus and experimental studies suggests 
important developmental, evolutionary, and communicative advantages of ideophones.

1. Definition 
Ideophones are marked words that evoke vivid sensory scenes in imitative fashion. They are 
abundant in language families across the globe, such as Bantu, Austroasiatic, Dravidian, and 
Quechuan, as well as Basque, Japanese, and Korean. Some examples are cited in Table 1. 
Although sound imitatives like boom and splash have been known in Western linguistics from 
early on, it was only when linguists began to describe a wider range of languages that a larger class 
of imitative words came to light (cf. Vidal, 1852 on Yorùbá; Aston, 1894 on Japanese; Urtel, 1919 
on Basque). As the term ONOMATOPOEIA by that time had acquired derogatory connotations 
(Moore, 2015) and was mostly understood to be limited to sound imitatives, many scholars 
invented new terms for this larger class, from “specific adverbs” to Lautbilder (‘sound images’) and 
from “echoisms” to mots expressifs (‘expressive words’). The new term that caught on most widely 
was IDEOPHONES, introduced by Doke (1935). Today, this is the term used for lexical classes of 
imitative words in languages across the globe, from Basque to Zulu and from Korean to Quechua. 
Two other terms – mimetics in Japanese linguistics and expressives in South and Southeast Asian 
linguistics – are regarded as largely equivalent, and we use ‘ideophones’ as a cover term to include 
these variants.

Table 1. Ideophones across languages (adapted from Dingemanse, 2012, p. 661) 
 
Doke was one of the first to insist that, at least in Bantu languages, ideophones formed a 
lexical class on a par with more widely used categories like noun and verb. He defined 
“ideophone” as follows: 
(1) A vivid representation of an idea in sound. A word, often onomatopoeic, which describes a 
predicate, qualificative or adverb in respect to manner, colour, sound, smell, action, state or 
intensity. … It must be pointed out that generally the special rules of length, tone and stress, 
applicable in ordinary grammatical forms, differ considerably in the case of ideophones. (Doke, 
1935, pp. 118–119) 
Although Doke’s definition was intended for use in grammars of Bantu languages, many of its 
elements have been found to be relevant across languages, and make their appearance in later 
cross-linguistic characterisations (Samarin, 1965; Diffloth, 1972; Childs, 1994), including the 
definition of ideophones we will adopt here: “marked words that depict sensory imagery” 
(Dingemanse, 2012). 
1.1. Markedness 
One of the most striking properties of ideophones is their formal markedness at different levels of 
linguistic structure, chief among them phonology (Diffloth, 1979; Childs, 1988; Klamer, 2002; 
Kruspe, 2004, among others). Onomatopoeia have long been known as words whose iconicity 
allows them to violate regular phonotactic rules, as in the marked onset of English vroom ‘sound 
of an engine’ and coda of buzz ‘sound of bees flying’ (for a discussion of iconicity in ideophones, 

Oxford Research Encyclopedia of Linguistics

see Section 3). Likewise, many ideophones in Hausa have consonant-final structure (e.g., tsít ‘in a 
complete silence, hush’ tsúlúm ‘sound of a small object falling in water’, kàzàʀ-kázáʀ ‘in an 
energetic manner’) whereas most regular Hausa words end in a vowel (Newman, 2001, p. 252). 
The phoneme /p/ in Japanese is prevalent in ideophones (e.g., petapeta ‘slapping’) but absent in 
prosaic native words, another example of how ideophones can deviate from regular phonology 
(Hamano, 1998).  
Other aspects of the formal composition of ideophones also show their markedness. Many 
ideophones show feature harmony for vowels, tone or nasalisation (Kwon, 2018). Relatedly, 
ideophones in many languages show nonconcatenative or templatic morphology, with groups of 
ideophones forming small clusters of similar forms with similar meanings (McCarthy, 1983; 
McFarland, 2010; Tufvesson, 2011). Ideophones are also marked in the degree to which they are 
susceptible to playful processes of word formation like expressive lengthening and reduplicative 
morphology (Zwicky & Pullum, 1987). Thus, reduplication is common in ideophones, where it 
tends to express iterative aspect (e.g., curukcuruk-nu ‘many sharp pricks’ in Tamil, Dravidian; 
Gasser, Sethuraman, & Hockema, 2010) or intensification (e.g., Japanese kutakuta ‘exhausted’). 
The syntactic distribution of ideophones tends to be marked as well: ideophones predominantly 
appear in affirmative-declarative sentences, even resisting negation in some languages (Diffloth, 
1972 on Semai, Austroasiatic; Childs, 1994 on Kisi, Niger-Congo). However, this type of 
restriction appears to be weakened when ideophones are grammatically integrated with prosaic 
language (Newman, 1968 on Hausa, Afro-Asiatic; Dhoorre & Tosco, 1998 on Somali, Afro-
Asiatic; see Section 2). 
1.2. Depiction 
The vivid meanings of ideophones have been described in terms of a separate representational 
mode of meaning: an “expressive” or “affecto-imagistic” dimension (Diffloth, 1972; Kita, 1997). 
In this semantic dimension, “language has direct contact with sensory, motor, and affective 
information” (Kita, 1997, p. 380). The special mode of representation of ideophones can be 
further explicated by drawing on the semiotic distinction between “depiction” and “description” 
(Clark & Gerrig, 1990; Güldemann, 2008; Ferrara & Hodge, 2018). To say that ideophones are 
depictions is to say that like images or manual gestures, “they show rather than tell, they perform 
rather than merely inform” (Dingemanse & Akita, 2017, p. 505). So bìlbàlà in (2) invites the 
hearer to simulate the depicted experience and “hear” the sound of the log rolling down noisily as 
if s/he were in the reported world (see also Nuckolls, 1996).

(emphasis throughout this article is ours) 
This semiotic characteristic makes ideophones distinct from interjections, such as ah and ouch, 
which may also have marked forms and index sensory experiences but are typically responsive 
rather than depictive. Depictions – from pictures to gestures, and from quotations to ideophones 
– are characterised by iconic form-meaning mappings and gradient use of material, where changes 
in form analogously correspond to changes in meaning. Descriptions on the other hand are 
characterised by arbitrary form-meaning mappings and discrete building blocks, as in the 
phonemes or letters that form prosaic words. Seeing ideophones as depictions helps explain their 
iconicity and gradient formal features. In this semiotic model, ideophones are understood as

Ideophones (Mimetics, Expressives) 
 
lexicalised depictions of sensory imagery in speech. 
While marked forms and depictive features are typical of ideophones as a lexical class, they are 
best seen as prototypical features rather than as necessary and sufficient properties (Childs, 1994; 
Akita, 2009; Dingemanse, 2012). For example, many onomatopoeic ideophones in English, such 
as crash and plop, are morphophonologically indistinguishable from prosaic words. Moreover, 
reduplication is a productive morphological operation in both ideophonic and prosaic lexicons of 
some languages (Mattes, 2007, 2018). Furthermore, some words may be considered more 
ideophonic than others, as illustrated by the Japanese ideophone chokichoki ‘snipping repeatedly’ 
and its related but more prosaic-like form chokkiri ‘exact’ (Akita, 2009). Because of the fuzzy and 
heterogeneous nature of the ideophone category, it has been common to view it as a prototype 
category, making it similar to major lexical categories such as the verb and noun (Dryer, 1997; 
Croft, 2001; Haspelmath, 2007). The next section takes a closer look at the way ideophones and 
prosaic words coexist in the linguistic system, another longstanding issue in the literature. 
2. Integration 
2.1. Phonological and morphological integration 
The markedness of ideophones as a class is often seen as one of their most noteworthy features. 
This sometimes leads to the misconception that ideophones are completely unlike other words, 
insulated from the prosaic linguistic system (as pointed out by Newman, 2001). In reality, even if 
ideophones are marked in several ways, they are still constructed mostly out of the same phonemic 
building blocks as prosaic words. This is because, in Tucker Childs’ memorable formulation, they 
have to “reconcile the twin dicta of ‘Be different’ and ‘Be recognizably language’” (Childs, 2014). 
This dual nature has implications for theories of phonological and lexical structure. 
A first sign of the linguistic status of ideophones is that their phonological buildup, while 
marked in several ways, usually bears a transparent relation to the broader phonological system. 
For instance, in the (relatively rare) cases where they feature speech sounds that are marginal in 
prosaic words, these sounds tend to fill gaps in the system. Japanese /p/, found in the ideophonic 
part of the native lexicon, fills what would otherwise be a gap in a system that has regular voicing 
alternations in the alveolar and velar obstruent series (Itô & Mester, 1995). Likewise, Iroquioan 
phonology lacks a labial stop series, but ideophonic words fill this gap, featuring /p/ and /b/ 
(Mithun, 1982). In other cases, ideophones may show phoneme distributions that are more 
restricted than in other words. Hindi has 21 vowel phonemes, but only three of them (/a, i, u/) 
occur in prototypical ideophones (Kellersmann, 2017). In Korean, ideophones feature stem-
internal vowel harmony, which does not occur in prosaic words (Kwon, 2018).  
To capture these facts about the phonology of ideophones, it is not sufficient to stress their 
deviance. Instead, the phonology of ideophones is best seen as a transformation of the phonology 
of prosaic words. In a detailed study of Pastaza Quichua by Nuckolls and colleagues, the 
phonology of ideophones is described as a “stretched” and “contracted” relative to other words 
(Nuckolls, Nielsen, Stanley, & Hopper, 2016). According to one influential proposal, these 
transformations are sufficiently systematic to speak of an expressive phonology distinct but related 
from prosaic phonology: a system “where the structural elements necessary for prosaic language 
are deliberately re-arranged and exploited for their iconic properties, and used for aesthetic 
communication” (Diffloth, 1979, p. 58).  
In morphology likewise, ideophones waver between markedness and integration depending on 
how and where we look. They do not partake in many regular morphological processes, which is 
one reason for their definition as strings directly mappings phonology to semantics “without

passing through the morphological component of the grammar” (Johnson, 1976, p. 241). Instead 
they are particularly susceptible to playful word formation processes like lengthening and 
reduplication, dubbed “expressive morphology” in analogy to Diffloth’s expressive phonology 
(Zwicky & Pullum, 1987). Here, too, we may explain the pattern by reference to origin of 
ideophones as iconic forms, using speech material in a more fluid and gradient way than prosaic 
words.  
This does not mean that ideophones are entirely insulated from more prosaic parts of the 
vocabulary. Indeed reduplication can function as a bridge between the two. In Siwu, some 
reduplicated ideophones are related to verb roots (e.g., bɛ V ‘be wide’ ↔ bɛbɛɛbɛ IDPH ‘wide’, mini 
V ‘encircle’ ↔ minimini IDPH ‘circular’). Japanese has quite a few verbs with putative ideophonic 
origin (Hamano, 1998): 
(3) 
Deideophonised verbs in Japanese: 
 
a. zawa-tsuk(-u) ‘murmur’ (< zawazawa ‘a crowd murmuring’) 
 
b. koro-gar(-u) ‘roll’ (< korokoro ‘a light object rolling continuously’) 
 
c. hika-r(-u) ‘shine’ (< pikapika ‘shining brightly’) 
 
d. sawa-g(-u) ‘make noise’ (< zawazawa ‘a crowd murmuring’) 
None of these verbs retain the reduplicated morphology of the input ideophones. Native speakers 
of Japanese are unlikely to recognise the ideophonic origin of the verbs in (3c–d), whose initial 
consonants have been changed to conform to prosaic phonology. [p] and voiced obstruents cannot 
stand in the initial position of prosaic native words in Japanese except for limited registers 
(Hamano, 1998). Such “deideophonisation,” in which ideophones are integrated into the prosaic 
lexicon at the expense of their prototypical ideophonic properties, is a common phenomenon 
across ideophone-rich languages (Tamori & Schourup, 1999; Childs, 2001). 
Deideophonisation is also common at the semantic level. Some languages have (quasi-) 
ideophonic items whose meanings are as abstract as intensifiers and are used with a broad range of 
predicates. For example, the Ewe ideophones gbagbã ‘on the point of overflowing (of a pot)’ and 
(k)peŋ(k)peŋ ‘blows resounding’ appear to be the sources of the reduplicated adverbials gbagbagba 
‘very much, with emphasis’ and pémpem ‘very, completely’ (Bartens, 2000, p. 29; Ameka, 2001). 
2.2. Morphosyntactic integration 
In many languages, ideophones tend to be found at the edge of an utterance or even as 
independent utterances, as in (4) as well as (2) above, which made Kunene (1965) describe them 
as syntactically “aloof”. 
(4) 
Wirr inggirr. 
IDPH pulled.out 
‘Wirr! [He] pulled [it] out.’ (Yir-Yoront, Paman; Alpher, 2001, p. 20) 
Although some degree of syntactic independence is the rule for most ideophones in most 
languages, the syntactic behaviour of ideophones is more varied than examples like the above 
suggest. Many languages feature multiple morphosyntactic constructions for ideophones, and one 
and the same ideophone may occur in different constructions.  
One grammatical context for ideophones found in many languages is a quotative construction 
(Güldemann, 2008; Akita & Usuki, 2016), as in (5). This kind of construction has the potential 
to bridge the semiotic gap between ideophones and more prosaic forms of speech.

In many languages, light or dummy verb constructions further incorporate ideophones into 
the sentence structure, as in (6) (Langdon, 1994; Schaefer & Egbokhare, 2002; Franco, 2017). 
One may also analyse (5a) as a light verb construction.

The specific set of constructions available to ideophones – and the relative degree of 
morphosyntactic integration associated with it – differs from language to language, and as a result, 
the grammatical-categorial status of ideophones has been actively debated for half a century, often 
in relation to the definitional issues described in Section 1 (Newman, 1968; Samarin, 1971; 
Bartens, 2000). Although many ideophones in many languages are adverbial (Watson, 2001), 
Somali ideophones are nominal (Afro-Asiatic; Dhoorre & Tosco, 1998), and Cantonese has many 
adjectival ideophones (Sino-Tibetan; Bodomo, 2006). It remains to be elucidated what 
determines the morphosyntactic potential of ideophones in each language and how this relates to 
broader issues in syntactic typology. 
Compared to other words, ideophones typically exhibit a high degree of expressiveness as 
measured in terms of intonational foregrounding, special types of phonation, and expressive 
morphology (Childs, 1994; Nuckolls, 1996). However, as the examples above show, they may 
vary considerably in terms of grammatical integration. Recent research suggests an inverse relation 
between expressiveness and morphosyntactic integration: higher expressiveness goes together with 
lower integration and vice versa (Dingemanse & Akita, 2017). The dynamic is illustrated in (7), 
taken from the NHK East Japan Great Earthquake archives, a multimodal corpus of spoken 
Japanese. The first two ideophone tokens – both gitchiri ‘tightly’ – function as adverbs and are 
pronounced with intonational foregrounding, i.e. a pitch that is distinctly higher than the 
surrounding material (marked ↑…↑). Both instances are accompanied by a hand gesture 
(marked [G …]) that demonstrates the holding action. On the other hand, such paralinguistic and 
nonverbal features are not found with two ideophonic items that are more deeply embedded in 
the morphosyntactic structure of the utterance: the predicative ideophone bikkuri-shi ‘be 
surprised’ and the event-general, deideophonised adverb yukkuri ‘slowly’.

“Excuse me,” the person was surprised …’ 
(http://www9.nhk.or.jp/archives/311shogen/detail/#dasID=D0007010111_00000) 
The inverse relation between expressiveness and morphosyntactic integration turns out to be a 
feature of ideophones across a wide range of languages. Besides the ten languages identified as 
showing an interaction like this (Dingemanse & Akita, 2017 – the main source of Table 2 below), 
further work has replicated the finding in Basque (Ibarretxe-Antuñano, 2017), Korean (Park, 
2018), and Wao Terero (Fawcett, 2018). There is also a possible attestation of a boundary case 
predicted by the theory: in three related Luhya languages (Bantu, Niger-Congo), ideophones are 
consistently low in expressiveness and high in morphosyntactic integration (Bowler & Gluckman, 
2017). Table 2 lists the languages for which there is published evidence on the relation between 
expressiveness and morphosyntactic integration of ideophones.

Table 2. Languages that exhibit the expressiveness-integration interaction 
 
Expressiveness in ideophones helps signal their depictive mode of signification: it sets them 
apart as words that show rather than tell. This status aparte is reinforced by their grammatical 
independence, which explains the inverse relation between expressiveness and grammatical 
integration found in many languages. Additional evidence for this inverse relation comes from 
gesture. Across languages, iconic gestures are most likely to co-occur with ideophones when they 
are at their most depictive, as marked by high levels of expressiveness and low levels of 
grammatical integration (Kunene, 1965 for Sesotho; Reiter, 2012 for Awetí; Dingemanse & 
Akita, 2017 for Japanese and cross-linguistic evidence). This strongly suggests that a full 
understanding of ideophones as depictions calls for a multimodal examination that takes into 
account both linguistic and extra-linguistic features (see Nuckolls et al., 2016–present for a video-
aided illustration of Pastaza Quichua ideophones). 
3. Iconicity in Ideophones 
One of the more commonly mentioned properties of ideophones is iconicity: the resemblance 
between aspects of forms and meanings. Iconicity in ideophones takes on several forms, is used for 
a range of functions, and has consequences for linguistic theory – the three main topics taken up 
in this section. A caveat: ideophones are sometimes simply defined as iconic words (Johnson, 
1976; Tedlock, 1999), but this is an oversimplification for two reasons: (i) the form-meaning 
associations found in ideophones range from those that are easily detectable for non-native 

8 
Ideophones (Mimetics, Expressives) 
 
speakers (and potentially universal) to those that are more dependent on properties of the local 
linguistic system (and potentially lineage-specific); and (ii) as conventionalised items that have to 
be learned and show varying degrees of linguistic integration, ideophones will always show some 
arbitrary properties as well. 
3.1. Forms of iconicity 
Lexical iconicity is a perceived resemblance between aspects of form and meaning in lexical items. 
In spoken words, this form of iconicity is sometimes called sound-symbolism. Ideophones offer 
one of the best places to observe the possibility space for iconic associations between sound and 
sense. Formal aspects of speech like acoustic properties, articulatory gestures, prosody, and higher-
level features like syllable structure and reduplication may be iconically associated with a wide 
range of semantic features like sound, size, movement, intensity, texture, duration, aspect, and 
valence (Westermann, 1927; Diffloth, 1972; Nuckolls, 1999; Mihas, 2012).  
Take Japanese hisohiso ‘whispering secretively’ (Kakehi, Tamori, & Schourup, 1996, p. 529). 
The fricated, unvoiced consonants help to depict an acoustic image of whispering (a form of 
IMAGIC iconicity). The reduplicated syllables provide a perceptual analogy to the durative aspect 
of the depicted event (a form of DIAGRAMMATIC iconicity). However, not all aspects of the 
ideophone can be given a straightforward iconic interpretation: the syllable structure appears to be 
determined more by Japanese phonotactic rules than by iconic considerations, and it is not clear 
that the vowels make specific contributions.1 Likewise, not all aspects of the meaning ascribed to 
an ideophone necessarily have counterparts in its form: for instance, the ‘secretive’ connotation of 
hisohiso is likely a pragmatically enriched rather than an iconically encoded meaning. This 
combination of iconicity, arbitrariness, and pragmatically enriched meanings is typical of 
ideophones across languages. 
How do we know our iconic interpretations of hisohiso are on firm ground? They barely rise 
above the level of intuitions, making them susceptible to cherry-picking and confirmation bias. 
Intuitive accounts of iconic mappings are still surprisingly common in work on ideophones, and 
they represent the soft underbelly of the field. The way forward is to treat them as placeholders for 
independent empirical evidence. The gold standard is experimental data: to the extent that an 
ideophone resembles aspects of its meaning, it should be easier to learn or to guess. When given 
hisohiso and two possible meanings, ‘whispering’ and ‘shouting’, naïve speakers of Dutch chose the 
right meaning 97% of the time (Lockwood, Hagoort, & Dingemanse, 2016).  
Cross-linguistic data is a second source of evidence for iconic mappings. The association 
between unvoiced fricatives and the sound of whispering is found not just in Japanese hisohiso but 
also in equivalents like Korean s’oktaks’oktak and Mandarin Chinese xisuo (Akita, 2013a, p. 26). 
When a form-meaning association is found in multiple unrelated languages, it is more likely to be 
a bona fide case of iconicity.2 Experimental and cross-linguistic evidence like this makes it possible 
to turn just-so stories about iconicity into empirically grounded explanations. 
While hisohiso seems to be primarily about sound, ideophones can provide crossmodal 
associations to all sorts of sensory scenes, as in Siwu gbadara-gbadara ‘a drunkard’s wobbling gait’, 
Korean c’ukɨlc’ukɨl ‘wrinkled, e.g. as an un-ironed shirt’, or Japanese fuwafuwa ‘fluffy’. In languages 
                                                   
1 Unlike some other ideophones, this form does not occur in minimal pairs that allow us to draw conclusions 
about the absolute or relative iconic contributions of vowels or consonant voicing (Hamano, 1998). 
2 Note this is phrased in terms of probability, not necessity. Since both form and meaning have many 
dimensions, the possibility space for iconic mappings is large (though not without limit), and languages may use 
iconic affordances in different ways. Lexical iconicity is probabilistic, not deterministic (Dingemanse, 2018).

with large ideophone inventories, sound-imitative ideophones appear to form a minority 
(Samarin, 1965), perhaps simply because there are only so many events that make sound, and 
many more that offer other affordances for iconic associations. 
The cumulative progression from concrete imagic to more abstract diagrammatic associations 
can be traced in the ontogeny and typology of spoken languages. In ontogeny, onomatopoeia are 
among the earliest learned words (Laing, 2014). Although acquisition studies of languages with 
large ideophone systems are still relatively rare, evidence from Japanese suggests that ideophones 
imitative of sound (‘phonomimes’) are learned earlier than those imitative of other sensory scenes 
(Herlofsky, 1998), and that they show relatively more morphosyntactic freedom than other 
ideophones (Hamano, 1988; Akita, 2009). This has led Akita to posit a “Lexical Iconicity 
Hierarchy” according to which phonomimes are ranked before phenomimes and psychomimes 
(Akita, 2009, 2013b). In typology, a similar cumulative progression is observed in the 
composition and distribution of ideophone systems: ideophones imitative of sound are universally 
attested, closely followed by ideophones imitative of motion and visual patterns, while ideophones 
that show more abstract iconic associations tend to be found in languages with larger ideophone 
inventories. This can be formulated as an implicational hierarchy: there is no language without 
ideophones imitative of sound; if a language has ideophones for motion, it also has ideophones for 
sound; and so on (Dingemanse, 2012).

3.2. Functions of iconicity in ideophones 
When using an ideophone, “the speaker conjures up before the eyes of his listeners events which 
are not actually happening, or states which are not existing, at the time of speaking. It is for this 
reason that ideophones are so often accompanied by gestures of mimicry” (Kunene, 1965, p. 21). 
One place where such “conjuring up” is useful is in storytelling, and indeed stories have long been 
identified as a key locus of ideophone use (Whitehead, 1899; Burbridge, 1938; Kunene, 1965). 
But storytelling is not the only place where it is useful to have iconic means to evoke sensory 
scenes. 
In Japanese medical interactions, doctors and patients can use ideophones to express sensations 
that are otherwise hard to verbalise (Sakamoto, Ueda, Doizaki, & Shimizu, 2014). The iconicity 
of at least some Japanese pain ideophones has been independently established (Iwasaki, Vinson, & 
Vigliocco, 2007). Another setting where ideophones are put to use is in joint work, where people 
need to hone in on the same kind of percepts and demonstrate their expertise in the process 
(Nuckolls, 1996). In Ashéninka Perené, an Arawak language spoken in Peru, ideophones are used 
along with iconic gestures in expert-novice interactions, for instance cooking sessions or the 
preparation of herbal treatments (Mihas, 2013). Ideophones and iconic gestures are well-suited to 
these kinds of participatory learning situations because they wear their meaning on their sleeve. 
Embedded in hands-on learning situations, they function as “scaffolding tools” that “contribute to 
the formation and distribution of embodied knowledge” (Mihas, 2013, p. 57). In this sense, 
ideophones are quite like iconic gestures, which have been shown to enhance comprehension by 
providing alternative, analogical representations that highlight perceptual-motor information 
(Alibali & Kita, 2010; Campisi & Özyürek, 2013). 

10 
Ideophones (Mimetics, Expressives) 
 
If the perceptual analogies provided by ideophones are useful in this kind of explicitly didactic 
situation, it is not hard to imagine that they may also facilitate aspects of language learning. This 
has been the focus of a rich vein of experimental work in developmental psychology. At least since 
Yoshida (2004), it has been hypothesised that ideophones may provide an “iconic bridge between 
sound and meaning” (Yoshida, 2004, p. 21) that may help in word learning (for a recent review, 
see Perniss & Vigliocco, 2014). Experiments with newly created iconic words for manner of 
motion show that ideophone-like words are easier to learn than arbitrary words for young toddlers 
as well as for adults (Imai, Kita, Nagumo, & Okada, 2008; Yoshida, 2012; Miyazaki et al., 2013). 
A comparison of Japanese adjectives and ideophones found that ideophones are easier to learn for 
adult participants (Lockwood et al., 2016). 
In sum, while early philologists working on the basis of English speculated that imitative words 
were of little use except as “playthings” (Müller, 1861), empirical work on languages around the 
world paints a different picture. Far from mere toys, ideophones emerge as important 
communicative tools. From patients expressing pain sensations to young children learning their 
first motion words, ideophones show how iconicity can bridge sound and sense.  
3.3. Theoretical consequences 
The prominence of iconicity in ideophones is not without consequences for broader linguistic 
theory. One implication, argued most forcefully by Diffloth (1972), is that ideophones form an 
important counterexample to the principle of duality of patterning: the idea that words combine 
meaningless phonemes to form meaningful morphemes (Hockett, 1960; Blevins, 2012). As 
Diffloth notes, systematic iconic vowel alternations in ideophones would lead one to analyse 
vowel height as a morpheme, while similar alternations in consonants would mean the same for 
consonant voicing, and “once we begin the search for recurrent partials with associated meanings, 
there seems to be no way to stop” (Diffloth, 1972, p. 442). The problem is similar to the in-
between status of phonaesthemes in morphological theory (Bergen, 2004; Kwon & Round, 
2014), but it is compounded for ideophones because rather than isolated clusters of vocabulary, 
ideophones can form lexical classes on the same order of magnitude as nouns and verbs.  
Zwicky and Pullum’s theory of expressive morphology (Zwicky & Pullum, 1987) attempts to 
plug this theoretical hole by quarantining ideophones and putting them “in a domain orthogonal 
to the grammar,” along with language play and expletive infixation. Others have argued for giving 
ideophones their full due. McCarthy used evidence from ideophones in an influential account of 
nonconcatenative morphology and noted, “these exotic phenomena pervade the world’s languages 
with a regularity and complexity that makes them both essential and ideal for testing any theory 
of morphology” (McCarthy, 1983, p. 135). The advantages extend to phonology: iconic patterns 
in Korean and Japanese ideophones played a crucial role in seminal accounts of the nature of 
phonological features (Kim-Renaud, 1978; Mester & Itô, 1989). The hybrid nature of ideophones 
– as words that are (i) vocal gestures partaking in analogical and iconic modes of meaning, quite 
unlike arbitrary lexical items and yet at the same time (ii) conventionalised forms mostly built 
using regular phonemes – has made them a crucial testing ground for many areas of theoretical 
linguistics (Dingemanse, 2018; Ferrara & Hodge, 2018). 
An influential line of work in experimental psychology attaches great weight to a particular 
type of cross-modal association first identified by Gestalt psychologists like Köhler, in which 
nonwords like maluma and takete are linked to rounded versus jagged shapes. This form of 
“sound-symbolism,” recently reincarnated in the form of bouba and kiki, has attracted much 
attention and is often claimed to provide insight into matters of language evolution and language 
learning (Ramachandran & Hubbard, 2001). Ideophones provide an exciting possibility to

compare such lab-induced cross-modal experiences to iconic associations actually attested in 
natural languages. Recent work shows that naïve experimental subjects are sensitive to iconicity in 
ideophones (Iwasaki et al., 2007; Revill, Namy, DeFife, & Nygaard, 2014), but that success rates 
in guessing their meanings are substantially lower than those obtained in experiments with 
pseudowords. So ideophones provide a reality check for the power of iconicity in natural language. 
But they also exhibit many cross-modal associations beyond maluma and takete (Westermann, 
1927; Vigliocco & Kita, 2006): a fertile testing ground for the influence of iconicity on language 
processing, communication, and learning. 
4. In closing: the relevance of ideophones for linguistics 
Ideophones are increasingly recognised as a major word class found in many of the world’s 
languages. Here we have reviewed three key topics related to the place of ideophones in the 
language sciences:  
Definition. Like other major word classes, ideophones show a number of prototypical 
properties while also allowing a degree of language-specific variation. Key properties of 
ideophones include their marked forms, their depictive semiotics, and their sensory meanings. As 
expected, languages differ in the degree to which these properties describe ideophones, but 
together they capture a prototypical core close to Doke’s original characterisation: “A vivid 
representation of an idea in sound”. 
Integration. To declare ideophones as deviant or unintegrated is to miss important 
generalisations about their relation to other subsystems and levels of linguistic structure. While 
ideophones do deviate from prosaic words in some respects, they do so in regular ways and with a 
systematicity of their own. And while many ideophones are characterised by syntactic 
independence, their varying degrees of syntactic integration sheds light on processes of 
ideophonisation and deideophonisation, and shows how language combines descriptive and 
depictive uses of speech material. 
Iconicity. While not all ideophones are iconic to the same degree, ideophones remain one of the 
best places to see lexical iconicity in action. Iconicity in ideophones helps word learning and 
communication in a wide range of contexts. Iconic mappings between form and meaning show 
some universal tendencies but also less widespread patterns, making ideophones a natural 
laboratory for the scientific study of how people link sound and sense. 
These topics do not nearly exhaust the richness of recent research on ideophones (for reviews, 
see Vigliocco & Kita, 2006; Akita, 2015; Armoskaite & Koskinen, 2017; Ibarretxe-Antuñano, 
2017; Svantesson, 2017). The increasing availability of descriptive, theoretical, and experimental 
work on ideophones in diverse languages is likely to inspire further work on a much broader range 
of topics.
