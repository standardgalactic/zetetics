Noise in existing quantum processors only en-
ables an approximation to ideal quantum compu-
tation.
However, these approximations can be
vastly improved by error mitigation [1, 2], for
the computation of expectation values, as shown
by small-scale experimental demonstrations [3–6].
However, the practical scaling of these methods
to larger system sizes remains unknown.
Here,
we demonstrate the utility of zero-noise extrap-
olation [1–3] for relevant quantum circuits using
up to 26 qubits, circuit depths of 60, and 1080
CNOT gates. We study the scaling of the method
for canonical examples of product states and en-
tangling Cliﬀord circuits of increasing size, and
extend it to the quench dynamics of 2-D Ising
spin lattices with varying couplings.
We show
that the eﬃcacy of the error mitigation is greatly
enhanced by additional error suppression tech-
niques and native gate decomposition that re-
duce the circuit time. By combining these meth-
ods, we demonstrate an accuracy in the approx-
imate quantum simulation of the quench dynam-
ics that surpasses the classical approximations ob-
tained from a state of the art 2-D tensor network
method. These results reveal a path to a relevant
quantum advantage with noisy, digital, quantum
processors.
Decoherence and unitary gate errors currently limit the
volume and ﬁdelity of quantum circuits. While this can
be remedied with the advent of quantum error correc-
tion [7, 8], a fully fault-tolerant hardware architecture is
not immediately accessible. Although existing quantum
processors [9–11] have achieved a size that pushes at the
boundaries of classical simulability, it is important to ask
if such noisy machines can perform useful computations.
In this context, recent theoretical work has proven that
even noisy shallow depth quantum circuits can outper-
form their noiseless classical counterparts [12]. Further-
more, recently proposed error mitigation techniques [1–3]
present a path to obtain accurate expectation values even
on noisy quantum computers.
The general operating
principle of these techniques is to reconstruct a noise-free
estimate of an expectation value, from multiple noisy ex-
periments. These techniques are particularly attractive
for the near-term because they typically require no ad-
ditional overhead for the most valuable resources - qubit
number and circuit depth. While error mitigation only
improves the estimation of expectation values, such com-
putations represent a sizable portion of near-term quan-
tum algorithms, for instance, the estimation of molecular
energies [13, 14] in variational quantum eigensolvers, or
kernel estimation in machine learning [15, 16]. This has
motivated a number of theoretical proposals and exper-
imental demonstrations of error mitigation, that can be
broadly categorized into general-purpose [1–6, 17, 18] and
problem-speciﬁc techniques [19–21].
A widely adopted general-purpose error mitigation
technique is zero-noise extrapolation. Here, expectation
values are measured for circuits run at varying noise lev-
els to extrapolate to its zero noise-limit. The noise lev-
els in the circuit are typically varied either by stretch-
ing the control pulses in time [1, 3], or by the insertion
of noisy identity-equivalent operations [4, 22].
Recent
extensions also involve learning the noise ampliﬁcation
factors with near-Cliﬀord training circuits [23, 24]. Ini-
tial small-scale experiments with just four qubits of a
ﬁxed-frequency superconducting transmon [25] processor
and stretching of pulses in entangling cross-resonance
gates [26] demonstrated the promise of the technique -
enabling variational ansatz with increased circuit depth
to achieve ground-state energies with far-improved accu-
racy for molecular and interacting spin Hamiltonians [3].
However, the hardware-platform has witnessed tremen-
dous improvements since this initial demonstration. The
size of the largest quantum processors based on this ar-
chitecture now lies at 65 qubits [9], reported transmon
coherence times are exceeding several hundred microsec-
onds [27], cross-resonance gate ﬁdelities are approach-
ing 99.9 % with sub-100 ns gate times [28], with steady
progress in holistic metrics such as quantum volume [29]
as well. This raises a tantalizing question of how much
these hardware improvements could extend the reach of
zero-noise extrapolation to perform accurate quantum
computation at a larger scale, into the realm of quan-
tum advantage.
In this context, once we approach a
scale where the general performance of an error mitiga-
tion technique cannot be compared to exact numerics, it
is particularly important to understand the error bounds,
as provided for the methods discussed in [1]. For zero-
noise extrapolation, a loose upper bound on the error of
the zero-noise estimate after n-th order Richardson ex-
trapolation is ∼O((NTλ)n+1), where N is the number
of qubits, λ is a parameter that describes the strength
of the noise (eg. λ ∼T −1
1
for purely amplitude damping
noise with energy relaxation time T1) and T is the total
evolution time. Therefore, the performance of zero-noise
extrapolation is expected to be limited by NTλ being a
small number.

Zero-noise extrapolation for intermediate-scale short-depth quantum circuits An example of a 26-qubit
short-depth quantum circuit composed of layers of single qubit (RX) and two qubit (RZZ) gates that we employ to study the
performance of error mitigation. The noise is ampliﬁed for zero-noise extrapolation by a appropriately scaling the duration and
amplitude of the microwave pulses that compose the gates. A number of additional techniques are employed to enhance the
performance of zero-noise extrapolation, that are not incorporated for the bare circuit. The insertion of dynamical decoupling
Xπ −X−π sequences is used to suppress dephasing during qubit idle times. Pauli twirling averages out oﬀ-diagonal coherent
errors in the Pauli basis and is implemented by sandwiching the two-qubit gates with additional single qubit gates drawn
from a set of Pauli operations. The twirling gates can be combined with original single qubit gates into arbitrary single-qubit
rotations U(θ, φ, ϕ) = RZ(φ)RX(−π/2)RZ(θ)RX(π/2)RZ(ϕ) to minimize any additional circuit time. The total evolution time
is dominated by two-qubit gates, and can be reduced by native-gate decomposition. The standard decomposition of RZZ(θ)
operations for arbitrary θ uses two CNOT gates, that are each constructed on our hardware using cross-resonance pulses to
tune fully-entangling RZX(π/2) operations. Alternately, the circuit time can be signiﬁcantly reduced by constructing RZZ(θ)
gates from partially-entangling cross-resonance pulses that implement RZX(θ).
In this work, we experimentally study the performance
of zero-noise extrapolation for circuits employing up to
26 transmon qubits of a ﬁxed-frequency quantum pro-
cessor, for a maximum circuit depth of 60 with a max-
imum CNOT count of 1080 gates (Fig. 1).
We ini-
tially present a couple of canonical examples - the T1
decay of multi-qubit product states, and 21-qubit Green-
berger–Horne–Zeilinger (GHZ) states.
These experi-
ments suggest that the realistic error bounds are far bet-
ter than the loose upper bounds discussed above. Even
for a ﬁxed number of qubits N, the errors in the extrapo-
lation display circuit-speciﬁc dependencies on the weight
and locality of the mitigated observables. We then ex-
tend our experiments to non-Cliﬀord circuits, studying
the time dynamics of a 26 spin Ising Hamiltonian for
varying system parameters.
We show that the perfor-
mance of zero-noise extrapolation can be signiﬁcantly en-
hanced by suppressing λ with additional error suppres-
sion strategies and reducing the circuit evolution time
T with more eﬃcient gate decomposition and compiling,
depicted in Fig. 1. With these improvements, we show
that we can already begin to achieve an accuracy on er-
ror mitigated observables, measured oﬀa noisy quantum
processor, that is able to surpass the accuracy of an es-

3
tablished tensor network method in the simulation of dy-
namics [30].
We perform our experiments on a superconducting
processor with 27 transmon qubits, and ﬁxed connec-
tivity in the heavy-hex
[31] geometry. The connectiv-
ity is favourable towards the frequency imprecision [32]
and crosstalk of ﬁxed-frequency superconducting archi-
tectures, while enabling the implementation of quantum
error correcting codes [31]. All the control and readout
of the qubits is performed with microwave pulses, with
entangling operations based oﬀthe cross-resonance [26]
eﬀect, with a native ZX interaction. Additional details
of the device are provided in the Supplementary Infor-
mation.
First, we study the performance of zero-noise extrapo-
lation for trivial, multi-qubit product states prepared by
simultaneous T1 decay circuits on an initial |1⊗N⟩state,
see inset of Fig. 2(a-b). As shown in the original pro-
posal [1], the noise can be ampliﬁed by stretching the
circuit’s time evolution, under the assumption of time
invariant noise.
Here, this amounts to simply stretch-
ing the wait times in the T1 decay circuits. In order to
reduce the eﬀect of coherence ﬂuctuations
[3, 33], all
the stretched circuits in this work are averaged together,
as discussed previously [3]. Unless otherwise speciﬁed,
all the experiments discussed in the main text employ
100,000 shots for every stretch factor, and the reported
expectation values are corrected for measurement error
using a tensor product of individual qubit readout cali-
bration matrices [12]. Fig. 2(a) depicts the decay of ⟨Z⟩
for the considered stretch factors ci = 1, 1.5 and 2, and
the mitigated observable constructed by linear extrapola-
tion. The mitigated observable shows far superior accu-
racy over the raw data, even for circuit times going up to
100µs, comparable to the T1 of the measured qubit. On a
line of 5 qubits, we then compare the accuracy of increas-
ing weight Z-observables after linear extrapolation, going
up to ⟨Z0Z1Z2Z3Z4⟩, for varying delay times. As seen in
Fig. 2(b), the lower-weight observables display a superior
accuracy, for the same state preparation circuit/number
of qubits.
We next study the performance of zero-noise extrap-
olation for low-weight observables for large entangled
states. We prepare a GHZ state by applying CNOTs se-
quentially for 21 qubits along the longest 1D chain in the
layout as depicted in Fig. 2(d). There are two sets of ob-
servables we examine, the local observables Zj−1Zj and
the non-local observables Z0Zj for j = 1, 2, . . . , N −1 =
20, that all have ideal expectations of +1. The CNOT
gates are constructed from calibrated cross-resonance
(CR) sequences, and all the pulses in the circuit are ex-
tended by the considered stretch factors c = 1, 1.3, 1.6.
The circuit structure leads to long idling times, and we
see that dynamical decoupling sequences, shown in Fig. 1
suppress qubit dephasing and enhance the quality of error
mitigation. Fig. 2(c-d) illustrates the unmitigated and
mitigated expectation values obtained from linear extrap-
olation. Due to the circuit structure, unmitigated values

Scaling of zero-noise extrapolation for prod-
uct states and entangling Cliﬀord circuits a Error-
mitigated (red) and unmitigated decay of ⟨Z⟩for a standard
T1 decay circuit. The unmitigated experiments are performed
for three diﬀerent stretch factors, ci = 1, 1.5, 2, by stretching
the T1 delay times (denoted as Id in inset of b). The mitigated
curve is obtained by a linear extrapolation of the observables
measured from the stretched experiments. Inset depicts the
device connectivity and highlights the ﬁve qubits employed

Mitigated estimates are obtained by a
linear extrapolation of the unmitigated data for stretch fac-
tors ci = 1, 1.3, 1.6. The inset of c shows the one dimensional
chain of 21 qubits used in the experiment, indexed 0 for the
top leftmost qubit with increasing indices following the arrow,
and the inset of d depicts the GHZ state-preparation circuit.
The qubit distance for the x-axis of d is deﬁned by the diﬀer-
ence in qubit index, for non-local observables. All the exper-
iments shown in this ﬁgure have ideal expectation values of
magnitude +1. The error bars for the error-mitigated results
in a,b,c,d are computed from 50 numerical experiments by
bootstrapping the experimental distributions. The individual
bootstrapping results are plotted as light red traces for clarity
in a,b,c,d.
of these observables suﬀer n-dependent error rates. For
example, consider a simple error model where X errors
occur after both 2-qubit and 1-qubit gates (including idle
locations) in the circuit, but with diﬀerent probabilities
p2 and p1. We also make the simplifying but largely real-
istic assumption that qubits in the ground state (i.e. be-
fore any gate is applied) do not suﬀer errors except for
some initialization X error at rate p0. A speciﬁc observ-
able is sensitive to errors at only a subset of locations.

4
Generally, if an X error at any of E2 2-qubit locations,
E1 1-qubit locations, or E0 initializations ﬂips observable
O, the probability its expectation is −1 is
P−1 = 1
2(1 −(1 −2p2)E2(1 −2p1)E1(1 −2p0)E0)
(1)
and thus ⟨O⟩= (1−2p2)E2(1−2p1)E1(1−2p0)E0. A local
observable Zj−1Zj is sensitive to errors on qubits j −1
and j after the CNOT from j −1 to j and one of the two
initializations, implying E0 = 1, E1+E2 = 2(N −j), and
E2 = 3 for j < N −1 and E2 = 2 for j = N −1. For a
non-local observable Z0Zj, E1+E2 = 2(N−1) is constant
with j, but E2 = 2 + j and E0 = j. Assuming p2 > p1
and small N, we therefore expect a near-linear increase
in the local expectations ⟨Zj−1Zj⟩with n and an ex-
ponential decrease in the non-local expectations ⟨Z0Zj⟩.
These trends are present in the experimental data. Con-
sequently, error mitigated observables follow the same
trends. This suggests that one should pay careful atten-
tion to circuit structure when applying zero-noise extrap-
olation, and choose to mitigate observables that are less
sensitive to noise, such as local observables.
Finally, we discuss the performance of zero-noise ex-
trapolation on short-depth non-Cliﬀord circuits. As an
example, we study the quench dynamics of a transverse-
ﬁeld Ising model. The problem entails studying the evo-
lution of a system under the following Hamiltonian:
H = −J
X
⟨i,j⟩
ZiZj + h
X
i
Xi,
(2)
where J is the strength of the exchange coupling be-
tween nearest-neighbor spins with indices ⟨i, j⟩, and h
is the transverse magnetic ﬁeld. The study of quantum
quenches with interacting spin-1/2 systems provides a
rich playground for explorations of fundamental ques-
tions in condensed matter and statistical physics [34],
and have already been explored extensively on analog
quantum simulators [35–37]. These models are also be-
coming a particularly attractive application of existing,
noisy, digital quantum computers [38–41] with their in-
creased control and addressability. The spins can be nat-
urally encoded in the physical qubits, nearest-neighbor
interactions are accessible with the local-connectivity of
the qubits, and relevant quantities can be measured by
local, low-weight observables.
While this Hamiltonian
can be fully diagonalized by a spin to fermion mapping
in 1-D and even analytical solutions are known for trans-
lationally invariant chains, no such procedure is known
for the 2-D model. This makes the 2-D Ising model an
attractive testbed for the pursuit of quantum advantage
on near-term quantum processors [42].
Here, we study the quench dynamics of a 2-D spin
lattice that follows the connectivity of our processor, ex-
cluding a single inferior qubit. Starting in the ground
state of the non-interacting Hamiltonian (J = 0), with
the qubits initialized in |ψ0⟩= |0⊗26⟩, the time evolution
of the system is studied once the exchange coupling is
turned on suddenly at time t = 0.
|ψ(t)⟩= e−iHt|ψ0⟩.

We implement the dynamics on our hardware by a
ﬁrst-order Trotter decomposition of the the time evolu-
tion.

(5)
Unless otherwise speciﬁed, the experiments described
here ﬁx h = 1, T = 10, δt = 0.5 and study the dy-
namics for varying J. The evolution can now be imple-
mented via a combination of single-qubit rotations and
ZZ two-qubit gates between pairs of connected qubits on
the lattice. We study the dynamics for up to 26 spins on
a 2-D lattice and n = 20 Trotter steps, where Fig. 3(a-b)
illustrates each Trotter layer implements 3 blocks of par-
allelized two-qubit gates on next-nearest neighbors, for a
maximum circuit depth of 60.
Although a comparison to the ideal result, obtained by
exact numerical simulation, is possible for sizes up to 26
spins, a mere increase in system size by a factor of 2-3
renders this unfeasible. At this larger scale, only approx-
imate classical methods are available.
It is important
to point out here, that the quantum experiment itself
only provides an approximation to the idealized simula-
tion due to the hardware noise. To establish the validity
of approximate quantum computation with error mitiga-
tion, it is therefore prudent to compare to established
approximate classical methods that scale eﬃciently.
Simulating time dynamics of general quantum systems
is a class of decision problems solvable in polynomial time
by a quantum computer, BQP-complete [43], and no
classical approximation method is therefore expected to
produce a universally accurate approximation. However,
a wide range of approximate classical simulation methods
[44–46] have been developed that provide good approx-
imations in various limiting cases. Starting from a lim-
iting case where the approximation works well, we want
to provide a comparison with the quantum approxima-
tion and see for which parameter values the experimen-
tal expectation values provide a higher accuracy. Here,
we focus on a comparison with tensor network methods
since our experiment considers a locally interacting spin
Hamiltonian. In particular, since we consider the dynam-
ics of 2-D systems, we compare the experimental results

Quench dynamics of 2-D Ising spin lattices: Error mitigated quantum simulation compared to PEPS

for the links indicates the three sets of simultaneously driven two-qubit gates, based of the device connectivity. b Schematic of
Trotter circuits for studying the quench dynamics of the Ising Hamiltonian described by Eq. 4. Each Trotter layer is composed of
a single qubit gates RX(2hδt) and three sets of simultaneously driven (indicated by color coding) two-qubit gates RZZ(−2Jδt).
The simulation parameters for the subsequent experiments are transverse ﬁeld h = 1, maximum evolution time T = 10, and

to the standard projected entangled pair state (PEPS)
method [30, 47, 48]. These states are the current prime
candidate to capture ground state properties of gapped
2-D spin systems. This method can also be used to ap-
proximate dynamics of weakly entangled systems, but it
is generally expected that the PEPS simulation will be-
come inaccurate when strong entanglement is produced
[49].
Here, we consider the original PEPS time evolution
algorithm [30] with bond dimensions D = 4. The algo-
rithm scales as O(D12N) in time and O(D8) in memory
and can become numerically unstable for larger bond di-
mensions. At each Trotter step, we estimate the aver-
age magnetization of the interacting spin system by a
measurement of the weight-1 observables averaged over
26 qubits - ⟨X⟩, ⟨Y ⟩, ⟨Z⟩. We quantify and compare to
the experimental error in terms of the normalized Eu-
clidean distance between the magnetization vectors ob-
tained from PEPS and the ideal vector. Fig. 3(c-e) show
that PEPS exhibits excellent agreement with the exact
numerics over the entire range of the Trotterized evolu-
tion when the RZZ(θ) gates are weakly entangling for
J = 0.1, but displays increasingly poorer accuracy with
increasing J and trotter steps.
With our digital approach, the time evolution for dif-
ferent coupling parameters can be experimentally studied
by simply varying the angle of the single qubit rotations
RX(2hδt) and the two qubit gates RZZ(−2Jδt). Arbi-
trary RZZ(θ) gates can be implemented on our device
by using 2 CNOT gates and additional single qubit rota-
tions, where the CNOT gates are themselves constructed
from cross-resonance driven RZX(π/2) interactions that
are native to our hardware. This enables us to compare
the performance of zero-noise extrapolation on circuits
with the same structure and evolution time, while sys-
tematically increasing the amount of entanglement with
increasing J. Error mitigation is ultimately limited by
the noise in the circuit, and in order to extend its reach,
we adopt additional error reduction strategies such as
dynamical decoupling, previously discussed for GHZ cir-
cuits. Furthermore, an important source of crosstalk in
ﬁxed-frequency architectures is the ZZ interaction [28],
that can be an important limitation to circuit ﬁdelity,
and particularly problematic for circuits simulating Ising
Hamiltonians. In this context, Pauli twirling [50, 51] is an
attractive approach to average out oﬀ-diagonal coherent
errors of the circuit in the Pauli basis and improve cir-
cuit ﬁdelity [52]. It also enables the suppression of coher-
ent errors in the gate-rescaling [3] that could otherwise
lead to unphysical extrapolations. Here, each two-qubit
gate is sandwiched between twirling gates and inverting
gates such that the same unitary is implemented, and
for two-qubit Cliﬀord operations such as CNOT gates,
the twirling gates can be sampled randomly from a set
of tensor products of all single-qubit Pauli gates. By in-
corporating these error suppression strategies with linear
extrapolation, we estimate the magnetization, and the
corresponding error for J = 0.1, 0.3, 0.5236 in Fig. 3(c-
e).
Interestingly, the accuracy of the error mitigated
magnetization does not reveal a strong dependence on
the degree of entanglement in experiment. As a conse-
quence, our error mitigated experiment provides an in-
creasingly competitive approximation to the magnetiza-
tion over PEPS, for increasing J. Therefore, we focus
on the case of J = 0.5236, that speciﬁcally requires the
implementation of RZZ(π/6) gates for our chosen Hamil-
tonian and Trotterization parameters.
With CNOT decomposition, our longest circuit times
exceed 80 µs, limiting the accuracy of the mitigated ob-
servables. For J = 0.5236, the performance of our ex-
periment can be further enhanced by employing a more
time-eﬀective gate decomposition that uses shorter cross-
resonance pulses to calibrate partially entangling [3, 53]
RZX(π/6) gates. Details of the calibration and bench-
marking are discussed in the supplementary section.
With this decomposition, we achieve a ∼4× reduction
in circuit time. These considerations and strategies high-
light the beneﬁt of pulse-level stretching for error ampli-
ﬁcation and the associated freedom over choice of stretch
factors. For large volume circuits, error ampliﬁcation via
the insertion of identity equivalent gates can lead to cir-
cuit times beyond the coherence budget. Additionally,
we show that a Pauli twirling strategy can also be em-
ployed with the non-Cliﬀord, fractional RZZ(θ) gates,
albeit with a limited set of twirling gates, see Supple-
mentary Information. Remarkably, even for these large
volume circuits, we observe improvements in circuit per-
formance for a very modest number of twirled circuit
instances ∼8, see Supplementary Information.
The impact of the combined error suppression strate-
gies is visualized in Fig. 3(f) by tracking the evolution of
the magnetization vector. Furthermore, the error miti-
gated trajectory displays excellent qualitative agreement
with the ideal noise-less path in Fig. 3(g), while the tra-
jectory obtained from PEPS diverges at increasing Trot-
ter steps. With the optimal gate decomposition, we see
that the error mitigated experiment provides a closer ap-
proximation to the magnetization than PEPS even for
Trotter steps exceeding n = 6 for the largest value of
J = 0.5236 considered in this work, Fig. 3(e). However,
we also note that the accuracy of larger-weight observ-
ables, after error mitigation, is not as competitive, see
Supplementary information. We also compare the mag-
netization error for increasing qubit number (and vary-
ing 2D lattices), and map this for increasing numbers of
Trotter steps in Fig. 3(h),(i). We see that our experi-
ment is closer to the ideal simulation than PEPS for a
large part of this phase space, particularly for increas-
ing qubit number and Trotter steps. These observations
of accurate coherent dynamics in error mitigated expec-
tation values going up to 26 qubit circuits with depth
d = 60, in conjunction with the scaling of the PEPS
(D = 4) error shown in Fig. 3(i), raises the enticing pos-
sibility of studying quench dynamics on noisy, digital,
fully-programmable quantum processors that are beyond
exact diagonalization as well as eﬃcient, classical approx-

7
imate techniques.
The experiments discussed here highlight several im-
portant considerations to access competitive computa-
tions from noisy, intermediate-sized quantum processors.
We demonstrate the scalability of zero noise extrapola-
tion and show that a number of experimental strategies
can be employed to further enhance its performance on
a noisy device. Eﬀorts to improve the noise scaling can
enable higher order Richardson that provide error miti-
gated expectation values with an even higher degree of
accuracy, that we expect to be continually supplemented
by improvements in the coherence and quality of quan-
tum hardware.
Already, with existing error rates and
linear extrapolation, we see that error mitigated magne-
tization dynamics of 2-D Ising quenches for 26 spins can
provide a better approximation than PEPS at (D = 4) in
the limit of increasing entanglement. In this context, the
development of 65 qubit processors based on our hard-
ware platform [9], with comparable error rates and 2-D
connectivity, makes these devices an attractive platform
for the exploration of error mitigated quantum dynamics
of 2-D spin systems that are classically intractable.

DEVICE CHARACTERISTICS
Our processor is a heavy-hex network of 27 single-Josephson junction transmon qubits with ﬁxed qubit-qubit
couplings with all-microwave control.
Single qubit gates are implemented using microwave pulses with Gaussian
envelope and DRAG corrections [S54]. Two qubit entangling gates are also implemented with microwave pulses,
employing the cross-resonance interaction [S26, S55]. Table SI summarizes the single-qubit metrics for the devices,

Two-qubit CNOT gates are constructed from cross-resonance (CR) pulses and single qubit rotations. The ZX
interaction is isolated by using an echoed-CR sequence on the control qubit QC with rotary drives on the target qubit
QT , and the gates are typically calibrated to a RZX(π/2) for CNOT construction. The pulse sequence was previously
reported in [S56] and is depicted in Figure S1(a). The fractional RZZ(θ) gates employed for the quench dynamics
were constructed from RZX(θ) sequences. Speciﬁcally the RZX(θ = π/6) gates considered here were calibrated to
a RZX(π/2) by repeating the gate three times, as illustrated in Figure S1(b). The width of the CR pulses for the
RZX(θ = π/6) were chosen to have calibrated amplitudes that were similar or smaller than the amplitudes employed
for CNOT calibration, with unchanged rise-fall proﬁles. With the fractional gates, the rise-fall sections form a larger
fraction of the pulse width, and the single qubit pulses form a larger fraction of the gate time. Hence, the gate time does
not exactly scale with the fraction of the original π/2 conditional rotation. All the two-qubit gates are characterized
by randomized benchmarking of CNOT gates constructed from either RZX(π/2) sequences or [RZX(π/6)]3 sequences,
and a summary of device-wide gate ﬁdelities are shown in Figure S1(c).

EXPERIMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR OPTIMAL PERFORMANCE OF ERROR
MITIGATION
The performance of quantum error mitigation strategies are ultimately limited by the noise in the circuit of interest.
In addition to reducing the circuit time by optimal gate decomposition, detailed in Fig. 1 and Sec. SI, we elaborate
on important experimental considerations to further suppress errors and enhance our signal-to-noise. The importance
of these considerations is illustrated by their impact on the quench circuits discussed in the main text.
A.
Dynamical decoupling
For the GHZ and quench circuits considered in this work, the physical connectivity and circuit structure leads to
idling times for qubits, that can be a source of dephasing and coherent errors from undesired classical and static ZZ
crosstalk. We see that some of these errors can be refocused by dynamical decoupling (DD) sequences [S57, S58] that
have been previously employed on our hardware to improve circuit ﬁdelity [S29]. We insert the following sequence
τ/4 −RX(π) −τ/2 −RX(−π) −τ/4 for every idling period of time, where τ is idling time minus the length of two
RX(π) pulses. We highlight the impact of DD on the quench dynamics for J = 0.1 with the c = 1 circuits in Fig. S2.
The ﬁgure shows speciﬁc examples of DD extending the circuit depth out to which clear coherent evolution of a
qubit can be observed (Fig. S2(a)), as well as the suppression of coherent error (Fig. S2(b)). This demonstrates the
importance of DD to improve the “bare” signal and enhance the performance of zero-noise extrapolation. We also
compared the performance of this sequence with other standard variants in Fig. S2(c), and did not observe discernible
improvements for our considered circuits.
B.
Pauli twirling
Although the dynamical decoupling (DD) sequences can help with refocusing some coherent errors, we ﬁnd Pauli
twirling [S50] to be another important ingredient for further enhancing circuit performance. Fig. S3(a) shows examples
of discernible coherent error in the results of post-DD quench circuits (J = 0.1). These coherent errors can also be
source of inaccurate noise scaling, leading to even unphysical expectation values after error mitigation, as seen in
FIG. S2. Impact of Dynamical decoupling on the performance of quench circuits The panels depict data from the
quench dynamics with 26 qubits, for J = 0.1. Unmitigated ⟨Z⟩observables, measured with and without DD, are compared to
the ideal evolution for individual qubits a Q0 and b Q9, and reveal the impact of DD in extending coherent evolution to longer
circuit depths, and refocusing coherent error, respectively. c Comparison of various DD sequences with the ideal evolution of
the average ⟨Z⟩. The sequence examined here includes τ/4 −RX(π) −τ/2 −RX(−π) −τ/4 (denoted as RX(π) −RX(−π)),
τ/8 −RX(π) −τ/4 −RY (π) −τ/4 −RX(π) −τ/4 −RY (π) −τ/8 (denoted as XY4)[S59], and τ/16 −RX(π) −τ/8 −RY (π) −
τ/8 −RX(π) −τ/8 −RY (π) −τ/8 −RY (π) −τ/8 −RX(π) −τ/8 −RY (π) −τ/8 −RX(π) −τ/16 (denoted as XY8)[S60], where
τ is the idling time of a qubit minus length of the total single qubit pulses in a given DD sequence. When the qubit idling
time is shorter than the total DD sequence length, we use shorter DD sequence (e.g. XY4 instead of XY8). No discernible
improvement is observed by increasing the number of decoupling pulses beyond the RX(π) −RX(−π) sequence, which we then
employ through the rest of this work.

FIG. S3. Impact of Pauli Twirling on the performance of quench circuits The panels depict data from the quench
dynamics with 26 qubits, for J = 0.1. Linear extrapolation is performed using stretched gates with c = 1, 1.3, 1.6, and DD
sequences are inserted for idling qubits. All experiments employed a total of 100,000 shots, per stretch factor. The experiments
with Pauli Twirling (PT) use 4 random twirling instances, with 25,000 shots for each instance. The experimentally measured
dynamics of the ⟨Z⟩magnetization is compared to the ideal evolution, with and without Pauli twirling (PT), for individual
qubits without mitigation in a Q5 and c Q11, and with mitigation in b Q5 and d Q11.
Fig. S3(b). Pauli twirling is a powerful technique to convert an arbitrary noise channel into a stochastic Pauli error
channel, suppressing oﬀ-diagonal coherent error contributions. This is implemented by sandwiching Cliﬀord gates
between randomly sampled twirling gates such that the net operation, in the absence of noise, is unchanged. The
twirling gates inserted before the Cliﬀord operation are typically sampled from a complete set of Pauli operations,
G = {I, X, Y, Z}⊗N for N qubits, and an appropriate set of Pauli operations are then applied after the Cliﬀord gate
for a net equivalent unitary operation. For our quench circuits with the CNOT decomposition of RZZ(θ) operations,
each CNOT (Cliﬀord) gate is sandwiched between gates randomly sampled from G and Pauli gates that preserve the
net CNOT operation, and the expectation values are then averaged over multiple twirling instances. For each CNOT,
the twirling gates are combined with other single qubit operations in the circuit, to avoid any increase in circuit
time. These circuit randomizations can be particularly helpful for suppressing the ampliﬁcation of coherent error in
structured circuits with repetitive gate layers such as the Trotter circuits considered in this work. Fig. S3(a-b) shows
that the incorrect oscillation period as well as inaccurate noise scaling are corrected using twirling gates. Fig. S3(c-d)
show another example that after twirling, the oscillations of the measured observable are “in-phase” with the ideal
evolution for the raw data and extrapolation results.
The native gate decomposition for RZZ(θ) signiﬁcantly shortens the circuit time but involves non-Cliﬀord gates,
and here as well, the bare quench circuits (J = 0.5236) are plagued by coherent error as shown in Fig. S4(a,b). For this
decomposition, we randomly sample twirling gates on the [control,target] pair from a subset GZZ ⊆G that commute
with RZZ(θ), GZZ = {[I, I], [X, X], [Y, Y ], [Z, Z]}. For every draw, the same set of twirling gates are applied before
and after the RZZ(θ), in order to implement the same unitary. Even with this very limited twirling set, we observe
very signiﬁcant improvements in the performance of our circuits, shown in Fig. S4(a,b). Indeed, it was shown [S61]
that for speciﬁc noise models it is suﬃcient to only twirl over a smaller subset of Pauli matrices to average out the
oﬀ-diagonal error.
A ﬁnal important consideration here has to do with the number of twirling instances. Our longest circuits at depth
60 employ 540 RZZ gates and with twirling gates sampled from GZZ for each RZZ, a natural question has to do with
the number of instances required to eﬀectively suppress our coherent errors. Remarkably in Fig. S4(c), for the native
decomposition and the quench dynamics with J = 0.5236, we see no further improvement in the Euclidean distance
from the ideal magnetization beyond a mere 8 twirled circuit instances.
C.
Noise model dependence of the identity insertion noise ampliﬁcation method
Following [S4] many error mitigation experiments [S22, S23, S39, S41] have used the idea of inserting identity
gates in to the circuit by repeating gates that square to the identity an odd number of times. The most frequently
considered example is the insertion of an odd number, e.g.
2k + 1, of CNOT gates.
This approach to noise
ampliﬁcation can be seen as an alternative to the stretching of gate times. The intent is to achieve an ampliﬁcation
of the noise parameter by a factor 2k + 1. A particular example where this can work is when the noisy gate is simply
given by a perfect CNOT gate preceded by a uniform 2 qubit depolarizing channel with depolarizing error ϵ. If we
write for the error (1 −ϵ) = exp(−λ) we see that the repeated application of the noisy gate acts on the depolarizing
error as (1 −ϵ)2k+1 which translates to the desired ampliﬁcation of the noise rate to (2k + 1)λ. The obvious appeal

gates.
Linear extrapolation is performed using stretched gates with c = 1, 1.6, and DD sequences are inserted for idling
qubits. All experiments employed a total of 60,000 shots, per stretch factor. The experimentally measured dynamics of the ⟨Z⟩
magnetization is compared to the ideal evolution, for a number of Pauli twirling (PT) instances, for individual qubits without
mitigation in a Q0 and c Q4. c For three diﬀerent trotter steps, the normalized Euclidean distance of the error mitigated
magnetization vector from the ideal vector dexp

the error-mitigated results in c are computed over 50 numerical experiments by bootstrapping the experiment data with the
identical number of shots.
of this approach lies in the fact that this method is considerably easier to implement in hardware than the stretching
of gates which need to be precisely calibrated. The gate insertion can be directly implemented on the circuit level
without any changes to the underlying experiment.
However, we caution that the method can provide noise ampliﬁcation results that arbitrarily deviate from the desired
result when only slightly more complicated noise models are considered. To provide a simple example, consider the
direct generalization of the 2- qubit depolarizing channel to a Pauli - error noise model. The Pauli channel Λ acts on
a state ρ by applying some Pauli matrix Pα ∈⟨1, Xi, Yi, Zi⟩i=1...n, where α denotes a 2n bit-string, with probability
qα. The Pauli channel is then given by
Λ(ρ) =
4n−1
X
α=0
qαPαρP †
α.
To closely resemble the depolarizing case above, we assume that this noise model is applied right before the CNOT
gate leading to a noise controlled-not gate described by the channel CNOT (ρ) = CNOT Λ(ρ) CNOT†. A convenient
property of the Pauli noise model that can be veriﬁed by direct computation, is that it acts on Pauli matrices by
multiplication. That is the Pauli matrices form an eigenbasis of the channel with eigenvalues µα. Hence, we have that
the channel acts as Λ(Pα) = Λ∗(Pα) = µαPα in both the Schroedinger Λ and Heisenberg Λ∗picture. The desired noise
ampliﬁcation procedure that is consistent with the extrapolation has to map for 2k + 1 applications the eigenvalues
µα to µ2k+1
α
. This does not happen for Pauli channels as we will see here. Since the CNOT gate is a Cliﬀord gate,
it maps Pauli matrices to other Pauli matrices so that CNOT Pα CNOT† = Pαcx where α and αcx are related by a
linear transformation determined by the CNOT gate. Let us now look at the expectation value of a Pauli matrix Pα
we want to mitigate. In the example here assume the expectation value is obtained by applying a single CNOT to an
initial state ρ0. We obtain
tr [PαCNOT (ρ0)] = µαcx tr [Pαcxρ0]
then following the identity insertion trick the noise is ampliﬁed to
tr

αcxµα tr [Pαcxρ0] .
The correct noise ampliﬁcation for zero noise extrapolation however asks that the noise is ampliﬁed by µαcx →µ3
αcx,
which is diﬀerent from µ2
αcxµα. For Pauli noise channels with non-uniform values of µα strong deviations from the

of Q23. The spectroscopy tracks the probability of excited state population (P1) at a ﬁxed T1 delay time of 20µs over a range
of Stark shifted frequencies, after an excited state is prepared [S33]. The bare qubit frequency is indicated as a red dotted line,
and data is collected every 6-7 hours to monitor temporal and spectral ﬂuctuations in P1. The quantum quench experiment
is carried out at two separate times, indicated by the vertical dotted lines. The impact of the TLS environment on the error

with c = 1, 1.3, 1.6, and DD sequences are inserted for idling qubits. All experiments employed a total of 100,000 shots, per

desired behavior can be constructed. This example shows that even for relatively simple and only slightly more realistic
noise channels the identity insertion method can provide an ampliﬁcation of the noise that can lead to uncontrolled
estimates when applying the zero noise extrapolation method.

Two level systems
An important challenge for the stability of our experiments in general, and the performance of zero-noise extrapo-
lation more speciﬁcally, is associated with resonant interactions of our qubits with defect two-level systems (TLSs),
that lead to ﬂuctuations in coherence
[S33, S62] and system performance. As recently shown for single-junction
transmons [S33], we map the TLS spectral environment and spectral dynamics in the vicinity of the qubit frequency
by measuring the qubit energy relaxation time T1 at ac-Stark shifted frequencies every 6-7 hours. In order to speed
up the spectroscopy, we use the excited state probability P1 at a ﬁxed delay time as a proxy for T1. We focus on
the TLS dynamics of a single qubit Q23 in Fig. S5(a) and correlate it with the performance of quench circuits for
J = 0.1. Blue regions in the Fig. S5(a) represent spectral dips in P1(T1) that correspond to TLS resonances. We focus
on circuit performance at two time instances, referred to trial 1 and trial 2. For trial 1, we see a strong TLS in the
spectral vicinity of the operating qubit frequency, and Fig. S5(b) shows the strongly suppressed coherent oscillations
in the quench dynamics, seen both in the c = 1 data as well as the mitigated result. The strongly inhomogeneous
noise proﬁle in the vicinity of the qubit frequency further complicates the performance of zero noise extrapolation
with CR gates. At the diﬀerent stretch factors, the driven control qubit is Stark shifted in frequency by diﬀerent
amounts, and this can potentially violate assumptions on time invariant noise. For instance, the control qubit Stark
shift during CR23-24 (control-target) operation for c = 1(= 1.6) is +9.71(+2.87) MHz. However, at instance trial 2,
the absence of a strongly coupled TLS leads to far improved performance in the raw, as well as the error mitigated
data, Fig. S5(c).

LOCAL WEIGHT-2 OBSERVABLES IN QUENCH DYNAMICS OF 2D ISING SPIN LATTICES
As discussed in the main text for the T1 and GHZ circuits, large weight and non-local observables can be increasingly
sensitive to noise, which in turn aﬀects the eﬃcacy of zero-noise extrapolation. While our results in Fig. 3 of the
main text focus on weight-1 observables for quench dynamics, this naturally raises the question of experimental
performance for higher weight observables as well. Here, we focus on ⟨ZZ⟩as an example of local, weight-2 observables.

We obtain the averaged local ZZ observable as ⟨ZZ⟩= P
⟨i,j⟩⟨ZiZj⟩/Nadj, where ⟨i, j⟩represents the adjacent
qubit pairs and Nadj = 27 is the total number of adjacent pairs for 26 qubits in the layout described in Fig. 3(a).
We measure an error of the obtained ⟨ZZ⟩from exact numerical results by deﬁning a relative error emethod
avg
=
|⟨ZZ⟩ideal −⟨ZZ⟩method|/|⟨ZZ⟩ideal|, where ⟨ZZ⟩method is obtained either from PEPS or error mitigated experiment.
Fig. S6 compares the relative PEPS error with the error mitigated experiment for J = 0.5236.
While the error
mitigated experiment provides better approximations for weight-1 observables as illustrated in Fig. 3(h-i) over PEPS
(D = 4), we do not observe such a deﬁnitive win for weight-2, local ⟨ZZ⟩expectation values that are increasingly
sensitive to noise in the circuit than their weight-1 counterparts.
