1. Introduction
With increasing attention on climate change, the fixation and
transformation of carbon dioxide (CO2), a greenhouse gas, has
become a hot topic for chemical researchers.[1–6] CO2 is a one-
carbon (C1) source that is nontoxic, nonflammable, renewable,
abundant, and inexpensive. The use of CO2 instead of toxic
phosgene or CO in organic synthesis has high value in research
and development.[7–13] Unfortunately, the high thermodynamic
stability and kinetic inertness of CO2 make its chemical trans-
formation very difficult. To solve this problem, the classical
method is to trap it with highly reactive compounds, such as
Grignard or organolithium reagents. However, this method has
poor functional group compatibility and requires strictly anhy-
drous and anaerobic conditions. To address these problems,
CO2 fixation processes with less reactive organometallic re-
agents (such as boron or zinc reagents) or halogenated hydro-
carbons have been developed in recent years.[14] However,
these methods require prefunctionalization of the substrate,
and also produce needless waste, and thus, fail to meet the re-
quirements of green and sustainable chemistry. Although tran-
sition-metal-catalyzed reductive carboxylation of unsaturated
hydrocarbons partially solves the problem of substrate pre-
functionalization, these reactions still generally require stoi-
chiometric or even excessive amounts of reductants, such as
organozinc reagents, aluminum reagents, or hydrosilanes.[15,16]
The functionalization of C@H bonds is an important method
for
constructing
carbon–carbon
and
carbon–heteroatom
bonds in organic chemistry.[17–21] In light of its high atom and
step economy, C@H bond functionalization demonstrates a
wide range of application in the syntheses of pharmaceuticals,
natural products, and organic materials.[22–24] The use of ubiqui-
tous C@H bonds to react with CO2 is an ideal way to produce
high value-added chemicals. Key to achieving this goal is to
combine the selective activation and functionalization of inert
C@H bonds with the activation of CO2. Organized according to
the types of C@H bond involved in the reaction, this review
summarizes recent progress in the functionalization of C@H
bonds with CO2 as a carboxylative reagent. We note that some
published reviews cover part of contents in this paper. For ex-
ample, C@H carboxylation of aromatic compounds through
CO2 fixation has been reviewed recently.[3] The direct carboxy-
lation of C(sp3)@H and C(sp2)@H bonds with CO2 by transition-
metal-catalyzed and base-mediated reactions has also been
surveyed.[25] However, some important aspects, including sever-
al specific types of C@H carboxylation reactions, transition-
metal-free reactions (including Lewis acid mediated reactions),
multicomponent reactions, tandem reactions, and key theoreti-
cal studies related to the carboxylation of C@H bonds, are
overlooked. To this end, it is highly desirable to thoroughly
summarize the field of C@H carboxylation with CO2. By doing
so, we can find many interesting points, which will enhance
our understanding of this exciting field. For example, many
transition-metal-catalyzed C@H carboxylation reactions with
CO2 (including C(sp)@H bonds and C(sp2)@H bonds) can be de-
veloped into transition-metal-free versions (see Sections 2.2.4
and 3.1.1.2., and Scheme 56); copper can catalyze all types of
C@H carboxylation reactions with CO2 (e.g., see Sections 2.1.1,
2.2.1, 2.3, and 3.1.1.1, and Schemes 71 and 78); bases can me-
diate all types of C@H carboxylation reactions for substrates
with relatively acidic C@H bonds (e.g., see Sections 2.2.4,
3.1.1.2, and 3.3 and Schemes 68 and 73); and all types of C@H
carboxylation reactions can be incorporated into tandem or se-
quential reactions (e.g., see Section 2.3 and Schemes 45, 55,
and 70).
2. Carboxylation of C(sp)@H Bonds with CO2
2.1. Carboxylative coupling reaction of terminal alkynes,
alkyl halides, and CO2
2.1.1. Copper(I)-catalyzed carboxylative coupling reaction of
terminal alkynes, alkyl halides, and CO2
In 1994, Inoue and co-workers found that CuI (CuI/CuBr) or AgI
salts (AgI/AgNO3) could catalyze the carboxylative coupling of
terminal alkynes, alkyl bromides, and CO2 (Scheme 1).[26] The
choice of solvent and base has a significant effect on the reac-
tion. Polar aprotic solvents, such as N,N-dimethylformamide
Carbon dioxide is a nontoxic, renewable, and abundant C1
source, whereas C@H bond functionalization represents one of
the most important approaches to the construction of carbon–
carbon bonds and carbon–heteroatom bonds in an atom- and
step-economical manner. Combining the chemical transforma-
tion of CO2 with C@H bond functionalization is of great impor-
tance in the synthesis of carboxylic acids and their derivatives.
The contents of this Review are organized according to the
type of C@H bond involved in carboxylation. The primary types
of C@H bonds are as follows: C(sp)@H bonds of terminal al-
kynes, C(sp2)@H bonds of (hetero)arenes, vinylic C(sp2)@H
bonds, the ipso-C(sp2)@H bonds of the diazo group, aldehyde
C(sp2)@H bonds, a-C(sp3)@H bonds of the carbonyl group, g-
C(sp3)@H bonds of the carbonyl group, C(sp3)@H bonds adja-
cent to nitrogen atoms, C(sp3)@H bonds of o-alkyl phenyl ke-
tones, allylic C(sp3)@H bonds, C(sp3)@H bonds of methane, and
C(sp3)@H bonds of halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbons. In ad-
dition, multicomponent reactions, tandem reactions, and key
theoretical studies related to the carboxylation of C@H bonds
are briefly summarized. Transition-metal-free, organocatalytic,
electrochemical, and light-driven methods are highlighted.

(DMF), dimethylacetamide (DMA), and N-methylpyrrolidone
(NMP), are suitable for this reaction. Employment of organic
bases, such as triethylamine or 8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-
ene (DBU), suffers from alkylation of the base with alkyl halide.
Thus, an inorganic salt, such as K2CO3, is used as the base.
A three-step reaction mechanism is proposed: 1) copper acety-
lide formation, 2) CO2 insertion into the carbon–copper bond,
and 3) esterification with bromoalkane and regeneration of the
copper salt catalyst (Scheme 1). Based on the above work, Oi
and co-workers reported the CuI-catalyzed polymerization of
diyne, CO2, and dihaloalkane in 1996.[27] The use of 1,10-phe-
nanthroline as a ligand accelerates polymerization.
In 2010, Lu and co-workers reported the carboxylative cou-
pling of terminal alkynes, allylic chlorides, and CO2 catalyzed
by an N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) copper(I) complex, [(IPr)-
CuCl] (Scheme 2).[28] They found that the use of NHC ligands
significantly increased the catalytic activity and selectivity. In
addition to allylic chlorides, propargylic chlorides, benzyl chlor-
ides, and a-chlorocarbonyl compounds can all participate in
the reaction. Catalyst recovery can be achieved by means of
column chromatography. In 2014, Yuan and Lin[29] conducted a
DFT study on the [(IPr)CuCl]-catalyzed carboxylative coupling
reaction of terminal alkynes, allyl chloride, and CO2 reported
by Lu and co-workers.[28] It was found that both the reactions
of (IPr)Cu@C/CPh and (IPr)CuOCOC/CPh with an allylic chlo-
ride occurred through an SN2 substitution pathway. They also
revealed how the reaction conditions affected the preference
of one pathway over the other (carboxylative coupling versus
cross coupling).
In 2012, Kondo and co-workers found that the CuI/PEt3
system could catalyze carboxylative coupling reactions of ter-
minal alkynes, haloalkane, and CO2 under mild conditions
(Scheme 3).[30] For some relatively inert terminal alkynes, such
as 4-cyanophenylacetylene, higher yields could be obtained by
using the CuI/2,2’-bipyridine catalyst system, while heating to
508C. For substrates such as 4-nitrophenylacetylene, the reac-
tion results are unsatisfactory.
In 2015, He and co-workers reported a CuI-based ionic-
liquid-catalyzed carboxylation of terminal alkynes with CO2
(Scheme 4).[31] For terminal alkynes with electron-withdrawing
groups, increasing the reaction temperature to 408C could sig-
nificantly improve the yield.
The most commonly used solvents in the carboxylative cou-
pling reactions of terminal alkynes, haloalkanes, and CO2 are
DMF and DMA. However, these solvents are often environmen-
tally unfriendly. In 2013, He and co-workers found that ethyl-
ene carbonate (EC) was an ideal solvent for the carboxylative
coupling reaction of terminal alkynes (Scheme 5a).[32] EC has
the advantages of strong solubility and low toxicity. DFT calcu-
lations show that the use of EC as a solvent can greatly reduce
the energy barrier for CO2 insertion into the Cu@C(sp) bond.
EC was thought to act as a potential ligand because the reac-
tion does not require any external ligands. Based on this work,
He and co-workers further developed a carboxylative coupling
reaction of terminal alkynes catalyzed by CuBr supported on
activated carbon (Scheme 5b).[33] This reaction also used EC as
a solvent. A hot filtration experiment demonstrates that this re-
action most likely occurs on the surface of a heterogeneous
catalyst, which can be reused at least five times without sub-
stantial inactivation. Notably, in the second and third reuse
cycles, the catalyst performed slightly better than the freshly
prepared catalyst. A possible reason for these results was pro-
posed according to X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
characterization: Divalent copper species on the surface of the
catalyst may be reduced to monovalent copper under the re-
action conditions.
2.1.2. Silver(I)-catalyzed carboxylative coupling reaction of ter-
minal alkynes, alkyl halides, and CO2
In 2012, based on their previous work,[34] Lu and co-workers
also reported carboxylative coupling reactions of terminal al-
kynes, chlorides, and CO2 catalyzed by AgI (Scheme 6a).[35] The
amount of used AgI could be as low as 0.1 mol%. Kinetic stud-
ies demonstrated that the activity of the 0.1 mol% AgI/Cs2CO3
catalytic system was significantly better than the previously re-
ported 10 mol% [(IPr)CuCl]/K2CO3 system. Furthermore, in
2013, Lu and co-workers realized the sequential AgI-catalyzed
carboxylative coupling/Ru-catalyzed cross-metathesis reactions
for the synthesis of functionalized 2-alkynoates (Scheme 6b).[36]
In 2015, He and co-workers reported the carboxylative cou-
pling reaction of terminal alkyne, n-butyl iodide, and CO2 cata-
lyzed by Ag2WO4 (Scheme 7a).[37] The reaction can be carried
out under very mild conditions: room temperature, 1 atm of

CO2, without using any external ligands. The authors believed
that the catalyst was bifunctional: silver(I) activates the C/C
bond, whereas the tungstate anion activates CO2, as verified
by
13C NMR spectroscopy. In addition, they also successfully
achieved the one-pot sequential phenylacetylene carboxylative
coupling and hydroamination reaction (Scheme 7b).

2.1.3. Gold(I)-catalyzed carboxylative coupling reaction of ter-
minal alkynes, alkyl halides, and CO2
In 2008, Anastas and co-workers found that AuI could catalyze
the carboxylative coupling of phenylacetylene, 1-bromo-2-pen-
tyne, and CO2 to give 1,6-diyne (Scheme 8).[38]
2.2. Carboxylation of terminal alkynes with CO2
2.2.1. Copper(I)-catalyzed carboxylation of terminal alkynes
with CO2
In 2010, the groups of Gooßen[39] and Zhang[40] almost simulta-
neously reported the catalytic carboxylation of terminal al-
kynes catalyzed by CuI complexes. In the report by Gooßen
et al.,[39] it was necessary to use different catalytic systems for
aromatic and aliphatic alkynes (Scheme 9). Ethers, halogens,
the trifluoromethyl group, and the alkenyl group are all com-
patible, whereas unprotected amino group and hydroxyl
group are not. In the report by Zhang and Yu,[40] the choice of
ligand, base, and temperature has a large influence on the re-
action outcome (Scheme 10). Interestingly, they found that, by
using the CuCl/tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA) system,
the reaction proceeded in the absence of any basic additives.
For most terminal alkynes, good yields can be obtained with
the CuCl–TMEDA system. For very inert 4-nitrophenylacetylene,
use of the CuCl–TMEDA system gives lower yields, whereas
using poly-N-heterocyclic carbenes (PNHCs) as ligands gives
good results. The scope of substrates for the reaction is wide
and the conditions are mild (RT, 1 atm of CO2). It is worth men-

tioning that, if the ratio of CuCl and PNHC ligands is 1:2, the
performance of the P(NHC)0.5(NHC–Cu)0.5 catalyst is better than
that of the catalyst with a ratio of 3:2. This result shows that
the free carbene species in the catalyst plays an important role
in the reaction. It is proposed that the key to extremely high
catalytic activity is that organic (NHC) and organometallic cata-
lysts operate synergistically in one system. In 2014, Zhang and
co-workers investigated the possible mechanism of the carbox-
ylation of terminal alkynes with CO2, as catalyzed by CuI–NHC
complexes, and the role of NHC through DFT calculations.[41]
In 2015, Trivedi and co-workers reported the carboxylation
of terminal alkynes with CO2 catalyzed by a ferrocene-based
bis-phosphine ligand and CuI (complex C; Scheme 11).[42] The
structure of catalyst C was confirmed by single-crystal X-ray
diffraction.
In 2017, Beletskaya and co-workers first used Al2O3-support-
ed copper particles to catalyze the direct carboxylation of vari-
ous terminal alkynes with CO2.[43] The catalyst is heterogene-
ous, highly active, easily available, and recyclable.
In 2018, Gooßen and co-workers reported the salt-free,
copper-catalyzed carboxylation of terminal alkynes with CO2
(Scheme 12).[44] The reaction utilizes a copper(I) catalyst, which
enables the insertion of CO2 into alkyne C@H bonds by using
TMP as the base. The ammonium alkynecarboxylate can be hy-
drogenated to the primary alcohol and water by a rhodium/
molybdenum catalyst, regenerating the amine base.
2.2.2. Silver(I)-catalyzed carboxylation of terminal alkynes
with CO2
In 2011, Lu and co-workers reported an AgI-catalyzed direct
carboxylation of terminal alkynes with CO2 (Scheme 13a).[34]
The optimal amount of AgI was 1 mol%; increasing the
amount of catalyst to 20 mol% decreased the yield. It was rea-
soned that the catalyst could promote both carboxylation and
decarboxylation reactions. This reaction does not require any
external ligands, which will reduce the product yield instead.
In 2014, Luo and co-workers studied the mechanism of silver-

through DFT calculations.[45] The calculated results show that
the true catalytically active species is a CsCO3
@-coordinated Ag
complex, rather than neutral alkynyl silver species. Through
theoretical calculations, they also explained the experimentally
observed inhibition of the reaction by organic ligands. In 2012,
Gooßen and co-workers reported a catalytic system analogous
to that reported by Lu and co-workers (Scheme 13b).[46] In
their report, the amount of AgI catalyst used was as low as
500 ppm. In 2014, Hong and co-workers found that combusted
exhaust gas could be used for organic reactions related to CO2
after capturing CO2 in an aqueous solution of ethanolamine.[47]
By successfully combining the capture and utilization of CO2,
this strategy was applied to the direct carboxylation of termi-
nal alkynes catalyzed by AgI (Scheme 13c). Similar results were
obtained by using CO2 in combusted exhaust gas and by di-
rectly using hyperpure CO2. Notably, although the aqueous so-
lution of ethanolamine was reused 55 times, the yield of the
reaction was still not significantly reduced.
In 2014, Jover and Maseras used DFT calculations to study
the mechanism of the copper-, silver-, and gold-catalyzed car-
boxylation of terminal alkynes with CO2.[48] They found that the
catalytic systems for these three metals all experienced similar
reaction pathways: coordination of alkyne and metal, deproto-
nation with an external base, and nucleophilic attack on the
CO2 molecule by the metal–acetylide complex.
In 2016, Zhou and co-workers reported the carboxylation of
terminal alkynes with CO2 catalyzed by the AgI–NHC complex
(Scheme 14).[49]
In 2012, Zhang and co-workers developed a PNHC-support-
ed silver nanoparticle (NP) catalyst system[50] based on their
previous work.[40] Similar to the CuI–PNHC system, this system
can also efficiently catalyze the carboxylation of terminal al-
kynes at room temperature under 1 atm of CO2. A mechanism
involving similar synergistic effects of organic (NHC) and or-
ganometallic catalysts was proposed. As a heterogeneous cata-
lytic system, the catalyst can be easily recovered and reused.
Later, they developed the NHC–Ag/Pd-catalyzed reductive car-
boxylation of terminal alkynes with CO2 and H2.[51] In 2014, Fi-
nashina and co-workers reported an Ag/F-Al2O3-catalyzed car-
boxylation of phenylacetylene with CO2 in 62.1% yield.[52]
In 2015, Cheng and co-workers reported the carboxylation
of terminal alkynes with CO2 catalyzed by Ag@MIL-101 (silver
NPs supported by the metal–organic framework (MOF) MIL-
101).[53] The dual-functional catalytic material can achieve CO2
capture and high-efficiency conversion at the same time at
508C under 1 atm of CO2. As a heterogeneous catalyst,
Ag@MIL-101 can be easily separated from the reaction solution
by means of centrifugation. This catalyst can be reused at least
five times without significant reduction in catalytic activity. The
authors believed that the larger pore size of the MOF carrier fa-
vored the diffusion of metal precursor, AgNO3, and the deposi-
tion of Ag NPs. In addition, the MOF carrier also plays an im-
portant role in the efficient performance of the catalytic reac-
tion: it is an excellent material for the adsorption of CO2 and

can increase the local CO2 concentration in the catalytic
center; the framework and pores can be used as a “microreac-
tor” to provide a favorable reaction environment; the MOF
structure can also stabilize the overall catalytic material. Bhau-
mik and co-workers reported the carboxylation of terminal al-
kynes with CO2 catalyzed by Ag NPs supported over a bivalent
cobalt-based MOF carrier.[54] In 2017, Ma and co-workers uti-
lized Ag@MIL-100(Fe) and Ag@UIO-66(Zr) materials for the cap-
ture and transformation of CO2 into alkynyl carboxylic acids.[55]
The influence of such Ag@MOF systems on the catalytic activi-
ty was compared and discussed systematically. The authors
supposed that the acid–base properties of the MOF influenced
the catalytic activity of the Ag@MOF system significantly.
Stronger Lewis acidity favors the adsorption of aromatic sub-
strates and activation of the C/C group, whereas stronger
Lewis basicity is beneficial for the capture of CO2 and loading
of the Ag NPs. Many other silver-catalyzed examples have
been developed in recent years.[56–63]
2.2.3. Other metal-catalyzed carboxylation of terminal alkynes
with CO2
In 2015, Yao and co-workers reported the direct carboxylation
of terminal alkynes with CO2, as catalyzed by rare-earth-metal
complexes (Scheme 15).[64] The structures of the three rare-
earth metal complexes were confirmed by means of single-
crystal X-ray diffraction. Among the three rare-earth metal
complexes, Nd-based catalyst D showed the best activity. Phe-
nylacetylene substrates with either electron-donating or -with-
drawing groups afforded the product in high yields, whereas
aliphatic alkynes failed to deliver the expected product. The
mechanism was proposed to be similar to that of monovalent
copper or silver salt catalysts.
In 2016, Trivedi and co-workers reported the carboxylation
of terminal alkynes with CO2 catalyzed by MIL-101-supported
bimetallic Pd@Cu nanocrystals.[65]
In 2018, Cheng and co-workers investigated the triply
bonded dimolybdenum compound Mo2(OtBu)6 as a homoge-
neous catalyst for the carboxylation of terminal alkynes with
CO2 (Scheme 16).[66] For the carboxylation of diethynylben-
zenes, asymmetric compounds were selectively obtained. No-
tably, this is the first report of the application of a metal–
metal-bond-containing species in the catalytic conversion of
CO2.
2.2.4. Transition-metal-free carboxylation of terminal alkynes
with CO2
In 2001, DuÇach and co-workers employed electrochemical
methods to convert terminal alkynes and CO2 into alkynyl car-
boxylic acids.[67] For a,w-diynes, this method can selectively
give monocarboxylated products.
In 2011, Zhang and Yu reported the direct carboxylation of
terminal alkynes with CO2 promoted by Cs2CO3 (Scheme 17).[68]
They found that the reaction temperature and pressure had a
significant effect on the reaction outcome: high temperature
might cause decarboxylation side reactions; CO2 pressure was
positively correlated with reaction rate. Both aromatic and ali-
phatic alkynes could undergo the carboxylation reaction
smoothly. In 2013, Lee and co-workers reported the direct car-
boxylation of terminal alkynes with CO2 mediated by 1,5,7-tria-
zabicyclo[4.4.0]dec-5-ene (TBD).[69] If acetylene is used as the

used to produce some biodegradable polymers (such as poly-
butylene succinate).
Similar to EC, supercritical CO2 is also a green reaction
medium. In 2014, Han and co-workers found that DBU could
promote the reaction in supercritical CO2 (Scheme 18).[70] In ad-
dition to facilitating deprotonation of the terminal alkyne, DBU
may also play a role in capturing CO2. The authors also report-
ed that the carboxylation of terminal alkynes could be cata-
lyzed by CuI[70] or AgOAc[71] in supercritical CO2 (Scheme 18).
The group of Liu has also developed a CsF-promoted carboxy-
lation of aryl(heteroaryl) terminal alkynes with 1 atm CO2,[72]
and a sequential silylation and carboxylation strategy.[73]
2.3. Application of carboxylation of terminal al-
kynes with CO2 in the multicomponent synthesis
of heterocycles
Compared with traditional multistep synthesis, multi-
component reactions avoid the requirement for the
separation and purification of intermediates, which
has the advantages of significantly shortening the re-
action time and reducing waste generation. In recent
years, considerable efforts have been made toward
multicomponent reactions of CO2.
In 2008, Anastas and co-workers reported AgI-cat-
alyzed multicomponent reactions of phenylacety-
lene, propargylic bromide, and CO2.[38] The 1,6-diyne
produced by the carboxylative coupling reaction can
afford
an
aryl
naphthalene
lactone
through
a
[2+2+2] cyclization reaction (Scheme 19). In 2010, further im-
provements were made to this reaction,[74] and this approach
has also been employed in the synthesis of six arylnaphthalene
lactone natural products.[75]
In 2014, Meller and co-workers reported the carboxylation–
methylation–Michael addition–cyclocondensation of terminal
alkynes catalyzed by [Cu(PPh3)3NO3] (Scheme 20).[76] The multi-
component reaction can produce pyrimidones or 3-hydroxy-
pyrazoles without isolation and purification of the intermediate
propiolate. In 2015, He and co-workers reported CuCl/PPh3-cat-
alyzed
carboxylation–cyclization
of
terminal
alkynes
(Scheme 21).[77] PPh3 is not only the ligand for the carboxyla-
tion step, but also the catalyst for the second cyclization step.
In 2016, Meller and co-workers merged the copper-catalyzed
carboxylation–propargylation of terminal alkynes with azido–
alkyne cycloaddition to obtain a functionalized 1,2,3-triazole.[78]
At the same time, they also found that the above four-compo-
nent reaction could be further integrated with a Michael reac-
tion to develop a five-component reaction (Scheme 22). Similar
to the reaction reported by Meller and co-workers[78], in 2016,
Pan and co-workers reported a copper-catalyzed carboxylative
coupling/cycloaddition of terminal alkynes, 1,2-dibromoethane,
CO2, and sodium azide (Scheme 23).[79]

In 2016, Pan and co-workers reported a multicom-
ponent heterocyclic synthesis reaction of terminal al-
kynes, a-haloketones, and CO2 based on capture
and utilization of CO2 (Scheme 24).[80] An aqueous
solution of morpholine can be used as an adsorbent
to directly capture CO2 from air. The authors be-
lieved that this reaction proceeded through copper-
catalyzed carboxylative coupling and a base-mediat-
ed acyl shift/cyclization/decarbonylation sequence.
2.4. Application of carboxylation of terminal al-
kynes with CO2 in the hydrothiolation of alkynes
Transition-metal-catalyzed hydrothiolation of alkynes
is an important method for the synthesis of vinyl sul-
fides. This reaction faces challenges of regio- and
stereoselectivity. In 2012, Zhang and co-workers
found that the stereoselectivity of the reaction could
be modulated by changing the atmosphere under
which the reaction was performed (Scheme 25).[81] Z-Vinyl sul-
fides could be stereoselectively obtained under a CO2 atmos-
phere, whereas E-vinyl sulfides were mainly obtained under
argon or air. A small amount of water can speed up the reac-
tion. A possible reaction mechanism was proposed: in the CO2
atmosphere, the terminal alkynes could be converted into pro-
piolate, and then a stereoselective decarboxylative hydrothiola-
tion reaction occurred. Finally, the Z-vinyl sulfide was selective-
ly obtained.

the catalyst has a low turnover number (TON) (for

simple arenes with CO2 (Scheme 26).[84] The use of bulky biden-
tate phosphine ligands and addition of TMU as a cosolvent
may serve to stabilize the coordinatively unsaturated RhI spe-
cies. Both electron-rich and -deficient arenes can participate in
this reaction (for benzene, TON=37). Steric hindrance has a
great influence on the regioselectivity of this reaction. For ben-
zofuran and 1-methylindole, the reaction occurs selectively at
the C-2 position. The reaction mechanism proposed was simi-
lar to that reported in previous work.[83] In 2017, Iwasawa and
co-workers studied the mechanism of rhodium-catalyzed car-
boxylation of simple aromatic compounds with CO2.[85] Four-
teen-electron complexes, [RhMe(dcype)] and [RhPh(dcype)]
(dcype=1,2-bis(dicyclohexylphosphino)ethane), participated in
the C@H bond activation and carboxylation steps, respectively.
Interestingly, the undesired carboxylation of [RhMe(dcype)] to
give acetic acid was found to be much faster than that of the
desired C@H bond activation reaction under stoichiometric
conditions; however, C@H bond activation reaction could
occur under catalytic conditions.
In 2012, Leitner and co-workers studied the direct carboxyla-
tion of C@H bonds of unactivated arenes (such as benzene)
with CO2 by means of DFT calculations.[86] Their study showed
that some ruthenium pincer complexes could catalyze the re-
action theoretically, and the predicted catalyst turnover fre-
quency (TOF) could be up to 105–107 h@1. In 2014, they con-
ducted further research into the effect of the spatial configura-
tion of the ruthenium pincer complexes on catalysis by means
of DFT calculations.[87]
In 2010, Nolan and Boogaerts reported the carboxylation of
electron-deficient heterocycles and aromatic rings catalyzed by
an AuI–NHC complex, [(IPr)AuOH] (Scheme 27).[88] The reaction
occurs at the most acidic C@H bond regioselectively. For the
carboxylation of weakly acidic C@H bonds, such as N-methyli-
midazole and N-methylbenzimidazole, it is necessary to use a
more basic catalyst: [(ItBu)AuOH]. Catalyst recovery can be
achieved by simple extraction. The authors isolated and char-
acterized the reaction intermediates (Scheme 28), and applied
the intermediates to catalytic carboxylation. Thus, a possible
reaction mechanism was proposed. Notably, in 2011, based on
their experimental and theoretical calculations, Wendt and co-
workers[89] questioned the mechanism of [(IPr)AuOH]-catalyzed
carboxylation of electron-deficient (hetero)aromatics proposed
by Nolan and Boogaerts. In 2012, Geng and co-workers con-
ducted theoretical studies on the mechanism of oxa-
zole with CO2 catalyzed by AuI–NHC complexes.[90] In
2010, the groups of Hou[91] and Nolan[92] individually
reported similar carboxylations of electron-deficient
heterocycles or aromatic rings catalyzed by a CuI–
NHC complex. Hou and co-workers used [Cu(IPr)Cl]
as a catalyst and potassium tert-butoxide (1.1 equiv)
as the base (Scheme 29a).[91] The substrate scope
covers various substituted benzoxazoles. The yields
of less acidic N-methylbenzimidazoles and 1,3,4-oxa-
diazoles are lower, whereas benzothiazole, 4-phenyl-
oxazole, and benzofuran give only trace amounts of
carboxylated products. Similar to the [(IPr)AuOH] cat-
alytic system reported by Nolan and Boogaerts,[88]
Hou and co-workers also isolated and characterized
key
intermediates
for
their
reactions
(including
single-crystal
X-ray
diffraction),
and
proved
that
these key intermediates could catalyze the carboxyla-
tion of benzoxazoles. The reaction mechanism they
proposed was similar to that of the [(IPr)AuOH] cata-
lytic system reported by Nolan and Boogaerts.[88]

lyzed by CuI–NHC complexes by means of DFT calcu-

ferent from that of Hou and co-workers: it is energetically
more favorable for a metal-stabilized carbene intermediate to
react with CO2 to give carboxylated products (Scheme 30). The
[Cu(IPr)OH]-CsOH system reported by Nolan and co-workers
can be applied to the carboxylation of benzoxazole, benzothia-
zole, oxazole, 1,2,4-trifluorobenzene, and 1,2,4,5-tetrafluoro-
benzene (Scheme 29b).[92] For 1,2,4,5-tetrafluoroben-
zene, mono- and dicarboxylation can be modulated
by controlling the amount of base. In 2010, consid-
ering that benzoxazole has similar acidity to that of
terminal alkynes, Gooßen and co-workers applied
their copper-complex catalytic system to the carbox-
ylation of benzoxazole.[39] In 2012, Fukuzawa and co-
workers reported the carboxylation of electron-defi-
cient benzoxazoles and benzothiazoles catalyzed by
1,2,3-triazole-derived CuI–NHC complexes, [(TPr)CuCl]
(Scheme 31).[94] Compared with the [Cu(IPr)Cl] cata-
lyst used by Hou and co-workers, [(TPr)CuCl] has
higher catalytic activity.
In 2017, Hong and co-workers developed diethylene glycol
functionalized imidazo[1,5-a]pyridin-3-ylidenes (DEG-ImPy) bi-
functional NHC ligands.[95] DEG-ImPy CuI complexes can effi-
ciently catalyze the direct C@H carboxylation of benzoxazole
with CO2, leading to the isolation of products in higher yields
than those obtained with the [(IPr)CuCl] catalyst (Scheme 32).
Catalyst recovery is a problem that limits the wide applica-
tion of homogeneous catalysis. In 2013, Li and co-workers re-
ported the carboxylation of benzoxazole derivatives catalyzed
by a pH-responsive CuI–NHC complex, E (Scheme 33).[96] Unlike
the [Cu(IPr)Cl] catalyst used by Hou and co-workers,[91] a basic
tertiary amine functionality was introduced into the catalyst re-
ported by Li and co-workers. This type of catalyst is soluble
under basic carboxylation conditions. However, if HCl diethyl
ether is added after the reaction, the protonated salt of the
catalyst will precipitate from solution. The catalyst can be sepa-

Additionally, if new substrates and bases are added to the re-
covered catalyst, the protonated catalyst can be regenerated
in the form of a neutral homogeneous catalyst. Moreover, the
catalyst can be used four times without a significant drop in
catalytic activity. This catalyst can also be used to catalyze the
carboxylation of organoboronic esters,
whereas a similar
AgI–NHC catalyst can catalyze the carboxylation of terminal al-
kynes.
In 2018, Cheng and co-workers reported the carboxylation

Mo2(OtBu)6 (Scheme 34).[66]
3.1.1.2. Transition-metal-free, chelation-free carboxylation of
C(sp2)@H bonds of (hetero)arenes with CO2
The Kolbe–Schmitt reaction[97] is one of the most important
carboxylation reactions, which refers to the direct ortho-C@H
carboxylation of phenoxide with CO2. This reaction is em-
ployed for the industrial synthesis of salicylic acid. In 2014, Lar-
rosa and co-workers reported a one-pot, direct, meta-selective
arylation reaction of phenol by using a traceless directing
group relay strategy (Scheme 35).[98] They first exploited the
ortho-/para-directing nature of phenol to react with CO2 to
generate ortho- or para-substituted carboxylic acids (Kolbe–
Schmitt reaction), followed by CO2H group-directed ortho-C@H
arylation reaction and decarboxylation of carboxylic acids, and
finally a phenol meta-arylated product was produced. In this
process, CO2 acts as a traceless directing group. Notably, re-
gardless of the regioselectivity of the carboxylation reaction
(ortho or para), the meta-aryl phenol products can be finally
obtained. The Kolbe–Schmitt reaction generally requires harsh
reaction conditions: high CO2 pressure (20–100 atm) and high
temperature (130–2808C). In 2016, Larrosa and co-workers first
reported a Kolbe–Schmitt reaction that could be performed at
atmospheric pressure (Scheme 36).[99] The use of 2,4,6-trime-
thylphenol as a recyclable additive is key to the success of this
reaction. This method avoids the separation of phenoxides and
has a broader range of substrates. The authors believe that
2,4,6-trimethylphenol in the reaction may facilitate CO2 cap-

ture. In addition, enzymatic Kolbe–Schmitt reactions have also
been reported.[100–105] For example, in 2012, Faber and co-work-
ers found that different types of enzymes could modulate
the
regioselectivity
of
p-hydroxystyrene
carboxylation
(Scheme 37).[101] In 2016, Zhu and co-workers found that the
addition of quaternary ammonium salt to the reaction system
could shift the equilibrium of the enzymatic Kolbe–Schmitt re-
action towards carboxylation.[105] The precipitation capacity of
the quaternary ammonium salt of the carboxylation product is
the driving force for the shift of the reaction equilibrium.
In 1995, Kudo and co-workers reported the carboxylation of
alkali-metal 2-naphthoate with high-pressure CO2 (400 atm)
promoted by molten alkali-metal carbonate and formate.[106] In
2010, Hu and co-workers found that Cs2CO3 could facilitate
C@H bond carboxylation of some aromatic heterocycles, such
as benzothiazole, benzoxazole, 5-phenyl oxazole, and 2-aryl-
1,3,4-oxadiazole (Scheme 38), without the use of any transi-
tion-metal catalysts.[107] They proposed the following reaction
mechanism: first, the most acidic C@H bond in the aromatic
heterocycle is cleaved with Cs2CO3, and the resulting anion
reacts with CO2 to form a new C@C bond (Scheme 38). In 2016,
Kanan and co-workers reported the direct carboxylation of the
C@H
bond
of
2-furoic
acid
promoted
by
carbonate
(Scheme 39).[108] 2-Furoic acid can be easily obtained from
lignocellulose. FDCA produced through the carboxylation of 2-
furoic acid has wide applications. For example, it can be used
to synthesize polyethylene furandicarboxylate (PEF); a substi-
tute for petroleum-derived polyethylene terephthalate (PET). It
is believed that CO3
2@ in the molten salts of Cs2CO3 or K2CO3
can deprotonate furan-2-carboxylate, whereas the high con-
centration of alkali-metal cations can stabilize the conjugate
base through ion pairing. If the CO3

lation reaction is combined with protonation of the carboxy-

transformation of the C@H bond and CO2 into C@CO2H. In addi-

ers also examined C@H carboxylation of cesium 2-thiophene

Fenner and Ackermann[109] reported a heterocyclic C@H bond
carboxylation reaction similar to that of Hu and co-workers[107]

mann used potassium tert-butoxide as the base to make the

In 2002, Miyano and co-workers reported the direct carboxy-
lation of naphthalene, anthracene, and phenanthrene with CO2
promoted by AlBr3 (2 equiv).[110] In 2002, Olah and co-workers
found that the Al2Cl6/Al system promoted the direct carboxyla-
tion
of
benzene
or
substituted
benzene
with
CO2
(Scheme 42).[111] For mesitylene, the reaction can be performed
at 208C. For some alkylbenzenes (such as ethylbenzene, tert-
butylbenzene, and p-xylene), side reactions, such as isomeriza-
tion or disproportionation, lead to a decrease in product yield.
The addition of metallic aluminum can significantly increase
the yield and selectivity of the reaction. The authors believe
that the role of aluminum may be to react with HCl generated
in the carboxylation reaction to suppress other side reactions,
and, at the same time, generate part of aluminum chloride in
situ. Based on experimental and theoretical calculations, they
proposed the following reaction mechanism. Aluminum chlo-
ride can electrophilically activate CO2, and then electrophilic
substitution occurs on the aromatic ring. Hattori and co-work-
ers have done a great deal of work on the electrophilic carbox-
ylation of aromatic rings with CO2.[112–114] For example, they
found that using AlBr3 and R3SiCl together could significantly
promote the direct carboxylation of aromatics.[113] Also, this
system solves the disproportionation problem that often
occurs in the carboxylation of ethylbenzene and tert-butylben-
zene.[111] In 2012, the groups of Meller[115] and Hattori[114] inde-
pendently reported the carboxylation of aromatics with CO2
mediated by a silyl cation. In 2009, Munshi and Beckman
found that prereacting CO2 with a Lewis acid before adding
toluene could promote the carboxylation of toluene.[116] This
phenomenon is consistent with the mechanism proposed by
Olah and co-workers.[111] In 2010, Munshi and co-workers ach-
ieved a catalytic cycle with Al2Cl6 in the carboxylation of tolu-
ene through the rational selection of fluorine-containing sol-
vents and bases.[117] In 2012, Munshi and co-workers further
studied the kinetics of carboxylation of toluene.[118] In 2014, Gu
and Cheng reported the carboxylation of toluene promoted by
aluminum-supported aluminum chloride.[119] In 2017, Cheng
and Zhang further showed that the addition of silica com-
pounds could promote AlCl3 catalytic activity in the carboxyla-
tion of toluene.[120] In 2016, Ma and co-workers performed a
theoretical investigation into boron-doped lithium clusters,
BLin (n=3–6), for the carboxylation of simple aromatic com-
pounds with CO2.[121]
In 2009, Hattori and co-workers reported the carboxylation
of 1-substituted indoles and pyrrole promoted by equimolar
amounts of dimethylaluminum chloride.[122] In 2016, they fur-
ther
extended
the
substrate
scope
for
this
reaction
(Scheme 43), and proposed a possible reaction mechanism.[123]
For 1-unsubstituted indole, the yield was poor. In 2012, they
reported similar carboxylation of thiophene and benzothio-
phene assisted by equimolar amounts of ethylaluminum di-
chloride.[124] In 2012, Kobayashi and co-workers reported the
carboxylation of unprotected indole derivatives with CO2 medi-
ated by lithium tert-butoxide (Scheme 44).[125] The key to this
reaction is the use of a large excess of lithium tert-butoxide as
a base to inhibit decarboxylative side reactions. The reaction

proton from N@H, and the resulting anion reacts with CO2 to
form N-centered or C-3 carboxylates. Because the carboxyla-
tion reaction is reversible, C-3 carboxylates are generated at
high temperatures. Notably, the free NH of unprotected indole
derivatives plays an important role in the reaction. 1-Methylin-
dole cannot undergo this carboxylation under the same condi-
tions, which demonstrates that deprotonation by lithium tert-
butoxide is a key step in this reaction. In 2015, they extended
the reaction to the carboxylation of pyrrole derivatives with
CO2.[126] In the same year, Skrydstrup and co-workers
reported the cyclization of 2-alkynylindole by using
a catalytic amount of organic base TBD and five
equivalents of CO2 (Scheme 45).[127] Cyclization of
aryl-, heteroaryl-, aliphatic-, and alkenyl-substituted
2-alkynylindole, and 2-terminal 2-alkynylindole are
all viable. They believed that the reaction proceeded
through the following steps. First, TBD reacts with
CO2 to generate an addition product. Then the C-3
position of the indole attacks the addition product
or directly attacks CO2 to generate a new C@C bond.
Next, a rearomatized intermediate is obtained after
deprotonation. This intermediate undergoes C@O
bond formation to give the final product, while re-
generating the TBD catalyst (Scheme 46). In 2017,
Wong and co-workers performed DFT calculations
for this reaction.[128] They proposed a bifunctional ac-
tivation of indole and CO2 simultaneously by the bi-
cyclic guanidine catalyst. In 2016, Ma and co-workers
conducted a theoretical study of the C@H bond in-
sertion reaction of pyrrole or N-methylpyrrole with
short-lived CO2.[129]
In 2016, Xi and co-workers reported the lactamiza-
tion reaction of o-arylaniline with CO2 mediated by
methyl trifluoromethanesulfonate (MeOTf) and TBD
(Scheme 47).[130]
They
proposed
that
isocyanate
might be the active intermediate in this metal-free
reaction.
In 2017, Zhi and co-workers developed a novel lactonization
of heteroaryl and alkenyl C@H bonds with CO2 to synthesize
important coumarin derivatives under transition-metal-free
conditions (Scheme 48).[131]

CO2 (Scheme 49).[83] They found that 2-arylpyridines and 1-aryl-
pyrazoles could undergo C@H bond activation to produce the
corresponding carboxylated products in the presence of RhI
catalyst and AlMe2(OMe) (2 equiv). The choice of phosphine
ligand is critical for the reaction: more sterically hindered mon-
odentate phosphine ligands, such as P(Mes)3 (Mes=mesityl)
and PCy3, perform better, and bidentate phosphine ligands are
detrimental to the reaction. The reaction mechanism is pro-
posed to be as follows: first, RhICl reacts with methylaluminum
reagent to generate methylrhodium(I); then, chelation-assisted
aryl C@H bond activation (oxidative addition) generates aryl tri-
valent rhodium, and reductive elimination of methane produ-
ces the key monovalent aryl rhodium species; this species un-
dergoes nucleophilic addition to CO2 and then transmetalation
with the methylaluminum reagent to obtain aluminum carbox-
ylate, while methylrhodium(I) is regenerated (Scheme 49). In

fects of ligands and reagents in Rh-catalyzed C(sp2)@H bond
carboxylation with CO2 through DFT calculations.[132] Based on
DFT
calculations,
a
similar
mechanism
was
proposed
(Scheme 50). In the catalytic cycle, CO2 insertion is the rate-de-
termining step. In addition to its role as a methylation reagent,
AlMe2(OMe) can also serve as a Lewis acid to promote CO2 in-
sertion. The origin of the promoting effect of P(Mes)3 on the
reactivity is derived from the stabilizing effect due to the favor-
able agostic interaction of Rh with the ortho-methyl group of
P(Mes)3. In 2016, Ma and co-workers successfully inserted CO2
into aryl C@H bonds on the backbone of the MOF UiO-
67(dcppy) to generate free carboxylate groups (Scheme 51).[133]
Their catalytic system and the proposed reaction mechanism
are similar to those of Iwasawa and co-workers.[83] UiO-
67(dcppy)-COOH obtained in this reaction can be
used as a heterogeneous Brønsted acid catalyst to
catalyze the methanolysis of epoxides.
In 2014, Sato and co-workers found that 1-arylpyr-
azole derivatives could sequentially undergo rutheni-
um-catalyzed C(sp2)@H silylation and fluoride-medi-
ated carboxylation (Scheme 52).[134] They believed
that the pyrazole group could play two roles: pro-
moting ortho-silylation through the formation of a
five-membered ruthenacycle intermediate and pro-
moting carboxylation by an electron-withdrawing
pyrazole nitrogen atom.
In 2015, Hou and co-workers reported the formal
C@H bond carboxylation of aromatic rings contain-
ing directing groups or heterocycles catalyzed by a
CuI–NHC complex (Scheme 53).[135] The reaction is
carried out in two steps: first, the aromatic ring is
deprotonated with iBu3Al(TMP)Li to form the corre-
sponding arylaluminum intermediate, which is then
catalyzed by CuI–NHC complex to give the corre-
sponding carboxylated products. This reaction has
high regioselectivity, broad substrate scope, and
good tolerance of functional groups. For heterocy-
cles such as benzofuran, benzothiophene, and tert-
butyl 1H-indole-1-carboxylate (N-Boc-indole), the re-
action occurs selectively at the C-2 position.

ligand, which overrides the site selectivity dictated by the well-
known Kolbe–Schmitt-type reaction. Later, they successfully
applied this RhII catalysis approach to similar types of sub-
strate.[137,138]
In 2018, Yu and co-workers reported the first [Pd(tfa)2]-cata-
lyzed (TFA=trifluoroacetate) benzamide-directed carbonylation
of unactivated aryl C@H bonds with atmospheric CO2 to afford
a series of phthalimides (Scheme 55a).[139] Mechanistic investi-
gations suggested that the palladacycle might be an active in-
termediate, which further reacted with CO2 to generate the de-
sired product. In another work,[140] with benzylic alcohol as a
directing group, the authors achieved [Pd(tfa)2]-catalyzed lacto-
nization of unactivated aryl C@H bonds with CO2 to afford
phthalides (Scheme 55b). Remarkably, DFT calculations indicat-
ed that lactonization might involve insertion of two CO2 into
the O@Pd bond of the palladacycle, which is interesting and
novel compared with previous reports.

bond, and then reacts with the cesium salt of a second mole-
cule of 2-hydroxystyrene to produce a hexacyclic alkenyl–palla-
dium intermediate. The next step is a reversible nucleophilic
carboxylation of this intermediate with CO2 to give a palladium
carboxylate intermediate. The palladium carboxylate intermedi-
ate reacts with another molecule of 2-hydroxystyrene and
Cs2CO3 to give the coumarin product, while the cyclometalated
intermediate is regenerated (Scheme 57). Through stoichiomet-
ric experiments, they isolated the cyclometalated intermedi-
ates, the structures of which were confirmed by means of
single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Interestingly, a transition-metal-
free version of this reaction was reported by Zhi and co-work-
ers in 2017 (Scheme 56b).[131] The reaction conditions are much
harsher for the transition-metal-free version compared with
that of the Pd-catalyzed version.
In 2016, Yu and co-workers developed a transition-metal-
free lactamization of alkenyl and heteroaryl C@H bonds with
CO2 (Scheme 58).[142] A series of 2-quinolinone and polyhetero-
cycles were synthesized. The use of excess amounts of sodium
tert-butoxide as a base and high temperature are key to an ef-
ficient transformation. Isocyanate is proposed as the active in-
termediate in this reaction.
In 2016, based on previous work,[113,114,123,124] Hattori and co-
workers reported a EtAlCl2/2,6-disubstituted pyridine mediated
carboxylation of a-aryl alkenes and trisubstituted alkenes with
CO2 (Scheme 59).[143] In terms of practical yield, this is the first
reaction in which a vinyl hydrogen atom is replaced by a car-
boxyl group. The choice of a base with suitable steric hin-
drance and basicity is crucial to this reaction. Notably, the base
can be used as a catalyst in this reaction, but the amount of
EtAlCl2 must be stoichiometric.
In 2018, Yu and co-workers reported a novel synthesis of
1,3-oxazin-6-ones from enamides and CO2 through C@H car-
boxylation and one-pot cyclization (Scheme 60).[144] Nucleophil-
ic attack on CO2 by the electron-rich alkene is demonstrated
for this reaction.
The direct synthesis of acrylates from CO2 and ethylene is an
ideal and economical method, but this reaction is incredibly
challenging. In industry, sodium acrylate is a monomer used
for the synthesis of sodium polyacrylate; a versatile polymeric

material. In 2012, Limbach and co-workers first realized a
nickel-catalyzed synthesis of sodium acrylate from CO2 and
ethylene (Scheme 61).[145] The TON of the catalyst can exceed
10. Critical to success was the separation and characterization
of several key organonickel intermediates of elementary reac-
tions in the catalytic cycle, as well as a combination of experi-
mental data and theoretical calculations. Because the base
sodium tert-butoxide can react with CO2 to produce relatively
stable carbonic acid half-esters, the catalytic cycle must be di-
vided into two parts: a CO2-rich -poor regimes. This shortcom-
ing has greatly limited the practicality of this method. In 2014,
Vogt and co-workers used a nickel catalyst system to further
increase the catalytic TON to 21 (Scheme 62).[146] Compared
with the work of Limbach and co-workers, the method report-
ed by Vogt and co-workers is easier to operate and avoids re-
peated replacement of reactant gases. Vogt and co-workers
noted that the challenge of this reaction was that the nickela-
lactone intermediate did not readily undergo b-hydride elimi-
nation due to the conformation of the five-membered ring.
They found that adding the “hard cation soft anion” salt LiI to
the reaction system can effectively promote decomposition of
the nickelalactone intermediate to produce lithium acrylate
(Scheme 62). The role of LiI in the reaction has also been sup-
ported by DFT calculations. In 2014, Limbach and co-work-
ers[147] made further improvements to their previously reported
system.[145] Through screening of ligands, solvents, bases, and
so forth, they succeeded in realizing nickel-catalyzed carboxyla-
tion of a series of alkenes (including ethylene, styrene, and 1,3-
butadiene; Scheme 63).[147] The choice of base is crucial for the
reaction: a suitable base not only has strong basicity, so that
the nickelalactone intermediate can be deprotonated to re-
lease the product, but also has weaker nucleophilicity to avoid
reacting directly with CO2. Sodium 2-fluorophenoxide
is the most suitable base in their selection. For ethyl-
ene, the catalyst TON can reach 107. Except for 2-vi-
nylpyridine, which gives a branched a,b-unsaturated
carboxylic acid salt, other alkenes are capable of se-
lectively producing linear products. In terms of ste-
reoselectivity, this reaction has high E selectivity. Ter-
minal, unactivated alkenes or internal ones cannot
participate in this reaction. In 2015, Limbach and co-
workers reported the first palladium-catalyzed car-
boxylation
of
ethylene
and
conjugated
dienes
(Scheme 64a).[148] The proposed reaction mechanism
is similar to that of the nickel-catalyzed reaction
mechanism.[147] In 2015, Schaub and co-workers[149]

the catalyst TON can reach a level comparable to that of the
nickel catalyst system (TON=106) reported by Limbach and
co-workers, while avoiding use of zinc; in addition, less toxic
anisole is used as a solvent (Scheme 64b). They also proposed
a new concept that combined product separation, catalyst re-
covery, and base regeneration. Schaub and co-workers also
studied the elementary reactions involved in nickel-catalyzed
carboxylation of some simple alkenes.[150] Recently, Schaub and
co-workers found that, by using the [Pd(PPh3)4]/dcpe system
and sodium tert-butoxide as a base, ethylene, 1,3-butadiene,
and unactivated terminal alkenes or internal alkenes can un-
dergo carboxylation at 1458C (Scheme 64c).[151] Sodium tert-
butoxide is more basic than sodium 2-fluorophenoxide and ap-
plicable to a broader range of substrates for this system. Nota-
bly, the decomposition temperature of carbonate esters given
by the reaction of sodium tert-butoxide and CO2 is 608C. Later,
by using amide solvents, they further improved their palladium
catalysis system to achieve TONs greater than 500.[152] In 2017,
Cummins and co-workers developed a series of novel cis-mac-
rocyclic diphosphines ligands, and found that these ligands
showed promising catalytic activity in Ni-[153] and Co-cata-
lyzed[154] CO2/ethylene coupling reactions.

3.3. Carboxylation of other types of C(sp2)@H bonds with
CO2
In 2017, Mo and co-workers reported Cs2CO3-promoted carbox-
ylation of the ipso-C@H bond in the diazo group with CO2
under very mild reaction conditions (Scheme 65).[155] With in-
trinsic nucleophilicity, the diazo group has been found to react
with various electrophiles, such as acyl chloride, aldehyde,
ketone, imine, and boron compounds. This is the first report of
utilizing CO2 in a diazo addition reaction. The carboxylation re-
action exhibits high reactivity and is amenable to subsequent
diversification. The resulting a-diazo carboxylate can be readily
converted into esters and amides in a one-pot fashion. In addi-
tion to stable a-diazo carbonyl compounds, labile TMSCHN2 is
also a competent substrate for the desired transformation. This
method provides a modular synthesis of a series of unsymmet-
rical 1,3-diester/keto/amide diazo compounds in moderate to
excellent yields (up to 99%) with good functional group com-
patibility.
In 2018, Lee and Juhl reported an interesting umpolung re-
activity of aromatic aldehydes with CO2 (Scheme 66).[156] By
using KCN and Ti(OiPr)4, they achieved direct carboxylation of
aromatic aldehydes with CO2 (1 atm) to afford a-keto acid
products under mild reaction conditions. This method has
been expanded to the synthesis of a-amino acids derivatives;
thus illustrating the chemical synthesis of essential bioactive
molecules from CO2.

2006, Hara and co-workers reported an electrochemical carbox-
ylation of aliphatic ketones with CO2 to yield b-ketocarboxylic
acids in moderate to good yields (Scheme 67).[175] It is believed
that CO2 is reduced to the corresponding radical anion under
the reaction conditions; this radical anion species can facilitate
enolate formation. In 2008, Jessop and co-workers combined
the carboxylation of ketones promoted by DBU with asymmet-
ric
hydrogenation
of
b-ketocarboxylic
acids
catalyzed
by
[RuCl2{(S)-BINAP}]
((S)-BINAP=(S)-(@)-(1,1’-binaphthalene-2,2’-
diyl)bis(diphenylphosphine)) for the asymmetric synthesis of b-
hydroxycarboxylic acids (Scheme 68).[172] In 2011, Beckman and
Munshi reported the carboxylation of ketones catalyzed by a
reversible CO2 carrier (RCC; Scheme 69).[173] RCC is obtained by
reacting CO2 with DBU, which is supported on methylhydrosi-
loxane dimethyl siloxane copolymer. The extent of the carbox-
ylation reaction might be related to the percentage of enol
tautomer of the substrate. The catalyst can be conveniently re-
cycled by filtration. This RCC strategy holds potential for low-
pressure CO2 utilization in chemical transformations.
Normally, b-ketocarboxylic acids are thermodynamically un-
stable due to a high tendency towards decarboxylation. Thus,
the in situ conversion of b-ketocarboxylic acids into stable
compounds by tandem reactions becomes a very viable strat-
egy.[176–181] In 2012, Yamada and co-workers reported a silver-
catalyzed carboxylative cyclization of alkynyl-substituted ke-
tones (Scheme 70a).[177] The reaction mechanism is proposed
to be as follows: in the presence of base, the substrate gener-
ates an enolate that reacts with CO2 to form a b-ketocarboxy-
late, and the silver catalyst activates the C/C bond to capture
the b-ketocarboxylate, followed by formation of the lactone
product. For ketones with two different protons a and a’ to
the carbonyl group, the reaction can selectively generate g-lac-
tones. The geometry of the C=C bond in the product was con-
firmed to be of Z geometry by means of single-crystal X-ray
diffraction and NOE experiments. Based on the above work, in
2013, Yamada and co-workers reported a silver-catalyzed
carboxylative
cyclization
of
o-alkynyl
acetophenone
(Scheme 70b).[178] In this reaction, the silver catalyst activates
the C/C bond, which captures the carbonyl group of the b-ke-
tocarboxylic acid intermediate to yield the dihydroisobenzofur-
an framework. In 2014, Zhang and co-workers[179] reported a re-
action (Scheme 70c) similar to that reported by Yamada and
co-workers. In 2017, Yamada and co-workers reported the
silver-catalyzed carboxylation of conjugated ynones with CO2
to yield highly functionalized tetronic acids (Scheme 70d).[182]
Notably, in 2016, Zhang and co-workers reported a copper-cat-
alyzed
double
carboxylation
of
o-alkynyl
acetophenone
(Scheme 71).[181] This reaction undergoes carboxylation, intra-
molecular
cyclization,
and
a

Substrates with alkyl-substituted alkynyl groups have higher
selectivity for double carboxylation than that of substrates
with aryl-substituted alkynyl groups. In 2015, Zhang and co-
workers reported the carboxylative cyclization of o-hydroxy-
and
o-acetamidoacetophenone
promoted
by
DBU
(Scheme 72).[180] In the reaction of o-acetamidoacetophenone,
the acyl group migrated from the nitrogen atom to the carbon
atom.
Reports on the carboxylation of the carbonyl g-C(sp3)@H
bond with CO2 are relatively rare. In 1999, Yoshida and co-
workers reported the carboxylative cyclization of 4-methyl-3-

In 2016, Zhang and co-workers reported the carboxylative cyc-
lization of various substituted 1-propenones with CO2 promot-
ed by CsF or Cs2CO3 (Scheme 73).[184] This reaction may have
undergone a tandem carbonyl g-C(sp3)@H bond carboxylation
and base-promoted cyclization. This transition-metal-free reac-
tion was carried out in dilute DMSO to inhibit substrate dimeri-
zation. Using
18O-labeled CO2, they found that only one
oxygen atom in the a-pyrone product
came from CO2
(Scheme 74). This proves that the cyclization reaction may
have experienced an intramolecular attack of the enolate
oxygen on the carbonyl moiety in the resulting carboxylate
group.
In 2012, Sato and co-workers reported a formal carboxyla-
tion of C(sp3)@H bonds with CO2.[185] The sequential protocol

lyzed silylation of benzylic C(sp3)@H bonds, which is directed
by a nitrogen-atom-containing directing group (quinoline, qui-
noxaline, pyridine, etc.), and a fluoride-mediated carboxylation
(Scheme 75). The C(sp3)@Si bond can undergo fluoride-promot-
ed carboxylation, whereas the C(sp2)@Si bond does not. This
advantage provides convenience for further manipulation of
the carboxylated products. In 2013, Sato and co-workers ex-
panded the substrate scope of this reaction.[186] They found
that [Ir(cod)OMe]2 or [{Rh(cod)Cl}2] could catalyze the silylation
of C(sp3)@H bonds adjacent to nitrogen atoms ; the reaction
was controlled by a nitrogen-containing directing group (pyri-
dine, isoquinoline, quinoline, etc.). With the participation of
fluoride ions, the resulting silylated product could be convert-
ed into an a-amino acid derivative. In 2017, Jamison and co-
workers reported the photoredox a-carboxylation of amines
with CO2 for the continuous-flow synthesis of a-amino acids
(Scheme 76).[187] The single-electron reduction of CO2 is the key
to this reaction.
In 2015, Murakami and co-workers reported a light-driven
carboxylation
of
o-alkylphenyl
ketones
with
CO2
(Scheme 77).[188] The reaction mechanism is proposed to be as
follows: the substrate absorbs a photon to produce the excited
state; the oxygen atom of the excited carbonyl group abstracts
a hydrogen from the ortho-methyl group to form a 1,4-biradi-
cal species, which is then converted into o-quinodimethane.
The E isomer can undergo a [4+2] cycloaddition with CO2, and
finally ring opening occurs to form a carboxylic acid product,
whereas the Z isomer will undergo a 1,5-hydrogen shift to re-
generate the starting material. The reaction can be promoted
by UV irradiation or sunlight. Recently, Su and Su studied the
mechanism of this reaction through theoretical calculations.[189]
In 1995, Kudo and co-workers reported the Cs2CO3-promot-
ed carboxylation of allylic C@H bonds of cesium 3-crotonate
with CO2.[190] In 2016, Murakami and co-workers reported the
carboxylation of allylic C@H bonds of a simple alkene with CO2
promoted by light, ketone, and copper complex systems
(Scheme 78).[191] The mechanism was proposed to be as fol-
lows: the ketone and alkene react under light excitation to
form tertiary homoallyl alcohol intermediates; the tertiary ho-
moallyl alcohol reacts with copper tert-butoxide generated in
situ by copper complexes and potassium tert-butoxide. The re-
sulting
copper
alkoxide
undergoes
C@C
bond
cleavage
through b-carbon elimination to yield the ketone and allylcop-
per intermediate; nucleophilic addition of the allylcopper inter-
mediate to CO2 forms the copper carboxylate, which under-
goes ligand exchange with potassium tert-butoxide to produce
the carboxylate product and regenerate copper tert-butoxide.
The above mechanism was supported by several control ex-
periments. Sato and co-workers reported a cobalt-catalyzed al-
lylic C(sp3)@H carboxylation with CO2 to regioselectively afford
linear 3-butenoic acid motifs with good functional group toler-
ance (Scheme 79).[192] The formation of a low-valent allyl–Co
species is key to this reaction. Hou and co-workers reported

the copper-catalyzed allylic C@H carboxylation of allyl aryl
ethers with CO2 to afford 2-aryloxy butenoates (Scheme 80).[193]
The reaction consists of deprotonative allylic C@H bond alumi-
nation of allyl aryl ethers, with an aluminum ate base
(iBu3Al(TMP)Li), and subsequent carboxylation of the resulting
allylaluminum species with CO2 catalyzed by an NHC–copper
complex. Notably, they also found that DBU could catalyze the
isomerization of 2-aryloxy-3-butenoate products to (Z)-2-ary-
loxy-2-butenoate isomers.
C(sp3)@H bond activation and CO2 carboxylation promoted
by transition-metal complexes have received growing attention
in recent years.[194–203] In 2008, Oro and co-workers reported a
reaction in which CO2 was formally inserted into the ligand
C@H bond of an iridium complex (Scheme 81).[199] In 2010, they
published further research on this reaction.[200] In 2012, Anni-
bale and Song also reported similar reactions (Scheme 82).[201]
They proposed the following mechanism: a backbone carbon
of diazafluorenide undergoes nucleophilic attack on CO2, and
then proton migration occurs. Different from the work of Oro
and co-workers, the reaction reported by Annibale and Song is
reversible. Braunstein and co-workers reported similar reversi-
ble carboxylation reactions.[195,198] In 2013, on the basis of com-
plexes of the 4,5-diazafluorenide ligand and divalent rutheni-
um used in previous work, Song and co-workers investigated
the reactivity of this ligand toward CO2 with trivalent rhodium,
monovalent rhodium, and monovalent copper as spectator
metal centers.[202] They proposed the role of the spectator
metal center was probably to modulate strength of the result-
ing C@C bond and adjust the acidity of the C@H bond. Interest-
ingly, they also first found that metal-free compounds were

Similar to CO2, methane is also a cheap, abundant, and quite
inert C1 source. C(sp3)@H carboxylation of methane can be
used to synthesize acetic acid, which is widely used in indus-
try.[204–225] In 2013, Wang and co-workers investigated the reac-
tion mechanism of the conversion of methane and CO2 into
acetic acid catalyzed by zinc-modified H-ZSM-5 zeolite (Zn/H-
ZSM-5).[223] They first demonstrated, through solid-state NMR
spectroscopy experiments, that Zn/H-ZSM-5 could catalyze the
conversion of methane and CO2 into acetic acid over a temper-
ature range of 523–773 K. The possible catalytic mechanism of
the bifunctional catalyst was revealed by means of solid-state
13C and 1H MAS NMR spectroscopy: methane is activated as
methylzinc species and Brønsted protons, whereas CO2 is acti-
vated as surface carbonate ion species; CO2 is inserted into the
Zn@C bond of methylzinc species to generate a key surface
zinc acetate species, which then abstracts a proton from
Brønsted acid sites to release the acetic acid product. In 2014,
Basset and co-workers reported the low-temperature activation
of methane over silica-supported zinc-exchanged phospho-
tungstic acid (Zn-HPW/SiO2; Scheme 84).[224] Zn-HPW/SiO2 can

ture, whereas, at higher temperature, methane reacts with O2
to give methanol, or reacts with CO2 to give acetic acid. Re-
cently, Ge and co-workers reported a theoretical study of Zn-
doped ceria-catalyzed C@C coupling reaction of CO2 and meth-
ane.[225] The results show that the Zn dopant stabilizes the
methyl group through the formation of a Zn@C bond, thereby
inhibiting subsequent dehydrogenation of methane. CO2 can
be inserted into the Zn@C bond in an activated bent configura-
tion. The transition state of this insertion reaction is in the
form of a three-centered Zn@C@C arrangement, with an activa-
tion energy barrier of 0.51 eV. The acetate ion generated by
C@C coupling can bind to the surface proton generated by dis-
sociation of methane, and then desorbs in the form of free
acetic acid. They also examined other possible dopants, such
as Al, Ga, Cd, In, and Ni, and found a positive correlation be-
tween the activation barrier of C@C coupling and the electro-
negativity of the dopant. In addition, carboxylation reactions
of methane and other simple alkanes with CO2 have also been
reported.[226–232]
In 2017, Martin and co-workers reported a remote carboxyla-
tion
of
halogenated
aliphatic
hydrocarbons
with
CO2
(Scheme 85).[233] Neither purification nor isolation of the inter-
mediate halogenated compounds was necessary for this regio-
convergent carboxylation of alkanes with CO2 to obtain single-
regioisomer carboxylic acids. Tunable and controllable dis-
placement of the Ni catalyst through a saturated hydrocarbon
side chain enables switchable site-selective carboxylation at
remote C(sp3)@H sites.
5. Summary and Outlook
The carboxylation of C@H bonds with CO2 combines the activa-
tion of chemically inert C@H bonds with thermodynamically
stable CO2 and thus has great research value. This type of reac-
tion has developed rapidly in recent years and many important
advances have been made. The advantages are as follows:
1) the use of CO2 as a C1 source avoids the use of toxic CO or
phosgene; 2) C@H bonds are ubiquitous in organic molecules;
3) it conforms with the requirements of green chemistry, in
terms of atom economy and step economy; 4) it is easy to in-
corporate into tandem or multicomponent reactions; and
5) many reactions have good industrial application prospects,
such as the syntheses of FDCA and sodium acrylate.
The Kolbe–Schmitt reaction, a classical C@H bond carboxyla-
tion with CO2, has been an industrial method for producing
salicylic acid. At present, there are several problems in this
field: the reaction conditions are relatively harsh in many
cases, for example, requiring high temperature or high-pres-
sure CO2; there is still much room for expansion in the scope
of the substrates, especially the carboxylation of C(sp3)@H
bonds; many reactions still require stoichiometric additives or

metal-exchange reagents; some carboxylation catalysts are not
sufficiently efficient; some reactions are unsatisfactory in terms
of chemo-, regio-, and stereoselectivity; the mechanism of
some reactions is not clear; green reaction media are still
rarely used; and the cost and recovery of catalysts remains a
problem. In terms of the reaction mechanism, a dual activation
strategy is more promising than the single activation of C@H
bonds or CO2. Inexpensive metal catalysis, transition-metal-
free, electrochemical, and light-driven methods deserve more
attention. Combining theoretical calculations with experimen-
tal research will certainly promote the growth of this field.
More effective integration of CO2 capture and chemical trans-
formation is still a major challenge in this field.
