Preface to the Second Edition
In the revised and enlarged edition I corrected numerous errors and typos found in
the ﬁrst edition. In the Chaps. 1, 2, 7 and 8 I have made, in the interests of clarity,
a large number of small changes. Some sections, which even I myself was not able
to understand 5 years after they were written, were rewritten again Several new
sections with applications of formalism were added: 1.7.7, 6.9, 8.7.1 and 8.7.2.
The main alteration in this edition consists of the incorporation of a new chapter
devoted to the description of a relativistic spinning particle in external ﬁelds. It can
be considered as a non-trivial application of the formalism of constrained systems
described in Chap. 8. A review of the achievements in this fascinating area before
1968 can be found in the book of Corben [58]. Contrary to Corben, who discussed
the problem on the level of equations of motion, my emphasis has been placed
on the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian variational formulations for the description of
rotational degrees of freedom and their inﬂuence on the trajectory of a spinning
body. I present the so-called vector model of spin and show that it provides a
uniﬁed conceptual framework, allowing to collect and tie together a lot of ideas and
achievements accumulated on the subject after publication of the Corben’s book.

Preface to the First Edition
Formalism of classical mechanics underlies a number of powerful mathematical
methods, widely used in theoretical and mathematical physics [1–11]. In these
lectures we present some selected topics of classical mechanics, which may be
useful for graduate-level students intending to work in one of the branches of a
vast ﬁeld of theoretical physics. Except for the last chapter, which is devoted to
the discussion of singular theories and their local symmetries, the topics selected
correspond to the standard course of classical mechanics.
For the convenience of the reader, we have tried to make the material of different
chapters as independent as possible. So, the reader who is familiar with Lagrangian
mechanics can proceed to any one of Chaps. 3–8 after reading the second chapter.
In our presentation of the material we have tried, where possible, to replace
intuitive motivations and “scientiﬁc folklore” by exact proofs or direct compu-
tations. To illustrate how classical-mechanics formalism works in other branches
of theoretical physics, we have presented examples related to electrodynamics as
well as to relativistic and quantum mechanics. Most of the suggested exercises are
directly related to the main body of the text.
While in some cases the formalism is developed beyond the traditional level
adopted in the standard textbooks on classical mechanics [12–14], the only mathe-
matical prerequisites are some knowledge of calculus and linear algebra.
In the frameworks of classical and quantum theories, the Hamiltonian and
Lagrangian formulations each have advantages and disadvantages. Since our focus
here is Hamiltonian mechanics, let us mention some of the arguments for using this
type of formalism.
•
There is a remarkable democracy between variables of position and velocity in
Nature: being independent one from another, they contain complete information
on the properties of a classical system at a given instance. Besides, just the
positions and velocities at the initial instant of time are necessary and sufﬁcient
to predict an evolution of the system. In Lagrangian formalism this democracy,
while reﬂected in the initial conditions, is not manifest in the course of evolution,
since only variables of position are treated as independent in Lagrangian
vii

Preface to the First Edition
equations. Hamiltonian formalism restores this democracy, treating positions and
velocities on equal footing, as independent coordinates that parameterize a phase
space.
•
According to the canonical quantization paradigm, the construction of the
Hamiltonian formulation for a given classical system is the ﬁrst necessary step
in the passage from classical to quantum theory. It is sufﬁcient to point out that
quantum evolution in the Heisenberg picture is obtained from the Hamiltonian
equations through replacement of the phase-space variables by corresponding
operators. As to the operators, their commutators are required to resemble the
Poisson brackets of the phase-space variables.
•
The conventional way to describe a relativistic theory is to formulate it in terms
of a singular Lagrangian (the singularity is the price we pay for the manifest rela-
tivistic invariance of the formulation). It implies a rather complicated structure of
Lagrangian equations, which may consist of both second- and ﬁrst-order differ-
ential equations as well as algebraic ones. Besides, there may be identities present
among the equations, which implies functional arbitrariness in the corresponding
solutions. It should be mentioned that, in the modern formulation, physically
interesting theories (electrodynamics, gauge ﬁeld theories, the standard model,
string theory, etc.) are of this type. In this case, Hamiltonian formulation
gives a somewhat clearer geometric picture of classical dynamics [8]: all the
solutions are restricted to lying on some surface in the phase space, while the
abovementioned arbitrariness is avoided by postulating classes of equivalent
trajectories. Physical quantities are then represented by functions deﬁned in these
classes. The procedure for investigation of this picture is based entirely on the
use of special coordinates adopted to the surface, which in turn require a rather
detailed development of the theory of canonical transformations. Altogether
Hamiltonian formulation leads to a self-consistent physical interpretation of a
general singular theory, forming the basis for numerous particular prescriptions
and approaches to quantization of concrete theories [10].

Notation and Conventions
The terminology of classical mechanics is not universal. To avoid any confusion, the
quantities of the conﬁguration (phase) space are conventionally called Lagrangian
(Hamiltonian) quantities.
Generalized coordinates of the conﬁguration space are denoted by qa. Latin
indices from the beginning of the alphabet a, b, c, and so on generally range from 1
to n, a D 1; 2; : : : ; n.
Phase-space coordinates are often denoted by one letter Zi D .qa; pb/. Latin
indices from the middle of the alphabet i, j, k, and so on generally range from 1 to
2n, i D 1; 2; : : : ; 2n.
Greek indices from the beginning of the alphabet ˛, ˇ,  are used to denote some
subgroup of the group of variables, for example qa D .q1; q˛/, ˛ D 2; 3; : : : ; n.
Repeated indices are generally summed, unless otherwise indicated. The “up”
and “down” position of the index of any quantity is ﬁxed. For example, we write qa,
pb and never any other way.
Time variable is denoted either by  or by t. A dot over any quantity denotes the
time derivative of that quantity
Pqa D dqa
d ;
while partial derivatives are denoted by
@L.q/
@qa
D @aL;
@H.Z/
@Zi
D @iH:
The same symbol is generally used to denote a variable and a function. For example,
we write Z0i D Z0i.Zj/, instead of the expression Z0i D f i.Zj/ for the change of
coordinates.

Sketch of Lagrangian Formalism
Abstract
System of Particles To start with, we recall how a system of particles is described
in classical mechanics. Analytic description is achieved by introducing three-
dimensional Euclidean space equipped with a Cartesian coordinate system. When
equations can be supplemented by initial conditions that guarantee a unique
solution, we say that the equations admit formulation of the Cauchy problem. Using
this terminology, a normal system admits formulation of the Cauchy problem.

System of Particles To start with, we recall how a system of particles is described
in classical mechanics. Analytic description is achieved by introducing three-
dimensional Euclidean space equipped with a Cartesian coordinate system. Then
its points are labeled by position vectors M $ Er D .x1; x2; x3/  .x; y; z/. The time
evolution of a particle is presented by a curve Er D Er.t/. The evolution is governed
by Newton’s equation

In classical mechanics the force EF assumed to be a known function of indicated
arguments (or derivable from a potential). So Eq. (1.1) relates accelerations,
velocities and coordinates, that is, it represents a system of three ordinary differential
equations of second order for determining three functions xa.t/.

Sketch of Lagrangian Formalism
Example Electric charges in movement produce electromagnetic force in the
space around them. This can be described by vectors of electric EE.t; xa/
and magnetic EB.t; xa/ ﬁelds given at each space-time point. Then Newton’s
equation of a particle with electric charge e in this external ﬁeld is
mREr D eEE.t;Er/ C e
cŒPEr; EB.t;Er/:
(1.3)
Here ŒPEr; EBa D abcPxbBc is a vector product, and c is a universal constant (see
Sect. 1.3). Electric ﬁeld EE is directed from positive charge (proton) to inﬁnity,
so the force eEE is opposite to EE for the negative charge (electron). Concerning
the agreements on magnetic ﬁeld, see Example 2 on page 67.
Particular and General Solutions Mathematically, Eq. (1.1) belong to the class
of normal systems, that is all higher derivatives Rxa are separated on the left-hand
side of the equations. According to the theory of differential equations, a normal
system has well-established properties. In particular, under known restrictions on
the right-hand side, the theorem of the existence and uniqueness of a solution holds:
given the numbers xa
0, va
0, there is (at least locally) a unique solution xa./ of the
system (1.1) that obeys the initial conditions xa.0/ D xa
0, Pxa.0/ D va
0.
When equations can be supplemented by initial conditions that guarantee a
unique solution, we say that the equations admit formulation of the Cauchy problem.
Using this terminology, a normal system admits formulation of the Cauchy problem.
This theorem implies that ordinary differential equation admits an inﬁnite
number of solutions. They can be described simultaneously using the notion of
a general solution. It is not difﬁcult to forecast that the family of solutions can
be parameterized by six parameters. Roughly speaking, to kill two derivatives
acting, for example, on x1, we need to carry out two integrations. This implies the
appearance of two integration constants, say c1, d1, in the resulting expression. In
this way we arrive at the notion of a general solution deﬁned as follows. A function
of (1 C 6) variables Er.t; ca; da/ is called a general solution to the system (1.1) if (a)
it satisﬁes the system for any values of ca, da; (b) given the initial conditions Er0, Ev0,
there are numbers Qca, Qda such that Er.0; Qca; Qda/ D Er0, PEr.0; Qca; Qda/ D Ev0.
Exercise Conﬁrm that any particular solution to the normal system is con-
tained in its general solution.
The physical content of these mathematical facts can be summarized as follows.
First, only positions and velocities at a given instance are necessary to predict the
future of a system (we need not know, for example, accelerations). It is said that Er0,
Ev0 unambiguously determine the instantaneous state of a system. Second, a system

evolves in time in a unique way. In contrast to quantum mechanics, evolution in
classical mechanics has a causal character. These properties of Newton’s universe
are known as Newton’s principle of determinism.
We recall some notions that will play a fundamental role in the discussion of
Lagrangian formalism.
Kinetic Energy Let Er.t/ be a solution to Eq. (1.1). The work done by the force EF
is equal to the value of the line integral along the curve Er.t/, and using Newton’s
equation can be computed as follows:

Potential Energy: Properties of Conservative Force To proceed further we
restrict ourselves to the case of a conservative system. A ﬁeld of force is conser-
vative (or potential), if it can be derived as the gradient of a function U.xa/
Fa D  @U
@xa :
(1.6)
This function is called the potential energy of a system. Note that U Cconst leads to
the same force as U. So, potential energy is deﬁned with only an additive constant.
It is often used to choose a zero value for the potential energy at a desired point. For
the work done by the potential force we write

Equation (1.8) states that a potential ﬁeld is curl-free. This follows from direct
computation: Œ Er; EFa D abc@b@cU D 0.

Equation (1.10) states that the work done by a potential ﬁeld does not depend on
a choice of line (either .1; 2/ or ˇ.1; 2// that connects points 1 and 2. To conﬁrm
this, apply (1.9) to the closed line .1; 2/ [ ˇ.2; 1/.
Finally, Eq. (1.11) states that the work done by a potential ﬁeld is equal to the
difference of potential energies at the initial and ﬁnal points. To see this, notice
that according to Eq. (1.10) we can compute the work (1.7) using any curve Er.t/

It is known that on a plane the conditions (1.6), (1.8), (1.9), (1.10), and (1.11)
are mutually equivalent; any one of them can be taken as a deﬁnition of a (two-

(1.13)
Comparing (1.5) with (1.11) we conclude that in a movement from one point to
another, the change in kinetic energy is always balanced by a change in potential
energy. This can be written in the form of a law of conservation
ŒT C UjM1 D ŒT C UjM2 ;
(1.14)
The quantity E  T C U is called the (total) energy of the system. Eq. (1.14)
represents the law of conservation of total energy stating that E of a conservative
system takes the same value along a trajectory of motion.
Exercise Above we have considered the case of time-independent potential.
Total energy is not preserved when the potential depends explicitly on time,
U.x; t/. Explain why the reasoning presented above does not work for this
case.

Law of Conservation of Angular Momentum Consider a particle in a central
ﬁeld. The central ﬁeld is deﬁned by a potential depending only on a distance to a
given point. Choosing a coordinate system with its origin at that point, the potential
reads U D U.r/, where r D jErj D

This implies the law of conservation of angular momentum
EL  ŒEr; mEv D const:
(1.18)
One remarkable consequence of Eq. (1.18) is that the particle orbit in the central
ﬁeld is a planar one, see Fig. 1.1 on page 6. To see this, take a solution Er.t/ of
Newton’s equation (1.16). Note that its scalar product with EL vanishes, .Er.t/; EL/ D
.Er; ŒEr; mEv/ D 0. That is, the position vector is orthogonal to the ﬁxed vector EL at
any instant of motion. So, Er.t/ at any t lies on a plane containing the center of force
and perpendicular to EL. The vector EL can be determined from the initial conditions:
EL D ŒEr0; mEv0. So the plane of motion is the one that contains the vectors of the
initial position Er0 and the initial velocity Ev0.

A law of conservation, being in fact a ﬁrst-order differential equation, can be
used for simpliﬁcation of equations of motion. Below we present examples of how
this works.

(1.30)
As we have seen above, the particle trajectory lies on a plane that passes
through the center of the ﬁeld and is perpendicular to the constant vector
EL. Runge-Lenz and Hamiltonian vectors are mutually perpendicular and
lie on this plane. So we can introduce the coordinate system .x; y; z/ with
its axis along the vectors .EA; EU; EL/; see Fig. 1.1 on page 6.
Equations of motion for the new variables x; y and z have the same
form (1.30) (this will be discussed in some detail in the next section).
In this coordinate system we have Er.t/ D .x.t/; y.t/; 0/, that is, the z-
coordinate has trivial dynamics. The third equation of the system (1.30)
is satisﬁed and can be omitted. So, conservation of the angular momentum
allows us to simplify the problem: the three-dimensional problem reduces

This is an equation of a conic section with eccentricity e (the hyperbola for
e > 1, the parabola for e D 1 and the ellipse for 0 < e < 1), and with
focal parameter p (see Exercise 2 below). In what follows, we suppose that
the trajectory is an ellipse. According to (1.23), E < 0 for an ellipse. The
semi-major axis of the ellipse lies on the x -axis, and the right focus is in
the center of coordinate system, see Fig. 1.2 on page 10. Recalling that x-
axis has been chosen in the direction of EA, we conclude that Runge-Lenz
vector is directed towards the semi-major axis (perihelion) of the orbit. The
magnitude (1.23) of Runge-Lenz vector is equal to the orbit eccentricity e
times the coupling ˛, jEAj D ˛e. The Hamilton vector is directed towards
the semi-minor axis (aphelion).

Galilean Transformations: Principle of Galilean
Relativity
Cartesian coordinates and the evolution parameter which appear in Newton equa-
tions represent an idealization of the data of the measurement devices (rulers and
clocks) used by an observer in his laboratory. The laboratory is called an observer
or (reference) frame.2
The ﬁrst law of Newton states the existence of inertial frames with the following
property: motion of a free particle in any one of them looks as rectilinear motion
along a straight line, d2xa
dt2 D 0. The principle of Galilean relativity postulates the set
of transformations relating space-time coordinates of inertial frames. It also states
that equations of motion of any mechanical system, like the free one, retain their
form unchanged under the transformations, S0
a D DabSb (here Sa D 0 (S0
a D 0/
stands for equations of motion written by observer O (O0/, and D is an invertible
matrix). This property is called covariance of the equations. Below we present
the mathematical formulation of the principle of Galilean relativity and discuss its
physical content.

potential that depends on the relative distances between the particles. That is U.rjk/

The equations describe a rather general class of interacting systems, including
Newtonian gravity and Coulomb forces.
A remarkable algebraic property of the equations is that they take the same form
if we make the substitution (called below the Galilean transformation)
Eri.t/ D REri
0.t0/ C EVt0 C EC;
(1.45)

(1.46)
Here Rab is an orthogonal matrix, RRT D 1, and EV, EC, a are arbitrary constants.
Denoting the l.h.s. of Eq. (1.44) as ESi.Er.t//, one veriﬁes that the equality
ESi.Er.t// D R ESi.Er 0.t0//;
(1.47)
holds. This property is known as covariance of equations. Note that there are a
lot of transformations that do not leave the equations covariant (take, for example,
Eri.t/ D Eri0.t/C EVt3). The covariance (1.47) of basic equations of classical mechanics
under Galilean transformations is known as the principle of Galilean relativity. Its
more rigorous mathematical formulation is as follows.
Consider the space of functions Er
W R ! R3;Er
W t ! Er.t/. Galilean
transformation is the following map in this space:
G W Er.t/ ! Er 0.t/ D R1 h
Er.t C a/  EVt  EC
i
:
(1.48)
If Er.t/ represents a solution of equations of motion, then Er 0.t/ is a solution as well.
Physical Content of the Galilean Principle Its physical content is two-fold, due to
the possibility of two different geometric interpretations for the substitution (1.45).
In short, it can be treated either as the passage from one reference frame to another
(the so-called passive point of view), or as a displacement of the system under
investigation from one region of space-time to another (the active point of view).
Let us discuss these in further detail.
Passive Point of View In this case Er.t/ and Er 0.t0/ are regarded as radius-vectors of
the same point in two reference frames, O and O0. The point is observed by O at the
instant t and by O0 at the instant t0. Suppose the observers differ by displacement,
by orientation of axis and are in relative motion with constant velocity. In non-
relativistic mechanics it is postulated that formulas (1.45) and (1.46) represent the
law of transformation from one frame to the other. It consists of the following
transformations.
1. The transformation xa D x0a C Ca represents the space displacement: O sees the
origin of O0 in the point with the position vector EC.
2. The transformation xa D Rabx0b, where RRT D 1, represents rotation: O sees
the coordinate axis of O0 rotated through R. To justify this, note that O and O0,
related by this transformation, have the same origin. Besides, it does not change
the value of scalar product among two position vectors, .Er1;Er2/ D .Er 0
1;Er 0
2/. In
particular, it preserves distances between points, jEr 0j D jErj.

Any rotation can be parameterized by three numbers. For instance, they can
be components of the vector E˛ D .˛1; ˛2; ˛3/ directed along the rotation axis,
with a length equal to the rotation angle (see the end of this section for details).
3. The transformation xa D x0a C Vat is known as the Galilean boost. O sees O0
moving with velocity EV and passing through the origin of O at t D 0; see Fig. 1.4
on page 26. Then x0a are coordinates of the point Er measured by O0 at the instant t.
4. The transformation Er.t/ D Er 0.t  a/ is the time displacement3: O observed the
point Er after than O0 by a time a. Notice that the time intervals measured by O
and O0 are the same, 4t D 4t0.
Note that the Galilean transformations form a family parameterized by ten
parameters: E˛, EV, EC and a.
In the passive interpretation, the covariance (1.47) implies that in all inertial
frames the physical system obeys equations of motion of the same form. All inertial
observers, each using his own coordinates, will discover the same laws of motion
studying a given physical system, see Fig. 1.3a on the page 14. From a practical
point of view, O, who discovered Eq. (1.44), need not worry how to write them, if
he intends to use another inertial frame—they will be the same. For instance, this
has been already used in Example 2 of the previous section; see the discussion after
Eq. (1.30).
Active Point of View In this case .Er; t/ and .Er 0; t0/ are regarded as coordinates
of different space-time points in a given reference frame. Then (1.46) and (1.45)
represents the transformation that turns the primed point into an unprimed one.
For instance, imagine a physical system located in the vicinity of the observer’s
origin. Then the transformation (1.45) rotates it by R, displaces it over a distance
EC and makes it move with velocity EV. Besides, Eq. (1.46) means that the system is
considered by the observer at a later time.
3To see this, do the transformation in Newton’s equation with time-dependent potential U.t/.

1.2
Galilean Transformations: Principle of Galilean Relativity
15
In this interpretation, covariance means that two copies of a mechanical system,
related by the Galilean transformation, obey the same equations of motion, see
Fig. 1.3b on page 14. It implies that in this reference frame our space and time
look homogeneous as well as the fact that the space looks isotropic. Besides, a
mechanical system at rest and its copy in rectilinear motion along a straight line
have identical properties.
Let us summarize the discussion. Intuitively, the Galilean relativity princi-
ple (1.45), (1.46), and (1.47) can be summarized in two statements. First, different
inertial observers studying the same mechanical system will discover laws of motion
of the same form. Second, identical experiments made by inertial observers in their
laboratories will give identical results. Such properties as homogeneity and isotropy
are implicit in the second statement.
In relativistic mechanics the ideology remains the same. The only thing that
changes is the expression for the boost relating two frames in relative motion; see
the next section.
Structure of a Rotation Matrix An arbitrary 3  3 matrix a is determined by its
nine matrix elements aab. So, the set of matrices forms a nine-dimensional space
with coordinates aab. The rotation matrices form a subset deﬁned by the condition
RTR D 1;
or
RT D R1:
(1.49)
Let us represent R as composed of three columns, R D .Er1;Er2;Er3/. Then (1.49)
implies that Eri form an orthonormal set. We note

that is R rotates the three orthonormal vectors of the coordinate axis into the
orthonormal set Eri.
Since RTR is a symmetric matrix, the system (1.49) consists of six independent
equations. So the subset (1.49) can be parameterized by 9  6 D 3 coordinates
(intuitively, a rotation can be uniquely speciﬁed by the pointing of a vector E˛ D
.˛1; ˛2; ˛3/ directed along the rotation axis, with a length equal to the rotation
angle).
To parameterize the set (1.49), we use the standard procedure known from group
theory. We will need to use the exponential of a matrix. Given the matrix a, its
exponential ea is a matrix deﬁned by the power series

From the deﬁnition it follows that e0 D 1. Besides, if a is close to the null matrix,
then ea  1 C a, that is ea will be close to the unit matrix. It is known that the
exponential establishes an isomorphism of a neighborhood of a null matrix onto a
neighborhood of a unit matrix.
Let us try to represent a small rotation R in the form of the exponential of another
matrix: R D e!. The condition of orthogonality of R gives .e!/T D .e!/1, or
e!T D e!, or !T D !, that is, the matrix ! must be antisymmetric. Conversely,
any antisymmetric matrix generates an orthogonal matrix by an exponential map.

The matrices Ta which appeared in the formalism are called generators of rotations.
Since exponential is an isomorphism, the coordinates ˛a of the matrix ! can be
taken as coordinates of the orthogonal matrix as well, R D R.E˛/. They have a

R.E˛/E˛ D E˛, so E˛ is directed along the rotation axis.
This implies that, for instance, the matrix R D e˛3T3 represents a rotation around
the z-axis. To conﬁrm this by direct computation, note the properties

Poincaré and Lorentz Transformations: The Principle
of Special Relativity
A very economic and clear presentation of the special theory of relativity can be
found in [15, 16]. For a detailed discussion, see [17–19]. Here we only discuss
the principle that represents the starting point in the formulation of relativistic
mechanics.
Formulation of the Principle of Special Relativity Similarly to the Galilean
principle, the special relativity principle postulates the set of transformations (called
Poincaré transformations) relating space-time coordinates of inertial frames, and
states that laws of motion are covariant under the Poincaré transformations. The
only difference between Galilean and Poincaré transformations is in the expression
for the boost relating moving observers.
Poincaré Transformations Differentiation of the Galilean boost xa D x0a C Vat
gives a simple transformation rule for a particle velocity
Ev D Ev0 C EV:
(1.63)
The velocity of a particle seen by O is equal to the velocity seen by O0 plus the
relative velocity between the frames. This rule contradicts the Michelson–Morley
experiment, which shows that the velocity of propagation of a light front in a vacuum
is the same in all inertial frames! The numerical value of this universal constant is
c D 2998  1010 cm=s: According to the Michelson–Morley experiment, for the
case when both the light and the observer O0 move along the x-axis of the observer
O, we have c D c0 instead of Eq. (1.63).
Hence the Galilean boost is only approximately true, when velocity of the particle
and the relative velocity between the reference frames are small as compared with
this universal constant. We point out that this does not mean that relativistic effects
are always negligible at small velocities. For instance, a magnetic ﬁeld produced by
an electric current passing through a wire represents a pure relativistic effect; see
[20].
So, we are forced to replace the Galilean boost by another transformation,
which must satisfy two requirements. First, it must be consistent with the observer-
independence of the speed of light. Second, it must reduce to the Galilean boost
at the non-relativistic limit c ! 1. It is instructive to discuss the problem in a
more general setting, looking for the most general transformation consistent with
the observer-independence of the speed of light.
Consider the propagation of a light between two nearby closed points, separated
by dt, dxa in the O-frame. O writes the law of motion c2dt2 C .dxa/2 D 0, and
then computes the speed of light,
q
. dxa
dt /2 D c. Similarly, the observer O0 writes
c2dt02 C .dx0a/2 D 0, with the same c, in accordance with the Michelson–Morley
experiment. We look for the relation between t; Ex and t0; Ex0 which transform the ﬁrst

equation into the second one. To simplify the notation, it is convenient to unify time
and space coordinates into a single object x	 D .x0; xa/ D .ct; xa/, which labels
points of space-time (Minkowski space). So, any quantity endowed with a Greek
index has four components, 	 D 0; 1; 2; 3. The points of the Minkowski space often
called events, while curves are called worldlines. For instance, with the origin of the
laboratory O we associate the worldline .ct; E0/. We also introduce a 4  4-matrix

Inserting this result into Eq. (1.67) we get a restriction on the matrix ƒ

while those with a	 D 0 are called Lorentz transformations.
Thus we have obtained all the transformations that keep Eq. (1.66) invariant and
hence are consistent with the independence of the speed of light on a choice of
a reference frame. These are given by Eq. (1.68), where a	, 	 D 0; 1; 2; 3 are
arbitrary constants while ƒ	
 is a 4  4 matrix that obeys the restriction (1.69).
Equation (1.69) implies that ƒ D ˙1, so the Lorentz matrix is invertible. An
inverse matrix is denoted as Q, with the elements Qƒ	

. Multiplying (1.69) by 
from the left and by Qƒ from the right, it reads Qƒ D ƒT. So the inverse matrix

Hence in Minkowski geometry the up and down position of the four-dimensional
index of any quantity is ﬁxed and indicates the transformation law of the quan-
tity. Any index can be raised or lowered with the help of the Minkowski met-
ric, see (1.71). Our agreement (1.64) implies that, similarly to non-relativistic
mechanics, xa D xa for spatial components of x	. Another widely used agree-
ment is  D .C1; 1; 1; 1/, this leads to the less convenient rule, xa D

4x	4x
 D c2.4t/2  .4Er/2;
(1.73)
associated with the events x	 and x	 C 4x	, has the same value in all inertial
frames and is called Minkowski interval. This has direct physical meaning in two
cases. First, for two events which occur at the same point, the four-interval is
proportional to time interval, dt D  ds
c . Second, for simultaneous events the four-
interval coincides with distance, dl D ds.

1.3

The interval is called time-like if ds2 > 0. In the frame O0, which moves with
velocity Va D 4xa
4t with respect to O, the events happen at the same spatial point.
For the events separated by space-like interval, ds2 < 0, there is a frame where they
are simultaneous. The events of emission and absorbtion of a light signal have null
interval, ds2 D 0.
Vector (Tensor) Fields on Minkowski Space: Manifestly Covariant Equations
Consider the set
fv	.x

(1.74)
where v	.x
/ is a function representing a quantity in the frame O.x
/; v0	.x0

represents this quantity in O0.x0
/ and so on. The set is called a contravariant vector
ﬁeld if
v0	.x0/ D ƒ	
v
.x/;
(1.75)
where the coordinates x0	, x	 are related by the Poincaré transformation (1.68).
Similarly, a covariant vector ﬁeld is deﬁned by the transformation law
!0
	.x0/ D !
.x/ Qƒ
	:
(1.76)
To every contravariant quantity there corresponds a covariant one, which is obtained
by lowering the up-index with help of the metric, and vice-versa. Quantities
equipped with more than one index are called tensor ﬁelds. For example, the third-
rank contravariant tensor is deﬁned by the transformation law
s0	
.x0/ D ƒ	˛ƒ
ˇƒs˛ˇ.x/;
(1.77)
while the second-rank covariant tensor transforms as
s0

(1.78)
Finally, a quantity without indexes that transforms as
'0.x0/ D '.x/;
(1.79)
is called a scalar function.
Equation (1.69) can be written as 	
 D ˛ˇ Qƒ˛	 Qƒˇ
, so the Minkowski metric
represents a special example of an x-independent tensor ﬁeld that has the same
components in all reference frames. The Minkowski space admits one more x-
independent tensor with similar property, called Levi-Civita symbol, 	
ı. It is
deﬁned as follows. It is antisymmetric in any pair of indexes, so in the frame
O.x	/ is completely determined by 0123 D 1. Due to its antisymmetry, it obeys

det ƒ D 1, we take 00123 D 1 in the frame O0. If det ƒ D 1, we deﬁne 00123 D 1
in the frame O0. Then the transformation law
0	
ı D ƒ	˛ƒ

3. Contraction of indexes can also be used to construct new tensors. For

tensor, while t	
v	v is a covariant vector.

Similarly, a derivative of a tensor is a tensor as well. For example, @	@
t
represents a third-rank covariant tensor.
Equations (1.75), (1.76), (1.77), (1.78), and (1.79) clearly show that the scalar,
vector and tensor quantities can be used for the construction of covariant equations.
For instance, if s	
 is a tensor, then s	
 D 0 represents a manifestly covariant
equation: if an observer O discovered a law s	
 D 0, all inertial observers can use
this tensor to write the law in their laboratories.
Structure of the Poincaré Transformation Similarly to the Galilean transforma-
tion, the Poincaré one is speciﬁed by ten parameters. So, let us compare them, to get
an idea about the structure of Poincaré transformations (1.68) and (1.69).
1. There are four translations presented, x0	 D x	 C a	, just as in the Galilean case,
t0 D t C a, x0a D xa C ca. Six more parameters are necessary to label the Lorentz
matrix ƒ

Then Eq. (1.69) acquires the form ƒkiƒkj D ıij, that is, the 3  3-block ƒij
is the orthogonal matrix. The corresponding transformation represents a spacial
rotation
x00 D x0;
x0i D ƒi

3. Matrices with ƒ0i; ƒi0 ¤ 0 produce a transformation that can be compared with
the Galilean boost (which is written on the r.h.s. below)

The spatial part, Eq. (1.89), is similar to the Galilean boost, but it is accompanied
by the time boost, Eq. (1.88). This ultimately implies that both spacial and time
intervals between two events look different for observers in relative motion.
It is this part of the Poincaré group which essentially differ from the Galilean
one.

Mechanical Covariants and Invariants Poincaré transformations of the coordi-

transformation law of the functions xa.t/ which describe the evolution of a system.
The problem is that the induced transformations are higher nonlinear ones (see
Sect. 7.4). While the relativistic equations of motion can be formulated in terms
of xa.t/, the Poincaré covariance of such a formulation is not under control. The
conventional way to avoid the problem is as follows.
With the function xa.t/ we associate the set of points M.x	/ of Minkowski space
with the coordinates x0 D ct, xa D xa.t/. Let us introduce parametric equations of
the resulting worldline

We have seen that the sum of kinetic and potential energy is an important quantity
characterizing a physical system. Surprisingly enough, their difference, T  U, also
plays a very special role, being a basic quantity used in the formulation of the least
action principle. In modern mechanics this underlies equations of motion.

Fig. 1.6 The variational problem is formulated on a class of curves with the same initial and ﬁnal
points
that join two given points over the time interval chosen; see Fig. 1.6 on page 30. We
restrict ourselves to this class of curves.
According to the principle of least action (or Hamilton’s principle), with a
mechanical system can be associated a Lagrangian function L. The system moves
between two given points along the curve that provides the minimum of the
Lagrangian action.
This statement of the existence of a Lagrangian is rather general. In particular, for
a mechanical system that obeys the Hamiltonian equations of motion (see below),
the existence of a Lagrangian function can be proved. While in some cases it
requires the use of rather sophisticated methods, Lagrangians have been found
for most fundamental equations of mathematical physics. Hence they follow the
principle of least action.
To provide the minimum, qa./ must obey certain second-order differential
equations constructed in terms of L. While we discuss this in the next section, it
may be instructive to carry out an intuitive computation that illustrates a relationship
between the quantity L and equations of motion. Take the harmonic oscillator with
L D 1

and with the same initial and ﬁnal points. This implies ıx.t1/ D ıx.t2/ D 0. Let us
compute the variation of the function L for the two curves in a linear order on ıx
(that is, the differential) at a ﬁxed t; see Fig. 1.6 on page 30. We obtain

Let us summarize the results. According to the least action principle, the true
trajectory of a physical system is a minimum of the variational problem with a
properly chosen Lagrangian. In turn, the extremum qa./ obeys the Lagrangian
equations (1.129). Combining these statements we arrive at
Assertion The time evolution of a system described by the Lagrangian L.q; Pq; / is
governed by the Lagrangian equations (1.129).

As has been mentioned above, this implies causal dynamics, as should be the case
for a classical-mechanics system. So, in classical mechanics we usually deal with
non-singular systems (while a system with holonomic constraints can be formulated
in terms of a singular Lagrangian as well, see Sect. 1.6.3). Singularity is a typical
property of manifestly relativistic theories. The formalism of classical mechanics
for singular theories is discussed in some detail in Chap. 8.

Generalized Coordinates, Coordinate Transformations
and Symmetries of an Action
A change of coordinates is one of the powerful methods used for studying equations
of motion. In this section we show that it can be carried out directly in an action
functional instead of in equations of motion (in many cases this turns out to be
much more economic procedure).
We recall that a functional is an operation deﬁned on a given class of functions,
so we should to decide how the functions and the functional change under the
transformation of coordinates. Here we present rather intuitive discussion of the
subject. A more consistent treatment will be given in Chap. 7.

This implies an elegant mathematical reinterpretation of the initial problem with N

in abstract 3N dimensional space. It is called the conﬁguration space of the system,
while qa are called generalized coordinates (more generally, they are any coordinate
system of the conﬁguration space).
Recall that Euclidean space has natural metrical properties, that is, we are able
to deﬁne the distance between points, the length of a curve and magnitude of a
vector, angles between vectors and so on. For two points with coordinates qa
1, qa

distance is

Equation (1.151) shows that equations of motion in Cartesian and non-Cartesian
coordinates generally have different forms. As an example, compare the Carte-
sian (1.31) and polar (1.167) equations of the Kepler‘s problem. In particular, in
non-Cartesian coordinates may appear velocity-dependent terms.
Metric of Conﬁguration Space The matrix gab.q0/ which appears in the action has
a simple geometric interpretation.6 To see this, let us consider two inﬁnitesimally
closed points of conﬁguration space with coordinates q0a and q0a C dq0a. Using the
transition function (1.146), their coordinates in the Cartesian system read qa.q0/ and
qa.q0 C dq0/. Let us compute the expression for the distance (1.143) in coordinates
q0. Expanding the transition function qa.q0 C dq0/ in a power series up to the ﬁrst

Hence, to compute distances (and hence other metrical quantities) in coordinates q0,
we need to know the matrix gab.q0/. So, gab plays the same role in the coordinates q0a
as ıab in the Cartesian system: it determines the metrical properties of the space in
the coordinates q0. It is called the metric of conﬁguration space in the coordinates q0.
The length of a vector and of a line can be obtained from (1.144), (1.145) replacing

Coordinate transformations with these property are called global symmetry of the
action. Thus the six-parameter family (1.155) is a symmetry of the action (1.156).
Generalizing this example, let us consider a family of coordinate transformations
qa D qa.q0b; !˛/;
(1.158)
where !˛, ˛ D 1; 2; : : : ; k are parameters. Generally, the transformed Lagrangian
L0 (deﬁned in (1.147)) as a function of its arguments is different from L, L0.q0; Pq0/ ¤
L.q; Pq/jq!q0 (for instance, the Eq. (1.151) clearly shows this). But if it coincides
with L or differs on the total derivative term

then, up to boundary term, the transformed action has the same form the initial one

Then the family of coordinate transformations (1.158) is called the global symmetry
of the action with k parameters. The action is called invariant under the transforma-
tions (up to a boundary term).
When a transformation represents the symmetry, it is not necessary to carry out
computations to obtain equations of motion in the new coordinates, for they appear

This is an equation of a conic section (1.37) in polar coordinates (the ellipse

integrated out giving the law of evolution of the particle, r.t/. With this

These have complicated right-hand sides that depend on all six variables of
the problem. To improve this, notice that introducing the vector Er D Er2Er1,
we simplify the potential term in the action. So let us deﬁne the relative

(1.178)
The center-of-mass “particle” moves with constant velocity along the
straight line, ER.t/ D ER0 C EVt. Er-particle moves in the central ﬁeld, so
we have the Kepler problem (1.30). Its trajectory is a conic section on the
plane orthogonal to the vector of angular momentum EL D mŒEr; PEr D const.
Let it be an ellipse with the semi-axis a and b. Given vectors ER.t/, Er.t/, the
evolution of true particles is obtained according to Eq. (1.175) or (1.176)
Er1 D ER C Er 0
1;
Er2 D ER C Er 0

(1.179)
So, dynamics of the particle with the radius-vector Er1 is a composition of
two motions: the vector Er 0
1 moves on the plane of ellipse Er, while the plane
moves in the direction of EV.
A qualitative picture of motion of the particles Er 0

as follows. Comparing (1.177) and (1.176) we have
Er 0

1-particle is the ellipse of the Er-particle
suppressed by the factor
m2
m1Cm2 , which has the semi-axis
m2a
m1Cm2 ,
m2b
m1Cm2 . For
the Er 0
2-particle, the ellipse is suppressed by
m1
m1Cm2 . According to (1.180),
Er 0
1 and Er 0
2 are antiparallel at any instant. Hence the trajectories of these
particles are ellipses with one focus at the center of mass and with parallel
semi-major axis. At each instant of motion, a straight line connecting the
particles passes through the center of mass; see Fig. 1.10 on page 45.
A cartesian system with center at the point ER.t/ is called center-mass
coordinate system, see Fig. 1.9 on page 45. Transformation between the
initial and center of mass coordinates is given by Galilean transformation
Er.t/ D Er 0.t/ C ER0 C EVt.

Examples of Continuous (Field) Systems
While initially formalism of classical mechanics has been developed for ﬁnite-
dimensional systems, many of its methods can be generalized for the description
of physical systems with an inﬁnite (non-countable) number of degrees of freedom.
In this case the conﬁguration of a system is determined by a function of the space-
time point, say 'B.; xa/, B D 1; 2; : : : ; n called a ﬁeld. Hence to determine an
instantaneous conﬁguration we need to specify n numbers 'A, at each point of space.
Here we present a few illustrative examples of the ﬁeld systems, and outline the
relevant results of variational analysis that will be used later.
Small Oscillations of a Non-stretchable String Consider a non-stretchable string
of length L and linear mass density . The string is ﬁxed at one end but can slide
without friction at the other end; see Fig. 1.11 on page 47. It is under the constant
force T applied to the free end (imagine the mass M hanged on that end, then T D
Mg/. T is called the string tension. The tension acts as a return force when the string
is replaced out of its position of equilibrium.
The conﬁguration of the string can be described by the displacement function
'.t; x/; see Fig. 1.11 on page 47. It is an example of a continuous system:
instantaneous conﬁguration is determined by the function '.x/, x 2 Œ0; L instead
of a set of numbers qa. Intuitively, it is convenient to imagine that we deal with an
inﬁnite number of coordinates 'x.t/  '.x; t/ labeled by a “continuous index” x
instead of qa.t/ with the discrete index a.
To write an action, we consider the approximation of a small oscillation, '  L,
of the light string, L  M, and suppose that points of the string can move in a
vertical direction only.
The potential energy is equal to the work performed by the force T in the
displacement of the mass M, U D Th, where h is the difference of lengths of

A Continuous System as a Limit of a Discrete One To study longitudinal
vibrations of an elastic pivot, we ﬁrst approximate it by a chain of N particles
connected by springs. The description of the pivot arises at the limit N ! 1.
Note that this gives an intuitive explanation why the methods ﬁrst developed for a
system with a ﬁnite number of degrees of freedom work for continuous systems as
well.
Starting from a spring chain of N particles (see Example 2 of Sect. 1.4.1) let us
try to ﬁnd the limit when the number of particles on the ﬁxed interval Œ0; .N 1/4x
tends to inﬁnity, N ! 1 (this implies 4x ! 0/. In the process, we also vary the

changing its form, that is, it behaves like a particle.
The wave equation is linear, that is, it has the property that any linear combination
of solutions is itself a solution. For instance, the solution ' D F.ct  x/ C F.ct C x/
describes two packets travelling in opposite directions; see Fig. 1.13b on page 51.
During the interval t <  
c they approach one another; then they “scatter” near the
point x D 0 during the interval  

c ; and then diverge, keeping their initial
proﬁles unaltered after the scattering. Linearity of the wave equation will be spoiled
when we include in the action interaction terms (like '3; '4; : : :/. This would lead
to non-trivial scattering effects.
Note that the solutions have been obtained without taking into account any type
of boundary conditions. So, they correspond to the case of an inﬁnite string.

Action of a Constrained System
While the Lagrangian function can often be written as the difference between kinetic
and potential energy, L D T  U, this rule is not universal. There are a lot of rather
simple systems when it does not work. Take, for example, a mathematical pendulum
on a plane, see Fig. 1.15 on page 54. It is clear that the difference

being considered as the system Lagrangian, leads to wrong equations of motion.
These describe a free fall in a gravitational ﬁeld, and do not take into account the
constraint x2 C y2 D l2 that must be satisﬁed at any instant of motion. Note also
that it is impossible to simply add the constraint to the equations of motion, since it
would lead to an incompatible system (conﬁrm this!).

The Recipe
The pendulum is an example of a system with a holonomic (or kinematic) constraint
(generally, a holonomic constraint is an algebraic restriction on variables of
conﬁguration space, G.qa; / D 0, that must be satisﬁed at any instant). In this
section we discuss a recipe suitable for the construction of a Lagrangian for this
case.
Roughly speaking it can be formulated as follows. First, forget the constraints,
and write the Lagrangian of the unconstrained system (it may be L D T  U/.
Second, ﬁnd a solution to constraints and write L in terms of the independent
variables.
For the pendulum, one possibility is y D 

Let us discuss the recipe from the geometric point of view. Possible positions of the
pendulum lie on the circle (one-dimensional subspace of the plane) x2 C y2 D l2.
In the vicinity of the point .0; l/ we are interested in, the variable x can be taken
as a coordinate of the subspace. So the recipe consist of restriction of unconstrained
Lagrangian function on the subspace.

1.6
Action of a Constrained System
55
It is important to notice a freedom implied by the recipe. First, we are free to
choose the parametrization of the subspace. Take, for example, the angle  as a
coordinate. Then the parametric equations of the circle are x D l sin , y D l cos .
They solve the constraint, so can be used in (1.203). This gives a Lagrangian in terms
of 
L./ D 1
2ml2 P2 C mgl cos ;
(1.207)
and the equation of motion is
R C g
l sin  D 0:
(1.208)
For a small  one approximates sin    obtaining the equation of harmonic
oscillations for , R C g
l  D 0.
Second, we could use the generalized coordinates writing an anzatz (1.203) for
L. This can be done, for example, in polar coordinates x D r sin , y D r cos ,
which gives L.r; / D 1
2m.Pr2 Cr2 P2/Cmgr cos . Then we use the constraint r D l
obtaining Eqs. (1.207) and (1.208) once again.

For later use, we specify the results for a particular case of parametrization of the

with respect to .n  k/ variables among qa, say qi. Let the solution be

a vertical plane.

Justiﬁcation of the Recipe
Holonomic constraints represent the idealization of a very strong force directed
towards a surface of conﬁguration space, and forcing a particle to move near
the surface. This suggests a natural way [2] to conﬁrm the recipe (1.212) for

1.6

Lagrangian of the constrained-system.8 We start from a system with a potential
that produces the strong force (among others), and then take the limit of inﬁnite
force. Since the dimension of the conﬁguration space is not essential for the
discussion, we take a system with two generalized coordinates x, y and with the
action being

This depends on the parameter s Dconst. To put this in concrete terms, we
suppose U
 0 in the region of interest. The second term of the potential
energy grows when the particle goes away from the line y D g.x/. We con-
sider a particle that starts on that line and has initial velocity tangent to the
line

Px.0/ D v0;
y.0/ D g.x0/;
Py.0/ D Pg.x0/:
(1.225)
Let us show that at the limit s ! 1, an action describing a particle in potential U
and subject to the constraint y D g.x/ appears.

Description of Constrained System by Singular Action
To describe a constrained system, our ideology was to reduce the number of
variables, from qa; a D 1; 2; : : : ; n to s˛, ˛ D 1; 2; : : : k < n. Unfortunately, this
can result in the loss of some properties that were presented in the initial variables.
For example, both the unconstrained action (1.219) and the constraints (1.218)
of the Thomson-Tait pendulum have a manifest rotational symmetry9 Er ! REr. This
is hidden in the formulation (1.221) (in which only the rotational symmetry in the
.x; y/-plane, ' ! ' C const is evident).
The same happens if we use some of the initial variables to parameterize the
constraint surface. For example, take a free particle on a circle of radius l. Both
the unconstrained Lagrangian

2m.Px2 C Py2/ and the constraint x2 C y2 D l2
have the rotation symmetry Er ! REr. This is not manifest in the Lagrangian

Since symmetries often play a fundamental role in the analysis of a theory, it
would be desirable to ﬁnd a way to keep them untouched. This implies that we
continue to use the initial variables of conﬁguration space for the description of
a constrained system. Strange as it may seem, this can be achieved following the
opposite ideology: instead of reducing the conﬁguration space we extend it, adding
new variables into the formulation.
As before, we take a system with an unconstrained Lagrangian L.qa; Pqa/ and the
constraints Gi.qa/ D 0, i D 1; 2; : : : ; n  k. Introduce .2n  k/-dimensional space
with the independent coordinates qa; i, and consider the action


L.qa; Pqa/ C iGi.qa/

(1.231)
Since the initial coordinates are untouched, the formulation does not spoil the
symmetry properties of a theory. The price we pay is the appearance of the additional
variables i that have no direct physical interpretation. They do not participate in
determining the conﬁguration of the system (positions, velocities, energies of the
9Generally, a symmetry is called manifest if it is expressed by a linear transformation.

1.6
Action of a Constrained System
63
particles and so on). So we can not (and need not!) measure them. For this reason
they are called unphysical (or auxiliary) degrees of freedom.
In all other respects, we treat the auxiliary variables on equal footing with others.
In particular, we write and solve equations of motion for both qa and i.
Since the action does not contain derivatives of , it represents an example of a
singular theory. The Hessian matrix has vanishing blocks,
@2S
@Pi@Pj D 0,
@2S
@Pi@Pqa D 0.
So its rank is less than dimension 2n  k of extended space.
We demonstrate now that the new formulation (1.231) implies the same evolution
for qa as the old one (1.212). Hence they are equivalent. It will be convenient to write
separately equations of motion for the variables qi and q˛ (these were described in
Eq. (1.215)). Applying the principle of least action, we ﬁnd

Note that the constraints (1.234) appeared as a part of equations of motion. From
this system we get closed equations for q˛. They can be obtained as follows. We
suppose that the solution qi D qi.q˛/ of (1.234) has been substituted into (1.232)
and (1.233). Differentiation of the identity Gj.qi.q˛/; q˛/ D 0 gives @Gj

To be sure of the self-consistency of the new formulation, let us discuss the
structure of solutions of the entire system (1.236), (1.233) and (1.234). The last of
these equations has been already solved by qi.q˛/. Let q˛ D q˛./ be a solution
to (1.236). We substitute the functions q˛./, qi.q˛.// into Eq. (1.233). This
gives an algebraic equation for determining i. Since by construction det @Gj

Eq. (1.233) can be resolved with respect to i. Note a consequence: since all i

Kinetic Versus Potential Energy: Forceless Mechanics

Here we discuss one more example of using an auxiliary variable. In this case, it
allows us to reformulate potential motion in n-dimensional conﬁguration space as
a free fall in (ﬁctitious) space of n C 1-dimensions. This explains the terminology
“forceless mechanics” for the new formulation developed by H. Hertz [21].

PqnC1 D 2cU.qa/:
(1.244)
Initial condition for PqnC1 implies c D 1. Substituting the result, PqnC1 D 2U,
into (1.243) we obtain Eq. (1.238) of the initial formulation.
In the new formulation the potential energy acquires a geometric origin. Recall
that according to Sect. 1.4.2, the metric that appears in Eq. (1.239) has a certain
geometric interpretation: it determines distances between points of conﬁguration
space. As will be explained in Chap. 6, trajectories of a theory with such an action
also have a remarkable geometric interpretation: they represent lines of minimal
length with respect to the metric gij. Hence they are similar to straight lines of
Euclidean space and are called geodesic lines. It is known that trajectories of
particles in general relativity theory have the same property. So, the motion of the
qi-particle described by (1.239) is analogous to free fall in a gravitational ﬁeld. An
intuitive picture of motion in the new formulation is presented in Fig. 1.21 on page
66. A ﬁctitious qi-particle moves freely along the shortest line of .nC1/-dimensional
space with the metric gij.U/. Physical trajectory is its projection on conﬁguration
space qa and corresponds to potential motion, with the potential being U.qa/.
Since qnC1 represents an auxiliary variable, we are not able to experimentally
ﬁx its initial condition qnC1
0
. Fortunately, this does not lead to inconsistency: since
equations for qa and qnC1 have been separated, different choices of qnC1
0
imply the
same physical dynamics, which is given by (1.238). Geometrically, the solutions
qi; yi; : : : in extended space that correspond to different choices of qnC1
0
project on
the same physical trajectory qa, see Fig. 1.21 on page 66.
Although we have discussed the case of a scalar potential, the construction can be
adapted for the vector potential as well. An example of a force with a vector potential
is electromagnetic force (with the vector potential being A	). Being appropriately
generalized for that case, the construction leads to the Kaluza–Klein theory, which
formally uniﬁes four-dimensional gravity and electromagnetism into a unique ﬁve-
dimensional theory [22].

Electromagnetic Field in Lagrangian Formalism
Here we apply Lagrangian formalism to the analysis of Maxwell equations describ-
ing electric and magnetic phenomena. While it is not evident in the initial formu-
lation, Maxwell equations obey the principle of special relativity, that is they are
covariant under the Poincaré transformations. We start from a description of an
electromagnetic ﬁeld in terms of a three-dimensional vector potential. In this case
electrodynamics can be formulated on a base of nonsingular Lagrangian action.
Like the Maxwell equations themselves, this three-dimensional formalism is not
manifestly Poincaré invariant. We then go on to discuss the manifestly invariant
formulation. This is achieved in terms of a four-dimensional vector potential and
implies the use of singular Lagrangian action.

Examples of Solutions
1. Electric ﬁeld of a point charge. Consider the charge q at rest at the origin
of a coordinate system. Then EJ D 0, while the charge density can be
described as  D qı3.Ex/, where ı3.Ex/ is the Dirac ı-function. Then the
total charge is Q D
R
d3x D q. Maxwell equations with these densities
are solved by
EE D qEx

.then jEEj D jqj

EB D 0:
(1.250)
This is the Coulomb law: the electric ﬁeld of a point charge is spherically
symmetric, directed from positive charge (proton) to inﬁnity, with its
magnitude equal to the inverse square of the distance to the charge.
When Ex ¤ 0, the direct computation gives @a
qxa
jExj3 D 0. So the Maxwell
equation . Er; EE/ D qı3.Ex/ is satisﬁed for any Ex ¤ 0. For Ex D 0 it holds
as an equality among generalized functions, that is we multiply both sides
of @a

jExj3 D qı3.x/ on a test function f.x/ and integrate over space. Using
integration by parts, the result is 

the point Ex, and then take the limit  ! 0. See, [23] for details. The ﬁeld
of a moving charge will be obtained in Sect. 1.7.8.

Sect. 1.5), the E-wave in the .x1; x2/-plane, and the B-wave in the .x1; x3/-
plane; see Fig. 1.22b on page 68. When the amplitude of EE decreases, the
amplitude of EB increases and vice versa. In particular, at the instances t D
k
c! we have EE D 0, EB D ˙D cos.!x1/. That is, when EE vanishes, EB has
its maximum amplitude at each space point. Intuitively, the ﬁelds EE and EB
turn into one another during the time evolution.

Consistency Condition: Conservation of Charge Maxwell equations imply an
important consistency condition on , EJ called the continuity equation. To ﬁnd it,
take the divergence of both sides of Eq. (1.245). Using the identity . Er; Œ Er; EB/ D 0
as well as Eq. (1.247), we obtain
@t C . Er; EJ/ D 0:
(1.254)
So, the charge and current densities can not be taken as arbitrary, but must obey the
continuity equation. To see the meaning of this, we write it in the integral form. Let
us integrate both sides of the continuity equation over a volume V surrounded by
the closed surface S

The last equality is due to the Gauss theorem. So we have
@tQV D 
Z
S
.EJ; EdS/;
(1.256)
where QV stands for the charge contained in the volume V. Hence the continuity
equation states that an electric charge must be locally conserved: the rate of variation
of a charge in a volume is equal to its ﬂow (amount of charge that leaves or enters
through the surface per unit of time).
If we integrate over all space, the right-hand side vanishes owing to EJ

(charges can not escape to inﬁnity). Then @tQ D 0, that is, the total electric charge
is conserved.
1.7.2
Nonsingular Lagrangian Action of Electrodynamics
The aim of this section is to show that electromagnetic forces can be described in
terms of a unique vector ﬁeld (called a three-dimensional vector potential EA) instead
of EE, EB. The vector potential obeys a second-order partial differential equation,
which can be obtained by applying the least action principle to a nonsingular
Lagrangian action. The ﬁelds EE and EB can be restored from given EA.
According to Maxwell, an electromagnetic ﬁeld is described by six functions EE,
EB subject to eight equations. There are six equations of the ﬁrst order with respect
to time, (1.245) and (1.246). Two more Eqs. (1.247) and (1.248) do not involve the
time derivative and hence represent the ﬁeld analogy of kinematic constraints. We
ﬁrst reduce the number of equations from 8 to 6. A speciﬁc property of the Maxwell
system is that the constraint equations can be replaced by properly-chosen initial

This is equivalent to the problem (1.245), (1.246), (1.247), and (1.248). Any solution
to (1.245), (1.246), (1.247), and (1.248) satisﬁes the Eqs. (1.257), (1.258), (1.259).
Conversely, let EE, EB be the solution to the problem (1.257), (1.258), and (1.259).
Taking the divergence of Eq. (1.257), we obtain the consequence @t. Er; EE/ C

arrive at Eq. (1.248).
To proceed further, it is convenient to unify the vectors EE, EB into the complex

of the Maxwell equations. EA is called a (three-dimensional) vector potential of the

Conversely, any given solution EE, EB of the Maxwell equations can be used to

The existence of the solution K is guaranteed by the Eq. (1.259). By direct
substitution, we can verify that the ﬁeld constructed obeys the Eqs. (1.265), (1.262)
and (1.263).
For the stationary electromagnetic ﬁeld, @t EE D @tEB D 0, the Eq.(1.246) turns

the potentials A	 and A0

the Eq. (1.286) reduce to the system (1.277) obtained in the previous section,13 while
the action (1.287) turns into (1.270).
The procedure described is called ﬁxation of a gauge. The condition A0 D 0 is
known as a unitary gauge.
To make the relationship between .EE; EB/ and A	 clearer, we deﬁne an equivalence
relation on the space of functions A	.x
/. The potentials A	 and A0
	 are equivalent,
A0
	 	 A	, if they differ by the divergence of some function, A0
	 D A	 C @	˛.
Equivalent potentials form a set called a class of equivalent potentials. The set is
denoted by QA	 D fA	 C @	˛, where ˛ is an arbitrary function}. According to
the known theorems of algebra, given the equivalence relation, the initial space
decomposes on non-intersecting classes of equivalent potentials, see Fig. 1.23 on
page 77. Electromagnetic ﬁelds are in one-to-one correspondence with the classes,
.EE; EB/ $ QA	. As we have discussed, in each class there is a representative of the
form .0; Aa/. Fixation of the unitary gauge means that solving equations of motion
we look for a representative of this special form in each class.
Another often-used gauge is the Lorentz gauge, @	A	 D 0. One of its advantages
is that it does not spoil the manifest Poincaré covariance of the problem. Another
advantage is that in this gauge the left hand side of Eq. (1.286) acquires the form of
a wave equation (see Sect. 1.5)

The action (1.287) also reﬂects the ambiguity in the representation of EE and EB
through a potential: it has the same value for all representatives of a given class.
Indeed, the substitution
A	 D A0
	  @	˛;
(1.292)
leaves the action (1.287) invariant, SŒA.A0/ D SŒA0. So it represents a symmetry
transformation on the space of ﬁelds. In contrast to the global Poincaré symmetry
discussed above, the symmetry (1.292) involves an arbitrary function ˛.x	/ instead
of numeric parameter. Intuitively, the transformation law varies from one point
to another, transformations of a potential “here” and “there” are different. For
this reason the transformation is called local (or gauge) symmetry of the action.
In what follows we discuss some characteristic properties of locally-invariant
theories.

and we deal with a singular theory.
Arbitrariness in Solutions of Locally-Invariant Theory Recall that a nonsingu-
lar theory leads to a normal system of equations, which admits formulation of the
Cauchy problem. This is impossible in a locally-invariant theory: independently of
the type and the number of initial and boundary conditions imposed, a solution
to the equations of locally-invariant theory is not unique, and involves arbitrary
functions. Indeed, suppose that A	 represents a solution to the Eq. (1.286) with
some initial and boundary conditions imposed. Take a function ˛.x
/ such that @	˛
(together with its time derivatives, if necessary), vanishes at the initial instance
and on the boundary. Then A	 C @	˛ is a solution of the same problem as
A	.
Structure of Equations of Motion One consequence of singularity is that not all
equations of motion are of the second order with respect to a temporal variable. Let

There is a profound relationship between the properties enumerated above and

Lorentz Transformations of Three-Dimensional
Potential: Role of Gauge Symmetry
So far was not demonstrated that the formulation of electrodynamics in terms of
the three-dimensional potential Ab obeys the principle of special relativity. Here
we present the relevant computation. The computation also clariﬁes, why we
prefer the formalism which implies a set of redundant variables subject to local
transformations instead of a set of independent and gauge-invariant variables.
Consider two observers related by the Lorentz transformation x0	 D ƒ	
x
.
Suppose they study a given electromagnetic ﬁeld. As we have seen, the four-
dimensional potentials are related by combination of the Lorentz and the gauge
transformations
A0
	 D A
 Qƒ
	 C @	˛:
(1.298)
Suppose the observers decided to use a three-dimensional formalism to describe
the given ﬁeld. Then O describes it by the potential A	 D .A0 D 0; Aa/, while O0
uses A0
	 D .A0
0 D 0; A0
a/. The question is if the formalism is a Lorentz covariant,
that is, whether the two descriptions are related by a Lorentz transformation. It is
clear that the linear Lorentz transformation of four-dimensional formulation does

Sketch of Lagrangian Formalism
not relate these A0 and A, since transformation of .0; Aa/ leads to a potential with
A0
0 D Ab Qƒb0 ¤ 0. A general gauge transformation also implies A0
0 ¤ 0.
It can be said that neither the Lorentz nor the gauge symmetry of four-
dimensional formulation survive in the gauge A0 D 0. But we can look for
a combination that does not spoil the gauge condition. So, given the Lorentz
transformation Qƒ, we ask whether there is a ˛. Qƒ/ such that A0
0 D 0.
Taking 	 D 0-component of Eq. (1.298) and requiring A0
0 D 0, we ﬁnd
˛. Qƒ/ D Cc Qƒc0, where Cc is a primitive function of Ac, @0Cc D Ac. Then the
three-dimensional potentials are related by
A0
b D Ac Qƒc
b  @bCc Qƒc
0:
(1.299)
The transformation turns out to be highly non-linear (even non local with respect to
Aa!), involving the primitive function Cc of the potential.
This computation shows the role of auxiliary variables and local symmetries
associated with them. Introducing the auxiliary variable A0, we arrive at the
formulation where the non-linearly realized global symmetry (1.299) decomposes
on a linear global symmetry (Lorentz transformations) plus a local symme-
try, (1.298).

1.7.7
Speed of Light and Critical Speed in External Field
We will use the following terminology. The speed vcr that a particle can not
exceed during its evolution in an external ﬁeld is called critical speed.14 The
observer-independent scale c of special relativity is called, as usual, the speed of
light. We show that the particle (1.309) can not exceed c during its evolution in
electromagnetic ﬁeld, that is its critical speed coincides with the speed of light. Then
we consider rather exotic examples of equations which yield vcr different from c. We
achieve this assuming a non-minimal interaction with electromagnetic ﬁeld. These
toy models have the same basic properties as the Eq. (1.309): reparametrization and
gauge-invariance, as well as Poincaré-covariance. In Chap.9 this subject will be
discussed for more realistic case of a particle with spin.
Particle with Minimal Interaction Due to the relativistic-contraction factor c2 
v2 D 0, the Eq. (1.309) became singular at the value of speed v D c. The singularity
determines behavior of the particle in ultra-relativistic limit. To see this, we rewrite
the equations in the form of second law of Newton and analyze an acceleration. We
present (1.311) as follows:

ﬁeld-dependent quantity, see below.

(1.314)
The same expression can be obtained computing the time-derivative in Eq. (1.310).
The acceleration vanishes as jvj ! c. Hence the singularity in Eq. (1.309) implies
that during its evolution in the external ﬁeld, our particle can not exceed the speed
of light c.
Particle with Non minimal Interaction The ﬁeld strength F	
 can be used to
modify the Eq. (1.309) preserving its basic properties: reparametrization and gauge-
invariance, as well as Poincaré-covariance. We discuss two modiﬁcations which
could yield non vanishing longitudinal acceleration as jvj ! c. First, we replace
the usual relativistic factor PxPx by

four-force obeys the identity Px	f 	 D 0, we have two special points, jvj D c, and v0
determined from PxgPx D 0. In absence of the identity, and if Px	f 	 ¤ 0 as jvj ! c,
the speed of light does not represent a special point of (1.317).
If Qk D 0, we obtain
va D e.vE/

(1.318)

by PxgPx D 0. This surface is slightly different from the sphere c2  v2 D 0.

1.7
Electromagnetic Field in Lagrangian Formalism
85
So the second special point generally differs from the speed of light. To see this
in more detail, we compute the last term in (1.315)

(1.319)

(1.321)
If E and B are not mutually parallel in the laboratory system, this expression does
not vanish for any orientation of v. This implies that the factor (1.315) does not
vanish at jvj D c.
We conﬁrmed that longitudinal acceleration generally vanishes at two different
values of speed, c and v0. Then Eq. (1.318) implies the following possibilities.
(A) Let  D C1, then from (1.320) we conclude c < v0, and speed of the particle
approximates to c. The second special point v0 turns out to be irrelevant. So
vcr D c.
(B) Let  D 1, then v0 < c, and the particle with small initial velocity will
approximate to the critical velocity vcr D v0 < c. So it never approximates to
the speed of light.
Consider now the case Qk ¤ 0, and the factor (1.315) with  D C1. As we have
seen above, this implies c < v0, where v0 is a solution of PxgPx D 0. Besides, we take
non-parallel, homogeneous and non-stationary ﬁelds with growing tension
@iE D @iB D 0;
d
dtjEj > 0;
d

(1.322)
then the longitudinal acceleration of the particle (1.316) reads

(1.323)
We have a1.c/ D 0, while a2.c/ is positive according to Eqs. (1.319) and (1.322). So
the particle overcomes the light barrier. In the region c < v < v0 we have a1.v/ < 0
and a2.v/ > 0, so the particle will continue to accelerate up to critical velocity vcr
determined by the equation a1 C a2 D 0. If a2 > ja1j in the region, the particle will
accelerate up to the value vcr D v0. Above this velocity the Eq. (1.323) becomes
meaningless.

The toy examples show that critical speed in a manifestly relativistic and
reparametrization-invariant theory does not always coincide with the speed of light,
if we assume the usual special-relativity deﬁnitions of time and distance. In general
case, we expect that vcr is a ﬁeld-dependent quantity.

Chapter 2
Hamiltonian Formalism
Abstract As we have discussed, Lagrangian formulation of classical mechanics is
based on Euler–Lagrange (Newton) equations of motion, which represent a system
of second-order differential equations, written for a set of variables that describe
the position of a physical system of interest. Hamiltonian formulation suggests
an equivalent description in terms of ﬁrst-order equations written for independent
variables describing the position and velocity of the system. The aim of this section
is to establish an equivalence of the two descriptions.
2.1
Derivation of Hamiltonian Equations
As we have discussed, Lagrangian formulation of classical mechanics is based
on Euler–Lagrange (Newton) equations of motion, which represent a system of
second-order differential equations, written for a set of variables that describe
the position of a physical system of interest. Hamiltonian formulation suggests
an equivalent description in terms of ﬁrst-order equations written for independent
variables describing the position and velocity of the system. The aim of this section
is to establish an equivalence of the two descriptions.
2.1.1
Preliminaries
Hamiltonian equations can be obtained from Lagrangian ones by successive applica-
tion of two well-known procedures in a theory of differential equations: reduction of
order and change of variables. Both procedures are intended to obtain an equivalent
system of equations from a given system. So, we recall here some elementary facts
from the theory of ordinary differential equations, which will be used below.

is equivalent to the ﬁrst-order system of 2n equations for 2n independent variables
qa./, b./
Pqa D va;
Fa.qa; vb; Pvc/ D 0;
(2.2)
in the following sense:
(a) If qa./ obeys Eq.(2.1), then the functions qa./; va./  Pqa./ obey Eq.(2.2);
(b) If the functions qa./; va./ obey Eq. (2.2), then qa./ obeys Eq. (2.1).
In other words, there is a one-to-one correspondence among solutions to the
systems. The system (2.2) is referred to as the ﬁrst-order form of the system (2.1).
Normal Form of a System We restrict ourselves to the ﬁrst-order system
Gi.z j; Pz k/ D 0:
(2.3)
It is said to be presented in the normal form if all the equations are solved
algebraically with respect to higher derivatives
Pzi D gi.z j/:
(2.4)
Any system with det @Gi
@Pzj
¤ 0 can (locally) be rewritten in the normal form.
According to the theory of differential equations, a normal system has well
established properties. In particular, under known restrictions to functions gi, the
theorem for the existence and uniqueness of a solution holds: let zi
0 be given
numbers, then locally there exists a unique solution z i./ of the system (2.4) that
obeys the initial conditions z i.0/ D zi
0. Physically it means the causal dynamics and,
in turn, a possibility of interpretation of the system (2.3) as the equations of motion
for some physical system of classical mechanics.
Change of Variables Let 'i.z j/ be given functions, with the property
det @'i
@z j ¤ 0:
(2.5)
Starting from the system (2.3) in original parametrization zi, functions 'i.z j/ can
be used to deﬁne another parametrization z0i, namely z0i D 'i.z j/. According to
the condition (2.5), change of variables z i ! z0i is invertible: the expressions
z0i D 'i.z j/ can be resolved with relation to z i, with the result being z i D  i.z0j/.
The change of variables induces the map on the set of functions (dynamical
variables): z i./ ! z0i./ D 'i.z j.//. Once the functions 'i.z j/ have been chosen,
we can use the new coordinates to analyze the system (2.3). Namely, we look for
solutions of the form z i D  i.z0j/. The system
Gi. j.z0k/; P j.z0k// D 0;
(2.6)

2.1
Derivation of Hamiltonian Equations
93
where P j.z0k/ D @ i
@z0k Pz0k, is equivalent to the initial system (2.3): if z i./ obeys the
system (2.3), then z0i./  'i.z j.// obeys (2.6), and vice versa.
Below we prefer to use the notation
Gi.z j; Pzj/
ˇˇ
zD .z0/ D 0;
(2.7)
instead of (2.6), since sometimes caution is needed in making use of the substitution,
see, for example, Eqs. (2.34) and (2.35) below. Besides, we will often use the same
letter z0i to denote the function  .z/ and the new coordinate, as long as this does not
lead to any misunderstanding.
More generally, we can look for solutions of the form
z i./ D  i.z0j./; /;
(2.8)
where 2n functions of 2n C 1 variables  i.z0j; / obey
det @ i
@z0j ¤ 0;
for any
:
(2.9)
So the relations (2.8) can be resolved with respect to z0
z0i D 'i.z j; /:
(2.10)
Substituting z in the form (2.8) into the Eq. (2.3), we obtain an equivalent problem
in terms of z0.
By construction, there are identities (for  and ' considered as functions of their
arguments)
'i. .z0; /; /  z0i;
 i.'.z; /; /  z i:
(2.11)

The ﬁrst identity relates Jacobi matrices of inverse and direct transformations: the
matrices turn out to be opposites. The second identity relates derivatives with respect
to  of the direct (') and the inverse ( ) transformations. The third identity differs

from the second one by changing ' $  , as should be the case (it is a matter of
convenience which transformation is called the “direct” and the “inverse” one).
Comment We stress that (2.8) represents a transformation on the space of
functions z./. Discarding the time-dependence, the expressions
z i D  i.z0j; /;
(2.13)
can be considered as one-parametric family of coordinate transformations in 2n -
dimensional space with coordinates z i. We could introduce the extended space with
coordinates .; z i/, then coordinate transformation of a general form in this space

Then .; z0i.// represents the curve in the transformed coordinates.

For any Lagrangian system there is an equivalent Hamiltonian system. We demon-
strate this mathematically notable fact for the particular case of a nonsingular

(2.20)
In this case, the system (2.19) can be rewritten in the ﬁrst-order normal form. Then
in specially chosen coordinates it acquires the Hamiltonian form. It basically gives
the Hamiltonian formulation of mechanics.
Computing the derivative with respect to  in Eq. (2.19), the latter can be
written as

(2.22)
Let us start with construction of the ﬁrst-order form for the system (2.21). We ﬁnd it
instructive to present here a less formal reasoning, as compared to that of Sect. 2.1.1.
We introduce 2n-dimensional conﬁguration-velocity space parameterized by inde-
pendent coordinates qa; vb (sometimes the coordinates vb are called generalized
velocities). Let us deﬁne evolution in this space according to the equations
MabRqb D Ka;
va D Pqa;
(2.23)
with M.q; Pq/, K.q; Pq/ given by Eq. (2.22). As before, time dependence of the
coordinates qa./ is determined by Lagrangian equations (2.21), while va./
accompanies Pqa./: va./ is determined from the known qa./, taking its derivative.
Evidently, systems (2.21) and (2.23) are equivalent. Further, we can use one of
the equations of the system in other equations, obtaining an equivalent system.
Substitution of the second equation from (2.23) into the ﬁrst one gives the desired

ﬁrst order system
Pqa D va;
NMab Pvb D NKa;
(2.24)
where NM; NK are obtained from (2.22) by the replacement Pq ! v, for example
NMab  Mab.q; Pq/jPqa!va D @L.q; v/
@va@vb :
(2.25)
According to Eq. (2.20), the matrix NM is invertible. Applying the inverse matrix QNM,
the Eqs. (2.24) can be presented in the normal form Pq D v, Pv D QNM NK. The right-hand
sides of these equations do not obey Eq. (2.18). So in terms of the variables q, v the
system is not a Hamiltonian one.
Making the variable change q ! q.q0; v0/, v ! v.q0; v0/ in Eq. (2.24), we could
look for the new variables that imply the Hamiltonian form of the system. The point
here is that there is a wide class of so-called canonical transformations that preserve
the Hamiltonian form of an arbitrary Hamiltonian system (see Sect. 2.7 below).
Hence the variables under discussion are not unique.1 The remarkable observation
made by W. R. Hamilton was that the change of variables (with v0 conventionally
denoted as p)

where

turns the system (2.24) into the Hamiltonian one. Due to Eq.(2.20) we have
det @pb.q;v/
@vc
¤ 0. The latter condition guarantees invertibility of the transforma-
tion (2.26). Let us denote the inverse transformation as

Let us conﬁrm that in terms of the variables q, p the system (2.24) acquires the
Hamiltonian form.
1If the change q.q0; v0/, v.q0; v0/ transforms the system (2.24) into the Hamiltonian one, and
q0.q00; v00/, v0.q00; v00/ is the canonical transformation, then the change q.q0.q00; v00/; v0.q00; v00//,
v.q0.q00; v00/; v0.q00; v00// transforms (2.24) into the Hamiltonian system as well.

desired L as a function of q, p: L.q; v.q; p// D pava  H.q; p/. According to
Sect. 2.1.2, phase space and conﬁguration-velocity space quantities are related by
the change of variables (2.26) and (2.27). Then L, as a function of q, v, is obtained

Here we introduce standard notation and conventions used to deal with Hamiltonian
equations. Let fA.q; p/; B.q; p/; : : :g be a set of phase-space functions.

Deﬁnition 1 The Poisson bracket is an application that with any two phase-space
functions A, B associates a third function denoted fA; Bg, according to the rule

The deﬁnition implies the following properties of the Poisson bracket:
(a) antisymmetry
fA; Bg D fB; AgI
(2.47)
(b) linearity with respect to both arguments, as a consequence of (2.47). Linearity
with respect to second argument is

(c) Leibnitz rule

(d) Jacobi identity

(2.50)
Exercise Verify (2.50) by direct computations. Hint: consider separately all
the terms involving, for example, two derivatives of B.
Poisson brackets among phase-space variables are called fundamental brackets.
They are:
fqa; pbg D ıab;
fqa; qbg D 0;
fpa; pbg D 0:
(2.51)
Poisson brackets can be used to rewrite Hamiltonian equations in the form:
Pqa D fqa; Hg;
Ppa D fpa; Hg:
(2.52)
Hence the Poisson bracket of q and p with the Hamiltonian determines their rate
of variation with time. Moreover, the same is true for any phase-space function: if
qa./; pb./ is a solution to the Hamiltonian equations, the rate of variation of the

2.2

function A.q./; p.// can be computed as:
PA.q; p/ D @A
@qa Pqa C @A
@pa
Ppa D @A
@qa fqa; Hg C @A
@pa
fpa; Hg
D fA; Hg:
(2.53)
Thus fA.q; p/; Hg D 0 implies that A is a conserved quantity, that is, it has a
ﬁxed value throughout any given solution. As an example, let us apply this result
to compute the rate of variation of a Hamiltonian. We have PH D fH; Hg D 0, due
to the antisymmetry of the Poisson bracket. Hence the Hamiltonian is the conserved
quantity, which gives a further argument in support of its interpretation as the total
energy.
Below it will be convenient to work with phase-space quantities by using the
following notation. For the phase-space coordinates we use the unique symbol:
.qa; pb/  z i; i D 1; 2; : : : ; 2n, or, equivalently, for a; b D 1; 2; : : : ; n we have
za D qa and znCb D pb. Thus Latin indices from the middle of the alphabet run from
1 to 2n. Let us also introduce the 2n  2n-dimensional symplectic matrix composed
of four n  n blocks

General Solution to Hamiltonian Equations
As a ﬁrst application of Hamiltonian formalism, we ﬁnd here a general solution to
Hamiltonian equations in terms of power series with respect to .

of these equalities. There is a generalization of the last equality for the case of a
function h.z0/

(2.59)
Exercise Verify the validity of Eq. (2.59) up to the third order of power
expansion.
Due to the identity (2.59), the series z.; z0/ D eh.z0/@ z0 turns out to be a formal
solution to the problem
Pz D h.z/;
z.0; z0/ D z0:

The problem with time-dependent Hamiltonian

.0/ D 0;
dyi
ds D fyi; H.z j.s/; .s//g;
yi.0/ D z i

Picture of Motion in Phase Space
Here we illustrate some advantages of Hamiltonian formalism as compared with the
Lagrangian one. In particular it will be seen that a general solution to Hamiltonian
equations has useful interpretations in the framework of hydrodynamics and
differential geometry.
General Solution as the Phase-Space Flux Hamiltonian equations (2.57) repre-
sent a normal system of 2n ﬁrst-order differential equations for 2n variables z i./.
According to the general theory of differential equations, the theorem of existence
and uniqueness of a solution holds for the case: for given numbers zi
0, locally there is
a unique solution z i./ of the system, which obeys the initial conditions: z i.0/ D zi
0.
Let us recall also the deﬁnition of a general solution: 2n functions of 2nC1 variables
z i.; cj/ are called a general solution of the system (2.57), if: (a) they obey the
system for all ci; (b) for given initial conditions zi
0, there are numbers Qcj such that
z i.0; Qcj/ D zi
0.
Owing to the above-mentioned theorem, a general solution to the normal system
contains all particular solutions (trajectories) of the system, any one of them
appearing after the appropriate choice of the constants ci.

Fig. 2.1 Trajectory ﬂows on conﬁguration and phase spaces
These results imply a remarkable picture of motion in phase space: trajectories
of the Hamiltonian system (2.57) do not intercept each other. To conﬁrm this, let us
suppose that two trajectories have interception at some point zi
0. These numbers
can be taken as initial conditions of the problem (2.57), and, according to the
theorem, there is only one trajectory which passes through zi
0, contrary to the initial
supposition. Thus, trajectories of a Hamiltonian system in phase space form a ﬂow,
similarly to the picture of the motion of a ﬂuid. Moreover, the “ﬂuid” turns out to be
incompressible, see Sect. 4.4.1. Note that it is very different from the corresponding
picture of motion in the conﬁguration space; see Fig. 2.1 on page 109.
Geometric Interpretation of the Symplectic Matrix In contrast to Lagrangian
equations, Hamiltonian ones have a simple interpretation in the framework of
differential geometry. Let us consider the right-hand sides of Hamiltonian equations
as components Hi of a vector ﬁeld in the phase space: Hi.z k/  !ij @H
@z j. Then the
Hamiltonian equations Pzi D Hi.z/ state that any solution to equations of motion
is a trajectory of this vector ﬁeld (according to differential geometry, a line is
the trajectory of a given vector ﬁeld, if vectors of the ﬁeld are tangent vectors to
the line at each point). Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld Hi also has certain interpretation.
Let H.z/ D const represent a surface of constant energy. Then the vector ﬁeld
Hi D
@H
@z i  .grad H/ijHDconst is normal to the surface at each point. The scalar
product of Hi with the vector grad H vanishes: Hi.grad H/i D @jH!ji@iH D 0, that
is, the Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld Hi is tangent to the surface. Hence each trajectory
z i./ lies on one of the surfaces of constant energy, as should be the case, see Fig. 2.2
on page 110. Now, observe the remarkable role played by the symplectic matrix !ij.
There is a whole hyperplane of the vectors, which are normal to grad H at a given
point. It is the matrix ! that transforms the normal vector grad H into the tangent
vector to a trajectory!

@iHi D 0. Now, let us consider the ﬁeld Hi.z k/ in the coordinates: zj  zl!lj.
Exercise Write H.z i/ D q  p2 in terms of the variables zi.

2.5
Conserved Quantities and the Poisson Bracket
Deﬁnition 2 A function Q.z i; / is called a conserved charge, if for any solution
z i./ of the Hamiltonian equations, Q retains a constant value:
Q.z./; / D c;
or
d
d Q D 0
on-shell:
(2.80)
Here “on-shell” stands for “for an arbitrary solution to equations of motion”, while
“off-shell” means “for an arbitrary function z i./”. Of course c may change when
we pass from one trajectory to another. In the current literature, a conserved charge
is also referred to as integral of motion, ﬁrst integral, constant of motion, conserved
quantity, conservation law or dynamical invariant—according to taste. Hereafter
we use the term (conserved) charge, as the shortest among these expressions.
There is an important necessary and sufﬁcient condition for a quantity Q to be a
conserved charge.

2.5

Assertion Q.z i; / represents a conserved charge if and only if
@Q
@ C fQ; Hg D 0
for all values of ; z i:
(2.81)
We stress that Q.z i; / should obey this equation as a function of its arguments. For
example, the function Q D x  pt
m obeys (2.81) with H D
p2
2m. In particular, the
quantity Q.z i/ (without manifest dependence on ) is conserved if and only if its
bracket with the Hamiltonian vanishes
fQ; Hg D 0:
(2.82)
Proof For any given function z./ we write identically
dQ
d D @Q
@ C fQ; Hg C @Q
@z i .Pzi  fz i; Hg/:
(2.83)
The condition (2.81) implies (2.80). Conversely, suppose that (2.80) is true. Given
a phase-space point zi
0 and a value 0, let z i./ represent the trajectory that passes
through zi
0 at the instant 0. Inserting the solution into the Eq. (2.82) and taking
 D 0 we obtain @0Q.0;z0/
@0
C fQ.0; z0/; H.z0; 0/g D 0 for any given 0, z0, as has
been stated.
An example of a charge is the Hamiltonian of a conservative system (see page
103). The search for the charges turns out to be an important task. From a pragmatic
point of view, knowledge of them allows us to simplify (sometimes to solve)
equations of motion of a system (it is sufﬁcient to recall that conservation of angular
momentum allows us to reduce the three-dimensional Kepler problem to a two-
dimensional one). Let us point out also that in quantum theory the concept of a
trajectory does not survive and is replaced by an abstract state space associated with
the system. But the notion of conserved charges survives, and they play a crucial
role in the interpretation of the state space, establishing a correspondence between
the states and physical particles.
A powerful method for obtaining charges for a system which exhibits certain
symmetries is provided by the Noether theorem, which is discussed in Chap. 7. Here
we describe some general properties of a set of charges.
If Q is a charge, an arbitrary function f.Q/ will also be a charge. If Q1; Q2
are charges, their product and linear combinations with numerical coefﬁcients also
represent charges. It is convenient to introduce the notion of independent charges
as follows: the charges Q˛.z i; /, ˛ D 1; 2; : : :, k  2n are called functionally
independent, if
rank@Q˛
@z i D k:
(2.84)

112
2
Hamiltonian Formalism
This implies that the expressions Q˛.z i; / D c˛ can be resolved with respect to k
variables z˛ among zi:
z˛ D G˛.za; c˛; /;
(2.85)
where za are the remaining variables of the set zi. As will be discussed in Sect. 7.9,
knowledge of k functionally independent charges immediately reduces the order of
equations of motion by k units: the initial system of 2n equations of second order
can be replaced by an equivalent system of 2n  k equations of second order plus k
equations of ﬁrst order.
It is a simple matter to conﬁrm the existence of 2n independent charges for a
given dynamical system. Let the functions f i.; cj/ represent a general solution to
the Hamiltonian equations. This implies, in particular, that det @f i
@cj ¤ 0. If we write
the equations z i D f i.; cj/, they can be resolved with respect to c: Qj.z i; / D cj,
giving 2n functions Qj.z i; /. By construction, substitution of any solution z i./ into
Qj turns them into constants. Thus Qj.z i; /, represent the conserved charges.
Of course, in practice the problem is the opposite: it is interesting to reveal
as many charges as possible by independent methods, and use them to search
for a general solution to equations of motion. In particular, inverting the previous
discussion, we conclude that the knowledge of 2n independent charges is equivalent
to knowledge of the general solution.
The set of charges is endowed with a remarkable algebraic structure in relation
to the Poisson bracket: the bracket of two charges is also a charge. This is proved by
direct computation

Here the Jacobi identity was used for the transition from the ﬁrst to the second line.
The last line is equal to zero since Q1, Q2 obey Eq. (2.81). Thus Q3  fQ1; Q2g is
conserved. Of course, it can be identically null or can be functionally dependent on
Q1, Q2. If not, the Poisson bracket can be used to generate new charges from the
known ones.
As an illustration, consider a free-moving particle, with the Hamiltonian H D

2m.pi/2, i D 1; 2; 3, and the corresponding Hamiltonian equations Pxi D 1
mpi, Ppi D 0.
Besides the Hamiltonian, the conserved charges are the momenta pi D ci D const
(as follows from their equations), and angular momentum Li D ijkxjpk D di D

them are functionally independent (imagine that all they are independent. Then it
would be possible to solve the equations Qi.z i/ D ci, obtaining a general solution
to the equations of motion in the form z i D f i.ci/, and arriving at the rather strange
result that the particle cannot move! Of course, their dependence can be veriﬁed by
direct computation of the corresponding Jacobian). By choosing pi and L2, L3 as
independent quantities, we ﬁnd the dynamics of pi, x2, x3 in terms of x1: pi D ci,
x2 D c2

Phase Space Transformations and Hamiltonian
Equations
In many interesting cases, the Lagrangian equations can be simpliﬁed with use of
the coordinate transformations q ! q0.q/ in the conﬁguration space. In particular,
if the system in question exhibits certain symmetries, they can be taken into account
to search for adapted coordinates. This often leads to separation of variables in
Lagrangian equations. Well-known examples are the use of polar coordinates in the
Kepler problem and the use of center-of-mass variables in the two-body problem.
The Hamiltonian formulation gives supplementary possibilities due to the fact that
a set of transformations in the phase space is much larger, allowing us to mix
position and velocity variables: q ! q0.q; p/, p ! p0.q; p/. In this section we
ﬁnd out how Hamiltonian equations transform under the substitution (2.8). Slightly
abusing terminology, the change of dynamical variables is called (time-dependent)
phase-space transformation. It will be seen that an arbitrary transformation spoils
the canonical form of the Hamiltonian equations. So it is reasonable to choose
the subset which preserves their form. Transformations of this subset are called
canonical transformations, they will be discussed in the next section.

Also, we sometimes omit the operation of substitution:

(2.96)
If the left and right hand sides of an expression have wrong “balance of variables”,
we need to substitute z.z0/ on the left or on the right hand side. In this notation we
can write, for example
z0i.z.z0; /; /  z0i

in the ﬁrst term on r.h.s. Equivalently, we can substitute z.z0; / in the last term on

2.7
Deﬁnition of Canonical Transformation
From comparison of Eqs. (2.88) and (2.93) we conclude that phase-space trans-
formation generally does not preserve the initial form of Hamiltonian equations.
It justiﬁes the following
Deﬁnition 3 The transformation z0i D 'i.z j; / is called canonical if for any
Hamiltonian system it preserves the canonical form of the Hamiltonian equations:
Pzi D !ij @H
@z j
z!z0
!
Pz0i D !ij @ QH.z0; /
@z0j
;
any H; some QH:
(2.101)
It will be seen below that
QH is related to H according to a simple rule (in
particular, for the case of time-independent canonical transformation, we have
QH.z0/ D cH.z.z0//; c D const/.
Transformations that do not alter a given Hamiltonian system are called canonoid
transformations.
By construction, the composition of canonical transformations is also a canonical
transformation : if z ! z0 D z0.z; /, and z0 ! z00 D z00.z0; / are canonical, then
z ! z00 D z00.z0.z; /; / is a canonical transformation. The set of canonical transfor-
mations form a group, with a product deﬁned by this law of composition. This allows
us to describe the ambiguity present in the Hamiltonization procedure: besides
Eq. (2.26), any change of the form .q; v/ ! .q0.q; p.q; v/; /; p0.q; p.q; v/; /,
where p.q; v/ D
@L
@v and q0.q; p; /, p0.q; p; / is a canonical transformation,
transforms Eq.(2.24) into the Hamiltonian system.
From Eqs. (2.100) and (2.101) it follows that the canonical transformation z0.z; /
obeys
fz0k; z0lgz
ˇˇ
z.z0;/ @0
lH.z.z0; // C @z0k.z; /
ˇˇ
z.z0;/
D !kl@0
l QH.z0; /;
any H; some QH:
(2.102)
From this expression we immediately obtain two useful consequences. First, taking
derivative @0
k of Eq. (2.102) we have
@0

fz0k; z0lgz
ˇˇ
z.z0;/

@0
lH.z.z0; // C @0
k.@z0k.z; /jz.z0;// D 0:
(2.103)
Since this is true for any H, the ﬁrst and second terms vanish separately. In particular,
the derivative of the Poisson bracket must be zero, hence fz0k; z0lgz
ˇˇ
z.z0;/ D ckl./,
where ckl does not depend on zi. So, the substitution of z.z0; / can be omitted, and
we have
fz0k; z0lgz D ckl./:
(2.104)

Second, denoting the left hand side of Eq. (2.102) by J0k, it can be written as J0k D

The Eqs. (2.104) and (2.107) hold for an arbitrary canonical transformation and will
be the starting point for our analysis below. In particular, it will be shown in Chap. 4,
that the system (2.107) is equivalent to a simple statement that the symplectic matrix
is invariant under the canonical transformation (disregarding the constant c):
@z0k
@z i !ij @z0l

(2.108)
Equivalently, we can speak on invariance of fundamental Poisson brackets
fz0k; z0lgz D cfz k; zlgz:
(2.109)
Transformations with c D 1 are called univalent canonical transformations.

with the numeric matrix !ij, see Eq. (2.54). According to Eq. (2.100), after the time-
independent transformation z i ! z0i D z0i.z j/, the equations read
Pz0i D Wij @ QH.z0/
@z0j
 fz0i; QH.z0/g.W/;
(2.111)

It can be shown that this obeys all the properties (2.47), (2.48), (2.49), and (2.50) of
the Poisson bracket. Equations of the form (2.111) with the non-canonical Poisson
bracket are known as generalized Hamiltonian equations.
For the latter use, we rewrite (2.111) in the parametrization

description of a system with velocity-dependent interactions. As an example,
consider the Lagrangian action of non-relativistic particle in an electromagnetic ﬁeld

Let us return to the Eqs. (2.114) and look for the function bb.q/ that preserves the

Due to the Hamiltonian nature of the Schrödinger equation, it is natural to search for

equation with respect to the time derivative7 for the real function '.t; xi/. According

So, the Schrödinger system cannot be obtained starting from a (nonsingular)
Lagrangian. Nevertheless, for the case of time-independent potential V.xi/, there
is a Lagrangian ﬁeld theory with the property that any solution to the Schrödinger

This can be treated as the classical theory of ﬁeld  on the given external background
V.xi/. The action contains Planck’s constant as a parameter. After the rescaling
.t; xi; / ! .„t; „xi;

the role of a coupling constant of the ﬁeld  with the background.
The formula (2.138) implies that after introduction of the ﬁeld  into the for-
malism, its mathematical structure becomes analogous to that of electrodynamics.
The dynamics of the magnetic EB and electric EE ﬁelds is governed by ﬁrst-order
Maxwell equations with respect to the time variable. Equivalently, we can use the
vector potential Aa, which obeys the second-order equations following from the
Lagrangian action discussed in Sect. 1.7.2. Aa represents the potential for magnetic
and electric ﬁelds, generating them according to EB D Œ Er; EA, EE D  1

to this, the ﬁeld  turns out to be a potential for the wave function, generating its
real and imaginary parts according to Eq. (2.138), see also Fig. 2.4 on the page 125.
In quantum mechanics the quantity ‰‰ has an interpretation as a probability
density, that is the expression ‰.t; xi/‰.t; xi/d3x represents the probability of

to (2.138). Finally, note that Eqs. (2.143) and (2.144) together with Eqs. (2.133)
and (2.134) imply that  obeys Eq. (2.139).
Let us ﬁnish this section with one more comment. As we have seen, treating a
Schrödinger system as a Hamiltonian one, it is impossible to construct the corre-
sponding Lagrangian formulation owing to the presence of the spatial derivatives
of momentum in the Hamiltonian. To avoid this problem, we can try to treat the
Schrödinger system as a generalized Hamiltonian system. We rewrite (2.133) in the
form
P' D f'; H0g0;
Pp D fp; H0g0;
(2.146)
where H0 is the “free ﬁeld” generalized Hamiltonian
H0 D

f'.t; x/; p.t; y/g0 D 

ı3.x  y/:
(2.148)
In contrast to H, the Hamiltonian H0 does not contain the spatial derivatives of
momentum.
A non-canonical bracket represents a typical property of singular Lagrangian
theories discussed in Chap. 8. There we obtain a more systematic treatment of the
observations made above: there is a singular Lagrangian theory subject to second
class constraints underlying both the Schrödinger equation and the classical ﬁeld
theory (2.140).

Probability as a Conserved Charge via the Noether
Theorem
In quantum mechanics the quantity ‰‰ has an interpretation of a probability
density, that is the expression ‰.t; xi/‰.t; xi/d3x represents the probability of
ﬁnding a particle in the volume d3x around the point xi at the instant t. Consistency
of the interpretation implies that, for the given solution ‰.t; xi/, the probability
of ﬁnding the particle anywhere in space, P.t/ D
R
R3 d3x‰‰ must be the same
number at any instant (the number can be further normalized to be 1), or dP
dt D 0 for
any solution. That is, P must be the conserved charge of the theory. In Chap. 7 we
will discuss the Noether theorem that gives a deep relationship among the symmetry
properties of an action and the existence of conserved charges for the corresponding
equations of motion. Here we obtain this relationship for a particular example
of the Schrödinger equation, showing that the preservation of probability can be
considered as a consequence of a symmetry presented in the functional (2.137).
Given the number , let us make the following substitution
‰ ! ei‰;
(2.149)
in the expression (2.137). Since this involves only products of a wave function with
its complex conjugate, ‰‰, the functional does not change
S0

According to Sect. 1.4.2, the functional is invariant under (2.149). The symmetry
transformation has a simple geometric interpretation as a rotation through the angle
 of a two-dimensional vector space spanned by .'; p/.
What are the consequences of the invariance? Take an expansion of ei‰ in the
power series at  D 0, keeping only a linear term, ei‰ D ‰ C ı‰, where ı‰ D

First-Order Action Functional, Routhian and All That
Here we describe a very elegant Hamiltonization recipe [10, 28] based on manipu-
lations with the Lagrangian action. Let
S D
Z
dL.qa; Pqa/;
(2.157)
be a Lagrangian action of a non-singular system. Let us introduce an extended phase
space parameterized by independent coordinates qa; pa; va. With the action (2.157),
we associate the following ﬁrst-order action on the extended space
S1 D
Z
d ŒL.qa; va/ C pa.Pqa  va/ :
(2.158)
This implies the equations of motion
Pqa D va;
Ppa D @L.q; v/
@qa
;
pa D @L.q; v/
@va
:
(2.159)
The last equation determines the conjugate momenta (see (2.26)), while the ﬁrst
two equations coincide with the ﬁrst-order equations of motion for the initial
action (2.157), see Eq.(2.31). So the action (2.158) represents an equivalent
formulation for the theory (2.157). In this formulation, equations for canonical
momenta (2.26) appear as part of the equations of motion. The remainder of the
Hamiltonization recipe consists of using the third equation to expel va from the
ﬁrst two equations. The corresponding computations coincide with those made in
Sect. 2.1.2, starting from Eq. (2.31), and give the Hamiltonian equations (2.39).
We ﬁnish this section with a comment on the formal relationship between the
different actions. Let us take the ﬁrst order action as a basic object. The Lagrangian
action can be obtained from S1 by using the ﬁrst equation from (2.159).
Solving the last equation from (2.159), v D v.q; p/, and substituting the result
into S1, we obtain the Hamiltonian action,
R

We can also substitute pa of the last equation from (2.159) into S1 obtaining the

Hamiltonian Formalism
For non-degenerate theory, (2.162) implies Pqb  vb D 0, then (2.163) is just the
Lagrangian equation of the theory. Hence the action Sv can also be used to analyze
the system.
Sometimes it is convenient to work with variational the problem consisting of
second-order action for one part of variables and second-order action for another
part. The combined action functional is called Routhian. Starting from a second-
order action, the is Routhian obtained by Hamiltonization of a part of variables. For
example, for the two-dimensional problem
S D
Z 1
2 Px2 C 1
2 Py2  U.x; y/;
(2.163)
let us introduce momentum for x only, p D @L

(2.164)
We look for an extremum of the functional with ﬁxed boundary conditions for
x, y and with an arbitrary p. This gives the Lagrangian equation for y and the
Hamiltonian equations for x and p.
2.10
Hamiltonization of a Theory with Higher-Order
Derivatives
Here we discuss a theory which involves the higher-order derivatives. Inclusion of
the higher derivatives into equations of motion is one of the ways to treat with the
problem of divergences in perturbative quantum gravity theory. If such terms are
added to the Einstein gravity, then the resulting quantum theory is renormalizable
[29]. Detailed discussion of the subject can be found in [30].

Using Eqs. (2.169) in (2.170) we reproduce the initial higher-order equa-

The functional (2.168) represents one more example of a singular action. So,
its Hamiltonian formulation is obtained according to the formalism that will be
discussed in Chap. 8. For the later use, we present the ﬁnal result for Hamiltonian

In this case the equations can be written in the normal form, with higher derivatives
separated on l.h.s. of the equations. Speciﬁcation of the position q1 as well as its
2N  1 derivatives at some instant implies unique solution to the Cauchy problem.
To present the system in the Hamiltonian form, we introduce 2N n dimensional
phase space spanned by the coordinates qi; pi, i D 1; 2; : : : ; N. Let us specify their
dynamics as follows. The variable q1 obeys the Eq.(2.176), while other variables

In conclusion, we point out that Eqs. (2.185), (2.186) can not be resolved with
respect to the momenta, that is the Ostrogradsky equations (2.190) can not be
obtained from a Lagrangian (without higher derivatives). To avoid the difﬁculty,
one needs to make an appropriate canonical transformation. For instance, for the
case of the Lagrangian L.q1; Pq1; Rq1/ it is sufﬁcient to make the transformation
q2 ! p2, p2 ! q2. After that, the Hamiltonian (2.189) and the Ostrogradsky
equations (2.190) turn out into Eqs. (2.173) and (2.172).

Canonical Transformations of Two-Dimensional
Phase Space
Abstract It is common in textbooks on classical mechanics to discuss canonical
transformations on the basis of the integral form of the canonicity conditions and
a theory of integral invariants [1, 12, 14]. We prefer to deduce all the properties
of canonical transformations by direct analysis of the canonicity conditions given
by Eqs. (2.104) and (2.107). For convenience, we have made the subject matter
of the next chapter independent from this one, so the reader can omit this and
continue from the next chapter. It is worth noting that time-independent canonical
transformations are an important tool to analyze the structure of a general singular
theory.

in turn implies fq0; p0g D c D const. The remaining Poisson brackets are fq0; q0g D

2. Let us deﬁne a Poisson bracket in relation to z0 variables as follows: fz0i; z0jgz0 D
!ij. For the case of univalent canonical transformation (c=1), Eq.(3.3) can be
written as
fz0i.z/; z0j.z/gz D fz0i; z0jgz0:

In accordance with this, for any two phase-space functions one obtains
fA.z/; B.z/gzjz.z0/ D fA.z.z0//; B.z.z0//gz0:
(3.9)
These expressions mean that univalent canonical transformation and computation of
the Poisson bracket are commuting operations. For this reason, Eqs. (3.8) and (3.9)
are sometimes referred to as a property of invariance of the Poisson bracket under
univalent canonical transformation.

Transformations with this property are called free canonical transformations. Using
the latter equation, one can represent the variables q0; p in terms of q; p0:

By construction, these expressions can in turn be solved with respect to q0; p0. So,
one can deal with a canonical transformation in the form (3.10), where q; p0 are
considered as independent variables, instead of its original form, with q; p being
independent. The identities (2.98) acquire the form

Eq. (3.13) with respect to q0 and p0 and adding the resulting expressions, one obtains
fq; pgz0 D c1.
Assertion Let zi ! z0i.z/ be a free canonical transformation, hence it can be
presented in the form (3.10). There is a function S.q; p0/ such that

The function S is called the generating function of the canonical transformation.
Proof The following function

(3.16)
obeys the desired conditions, as can be demonstrated by direct computations with
use of Eqs. (3.13) and (3.11). Notice that S is deﬁned on .q; p0/ space.
Thus we have seen that with a given canonical transformation one can associate
the corresponding generating function. It is natural to ask whether a given function
S.q; p0/ deﬁnes a canonical transformation. This seems to be true. In particular, the

Time-Dependent Canonical Transformations
Here we repeat the analysis of Sect. 3.1 for the case of time-dependent transforma-
tions in two-dimensional phase space. As compared with the previous case, the only
difference in the ﬁnal results is, in fact, a non-trivial form of a transformed Hamil-
tonian, see Eq.(3.29) below. Owing to this property, the time-dependent canonical
transformations can be used for the simpliﬁcation of Hamiltonian equations, see
below.

Canonical Transformations and Symplectic Matrix
For the case of time-dependent transformation q0 D q0.q; p; /; p0 D p0.q; p; /,
the Hamiltonian equations in terms of q0; p0 acquire the form (2.100)), while the
deﬁnition of canonical transformation (2.101) implies Eqs. (2.102), (2.103), (2.104),
(2.105), (2.106), and (2.107). As before, the set of canonical transformations can be
identiﬁed with the set of coordinate transformations leaving invariant (disregarding
a constant) the symplectic matrix !ij:
Assertion The transformation z0i D z0i.zb; / is canonical if and only if:

(B) Suppose that the transformation z0i D z0i.z; / obeys Eq. (3.20). First, note that
the Assertion on page 140 is true for the present case of time-dependent trans-
formations as well (since in the corresponding proof only partial derivatives
with respect to z0a were used). Equation (3.20) thus implies Eq. (3.13), and
differentiating the latter with respect to  we obtain:

where Eqs. (2.98) and (3.7) were used in the ﬁrst line, and Eq.(3.26) was used in
the transition from the ﬁrst to the second line. Thus condition (3.20) implies the
canonical form of the Hamilton equations

which completes the proof.
Besides, comparing this result with Eq.(2.101), one obtains a relationship
between the original and the transformed Hamiltonians:
Consequence Let za ! z0i D z0i.z; / be a canonical transformation. Then there is
a function F such that

z0i D Ci. Further, solving the algebraic equations z0i.z; / D Ci (where the functions
z0i.zj; / are known from the canonical transformation), one obtains a general
solution to the equations of motion in the initial parametrization: zi D zi.; Cj/.

Eq. (3.29) one needs two identities. First, from q.q0.q; p0; /p0; /  q it follows:

equalities as well as the manifest form of S, see Eq. (3.16).
As before, this result can be inverted in the following sense:

is the free canonical transformation.
The proof is the same as before (see page 140), since only partial derivatives with
respect to q0; p0 were used there.

Chapter 4
Properties of Canonical Transformations
Abstract As we have seen in Sect. 2.7, the canonical form of Hamiltonian
equations is not preserved by general phase-space transformations. Those that
leave the form of the equations unaltered were called canonical transformations. In
this chapter, we discuss their properties for the case of phase space of an arbitrary
dimension.
We start from the demonstration that the equation fz0i; z0jgz D fzi; zjgz, which
represents the invariance of the Poisson bracket under a transformation z ! z0.z; /,
can be rewritten in the following equivalent form: @0iEj.z0/  @0jEi.z0/ D 0. This
means that Ei are components of a conservative vector ﬁeld, and therefore there
is a potential E, such that Ei D @0iE. Thus, the invariance of the Poisson bracket
is equivalent to the statement, that the transition functions z0i.z; / can be used
to construct a conservative ﬁeld. In turn, this allows us to prove the following
two facts. First, canonical transformations are the only ones that leave the Poisson
bracket invariant (up to a constant). This gives a simple rule for checking whether a
given transformation is a canonical one. Second, with any canonical transformation1
can be associated a generating function. Its partial derivatives give the transition
functions of the transformation. The generating function can be obtained from the
above-mentioned potential according to a simple rule. Among other things, it gives
a simple way to construct examples of canonical transformations.
Further, it will be seen that the Hamiltonian has a rather non-trivial transforma-
tion law under time-dependent canonical transformation (it does not transform as
a scalar function). This implies the possibility of looking for the transformation
which trivializes the Hamiltonian function (and thus trivializes the equations of
motion) in the new coordinate system. By this means, the problem of ﬁnding a
general solution to Hamiltonian equations can be replaced by the problem of ﬁnding
a generating function of the transformation. The generating function obeys the
so-called Hamilton–Jacobi equation, which can be solved in many interesting cases.
1Below, we discuss only a free canonical transformation. For an arbitrary canonical transformation,
the situation is similar, see [14].

From this equation we expect that form-invariance may be closely related with the
symmetry properties of the symplectic matrix. In fact, at least for time-independent
transformations, invariance of !: @iz0k!ij@jz0l D !kl implies form-invariance of
Hamiltonian equations. We can also speak of an invariance of the Poisson bracket,
since the above equation can also be written as fz0k; z0lgz D fzk; zlgz; see (2.100).
In this section we establish an exact relationship: the set of transformations, which
preserves the canonical form of Hamiltonian equations, coincides with a set which
leaves the Poisson bracket invariant (up to a constant).

Similarly, Eq. (4.5) implies Wjl D 2@0jGl for any ﬁxed l. Since W is antisymmetric,
this equation implies the following restriction on Gl: @0jGl D @0lG j for any j, l.
It allows us to rewrite the expression for W in an explicitly antisymmetric form:
Wjl D @0jGl  @0lG j. The last two equations can be used to show that W does not
depend on z0i. Indeed, substitution of the last equation back into (4.5) gives the
expression @0i@0lG j C @0j@0lGi D @0lWji D 0, for any i, j, l. Hence W does not
depend on z0 and can be a function only of  W Wij D Wij./.

which completes the proof.
From Eqs. (4.17) and (4.18) it follows that one can add to E an arbitrary function
e./. Note that this does not contribute to the Eq.(4.21).
The result obtained means that the invariance (4.2) of the Poisson bracket can be
taken as a deﬁnition for the canonical transformation.
Comparing our result (4.22) with Eq.(2.101), we have an exact relationship

Inﬁnitesimal Canonical Transformations: Hamiltonian as
a Generator of Evolution
Intuitively, inﬁnitesimal canonical transformation is not very different from the
identity transformation: Qzi D zi C ızi, ızi  1. Its remarkable property is that it
is generated by some function through the Poisson bracket: ızi D fzi; ˆg. As will
be seen below, ﬁnite canonical transformations have a similar (but not identical)
structure.
Deﬁnition 1 Consider a family of transformations that are linear on the parameter 
Qzi.zj; / D zi C Gi.z/:
(4.29)
They are called inﬁnitesimal canonical transformations, if they obey the canonicity
condition (4.2) in linear order on , that is
fQzi; Qzjg D !ij C O.2/;

or, in other words:

Properties of Canonical Transformations
Write the Taylor expansion about  D 0. Ignoring all the higher order terms
we have:
z0i.zj; /  Qzi D zi C Gi.z/;
(4.33)
where Gi D @z0i.z; /
ˇˇ
D0. This turns out to be an inﬁnitesimal canonical
transformation. For a small value of the parameter,   1, the second term
gives a leading contribution to the complete transformation z0i.
4.2.1
Generator of Inﬁnitesimal Canonical Transformation
Assertion Qzi D zi C Gi.z/ represents an inﬁnitesimal canonical transformation if
and only if there is a function ˆ.z/ such that
Gi D fzi; ˆg D !ij@jˆ:
(4.34)
Accordingly, any inﬁnitesimal canonical transformation has the form
Qzi D zi C fzi; ˆg:
(4.35)
Hence, properties of the inﬁnitesimal canonical transformation are determined by a
unique function ˆ.z/. It is called a generator of inﬁnitesimal transformation.
Proof Supposing that (4.29) represents an inﬁnitesimal canonical transformation,
then Eq. (4.31) is satisﬁed. Contracting it with !mi!jn we obtain the equation
@n.!mkGk/  @m.!nkGk/ D 0. This states that !mkGk are components of the curl-
free vector ﬁeld. Therefore there is a potential, !mkGk D @mˆ, which proves the
statement (4.34).
Conversely, consider a transformation of the form:
zi ! Qzi D zi C fzi; ˆg;
(4.36)
determined by the function ˆ. Using the Jacobi identity we obtain:
fQzi; Qzjg D !ij C .fzi; fzj; ˆgg C ffzi; ˆg; zj; g/ C O.2/
D !ij C .ffzi; zjg; ˆg C O.2/ D !ij C O.2/:
(4.37)
Coordinate transformations z ! z0 can be used to deﬁne a map on the space of
phase functions A.z/. By deﬁnition, the function A is mapped into A0 according to

the rule:
z ! z0
)
A ! A0;
where
A0.z0/ D A.z/:
(4.38)
That is, a value of the transformed function A0 at z0 coincides with the value of A at
the point z. The difference
ıf A.z/  A0.z/  A.z/;
(4.39)
is called the variation in form of the function. For the case of an inﬁnitesimal
canonical transformation, the variation in form is governed by a generator:
ıfA.z/ D fˆ; Ag C O.2/:
(4.40)
To conﬁrm this, let us substitute Eq. (4.43) into the deﬁnition (4.38): A0.z C
fzi; ˆg C O.2// D A.z/, or
A0.z/ C @iA0.z/fzi; ˆg C O.2/ D A.z/;
(4.41)
which implies
ıf A.z/ D fˆ; A0.z/g C O.2/ D
fˆ; A.z/  O./g C O.2/ D fˆ; Ag C O.2/:
(4.42)
In the passage from the ﬁrst to the second line we have used Eq. (4.41) once again.
From Inﬁnitesimal to Finite Canonical Transformations It is worth noting that
an inﬁnitesimal canonical transformation is generally not a canonical transforma-
tion. But it can be used to construct a canonical transformation in terms of a power
series of .
Assertion Given an inﬁnitesimal canonical transformation Qzi D zi C Gi D zi C
fzi; ˆ.z/g, the formula:
z0i D efzk;ˆ.z/g @
@zk zi;
(4.43)
represents a canonical transformation.
Proof We need to conﬁrm that z0i obeys Eq.(4.2). Remember that z0i obeys the
equation (see Sect. 2.3):
@z0i
@ D Gi.z0k/:
(4.44)

Properties of Canonical Transformations
As a consequence, the function Wij./  fz0i; z0jg obeys the problem:
@Wij
@ D fWij; ˆg;

Note that the symplectic matrix !ij solves the problem. Since the problem has a
unique solution, we conclude that Wij D !ij, that is, fz0i; z0jg D !ij.
Evolution of a System as a Canonical Transformation: Hamiltonian as a

equations of a system with the Hamiltonian H.z/ has the form

(4.46)
This formula can be considered as a family of coordinate transformations param-
eterized by  that relates the initial z0 and the ﬁnal z positions of the system.
Comparing (4.46) with (4.43), we conclude that the general solution represents an
example of canonical transformation with the generator being the Hamiltonian of a
system. For a small value of , an approximate solution is given by the linear term
of the power expansion
zi.z0; /  zi
0 C fzi
0; H.z0/g;
(4.47)
and turns out to be an inﬁnitesimal canonical transformation. We conclude that
the evolution of a dynamical system is a canonical transformation. Moreover, the
Hamiltonian turns out to be the generator of the transformation.
4.3
Generating Function of Canonical Transformation
In this section we discuss a fairly large class of transformations called free
canonical transformations. They have the remarkable property of being generated
by phase-space functions (transition functions of the free transformation appear as
partial derivatives of the generating function, see Eq. (4.57) below). Intuitively, this
property can be expected from the observation that any canonical transformation is
related to a conservative vector ﬁeld, see Eqs. (4.17), (4.18) and (4.19). The potential
of the ﬁeld represents, in fact, the generating function.

4.3

4.3.1
Free Canonical Transformation and Its Function
F.q0; p0; /
Given the canonical transformation qa ! q0a D q0a.q; p; /, pa ! p0
a D p0
a.q; p; /
suppose that equations for q0 can be resolved with respect to p: q0a D q0a.q; p; / )
pa D pa.q; q0; /. Transformations with this property are called free canonical
transformations. Using this last equation, we can represent the variables p, p0 in
terms of q, q0:
pa D pa.q; q0; /;
p0
a D p0
a.q; q0; /  p0
a.q; p.q; q0; /; /:
(4.48)
By construction, these expressions can in turn be resolved with respect to q0, p0. So,
we can work with the canonical transformation in the form (4.48), where q, q0 are
considered as independent variables, instead of its original form, with q, p being
independent.
For later use we now rewrite the potential E.z0; /, deﬁned by Eq. (4.14), in an
equivalent, but less symmetric form. Namely, let us write parts of the system (4.14)
for q0 and p0 separately
 cqb @pb

2qb.z0; /pb.z0; /  1

(4.51)
Hence the Lemma on page 150 can be formulated in terms of F: the invariance of
the symplectic form (4.13) under a transformation is equivalent to the existence of
the potential F, which obeys Eq. (4.51).
As we have seen in the previous section, a general solution to the Hamiltonian
equations can be identiﬁed with a canonical transformation relating the initial and
ﬁnal positions of a system. The generating function F of the transformation turns
out to be the Hamiltonian action; see Sect. 4.8.

Canonical Transformations in Perturbation Theory
Now, let us consider a dynamical system with the Hamiltonian being the sum of two
terms
dzi
d D !ij @.H0.z/ C H1.z//
@zj
:
(4.72)
It is said that the initial system with H0 is “perturbed” by H1. Suppose that a general
solution to the unperturbed system H0 is known. Then the associated canonical
transformation (4.78) turns the system (4.72) into a Hamiltonian system with the
Hamiltonian H1:
dz0i
d D !ij @H1.z.z0; //
@z0j
:
(4.73)
Actually, since the transformation is canonical, the new Hamiltonian is (see
Eq. (4.59)) H0 C H1 C @S, but @S D H0 due to Eq. (4.71).
Exercise Work out this result by direct computations with use of
Eqs. (2.100), (2.98), (4.68).
If z0i.cj; / represents the general solution to the problem (4.73), we obtain a
general solution to the problem (4.72) by taking a composition with the unperturbed
solution (4.78), zi D zi.z0j.ck; /; /.
We have shown, through the use of canonical transformations, how the perturbed
problem (4.72) can be treated in the framework of the unperturbed one (4.66).
According to the ﬁnal result, zi D zi.z0j.ck; /; /, perturbation in the energy
of a system can be reformulated as perturbation of the initial conditions for the
unperturbed problem. This observation turns out to be useful in quantum mechanics
and in quantum ﬁeld theory, where we can equally use either the Schrodinger, or
the Heisenberg or the interaction pictures [33] to study an evolution of the quantum
system.

tonian H0 C H1 D 1

4.4.3
Coordinates Adjusted to a Surface
Consider the algebraic equation F.qa; pb/ D 0. Suppose that it can be resolved with
respect to one of the variables, say p1: p1 D f.qa; p2; p3; : : : ; pn/. We show here
that there is a canonical transformation such that in the new coordinates the surface
F D 0 is described by the equation p0
1 D 0, where p0
1 D p1  f, see Fig. 4.3.
This result appears to be interesting in the context of singular theories. In that
case the system of Hamiltonian equations necessarily contains both differential
equations (in the canonical form) and algebraic equations F˛ D 0 called Dirac
constraints. So, all solutions to the equations of motion lie on a surface deﬁned
by these algebraic equations. Then it is natural to choose special coordinates
such that the surface looks like a hyperplane in these coordinates: z0
˛ D 0. We
demonstrate that the corresponding transformation can be chosen to be canonical,
that is, the canonical form of the Hamiltonian equations will not be spoiled in the
new coordinates. This greatly simpliﬁes analysis of the Hamiltonian equations and
physical interpretation of a general singular theory [10].
It will be convenient to use the following notation: zi D .q1; p1; z˛/, that is z˛ are
all canonical pairs except .q1; p1/. Let us look for the new coordinates in the form
q01 D q1;
p0
1 D p1  f.q1; z˛/;
z0˛ D z˛ C h˛.q1; z˛/;
(4.74)
with undetermined functions h˛. We impose for them the following conditions:
h˛.0; z˛/ D 0:
(4.75)
The functions h˛ can be chosen in such a way that the canonicity conditions

@z . The Cauchy
problem (4.75) for it has a unique solution h˛.q1; z˛/; see, for example [4].
The solution automatically obeys Eq. (4.78). To conﬁrm this, we write an
equation for the function fz0˛; z0ˇg by differentiating the commutator with respect
to q1. Using Eq. (4.77) and the Jacobi identity, we obtain
@
@q1 fz0˛; z0ˇg D ffz0˛; z0ˇg; fg

while Eq. (4.75) implies the boundary condition:

(4.80)
Note that the matrix !˛ˇ obeys Eqs. (4.79) and (4.80). Since, as before, the problem
has a unique solution, one concludes that (4.78) holds.
The adjusted coordinates can be equally constructed for a system of equations
F.qa; pb/ D 0. This is achieved by multiple repetition of the above procedure.
After completing the ﬁrst step described above, we substitute the coordinates (4.74)
into the remaining equations, repeat the procedure for one of them, and so on.

The relationship among the integrands is a consequence of the previously obtained
properties of canonical transformations. Assuming that the Eq. (4.83) holds for a
canonical transformation, we easily ﬁnd most of their properties, see [1, 12, 13].
Exercise Does the Hamiltonian equations (4.22) follow from the principle
of least action applied to Hamiltonian action with the integrand (4.82)?
Consider also the cases of univalent and univalent time-independent canonical
transformations.

Summary: Equivalent Deﬁnitions for Canonical
Transformation
In Sect. 2.7 canonical transformations were deﬁned as those preserving the standard
form of Hamiltonian equations. In subsequent sections we have found a number of
equivalent deﬁnitions. For convenience, we present here the resulting list:
Let zi ! z0i.zj; / be a phase-space transformation. Then the following state-
ments are equivalent and any one of them can be taken as a deﬁnition for the
canonical transformation:
1. The transformation preserves the canonical form of Hamiltonian equations for

Hamilton–Jacobi Equation
According to Eq. (4.52), the Hamiltonian has a nontrivial transformation law under
the time-dependent canonical transformation. The transformed Hamiltonian QH
depends on the function F.z0; /, which determines the transformation according
to Eqs. (4.87) and (4.89). We can look for the F that makes QH as simple as possible,
which implies an interesting method to look for a general solution to Hamiltonian
equations

Suppose we have found the transformation (4.92) which annihilates QH:
@F.z0; /
@
 .pa@qa  H.z//jz.z0;/ D 0;
(4.94)
then (4.93) acquires the form Pz0i D 0, and can be immediately solved: z0i D ci D
const. In the new coordinates the system is at rest. Now let us return to the initial
variables: one substitutes this result into l.h.s. of Eq. (4.92) and solves them in
relation to z:
zi D zi.; cj/:
(4.95)
By construction, this gives the general solution to equations of motion (4.91).
The geometric interpretation of this procedure is very simple: we search for a
special coordinate system .z0i; / of the extended phase space, such that trajectories
of the dynamical system look like vertical straight lines at these coordinates, see
Fig. 4.4 on page 169.
According to this scheme, the problem (4.91) is replaced by the problem (4.94),
which contains 2n C 1 unknown functions zi.z0j; /, F.z0i; /. By construction they
obey 2n Eqs. (4.87). Supposing that the transformation under investigation is free,
the system (4.94) and (4.87) can be equally analyzed in terms of independent
variables q, q0 instead of q0, p0. According to Eqs. (4.59) and (4.58), in the variables
q, q0 the system acquires the form3

3Since the general solution (4.95) determines the canonical transformation (4.92), the Eq. (4.97)
state that we search for the generating function of the evolution.

Remind that solutions to partial differential equations generally depend on arbitrary
functions. In particular, we can look for the so called complete solution that depends
on n arbitrary numbers q0b. Let S.qa; q0b; /, with det
@S
@qa@q0b
¤ 0 be such a
solution. Then Eq. (4.97) determines the free canonical transformation (4.92) which
annihilates the Hamiltonian QH. According to the previous analysis, solving the
algebraic Eqs. (4.97) for zi D qa; pb, we obtain the general solution zi D zi.z0j; /, to
the Hamiltonian equations (4.91).
In short, the Hamilton–Jacobi method for solving Hamiltonian equations (4.91)
can be formulated as follows:
1. Find the solution S.qa; q0b; /, det
@2S

and resolve them in relation to q, p:

pa D pa.q0; p0; /:
(4.101)
These functions represent the general solution to the Eq. (4.91), with 2n integra-
tion constants q0a; p0

Summing up, the problem to ﬁnd a general solution to 2n ordinary differential
equations (4.91) can be replaced by the problem to ﬁnd the solution S of partial
differential equation (4.99) which depends on n arbitrary constants.

Action Functional as a Generating Function of Evolution
In the Sect. 4.4.1 we have seen that a general solution to Hamiltonian equations can
be identiﬁed with a canonical transformation. It was demonstrated in Sect. 4.2 that
the Hamiltonian represents the generator of the corresponding inﬁnitesimal trans-
formation. Here we construct the generating function of the ﬁnite transformation.
When the general solution to the Hamiltonian equations is known, it is possible
to construct the complete solution S of the Hamilton–Jacobi equation in closed
form in terms of the Hamiltonian action SH, see Eq.(4.113) below. According to
the previous section, this S represents the generating function of the evolution.
Let
z D z.z0; /;
z.z0; 0/ D z0;
(4.109)
be a general solution to the Hamiltonian equations as a function of initial values z0
(see discussion at the end of Sect. 4.2). Let us substitute (4.109) into Eq. (4.94)

omit it in the following:
F.q0; p0; 0/ D 0:

generating function, we obtain:

Being a complete solution to the Hamilton–Jacobi equation, S represents the gen-
erating function of the canonical transformation z0 ! z associated with the general
solution. The expression on the r.h.s. is the Hamiltonian action represented as a
function of initial and ﬁnal position. Hence it can be said that the Hamiltonian action
is the generating function of canonical transformation along true trajectories: it
transforms the system coordinates from one time to another.
According to the previous section, knowledge of the complete integral of
the Hamilton–Jacobi equation allows us to construct the general solution to the
Hamiltonian equations of motion. Here this result has been inverted. Hence, we have
the mathematically notable fact that searching for a complete solution to the partial

Chapter 5
Integral Invariants
Abstract This chapter is devoted to the discussion of the theory of integral invari-
ants, which reveals an interesting structure of the general solution to Hamiltonian
equations. We discuss the basic Ponicaré-Cartan and Ponicaré integral invariants
that represent line integrals of a special vector ﬁeld deﬁned on extended phase
space. The integrals retain the same value for any closed contour taken on a given
two-dimensional surface formed by solutions to the Hamiltonian equations. As will
be discussed in Sect. 5.1.3, this property could be taken as a basic principle of
mechanics, instead of the principle of least action. Besides their applications in
mechanics, integral invariants are widely used in the theory of differential equations.

Summing up, we have seen that a line integral of the vector ﬁeld (5.11), being
computed along the proper classes of curves, reduces either to the Hamiltonian
action, or to the Poincaré-Cartan integral, or to the Poincaré universal integral.
By construction, the Poincaré-Cartan integral could depend on a choice of the
contour C: I D IC. Remarkably enough, it happens to be contour-independent: I
does not change its value in the case of an arbitrary displacement (with deformation)
of the contour along the tube. This is one of the results discussed in the next section.

Here we demonstrate that I has the same value for any contour taken on a given tube
of trajectories of the Hamiltonian system. Conversely, the contour-independenceof I
(constructed with the help of a function H) on a tube of solutions to the system (5.3)
implies that the system is the Hamiltonian one. More exactly, we have

The afﬁrmation demonstrated means, in particular, that for a given Poincaré–
Cartan integral there is a unique system of differential equations that admits this
integral as the integral invariant. This statement could be taken as the basic principle
of mechanics, instead of the principle of least action.

does not depend on the choice of the simultaneous closed contour C on the tube.
Since H is not presented in the expression for I1, it is an invariant of any
Hamiltonian system. This explains the terminology “universal”.
It should be stressed that I1 is invariant under the replacement C ! C0, where
both contours are simultaneous. So, C0 can be considered as the result of the
evolution of the points of C for the same time interval. Recall that the evolution is
an example of a canonical transformation. This explains why the Poincaré integral
invariant can be used to study properties of canonical transformations; see, for
example [14]. Note also, that according to Eq.(5.33), the invariance of I1 implies
I1.0/ D I1.0/. That is, I1 does not depend on time.
The Poincaré integral invariant has an interesting geometric interpretation. To
discuss this interpretation, let us recall that the following line integral
A D
I

(5.37)
on the two-dimensional plane parameterized by q and p, gives an area of the region
limited by the closed contour D. In the extended phase space, let us consider
the contour C1: q1 D q1.0; ˛/, p1 D p1.0; ˛/, z˛ D 0,  D 0. This is the
projection of the integration contour C: zi D zi.0; ˛/,  D 0 of the Poincaré
integral invariant (5.32) on the .q1; p1/-plane (see Fig. 5.5 on page 184). According
to Eq. (5.37), the area inside C1 can be computed as

While the contours C, Ca and their areas can vary during an evolution, the sum (5.39)

Let us enquire about the structure of the universal invariant of the general
form (5.10). In other words, we are interested in ﬁnding the most general form of
the vector ﬁeld that implies the invariance of the integral.

Some Mechanical Problems in a Geometric
Setting
Abstract The Maupertuis variational principle is the oldest least-action principle
of classical mechanics. Its precise formulation was given by Euler and Lagrange;
for its history, see Yourgrau and Mandelstam (Variational Principles in Dynamics
and Quantum Theory. Pitman/W.B. Sanders, London/Philadelphia,1968). However,
the traditional formulation (as a variational problem subject to the constraint that
only the motions with ﬁxed total energy are considered), remained problematic, as
emphasized by V. Arnold (double citation): “In his Lectures on Dynamics (1842–
1843), C. Jacobi commented: “In almost all textbooks, even the best, this Principle
is presented in such a way that it is impossible to understand”. I do not choose to
break with tradition” (Arnold, Mathematical Methods of Classical Mechanics, 2nd
edn. Springer, New York, 1989).

Analysis of Trajectories and the Principle of Maupertuis
The Maupertuis variational principle is the oldest least-action principle of classical
mechanics. Its precise formulation was given by Euler and Lagrange; for its history,
see [34]. However, the traditional formulation (as a variational problem subject to
the constraint that only the motions with ﬁxed total energy are considered), remained
problematic, as emphasized by V. Arnold (double citation): “In his Lectures on
Dynamics (1842–1843), C. Jacobi commented: “In almost all textbooks, even the
best, this Principle is presented in such a way that it is impossible to understand”. I
do not choose to break with tradition” [2].
In this section we present the principle of Maupertuis as an unconstrained
variational problem. We discuss a conservative Lagrangian system. Its evolution can
be obtained according to the least action principle. In a full analogy, the principle of
Maupertuis can be formulated as the least action principle leading to the equations
for trajectories, without mentioning the time evolution along them.
In greater detail, the strategy of this section is as follows.
Given the solution qa D qa./ of the Lagrangian equations, we can exclude
the time , thus obtaining the functions q˛.q1/ describing a trajectory of motion.
We are interested in an analysis of the trajectories. It is possible to write a system
of differential equations describing the trajectories. The system shows a number
of very interesting properties, that form in fact the contents of the principle of
Maupertuis. On the phase space, equations for the trajectories form a Hamiltonian

system (with q1 playing the role of an “evolution parameter”). So, we are able to ﬁnd
the corresponding Hamiltonian action. Equations for trajectories can be obtained
as stationarity conditions of the Hamiltonian action. This variational problem for
trajectories is precisely the principle of Maupertuis. Further, from the Hamiltonian
formulation we can restore a Lagrangian one, thus obtaining the Lagrangian version
of the principle of Maupertuis. The Hamiltonian and Lagrangian for the trajectories
q˛.q1/ will be found below in terms of the initial Hamiltonian and Lagrangian for
qa./.
This formalism will be further applied to describe a conservative mechanical
system in geometric terms.

interval Œ1; 2 in the conﬁguration space) is called a trajectory. At least locally, it
can be described without mentioning the evolution parameter. Suppose that one of
the functions describing the solution, say q1 D q1./, can be resolved with respect
to  W  D .q1/. The substitution of this function into the remaining ones gives

Starting from the system (6.1), it is possible to write closed equations determining

Here QH is constructed according to Eqs. (6.15) and (6.16). The problem is known
as the principle of Maupertuis (the notation padqa is due to (6.16)). This states that
among all the phase-space trajectories with a given energy H.qa; pa/ D h, a system
follows the trajectory that supplies an extremum to the functional (6.23). Notice that
the construction of QH, which enters into Eq. (6.23), implies knowledge of the initial
system Hamiltonian.
Due to the Hamiltonian character of equations for trajectory, in any particular
example one can restore the corresponding Lagrangian QL.q˛; q;˛; q1; h/ / by apply-
ing the procedure described in Sect. 2.1.4. We now discuss how this L can be

To sum up, we have discussed trajectories of the conservative Lagrangian system.
Equations for the trajectories (6.7) also form the Lagrangian system, so they can
be obtained from a variational problem with an appropriately chosen Lagrangian,
which has been constructed in a closed form in terms of the initial Lagrangian, see
Eq. (6.27).
The principle of Maupertuis represents the Hamiltonian version of this vari-
ational problem: phase-space equations for trajectories form the Hamiltonian
system (6.20), and hence can be obtained as stationarity conditions of the Hamil-
tonian action functional (6.23).

6.2
Description of a Potential Motion in Terms of a Pair
of Riemann Spaces
The trajectory of a free moving particle is a straight line. From the geometric point
of view, straight lines in Euclidean space represent a very special class, being the
shortest lines between two points. So, one can say in a geometric interpretation of
free motion, that among all the trajectories, the particle chooses the shortest one.
Generally, the trajectory is not a straight line for a potential system. Nevertheless,
there is an interesting possibility of a similar geometric treatment for that case.
In differential geometry there is a class of so called Riemann spaces with
the metrical and parallel transport properties generally different from those of
the Euclidean space. Instead of the standard expression for inﬁnitesimal distance:
ds D
p
ıabdqadqb, in the Riemann space we have the expression ds D
p
gabdqadqb.
The metrical properties are determined by the set of functions gab.qa/ known as
the metric of the space. Since the metric depends on qa, the metrical properties
change from one point to another as well as differing in various directions from a
given point. The analogy of a straight line (that is, the analogy of free motion) in
the Riemann space is a geodesic line representing the curve of a minimal length
between two points.2 Parallel transport is deﬁned by an independent quantity called
the afﬁne connection.
From the previous section we know that the description of a trajectory of motion
can be separated from the description of the dynamics along it; see Eqs. (6.12)
and (6.13) for the case of potential motion. Here we show that the conﬁguration
space of the system can be equipped with a metric (constructed with the help of
the potential) in such a way that trajectories turn out to be the shortest lines of
this metric. On the kinematic level, potential motion in ﬂat Euclidean space is
thus equivalent to free motion in curved Riemann space. Intuitively, presence of a
potential can be treated as leading to the deformation of the metrical properties of the
initially ﬂat conﬁguration space. This in turn causes deviation of the trajectory from
the straight line, keeping it the shortest line with respect to the metric. Moreover,
the dynamics (time of evolution) also has an invariant geometric meaning. Potential
motion in this framework looks like an inertial motion, in a full (but formal) analogy
with the inertial motion in the presence of gravity in Einstein’s general theory of
relativity.
Here we give only an elementary discussion of the problem. The subsequent
sections are devoted to a more detailed discussion. For our present purposes it is
sufﬁcient to bear in mind that the shortest line in Riemann space can be described
in the parametric form, qa./, by so-called geodesic equations in canonical
parametrization (for an elementary demonstration of this fact see a sequence of
2More exactly, the notions of a geodesic and a minimal length line coincide only in the Riemann
space with a Riemann connection. Here we do not distinguish these notions. They are discussed in
more detail in the following sections.

Then the geodesic Eq. (6.42) coincide with Eq. (6.44) for the potential motion with
total energy h. That is, the trajectory of potential motion represents the shortest line
of this metric. Complete equations are not equivalent, as is clear from comparison
of Eqs. (6.41) and (6.43). So, an interesting task would be to ﬁnd the equations of
geometric origin equivalent to the complete problem (6.11). This will be done in
Sect. 6.8. Here we only point out that the dynamics (6.43) also has an invariant
geometric meaning. Let us write the solution q˛.q1/ in the parametric form q1 D ,

with the Eq. (6.43), one concludes that the propagation time can be identiﬁed with
the length of the trajectory in space with the metric (6.46).
In this way, one can speak of a formal geometrization of mechanics: with a
system of total energy h propagating in a given potential U.qa/, we associate a
pair of Riemann spaces. The inﬂuence of the potential on the motion is encoded
in the metrical properties of these spaces. The trajectory of the potential motion in
the Euclidean conﬁguration space coincides with the shortest line in Riemann space
gab D 2.h  U/ıab, while the time of motion coincides with the length of this line
in Riemann space Gab D
ıab
2.hU/.
This geometrization has been called formal since the metric has no relationship
with the physical space-time metric that appears in the general relativity for the
description of gravity. Besides, the metric associated with a given system depends on
its total energy. That is, the conﬁguration-space particles with different total energy
probe different geometries.

space, with the aim of giving a more systematic description of a potential motion as
free motion in Riemann space. Besides, our purpose is to discuss certain concepts
such as covariance and coordinate independence, which are important for a proper
understanding of modern physical theories, including gravity and gauge ﬁelds.

write f a.qb/  q0a.qb/. The transition from one description to another

(6.51)
is called a transformation of coordinates. The function q0a.qb/ is known as a
transition function. For the given coordinate systems ',  , the transition function is
deﬁned by f   ı '1, see Fig. 6.1 on page 201. There is no preferable coordinate
system on M; all of them are considered on equal footing. Accordingly, a well-
deﬁned construction on M is one that is deﬁned in relation to each coordinate system
or, in other words, it must be speciﬁed in all the systems simultaneously. In this
section, it is taken for granted that the reader is familiar with the deﬁnition and
basic properties of tensor ﬁelds on M; see Chap. 4 in [15]. For later use, we recall
the deﬁnition of a contravariant vector ﬁeld or .1; 0/ -rank tensor). It is said that
the contravariant vector ﬁeld .q/ is deﬁned on M, if in any coordinate system qa
the set of functions a.qb/ is given, such that the coordinate transformation (6.51)

(6.54)
As compared with a general transformation of the form 0a.q0c/ D Fa.b; qc//,
the tensor transformation law (6.52) is linear and homogeneous with respect to a.
Owing to this fact, tensor ﬁelds form a linear space: a linear combination of tensors
of the same rank is a tensor. In particular, vector ﬁelds form a (inﬁnite-dimensional)
linear space, while vectors at a given point q form an n-dimensional linear space
Tq.M/ known as the tangent space to M. Besides, one can deﬁne the product and
contraction of the tensor ﬁelds. In practical computations it is often convenient to
use the notation
qa0  q0a;
a0  0a;
(6.55)
and so on. This allows us to better control the position of the indices in various
equations. In particular, Eq. (6.52) in this notation acquires the form
a0 D @qa0
@qa a;
(6.56)
where a and a0 stand for different indices.
Example (and exercises)
1. According to Eq. (6.52), if all the components of a vector vanish in a
coordinate system, they also vanish in any other system. That is, the
set (6.53) of columns composed of zeros is an example of a vector.

the difference of coordinates of the points q1, q2 in the system qa, and so

obtain a tensor ﬁeld which is different from the previous one.
These two examples show that the usual derivative is not a very useful notion
on the space of tensors.
Construction Generalizing the last example, it is easy to construct examples of
vector (tensor) ﬁelds. Starting from the given functions a.qb/ referring to the

It is worth noting that applying the above construction to the components a.qb/
of the given vector ﬁeld .q/, we obtain the ﬁeld itself.

Covariant Derivative and Riemann Connection

for the derivative along the curve qa./: da.q.//

follows. Starting from the vector ﬁeld .q/, let us construct the set

map D of .1; 0/-rank tensor space in the space of .1; 1/-rank tensors. It is called the
covariant derivative of the vector ﬁeld . The tensor transformation law of Dba
is supplied by the non-tensor transformation law (6.66) of the afﬁne connection.

So, the covariant derivative (6.69) is a map that takes .k; m/-rank tensors to tensors
of .k; mC1/-rank, and has the usual properties of a derivative: it is a linear map that
obeys the Leibnitz rule. Besides, it commutes with the contractions.

Afﬁne connection on a manifold is not unique (any set of functions abc, given
in the system qa, can be used to create an afﬁne connection (6.66) using the
construction described in the previous section). In Riemann space we can ﬁx the
connection from the requirement that it must respect the metrical properties. In
Euclidean space the scalar product of the constant ﬁelds has the same value at

Parallel Transport: Notions of Covariance
and Coordinate Independence
Vectors of the tangent space Tq.M/ form a linear space, hence two vectors can be
compared by comparing their coordinates. In the Euclidean case, it is possible to
connect tangent spaces at different points introducing a natural notion of parallel
transport. This possibility is based on two properties: (a) the vector can be identiﬁed
with the ordered pair of points of E, (b) the only straight line parallel to a given
one passes through a point of E. Since the transport is deﬁned in a unique way, we
have the possibility of comparing vectors taken at different points. While Riemann
space does not admit such properties, a useful notion of parallel transport along a
line can also be established. However, it does not resemble all the properties of the
Euclidean case (the transport generally depends on the line; therefore, it does not
imply a way to compare tangent spaces at different points).
Parallel transport of the vector 1 given at the point q1 along the line  can be
deﬁned as follows. Consider the manifold M with an afﬁne connection. Let  be
a line between q1 and q2; c: .1; 2/ ! M represents the corresponding curve and
qa./ is its expression in local coordinates. Let 1 be a vector at q1.

determines a vector ﬁeld along the line.9 It is called the parallel transport of 1.
Sometimes we write D.q.// instead of D to emphasize that the problem (6.79) is
formulated for a particular parametrization qa./ of the line.
The vector ﬁeld a.q/, given along the line qa./, is called parallel if it obeys
the Eq. (6.79). In this case the parallel transport of the vector a.q1/ to the point q2
gives the vector that coincides with a.q2/.
We need to verify the consistency of the deﬁnition: whether the set (6.78) really
does give the vector ﬁeld, as well as its independence from the parametrization
implied in the deﬁnition.
Let us conﬁrm that the set (6.78) actually determines a vector ﬁeld. Let the
functions a./ obey the problem (6.79), (6.80) in the coordinates qa (note that the
problem has a unique solution since the Eq. (6.79) form the normal system), while

Comments 1. Covariance of Equations and Coordinate Independence. Let us
mention a slightly different treatment frequently implicit in coordinate constructions
of the type (6.79). We can ﬁnd the solution a./ in the coordinate system qa,
then construct the functions 0a (6.52) in the system q0a, and so on, according
to the procedure described on page 203. By construction, it gives a vector ﬁeld.
In this case we need to conﬁrm that the resulting ﬁeld does not depend on the

6.3
Basic Notions of Riemann Geometry
211
choice of the particular coordinate system qa used in its construction. We now
demonstrate that this coordinate independence is guaranteed by a property of the
deﬁning equation (6.79) known as its covariance.
For the present treatment of the problem, all the constituents of Eq. (6.79) have
the well-established transformation properties (6.52), (6.66) and (6.60) under the
coordinate transformations (6.51). Using them, the equation can be identically
rewritten in terms of the quantities related with the system q0a. We obtain
Da D @qa
@q0b D00b D 0;
(6.89)
where
D00b D d0b
d C 0bcd Pq0c0d D 0;
(6.90)
which is precisely Eq. (6.79) in the primed system. Further, since det @qa
@q0b ¤ 0, the
equation D D 0 is equivalent to D00 D 0. Hence, the equation of parallel transport
preserves its form when we pass from one system to another. This property is called
covariance of the equation under coordinate transformations. Note that covariance
is neither a general nor a self-evident fact. For example, the equation of a circle
x2 C y2 D 1 in polar coordinates acquires the form r D 1 instead of r2 C 2 D 1,
and hence is non-covariant.
Now we are ready to prove the coordinate independence. Suppose that the
parallel ﬁeld has been constructed starting from the system q0a: D0a
D 0,
.1/ D 0a
1. Note that the functions 0a./ obey this problem due to the covariance
property (6.89): D00a 	 Da D 0, then a D 0a. Hence a./ determines the same
ﬁeld ./, which shows its coordinate independence.
2. Parallel and Covariantly Constant Fields. According to the known theorem,
parallel transport turns out to be line-independent in Riemann space with curvature
tensor equal to zero. In the general case, parallel transport depends on the line,
as the deﬁning Eq.(6.79) contains Pq./. Nevertheless it can happen that parallel
transport of a particular vector is line-independent. As an example, let us consider
the covariantly constant ﬁeld a.q/. Due to Eq. (6.71), it turns out to be parallel
along any curve
Da D Pqb ŒDbajq./ D 0:
(6.91)
Accordingly, parallel transport of .q1/ to a point q2 along any line, gives a vector
of the ﬁeld itself at q2. Hence the transport of .q1/ does not depend on the line
chosen.10
Let us ﬁnish this section with two illustrative examples.
10Let us point out that Eq. (6.79) itself cannot be rewritten in terms of Db.

Second Law of Newton in Curvilinear Coordinates Consider Euclidean space

@a0U.x0/ can be written in the form DPqa D gab@bU.q/. On the left-hand side
the covariant derivative (6.79) of the vector Pqa appears. In Sect. 6.8 we show how
the potential U can be incorporated into the connection coefﬁcients, thus obtaining
the interpretation of the law of Newton in terms of parallel transport.
Free Motion on a Sphere Riemann geometry naturally arises in the description
of dynamical systems with kinematical constraints. Consider the unit-mass particle

x2 D x2, x3 D

1.xa/2 is the metric on the sphere induced by the Euclidean
scalar product of the environment space. The corresponding Riemann connection

of the action leads to the equations of motion Rxa C abcPxbPxc D 0, where the
Riemann connection coefﬁcients appear automatically in the course of the variation.
According to Eq. (6.79), the equations of motion mean that the velocity Pxa is the
parallel vector ﬁeld along the particle trajectory. It implies that the trajectory is the
shortest line on the sphere; see Sect. 6.7.

The Geodesic Line and Its Reparametrization Covariant
Equation
A straight line in Euclidean space can be characterized by any one of the following
properties: (a) a tangent vector to the straight line remains a tangent in the course
of its parallel transport along the line; (b) among all the lines between two points
the straight line has the minimal length. In the Riemann case, the ﬁrst property is
taken as a basis for the notion of a geodesic line, while the second one deﬁnes the
shortest line. Since the metrical and parallel transport properties are determined by
two independent quantities (by the metric tensor and by afﬁne connection), the lines
are different, unless a Riemann connection in Riemann space is chosen. As will
be seen in Sect. 6.8, classical mechanics prefers Riemann space with special afﬁne
connection.
6.5.1
Reparametrization Covariant Equation of the Geodesic

Let us obtain a differential equation determining the geodesic line . Let qa./,
qa.1/ D qa
1 be a parametrization of the geodesic line, and a./ is the parallel
vector ﬁeld obtained by the transport of a vector 1.q1/ tangent to the geodesic line.
According to the above deﬁnition we can write
˛./a./ D Pqa./;

where ˛1 D ˛.1/. Hence, if  is the geodesic line, any parametrization qa./ of it
obeys this equation for a certain ˛./. Conversely, if the functions qa./, ˛./ obey
the problem (6.101), (6.102), the tangent ﬁeld a  1
˛ Pqa obeys Eq. (6.79) and thus
is a parallel ﬁeld along the curve qa./. Hence the curve parameterizes a geodesic
line.
The Eq. (6.101) represent a system of n second order equations for nC1 unknown
functions qa./, ˛./. This implies that the solution to the problem (6.101), (6.102)
is not unique. This ambiguity is not surprising, since the geodesic line, being a set of
points in Riemann space, can be parameterized in various ways. We show now that
this ambiguity is exclusively due to the reparametrizations. Besides, any particular
parametrization is speciﬁed by the choice of the function ˛.
To start with, we show that any solution to the problem (6.101), (6.102)
determines the same geodesic line. In other words, a unique geodesic line passes
through a given point in a given direction. We also show that, given two solutions to
the problem, qa./; ˛./ and ya.0/; ˇ.0/, the functions qa./ and ya.0/ represent
parameterizations of the same line.

(6.106)
So, any two solutions are related by Eqs. (6.104) and (6.106) with a function .0/.
This implies that different functions ˛ ¤ ˇ lead to different parameterizations qa ¤
ya. We can say that the set of solutions is “parameterized” by an arbitrary function
˛./.
Combining the results, the problem (6.101), (6.102) is ambiguous, the complete
set of solutions being composed of the pairs qa./, ˛./, where ˛./ is an
arbitrary function and qa./ is the unique solution to the problem with ˛ substituted
into Eq. (6.101). The set is in one-to-one correspondence with the set fqa./g of
parameterizations of the same geodesic line. The ﬁxation of the function ˛ in the
geodesic Eq. (6.101) is thus equivalent to a choice of a particular parametrization of
the geodesic line.
Let us stress that, being of geometric origin, problem (6.101) itself has no
dynamical content: while it determines the geodesic line, it does not imply any
deﬁnite dependence on the parameter . For each given parametrization qa./ of
the line, there is ˛./ such that the pair qa, ˛ obeys the problem. The dynamics can
be “created” by hand, and we do this below specifying the function ˛./.
Equation (6.100) shows that Pqa./ is not a parallel ﬁeld unless ˛ ¤ const. The
same conclusion follows from the comparison of Eqs. (6.79) and (6.101).
Geodesic Equation in Canonical Parametrization According to the previous
analysis, the function ˛ in the geodesic Eq.(6.101) acquires any desired form after
an appropriate choice of parametrization. In particular, there is a parametrization
such that ˛ D 1. Then Eq. (6.101) acquires a more simple form
Rqa C abcPqbPqc D 0:
(6.107)
Comparing it with the parallel transport Eq. (6.79) we conclude that in this
parametrization the tangent vector Pqa to the curve qa./ turns out to be a parallel
ﬁeld. The parametrization is known as the canonical parametrization of the
geodesic line. In contrast to Eq. (6.101), the Eq.(6.107) is not covariant under
reparametrizations.
Recall that parallel transport preserves the length of the transported vector:
g.PqPq/ D v2 D const for all . Then the curve Qqa  qa  1

represents the
canonical parametrization with the unit tangent vector. It is known as the natural
parametrization.

The surface S in the three-dimensional Euclidean space E can be naturally endowed

of E. Then various Riemann space constructions acquire a simple geometric
interpretation in terms of the Euclidean geometry of the environment space.

Parallel Transport According to Eqs. (6.109) and (6.88), parallel transport along
a curve of S preserves the (Euclidean) angle between any pair of transported vectors
EV and EW. Let the curve be the geodesic line and EW represent its tangent vector.
Then parallel transport preserves the angle between EV and the line; see Fig. 6.6 on

the variational problem (6.115) with ﬁxed ends. Owing to the reparametrization

from Eq. (6.117). To analyze the ambiguity, let us ﬁnd the equations determining

Some important relativistic models (particle, string, membrane) are usually for-
mulated in terms of the reparametrization invariant action functionals (in this
formulation a relativistic invariance turns out to be manifest, see Sects. 1.7.4 and
Sect. 7.4). So, the functional (6.115) represents a good laboratory for discussion
of this kind of model. If we try to treat Eq. (6.115) as an action functional of a

quence of the reparametrization invariance of the functional. The reparametrization
invariance (6.117) clearly shows that the Eq. (6.118) do not specify any deﬁnite
law for propagation of the “particle” qa along the line. This means that in the
reparametrization invariant Lagrangian theory the parameter  cannot be considered
to be a parameter of evolution.
The geodesic line Eq. (6.101) has similar properties; see page 216. Moreover,
comparing Eqs. (6.107) and (6.118), we conclude that any solution to the geodesic
equation in canonical parametrization obeys (6.118). We now demonstrate that this
is not merely a coincidence.
Consider a Riemann space with the metric g and the Riemann connection .g/.

In particular, let us decompose the vector t from Eq.(6.122): t D tk C t?. Then
the shortest-line Eq. (6.118) reads t? D 0, giving a restriction on the transverse part

According to Sect. 6.2, equations for the trajectory of a potential motion can be
identiﬁed with the geodesic line equations in canonical parametrization. As we
have seen, in this parametrization the evolution parameter  does not correspond to
the physical (classical mechanical) time. Our purpose now is to ﬁnd the geometric
condition that picks out physical time among all the possible parameterizations of
the geodesic line. First we look for the equations of geometric origin that could
describe the complete problem. We demonstrate that equations of motion in a given
potential can be identiﬁed with the geodesic equation in a special parametrization
on a manifold with the afﬁne connection speciﬁed by the potential. Further, the
manifold can be equipped with an appropriate metric, which is also speciﬁed by the
potential. Then, the special parametrization can be ﬁxed from the pure geometric
condition that the tangent vector to the geodesic curve has a unit length in this
metric. That is we have geodesic motion with unit speed. In this way, we arrive
at the fully geometric treatment of the potential motion problem.

By analogy with Eq. (6.107), the Eq. (6.134) can be called the geodesic equation in
dynamical parametrization.13
The equation obtained is not yet of geometric origin, since the particular
parametrization has little sense from the geometric point of view. We now improve
it by pointing out a geometric condition equivalent to the parametrization. In the
above construction we dealt with n differential equations for n unknown functions
qa./. The geometric condition can be formulated in a slightly different context of
n C 1 equations for n C 1 variables. We return to the reparametrization-covariant
Eq. (6.101) with an arbitrary function ˛./, and add one more equation that implies
ﬁxation of ˛ according to (6.135). For the equation, the natural candidate is the

This problem turns out to be equivalent to the potential motion problems (6.130)
and (6.131). To conﬁrm this statement, let qa./, ˛./ be a solution to the problem.
The Eq. (6.137) implies that the vector ﬁeld a D 1
˛ Pqa is parallel along the geodesic
line; see Sect. 6.5. Since our afﬁne connection looks like the Riemann connection
constructed on the base of tensor gab D 2.h  U/cab, the vector  obeys (see
Eq. (6.88)) g.; / D v2 D const, or, equivalently, 2.hU/cab

Eq. (6.138), we conclude that ˛ D

v
. With this ˛, the Eq.(6.137) coincides
with the Eq. (6.134). Therefore the functions qa./ describe the potential motion.
To sum up, the potential motion problem (6.130), (6.131) can be described in
geometric terms as follows. The conﬁguration space is endowed with the Riemann
space structure introducing the metric Gab D
cab
2.hU/ and the afﬁne connection (6.75)
constructed on the base of the tensor gab D 2.h  U/cab. Then the conﬁguration
space particle qa./ with total energy h moves along the geodesic line with unit
speed computed with respect to the metric G. The motion can be described by
equations of geometric origin (6.137) and (6.138). Equation (6.137) states that the
particle chooses the geodesic line as the trajectory of motion. Equation (6.138)
means that among all the parameterizations of the geodesic line, the particle chooses
the one that implies its unit speed with respect to the metric G.
6.9
Three-Dimensional Acceleration and Speed of Light
in General Relativity
To describe gravitational forces in the theory of general relativity [15, 16], we
replace the Minkowski space by a four-dimensional Lorentz manifold (that is a
manifold with metric of signature .; C; C; C/)
M.1;3/ D fx	; g	
.x/; g00 < 0g:
(6.139)
This implies that instead of Lorentz transformations we now deal with a general
transformations of coordinates (6.51), so equations of general relativity should
be written in a covariant form with respect to these transformations. For a given
distribution of material bodies, metric is determined according to Einstein equations.
The metric represents a gravitational force in the following sense: equations of
motion of a point particle follows from the variational problem (6.115), that is its

trajectory is a geodesic line. Hence in a gravitational ﬁeld the particle follows a
shortest line of the metric g	
, instead of a straight line in absence of the gravity.
To discuss the physics behind this abstract four-dimensional construction, we
should establish a correspondence between the quantities computed in an arbitrary
coordinates of the Riemann space and the three-dimensional quantities used by
an observer in his laboratory. We discuss the most simple part of this problem
which consist in determining of basic differential quantities of three-dimensional
geometry: inﬁnitesimal distances, time intervals, velocity and acceleration.
An interesting subject that will be discussed in this context is the notion of speed
of light in general relativity. By construction of Lorentz transformations, the speed
of light in special relativity is an observer-independent quantity. In a curved space
we replace the Lorentz transformations on the general-coordinate ones, so we need
to ensure the coordinate-independence of the speed of light for that case. It turns
out that this essentially determines the relationship between the four and three-
dimensional geometries. In particular, we deﬁne the three-dimensional acceleration
which guarantees that the particle propagating along a four-dimensional geodesic
can not exceed the speed of light. These results will be used in Chap.9 for discussion
of a rotating body in general relativity in the ultra-relativistic limit.
Coordinate Independence of Speed of Light Consider an observer that label
events by some coordinates of pseudo Riemann space (6.139) to describe the motion

This equality holds in any coordinate system x	. Hence a particle with the

statement. The value of the constant c, introduced by hand, is ﬁxed from the ﬂat

These rather formal tricks are based [16] on the notion of simultaneity in general
relativity and on the analysis of ﬂat limit. As we saw in Sect. 1.3, four-interval of
special relativity has direct physical interpretation in two cases. First, for two events
which occur at the same point, the four-interval is proportional to time interval, dt D
 ds
c . Second, for simultaneous events the four-interval coincides with distance, dl D
ds. Assuming that the same holds in general relativity, let us analyze inﬁnitesimal
time interval and distance between two events with coordinates x	 and x	 C dx	.
The world line y	 D .y0; y D const/ is associated with laboratory clock placed at
the spatial point y. So the time-interval between the events .y0; y/ and .y0 C dy0; y/

Three-Dimensional Acceleration and Speed of Light in General Relativity
231
To deﬁne an acceleration of a particle in the three-dimensional geometry, we
need the notion of a constant vector ﬁeld (or, equivalently, the parallel-transport
equation). In the case of stationary ﬁeld, g	
.xk/, we can identify the curve xi.x0/
of M.1;3/ with that of any one of M3
x0 D fxk; ij.xk/g. So we have the usual
three-dimensional Riemann geometry, and an analog of a constant vector ﬁeld of
Euclidean geometry is the covariantly-constant ﬁeld along the line xi.x0/, D0i D 0.
For the ﬁeld of velocity, its deviation from the covariant constancy is the acceleration

To deﬁne an acceleration in general case, ij.x0; xi/, we need to adopt some notion
of a constant vector ﬁeld along the trajectory xi.x0/, that cross the family M3

Euclidean space the scalar product of two constant ﬁelds does not depend on the
point where it was computed. In particular, taking the scalar product along a line
xi.x0/, we have
d

demand the same (necessary) condition:

Maximum Speed of a Particle in Gravitational Field The extra-term appeared
in this equation plays an essential role to provide that longitudinal acceleration
of geodesic particle vanishes as v ! c. As a consequence, the particle in a
gravitational ﬁeld can not exceed the speed of light. To show this, we compute the

they have sense even for v > c. Without this factor, we would have va ¤ 0 as

Chapter 7
Transformations, Symmetries and Noether
Theorem
Abstract It was mentioned in Sect. 2.5 that conservation laws play an important
role in the analysis of classical and quantum systems. This chapter is mainly devoted
to discussion of the ﬁrst Noether theorem (Noether, Invariant variation problems.
Gott. Nachr. 235 (1918); Transp. Theory Stat. Phys. 1(3), 183, 1971) which gives
the relationship between the existence of conservation laws for the system in
question, and global symmetries of the associated action functional. The symmetries
usually have a certain physical interpretation; in particular, they may reﬂect some
fundamental properties assumed for our space-time: homogeneity, isotropy, ....
In this case, the Noether theorem states that conservation laws are consequences
of these properties. For example, symmetry under spatial translations implies the
conservation of the total momentum of a system.

To demonstrate an idea of the Noether theorem, let us consider the following
special situation. Starting from any given trajectory qa./, let q0a./ D qa./ C
Ra.q.//! be a family of trajectories parameterized by the parameter !. Here
Ra.q/ is a given function. Suppose that the Lagrangian action is invariant under the
substitution q ! q0, that is SŒq0 D SŒq, for any given q./ and !. In particular, the
variation of the action must also be zero: ıS D SŒq0
ˇˇˇlinear on !part  SŒq D 0. On
other hand, the variation is given by the well-known expression ıS D ıS
ıqR C . @L
@PqR/.
Due to invariance, we obtain . @L

Transformations, Symmetries and Noether Theorem
Besides the Noether theorem, we discuss some closely-related topics: the notion
of local symmetry, the notion of symmetry for equations of motion, its relationship
with the symmetry of an action, the relationship between the Lagrangian and
Hamiltonian symmetries, Galileo and Poincaré symmetry groups and so on. The
reader who is interested only in the Noether theorem can skip to the corresponding
section after reading the ﬁrst one.
7.1
The Notion of Invariant Action Functional
Here we discuss the intuitive notion of invariant action with simple examples. Exact
deﬁnitions will be given in the next section. Consider a free particle action functional
S D 1
2
Z
dtPxaPxa:
(7.1)
Given the numeric matrix Rab, let us make the following formal substitution
xa ! Rabxb;
(7.2)
in Eq. (7.1). It gives a functional that is generally different from (7.1),
1
2
R dt.RTR/abPxaPxb. But for the orthogonal matrix, RTR D 1, the substitution does
not change the Lagrangian as well as the action functional
1
2
Z
dt.RTR/abPxaPxb D 1
2
Z
dtPxaPxa; that is SŒRx D SŒx:
(7.3)
In this case it is said that the action is invariant, and the corresponding substitution
is called a symmetry transformation of the action.
It should be noted that an action functional is an operation deﬁned on functions
f a./ instead of coordinates xa. So consistent treatment of Eq.(7.3) implies that we
work with the function xa D f a./ and assign to it the function xa D f 0a./ 
Rabf b./ induced by the substitution (7.2). Bearing in mind this correction, the
above-mentioned terminology is reasonable.
To show the meaning of invariance property (7.3) we remind its two applica-
tions.
(A) The symmetry turns solutions to equations of motion into other solutions. So
in practice it can be used to construct new solutions from known ones.
To conﬁrm this, take a trajectory xa D f a.t/, and construct another one,
xa D f 0a.t/  Rabf b.t/, induced by the substitution (7.2). Invariance implies
that the action has the same value on these trajectories, SŒ f 0 D SŒ f. Consider
now a set of trajectories ff a; ga; : : :g with the same initial and ﬁnal points, and
let f represent the true trajectory, that is SŒ f  SŒg for all g of the set. All the

7.1
The Notion of Invariant Action Functional
237
transformed trajectories ff 0; g0; : : :g have the same initial and ﬁnal points. Due
to the invariance, one obtains SŒ f 0  SŒg0.
(B) Recall that an orthogonal matrix corresponds to a rotation of the cartesian axis.
So we identify the substitution (7.2) with a transformation relating cartesian
coordinates xa and x0a used by two observers, O and O0
x0a D Rabxb;
(7.4)
Now x and x0 stand for coordinates of the same point of conﬁguration space. If
O uses the functions xa D f a.t/ to describe a trajectory, the observer O0 will
describe it by the function x0a D Rabf b.t/. According to Sect. 1.4.2, to study the
motion, O0 can use an action obtained from (7.1) by the change of variables,
xa D QRabx0b, where QR is the inverse matrix for R. It reads

2
Z
dt. QRT QR/abPx0aPx0b D 1

dtPx0aPx0a D SŒx0:

The second equality is due to the invariance. That is an invariance guarantees
that O0, describing the system, can take the same action as O, simply using his
own coordinates x0 instead of x. This implies an identical form of equations of
motion in the two systems. If F.x; Px/ D 0 stands for an equation obtained by
O, then F.x0; Px0/ D 0 with the same F represents this equation in the system O0.
One can say that physical laws have an identical form in the coordinate systems
O and O0.

These transformations will be taken as the starting point of our discussion in the next
section. The deﬁnitions given below equally work for global and local symmetries.
Comments (1) An example of a transformation with 0 dependent on qa is the
relativistic particle. An example of a transformation with q0 dependent on  is the
Galileo boost. We also point out that a typical form of transformations in classical
(non relativistic) mechanics is either 0 D ˛./, q0 D q; or 0 D , q0 D  .; q/.
That is, either  or q remains unaffected. In contrast, the form (7.12) turns out to
be typical for symmetry transformations in ﬁeld theories (with the corresponding
substitutions  ! x	, qa ! 'a.x	/ ).
(2) In general, neither a composition nor an inverse transformation are guaranteed
to be members of a family. But the families arising in physical applications typically
possess these additional properties, forming the so called Lie groups.
Suppose a family of transformations obeys the following properties. (A) The
product (that is, a consecutive application) of two transformations of the family
is a member of the family as well: g.!2/g.!1/ D g.!3.!2; !1//. (B) The family
contains a unit. It is an element e with the property eg D ge D g for any g (for our
case it is the identity transformation, e D g.0/, see (7.17)). (C) For any g an inverse
transformation Qg is a member of the family, that is Qg D g.!/ for some !. A family
equipped with a product obeying these properties is precisely a Lie group.
(3) The families of transformations discussed above are examples of a Lie group.
Speciﬁcally, for the Galileo boosts g.va/ W xa ! x0a D xa C vat, note that x00a D

given by Qg D g.va/.

Coordinate Transformation, Induced Transformation
of Dynamical Variables and Symmetries of an Action
We present here two equivalent deﬁnitions for an action symmetry. We start from the
deﬁnition that makes the concept clear and then deduce from it the other one, usually
used in practical calculations. It is worth noting that the notion of symmetry and the
Noether theorem work both for mechanical and ﬁeld theories that can be described
by equations of motion obtained from the variational problem for a functional. It
can be a Lagrangian or Hamiltonian action functional, or some other. We start from
the Euler–Lagrange equations. The Hamiltonian version of the Noether theorem is
discussed in Sect. 7.12.
Consider a dynamical system described by equations of motion following from

Equation (7.15) represents a coordinate transformation, while an action func-
tional is an operation deﬁned on functions. To formulate consistently how S is
affected by a coordinate transformation, we need to decide how the map g acts
on a function f a./. We identify the function with its graph in extended space (see
Fig. 7.1 on page 241)
f D f.; f a.//;   Œ1; 2g:
(7.18)
The map g transforms it into another graph, f 0, and the problem is to ﬁnd the
corresponding function f 0./. This leads to the following rule for transformation of
a function:
g W f a./ ! f 0a./   a. Q˛./; f. Q˛.///;
  Œ˛.1; f.1//; ˛.2; f.2//:

Here Q˛./ is, for each given f(), an inverse function for ˛.; f./; !˛/ considered
as a function of , that is:
˛. Q˛./; f. Q˛.// D Q˛.˛.; f.// D :

Indeed, under the map g the point  D ; q D f./ goes over to the point with
coordinates
 D ˛.; f.//;
q D  .; f.//:
(7.21)
The equalities represent the parametric equations of the graph f 0. Resolving the
ﬁrst equation with respect to ;  D Q˛./, and using this to eliminate the parameter
from the second equation, we arrive at Eq. (7.19).

Let us stress that Eq.(7.23) represents equality of two numbers. In particular,
in many practically interesting cases, one has N D 0, then for any f and the
corresponding f 0, the number SŒ f 0 must be equal to the number S[f].
Note that the inverse function Q˛ appeared in (7.19) depends on a particular f, so
the obtained representation is rather formal. Let us rewrite the invariance condition
in terms of ˛ and  . As it is written, the invariance condition is presented in terms of
the same functional computed on two different functions (initial and transformed).
We now come back to the initial function on the l.h.s. of Eq. (7.23), thus obtaining
the invariance condition in terms of the initial and some transformed functionals,
both computed on the same function. At the end, we obtain the invariance condition
in a form which is convenient for applications, as an algebraic property of a
Lagrangian function under the coordinate transformations (7.15).
To achieve this, we make a change of variables in the deﬁnite integral on l.h.s. of
Eq. (7.23),  D ˛.s; f.s//. Using the identity

looks as a new functional Sg computed for the initial function f./. So, it can be said
that under the transformation (7.15) the initial action transforms into another action.

Intuitively, the physical interpretation of the time translations is that an experi-
ment carried out during the time interval Œ1; 2, can be repeated at a different time:
Œ1 C a; 2 C a. The invariance of the action implies that the same experiment
carried out “today” and “tomorrow” gives identical results, since in both cases
the same trajectory is an extremum of the functional (see Fig. 7.2 on page 244).
Equations (7.33) and (7.35) can be thought of as the mathematical formulation of
homogeneity in time: the properties of a physical system at different times are the
same. As will be seen below, symmetry under time translations implies the energy
conservation law. That is, energy conservation is a consequence of homogeneity in
time.

us conﬁrm that the system obeys the principle of special relativity. We need to show
that the action admits the Poincaré group as a symmetry group. Invariance under the
translations is evident, so, let us discuss the Lorentz transformations

In the general case, the parameter  cannot be eliminated from these equations by
analytic methods, and we are not able to ﬁnd closed expression for f 0a.x0/. In other
words, it can be said that the Lorentz group acts on the physical dynamical variables
f a.x0/ in a higher non-linear way, in contrast to its linear realization in coordinate
space (7.46). This represents a serious obstacle to the investigation of relativistic
theories in terms of physical variables, since the relativistic invariance is not under
control.1 Fortunately, to check an invariance of the action, we do not need to know
f 0. According to Eq. (7.26), it is sufﬁcient to replace x	 in Eq. (7.45) by x0	 given in
Eq. (7.46), and to conﬁrm the validity of the condition (7.29).

(B) The evolution parameter  is not affected by the transformations. According

Of course, there is a price to pay. First, the formulation contains an additional
variable (actually, it involves two evolution parameters,  and x0/. Second, the
theory is singular: det

7.5
Symmetries of Equations of Motion
As before, let g be the coordinate transformation (7.15) (not necessarily a symmetry
of an action), and g W f./ ! f 0./ represent the induced transformation (7.19).
Consider the equations of motion Fa.qa; Pqa; Rqa; / D 0 following from the action
functional (7.14).
Deﬁnition g is a symmetry of the equations of motion, if it maps any solution into
a solution
Fa.f; : : :/ D 0
)
Fa. f 0; : : :/ D 0:
(7.49)
From a pragmatic point of view, the existence of the symmetry facilitates the search
for a general solution to the equations of motion: starting from the known particular
solution qa D f a./, one immediately obtains a family of solutions applying the
transformation g: qa D g 
 f a./ D f 0a.; !˛/, which depends on k arbitrary
constants !˛. Sometimes, when the family is large enough, it is sufﬁcient to ﬁnd
only one particular solution to generate the general solution.
As an illustration, consider a free particle Rxi D 0. The six-parameter transforma-
tions g.Ev; Ea/ W  ! 0 D , xi ! x0i D xi C vi C ai form a symmetry group. In
this case, the induced transformations coincide with the coordinate ones. Note that
xi./ D 0 is a solution to the equations of motion, then x0i D 0 C vi C ai turns out
to be the general solution. Intuitively, a free-moving particle can be obtained from a
particle at rest by the Galileo transformation.

Symmetries of Equations of Motion

There are non-trivial applications of this resource, see Sect. 1.7.8, where we
computed the electromagnetic ﬁeld of a moving charge. In a similar way can be
obtained complete set of independent solutions to the Dirac equation (describing an
electron in the relativistic ﬁeld theory), see [37].
Exercise For the second example, ﬁnd (an invertible) symmetry transforma-
tion such that .cos t; 0/ ! .0; sin t/.
Before discussing the relationship between symmetries of an action and symme-
tries of the corresponding equations of motion, let us consider the following task.
Let f 0 be the image of f under a transformation g. Supposing that f is an extremum
of the functional (7.14), let us to ﬁnd the functional that has f 0 as an extremum.
The transformations (7.15) are invertible, see Eq. (7.16). Let us denote the inverse
transformation as g1. Applied to the point , q it reads
g1 W  ! 0 D Q˛.; q/;
qa ! q0a D Q a.; q/:
(7.52)
This implies transformation of the function f
g1 W f./ ! f 00./:
(7.53)
Exercise Suppose f is the solution to the equations of motion F.q; Pq; Rq; / D
0. Write equations of motion for f 0 (see Sect. 2.1.1).
Starting from the action (7.14), the inverse transformation can be equally used to
construct a transformed action according to Eq.(7.26). We obtain
Sg1Œq D SŒ f 00 D SŒg1f D
Z
d PQ˛L. Q .; q/; .PQ˛/1 PQ .; q/; Q˛/:
(7.54)
Computing Sg1 on f 0, we have Sg1Œf 0 D SŒg1 gf D SŒ f. So, if f 0 is the image
of a function f under the transformation (7.15), then
Sg1Œf 0 D SŒ f:
(7.55)
This resolves the task formulated above: if f is an extremum of S, then f 0 will be
an extremum of Sg1. In other words, if f represents a solution to the equations of
motion following from S, then f 0 obeys equations of motion obtained from Sg1.
Comments It should be mentioned that, if g  G, the inverse transformation is
not generally an element of the family. Nevertheless, if g is a symmetry of the
functional (7.14), the same is true for the inverse transformation (prove this by using

Transformations, Symmetries and Noether Theorem
Deﬁnition 1 of Sect. 7.2). If the family is a Lie group, an inverse transformation
belongs to the group. Suppose that the transformation (7.15) is parameterized by !˛,
and Q!˛ are parameters corresponding to the inverse element. Then, by construction,
the functions Q˛, Q are the group functions: Q˛.!/ D ˛. Q!/, Q .!/ D  . Q!/. The
action (7.54) then simply coincides with (7.26), where ! ! Q!.
We are ready to demonstrate the following remarkable fact: transformations
leaving an action invariant, map solutions to equations of motion into solutions.
Afﬁrmation If the family G is a symmetry of the functional SŒq
D
R
dL.qa; Pqa; /, then G is a symmetry of the corresponding equations of motion.
Proof As we saw above, together with g, the transformation g1 represents a
symmetry of the action. The invariance condition for g1 reads SŒg1f D SŒ f C
R d PN, or, equivalently
Sg1Œq D SŒq C
Z
d PN
(7.56)
Let f be a solution to the equations of motion derived from S. According to
Eq. (7.55), f 0a is a solution to equations of motion derived from Sg1Œq. According
to (7.56), the equations obtained from Sg1.q/ and SŒq coincide. Thus f and f 0 obey
the same equation.
We emphasize that the inverse statement is not true. To conﬁrm this, it is sufﬁcient
to return to the second example of the previous section. Equations RxiCxi D 0 follow
from the action S D S

Here, with use of Eq. (7.17), the transition functions have been expanded, up to a
linear order, in a power series at ! D 0. So, inﬁnitesimal transformations (!  1/
are characterized by the functions G and R, called generators of the transformations.

Comments The Noether theorem gives the charges in terms of generators. It is
possible to write an inverse formula for the generators through a given conserved

Proof As has been discussed in Sect. 7.2, the integrals in Eq.(7.60) can be omitted.
Further, the integrands can be expanded in a power series of !. Since ! are arbitrary
parameters, the identity (7.60) must be satisﬁed for each power order separately.
The result we are interested in appears in the linear order. Let A.!/ D B.!/ be a

combinations of the equations of motion form total derivatives of the charges Q˛.
The Eq. (7.68) are called Noether identities. We discuss below how the Noether

7.7
Inﬁnitesimal Symmetries
The reader possibly observed that only the linear part of the power expansion was
used in the proof of the Noether theorem (we will return to the discussion of that
point in the next section). This justiﬁes the notions of inﬁnitesimal transformation
and inﬁnitesimal symmetry discussed here.
The linear on !˛ coordinate transformation
 ! 0 D  C G˛.; qa/!˛   C ı
qa ! q0a D qa C Ra˛.; qa/!˛  qa C ıqa;
(7.69)
is called inﬁnitesimal transformation. The functions G˛, Ra
˛ are called generators.
With any coordinate transformation can be associated an inﬁnitesimal transforma-
tion. It is obtained keeping the ﬁrst two terms of the power expansion, two see
Eq. (7.57).
Similarly to the general case discussed in Sect. 7.2, the inﬁnitesimal transforma-
tion (7.69) induces transformation of functions, g W qa D f a./ ! qa D f 0a./,
where f 0a./ is given in parametric form by
 D  C G˛.; f a.//!˛
qa D f a./ C Ra˛.; f a.//!˛;
(7.70)
According to Eq. (7.19) this induces the transformation of a function

4Note that in singular theory it can happen that Q  0, which implies identities among the
equations of motion. This is closely related with the presence of local symmetries, see Chap. 8.

for variation of a function. In the books on quantum ﬁeld theory it is called an
inﬁnitesimal transformation of form of a ﬁeld (function).
An inﬁnitesimal transformation (7.69) is an inﬁnitesimal symmetry of an action,

Here f 0 is given by Eq. (7.71), and the notation O(!) means that we keep only the
linear term of the expansion in power series of ! around ! D 0. As compared
with the symmetry condition (7.23), we now require it to be satisﬁed only in linear
order with respect to !. So each symmetry (7.15) implies an inﬁnitesimal symmetry,
which appears as linear in the !˛ part of the symmetry transformation. Note that an
inﬁnitesimal symmetry is not generally a symmetry.
Let us compute the left-hand side of Eq. (7.75). First, take into account integra-
tion limits that give an extra total derivative term

Note that the left-hand side is just the usual variation of a Lagrangian due to the
variation of coordinates Qıqa. Hence the invariance condition (7.75) is equivalent
to the statement that the variation can be presented as a total derivative of some
function. Computing the variation according to the known formula (1.127), we
reproduce the Noether identities (7.68)

Recall that the invariance condition (7.23) is equivalent to Eq. (7.30). The
inﬁnitesimal invariance condition (7.75) can also be written in a similar form; it
is sufﬁcient to replace ˛ !  C ı,  ! q C ıq in Eq. (7.30) and keep only the
linear part. It reads

d :
(7.79)
Computing the linear part, we arrive at the Noether identities once again (do the
computation!).
We can generalize the notion of inﬁnitesimal symmetry, allowing the generator
R in (Eq.(7.71)) to depend on time derivatives of f.
Example An inﬁnitesimal transformation with ı D 0; ıqa D Bab ıS
ıqb , where
Bab is an antisymmetric matrix, represents an inﬁnitesimal symmetry of any
action. Omitting a total derivative, the variation of a Lagrangian reads ıL D
ıS
ıqb Bab ıS
ıqb D 0. This is called a trivial inﬁnitesimal symmetry. Being present
in any action, the trivial symmetry does not lead to physical consequences. In
particular, the corresponding charge vanishes on equations of motion.
In short, we have obtained two formal recipes allowing us to check whether an
inﬁnitesimal transformation (7.69) represents an inﬁnitesimal symmetry of an action
functional. According to Eq. (7.77), we can compute the usual variation of the action
under transformations of the form (7.74) and see whether it can be presented as a
total derivative of some function. Equivalently, we can see whether the left-hand
side of Eq. (7.79) forms a total derivative.
We have also demonstrated that the inﬁnitesimal symmetry condition (7.75),
being equivalent to the Noether identities (7.78), implies the conserved charges.

Transformations, Symmetries and Noether Theorem
7.8
Discussion of the Noether Theorem
Let us return to the discussion of the Noether theorem. A brief inspection of Sect. 7.6
shows that invariance of an action under the symmetry transformations (7.57) is
not necessary in the proof of the Noether theorem. Since only the linear on !˛
part of Eq.(7.60) has been used in the proof, the conservation law is already
guaranteed by the inﬁnitesimal symmetry. This was shown once again in the
previous section: the inﬁnitesimal symmetry condition (7.75) is equivalent to the
Noether identities (7.78), which imply conservation of the charges, Eq. (7.62).
As we saw above, symmetries of an action reﬂect fundamental properties
assumed for our space-time. Since an inﬁnitesimal symmetry is not generally a
symmetry, the question arises whether such properties as homogeneity, isotropy,
and so on are actually related to the existence of conservation laws. Here we ﬁll
this gap by showing that invariance of an action under an inﬁnitesimal symmetry
implies its invariance under certain symmetry.
Recall that, due to the identity ea.x/@xG.x/ D G

ea.x/@xx

, the function f.; x/ D
ea.x/@xx is a formal solution to the equation (see Sect. 2.3)
@f

(7.80)
Besides, it obeys the initial condition f.0; x/ D x.

7.9
Use of Noether Charges for Reduction of the Order
of Equations of Motion
As we have seen, the invariance of an action functional implies a special structure
of the corresponding equations of motion. This is given by Eq. (7.68). Since some
combinations of the equations of motion are total derivatives, they can immediately
be integrated, which simpliﬁes (sometimes solves) the problem to ﬁnd a general
solution. Let us discuss this point in further detail. We demonstrate that knowledge
of k Noether charges allows us to replace the initial system of n second-order Euler-
Lagrange equations by an equivalent system, which has only n  k second-order
equations.
According to the Noether theorem, the equations PQ˛ D 0 are consequences of
equations of motion. So, they can be added to the system, which gives an equivalent
system
ıS
ıqa D 0;
PQ˛ D 0:
(7.88)

Transformations, Symmetries and Noether Theorem
Now some k among the Euler–Lagrange equations are consequences of others, and
thus can be omitted. Indeed, Eq.(7.68) states that there are identities present among
equations of the system (7.88). Suppose that a minor rank of the matrix D is placed
in the upper k lines (if not, this can be achieved by reordering the initial variables qa
in an appropriate way). Thus we write: Da
˛ D .Dˇ
˛; Di
˛/, det Dˇ

ıq D0 ¤ 0. Then the
identity (7.68) can be written in the form ( QD is the inverse matrix for D
˛)

ıq˛ D QD
˛. PQ  Di

ıS

(7.89)
that is, the equations

system (7.88). Then the initial system is equivalent to

i D 1; 2; : : : ; n  k;
Q˛.q; Pq/ D c˛ D const;
˛ D 1; 2; : : : ; k:
(7.90)
This contains n  k second-order equations and k ﬁrst-order equations, that is, the
order has been decreased by k units.
Q˛ are functionally independent, otherwise some of them could be omitted from
the system (7.90). Then we should have a system with a number of equations less
than the number of variables. But this would contradict the theorem of the existence
of a unique solution for normal system of equations.

The basic notions of the previous sections remain true for this case, with the
corresponding replacements: qa ! zi D .qa; pb/, L ! pPq  H.q; p/. Below we
present this reformulation. It is interesting for the following reasons.
(a) The formalism can be applied to Hamiltonian systems that do not admit a
Lagrangian formulation. We have already discussed the Schrödinger equation
as an example of this kind; see Sect. 2.9.1.
(b) Due to certain speciﬁc properties of a phase space, we can go further in
the analysis of Hamiltonian symmetries as compared with Lagrangian ones.
Moreover, this allows us to obtain additional information on Lagrangian
symmetries, giving an expression for Lagrangian symmetry in terms of the
Noether charge; see Eq. (7.146) below.
(c) The tool developed below can be applied to much more complicated case of
local symmetries, see Chap.8.
7.12.1
Inﬁnitesimal Symmetries Given by Canonical
Transformation and by Charge
In this section we obtain the necessary and sufﬁcient condition for an inﬁnitesimal
canonical transformation to be an inﬁnitesimal symmetry. In the next section, with
inﬁnitesimal symmetry of a general form (that is with ı ¤ 0) we associate an
inﬁnitesimal symmetry given by canonical transformation of the form (4.29). The
two symmetries are equivalent in the sense that they yield the same concerved
charge. Hence, looking for inﬁnitesimal symmetries of SH we can restrict our scope
and look for them in the class of canonical transformations.
In the extended phase space .; zi/ D .; qa; pb/ consider an inﬁnitesimal
canonical transformation
ı D 0;
ızi D fzi; Qg;
(7.106)
with the generator Q D Q˛.z; /!˛. Notice that instead of Q one can equally take
Q0 D Q C h˛./!˛ where h˛ stands for an arbitrary z-independent function. The
generators Q and Q0 are equivalent since they produce the same transformation.

Proof As ı D 0, the induced transformation of a function has the same form as

total derivative. The variation reads (see Eq. (2.130))

If Q satisﬁes Eq. (7.107) for any z./, the variation is a total derivative, so
Eq. (7.106) represents a symmetry. Conversely, suppose that ıSH D R d dN

N D N˛!˛. Then Eq.(7.108) implies the Noether identity

Equation (7.111) implies pbıqb  N  Q D h./. If h ¤ 0, we replace the initial Q
with an equivalent generator Q0 D Q C h. Then Eq. (7.112) states that Q0 satisﬁes

being a concerved charge is an inﬁnitesimal symmetry of SH.
Proof According to Sect. 2.5, Q obeys (7.111), then Eq. (7.112) implies that ıSH is
a total derivative.

The generator R contains two blocks: Ri˛ D .Ra˛; Tb˛/, where Ra˛ corresponds to

In turn, this guarantees (see the previous section) that the following canonical

Analysing the Noether identities we can ﬁnd an explicit form of QQızi in terms
of ı; ızi. We compute a derivative with respect to  which appears on l.h.s. of

Transformations, Symmetries and Noether Theorem
Since this is true for any functions q(), p(), the terms in front of Pq, Pp vanish
separately. So Eq. (7.123) decomposes into three identities. Taking into account the
expression (7.120) for the Noether charge, they can be written in the form

Equation (7.124) gives the desired Poisson bracket fzi; Q˛g in terms of ı; ızi.
Comparing (7.124) with (7.122) we ﬁnd QQı through ı
QQı D 0;
QQızi D ızi  fzi; Hgı:
(7.126)
It is also instructive to compare transformations of a function induced by ı; ızi and
by QQızi. Comparing (7.117) with (7.126) we write
Qızi D QQızi C ı0zi;
(7.127)
where ı0zi D .Pzifzi; Hg/ı. ı0zi turns out to be a trivial symmetry of SH. To check
that it obeys the invariance condition, it is sufﬁcient to conﬁrm that the variation
of SH under the transformation can be presented as a total derivative. We obtain
(see (2.130)) ıSH D .Pqa fqa; Hg/ı0pa .Ppa fpa; Hg/ı0qa C.paıqa/:  .paı0qa/:.
In this case N D paıoqa, ı0 D 0, so the Noether charge (7.120) produced by the
symmetry vanishes identically. Hence Qız and QQız are equivalent, leading to the same
Noether identity, conserved charge and so on.
The remaining Eq. (7.125) does not contain any new information. Actually, its
right-hand side reads

so (7.125) is simply the Eq. (7.121).
The results obtained can be summarized as follows. Let ı; ızi be an inﬁnitesimal
symmetry of SH, Qızi stands for the induced transformation of a function and
Q˛.zi; / is the corresponding Noether charge, dQ˛

(7.129)
With the symmetry one associates the transformation
QQı D 0;
QQızi D ızi  fzi; Hgı;
(7.130)
which does not affect the time variable. Then
(a) QQızi is a canonical transformation with the generator being the charge Q,
QQızi D fzi; Q˛g!˛:
(7.131)
(b) Equation (7.129) implies that QQızi is an inﬁnitesimal symmetry of SH. The
corresponding Noether charges are Q˛.
(c) The transformations ı; ızi and QQızi are equivalent, as soon as they generate the
same Noether charges. This can also be seen from comparison of the induced

ﬁnish this section with two comments on the relationship between ﬁnite canonical

modify the Hamiltonian, QH.z0/ D H.z/.
2. We have seen above that an inﬁnitesimal symmetry of SH of a general form can be
replaced by an inﬁnitesimal symmetry that represents a canonical transformation.
And what about a ﬁnite symmetry transformation? Let us take the exponential
of an inﬁnitesimal canonical transformation (7.122) associated with the general

formulations are related by a change of variables that in practice reduces to the
substitution Pqa ! va.q; p; /; see Sect. 2.1.2. So each property of a Lagrangian
formulation has its Hamiltonian counterpart.
The aim of this section is to show the relationship between the inﬁnitesimal

Chapter 8
Hamiltonian Formalism for Singular Theories
Abstract Modern particle and ﬁeld theories often involve auxiliary variables which
have no direct physical meaning. We have seen examples of this kind at the end
of ﬁrst chapter: Lagrangian multipliers for holonomic constraints, forceless Hertz
mechanics, electrodynamics and the relativistic particle. Their auxiliary character is
supplied either by local symmetries presented in the Lagrangian action, or by the
algebraic character of equations of motion for these variables. So, in Lagrangian
formalism we deal with a singular theory. Equations of motion can have rather
a complicated structure, including in general differential equations of the second
and the ﬁrst order as well as algebraic equations. Besides, identities among the
equations can be present in the formulation. As a consequence, there is an ambiguity
in solutions for any given initial conditions. So, the physical content of a theory with
local symmetry is not a simple question. Hamiltonian formalism is well adapted for
the investigation of a singular theory.

variables. So, in Lagrangian formalism we deal with a singular theory. Equations
of motion can have rather a complicated structure, including in general differential
equations of the second and the ﬁrst order as well as algebraic equations. Besides,
identities among the equations can be present (see Eq.(1.297) for the case of
electrodynamics). As a consequence, there is an ambiguity in solutions for any given
initial conditions. So, the physical content of a theory with local symmetry is not a
simple question.
We point out that the appearance of auxiliary variables is mostly due to our
desire to incorporate the manifest Poincaré invariance (and locality) as the leading
principle of formalism. As we have discussed in Sect. 1.7.5, the auxiliary variables
allow us to “decompose” a nonlinear global symmetry carried out on physical
dynamical variables into a linear global symmetry plus a local symmetry.
Hamiltonian formalism is well adapted for the investigation of a singular theory.
The phase-space description allows us to automatically separate the dynamical

part of equations of motion from the algebraic part as well as to analyze the
ambiguity present in solutions of equations of motion. Besides, the transition to
Hamiltonian formulation is a necessary step in the process of canonical quantization
of classical theory. Systematic analysis of an arbitrary singular theory was started
in the pioneer works of Dirac [8] and Bergmann [39], and is posed at present on a
solid mathematical ground [10, 11].
Notation In this chapter it will be convenient to change the notation as follows.
Generalized coordinates of the conﬁguration space are denoted by qA, where A
ranges from 1 to [A], that is [A] stands for the number of variables qA. For the
phase-space variables we write z  .qA; pB/.

Hamiltonization of a Singular Theory: The Recipe
Here we discuss the working recipe for Hamiltonization of a singular theory. We ﬁrst
illustrate the recipe on two simple examples that reveal the improvements that are
necessary when we apply a Hamiltonization procedure of Sect. 2.1.3 to a singular
theory.

Hamiltonization of a Singular Theory: The Recipe

To ﬁnd the Hamiltonian formulation, the ﬁrst step is to solve the deﬁning equations
for momenta
p D @L
@Px D y2Px C xyPy;
 D @L
@Py D x2Py C xyPx:
(8.5)
The ﬁrst equation can be resolved with respect to Px
Px D p
y2  xPy
y :
(8.6)
Its substitution into the second equation gives
G  xp  y D 0:
(8.7)
This is the ﬁrst characteristic property of a singular theory: only some of the
equations determining momenta can be resolved with respect to velocities. The
remaining equations do not contain velocities at all, representing algebraic equations
relating coordinates and momenta. They are called primary constraints of the Dirac
procedure.
As the second step, let us try to construct a Hamiltonian according to the standard
prescription: we write H0 D pPx C Py  L and use Eqs. (8.6) and (8.7) to exclude all
the velocities from this expression. This gives the expression H0 D p2
2y2  1
2x2  1
2y2.
Using the recipe Pz D fz; H0g, we obtain the equations
Px D p
y2 ;
Pp D x;
Py D 0;
P D p2
y3 C y:
(8.8)
Multiply the ﬁrst equation by x, compute a derivative of the resulting expression and
use the other equations of the system, obtaining the consequence .x2/PP D 2 C 2Px2.
This is different from Eq. (8.3).
So, the recipe of Sect. 2.1.3 does not lead to the right Hamiltonian and must be
modiﬁed. According the Dirac procedure, the modiﬁcation is rather nontrivial and is
as follows. We introduce an extended phase space with the coordinates x; y; p; ; v,
where v./ is an additional variable. It is sometimes called the Lagrangian
multiplier. On the reason that will become clear in the next section, we will call
it a velocity. The right Hamiltonian is given by
H D p2
2y2  1
2x2  1
2y2 C v.xp  y/;
(8.9)
that is, we add to H0 the primary constraint multiplied by v. H is called the complete
Hamiltonian.
This is the second characteristic property of a singular theory: the rule for
constructing the Hamiltonian of the theory must be modiﬁed according to Eq. (8.9).

274

Hamiltonian Formalism for Singular Theories
Of course, now we need to do a little work to show that this H leads to the right
dynamics. The Poisson bracket on the extended space is deﬁned in the standard
way, fzi; z jg D !ij, that is it does not involve v: fv; zig D 0. Then (8.9) implies the
Hamiltonian equations
Px D p
y2 C vx;
Pp D x  vp;
Py D vy;
P D p2
y3 C y C v:
(8.10)
Together with the primary constraint (8.7), there are ﬁve equations for ﬁve variables.
We can try to use the algebraic Eq.(8.7) to obtain more algebraic consequences
of the system (8.10), (8.7), if any. This works as follows. Compute the derivative
of G, PG D Pxp C xPp  Py  y P D 0. Use Eq. (8.10) to exclude all the derivatives
appearing in this expression. This gives
T  x2  y2 D 0:
(8.11)
So, the Eqs. (8.10) and (8.7) imply one more algebraic equation; occasionally it is
the second equation from (8.3). This is called the secondary constraint of the Dirac
procedure or the second-stage constraint.
In turn, the derivative of T implies
PT D 2
xp
y2 C vx2 C vy2

D 0;
then
v D  p
2x3 :
(8.12)
Instead of a new constraint, we have obtained an algebraic expression for v in terms
of the phase-space variables. The derivative of this equation can not lead to new
algebraic equations since the equations at our disposal do not allow us to exclude Pv.
Exercise Show that the derivative of a constraint can be computed according
to the formula
PG D fG; Hg;
(8.13)
which is usually used in practice. Reproduce Eqs. (8.11) and (8.12) using this
formula.
Not all equations of the complete system (8.10), (8.7), (8.11) and (8.12) are
independent. Keeping the independent equations only, they read
Px D
p
2x2 ;
Pp D x C p2

(8.15)
Note that the auxiliary variable v has disappeared from the ﬁnal equations.
Equations for the pair x, p do not involve y, , and form a normal system. Equations
for y,  are algebraical.
Now we are ready to conﬁrm that the Hamiltonian equations are equivalent to
the Lagrangian ones. Multiply the ﬁrst equation from (8.14) by x, and compute
the derivative of the resulting expression. Using the Eq. (8.14), it reads .x2/PP D 1.
Together with the ﬁrst equation from (8.15), this reproduces the Lagrangian
dynamics (8.3).

with the integration constants b and c subject to the conditions bc D 0 and b2 D
c2, obey the Eqs. (8.25) and (8.23). According to Eq. (8.26), !a and a is a pair
of mutually orthogonal vectors rotating in their own plane (or, equivalently, in the
plane determined by b and c). The function v./ determines time variation of their
magnitudes.
This is one more characteristic property of a singular theory: the velocities that
have not been determined in the course of the Dirac procedure are not determined
by the complete system of equations of motion either. They enter into solutions

as arbitrary functions. The advantage of the Hamiltonian formalism is that the
arbitrariness is detected and described automatically in the course of the procedure.
By analogy with electrodynamics (see Sect. 1.7.4), dynamical variables with
ambiguous evolution are called non physical variables. Variables with unambiguous
dynamics are called physical variables or observables. Let us look for the observ-
ables of this model. Consider the variables y D
!
j!j, p D j!j and S D Œ!;  (note
that the latter coincides with S deﬁned in (8.21)). As a consequence of (8.25), their
equations do not involve v
Py D p;
Pp D p2y;
PS D 0:
(8.27)
So all them are candidates for the observables. Since S D Œy; p, we can take four
variables y and p as the independent observables. The general solution to their
equations of motion reads
y D 1
jbj

b cos b2t C c sin b2t

; p D jbj

b sin b2t C c cos b2t

;
(8.28)
then jyj D 1 and jpj D b2. The pair rotates in the plane of the vectors b and c with
constant angular velocity equal to b2. As it should be, the local transformations
presented in the model do not alter the observables. To see this, note that Eq. (8.22)
together with the transformation law !a ! !a imply a ! 1
 a. The observables
are invariants of these transformations.
Note that the two examples of a singular theory have essentially different
structure of equations of motion. When all the velocities have been determined
in the course of the Dirac procedure, the singular theory is called non-degenerate
[10]. Otherwise, it is called a singular degenerate theory. It will be seen below
that the difference is encoded in the algebraic properties of constraints with respect
to the Poisson bracket. Local symmetry is a characteristic property of a singular
degenerate theory.

The ﬁrst stage of the Dirac procedure consists of Hamiltonization of the theory.
(1) Introduce conjugate momenta for the variables qA according to the equations
pA D @L.q; Pq/
@PqA
:
(8.31)
They are considered as algebraic equations for determining the velocities
PqA. According to the well-known theorem about implicit function, Eq. (8.30)
guarantees that some [i] velocities among PqA, say Pqi, i D 1; 2; : : : ; Œi, can be
found from these equations. Let us denote the solution as1
Pqi D vi.qA; pj; Pq˛/:
(8.32)
These expressions can be substituted into the remaining [˛] equations for the
momenta (8.31). By construction, the resulting expressions do not depend2 on
Pq˛ and represent the primary constraints ˆ˛.q; p/ of the theory. They read
ˆ˛  p˛  f˛.qA; pj/ D 0;

The Eqs. (8.32) and (8.33) are thus equivalent to the system (8.31).
(2) Introduce an extended phase space parameterized by the coordinates qA; pA; v˛,
and deﬁne a complete Hamiltonian H according to the rule

used to denote the remaining coordinates.
2Indeed, if they depended on one of Pq˛, it would be possible to ﬁnd it in terms of others q and p,
contradicting the rank condition (8.30).

of SH, the variational equation ıSH
ıqA D 0 is equivalent to the Hamiltonian
equation PqA D fqA; Hg, and so on. SH gives us additional opportunities
to study the Hamiltonian equations. For instance, any ˆ˛.q; p/ does not
depends on velocities, and can be considered as a kinematic constraint of the
variational problem. According to Sect. 1.6.3, we can solve the constraint and
substitute the result back into SH, this gives an equivalent variational problem.
The second, third, ...stages of the Dirac procedure consist in revealing all the
algebraic consequences of the system (8.37) and (8.38).
According to Eq. (8.38), all the solutions are conﬁned to lying on a surface of the
extended phase space deﬁned by the algebraic equations ˆ˛ D 0. It may happen that
the system (8.37) and (8.38) contains in reality more then [˛] algebraic equations.
Indeed, computing the derivative of the primary constraints with respect to time and

using (8.37), we obtain the algebraic consequences of the system
fˆ˛; Hg  fˆ˛; ˆˇgvˇ C fˆ˛; H0g D 0:
(8.42)
Henceforth they are called second-stage equations of the Dirac procedure. They can
be added to Eqs. (8.37) and (8.38), which gives an equivalent system.

So they can be omitted from consideration. In many cases we will keep them, with
the aim to preserve the symmetric form of the system (8.37).
Let us analyze the structure of the second-stage system. It is considered as a
system of linear equations for determining the velocities v˛. According to known
theorems of linear algebra, if
rankfˆ˛; ˆˇg D Œ˛0  Œ˛;
(8.44)
then [˛0] equations can be used to represent some v˛0 through other variables. The
velocities v˛0 thus determined can be substituted into the remaining Œ˛00  Œ˛Œ˛0
equations; the resulting expressions do not contain v˛ at all. After doing this, the
second-stage system acquires the form
v˛0 D v˛0.qA; pj; v˛00/;
ˆ˛00.qA; pj/ D 0:
(8.45)
Functionally-independent equations among ˆ˛00 D 0, if any, represent the second-
stage Dirac constraints. Thus all the solutions of the system (8.37) and (8.38) are
conﬁned to lying on the surface deﬁned by ˆ˛ D 0 and by the Eq. (8.45).
The velocities that have been determined can be substituted into the expression
for the complete Hamiltonian.3
The procedure described above can be now repeated for the second-stage
constraints, which can produce non-trivial third-stage algebraic equations,
fˆ00

dynamical equations can be omitted from consideration. If the system (8.46) implies
new constraints, we start the fourth stage of the Dirac procedure, and so on.
Since the number of functionally-independent constraints can not be more than
dimension 2[A] of the phase space, the procedure necessarily stops at some stage,
say N.
The complete set of higher-stage constraints is denoted by ˆa.qA; pj/ D 0 (Latin
indices from the beginning of the alphabet, a, b, c, are used to denote the higher-
stage constraints). Then the complete constraint system is

by the equations ˆ˛ D 0 and (8.48); see Fig. 8.1 on page 281. By construction, after
substitution of the velocities v˛ determined in the course of the Dirac procedure, the
Eq. (8.48) hold on the complete constraint surface ˆI D 0.
In short, after completing the Dirac procedure, the theory can be described by
Hamiltonian equations (8.37) which are accompanied by the constraints (8.47).
Besides, some of the velocities (or all of them) have been determined in the process.
Equivalently, the complete system of equations is given by formulas (8.37), (8.38)
and (8.48). We also repeat (see page 280) that [I] dynamical equations are
consequences of other equations of the complete system (where [I] is the number of
all constraints).

The next step is to show whether the Eqs. (8.60) and (8.61) form a Hamiltonian
system in suitably chosen coordinates of the conﬁguration-velocity space. Our aim
now will be to demonstrate the following

We also introduce the reduced Poisson bracket, that is the Poisson bracket computed
with respect to .qi, pj/-variables only. For the functions A.qA; pi; v˛/, B.qA; pi; v˛/

yet arrived at the Dirac recipe.
Proof of the Assertion To prove the assertion, we will need to know properties
of the transition function vi.qA; pj; v˛/, which is given in an implicit form by

so the quantity QMijMj˛ does not depend on v˛ as well. Remember that a quantity

(8.76)

This implies (see Eq. (8.73)) that the matrix QMij is at most linear on v˛, and has the
representation QMij D @2HR

most linear on v˛ and has the representation

 HR:
(8.82)
Let us summarize the results. Given singular theory, both the transition func-
tion (8.64) and the Lagrangian L.qA; pi; v˛/ are linear functions of the velocities
v˛. The Lagrangian has been presented in terms of the function HR, which is a
linear function of v˛ as well. Besides, the Hamiltonian H0 and the function f˛ do
not depend on v˛.
Using these formulas, the reader can check that Eqs. (8.66), (8.67), (8.68), (8.69),
(8.70), (8.71) and (8.72) can be obtained by direct substitution of the transition
function into the ﬁrst-order Eqs. (8.60), (8.61) and (8.62). Therefore the two
formulations are equivalent.
As in the case of the Dirac procedure, we could now start to look for, from
Eq. (8.68), all the algebraic consequences of the system (8.66), (8.67) and (8.68).
Instead, we now establish the equivalence of the formulation (8.66), (8.67)
and (8.68) with the more symmetric Dirac formulation (8.38), (8.39), (8.40)
and (8.41).
8.2.3
Comparison with the Dirac Recipe
In the previous section the ﬁrst-order equations of motion (8.60), (8.61) and (8.62)
were identically rewritten in special coordinates of 2[A]-dimensional conﬁguration-
velocity space. Let us compare the resulting system (8.66), (8.67) and (8.68) with the
Dirac system (8.38), (8.39), (8.40) and (8.41). The latter is formulated in 2ŒACŒ˛-
dimensional space, where the additional variables are the conjugate momenta p˛ for
q˛. So, to see the equivalence of the two formulations, we need to extend our space
adding the auxiliary variables
.qA; pi; v˛/ ! .qA; pi; p˛; v˛/:
(8.83)
We also complete the reduced bracket (8.65) up to the Poisson bracket, deﬁning
fq˛; pˇg D ı˛ˇ. Let us deﬁne the dynamics on this space as follows. By deﬁnition,
the initial variables .qA; pj; v˛/ obey Eqs. (8.66), (8.67) and (8.68). As the “equations
of motion” for p˛ we take
ˆ˛  p˛  f˛.qA; pj/ D 0;
or
p˛ D @L

ˇˇˇˇ

(8.84)

that is primary Dirac constraints (compare them also with Eq. (8.63). By construc-
tion, the system (8.66), (8.67) and (8.68), (8.84) is equivalent to (8.66), (8.67)
and (8.68). On the other hand, it is equivalent to the Dirac system.
To see this, we notice the relationship between the complete Hamiltonian (8.35)
of the Dirac recipe and our basic quantity HR: H D HR C p˛v˛, and make the
following observations.
(a) We can replace HR ! H in the Eq. (8.66) without altering their form. They then
coincide with (8.39).
(b) Equation (8.67) coincides with (8.40).
(c) Using the complete Poisson bracket, Eq. (8.68) can be written in the form
fˆ˛; Hg D 0, that is, it represents the second-stage system of the Dirac
procedure.
(d) The equation
Pp˛ D  @H
@q˛
(8.85)
is a consequence of Eqs. (8.66), (8.67) and (8.68) and (8.84), as the following
computation shows:

(8.86)
Thus we have reproduced the Dirac system (8.38), (8.39), (8.40) and (8.41),
together with its consequence, which is the second-stage system fˆ˛; Hg D 0.
In the result, we have demonstrated that the Dirac procedure produces a
Hamiltonian formulation which is equivalent to the initial Lagrangian formulation.
The procedure of Hamiltonization can be schematically resumed as follows
.qA; PqA/ ! .qA; vi; v˛/ $ .qA; pi; v˛/ ! .qA; pi; p˛; v˛/:
(8.87)
Some relevant comments are in order.
1. The mysterious Lagrangian multipliers of the Dirac recipe represent just the
velocities that remain “untouched” by the change of variables (8.63).
2. In an arbitrary singular theory, the Hamiltonian H0.qA; pi/ does not depends
on p˛.
3. Our discussion reveals that the only role played by the momenta p˛ is to represent
equations of motion in a completely symmetric form, with the Poisson bracket

deﬁned in relation to all variables qA; pA. The momenta p˛ are, in fact, the
auxiliary variables of a singular theory.
4. Primary and secondary6 constraints have very different origins. The secondary
constraints represent, in fact, part of the initial equations of motion, rewritten in
the Hamiltonian form. The primary constraints, together with the momenta p˛,
have been added by hand, with the aim of obtaining a more symmetric formalism.
Exercise Obtain Eqs. (8.66), (8.67), (8.68), (8.69), (8.70), (8.71) and (8.72)

Let the matrix KIJ.qA; pB/ be invertible on the constraint surface
det KIJˇˇ

(8.88)
Then the functions KIJˆJ are called constraints that are equivalent to the initial
constraints ˆI. Note that the equations ˆI D 0 and KIJˆJ D 0 determine the same
surface in the phase space.
As will be seen below, the structure of Hamiltonian equations (8.37), (8.38)
and (8.48) essentially depends on properties of the constraints ˆI with respect to
the Poisson bracket.
Deﬁnition 1 Let ˆ be either one of the constraints among ˆI or a combination of
ˆI. The constraint ˆ is called a ﬁrst class constraint if its bracket with any constraint

Now we demonstrate the central result on the structure of a constraint system.
Let us denote the Poisson bracket of all constraints by M
fˆI; ˆJg DMIJ .qA; pB/:
(8.91)
Suppose that its rank on the constraint surface is equal to a number ŒI2,
rank MIJjˆID0 D ŒI2 < ŒI. We demonstrate that there is an equivalent system
of constraints formed by ŒI2 second-class constraints, and by ŒI1 D ŒI  ŒI2
ﬁrst-class constraints.
To see this, we note that according to the rank condition, there are ŒI1 D I  ŒI2
independent null-vectors EKI1.qA; pB/ of the matrix M on the surface ˆI D 0. We
denote their components KI1
J. Then, for the combinations QˆI1  KI1
JˆJ, we ﬁnd
f QˆI1; ˆLg D fKI1
J; ˆLgˆJ C KI1
J MJL	 ˆI;
(8.92)
since K M vanishes on surface ˆI
D 0. Hence ˆI1 represent ŒI1 ﬁrst-class
constraints.
Exercise Show that the presence of n ﬁrst-class constraints among ˆI implies
rank MIJjˆID0  ŒI  n.
We can choose the vectors EKI2.qA; pj/ to complete EKI1 up to a basis of [I]-
dimensional vector space. By construction, the matrix
KIJ 

(8.93)
is invertible. Let us denote QˆI  . QˆI1, QˆI2/, where QˆI1  KI1
JˆJ, QˆI2  KI2
JˆJ.
The system QˆI is equivalent to the initial system of constraints ˆI. The constraints
QˆI2 form the second-class subset (prove this!).
Therefore, properties of the set QˆI can be summarized as follows
f QˆI; QˆJg DMIJ .qA; pB/;

where z D .qA; pB/ and ˆI
D .ˆ˛; ˆa/. We have also seen that some of
the dynamical equations of the system are a consequence of other equations. To
continue the analysis, we now separate independent equations.
Since the constraints ˆI D 0 are functionally independent, we can resolve them
with respect to [I] phase-space variables. That is, they can be presented in the form
zI  f I.zNa/ D 0;

Besides, the higher-stage equations allow us to present some of the velocities, say
v˛, through other variables, vˇ D dˇ
N˛.z/Nv N˛. Using all this, the Eq. (8.97) are
equivalent to
PzNa D hNa.zNa; Nv N˛/;

7Recall that we can substitute the velocities v˛.z; Nv Nˇ/ into the complete Hamiltonian before
computing the Poisson brackets, which does not alter the resulting equations of motion.

292
8
Hamiltonian Formalism for Singular Theories
Now it is clear that the velocities Nv N˛ are not determined by these equations, and
“parameterize” the ambiguity presented in solutions of the problem. Indeed, let us
ﬁx Nv N˛./ in some way. Then the Eq. (8.100) represent a normal system and can be
solved under a given initial conditions, for example zNa.0/ D zNa
0. Then we determine
zI, vˇ according to (8.101). The solution of the Cauchy problem is not unique, since
taking some other functions Nv0N˛./ such that Nv0N˛.0/ D Nv N˛.0/, we obtain a different
solution which obeys the same initial conditions.
Moreover, a solution is not unique even for any other set of initial conditions!
To illustrate this, let us discuss the two-dimensional example, Pz D h.z; v/. We solve
the equation with respect to v, v D Qh.z; Pz/. Then the set z./, Qh.z./; Pz.// with an
arbitrary function z./ is a solution of the problem. Due to this, the problem with the
initial conditions z.0/, Pz.0/, : : :, z.n/.0/, v.0/ D Qh.z.0/; Pz.0//, has inﬁnite solutions.
Therefore, for a singular theory, in which some of velocities have not been
determined in the course of the Dirac procedure, it is impossible to formulate
the Cauchy problem for original variables. Given initial conditions, a solution of
the problem is not unique. Moreover, the example 2 of Sect. 8.1.1 shows that
all original variables can have an ambiguous dynamics, in contradiction with an
expected causal evolution of a system. Therefore the original variables generally
have no physical meaning. To ﬁnd the physical content of a degenerate theory, we
look for combinations of original variables with unambiguous dynamics. Certainly,
constraints are of this type, but they have a trivial dynamics. Are there any more
variables with unambiguous dynamics in a degenerate theory? The answer was
given in a remarkable theorem proved by Gitman and Tyutin [10]. It guarantees
that besides the constraints, there are 2ŒA  ŒI2  2ŒI1 independent variables with
unambiguous dynamics. The variables (or functions of them) sometimes are called
physical variables or observables. The subspace of observables is called physical
sector of the theory. Let us brieﬂy discuss the corresponding formalism.
Singular Theory in Special Coordinates As we saw in Sect. 4.4.3, there is time-
independent canonical transformation such that the constraints (8.98) turn into a
part of coordinates of the new system, say I D zI  f I.zNa/. Then all solutions to
equations of motion lie on the hyper-plane I = 0. Further progress in analysis
of equations of motion can be achieved in these new coordinates called special
coordinates. They can be described as follows. The set  consist of 1
2ŒI2 conjugated
pairs .y; / equivalent to second-class constraints from (8.98), and of momenta NP
and QP, they are equivalent to primary and higher-stage ﬁrst-class constraints. So
we have  D f.y; /; NP; QPg. The coordinates corresponding to the momenta are
denoted Q D . NQ; QQ/. The remaining conjugated pairs of the special system we
denote !. Thus the special coordinates are .!; ; Q/.
According to the Gitman-Tyutin theorem [10], in the canonical coordinates the
equations of motion (8.97) acquire the form
P! D f!; Hph.!/g;
 D 0;
PNQ D Nv;
PQQ D B.!; NQ; QQ/;
(8.102)
where Hph and B are known functions of indicated arguments, and Nv are the
undetermined velocities.

8.4
Classical Observables and Physical Content of a Degenerate Theory
293
Now the ambiguity in solutions becomes transparent: varying the functions Nv,
we alter only the variables Q D . NQ; QQ/. The variables ! have unambiguous
dynamics, since the equations for them are separated from others. Equations for
! are Hamiltonian, with the Hamiltonian being Hph.
A classical-mechanics system has unambiguous behavior. If we wish to describe
it by a degenerate theory, we need some convention that will remove the discrepancy
between causal evolution of a physical system and the ambiguity presented in
solutions of Eq. (8.102). The form of these equations suggests the natural possibility
of doing this: the physical dynamics should be associated with the !-sector of a
singular theory. Let us adopt the following terminology:
A. Two solutions (trajectories) Z D .!; ; Q; Nv/ and Z0 D .!0; 0; Q0; Nv0/ to
the system (8.102) are said to be equivalent, Z0 	 Z, if !0 D !. According
to the equivalence relationship, the space of solutions decomposes into non-
intersecting classes QZ of mutually equivalent solutions.
B. A function A is called physical function (observable), if it has the same
values at equal-time points of equivalent trajectories, that is A.Z0; PZ0; RZ0; : : :/ D
A.Z; PZ; RZ; : : :/, when Z0 	 Z.
C. Two observables are equivalent, A 	 A0, if their values coincide on all
trajectories. The space of observables decomposes into non-intersecting classes
QA of mutually equivalent observables.
Some relevant comments are in order. We start from two properties8 of a class of
equivalent trajectories QZ.
1. Ambiguous evolution implies the existence of intersecting trajectories which
obey Z.0/ D Z0.0/ at some 0. Note that intersecting trajectories belong to
the same equivalence class.
2. Let Z./ D .!; ; NQ; QQ; Nv/ be a solution of (8.102), and ı, 4, 41, 42, : : :,
4k given numbers. Then there is an equivalent solution Z0./ (that is with
the same !./), which obeys the conditions QQ0.0/ D

PQQ0./ D B.; QQ0/  BŒ!./; NQ./ C u./; QQ0, QQ0.0/ D QQ.0/ C ı.
Some properties of a class of observables QA.
3. The dynamical variables !./ (as well as the functions a.!/) represent examples
of observables.
4. If A 2 QA, then AjD0 and A C fg are observables of the same class. Here fg
is any function proportional to the constraints, fg D fI.Z/I.
5. In each class QA there is an observable of the form a.!/. As a consequence,
observables have unambiguous dynamics. Indeed, let A1.Z; PZ; RZ; : : :/ is an
observable from QA. Using Eq. (8.102), it can be presented through !, QQ, NQ
8For a detailed description of the class, see [10].

294

Hamiltonian Formalism for Singular Theories
and derivatives of NQ: A2.!; ; QQ; NQ; PNQ; RNQ; : : :/. This function also belong to QA.
Then A2jD0 D a.!; QQ; NQ; PNQ; RNQ; : : :/ 2 QA. According to Item 2, it must obey
a.!; QQ; PNQ; RNQ; : : :/ D a.!; QQ C ı; NQ C 4; PNQ C 41; RNQ C 42; : : :/, and hence is a
function of !, a.!/.
In view of this, we can adopt the following interpretation of a degenerate
theory: we assume that observables describe the measurable quantities.
Since an observable acquires the same value for all trajectories of a given
class, it is not necessary to know all the trajectories for the description of physical
quantities. Since all observables of a class QA describe the same measurable
quantity, we can use only one of them, for instance the representative a.!/.
6. According to this interpretation, the Cauchy problem is formulated for the !-
variables, !.0/ D !0.
7. Another consequence of the interpretation adopted is that the same physical
system can be described by theories with different equations and even with
different numbers of variables.
Consider the theory with the variables ! and the equations of motion P! D
f!; Hphg. It is obtained from the original theory disregarding all the ambiguous
variables. It has the same physical content as the theory (8.102). Note also that it
is a non-singular theory.
Other examples of equivalent formulations can be obtained either by partial
or by complete ﬁxation of the ambiguity presented in Eq.(8.102).
For instance, we can partially ﬁx the dynamics (8.102), adding the equations
NQ D 0, then Nv D 0. Note that there remains the ambiguity related to the choice
of initial conditions for the variables QQ.
Adding the equations NQ
D
0, and replacing the last set of equations
from (8.102) by QQ D Y.!/, where Y.!/ are given functions, we completely
remove the ambiguity. Note that the number of equations that must be added to
completely remove the ambiguity is equal to the number of ﬁrst-class constraints
of the theory.
The transition from the original formulation to the other one, with the
variables of the ambiguous sector ﬁxed in one or another way, is called the
ﬁxation of gauge. The resulting theory is called a gauge of the original theory.
When we work in special coordinates, the original theory and its gauge have the
same physical content.
8. An observable of the form a.!/, being rewritten in the original variables z D
.qA; pB/, has the form a.z/  a.!.z//. Hence measurable quantities can be
described using the observables which are functions of z only. Let Qa be the class
of observables of the form A.z/, with the representative a.z/. To establish the
structure of A.z/, we consider it in special coordinates, A.z/ D A.!; ; Q/ D
A.!; Q/ C fg D a.!/ C fg. The last equality is owing to Item 5. In the
original coordinates it reads A.z/ D a.z/ C fI.z/ˆI.
For an observable of this form we have
fA.z/; ˆI1g D fˆg:
(8.103)

8.4
Classical Observables and Physical Content of a Degenerate Theory
295
Therefore the observables of the form A.z/ commute with all ﬁrst-class con-
straints. Note that the observables a.z/  a.!.z// commute with all constraints.
9. In practical computations, complete ﬁxation of the ambiguity in original vari-
ables is achieved according the following scheme. Let FI1.zA/ be functions such
that the functions ˆ D .ˆI; FI1/ are functionally independent and form the
second-class set on the surface ˆ D 0
detfˆ; ˆgjˆD0 ¤ 0:
(8.104)
We add the equations F.zA/ D 0 to the original system, Pz D fz; Hg and ˆI D
0. The equations are called gauge conditions imposed on the theory. In special
coordinates we will have the Eq. (8.102) accompanied by F.!; ; NQ; QQ/ D 0.
The condition (8.104) guarantees that the gauge conditions can be resolved with
respect to Q. So they can be written in the equivalent form, NQ D NF.!/ and
QQ D QF.!/ (possible dependence of F on  can be discarded in the complete
system). Using them in other equations of the system, we present it as follows:
P! D f!; Hph.!/g;
 D 0;
PNF.!/ D Nv;
PQF.!/ D B.!; NF.!/; QF.!//;
NQ D NF.!/;
QQ D QF.!/:
If the fourth equation is satisﬁed as a consequence of the ﬁrst equation, we
achieved our goal: the theory Pz D fz; Hg, ˆI D 0, FI1 D 0 is self-consistent,
has unambiguous dynamics and the same physical content as the original theory.
To avoid a confusion, we emphasize that complete ﬁxation of a gauge in original
coordinates generally does not mean that we have speciﬁed the physical sector of
the theory.
Search for Observables in Original Coordinates To ﬁnd the special coordi-
nates, we need to solve a complicated system of partial differential equations,
see Sect. 4.4.3. In many cases it is easier to ﬁnd an observables in the origi-
nal coordinates. The analysis of a theory in special coordinates yields certain
hints how we can do this. Since the basic property of an observable is its
causal evolution, we just search for 2ŒA  ŒI2  2ŒI1 independent combinations
zobs.qA; pB/, with unambiguous dynamics governed by closed system of equations.
By closed we mean the system which involves only the variables zobs. According to
Eq. (8.103), the observables necessarily have vanishing brackets with all ﬁrst-class
constraints.

Hamiltonian Formalism for Singular Theories
8.5
Theory with Second-Class Constraints: Dirac Bracket
Consider a singular theory that, after completing the Dirac procedure, leads to the
equations of motion
Pz D fz; Hg;
ˆ˛ D 0;
fˆI; H0g C fˆI; ˆˇgvˇ D 0;
(8.105)
where all the constrains ˆI form the second-class set
fˆI; ˆJg DMIJ;
det MIJjˆKD0 ¤ 0:
(8.106)
The inverse matrix for M is denoted by QMIJ, QMIJ MJKD ıIK.
Applying QM˛I and QMaI to the last equation from (8.105), we obtain
v˛ D  QM˛IfˆI; H0g;
(8.107)
QMaIfˆI; H0g 	 ˆJ:
(8.108)
Substituting these into the ﬁrst equation from (8.105), we obtain Pz D fz; H0g 
fz; ˆ˛g QM˛JfˆJ; H0g. Using Eq. (8.108), this can be written in a more symmetric
form
Pz D fz; H0g  fz; ˆIg QMIJfˆJ; H0g:
(8.109)
Repeating the analysis carried out in Sect. 8.4 (see Eqs. (8.98), (8.99), (8.100)
and (8.101) ), we conclude that the dynamics of the theory is governed by
PzNa D hNa.zNa/;
(8.110)
zI D f I.zNa/;
v˛ D  QM˛IfˆI; H0g:
(8.111)
Thus, in a singular theory with second-class constraints, all the velocities are
determined algebraically through the phase-space variables. The dynamics is
unambiguous. The variables zNa obey the ﬁrst-order equations, so there is a natural
formulation of the Cauchy problem, zNa.0/ D zNa
0. The variables zI, v˛ are determined
algebraically through zNa, so they have no independent temporal evolution.
Dirac Bracket The equations of motion (8.109) can be written in a compact form

if we introduce the Dirac bracket constructed with help of the set of second-class
constraints ˆI

This possesses all the properties of the Poisson bracket, see Eqs. (2.47), (2.48), (2.49)
and (2.50). Besides, the remarkable property is that the Dirac bracket of the

in particular
fˆI; ˆJgD D 0:
(8.115)
This implies, in particular, that second-class constraints can be taken into account
inside the Dirac bracket (that is, before computing the bracket).
This can be used to write the function hNa in Eq. (8.110) in terms of the Dirac
bracket. Indeed, let us write equations for zNa which are contained in (8.112),
PzNa D fzNa; H0gD. Using the constraints (8.111), zI can be substituted into H0 before
computing the Dirac bracket. In the result, the dynamical variables zNa obey the
equations
PzNa D fzNa; H0.zNa/gD;
where
H0.zNa/ D H0.zNa; zI.zNa//:

Canonical Quantization and Second-Class Constraints The quantum mechanics
of a classical system with non singular Lagrangian L.qA; PqB; t/ can be obtained
using the canonical quantization procedure. To achieve this, we rewrite the system
in the Hamiltonian formalism. The basic quantities now are the Poisson brackets
fqA; pBg D ıAB and the Hamiltonian H.qA; pB; t/. According to the canonical
quantization paradigm, we associate with the phase-space variables the operators9
9The operators Oq, Op are taken as hermitian, which guarantees that their eigenvalues are real
numbers. Since the commutator of Hermitian operators is an anti-Hermitian operator, the factor
i appears on the r.h.s. of Eq. (8.117).

(8.118)
For a theory with second-class constraints, the recipe (8.117) would not be consis-
tent. Indeed, since in classical theory ˆI D 0, one expects that the corresponding
operators vanish on physical state vectors, OˆI‰ph D 0. Quantizing the theory by
means of the Poisson bracket, we obtain . OˆI OˆJ  OˆJ OˆI/‰ph DMIJ ‰ph. The left-
hand side of this expression vanishes, but the right-hand side does not.
The problem is resolved by postulating commutators that resemble the Dirac
bracket instead of the Poisson one

(8.119)
Owing to Eq. (8.115), this is consistent with the condition OˆI‰ph D 0.
The Problem with Time-Dependent Second-Class Constraints The prescription
formulated above does not work in a theory with time-dependent second-class
constraints. Such a kind situation generally arises when we consider a constrained
system in external ﬁelds in the physical-time parametrization, see Sect. 9.7.3. To
simplify our discussion, consider a theory which involves only the primary time-
dependent second-class constraints
H D H0.z; t/ C ˚˛.z; t/v˛:
(8.120)
All true trajectories lie on the surface ˚˛.z; t/ D 0 which has his own prescribed
dynamics. This dynamics yield an additional contribution into equations of motion
for z. Indeed, from the preservation in time of the constraints we obtain
P˚ˇ D @t˚ˇ C f˚ˇ; H0g C f˚ˇ; ˚˛gv˛ D 0;

then
v˛ D f˚˛; ˚ˇg1f˚ˇ; H0g  f˚˛; ˚ˇg1@t˚ˇ:
(8.122)
As compared with the standard case, we have the extra term, fz; ˚˛gf˚˛; ˚ˇg1
@t˚ˇ, which takes into account dynamics of the constraint surface. Substitution of
this expression into (8.120) gives the Hamiltonian
H D H0  ˚˛f˚˛; ˚ˇg1f˚ˇ; H0g  ˚˛f˚˛; ˚ˇg1@t˚ˇ:
(8.123)
Equations of motion have the Hamiltonian form (with the Hamiltonian (8.123)) with
respect to Poisson bracket
Pz D fz; H0g  fz; ˚˛gf˚˛; ˚ˇg1f˚ˇ; H0g  fz; ˚˛gf˚˛; ˚ˇg1@t˚ˇ:
(8.124)
Let us rewrite them using the Dirac bracket
Pz D fz; H0gD  fz; ˚˛gf˚˛; ˚ˇg1@t˚ˇ:
(8.125)
Due to the last term, they do not form a generalized Hamiltonian system with respect
to the Dirac bracket. Without a Hamiltonian, we are not able to write the Schrödinger
equation.
To avoid this difﬁculty, we introduce the new variables
zw D z  ˚˛f˚˛; ˚ˇg1@t˚ˇ:
(8.126)
They coincide with z on the constraint surface, so we call them weak variables. We
rewrite (8.125) in the form
d
d .z  ˚˛f˚˛; ˚ˇg1@t˚ˇ/ D fz; H0.z/gD :
(8.127)
As the constraints can be used before computing of the Dirac bracket, Eq. (8.127)
can be rewritten in closed form for zw
Pzw D fzw; H0.zw/gD ;
(8.128)
and represents the Hamiltonian system for zw. So, the weak variables admit the
standard canonical quantization: we could search for the operators Ozw with the
Dirac-bracket commutators, and then to impose the Schrödinger equation i„@t D
H.Ozw/. To compute mean values of the initial operators z, we need to invert the

Formal Quantum Realization of the Dirac Bracket Quantum realization of the

OqA D qA;

(8.129)
This implies ŒOqA; OpB D i„ıAB, as should be the case. To ﬁnd the quantum realization
for the Dirac bracket, we explore the weak variables introduced above. Let us
associate the function Aw with a phase-space function A.q; p/ as follows:
Aw.q; p/ D A.q; p/  fA; ˆIg QMIJˆJ:
(8.130)
On the constraint surface ˆI D 0 they coincide: Aw D A. Note that the Poisson
bracket of w-functions on the constraint surface coincides with the Dirac bracket of
the initial functions
fAw; BwgP D fA; BgD:
(8.131)
Since the quantum realization of the Poisson bracket is known, we can now realize
the Dirac bracket, associating the following operators10 with the classical quantities
A.q; p/
A.q; p/ ! OAw D Aw.q; p/jq!Oq;p!Op
(8.132)
with Oq, Op speciﬁed in Eq. (8.129). Commutators of these operators resemble the
Dirac bracket.
In particular, operators corresponding to the phase-space variables are
qA ! OqA
w D OqA  Œ OqA; ˆI QMIJˆJ;
pA ! OpwA D OpA  Œ OpA; ˆI QMIJˆJ;
(8.133)
Note also that in this realization the constraints become null operators:
ˆI ! OˆwI D 0.

case.

Here we obtain a further relationship between the Shrödingerand the scalar potential
equations, following the work [40]. We show that there is a Lagrangian theory
subject to second-class constraints underlying both the Schrödinger equation and
the classical ﬁeld theory (8.146). This possibility is based on the fact that in a theory
with second-class constraints, we can take different subsets as the independent
variables when we look for a solution of the constraints. For the model presented
below, there are two natural possibilities to choose the independentvariables. By one
option, they obey the Hamiltonian equations which correspond to the theory (8.147).
By the other option we reach the Schrödinger system (2.133) and (2.134).

These expressions, although determining a straight line, does not specify a particular
evolution law along the line. Nevertheless, the new functional can be used to
describe dynamics the system (8.158). Excluding  from the parametric equa-
tions (8.160), we obtain evolution of the physical variables, x.t/ D vt C x0.
Moreover, we can use reparametrization-invariance of the formalism to set  D t
at any instance of calculation, this should reproduce the corresponding result of
original formulation. For instance, setting  D t in (8.159) we obtain (8.158).
Any classical-mechanics system can be reformulated in the reparametrization -
invariant form, see Exercise 1 on page 307.
Dynamical and Non Dynamical Variational Problems Mathematically, the vari-
ational problems (8.158) and (8.159) are not equivalent. Nevertheless, we have seen
that the second problem can be used to describe dynamics of the original system. In
this relation, the following terminology seems to be convenient.
Parameterized line in Rn is a map of an interval of R into Rn,  W  ! q./.
Image of the map (that is the set of points in Rn) is called a line. So the parameterized
line is a line together with some ﬁxed parametrization along it. Consider the
variational problem S D
R
dL.q; Pq/ with given boundary conditions (we ﬁx initial
and ﬁnal points, q0 and q1). Variational problem is called dynamical if its solution
is a parameterized line. Variational problem is called non dynamical if its solution
is a line.
The functionals (8.159) and (6.115) represent examples of a non dynamical
variational problem. Another important example is the Einstein-Hilbert action
which yields Einstein equations of gravitational ﬁeld.
The problem (8.159) is deﬁned on conﬁguration space with the coordinates xi; t.
So in the Hamiltonian formulation we introduce the phase space parameterized by
xi, pi, t, pt with the Poisson brackets
fxi; p jg D ıij;
ft; ptg D 1:

These equations imply the primary constraint

2mp2 C U D 0;
(8.163)
which is satisﬁed for any solution to equations of motion. The constraint can be
written as pt D H, where H is the physical Hamiltonian of original formulation.
For this reason, energy is often called conjugated momentum for the time variable.
Since H0 D piPxi C ptPt  L D 0 (see also Exercise 2 on page 307), the complete
Hamiltonian is composed from the constraint
QH D v.pt C 1

(8.164)

Equations of motion Px D v
mp, Pp D v @U

due to the presence of v./, so all the variables are non observable quantities.
The last equation is a consequence of the constraint (8.163) and can be omitted.
For the free particle the second equation implies p D const. Then from the ﬁrst
equation x D pf./ C x0, where f./ D R vd. By the way, we have demonstrated
that (8.160) is a general solution of the problem (8.159). The reparametrization-

Schrödinger Equation To quantize the system (8.159), we replace the phase-space
variables by operators that resemble the brackets (8.161)
t ! Ot D t;
pt ! Opt D i„@t;
xi ! Oxi D xi; pi ! Opi D i„@i:
(8.165)
Since the constraint ˚ vanishes in classical theory, we expect that the corresponding
quantum-mechanical operator annihilates the wave function, O˚ D 0. This yields
the Schrödinger equation
i„@t D . „2
2m4 C V/:
(8.166)
In summary, in the reparametrization-invariant formulation of classical mechanics
there is no necessity to introduce the Schrödinger equation as one of independent
postulates of canonical quantization. This arises automatically, as the quantum
counterpart of the constraint (8.163).

independent potential the Hamiltonian does not change with time.
Due to presence of A0, the Hamiltonian (as well as the difference H.x/  H.y/
at two points) is not a gauge-invariant quantity. Hence classical Hamiltonian of
a particle interacting with electromagnetic ﬁeld does not represent an energy.
Surprisingly enough, eigenvalues of the corresponding quantum operator turn out
to be gauge-invariant quantities, see Sect. 10.2 in [50].

respect to P, this gives (8.174), and substitute the result into (8.182). This yields the
Lagrangian equations (8.168).
Hamiltonian and Energy Consider the stationary electromagnetic ﬁeld. The
Hamiltonian (8.179) is not a gauge-invariant quantity. In particular, generally it does
not represent the energy (8.170). We could also start with the variational problem
based on the three-vector potential, it is enough to set A0 D 0 in Eq. (8.167). In this
case the three-potential (1.269), and hence the Hamiltonian H D c
q
.mc/2 C P2
explicitly depend on time. As before, H does not coincide with E.
Nevertheless, the gauge invariance can be used to choose a particular A	 that
provides the coincidence of H with E. Indeed, in the stationary case the electric
ﬁeld has a potential, Ei D  1
e@iU (see Eq. (1.268)), so we can ﬁnd a stationary
potential of the form A	.x/ D . 1

and the Hamiltonian can be used to compute total energy of the particle.
2. Square-Root Lagrangian The Lorentz transformations act on the dynamical
variables xi.t/ in a highly nonlinear way. So the relativistic invariance of previous
formulation is not manifest. To improve this, we proceed in the same way as in

to use any parametrization to analyze the system (8.190). Taking  D t, the
equations coincide with (8.168). Note also that in physical-time parametrization
equation (8.189) coincides with (8.169).
The free Lagrangian equations and the ambiguity presented in the solutions have
been discussed in Sect. 1.7.6.
Hamiltonian Formulation As before, the equations for conjugate momenta p	 D

P	 D mc

where
P	 D p	  e

(8.191)
Due to (8.185) we have P0 > 0. Taking square of (8.191) we obtain the primary
constraint
P2 C .mc/2 D 0;
(8.192)
or, equivalently
 cp0 D c
q
.mc/2 C P2  eA0:
(8.193)
The right-hand side of this expression coincides with the physical Hamilto-
nian (8.179). Recall that in accordance with general theory, in the Lagrangian
formulation there is no ﬁrst-order equation that could be associated with the primary
constraint (8.192).
The Eq. (8.191) imply pPx  PPx C e

This has the same local symmetries as (8.186). To compare the Hamiltonian and
the Lagrangian equations, we exclude v and P	 from the system (8.192), (8.196)
and (8.197). First, we take the square of (8.196), Px2 D v2P2. Together with (8.192)
this determines v, v

mc . We substitute this into (8.196) and (8.197).
Then (8.192) is a consequence of (8.196) and can be omitted. Second, we substitute
P	 obtained from (8.196) into (8.197), this gives the Lagrangian equations (8.187).
The Role of v In the system (8.192) and (8.196) the equation PP0 D v e
cF0iPi is
a consequence of other equations and can be omitted. We have 8 equations for
9 variables x	, P	 and v. Given function v./, we have the normal system for
determining x	 and p	. Hence v./ is not determined by these equations. As a
consequence, dynamics of x	 and p	 turns out to be ambiguous. As v./ enters into
the equations for x	 and p	, their general solution contains, besides the arbitrary
integration constants, the arbitrary function v./
x	 D x	.; x

0; v.//;
p	 D p	.; x

(8.199)
Hence x	 and p	 have a one-parameter ambiguity due to v./. The variable v is the
“measure” of ambiguity presented in the formulation.
Physical variables obeys unambiguous equations. To obtain them, we note that
Eq. (8.196 ) imply the equalities without v, Pxi

Equivalently, we can use reparamatrization invariance to set  D t. Then the ﬁrst
equation from (8.196) is c D vP0. We use this together with (8.193) to exclude v

previous formulations we use reparametrization-invariance to set  D t (we thus
loose reparametrization invariance and manifest Lorentz-invariance)

The resulting equation coincides with (8.187). Hence the formulation (8.210) can

Note, however, that the present problem involves the extra-variable g which
requires an interpretation. Strange as it may seen, g./ play the same role as v./
appeared in (8.199), that is g./ responsable for an ambiguity presented in solutions.
Due to the reparametrizations, the ambiguity is expected. This is expected also from

Local Symmetries and Constraints
As we have seen in various examples, inﬁnitesimal local symmetries of a Lagrangian
action and ﬁrst-class constraints of the corresponding Hamiltonian formulation
represent characteristic properties of a degenerate theory. After the successful use
of local symmetry in the construction of Yang-Mills gauge theory, it becomes a
tradition to study ambiguities of constrained theories in terms of the associated
symmetries. So it would be interesting to establish a detailed relationship between
symmetries and constraints for a general degenerate action. It is instructive to
demonstrate the relation on a simple example. Consider a relativistic particle with
the Lagrangian L D
p
.Px	/2. This implies the Hamiltonian constraint T 
1
2.p2 C 1/, as well as the local symmetry14 of the Lagrangian action, ıx	 D 
Px	
p
Px2 .
This can be rewritten as follows
ıx	 D fx	; Tgjp	! @L
@Px	 :
(8.233)
So the local symmetry can be constructed with the help of the constraint, and
represents the Lagrangian counterpart of the canonical transformation generated by
the constraint on the phase space. It would be interesting to ﬁnd an appropriate
generalization of this recipe for obtaining local symmetry in general case. Since
the Hamiltonian constraints can be found in the course of the Dirac procedure, this
would give a regular method for obtaining the symmetries.
The general form of inﬁnitesimal local symmetry is
ıqB D aR.0/a
B C PaR.1/a
B C RaR.2/a
B C : : : C

 -type symmetry. P-type symmetry is called
gauge symmetry. The set of functions R.k/aB.q; Pq; : : :/ is called the generator of the
symmetry.
14After rescaling the parameter,  D 
p
Px20, it acquires the standard form of a reparametriza-
tion.

Hamiltonian Formalism for Singular Theories
In the next section we suppose that an inﬁnitesimal symmetry is known, and
discuss the restrictions that this fact implies on the Hamiltonian formulation of
a theory (for a more general theory of local symmetries, see [43, 44]). Then we
develop the so-called formalism of extended Lagrangian, which allows us to analyze
the inverse task: how the local symmetries can be reconstructed from the known
system of constraints. At the end, we obtain the generalization (8.307), (8.308)
of Eq. (8.233) to the case of an arbitrary singular degenerate theory in extended
formalism.
8.8.1
Symmetries of Lagrangian and Hamiltonian
Formulations
Analysis of the general case (8.234) implies rather tedious algebraic manipulations,
see [45]. So we restrict ourselves to the simplest case of P-type symmetry. This is
sufﬁcient to illustrate all the afﬁrmations that remain true for the general case as
well. For the convenience of the reader, we ﬁrst summarize the afﬁrmations.
Consider inﬁnitesimal local transformations with at most one derivative acting
on the parameters a./
ıqA D aR0aA.q; Pq/ C PaR1aA.q; Pq/;
(8.235)
and suppose that an action is invariant
ıS D

(8.236)
where !0a; !1a are some functions. Then
1. The quantities R1aA represent null-vectors of the Hessian matrix
R1aAMAB  0;
(8.237)
that is we are dealing with a singular theory.
2. There are the following identities among equations of motion

3. As any other Lagrangian quantity, the identities can be rewritten in terms of the
coordinates qA; pB; v˛ of the extended phase space. The result is the following
system

(8.240)
R0a˛fˆ˛; Hg  fR1a˛fˆ˛; Hg; Hg  0:
(8.241)
The equations have a simple meaning. Equation (8.239) states that in arbitrary
theory not all the generators are independent: the i-generators R0ai, R1ai are
expressed through the ˛-generators.
Remember that fˆ˛; Hg D 0 is the second-stage algebraic system of the
Dirac procedure, see Eq. (8.42). So, Eq. (8.240) states that the combinations
Ta  R1a˛fˆ˛; Hg do not depend on v˛ and thus represent [a] second-stage
constraints.
Equation (8.241) involves the Poisson bracket of these constraints with H, so
the resulting quantity fTa; Hg is a part of the third-stage algebraic system of the
Dirac procedure. Hence Eq. (8.241) states that this part of the third-stage system
coincides with the combinations R0a˛fˆ˛; Hg of the second-stage system. That
is, the constraints Ta do not produce new constraints or equations for determining
the velocities.
4. The symmetry transformations (8.235) can be used to construct local symmetry
of the ﬁrst-order action (2.158)

Hamiltonian Formalism for Singular Theories
Hence the inﬁnitesimal Lagrangian symmetry, rewritten in the Hamiltonian form,
represents, in the sector qA; pA, a canonical transformation with the generator G
constructed from the primary ˆ˛ and the secondary Ta constraints.
Analogous afﬁrmations hold for the general case (8.234) as well. In particular,
.N1/
 -type symmetry implies the appearance of constraints at the N-th stage of the
Dirac procedure.
In the rest of this section we demonstrate the afﬁrmations made above.

combining these terms and using Eqs. (8.240) and (8.241) we have ıSH D div.
To ﬁnd the ﬁnal form of the symmetry, we identically rewrite the transformations

NıpA D fpA; ıq˛gˆ˛;
Nıv˛ D .ıq˛/ C fH; ıq˛g:
represent a trivial symmetry of the Hamiltonian action, and thus can be omitted. The
remaining part is precisely Eq. (8.243).

8.8.2
Local Symmetry Does Not Imply a Conserved Charge
Since in the expression for local symmetry (8.235) the parameters  are arbitrary
functions, we can take  D const. So, local symmetry implies global symmetry.
Let us construct the corresponding Noether charge. When  D const, the invariance
condition (8.236), instead of Eqs. (8.245), (8.246) and (8.247) implies only one of
them, Eq. (8.247). The latter can be identically rewritten as follows
 @L
@PqA R0aA  !0a
:
D ıS
ıqA R0aA;
(8.272)
So the Noether charge is
Qa D @L
@PqA R0aA  !0a;
(8.273)
At the same time, in our theory there is the identity (8.248). Using this in the
previous expression, we obtain
Qa D  ıS
ıqA R1aA:
(8.274)
Hence a Noether charge of a local symmetry vanishes on equations of motion and
thus cannot be used to characterize physical states. The same is true for gauge ﬁeld
theories.
8.8.3
Formalism of Extended Lagrangian
To continue the analysis of local symmetries in a singular theory, we associate
with the initial Lagrangian (8.29) the so-called extended Lagrangian [46]. This is
formulated on the extended conﬁguration space .qA; sa/, where sa stand for auxiliary
variables associated with all the higher-stage constraints ˆa. One of the advantages
of the extended formalism is that the Dirac procedure, being applied to the extended
Lagrangian, always stops at the third stage. Hamiltonian equations of the extended
formulation have a more symmetric form, which essentially simpliﬁes the analysis
of their structure. Here we construct the extended Lagrangian formulation and
demonstrate its equivalence with the initial one. Local symmetries will be discussed
in the next two sections.

The second line in (8.277) disappears when the higher-stage constraints are

Let us discuss some properties of the extended Lagrangian.
First, we conﬁrm that Eq. (8.276) can be resolved with respect to ! in the
vicinity of the point sa D 0. Indeed, when sa D 0, this equation coincides with
Eq. (8.32) of the initial formulation, which can be resolved, see (8.31). Hence

That is, Qpi is precisely the solution to our basic Eq. (8.276). Taking this into account,
the system (8.287) and (8.288) is equivalent to the following one

So, in the extended formulation the primary constraints (8.33) of the initial
formulation are present. Besides, there are the trivial constraints (8.291) in a number
equal to the number of all the higher-stage constraints of the initial formulation.
Using the deﬁnition (8.36), we obtain the Hamiltonian
QH0 D H0 C saˆa;
(8.292)
where H0 is precisely the Hamiltonian of the initial formulation. Then the complete
Hamiltonian for QL reads
QH D H0.qA; Qpj/ C saˆa.qA; Qpj/ C v˛ˆ˛.qA; QpB/ C vaa:
(8.293)
It is also called the extended Hamiltonian for L.
This expression, together with the results of Sect. 1.6.3, allows to conﬁrm an
equivalence of original and extended formulations. Indeed, consider the Hamilto-
nian variational problem for the extended dynamics

as the variational problem SH D
R
d QpAPqA  ŒH0 C v˛ˆ˛ with the kinematic
constraints ˆa D 0. But this is just our original problem.
By the way, Eq. (8.295) shows that in a singular theory, all the higher-stage
constraints (multiplied by their own Lagrangian multipliers sa) can be added to the
complete Hamiltonian H0 C v˛ˆ˛.
Let us continue our analysis of the extended formulation. Due to the very
special structure of the Hamiltonian, Eq. (8.292), preservation in time of the primary
constraints a, Pa D fa; H0 C saˆag D ˆa D 0 implies the equations ˆa D 0.
Hence all the higher-stage constraints of the initial formulation appeared as second-
stage constraints of the extended theory.

Preservation in time of the primary constraints ˆ˛ leads to the equations
fˆ˛; QHg D fˆ˛; H0g C fˆ˛; ˆˇgvˇ C fˆ˛; ˆbgsb D 0. In turn, preservation
of the secondary constraints ˆa leads to the equations fˆa; QHg D fˆa; H0g C
fˆa; ˆˇgvˇ C fˆa; ˆbgsb D 0. To continue the analysis, it is convenient to unify
them as follows:
fˆI; H0g C fˆI; ˆJgSJ D 0:
(8.296)
Here ˆI are all the constraints of the initial formulation, and SJ  .v˛; sa/. Using
the matrix (8.93), the system (8.296) can be rewritten in the equivalent form
˚ QˆI1; H0

C O.ˆI/ D 0;
(8.297)
˚ QˆI2; H0

C f QˆI2; ˆJgSJ D O.ˆI/:
(8.298)
Equation (8.297) does not contain any new information, since the ﬁrst class
constraints commute with the Hamiltonian, see Eq. (8.96). Let us analyze the
system (8.298). First, note that due to the rank condition rankf QˆI2; ˆJg
ˇˇ
ˆI
D
ŒI2 D max, exactly ŒI2 variables among SI can be determined from the system.
According to the Dirac prescription, we need to determine the maximal number
of the multipliers v˛. To do this, let us restore v-dependence in Eq.(8.298):
f QˆI2; ˆ˛gv˛ C f QˆI2; H0g C f QˆI2; ˆbgsb D 0. Since the matrix f QˆI2; ˆ˛g is the same
as in the initial formulation, from these equations we determine a group of variables
v˛2 through the remaining variables v˛1, where Œ˛2 is the number of second-class
constraints among ˆ˛. After substitution of the result into the remaining equations
of the system (8.298), this acquires the form
v˛2 D v˛2.q; Qp; sa; v˛1/;
Qa2b.q; Qp/sb C Pa2.q; Qp/ D 0;
(8.299)
where Œa2 is the number of higher-stage second-class constraints of the initial
theory. It must be P  0, since when sb D 0, the system (8.298) is a subsystem of
fˆI; Hg D 0, but the latter vanishes after substitution of the multipliers determined
during the procedure; see the discussion after Eq. (8.48). Besides, note that rank
Q D Œa2 D max. Indeed, suppose that rank Q D Œa0 < Œa2. Then from Eq. (8.298)
only Œ˛2 C Œa0 < ŒI2 variables among SI can be determined, contradicting the
conclusion reached before. In short, the system (8.296) for determining the second-
stage and third-stage constraints and multipliers is equivalent to

Note that each solution of the extended theory with sa D 0 represents a solution
of the original theory as well.
8.8.4
Local Symmetries of the Extended Lagrangian: Dirac
Conjecture
Here we discuss one of advantages of the extended Lagrangian action: there is a
closed formula for its local symmetries in terms of constraints.
According to the analysis carried out in the previous section, the primary
constraints of the extended formulation are ˆ˛ D 0, a D 0. Among ˆ˛ D 0
ﬁrst-class constraints are present, in a number equal to the number of primary ﬁrst-
class constraints of L. Among a D 0, we have found the ﬁrst-class constraints
a1  a2Qa2 a1.q; p/ D 0, in a number equal to the number of all the higher-stage
ﬁrst-class constraints of L. Thus the number of primary ﬁrst-class constraints of QL
coincides with the number ŒI1 of all the ﬁrst-class constraints of L. We obtain now
exact formula for ŒI1 local symmetries of the extended formulation QL.

Here I1./, I1 D 1; 2; : : : ; ŒI1, are the local parameters, and K is the conversion
matrix, see Eq. (8.93). Note that Eq. (8.307) represents an inﬁnitesimal canonical
transformation, with the generators being the ﬁrst-class constraints of initial for-
mulation. We point out that these formulas represent a direct generalization of our
illustrative example, see Eq. (8.233).
According to Eq. (8.308) the variation of some sa involves the derivative of
parameters. Hence they can be identiﬁed with gauge ﬁelds for the symmetry. At
this point, it is instructive to discuss what happens with local symmetries when
we pass from L to QL. As we have seen in Sect. 8.8,
.N1/
 -type symmetry implies
N-th stage constraints in the Hamiltonian formulation for L. Replacing L with QL,
we arrive at the formulation with at most second-stage ﬁrst-class constraints and
the corresponding P-type symmetries (8.307). That is each symmetry (8.234) of L
“decomposes” into N gauge symmetries of QL.
We now show that the variation of QL under the transformation (8.307) is
proportional to the higher-stage constraints Ta. So, it can be cancelled by appropriate
variation of sa, which is given by Eq.(8.308). In the subsequent computations
we omit all the total derivatives. Besides, the notation Aj implies the substitution
indicated in Eqs. (8.307) and (8.308).
To give a proof, it is convenient to represent the extended Lagrangian (8.277)
in terms of the initial Hamiltonian H0, instead of the initial Lagrangian L. Using
Eq. (8.70) we write
QL.qA; PqA; sa/ D!iPqi C f˛.qA; !j/Pq˛
 H0.qA; !j/  saTa.qA; !j/;
(8.309)
where the functions !i.q; Pq; s/, f˛.q; !/ are deﬁned by Eqs. (8.275), (8.34). Accord-
ing to the identity (8.283), the variation of QL with respect to !i does not give
any contribution. Taking this into account, the variation of Eq. (8.309) under the
transformation (8.307) can be written in the form

Hamiltonian Formalism for Singular Theories
Dirac Conjecture Consider a theory which involves only ﬁrst-class constraints.
This implies that in the total Hamiltonian, H D H0Cv˛ˆ˛, all the velocities remain
undetermined. According to Sect. 2.3 the solution to the Hamiltonian equations, in
linear order with respect to ı, is
z.ı/ D z.0/ C ıfz; H0g C ıv˛fz; ˆ˛g;
(8.320)
and depends on the arbitrary functions v˛. According to Sect. 8.4, solutions which
correspond to different choices of v, z1.ı; v1/ and z2.ı; v2/, are equivalent, and
describe the same physical state.
Dirac observed that, according to (8.320), the solutions z1 and z2 are related
by canonical transformation with the generators being ﬁrst-class constraints: ız D
˛fz; ˆ˛g, ˛ D ı4v˛. The Dirac conjecture is that the higher-state constraints
also generate transformations that do not change physical states.
We point out that (8.307) can be considered as a proof of the Dirac conjecture for-
mulated as follows: all ﬁrst-class constraints of an initial Lagrangian are generators
of local symmetry of the extended Lagrangian.
8.8.5
Local Symmetries of the Initial Lagrangian
When only ﬁrst-class constraints are present in the formulation, symmetries of the
extended Lagrangian can be used to restore those of the initial Lagrangian. In the

In the presence of second-class constraints, local symmetries of L can not

the number of equations of the system (8.323) can be equal to or greater than the

Conversion of Second-Class Constraints by Deformation
of Lagrangian Local Symmetries
In this section we discuss invertible changes on the space of functions which
have the following form q./ ! f. Qq./; PQq./; : : :/. Owing to the invertibility
(and under certain conditions that will be discussed below), changes of this kind
lead to an equivalent Lagrangian. To understand their meaning, suppose that q
enters into the initial Lagrangian without derivatives, which implies the primary
constraint p D 0 in the Hamiltonian formulation. The transformed Lagrangian L0
will contain derivatives of the new variable Qq, so the constraint generally does not
appear in the formulation L0. As will be seen, in many cases a pair of second-class
constraints of the initial Lagrangian is replaced by a ﬁrst-class constraint in the
transformed formulation. That is, the notion of ﬁrst- and second-class constraints is
not “invariant” under such a change. In this section we follow the work [48].
To illustrate how this works, we analyze the following dynamically trivial model
deﬁned on conﬁguration space x./; y./; z./, with the Lagrangian action being
S D

This is invariant under the ﬁnite local symmetry with the parameter ˛./
ıx D ˛;

ız D 0:
(8.345)
So we have a formulation with P˛-type symmetry. Moving on to Hamiltonian
formalism, we obtain the following chains of constraints:
Primary
Secondary
First-class chain
py D 0;
px D 0;
(8.346)
Second-class chain

(8.348)
and has R˛-type symmetry
ıx D ˛;
ıy D P˛;
ı Qz D  R˛:
(8.349)
As we know, this implies the appearance of a constraint at the third stage of the Dirac
procedure. In the new formulation, this replaces the second-class chain (8.347).

8.8
Local Symmetries and Constraints
343
Computing the constraints of the formulation (8.348), we ﬁnd the following ﬁrst-
class chain
Primary
Second-stage
Third-stage
pQz D 0;
py D 0;
px D 0:
(8.350)
The reader can verify that the initial formulation is a gauge of the new one (it
corresponds to the gauge pQz D 0/. Hence, using the change, two second-class
constraints (8.347) have been replaced on the ﬁrst-class constraint Qz D 0. In the
formulation S0 only the ﬁrst-class constraints are present. The procedure is called a
conversion of second-class constraints. In the language of symmetries, the change
raises the order of a symmetry, leading to deformation of the constraints structure.
Let us describe the conversion trick in further detail. Let L.qA; PqA/ be the
Lagrangian of a theory with ﬁrst- and second-class constraints. In the Lagrangian
formulation, the ﬁrst-class constraints manifest themselves in invariance of the
action under some local symmetry transformations. Let
ıqA D
.k/ RA.q; Pq/ C : : : ;
(8.351)
be an inﬁnitesimal form of one of the symmetries. The dots stand for all terms
with less then k-derivatives acting on a parameter. As we know,
.k/ -type symmetry
generally implies the appearance of some constraint at the .kC1/-stage of the Dirac
procedure.
Let us divide coordinates qA into two groups: qA D .qi;
q˛/. We change
the parametrization of the conﬁguration space: qA
!
QqA according to the
transformation which involves derivatives of q˛
qi D qi. QqA; PQq˛/;
q˛ D q˛. Qqˇ/:
(8.352)
We suppose that the transformation is invertible in the following sense
det@qi
@ Qqj ¤ 0;
det@q˛
@ Qqˇ ¤ 0:
(8.353)
This implies that QqA can be determined from (8.352): Qqi D Qqi.qA; Pq˛/, Qq˛ D Qq˛.qˇ/.
So, our theory can be equally analyzed in terms of the Lagrangian L0  L.q. Qq/; Pq. Qq/.
We further suppose that the transformation (8.352) has been chosen in such a way
that QL does not involve higher derivatives, disregarding the total-derivative terms
(we show below that this is possible in a singular theory)

Hamiltonian Formalism for Singular Theories
Let us see what we can say about the structure of Hamiltonian constraints of our
theory in the new parametrization QL, as compared with L. We note that the local
symmetry for the set Qq is generally of
.kC1/
 -type: ı Qqi D
.kC1/

@ Qqi
@Pq˛ QR˛. QqA; PQqA; RQq˛/ C
: : :. Since the order of the symmetry has been raised by one unit, at the .kC2/-stage
of the Dirac procedure an extra constraint appears. On the other hand, the physical
sector of QL is the same as for L. If the order of other symmetries (if any) was not
lowered, the only possibility17 is that the extra .k C 2/-stage constraint is ﬁrst-class,
and it replaces a pair of second-class constraints of the initial formulation. In short,
an appropriate parametrization (8.352), (8.353) and (8.354) of the conﬁguration
space implies a deformation of local symmetries which, in turn, can result in the
conversion of second-class constraints. Clearly, Eqs. (8.353) and (8.354) represent
only necessary conditions for the conversion.
Note that we can consider more general transformations: qi D qi. QqA; PQq˛; RQq˛; : : : ;
.s/
Qq˛/; q˛ D q˛. Qqˇ/, which involve higher derivatives of Qq˛. These generally increase
the order of symmetry by s units, and 2s second-class constraints can be converted.
For an example of this kind, see [48].
As the example discussed earlier shows, the condition (8.354) can be easily
satisﬁed if some variable enters into the action without a derivative. In this
respect, let us point out that for a singular theory L.q; Pq/, there is an equivalent
formulation, L0.q0; Pq0/, with the desired property. Actually, starting from the singular
L, we construct the Hamiltonian H D H0.qA; pj/ C v˛ˆ˛, where ˆ˛.qA; pB/ D
p˛  f˛.qA; pj/ are primary constraints. As we know, the functions H0; f˛ do not
depend on p˛. We further separate a phase-space pair which corresponds to some
ﬁxed ˛, for example ˛ D 1: ˛ D .1; ˛0/, .qA; pA/ D .q1; p1; z/. According to
Sect. 4.4.3, there is a canonical transformation .q1; p1; z/ ! .q01; p0
1; z0/, such that
the Hamiltonian acquires the form H0 D H0
0.q01; z0/Cv1p0
1Cv˛0ˆ˛0.q01; z0/. We can
restore the Lagrangian L0.q0; Pq0/ which reproduces H0 in Hamiltonian formalism. By
construction, L0 does not depend on Pq01.
We ﬁnish this section with three examples of application of the conversion trick.
8.8.6.1
Conversion in a Theory with Hidden SO.1; 4/ Global Symmetry
In this example, the initial formulation implies a non-linear realization of a global
symmetry, therefore is not convenient. The conversion reveals this hidden symmetry
that is present in the theory. Besides, the extra gauge freedom of the converted
version is used to ﬁnd a parametrization which linearizes equations of motion.
17Here the condition (8.354) is important. A theory with higher derivatives, being equivalent to
the initial one, has more degrees of freedom than the number of variables qA, see Sect. 2.10. So
the extra constraints would be responsible for ruling out these hidden degrees of freedom. Our
condition (8.354) precludes the appearance of the hidden degrees of freedom.

Hamiltonian Formalism for Singular Theories
To convert a pair of second-class constraints (8.359) we need to raise the order of
symmetry (8.356) by one unit. From Eq.(8.356) we note that this can be achieved
by performing a shift of a variable on Pe. Since the variable g enters into the action
without a derivative, a shift of the type g D Qg C Pe does not lead to higher-derivative
terms in the action and thus realizes the conversion. It is convenient to accompany
the shift by an appropriate change of variables. Namely, let us make the invertible
transformation .x	; e; g/ ! . QxA D . Qx	; Qx4/; Qg/, where
Qx	 D e 1

The resulting action has a manifest SO.1; 4/ global symmetry. The conserved
current P	 then corresponds to the symmetry under rotations in . Qx	; Qx4/-planes. The
local symmetry of the action (8.364) can be obtained from Eqs. (8.356) and (8.363),
and is of R˛-type

(8.366)
and the ﬁrst-class constraints
QpQg D 0;
QxA QpA C a D 0;
QpA QpA D 0;
(8.367)
Thus S0 represents the converted version of the action (8.355). Let us write equations
of motion for the xA-sector
PQxA D QpA C Qg QxA;
PQpA D  Qg QpA:
(8.368)
In the gauge Qg D Qx	 Qp	 C a; Qp4 D Qx	 Qp	 C a for the theory (8.364) we reproduce
the initial dynamics (8.360) (taken in the gauge e D 1/. Going over to the gauge
Qg D 0;
Qp4 D a, we obtain the free Eq.(8.362). Hence the extra gauge freedom,
resulting from the conversion of second-class constraints, can be used to search for
the parametrization which implies the linear equations of motion.

8.8.6.2
Classical Mechanics Subject to Kinematic Constraints as a Gauge
Theory
The conversion trick can be carried out in a theory which involves only second-class
constraints, that is in a theory without local symmetries in the initial formulation.
To begin with, we note that a given theory without local symmetry can be treated
as a gauge theory on appropriately extended conﬁguration space. For instance, a
theory with the action S.qA/ can be equally considered as a theory on the space
qA; a, where a is one more conﬁguration-space variable, with local transformations
deﬁned by q0A D qA, a0 D a C ˛. Since a does not enter into the action, the latter is
invariant under local transformations!18 This trivial gauge symmetry of the extended
formulation can be further used for conversion of second-class constraints according
to our procedure.19
Let us see how this works on an example of classical mechanics with kinematic
constraints. In Sect. 8.6 we discussed this as a theory with the action
S D

i  QMijfFj; H0g D 0:
(8.370)
Now we present it as a locally-invariant theory which involves only ﬁrst-class
constraints.
Conversion can be carried out by making the following transformation in the
action (8.369)
i D i C Rei;
(8.371)

(8.372)
18This is a general situation: given a locally-invariant action, there are special coordinates such that
the action does not depend on some of them [10].
19There are other possibilities for creating trivial local symmetries. For example, in a given
Lagrangian action with one of the variables being q, let us make the substitution q D ab, where
a, b represent new conﬁguration space variables. The resulting action is equivalent to the initial
one, an auxiliary character of one of the new degrees of freedom is guaranteed by the trivial gauge
symmetry: a ! a0 D ˛a; b ! b0 D ˛1b. Another simple possibility is to write q D a C b,
which implies the symmetry a ! a0 D a C ˛; b ! b0 D b  ˛. The well-known example of
this kind transformation is einbein formulation in gravity theory: g	
 D ea

, which implies local
Lorentz invariance.

does not contain higher-derivative terms and is invariant under the local transfor-
mations Qi ! Q
0i D Qi C R˛i; ei ! e0i D ei  ˛i. Due to this R˛-symmetry we
expect the appearance of 3[i] ﬁrst class constraints in the Hamiltonian formulation
for the theory (8.372). To conﬁrm this, let us write deﬁning equations for conjugate
momenta

p Qi D 0:
(8.373)
The last equation represents [i] primary constraints. The remaining equations can
be resolved with respect to the velocities Pqa; Pei, since the corresponding block of the
Hessian matrix is non-degenerate.It can easily be seen in special coordinates chosen
as follows. The initial coordinates qa can be reordered in such a way that the rank
minor of the matrix @Gi
@qa is placed on the right: qa D .q˛; qi/; det @Gi
@qj ¤ 0. Now, let
us make the invertible change of variables qa ! Qqa, where Qq˛ D q˛; Qqi D Gi.qa/.
In these variables our Lagrangian is
L0 D L0. Qq; PQq/  PeiPQqi C Qi Qqi:
(8.374)
From this expression we immediately ﬁnd the determinant of the Hessian matrix:
det
@2 QL
@2. Qq;e/ D det @2L0
@PQq˛@PQqˇ . It does not vanish since in classical mechanics the quadratic
form
@2L0
@PQqa@PQqb is positive deﬁned.
Let us return to the analysis of the action (8.372). The complete Hamiltonian is
H D paPqa C peiPei  L0.q; Pq/ C PeiGiaqa  QiGi.q/ C vi
Qp Qi;
(8.375)
where Pqa; Pei are solutions to Eq. (8.373). As before, the second-stage constraints
are Gi.q/ D 0. Their conservation in time can be easily computed by using of
Eq. (8.373): PGi D fGi; Hg D pei, which gives the third-stage constraints pei D 0.
Then the complete constraint system is composed by 3[i] ﬁrst class constraints
p Qi D 0;
Gi D 0;
pei D 0:
(8.376)
The ﬁrst-class constraints pei D 0 state that the variables ei are pure gauge degrees of
freedom, as was expected. They can be removed from the formulation if we choose
the gauge ei D 0. The remaining 2[i] ﬁrst-class constraints in Eq. (8.376) replace
4[i] second class-constraints (8.370) of the initial formulation.
As a particular example, we consider a particle on a 2-sphere of radius c, with

Classical and Quantum Relativistic Mechanics
of a Spinning Particle
Abstract Search for the relativistic equations that describe evolution of rotational
degrees of freedom and their inﬂuence on the trajectory of a spinning body, repre-
sents a problem with a long and fascinating history. Closely related problem consists
in establishing of classical equations that could mimic quantum mechanics of an
elementary particle with spin in a semiclassical approximation. The relationship
among classical and quantum descriptions has an important bearing, providing
interpretation of results of quantum-ﬁeld-theory computations in usual terms:
particles and their interactions. In this Chapter we develop the Lagrangian and
Hamiltonian formulations of a particle with rotational degrees of freedom. Taking
a variational problem as the starting point, we avoid the ambiguities and confusion,
otherwise arising in the passage from Lagrangian to Hamiltonian description
and vice-versa. Besides, it essentially ﬁxes the possible form of interaction with
external ﬁelds. We show that so called vector model of spin represents a uniﬁed
conceptual framework, allowing to collect and tie together a lot of remarkable ideas,
observations and results accumulated over almost a century of studying this subject.
On the classical level, the vector model adequately describes spinning particle in
an arbitrary gravitational and electromagnetic ﬁelds. Moreover, taking into account
the leading relativistic corrections it explains the famous one-half factor in non-
relativistic Hamiltonian. Canonical quantization of the model yields one-particle
relativistic quantum mechanics with positive-energy states.

Classical and Quantum Relativistic Mechanics of a Spinning Particle
that so called vector model of spin represents a uniﬁed conceptual framework,
allowing to collect and tie together a lot of remarkable ideas, observations and
results accumulated over almost a century of studying this subject. In the vector
model appear both ﬁrst and second class constraints, therefore it also represents a
non trivial application of the formalism described in Chap. 8.
We have not tried to establish a variational problem of the most general possible
form. Instead, the emphasis has been placed on the variational problem leading
to the equations which are widely considered the most promising candidates for
description of spinning particles in external ﬁelds. For the case of electromagnetic
ﬁeld, the vector model leads to generalization of the approximate equations of
Frenkel and Bargmann, Michel and Telegdi (BMT) to the case of an arbitrary ﬁeld.
Here the strong restriction on possible form of equations is that the reasonable model
should be in correspondence with the Dirac equation. In this regard the vector model
is of interest because it yields a relativistic quantum mechanics with positive-energy
states, and is closely related to the Dirac equation. Concerning the equations of a
rotating body in general relativity, the widely assumed candidates are the Mathisson-
Papapetrou-Tulczyjew-Dixon (MPTD) equations. We show that they correspond to
the minimal interaction of vector model with gravity and turn out to be problematic
in ultra-relativistic limit. Then we construct a non minimal interaction through
gravimagnetic moment and show that a body with unit gravimagnetic moment is
free from the problems detected in MPTD-equations.

Vector Model of Spinning Particle: Non Relativistic Spin
The data of some experiments with elementary particles and atoms (Stern–Gerlach
experiment, ﬁne structure of hydrogen atom, Zeeman effect) shows that the
Schrödinger equation for a one-componentwave function is not adequate to describe
the behavior of these systems in the presence of an electromagnetic ﬁeld. This
implies a radical modiﬁcation of the formalism, see, for example, the book [41] for
a detailed discussion. Roughly speaking, besides the position and the momentum,
the state of an electron is speciﬁed by some discrete numbers, which are eigenvalues
of suitably deﬁned operators, called the operators of spin. The mathematical theory
of these operators is similar to the formalism of angular momentum. So, intuitively,
an elementary particle carries an intrinsic angular momentum called spin.

Classical and Quantum Relativistic Mechanics of a Spinning Particle
The equation is written in the Schrödinger picture, that is we ascribe time-
dependence to the wave function, whereas in semiclassical models we deal with
dynamical variables. We recall that the time-dependence can be ascribed to oper-
ators using the Heisenberg picture. Passing to the Heisenberg picture, we could
write dynamical equations for basic operators of the theory. According to Ehrenfest
theorem, expectation values of the operators approximately obey the classical
Hamiltonian equations with the brackets discussed in Sect. 8.5.
The Eq. (9.9) gives the structure and properties of the energy levels of hydrogen
atom in a good agreement with experiment. The ﬁne structure of hydrogen atom
ﬁxes the factor g  1 in the third term, while Zeeman effect requires the factor g in
the last term.
To formulate the problem that we wish to discuss, we recall that quantum
mechanics of a spinless particle can be obtained applying the canonical quantization
procedure to a classical-mechanics system with the Lagrangian L D 1
2mx2U.x/. To
achieve this, we construct a Hamiltonian formulation for the system, then associate
with the phase-space variables the operators with commutators resembling the
Poisson brackets, and write on this base the Schrödinger equation i„ P‰ D OH‰.
It is natural to ask whether this ideology can be realized for the spinning particle.
Since the quantum-mechanical description of a spin implies the use of three extra
operators OSi, the problem can be formulated as follows. We look for a classical-
mechanics system which, besides the position variables xi, contains additional
degrees of freedom, suitable for the description of a spin: in the Hamiltonian
formulation the spin should be described, in the end, by three variables with ﬁxed
square (9.8) and with the classical brackets fSi; Sjg D ijkSk. Then canonical quan-
tization of these variables will yield spin operators with the desired properties (9.7)
and (9.8). According to this, typical spinning-particle model consist of a point on a
world-line and some set of variables describing the spin degrees of freedom, which
form an inner space attached to that point.2 In fact, different spinning particles
discussed in the literature differ by the choice of the inner space. An exceptional
case is the rigid particle [62] which consist of only position variables, but with
the action containing higher derivatives. The model yields the Dirac equation [63],
hence it also can be used for description of spin.
It should be noted that Eq. (9.9) is written in the laboratory system, so (contrary
to some other books), we do not state that our classical variable Si is a quantity
deﬁned in the instantaneous rest frame of the particle.
We intend to construct the spinning particle starting from a suitable variational
problem. This is the ﬁrst task we need to solve, as the formulation of a variational
problem in closed form is known only for the case of a phase space equipped with
canonical Poisson bracket, say f!i; jg D ıij. The number of variables and their
2There is an elegant formalism developed by Berezin and Marinov [42] based on using of
anticommuting (Grassmann) variables for the description of spin. We present here another
formulation based on commuting variables, without appealing to a rather formal methods of the
Grassmann mechanics.

algebra are different from the number of spin operators and their commutators, (9.7).
May be the most natural way to arrive at the operator algebra (9.7) is to consider
spin as a composite quantity,
Si D ijk!jk;
or
S D !  ;
(9.10)
where !;  are coordinates of a phase space equipped with canonical Poisson
bracket. This immediately induces SO.3/-algebra for Si, fSi.!; /; Sj.!; /gPB D
ijkSk. Unfortunately, this is not the whole story. First, we need some mechanism
which explains why S, not ! and  must be taken for the description of spin
degrees of freedom. Second, the basic space is six-dimensional, while the spin
manifold is two-dimensional (we remind that the square of spin operator has ﬁxed
value, Eq.(9.8)). To improve this, we look for a variational problem which, besides
dynamical equations, implies the constraints
! D 0;
2  ˛
!2 D 0;
where
˛ D 3„2
4 :
(9.11)
They form the ﬁrst-class set, so in the model with these constraints the spin sector
contains 6  2  2 D 2 physical degrees of freedom. Geometrically, the constraints
determine four-dimensional SO.3/-invariant surface of the six-dimensional phase
space. The constraints imply
S2 D !22  .!/2 D 3„2
4 :
(9.12)
The same square of spin follows from the constraints
!2 D ˛2;
2 D ˇ2;
! D 0;
(9.13)
if we put ˇ2 D 3„2
4˛2 , any ˛. The combination 2  ˇ2 C ˇ2
˛2 .!2  ˛2/ represents the
ﬁrst-class constraint of the set (9.13). Hence the model with these constraints also
has the desired number of degrees of freedom, 6212 D 2. The equalities (9.13)
determine essentially unique SO.3/-invariant three-dimensional surface of the phase
space. The set (9.11) turns out to be more convenient for generalization to the case
of a relativistic spin.
While S in (9.10) looks like an angular momentum, the crucial difference is due
to the presence of ﬁrst-class constraints, and hence of a local symmetry which we
refer as spin-plane symmetry. The latter acts on the basic variables !, , while
leaves invariant the spin variable S. Using analogy with classical electrodynamics, !
and  are similar to four-potential A	 while S plays the role of F	
. The coordinates
! of the “inner-space particle” are not physical (observable) quantities. The only
observable quantities are the gauge-invariant variables Si. So our construction
realizes, in a systematic form, the oldest idea about spin as the “hidden angular
momentum”.

class constraints (equivalently, the local symmetries) are presented in the model,
a part of variables have ambiguous evolution. This also can be translated into the
geometric language: due to the ambiguity, the submanifold should be endowed
with a natural structure of a ﬁber bundle. Physical variables are (functions of) the
coordinates which parameterize the base of the ﬁber bundle. Let us describe, how

Hamiltonian action.
9.1.2
An Example of Classical Mechanics Without Observable
Trajectories
It is instructive to discuss here the notion of pseudo-classical mechanics, the term
by which we refer to models with a number of conﬁguration-space observables
less than dimension of space of physical degrees of freedom. Just as it happens
in quantum mechanics, such a kind classical mechanics does not admit the notion of
a trajectory within the position space. Classical models with such a strange property
can be constructed on the basis of a singular Lagrangian with a multi-parametric
group of local symmetries.
Consider a theory with N conﬁguration-space variables qA and with k ﬁrst-class
constraints. The original variables generally have ambiguous dynamics, but as we
saw in Sect. 8.4, the theory has the physical sector which consist of 2.N  k/
observables. The observables form N  k canonical pairs Nq.qA; pB/ and Np.qA; pB/.
It is natural to ask, whether there exist N  k observables of the form Nq.qA/. This
would mean that in the model there are trajectories within the position space. An
example of such a kind is the relativistic particle. As we saw on page 314, we
can take xi.x0/ as three conﬁguration-space observables. The model (9.14) gives
an opposite example, without the position observables at all! To conﬁrm this, let us
look for an observable of the form o.!/ in the theory (9.22). Using these equations,
we have Po D !2.o0/ C v.o0!/, where o0 D
@o
@!. The r.h.s. will not depend on
 and v only if o0 is orthogonal to  and !. So o0 	 !  , that is to satisfy the
desired condition, the observable o should depend on .
Summing up, spin in vector model turns out to be essentially phase-space
quantity.

and .t/ gives the equations P!2 D g2ˇ2 and !2 D ˛2, the latter implies P!! D 0.

can integrate out the variable g, presenting the Lagrangian in a more compact form

as well. But this would lead to loss of the manifest rotational invariance of the
formalism.

Note that in the absence of interaction, the spinning particle does not experience a

in unhomogeneous ﬁeld and can be used for semiclassical description of Stern-
Gerlach experiment. Since S2 	 „2, the S-term disappears from Eq. (9.58) at the
classical limit „ ! 0. Then Eq. (9.58) reproduces the classical motion of a charged
particle subject to the Lorentz force.
Precession of Spin Let us denote  ge
2mcB D !p, then Eq. (9.57) reads
PS D !p  S:
(9.59)
The vector PS is orthogonal to the plane of !p and S at any instant. Besides,
contracting Eq. (9.59) with S we see that magnitude of spin does not change,
S2 D const. In the result, the end point of S rotates around the axis !p, see Fig. 9.1
on page 368. This motion is called precession of spin-vector. Let S.0/ D S0 is
the initial position of spin. We present this vector as a sum of longitudinal and
transversal parts with respect to !p, S0 D S0? C S0jj. Then for the constant vector
!p, the general solution to Eq. (9.59) is
S D S0jj C jS0?j.e1 cos j!pjt C e2 sin j!pjt/:

Fig. 9.1 According to the

PS D !p  S, the vector S
rotates around the axis !p

sion. Equation of trajectory (9.58) in the constant magnetic ﬁeld is Pv D 2

that is particle’s velocity precesses with the frequency 2
g!p. For a particle with
classical gyromagnetic ratio g D 2, the two frequences coincide and the angle
between velocity and spin preserves during the evolution. For the anomalous
magnetic moment, g ¤ 2, the frequences are different. The spin precession relative
to the velocity is used in a cyclotron experiments for measurement of anomalous
magnetic moment.

The ﬁrst equation from (9.61) implies the standard quantization of the variables x

we look for the wave-function space which is a representation of the group SO.3/.
Finite-dimensional irreducible representations of the group are numbered by spin
s, which is related with the values of Casimir operator as follows: S2 	 s.s C 1/.
Then Eq. (9.12) ﬁxes the spin s D 1

operators act on the space of two-component complex columns  called spinors.
Quantum Hamiltonian is obtained from Eq. (9.62) replacing classical variables by

The Strange Quantum Mechanics of Dirac Equation,
or Why We Need a Semiclassical Model of Relativistic
Spin?
Dirac Equation We expect that a semiclassical relativistic model of spin should
be closely related to the Dirac equation normally used to describe the relativistic
spin in quantum theory. The consistent description of relativistic spin is achieved in
quantum electrodynamics, where the Dirac equation is considered as a quantum
ﬁeld theory equation. But it also admits a quantum-mechanical interpretation
and thus represents an example of relativistic quantum mechanics. This is of
interest on various reasons. In particular, namely being considered as a quantum-
mechanical equation, the Dirac equation gives the correct energy levels of hydrogen
atom. As we saw in Sect. 9.1.1, dynamical equations for expectation values of
operators in quantum mechanics should resemble the Hamiltonian equations of the
corresponding classical system. Let us discuss these equations in the Dirac theory.
The Dirac equation is a relativistic-covariant ﬁrst-order differential equation for the
four-componentcomplex function .x0; xi/ D .1; 2; 3; 4/ called Dirac spinor.
Detailed discussion of the relevant formalism can be found in the classical textbooks
[36, 37] . Here we only present a few comments which are necessary for discussion
of a classical limit of the Dirac equation.

when it computed over equal-time surface x0 D const of Minkowski space. This
implies an observer-independence of the probability P: all inertial observers, when
they compute P using their coordinates, will compute the same number (9.73).
Thus the relativistic Dirac equation admits a probabilistic interpretation. How-
ever, it is well known that adopting the quantum-mechanical interpretation, we
arrive at a rather strange and controversial picture. We outline here the results of
analysis on the applicability of quantum-mechanical treatment to the free Dirac
equation made by Schrödinger6 in [64]. We multiply the Dirac equation on 0,
representing it in the Schrödinger-like form

Some properties of the equations are in order.
1. The wrong balance of the number of degrees of freedom. The ﬁrst equation
in (9.75) implies that the operator c˛i represents the velocity of the particle. Then
physical meaning of the operator pi becomes rather obscure in the classical limit.

3. Velocity of an electron. Since the velocity operator c˛i has eigenvalues ˙c, we
conclude that a measurement of a component of the velocity of a free electron is
certain to lead to the result ˙c.
4. Operator of relativistic spin. We expect that in the Dirac theory can be con-
structed the relativistic generalization of the spin operator (9.1). The question on
the deﬁnition of a conventional spin operator has been raised a long time ago
[66, 67] and is under discussion up to date.
Many people noticed that in the Dirac theory it is possible to construct another
operators that obey to a reasonable equations [58]. Presenting these equations,
Feynman accompanied them with the following comment (see p. 48 in [65]): “The
following relations may be veriﬁed as true but their meaning is not yet completely
understood, if at all: ...”.
In view of all this, it seem desirable to construct a semiclassical model of spin
that will be as close as possible to the Dirac equation. By this we mean the model
which, being quantized, yields the Dirac equation. In the following sections, we
will see how the vector model clariﬁes the issues discussed above. In a few words,
this can be resumed as follows. As we already saw above, the vector model is
necessarily invariant under the spin-plane local symmetry which determines its
physical sector formed by observables. We show that observables of the vector
model have an expected behavior on both classical and quantum level. Comparing
quantum mechanics of the vector model with that of Dirac equation in Sect. 9.12.4,
we obtain the rules for computation of probabilities and mean values of the vector
model observables using the Dirac equation. The operators (9.382) and (9.385),
which represent observables of spinning particle in the Dirac theory, turn out to be
different from ingenuous operators written in (9.75).
The time evolution implied by the rules (9.387) turn out to be different from the
ingenuous prescription (9.75).
9.4
Spin-Tensor of Frenkel and Lorentz Covariant Form

assume that relativistic spin can be described by a vector !	 of Minkowski space
such that !	 D .0; !/ for the particle at rest in the laboratory frame. This condition

the Newton physics in the limit of small velocities. To represent this condition in
a covariant form in an arbitrary frame, we assume that in our model there exists
a four-vector p	 which for the particle at rest has the components . p0; 0/. For
the case of a free particle, the natural candidate is a vector proportional to the
particle’s four-velocity. For the particle in external ﬁeld, the form of this vector
is dictated by the structure of interaction, see below. With this p	, the Lorentz-
invariant statement p! D 0 is equivalent to the condition that !	 D .0; !/ for the

that is the two quantities are mathematically equivalent, and we could work with

details. In our vector model, even in the case of interaction, the condition ps D 0
implies us D 0. So we expect that our equations of motion for s	 should represent a
generalization of the Bargmann-Michel-Telegdi equations to the case of an arbitrary
electromagnetic ﬁeld.
In summary, the relativistic spin can be described by the Frenkel spin-
tensor (9.80) composed by the dipole electric moment D and the spin S. In our
vector model the Frenkel tensor is a composite quantity, see (9.83). In the rest frame
of the vector p	 we have D D 0, while S coincides with the vector of non-relativistic
spin. Intuitively, the Frenkel tensor shows how the non relativistic spin looks like in
an arbitrary Lorentz frame.

Variational Problem for Prescribed Dirac’s Constraints

Let us look for the Hamiltonian action which could produce these constraints.
According to general theory, it has the form R d pPxC P! .H0CiTi/ where Ti are

Due to the Poisson bracket fT2; T5g D 2T5, in this formulation T5 D 0 appears as

equations of motion, we obtain an action with the auxiliary variables i. Excluding
them, one after another, we obtain various equivalent forms of the Lagrangian
action. To simplify these computations, we proceed as follows. First, we note that
the constraints ! D 0 and p! D 0 always appear from the Lagrangian which
involves the projector N, that is we use NPx and N P! instead of Px and P!. So we set

In summary, besides the “minimal” Lagrangian (9.107) we have obtained two its

the appearance of equation p D 0 as the primary constraint. In turn, this seems
crucial to introduce an interaction consistent with the constraints.
9.6.2
Interaction and the Problem of Covariant Formalism
In the formulation (9.107) without auxiliary variables, our model admits the
minimal interaction with electromagnetic ﬁeld and with gravity. This does not

To introduce an interaction of spin with electromagnetic ﬁeld, we use [82] the
formulation (9.109) with the auxiliary variable 1. We add to the action (9.109) the
term (9.110) and replace

reparametrizations, D0!0 D @

The interaction of spin with gravity through the gravimagnetic moment will be
achieved in the formulation (9.104), see below.
Concerning the interaction of spin with electromagnetic ﬁeld, let us brieﬂy
discuss an issue with nearly a century of history, that is not completely clariﬁed
so far. While the complete relativistic Hamiltonian of the covariant formulation
will be obtained below, its linear on spin part can be predicted from a symmetry
considerations. Indeed, the only Lorentz and U.1/-invariant term which involves F

They differ by the famous and troublesome factor7 of 1
2. The same conclusion
follows from comparison of equations of motion of the two formulations [60]. As
we saw in Sect. 9.1.1, the expression (9.114) has very strong experimental support.
The question, why a covariant formalism does not lead directly to the correct result,
has been raised in 1926 [51], and remain under discussion to date [60].
We show in Sect. 9.8 that the vector model provides an answer to this question
on a pure classical ground, without appeal to the Dirac equation. In a few words it
can be described as follows. The relativistic vector model involves a second-class
constraints (T3 and T4 of Eq. (9.77)), which we take into account by passing from the
Poisson to Dirac bracket. So in the covariant formulation we arrive at the relativistic
Hamiltonian (9.113) accompanied by non canonical classical brackets. To construct
the quantum mechanics, we could work with the relativistic Hamiltonian, but
in this case we need to ﬁnd quantum realization of the non canonical brackets.
Equivalently, we can ﬁnd the variables with canonical brackets and quantize them
in the standard way. The relativistic Hamiltonian (9.113), when written in the
canonical variables, just gives (9.114).

Particle with the Fundamental Length Scale
Our basic model yields the ﬁxed value of spin, as it should be for an elementary
particle. Let us present the modiﬁcation which leads to the theory with unﬁxed
spin, and, similarly to Hanson-Regge approach [71], with a mass-spin trajectory
constraint. Consider the following Lagrangian

˛

7In discussing this factor often refer to Thomas precession [52]. We will not touch this delicate and
controversial issue [72, 73] because of the covariant formalism automatically accounts the Thomas

It has a clear meaning: the energy of the particle grows with its spin. The model
has four physical degrees of freedom in the spin-sector. As the independent gauge-

together with any one product of conjugate coordinates, for instance, !00.
9.6.4
Classiﬁcation of Vector Models
While we concentrate on the model speciﬁed by Eq.(9.77), it is instructive to discuss
other sets of constraints that could be used for construction of a spinning particle.

(9.118)
turns out to be useful in what follows.
1. Our basic model (9.77) with two degrees of freedom implies S	
p
 D 0. Then
Eq. (9.118) implies proportionality of the two spins, 8s2 D S2, whereas their
magnitudes are ﬁxed due to the constraints T2 and T5. The variables x	; p	 and
S	
 have vanishing brackets with ﬁrst-class constraints, so they are candidates
for observables.
2. The model with the constraints !2 D ˛2 and 2 D ˇ2 instead of 2 D
˛
!2 is
essentially equivalent to the basic model.
3. Let us replace T3  p! D 0 by T0
3  p! 
p
!2 D 0 in the set (9.77). These
constraints appear in the model of rigid particle [63], when it is considered using
the formalism described in Sect. 2.10.1. T4 and T5 can be taken as the second-
class constraints, while T2 and T0
3 form the ﬁrst-class subset. As a consequence,
the model has two degrees of freedom. The Poincaré and Lorentz spins are
proportional and have ﬁxed magnitudes. The variables x	 and S	
 have non
vanishing brackets with ﬁrst-class constraints. After canonical quantization, the
constraint T0
3 D 0 turns into the Dirac equation. Hence this semiclassical model
can be used to study the relation among classical observables and operators of
the Dirac theory.

5. To avoid the unobservable character of original variables in the model (9.119), we
could replace S

They provide S	
p
 D 0 and 8  2 D 6 degrees of freedom.
6. Adding the ﬁrst-class constraint ! D 0 to the model of Item 5 we arrive at the
Lagrangian (9.115) with four degrees of freedom.
7. There are models based on the light-like vector !	 [74]. Consider the ﬁrst-class
constraints
!2 D 0; ! D 0; 2. p!/2 D const;
then
s2 D const; S2 D 0:
(9.120)
This implies two degrees of freedom. The Poincaré and Lorentz spins, while are
ﬁxed, do not correlate one with another. The variables x	, S	
 and s	 are not
observable quantities. We note also that S	
p
 ¤ 0, this complicates the analysis
of non relativistic limit.
8. Let us replace 2. p!/2 D const by
p
2. p!/ D const in the set (9.120).
Similarly to Item 3, this constraint may be classical analog of the Dirac equation.
This model still has not been studied.
A common for the models 5–8 is the problem whether they admit an interaction
with external ﬁelds. Concerning the Hanson-Regge model, in their work [71] they
analyzed whether the spin-tensor interacts directly with an electromagnetic ﬁeld,
and concluded on impossibility to construct the interaction in a closed form. In our
vector model an electromagnetic ﬁeld interacts with the part !	 of the spin-tensor.

In this rather technical section we demonstrate that our variational problem yields
a model of spinning particle with expected properties. In particular, our equations

Neither constraints nor equations of motion do not determine the variables  and

symmetries of the free theory. As a consequence, all the basic variables have
ambiguous evolution. x	 and P	 have one-parametric ambiguity due to  while
! and  have two-parametric ambiguity due to  and 2. The variables with
ambiguous dynamics do not represent observable quantities, so we need to search
for the variables that can be candidates for observables. We note that (9.143) imply

reparametrization invariance and disappears when we work with physical dynamical

Equations (9.142) and (9.144), together with (9.145), form a closed system which
determines evolution of a spinning particle.
The quantities x	, P	 and S	
, being invariant under spin-plane symmetry,
have vanishing brackets with the corresponding ﬁrst-class constraints T2 and T5.
So, obtaining equations for these quantities, we can omit the corresponding terms
in the Hamiltonian (9.129). Further, we can construct the Dirac bracket for the
second-class pair T3 and T4. Since the Dirac bracket of a second-class constraint
with any quantity vanishes, we can now omit T3 and T4 from (9.129). Then the
relativistic Hamiltonian acquires an expected form (compare it with the square of
Dirac equation (9.68))

„2
c3 . The
interaction also modiﬁes the constraints. In particular, the condition S

of a free theory turns into S	
P
 D 0 with P

. This has an important
consequence. If we adopt the standard special relativity notions of time and distance,
the components S0i vanish in the frame P	 D .P0; E0/ instead of the rest frame.
Hence our model predicts small dipole electric moment of the particle immersed in
an external ﬁeld.
Other important point is the emergence of an effective metric (9.148) for the
particle in ﬂat space. As we saw above, the incorporation of the constraints (9.145)
into a variational problem, as well as the search for an interaction consistent with
them turn out to be rather non trivial tasks, and the action (9.121) is probably the
only solution of the problem. So, the appearance of effective metric (9.148) in
equations of motion seems to be unavoidable in a systematically constructed model
of spinning particle. An important consequences will be discussed in Sect. 9.8.
Summing up, in general case the Lorentz force is modiﬁed due to the presence of
(time-dependent) radiation mass mr (9.149), the tetrad ﬁeld QT, the effective metric
G and due to two extra-terms on right hand side of (9.152).
Consider the “classical” value of magnetic moment 	 D 1. Then QT D  and G D
. The Lorentz force is modiﬁed due to the presence of time-dependent radiation
mass mr, and two extra-terms on right hand side of (9.152).
Homogeneous Field The structure of our equations simpliﬁes signiﬁcantly for the
homogeneous ﬁeld @˛F	
 D 0, then Z	 D 0. Contraction of (9.154) with F	
yields .SF/PD 0, that is S	
F	
 turns out to be the conserved quantity. This implies
Pmr D Pa D Pb D 0. Hence the Lorentz force is modiﬁed due to the presence of time-
independent radiation mass mr, the tetrad ﬁeld QT and the effective metric G. The

First Relativistic Corrections and Fine Structure of Hydrogen Spectrum

To continue, let us restrict to the case of a stationary electromagnetic ﬁeld. Then
constraints do not depend explicitly on time, therefore the second-class constraints
can be omitted from the Hamiltonian, see Sect. 8.5. So we omit the last two terms
in (9.169). The ﬁrst-class constraints T2 and T5 can be omitted as well, as they do
not contribute into equations of motion for physical variables. In the result we obtain

Note that the Dirac brackets encode the most part of spin-ﬁeld interaction, on this
reason we have arrived at a rather simple form of physical Hamiltonian.
9.8
First Relativistic Corrections and Fine Structure
of Hydrogen Spectrum
Here we discuss how the vector model resolves the problem of a covariant formalism
discussed in Sect. 9.6.2.
To quantize our relativistic theory we need to ﬁnd quantum realization of highly
non linear classical brackets (9.174)–(9.178). They remain non canonical even in
absence of interaction. For instance, Eq. (9.174) in a free theory reads fxi; xjg D
1
2mcp0 Sij. We emphasize that non relativistic model has canonical brackets (9.61),
so the deformation arises as a relativistic correction induced by spin of a particle.
Technically, the deformation is due to the fact that the constraints (9.306) of
relativistic theory, used to construct the Dirac bracket, mixes up space-time and
inner-space coordinates.
Quantum realization of the brackets in a free theory will be obtained in Sect. 9.11,
while in an interacting theory its explicit form is unknown. Therefore we quantize
the interacting theory perturbatively [77], considering c1 as a small parameter
and expanding all quantities in a power series. Let us consider the approximation
O.c2/, that is we neglect c3 and higher order terms. For the Hamiltonian (9.179)
we have Hph  mc2 C P2

Due to the second and fourth terms, we need to know the operators OPi and Oxi up
to order c2, while OSij should be found up to order c1. With this approximation,
the commutators ŒOx; Ox, ŒOx; OP, and Œ OP; OP can be computed up to order c2, while
the remaining commutators can be written only up to c1. Therefore, we expand the

The ﬁrst three terms corresponds to an increase of relativistic mass. The last two

the ﬁne structure of hydrogen atom.
We could carry out the same reasoning in classical theory, by asking on the new

In the desired approximation they are Pi D P0i, xi D x0i 

Fast Spinning Particle and Rainbow Geometry
Basic notions of Special and General Relativity have been formulated before the
discovery of spin, so they describe the properties of space and time as they are seen
by spinless test-particle. Here we discuss the question whether these notions remain
the same if the spinless particle is replaced by more realistic spinning test-particle.
Let us compare the Lagrangian equations of spinning (9.152) and spinless (1.309)
particle. For the spinning particle with 	 ¤ 1, the relativistic-contraction factor
(see (9.151)) contains the effective metric (9.148) instead of the Minkowski metric
	
. In the result, equations for trajectory (9.152) and for precession of spin (9.153)
became singular at the critical velocity which obeys the equation
PxGPx D 0:
(9.189)
As we discussed in Sect. 1.7.7, the singularity determines behavior of the particle
in ultra-relativistic limit. The effective metric is composed from the Minkowski
one plus (spin and ﬁeld-dependent) contribution, G D  C h.S/. So we need to
decide, which of them should be used to construct the three-dimensional geometry
discussed in Sect. 6.9. We ﬁrst test the usual special-relativity notions, vi D
dxi
dt ,
ai D dvi
dt and va D viai, that is we suppose that the particle sees  as the space-time
metric. We show that in this case acceleration vanishes at the critical speed which is

different from the speed of light. Then we estimate the ultra-relativistic limit using
G to deﬁne the three-dimensional geometry (6.140)–(6.143). Then vcr D c, but
since G depends on spin, particles with different spins will probe slightly different
three-dimensional geometries.
Ultra Relativistic Limit Within the Usual Special-Relativity Notions It will
be sufﬁcient to estimate the acceleration in the uniform and stationary ﬁeld. We
take  D t in Eqs. (9.152)–(9.154) and compute the time derivative on l. h. s. of
Eq. (9.152) with 	 D 1; 2; 3. Then the equations read

For the particle with non anomalous magnetic moment (	 D 1), the right hand side
reduces to the Lorentz force, so the expression in braces is certainly non vanishing
in the ultra-relativistic limit. Thus the acceleration vanishes only when v ! vcr,
where the critical velocity is determined by the equation vGv D 0.
Let us estimate the critical velocity. Using the consequence .PxSFPx/ D b.	 

As  and ! are space-like vectors, the last term is non-negative, so vcr  c. We

Ultra-Relativistic Limit Within the Geometry Determined by Effective Metric
As we saw above, if we insist to preserve the usual special-relativity deﬁnitions
of time and distance, the speed of light does not represent special point of the
equation for trajectory. Acceleration of the particle with anomalous magnetic
moment generally vanishes at the speed slightly higher than the speed of light.
Hence we arrive at a rather surprising result that speed of light does not represent
maximum velocity of the manifestly relativistic equation (9.196). This state of
affairs is unsatisfactory because the Lorentz transformations have no sense above
c, so two observers with relative velocity c < v < vcr will not be able to compare
results of their measurements.
To keep the condition vcr D c, we use formal similarity of the matrix G
appeared in (9.148) with space-time metric. Then we can follow the general-
relativity prescription of Sect. 6.9 to deﬁne time and distance in the presence
of electromagnetic ﬁeld. That is we use G of Eq. (9.148) to deﬁne the three-
dimensional geometry (6.140)–(6.143). The effective metric depends on xi via the
ﬁeld strength F.x0; xi/, and on x0 via the ﬁeld strength as well as via the spin-tensor
S.x0/. So the effective metric is time-dependent even in stationary electromagnetic
ﬁeld. With these deﬁnitions we have, by construction, PxGPx D . dt
dx0 /2.c2  .vv//,
so the critical speed coincides with the speed of light. The intervals of time and
distance are given now by Eq. (6.140) and (6.141), they slightly differ from those in
empty space.
In the present case, the expression for three-acceleration can be obtained in
closed form in an arbitrary electromagnetic ﬁeld. We present Eq.(9.152) in the
form (6.177)

Then the acceleration is given by (6.179). The ﬁrst two terms on right hand side

In summary, to preserve the equality vcr D c, we are forced to assume that
particle in electromagnetic ﬁeld probes the three-dimensional geometry determined
with respect to the effective metric instead of the Minkowski metric. This implies
rather unusual picture of the Universe with rainbow geometry.8 Since G depends
on spin, in this picture there is no unique space-time manifold for the Universe of
spinning particles: each particle will probe his own three-dimensional geometry. In
principle this could be an observable effect. With the effective metric (9.148), the
Eq. (6.140) implies that the time of life of muon in electromagnetic ﬁeld and in
empty space should be different.
9.10
Interaction with Gravitational Field
Point particle in a gravitational ﬁeld propagates along a geodesic line with the speed
less then speed of light, see Sect. 6.9. Here we study the inﬂuence of rotational
degrees of freedom on trajectory of the particle.
8Some models of doubly special relativity predict rainbow geometry at Planck scale [83].

Lagrangian of Spinning Particle with Gravimagnetic

As we saw in Sect. 9.6.2, minimal interaction with gravitational ﬁeld can be
achieved by direct covariantization of the action (9.107). Unfortunately, the result-
ing equations becomes problematic in ultra-relativistic regime. We show this in
sect. 9.10.3. So we are forced to look for a non minimal interaction that could
suitably modify the equations in this regime. To understand how they might look, we
use the remarkable analogy existing between the gravitational and electromagnetic
ﬁelds. Hamiltonian formulations of the two minimally interacting theories become
very similar if we identify electromagnetic ﬁeld strength with the Riemann tensor
contracted with spin, F

class.
Neither constraints nor equations of motion do not determine the functions 1
and 2, that is the non-minimal interaction preserves both reparametrization and
spin-plane symmetries of the theory. The presence of 1 and 2 in the Eqs. (9.223)
and (9.224) implies that evolution of the basic variables is ambiguous, so they
are not observable. To ﬁnd the candidates for observables, we note once again
that (9.223) and (9.224) imply an equation for S	
 which does not contain 2. So
we rewrite (9.221) and (9.222) in terms of spin-tensor and add to them the equation

The Eq. (9.236) imply that only two components of spin-tensor are independent, as
it should be for spin one-half particle. Equation (9.234), contrary to the equations
for ! and , does not depend on 2. This proves that the spin-tensor is invariant
under local spin-plane symmetry. The remaining ambiguity due to 1 is related with
reparametrization invariance and disappears when we work with physical dynamical
variables xi.t/. Equations (9.232)–(9.234), together with (9.235) and (9.236), form
a closed system which determines evolution of the spinning particle.

Mathisson-Papapetrou-Tulczyjew-Dixon (MPTD)
Equations of a Rotating Body and Spinning Particle
without Gravimagnetic Moment
Equations of motion of a rotating body in curved background formulated usually
in the multipole approach to description of the body, see [76] for the review. In
this approach, energy-momentum of the body is modelled by a set of quantities
called multipoles. The equations are then derived from conservation law for the
energy-momentumtensor, r	T	
 D 0. The ﬁrst results were reported by Mathisson
[53] and Papapetrou [54]. They have taken the approximation which involves only
ﬁrst two terms (the pole-dipole approximation). A manifestly covariant equations
were formulated by Tulczyjew [55] and Dixon [56]. In the current literature they
usually appear in the form given by Dixon (the equations (6.31)–(6.33) in [56]),
we will refer them as Mathisson-Papapetrou-Tulczyjew-Dixon (MPTD) equations.
They are widely used now to account spin effects in compact binaries and rotating
black holes, see [60].
We discuss MPTD-equations in the form studied by Dixon9

and show that they essentially coincide with equations of spinning particle with
 D 0. In particular, we show that the effective metric G	
 also emerges in this
formalism. In the multipole approach, x	./ is called representative point of the
body, we take it in arbitrary parametrization  (contrary to Dixon, we do not assume
the proper-time parametrization, that is we do not add the equation g

is called momentum. The ﬁrst-order equations (9.246) and (9.247) appear in the
pole-dipole approximation, while the algebraic equation (9.248) has been added by
hand. After that, the number of equations coincides with the number of variables.
To compare MPTD-equations with those of spinning particle, we ﬁrst observe
some useful consequences of the system (9.246)–(9.248).

For latter use we observe that in our model with composite S	
 we used the
identity (9.229) to invert T, then the Hamiltonian equation (9.232) has been written
in the form (9.243), the latter can be compared with (9.251).

Substituting (9.251) into the Eqs. (9.246)–(9.248) we now can exclude P	 from
these equations, modulo to the constant of motion k D
p
P2.
Thus, square of momentum can not be excluded from the system (9.246)–(9.249),
that is MPTD-equations in this form do not represent a Hamiltonian system for the
pair x	; P	. To improve this point, we note that Eq. (9.251) acquires a conventional
form (as the expression for conjugate momenta of x	 in the Hamiltonian formalism),
if we add to the system (9.246)–(9.248) one more equation, which ﬁxes the
remaining quantity P2. To see, how the equation could look, we note that for

the two systems, we see that the missing equation is the mass-shell condition

the only constant of motion in arbitrary background is S2, we have ﬁnally
P2 D .mc/2  f.S2/:
(9.252)
With this value of P2, we can exclude P	 from MPTD-equations, obtaining closed
system with second-order equation for x	 (so we refer the resulting equations as
Lagrangian form of MPTD-equations). We substitute (9.251) into (9.246)–(9.248),

MPTD-particle the spin is a constant of motion and momentum is a function of
spin. We conclude that all the trajectories of a body with given m and S2 D ˇ are
described by our spinning particle with spin ˛ D

Classical and Quantum Relativistic Mechanics of a Spinning Particle
The singularity determines behavior of the particle in ultra-relativistic limit. The
effective metric is composed from the original one plus (spin and ﬁeld-dependent)
contribution, G D gCh.S/. So we need to decide, which of them the particle probes
as the space-time metric. Let us consider separately the two possibilities.
Let us use g to deﬁne the three-dimensional geometry (6.140)–(6.143). This
leads to two problems. The ﬁrst problem is that the critical speed turns out to be
slightly more than the speed of light. To see this, we use the supplementary spin
condition (9.264) to write (9.267) in the form

 dt

C

.m2c2/2

2.v!/2 C !2.v/2
D 0:
(9.269)
As  and ! are space-like vectors, the last term is non-negative, this implies jvcrj 
c. Let us conﬁrm that generally this term is nonvanishing function of velocity, then
jvcrj > c. Assume the contrary, that this term vanishes at some velocity, then
v! D 0i!i C i0vi!0 D 0;
(9.270)
v D 0ii C i0vi0 D 0:
(9.271)
We analyze these equations in the following special case. Consider a space with
covariantly-constant curvature r	R	
˛ˇ D 0. Then
d
d .	
S	
/ D 2	
rS	
, and
using (9.266) we conclude that 	
S	
 is an integral of motion. We further assume
that the only non vanishing is the electric part of the curvature, R0i0j D Kij. Then the
integral of motion acquires the form
	
S	
 D 2KijS0iS0j:
(9.272)
Let us take the initial conditions for spin such that KijS0iS0j ¤ 0, then this holds at
any future instant. Contrary to this, the system (9.270) implies KijS0iS0j D 0. Thus,
the critical speed does not always coincide with the speed of light and, in general
case, we expect that vcr is both ﬁeld and spin-dependent quantity.
The second problem is that acceleration of MPTD-particle grows up in the ultra-
relativistic limit. In the spinless limit the Eq. (9.265) turn into the geodesic equation.
Spin causes deviations from the geodesic equation due to right hand side of this
equation, as well as due to the presence of the tetrad ﬁeld QT and of the effective
metric G in the left hand side. Due to the dependence of the tetrad ﬁeld on the
spin-tensor S, the singularity presented in (9.266) causes the appearance of the term
proportional to
1
p
PxGPx in the expression for longitudinal acceleration. In the result, the

9.10

acceleration grows up to inﬁnity as the particle’s speed approximates to the critical
speed. To see this, we separate derivative of QT in Eq. (9.265)

(9.290)
With f i given in (9.288), the longitudinal acceleration vanishes as v ! c.
Let us resume the results of this section. Assuming that spinning particle probes
the three-dimensional space-time geometry determined by the original metric g, we
have a theory with unsatisfactory ultra-relativistic limit. First, the critical speed,
which the particle can not overcome during its evolution in gravitational ﬁeld,
can be more then the speed of light. Second, the longitudinal acceleration grows
up to inﬁnity in the ultra-relativistic limit. Assuming that the particle sees the
effective metric G(S) as the space-time metric, we avoided the two problems. But
the resulting theory still possess the problem. The acceleration (9.289) contains
the singularity due to f i 	
1
p
c2.vv/, that is at v D c the acceleration becomes
orthogonal to the velocity, but remains divergent. We conclude that MPTD-
equations do not seem promising candidate for description of a relativistic rotating
body.

The unexpected behavior of MPTD-particle originates from the fact that variation

contributes into the expression for acceleration (9.286) through the tetrad ﬁeld QT.S/.

These equations can be compared with (9.265) and (9.266). In the modiﬁed
theory:
1. Time interval and distance should be unambiguously deﬁned within the original
space-time metric g	
. So the critical speed is equal to the speed of light.
2. Covariant precession of spin (9.295) has a smooth behavior, in particular, for
homogeneous ﬁeld, rR D 0, we have rS 	 pPxgPx contrary to rS

the Eq.(9.266).
3. Spin ceases to affect the trajectory in ultra-relativistic limit: the trajectory of
spinning particle becomes more and more close to that of spinless particle as
v ! c. Besides, the spin precesses with ﬁnite angular velocity in this limit.
10Besides S	
P
 D 0, there are known others supplementary spin conditions. In this respect we
point out that the MPTD theory implies this condition with certain P
 written in Eq. (9.258).
Introducing , we effectively changed P
 and hence changed the supplementary spin condition. For
instance, when  D 1 and in the space with rR D 0, we have P	 D

4. Even in homogeneous ﬁeld we have modiﬁed dynamics for both x and S. The
Eq. (9.294) in the space with homogeneous curvature has the structure similar
to (1.309), hence we expect that longitudinal acceleration vanishes as v ! c. Let
us conﬁrm this by direct computations.
To ﬁnd the acceleration, we separate derivative of the radiation mass mr and write

(9.300)
With the smooth f i given in Eq. (9.297), and as v ! c, the acceleration (9.299)

identity (6.169), we have .v/i f i v!c

In resume, contrary to MPTD-equations, the modiﬁed theory is consistent with
respect to the original metric g

promising for description of the rotating objects in astrophysics.

Classical and Quantum Relativistic Mechanics of a Spinning Particle
9.11
One-Particle Quantum Mechanics of a Spinning
Particle, Canonical Formalism
As we have seen above, on the classical level our vector model adequately
describes spinning particle in an arbitrary gravitational and electromagnetic ﬁelds.
Moreover, taking into account the leading relativistic corrections in quantized theory
with interaction, we have explained the famous one-half factor in non-relativistic
Hamiltonian (9.114), see Sect. 9.7.3. Now we turn to a systematic discussion of our
model on the quantum level. In this section we construct quantum mechanics of the
free theory (9.109) in the physical-time parametrization. This yields Schrödinger
equation (9.328), with the Hamiltonian c
p
p2 C .mc/2 acting on a space of two-
component wave functions. Note that all the solutions have positive energy. The
novel point is that the naive expressions, xi and i, do not represent operators
of position and spin of our theory. This is due to the second-class constraints
p! D p D 0 of the relativistic theory, which guarantee the supplementary
spin condition S	
p
 D 0. The constraints should be taken into account with
help of Dirac bracket, this implies a deformation of classical brackets which are
subject to quantization. In the result, the position and spin of a spinning particle are
represented by the operators (9.324) and (9.99). The remaining sections are devoted
to establishing of Lorentz covariance of the obtained quantum mechanics.

The spin-sector variables have ambiguous evolution, because a general solution

9.11

421
and in the expression for Hamiltonian (9.305) we can omit the last two terms.
Besides, we omit the second and third terms, as they do not contribute into equations
for observables. In the result, we obtain the physical Hamiltonian
Hph D cp0 D c
p
p2 C .mc/2:
(9.319)
As it should be, the Eqs. (9.307), (9.310) and (9.311) follow from physical Hamil-
tonian with the use of Dirac bracket, Pz D fz; HphgD, where z D .p; x; S	
; s	/.
Both operators (except Opi) and abstract state-vectors of the physical-time formal-
ism we denote by capital letters, OZ, .t; x/. In order to quantize the model, classical
Dirac-bracket algebra should be realized by operators, Œ OZi; OZj D i„ fzi; zjgD
ˇˇ
zi! OZi.
To ﬁnd the quantum realization, we ﬁrst look for classical variables which have
canonical Dirac brackets, thus simplifying the quantization procedure. We introduce
the variables Qxj, Qp j D p j and Qsj as follows [78]

(9.321)
Note that in the expression for x and Qx we can replace Qs $ s. We point out
that the original and new variables obey the same equations of motion (9.307)
and (9.311), so they are indistinguishable in the free theory. In an interacting theory
their dynamics will be different.
The new variables have a canonical algebra with respect to Dirac brackets
fQxj; QxigD D 0;
fQxi; p jgD D ıij;
fQxj; QsigD D 0;
fQsi; QsjgD D ijkQsk:
(9.322)
Besides, the constraints (9.311) on s	 imply Qs2 D
3
4„2. So the corresponding
operators OQSj should realize an irreducible representation of SO.3/ with spin s D 1=2.
Quantization in terms of these variables becomes straightforward. The Hilbert space
consists from two-component functions a.t; x/, a D 1; 2. A realization of the Dirac
brackets by operators has the standard form

pair of square-root equations i„@t D cˇOp0. Applying the FW transformation,
the Pryce operators acquire block-diagonal form on space , see Table 9.4. Our
operators act on space of solutions of square-root equation (9.328), so we compared
them with positive-energy parts (upper-left blocks) of Pryce operators in the
Table 9.4.
Our operators of canonical variables OQXj D xj and OQSj correspond to the Pryce (e)
(	 Foldy-Wouthuysen 	 Newton-Wigner) position and spin operators.
However, operators of position xj and spin Sj of our model are OXj and OSj. They
correspond to the Pryce (d)-operators.

PL is the Pryce (c) spin (we remind the
normalization of our sj, see (9.96)).
9.12
Relativistic Covariance of Canonical Formalism
While we have started from the relativistic theory (9.301), working in the physical-
time parametrization we have lost, from the beginning, the manifest relativistic
covariance. Whether the quantum mechanics thus obtained is a relativistic theory?
In particular, are the scalar product (9.329) and probability (9.330) the Lorentz-
invariant quantities? Are the mean values h; OXi˚i and h; OSi˚i the Lorentz-
covariant quantities? To answer these questions, we follow the standard ideology
of quantum theory. First we associate with our theory the manifestly covariant
Hilbert space of representation of Poincare group. Second, using the covariant
formulation (9.302) of the classical theory, we ﬁnd quantum realization of basic
variables by means of covariant operators acting in this space. The resulting
construction is called a covariant formalism. Third, we establish a correspondence
between the canonical and covariant pictures and show that the scalar products,
mean values and transition amplitudes of canonical formalism can be computed
using the covariant formalism. This proves the relativistic covariance of quantum
mechanics constructed in Sect. 9.11.
As we saw above, state-vectors of spinning particle belong to space of solutions
to the covariant two-component Klein-Gordon equation. So it is natural to construct
the covariant formalism on this base. We do this in the next subsection. The
covariant formalism based on the space of solutions to the Dirac equation will be
discussed in Sect. 9.12.4.
We emphasize that quantum mechanics of Sect. 9.11 already has a clear physical
interpretation: the state vector  describes a spinning particle with positive energy
in Qx-representation, the operator OX represents a position, OS represents a spin and so
on. Therefore there is no need to search physical interpretation of the covariant
formalism, and we will not do it. We consider the covariant formalism as an
auxiliary construction that has the only aim to prove the relativistic covariance of
the quantum mechanics formulated in Sect. 9.11.

9.12.1
Relativistic Quantum Mechanics of Two-Component
Klein-Gordon Equation
We denote states and operators of covariant formalism by small letters, to distin-
guish them from the quantities of canonical formalism.
According to Wigner [49, 69, 70], with an elementary particle in quantum-ﬁeld
theory we associate the Hilbert space of representation of Poincare group. The space
can be described in a manifestly covariant form as a space of solutions to Klein-
Gordon equation for properly chosen multicomponent ﬁeld  a.x	/. The space of
one-component ﬁelds corresponds to spin-zero particle. It is well-known, that this
space has no quantum-mechanicalinterpretation. In contrast, two-component Klein-
Gordon equation does admit the probabilistic interpretation. As we show below, the
four-vector (9.340) represents positively deﬁned conserved current of this equation.
Using the current, we can deﬁne an invariant scalar product and hence the covariant
rules for computing mean values of covariant operators deﬁned on this space.
The two-component Klein-Gordon equation has been considered by Feynman
and Gell-Mann [79] to describe weak interaction of spin one-half particle.
Using the Pauli matrices (9.2) we form the two sets
	 D .1; i/;
N	 D .1; i/:
(9.332)
All the matrices are hermitian and obey the following rules of permutation of
indexes:
	 N

(9.333)
Further we deﬁne two more sets of 2  2-matrices

Besides, the scalar product is positive-deﬁned, since

that transformation properties of the column  are in agreement with this scalar

Equation (9.344) suggests the map of canonical space fg onto subspace of
positive-energy solutions of covariant space f g, W1 W fg ! f g;  D W1.
The map respects the scalar products (9.329) and (9.342), and thus proves

Relativistic invariance of the scalar product (9.329) has been already shown in

covariance. Namely, we conﬁrm the following

We see that this scalar product separates positive and negative energy parts of
state vectors. Since our classical theory contains only positive energies, we restrict
our further considerations by the positive-energy solutions. In the momentum
representation the scalar product (9.342) reads through non-trivial metric  and the
through V as follows:

Now our basic space is composed by arbitrary functions  .p/. The operators Oxi,
Os	 and Os	
 act on this space as before, with the only modiﬁcation, that Op0 .p/ D
!p .p/. The operator Ox0 and, as a consequence, the operator Ox0
rp, do not act in this
space. Fortunately, they are not necessary to prove the proposition formulated above.
Given operator OA we denoted its hermitian conjugated in space HC
can as OA.
Hermitian operators in space HC
can have both real eigenvalues and expectation values.
Consider an operator Oa in space Hcov with real expectation values . ; Oa / D
. ; Oa /. It should obey Oa D Oa. That is, such an operator in Hcov should be
pseudo-Hermitian. We denote pseudo-Hermitian conjugation in Hcov as follows:
Oac D 1Oa. Then pseudo-Hermitian part of an arbitrary operator Oa is given by
1
2.Oa C Oac/.
Let us check the pseudo-Hermiticity properties of basic operators. From the
following identities:

Relation with Dirac Equation
Here we demonstrate the equivalence of quantum mechanics of two-component
Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations. As a consequence, probabilities and mean val-
ues of canonical operators (9.324)–(9.99) can be computed, using an appropriately
constructed covariant operators on the space of Dirac spinors.
Let us replace two equations of second order, (9.339), by an equivalent system
of four equations of the ﬁrst order. To achieve this, with the aid of the identity

The conserved current (9.340) of Klein-Gordon equation (9.339), being rewritten in
terms of Dirac spinor, coincides with the Dirac current (9.71). Therefore, the scalar

We emphasize that the observables of vector model have an expected behavior
both on classical and quantum level. In particular, the position operator OXi does
not experiences Zitterbewegung. Note also that the covariant operator (9.385), that
represents the position of spinning particle in the Dirac theory, is different from the
naive expression used in Eq. (9.75).
For convenience, we collected our notation for different operators in the
Table 9.6.
The Map V and Foldy-Wouthuysen Transformation Our map V, that relates
canonical and two-component Klein-Gordon spaces, turns out to be in close relation
with the Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation. The latter is given by unitary operator

We completed construction of relativistic quantum mechanics for the vector
model of spinning particle. We emphasize once again, that we have not tried to
ﬁnd an interpretation of negative-energy states presented in the covariant Klein-
Gordon and Dirac formalisms. The formalisms were considered as an auxiliary
constructions that allow us to prove relativistic covariance of the quantum mechan-
ics formulated in Sect. 9.11.
