“Un bel problema, anche se non lo risolvi, ti
fa compagnia se ci pensi ogni tanto.”
Ennio De Giorgi
“Computer science is no more about
computers than astronomy is about
telescopes.”
Edsger W. Dijkstra
“The mathematician’s patterns, like the
painter’s or the poet’s must be beautiful; the
ideas, like the colours or the words, must ﬁt
together in a harmonious way. Beauty is the
ﬁrst test: there is no permanent place in the
world for ugly mathematics.”
Godfrey Harold Hardy

Preface
The fundamental aspect of the Theory of Computation is to understand the power
and limitations of algorithms and, by consequence, of computers.
From a historical point of view, the ﬁrst limitation considered in the development
and analysis of algorithms has been the lack of unlimited computational power. This
has lead to the birth of Complexity Theory, classifying problems with respect to the
hardness of computing or, subordinately, approximating their solutions (Theory of
Approximation Algorithms). The second limitation come under scrutiny has been
the lack of knowledge of the input instance, which has given rise to the Theory
of Online Algorithms. Finally, the third and last limitation to be considered has
been the lack of coordination among the parties implementing the solution of a
computational problem in a multi-agent system. Together with other questions, this
has lead to the birth of Algorithmic Game Theory and, in particular, to the systematic
study of the Price of Anarchy of non-cooperative games.
Some of the most basic and general solutions developed in the ﬁeld of approx-
imation and online algorithms, although focusing on different aspects of computa-
tion, share a unifying common feature: they can be naturally and effectively attacked
by using instruments coming from the Theory of Linear Programming and Duality.
Primal-dual formulations, in particular, have proved to hold the key of this power
and one can refer to Vazirani [173] and Buckbinder and Naor [47] for applications
to approximation and online algorithms, respectively.
Given this huge ﬂexibility, it becomes natural to ask whether primal-dual for-
mulations may also be used to successfully characterize the Price of Anarchy of
games. It turns out that the answer is yes, as demonstrated by the seminal work of
Vittorio Bil`o [22], where previously known results for a fundamental class of non-
cooperative games, called congestion games, were re-obtained by analysing suitable
pairs of primal-dual formulations. Congestion games are perhaps the most studied
and representative class of non-cooperative games, and are often elicited as the stan-
dard arena where to test and apply new solution concepts, modeling ideas and proof
techniques.
Starting from this evidence, we have produced a series of works applying primal-
dual formulations to answer a variety of questions in the realm of congestion games,

often solving open problems, or widely generalizing previously known results. A
big portion of these works was obtained during Cosimo Vinci’s PhD program, and
the resulting thesis was named the Best Italian PhD Thesis in Theoretical Computer
Science of 2019 by the Italian Chapter of the European Association for Theoretical
Computer Science. As part of the award, an agreement between the Italian Chap-
ter and Springer established the publication of the thesis. This agreement has been
subsequently modiﬁed and extended to produce the present monograph.
Although we left out some of the most involved and tedious constructions, the
book contents are rather technical and require strong bases in mathematics and theo-
retical computer science. Thus, we believe that it is unlikely to be used as a textbook
in undergraduate courses, but rather it may hopefully serve as a reference guide to
postgraduate students and researchers who may be interested in deepen their knowl-
edge on the fascinating ﬁeld of the price of anarchy in congestion games and related
topics.
We would like to conclude by pointing out that the techniques outlined in this
book have been recently exported outside the realm of congestion games, see [40].
This should boost additional motivations to explore and master the power of primal-
dual formulations as an investigation tool for characterizing the impact selﬁsh be-
havior in non-cooperative games.

The content of this book is mainly based on the results achieved by the authors when
Cosimo Vinci was a PhD student at the Gran Sasso Science Institute (GSSI), under
the supervision of Vittorio Bil`o. The authors would like to highlight that the writing
of this book is not only the result of their research activity, but it has been possible
thanks to the work and support of other people, whom the authors deeply thank.
First of all, the authors would like to thank Wayne Wheeler, Ronan Nugent,
Priyanshi Peelwan, Naomi Portnoy and the editorial board of the EATCS Mono-
graphs book series, for their precious editorial work and the time they dedicated
during all stages of writing the book. Furthermore, the authors wish to express indi-
vidual thanks to all those who have contributed to the research work on which this
book is based, with both their scientiﬁc and human support (see below).
VB: I have been studying the consequences of selﬁsh behavior since 2003, when
my then-PhD supervisor Michele Flammini told me about this research topic after
a visit at IMT of Lucca. Since then, it has been a twenty-year pleasant trip during
which I had the privilege to collaborate with some colleagues with whom I also
developed long-standing friendship relations: Michele, Angelo Fanelli, Gianpiero
Monaco, Luca Moscardelli, Ioannis Caragiannis, Marios Mavronicolas.
At a certain point during the trip, I was lucky to meet Cosimo and become his
advisor. Although I could perceive his talent for research, what Cosimo achieved
during his PhD went beyond my wildest dreams and the credit he got for his work
is surely well deserved.
I believe that good-quality research is often the result of a good-quality state-
of-mind. Thus, a special thank goes to my family: my parents, my brothers, my
sisters-in-law, my nephews and to Valentina.
CV: First of all, I wish to express all my gratitude to my doctoral supervisor, Prof.
Vittorio Bil`o (from the University of Salento), with whom I co-authored several re-
search works, including this book. Vittorio is a very brilliant scientist and professor
and, at the same time, a very good person and friend. He has encouraged me to pur-
sue a scientiﬁc career, and he has introduced me into the world of research, giving
me a lot of inspiration. The precious work of Vittorio, his guidance, support and

Coping with Selﬁshness in Congestion Games
“To feel much for others and little for ourselves; to restrain our selﬁshness and
exercise our benevolent affections, constitute the perfection of human nature.”
Adam Smith
1.1 The Impact of Selﬁsh Behavior in Congestion Games
Since the end of the twentieth century, the computer science community has been
interested in the study of complex systems populated by (numerous) rational agents
interacting with each other, and in how their selﬁsh behavior impacts on the overall
social welfare. The study of these systems is related to the theory of non-cooperative
games (Nash [133], Osborne [136], von Neumann and Morgenstern [177]), where
selﬁsh players choose a strategy from a set of alternatives with the aim of optimizing
their own utility function, which depends also on the strategic choices of the others.
In this setting, the notion of pure Nash equilibrium (Nash [133]), that is, a strategy
proﬁle in which no player gets a beneﬁt when unilaterally changing her strategy, is
widely adopted as the ideal solution concept, and several classes of games have been
shown to posses such equilibria. Further generalizations of this concept, such as
mixed Nash equilibria, correlated equilibria, coarse correlated equilibria and Bayes-
Nash equilibria, have also been largely used and investigated (Aumann [10], Moulin
and Vial [131], Nash [133]).
It has been known since the early ﬁfties, with the famous prisoner’s dilemma
game, that an equilibrium is usually achieved at the expenses of the social welfare.
In this sense, the computer science community has focused in quantitative aspects of
non-cooperative games, by evaluating the quality of outcomes arising from selﬁsh
behavior. This interest, together with other new research directions in computational
aspects of game theory, has lead to new challenges in this scientiﬁc area, and, in par-
ticular, to the birth of Algorithmic Game Theory (Nisan et al. [134], Papadimitriou
[143]), which collocates at the intersection between computer science, mathematics
and economics.

1 Coping with Selﬁshness in Congestion Games
Efﬁciency Metrics in Non-Cooperative Games
To capture and measure the degradation of social welfare due to selﬁsh behavior,
Koutsoupias and Papadimitriou [113] proposed the coordination ratio, later popu-
larized under the name of price of anarchy (Papadimitriou [143]), which is deﬁned
as the worst-case ratio between the social welfare of a pure Nash equilibrium and
that of an optimal proﬁle which could be enforced if players cooperated (social op-
timum). Other metrics are: (i) the price of stability (Anshelevich et al. [8], Schulz
and Stier-Moses [164]), that is deﬁned as the price of anarchy, but considers the
best-case ratio, and (ii) the competitive ratio of one-round walks starting from the
empty state, deﬁned as the worst-case ratio between the social welfare of a proﬁle
obtained after a process in which players enter the game according to some arbitrary
ordering and greedily choose an irrevocable strategy based on the choices of their
predecessors only and the social optimum.
Congestion Games
The previous metrics have been estimated for several games. Among these, conges-
tion games occupy a preeminent role. In a congestion game (Rosenthal [154]), there
are a ﬁnite set of resources E and a ﬁnite set of players, and each player selects a
set of resources from a collection of subsets of E. The utility that a player gets in a
given strategy proﬁle is equal to the sum of the costs of the resources that she se-
lects, where the cost of each resource is a function (usually called latency function)
that only depends on the number of players using the resource (the resource con-
gestion). Many applications in real-life systems, such as routing on transportation
or computer networks, machine scheduling, resource sharing, group formation and
so on, are suitably modeled by congestion games. As examples, one may think to
web users sharing limited resources (servers, connections, processors and so on),
or drivers who want to move as fast as possible from a location to another along a
road network. Some speciﬁc classes of congestion games have received a particular
attention, because of their wide applicability to several problems coming from com-
puter science and operations research. Among these, the subclass of load balancing
games, in which each player can choose at most one resource, has been largely
investigated. Indeed, load balancing games deﬁne a game-theoretic framework of
machine scheduling problems, in which jobs/tasks (modeled by players) must be
assigned to some machines/servers (modeled by resources).
1.2 How Can We Reduce the Impact of Selﬁshness?
The efﬁciency metrics deﬁned above have been studied intensively in several vari-
ants of congestion games and they have been often shown to be signiﬁcantly high.

1.2 How Can We Reduce the Impact of Selﬁshness?
5
Anyway, in several practical situations, selﬁsh behavior can be partially controlled
by an external authority having the goal of leading the game towards outcomes with
reasonably good social welfare.
Example 1.1. As an example, consider the following problem related to trafﬁc the-
ory, which can be modeled as a congestion game. Suppose that there is a set of n
drivers that, starting from a source s, want to reach a destination t in a road network;
each driver wants to minimize the total travel time, and the travel time of each road is
a non-decreasing function of the number of drivers running trough it, see Figure 1.1.
It is easy to see that, for any d ≥1 and ε > 0, there is a unique pure Nash equilib-
rium in this game, in which all drivers choose the upper road, for a personal cost of
nd. If we measure the social welfare by the sum of the travel time of all players, we
have that the social welfare at equilibrium is equal to nd+1, while simple arguments
of calculus yield that the social optimum is achieved when only
n
d√
d+1 drivers take
the upper road, for a social welfare of nd+1 (d+1) d√
d+1−d
(d+1) d√
d+1 +o(nε). It follows that, by
letting ε going to zero, the price of anarchy (indeed even the price of stability) of
this game becomes
(d+1) d√
d+1
(d+1) d√
d+1−d , which equals 4/3 for d = 1 and grows arbitrarily
large as d increases. For later reference, observe that, for d = 1, the social optimum
is attained when
n
d√
d+1 = n/2 drivers take the upper road.
This game was already considered by Pigou [150], and his studies anticipated vari-
ous concepts of modern game theory. Indeed, it is a representative example of how
selﬁsh players may harm each other.

1(x) = x d
2(x) = n d + 
Fig. 1.1 The Pigou’s network considered in Example 1.1.
In the following, we consider a couple of approaches that one can adopt to guide
players toward better outcomes.
Taxation Mechanisms: A simple way to reduce the price of anarchy in this con-
text is to impose a tax to each driver that runs through a road, thus deﬁning
a taxation mechanism (Pigou [150]). This approach has been also extended to

6
1 Coping with Selﬁshness in Congestion Games
the whole class of congestion games and has been also generalized to other
measures of social welfare and to different behavioral attitudes (for instance,
one may or may not include taxes in the social welfare (non-refundable vs. re-
fundable taxes) and/or consider a different sensitivity of players to taxes). For
general congestion games, a tax can be deﬁned as a function of the game’s struc-
ture, and each player, when selecting a resource, is charged a tax that causes an
increase in her perceived latency, thus guiding all players to reach better out-
comes in terms of social welfare. Furthermore, taxes are applied locally by each
resource, thus deﬁning a decentralized and easily implementable mechanism, in
which each resource is an autonomous computational entity.
With respect to the game deﬁned in Example 1.1, consider the case of d =
1 and a taxation scheme imposing a toll of n/2 on the upper road. By virtue
of this, function f1 becomes f1(x) = x + n/2. Thus, using this road remains
proﬁtable as long as its congestion does not exceed n/2. Hence, in the unique
pure Nash equilibrium of the game, exactly half of the drivers take the upper
road, thus implementing the social optimum. So, we can conclude that there
exists a taxation mechanism inducing a price of anarchy of 1.1
Stackelberg Strategies: Another approach assumes that a central authority is able
to control the strategies of a fraction α ∈(0,1) of the players. The players to be
controlled are chosen by an algorithm called Stackelberg strategy (Roughgar-
den [156]). The application of different Stackelberg strategies has been largely
studied, and the resulting price of anarchy has been estimated as a function of α.
Let us consider again the game deﬁned in Example 1.1, with d = 1. For any
α ∈(0,1), our Stackelberg strategy assigns all controlled αn drivers to the lower
road. Choosing the upper road remains proﬁtable for the remaining (1 −α)n
drivers, thus there is a unique pure Nash equilibrium in which exactly (1−α)n
drivers take the upper road and αn ones take the lower road. This yields a social
welfare of (α2 −α +1)n2, for a price of anarchy of 4
3(α2 −α +1) ∈(1,4/3).
We conclude that this Stackelberg strategy always improves the price of anarchy
and yields optimal performance when α = 1/2.2
All the considered mechanisms operate by changing the rules of the game in some
manner, for instance, by redeﬁning the way in which the players’ utilities are com-
puted (taxation mechanisms), or by restricting the set of available strategies (Stack-
elberg strategies). Furthermore, if one looks at selﬁsh behavior as an adversarial in-
put, these strategies can be interpreted as (minimization) online algorithms, whose
competitiveness corresponds to some efﬁciency metric.
1 The cost produced by taxation is not considered in the deﬁnition of the social welfare. This
approach is referred in the literature as refundable taxes.
2 Indeed, there is a better strategy, obtained by assigning the lower road exactly min{αn,n/2}
drivers, which yields an improved and optimal price of anarchy for any α > 1/2. We choose not to
illustrate this strategy to keep the description simple at these early introductory stages.

1.3 Scope of the Book
Congestion games constitute perhaps the most signiﬁcant class of non-cooperative
games, because of their effectiveness in modeling several real scenarios. Since the
advent of Algorithmic Game Theory, characterizing the inefﬁciency of selﬁsh be-
havior in these games, as well as deﬁning good strategies to reduce it (in the same
spirit of approximation and online algorithms’ design), have stood as fundamental
challenges. In this book, we show how these challenges can be fruitfully addressed
via linear programming and duality theory. In particular, the presented results are
two-fold:
Analysis (Part III): We measure the efﬁciency of selﬁsh behavior in several classes
of congestion games, and we show how this efﬁciency changes when consider-
ing different solution concepts, different types of latency functions (from linear
and polynomial, to very general ones) and how much this efﬁciency eventu-
ally improves after strengthening the combinatorial properties of the considered
games (e.g., when moving from general congestion games to load balancing
games).
Design (Part IV): We resort to taxation mechanisms and Stackelberg strategies to
improve the efﬁciency of almost all games we analyze in Part III. In most of
the cases, we show that the performance of the mechanisms we propose is best
possible within the considered category.
As a byproduct of our exposition, we also cover the analysis and design of efﬁcient
online algorithms for machine scheduling and load balancing problems (Awerbuch
et al. [11]); indeed, the behavior of players entering a game sequentially simulates
the execution of a proper greedy online algorithm.
From a technical point of view, the results we present here are based on the appli-
cation of the primal-dual method (Bil`o [22]). This is a powerful tool suited to prove
good bounds (which are tight in most of the cases) on the performance guarantee of
self-emerging solutions (such as pure Nash equilibria, one-round walks, and some
of their generalizations) in several variants of congestion games. In particular, the
method is based on the construction and analysis of a primal-dual pair of linear
programs, where the dual is used to provide tight (or almost tight) upper bounds
on the performance guarantee, and the primal is used to construct tight (or almost
tight) lower bounds. In certain cases, the primal-dual method is equivalent to the
smoothness framework of Roughgarden [158].
The primal-dual method, since its introduction, has been further explored and
extended by the authors of this book, and has been successfully applied even outside
the realm of congestion games. The results presented here give an overview on how
to apply the method, by focusing on congestion games and some of their variants.

1.4 Organization of the Book
In the following, we summarize the content of all the subsequent book chapters:
Chapter 2: We provide the basic deﬁnitions and notation that will be adopted
throughout the book and give a brief survey of the results related to the per-
formance analysis of congestion games (e.g., in terms of price of anarchy, price
of stability and competitive ratios of one-round walks).
Chapter 3: We describe in detail the primal-dual method. Most of the results pre-
sented in this book are based on the application of this method.
Chapter 4: We analyze the performance of both congestion games and load bal-
ancing games with very general latency functions. In particular, we show that
the performance of load balancing games is as bad as that of general congestion
games, under mild assumptions on the considered latency functions.
Chapter 5: We study ρ-uniform mixed equilibria in congestion games. This stabil-
ity notion, which depends on an integer parameters ρ ≥1, constitutes a sort of
hybridization between the concepts of pure and mixed Nash equilibria. More-
over, it generalizes the notion of pure Nash equilibrium, as 1-uniform mixed
equilibria coincide with pure Nash equilibria. We analyze the performance of
ρ-uniform mixed equilibria in congestion games and quantify their price of an-
archy and price of stability.
Chapter 6: We study the efﬁciency of congestion games with θ-similar strategies:
a model of selﬁsh routing in which the constant length of each route (i.e., the
amount of travel time that is independent of the congestion) is at most θ times
the length of any other one. We provide parametric tight bounds on the price of
anarchy.
Chapter 7: We introduce a continuous variant of one-round walks for congestion
games with general latency functions and provide closed-form tight bounds on
the competitive ratio, holding even for load balancing games. Furthermore, we
instantiate these formulas to the special case of games with polynomial latency
functions.
Chapter 8: We introduce taxation mechanisms for congestion games and discuss
some preliminary results.
Chapter 9: We study the efﬁciency of taxation in congestion games with poly-
nomial latency functions. The presented results show a high beneﬁcial effect
which increases more than linearly with the degree of the latency functions;
furthermore, the structure and analysis of the considered taxes exhibit inter-
esting relationships with some well-studied polynomials in Combinatorics and
Number Theory, such as the Touchard and the Geometric polynomials.
Chapter 10: The results provided in Chapter 9 are extended to the case of general
latency functions, by providing closed-form bounds on their performance under
taxation.
Chapter 11: We analyze the application of three Stackelberg strategies, namely
Largest Latency First, Cover and Scale, to congestion games with afﬁne

latency functions, and we show upper and lower bounds on their worst-case
price of anarchy.
At the end of each chapter, there is a dedicated section in which we discuss the im-
plications of the presented results, and provide connections with the relevant state-
of-the-art.
Some technical proofs are out of the scope of the book and are either omitted or
sketched. To this aim, we often provide the main intuitions on how to prove a result,
without considering all the technical (and possibly tedious) details. The complete
proofs can be found in the research papers discussed in the “Concluding Remarks
and Related Work” sections; furthermore, it becomes an interesting exercise for the
reader to reconstruct the missing proofs.

The Performance of Congestion Games under
Selﬁsh and Greedy Dynamics: A Brief Survey
In this chapter, we provide the main notions and deﬁnitions that are helpful for
understanding the other chapters of the book. Furthermore, we give an overview
of the state-of-the-art concerning the characterization of the efﬁciency of outcomes
generated by selﬁsh and/or greedy dynamics in congestion games (and some of
their variants). For the sake of brevity, the research work covered in some of the
subsequent chapters is not mentioned here.
2.1 Preliminary Notation
We start with some preliminary notation that will be widely used throughout the
book:
• Given two integers 0 ≤k1 ≤k2, deﬁne [k2]k1 := {k1,k1 +1,...,k2 −1,k2} and
[k2] := [k2]1.
• Given two integers i, j, let (i)j denote the falling factorial i(i−1)···(i−j +1).
• For a set A, let χA := A →{0,1} denote the indicator function, i.e., χA(x) = 1
if x ∈A, and χA(x) = 0 otherwise.
• Vectors are generally denoted with bold letters (for instance, xxx = (x1,...,xn)).
• Let 111n and 000n denote the vectors (1,...,1)
|
{z
}
n times
∈Rn
≥0 and (0,...,0)
|
{z
}
n times
∈Rn
≥0, respec-
tively.
• Given two vectors xxx = (x1,...,xn) and yyy = (y1,...,yn), notation xxx ≥yyy means
that xi ≥yi for any i ∈[n]; analogously, xxx > yyy means that xxx ≥yyy and xi > yi for
some i ∈[n].
• Given a set E, let 2E denote the set of all subsets of E.
• := is the assignment operator, i.e., A := B means that B is denoted as A; instead
A = B means that A is equal to B, not by deﬁnition. Anyway, when clear from
the context, and with a little abuse of notation, we may use = in place of := as
assignment operator.

2 The Performance of Congestion Games: A Brief Survey
• In all deﬁnitions having a preﬁx “ε-approximate” or “ε-”, when this preﬁx is
either removed or replaced by the preﬁx “exact”, we are implicitly assuming
that ε = 0.
2.2 Atomic Congestion Games
A congestion game is called atomic when the set of players is ﬁnite, and the contri-
bution of each player to the social welfare may be very signiﬁcant. The following
deﬁnition provides the general model of atomic congestion games, allowing also
different players’ weights.
Deﬁnition 2.1 (Fotakis et al. [91], Rosenthal [154]). A weighted atomic conges-
tion game is a tuple
CG = (N,E,(ℓe)e∈E,(wi)i∈N,(Σi)i∈N),
where:
• N := [n] is a ﬁnite set of n ≥2 players;
• E = [m] is a ﬁnite set of m ≥2 resources;
• ℓe : R>0 →R>0 is the latency function of resource e ∈E, that is assumed to be
non-decreasing and positive1;
• for each i ∈N, wi > 0 is the weight of player i ∈N;
• Σi = {Si,j : j ∈[mi]} ⊆2E \ {/0} is the set of mi strategies available to player
i ∈N.
We extend the domain of the latency functions ℓe to x = 0, by setting ℓe(0) :=
limx→0+ ℓe(x). We speak of weighted games/players when players have arbitrary
weights and of unweighted games/players when wi = 1 for each i ∈N.
Players’ Strategy Space
Interesting special cases of congestion games are obtained by restricting the combi-
natorics of the players’ strategic space.
• A congestion game is symmetric (Christodoulou and Koutsoupias [59], Fab-
rikant et al. [83]) if Σi = Σ j := Σ for each i, j ∈N, i.e., if all players share the
same strategy space, denoted by Σ.
• A load balancing game (or singleton congestion game) (Ackermann et al. [3],
Caragiannis et al. [54], Nisan et al. [134], Suri et al. [170]) is a congestion game
1 All the results obtained in this book can be easily generalized to the case in which some latency
function ℓe veriﬁes ℓe(x) = 0 for some x > 0, but this requires further (tedious) case analysis to
cope with non-deﬁnite ratios of type c/0.

2.2 Atomic Congestion Games
19
in which, for each i ∈N and S ∈Σi, |S| = 1, that is, all players’ strategies are
singleton sets; furthermore, we speak of symmetric load balancing games (or
parallel-link games) if the considered load balancing games are also symmetric,
that is, all players can select all singletons.
• In network congestion games (Fabrikant et al. [83], Nisan et al. [134], Rough-
garden [155]), the strategies of each player i ∈N are all the paths connecting a
source node si with a destination node ti in a given network. If si = s for any
player i ∈N, we speak of single-source network congestion games; if si = s
and ti = t for any player i ∈N, we speak of symmetric network congestion
games; ﬁnally, if si = s and ti = t for any player i ∈N and all (s,t)-paths do
not share any node, except for s and t, we speak of path-disjoint network con-
gestion games. One can easily show that load balancing (resp. symmetric load
balancing) games can be modeled as particular instances of single-source (resp.
path-disjoint) network congestion games.
• In matroid congestion games (Ackermann et al. [3, 4]), the strategy set of ev-
ery player is given by the set of bases of a matroid deﬁned over the set of
available resources; in k-uniform matroid congestion games (de Jong and Uetz
[80], de Jong et al. [81]), each player can select any subset of cardinality k from
a prescribed player-speciﬁc set of resources. We observe that symmetric load
balancing games can be equivalently deﬁned as 1-uniform matroid congestion
games.
In the remainder of the book, we mainly focus on general congestion games or load
balancing games. Given a class C of latency functions, we have that
• W(C) denotes the class of weighted congestion games,
• U(C) denotes the class of unweighted congestion games,
• WLB(C) denotes the class of weighted load balancing games,
• WSLB(C) denotes the class of weighted symmetric load balancing games,
• ULB(C) denotes the class of unweighted load balancing games,
all having latency functions in class C.
Latency Functions
In the following, we list several classes of latency functions that we treat in this
book.
• A congestion game has polynomial latency functions of maximum degree d ∈N
when, for each e ∈E, ℓe(x) = ∑h∈[d]0 αe,h · xh, with αe,h ≥0 for each h ∈[d]0.
When d = 0 we speak of constant latencies, when d = 1, we speak of afﬁne
latencies, and if ℓe(x) = αe,1 · x we speak of linear latencies. Let P(d) denote
the class of polynomial latencies of maximum degree d.
• A latency function f is semi-convex (resp. strictly semi-convex) if function x f(x)
is convex (resp. strictly convex); we observe that polynomial latency functions
are semi-convex.

2 The Performance of Congestion Games: A Brief Survey
• A latency function f is unbounded if limx→∞f(x) = ∞.
• A congestion game has identical resources when all resources have the same
latency function.
• Given a class G of congestion games, let C(G) denote the class of latency func-
tions of congestion games belonging to G.
• A class C of latency function is closed under ordinate scaling (resp. abscissa
scaling) if, for any function f ∈C and α ≥0, the function g such that g(x) =
α f(x) (resp. g(x) = f(αx)) belongs to C.
Strategy Proﬁles and Cost Functions
A (pure) strategy proﬁle is an n-tuple of strategies σσσ = (σ1,...,σn), that is, a
state of the game in which each player i ∈N is adopting strategy σi ∈Σi, so that
ΣΣΣ := ×i∈NΣi denotes the set of strategy proﬁles which can be realized in CG. For a
strategy proﬁle σσσ, the congestion of resource e ∈E in σσσ, denoted as
ke(σσσ) :=
∑
i∈N:e∈σi
wi,
is the total weight of the players using resource e in σσσ, while the number of users of
resource e in σσσ is denoted as ne(σσσ) := |{i ∈N : e ∈σi}|. The cost of player i in σσσ
is deﬁned as
ci(σσσ) = ∑
e∈σi
ℓe(ke(σσσ))
(equivalently denoted as costi(σσσ)) and each player aims at minimizing it. For the
sake of conciseness, when the strategy proﬁle σσσ is clear from the context, we will
often write ke and ne in place of ke(σσσ) and ne(σσσ).
We also treat the notion of mixed strategy proﬁles (Nash [133]), which constitute
a probabilistic extension of pure ones. Let
∆i =
(
yyyi = (yi, j) j∈[mi] ∈Rmi
≥0 : ∑
j∈mi
yi, j = 1
)
be the set of probability distributions deﬁned over Σi, so that yi,j denotes the proba-
bility for player i to choose strategy Si,j. A mixed strategy proﬁle yyy = (yyy1,yyy2,...,yyyn)
is a state in which each player i ∈N picks her strategy according to probability distri-
bution yyyi ∈∆i, independently from the choices of the other players. Let ∆∆∆= ×i∈N∆i
be the set of all mixed strategy proﬁles. Given yyy ∈∆∆∆, denote with
E[ke(yyy)] = ∑
i∈N
∑
j∈[mi]:e∈Si,j
wiyi, j
the expected congestion of resource e according to yyy, and with

2.2 Atomic Congestion Games
21
E[ne(yyy)] = ∑
i∈N
∑
j∈[mi]:e∈Si,j
yi,j
the expected number of users of e according to yyy. Note that each strategy proﬁle
is also a mixed one and that, whenever a mixed strategy proﬁle yyy coincides with
the strategy proﬁle σσσ, we have E[ke(yyy)] = ke(σσσ) and E[ne(yyy)] = ne(σσσ). The cost of
player i in a mixed proﬁle yyy is deﬁned as
ci(yyy) := Eσσσ∼yyy[ci(σσσ)],
i.e., it is the expected cost of player i with respect to strategy proﬁles distributed
according to yyy.
The more general notion of randomized strategy proﬁles (Aumann [10], Moulin
and Vial [131]) can be obtained by relaxing the independence between the play-
ers’ random choices, and are deﬁned as arbitrary probability distributions over pure
strategy proﬁles.
Social Functions
The quality of a strategy proﬁle in congestion games is measured by means of a
social function. The following two social functions are usually used in weighted
congestion games: the total latency (or sum of all latencies), deﬁned as
TL(σσσ) = ∑
i∈N
ci(σσσ) = ∑
e∈E
ne(σσσ)ℓe(ke(σσσ))
and the weighted total latency (or weighted sum of all latencies), deﬁned as
WTL(σσσ) = ∑
i∈N
wici(σσσ) = ∑
e∈E
ke(σσσ)ℓe(ke(σσσ)).
Clearly, by deﬁnition, these two measures coincide in unweighted games, and for
the sake of simplicity, we either adopt both WTL and TL as acronyms for the total
latency in unweighted games, or we adopt the acronym SUM.
Moreover, observe that, for polynomial latencies, TL(σσσ) = ∑e∈E ∑h∈[d]0 αe,hnekh
e
and WTL(σσσ) = ∑e∈E ∑h∈[d]0 αe,hkh+1
e
. Other social functions are the maximum cost,
deﬁned as
MAX(σσσ) = max
i∈N ci(σσσ),
and the Lp-norm of the total latency, deﬁned as
TLp(σσσ) =
p
r
∑
e∈E
ℓe(ke(σσσ))p.

22
2 The Performance of Congestion Games: A Brief Survey
The results presented in this book are mainly related to social functions TL and
WTL. In particular, when the social function is not speciﬁed, we implicitly refer to
the total latency when the game is unweighted, and to the weighted total latency
when the game is weighted.
For a ﬁxed social function SF, a social optimum is a strategy proﬁle σσσ∗minimiz-
ing SF. For the sake of conciseness, once a particular social optimum has been ﬁxed,
we will often write oe and n∗
e to denote the values ke(σσσ∗) and ne(σσσ∗), respectively.
2.3 Solution Concepts
In unweighted congestion games, selﬁsh behavior always leads to stable outcomes,
called pure Nash equilibria (Nash [133]), in which each player cannot improve her
utility by unilaterally deviating from her strategy. Besides pure Nash equilibria, in
the setting of atomic congestion games, the notion of one-round walks starting from
the empty state has been widely investigated due to its simplicity and effectiveness.
This concept assumes that, starting from the situation in which no strategy has been
speciﬁed yet, the players are processed sequentially and, at each iteration, the se-
lected player irrevocably chooses her strategy so as to minimize her cost based on
the choices of the previous ones. In the following, we formally describe these two
solution concepts.
Pure Nash Equilibrium and Generalizations
Fix a strategy proﬁle σσσ and a player i ∈N. We denote with σσσ−i the restriction of σσσ
to all players other than i; moreover, for a strategy S ∈Σi, we denote with (σσσ−i,S)
the strategy proﬁle obtained from σσσ when player i changes her strategy from σi to
S, while the strategies of all the other players are kept ﬁxed.
Deﬁnition 2.2 (Nash [133]). A pure Nash equilibrium is a strategy proﬁle σσσ such
that, for any player i ∈N and strategy S ∈Σi, ci(σσσ) ≤ci(σσσ−i,S), that is, an outcome
of the game in which no player can improve her situation by unilaterally deviating
to another strategy.
By relaxing this requirement, one obtains the notion of ε-approximate pure Nash
equilibrium as follows.
Deﬁnition 2.3. For any ε ≥0, an ε-approximate pure Nash equilibrium is a strat-
egy proﬁle σσσ such that, for any player i ∈N and strategy S ∈Σi, ci(σσσ) ≤(1 +
ε)ci(σσσ−i,S).
We denote by NEε(CG) the set of ε-approximate pure Nash equilibria of a conges-
tion game CG.

2.3 Solution Concepts
23
A canonical way to show the existence of (approximate) pure Nash equilibria is
by means of a potential function (Monderer and Shapley [128], Rosenthal [154]).
More precisely, given a (congestion) game SG, a function Φ : ΣΣΣ →R≥0 is called
• an ordinal potential if, for any strategy proﬁle σσσ ∈ΣΣΣ, player i ∈N and strategy
S ∈Σi, it holds that sgn(Φ(σσσ)−Φ(σσσ−i,S)) = sgn(ci(σσσ)−ci(σσσ−i,S));
• a weighted potential if, for any player i ∈N, there exists a weight νi > 0 such
that for any strategy proﬁle σσσ ∈ΣΣΣ and strategy S ∈Σi, it holds that Φ(σσσ) −
Φ(σσσ−i,S) = νi (ci(σσσ)−ci(σσσ−i,S));
• an exact potential if for any strategy proﬁle σσσ ∈ΣΣΣ, player i ∈N and strategy
S ∈Σi, it holds that Φ(σσσ)−Φ(σσσ−i,S) = ci(σσσ)−ci(σσσ−i,S).
Clearly, by deﬁnition, exact potentials are special cases of weighted potentials,
which, in turn, are special cases of ordinal ones. The existence of an ordinal po-
tential function implies that any dynamics in which each player decreases her cost
by deviating to other strategies converges to a pure Nash equilibrium after a ﬁnite
number of steps, since the set of all strategy proﬁles is ﬁnite.
Rosenthal [154] shows that any unweighted congestion game admits an exact
potential function, deﬁned as
Φ(σσσ) = ∑
e∈E
ke(σσσ)
∑
i=1
ℓe(i).
Conversely, Monderer and Shapley [128] show that any game admitting an exact
potential function is equivalent to a congestion game. The works of Fotakis et al.
[91], Harks [100], Panagopoulou and Spirakis [142], and Harks and Klimm [101]
have shown that pure Nash equilibria are always guaranteed to exist in weighted
congestion games if and only if the latency functions are either afﬁne or exponential.
As to approximate equilibria, Caragiannis et al. [55] show that weighted conges-
tion games with polynomial latencies of maximum degree d always admit an O(d!)-
approximate pure Nash equilibrium; this result has been further improved by Cara-
giannis and Fanelli [51], who show the existence of O(d)-approximate pure Nash
equilibria. In contrast, Christodoulou et al. [66] show that Ω(
√
d)-approximate
equilibria might not exist for certain weighted congestion games with polynomial
latencies of maximum degree d.
Several generalizations of (approximate) pure Nash equilibria have been pro-
posed in the literature (Aumann [10], Moulin and Vial [131], Nash [133]). Here, we
present their approximate variants.
Deﬁnition 2.4. An ε-approximate mixed Nash equilibrium is a mixed strategy pro-
ﬁle yyy ∈∆∆∆such that, for any player i ∈N and strategy S ∈Σi,
Eσσσ∼yyy[ci(σσσ)] ≤(1+ε)Eσσσ∼yyy[ci(σσσ−i,S)].
Deﬁnition 2.5. An ε-approximate correlated equilibrium is a probability distribu-
tion ppp deﬁned over the set of strategy proﬁles ΣΣΣ (that is, a randomized strategy
proﬁle) such that, for any player i ∈N and pair of strategies S,S′ ∈Σi,

24
2 The Performance of Congestion Games: A Brief Survey
Eσσσ∼ppp[ci(σσσ)|σi = S′] ≤(1+ε)Eσσσ∼ppp[ci(σσσ−i,S)|σi = S′].
Deﬁnition 2.6. an ε-approximate coarse correlated equilibrium is a probability dis-
tribution ppp deﬁned over ΣΣΣ such that, for any player i ∈N and strategy S ∈Σi,
Eσσσ∼ppp[ci(σσσ)] ≤(1+ε)Eσσσ∼ppp[ci(σσσ−i,S)].
We can easily observe that every ε-pure Nash equilibrium is an ε-approximate
mixed Nash equilibrium, every ε-approximate mixed Nash equilibrium is an ε-
approximate correlated equilibrium, and every ε-approximate correlated equilib-
rium is an ε-approximate coarse correlated equilibrium.
By Nash’s celebrated theorem (Nash [133]), mixed/correlated/coarse correlated
Nash equilibria are always guaranteed to exist in weighted congestion games for
any ε ≥0. Moreover, correlated equilibria (and so also coarse correlated ones) can
be efﬁciently computed, as shown by Papadimitriou and Roughgarden [144].
We have previously stated that pure Nash equilibria are always guaranteed to
exist for subsets of weighted congestion games by resorting to a potential function
argument. However, the problem of ﬁnding a pure Nash equilibrium in these games
is computationally hard. Indeed, Fabrikant et al. [83] show that computing a pure
Nash equilibrium is a PLS-complete problem (and this holds even for unweighted
congestion games with afﬁne latencies, as shown by Ackermann et al. [3]). The
problem becomes polynomial when restricting the players’ strategic space (e.g., to
single-source network congestion games (Fabrikant et al. [83]), or to matroid con-
gestion games (Ackermann et al. [3])).
For such a reason, less demanding deterministic solution concepts have been
investigated in the literature, such as the notion of one-round walk introduced by
Mirrokni and Vetta [127] which we explain in the following.
One-round Walk Starting From the Empty State
The Case of Selﬁsh Players
For any ε ≥0, a strategy S∗∈Σi is an ε-approximate best-response for player i
in σσσ−i if, for each S ∈Σi, ci(σσσ−i,S∗) ≤(1 + ε)ci(σσσ−i,S). With a little abuse of
notation, we extend the set ΣΣΣ of strategy proﬁles so as to include also the cases in
which some players have not chosen their strategies yet; in particular, we denote
with /0/0/0 the empty state, that is, the strategy proﬁle in which none of the players has
chosen a strategy.
Deﬁnition 2.7 (Mirrokni and Vetta [127]). An ε-approximate one-round walk
starting from the empty state (involving selﬁsh players) is an (n+1)-tuple of strategy
proﬁles
τττ = (σσσ0,σσσ1,σσσ2,...,σσσn),

2.3 Solution Concepts
25
such that σσσ0 = /0/0/0 and, for each i ∈N, σσσi = (σσσi−1
−i ,S∗), where S∗is an ε-approximate
best-response for player i in σσσi−1
−i . The strategy proﬁle σσσn is the strategy proﬁle
generated by τττ.
The above deﬁnition is an approximate variant of the solution concept introduced
by Mirrokni and Vetta [127]. The strategy proﬁle generated by τττ can be seen as the
result of the process in which players enter the game sequentially and the ith player
performs an irrevocable choice by approximately best-responding to the choices of
the ﬁrst i−1 players.
To highlight the connection between the concept of one-round walk and the typ-
ical concepts of equilibrium in game theory, the notion of one-round walk has been
equivalently deﬁned as myopic best-response equilibrium (see, for instance, Hey-
denreich et al. [103]): indeed, a one round-walk can be seen as a process in which
all players, in turn, select their best strategy without taking into account the behav-
ior of the players which have not entered the game yet, i.e. players are myopic. A
similar behavior in which each player entering the game is not myopic, but chooses
her strategy taking also into account the strategic behavior of the players which
have not entered the game yet, is captured by the well-known concept of subgame
perfect equilibrium (Osborne [136]), whose performance has been studied in sev-
eral works (see, for instance, Bil`o et al. [33], Correa et al. [76], de Jong and Uetz
[80], Paes Leme et al. [141]).
The Case of Cooperative Players
In Deﬁnition 2.7, if S∗is a strategy such that WTL(σσσi−1
−i ,S∗) −WTL(σσσi−1) ≤
(1 + ε)(WTL(σσσi−1
−i ,S) −WTL(σσσi−1)) for any S ∈Σi, then τττ is an ε-approximate
one-round walk starting from the empty state involving cooperative players2. This
cooperative version of one-round walks, despite being not meaningful when as-
suming selﬁsh players, is signiﬁcant in the context of online algorithms, since the
greedy-algorithm obtained by simulating a one-round walk has been used to solve
efﬁciently the online load balancing problem (Awerbuch et al. [11], Caragiannis
[48], Caragiannis et al. [54]) (for further details, see Section 2.6).
We denote by ORWs
ε(CG) (resp. ORWc
ε(CG)) the set of strategy proﬁles which
can be constructed by an ε-approximate one-round walk involving selﬁsh (resp.
cooperative) players in a congestion game CG.
2 An alternative deﬁnition for the concept of ε-approximate one-round walk involving cooperative
players can be obtained by assuming that the ith player aims at minimizing the value of the so-
cial function, i.e., WTL(σσσi) ≤(1 + ε)minS∈Σi WTL(σσσi−1
−i ,S). For ε = 0 the two deﬁnitions are
equivalent; for ε > 0, the proof arguments that we are going to use in this book can be easily
adapted/modiﬁed to get similar results holding under this alternative deﬁnition as well.

2.4 Efﬁciency Metrics
In general, all solution concepts described above do not yield an optimal social
welfare, and several metrics have been proposed to measure the inefﬁciency of these
outcomes. All the metrics we consider here vary in the range [1,∞], in such a way
that, the higher their value, the more inefﬁcient the outcome (with respect to the
considered solution concept and social function). In particular, if the adopted metric
gets value 1, the outcomes of the game are optimal (in terms of social welfare).
Price of Anarchy and Price of Stability
The most important metrics used to measure the inefﬁciency of Nash equilibria are
the price of anarchy (Koutsoupias and Papadimitriou [113]) and the price of stability
(Anshelevich et al. [8]). We give a formal deﬁnition for these metrics, holding for
general ε-approximate pure Nash equilibria.
Deﬁnition 2.8 (Koutsoupias and Papadimitriou [113]). The ε-approximate pure
price of anarchy of a weighted congestion game CG with respect to the social func-
tion SF ∈{TL,WTL} is deﬁned as
PoAε(CG) :=
max
σσσ∈NEε(CG)
SF(σσσ)
SF(σσσ∗),
(2.1)
where σσσ∗is a social optimum for CG with respect to the social function SF. Given
a class of congestion games G, the ε-approximate pure price of anarchy of class G
is deﬁned as PoA(G) := supCG∈G PoA(CG).
Deﬁnition 2.9 (Anshelevich et al. [8]). The ε-approximate pure price of stability of
a weighted congestion game CG with respect to the social function SF ∈{TL,WTL}
is deﬁned as
PoSε(CG) :=
min
σσσ∈NEε(CG)
SF(σσσ)
SF(σσσ∗),
(2.2)
where σσσ∗is a social optimum for CG with respect to the social function SF. Given
a class of congestion games G, the ε-approximate pure price of stability of class G
is deﬁned as PoS(G) := supCG∈G PoS(CG).
By letting σσσ varying among the set of ε-approximate mixed Nash equilibria,
ε-approximate correlated equilibria and ε-approximate coarse correlated equilib-
ria, one respectively obtains the ε-approximate mixed price of anarchy, the ε-
approximate correlated price of anarchy and the ε-approximate coarse correlated
price of anarchy, with respect to social function SF. Analogously, one can deﬁne
the ε-approximate mixed/correlated/coarse correlated price of stability.
Informally, the price of anarchy of a game is deﬁned as the worst-case ratio be-
tween the social value of an equilibrium and the optimal social value, and measures

2.5 Non-atomic Congestion Games
27
the impact of selﬁsh behavior when players are completely uncoordinated. Instead,
the price of stability is deﬁned as the best-case ratio between the above quantities,
and then assumes that there is a partial coordination among the players, who are
able to reach the best equilibrium conﬁguration.
In all the chapters of this book, we assume without loss of generality that each
considered class of latency functions contains at least a non-constant latency func-
tion.3
Competitive Ratio of One-round Walks
In the same spirit of online optimization, we adopt the competitive ratio as a bench-
mark measure for the performance of strategy proﬁles generated by one-round
walks.
Deﬁnition 2.10. The competitive ratio of ε-approximate one-round walks generated
by selﬁsh (resp. cooperative) players of a weighted congestion game CG with respect
to the social function SF ∈{TL,WTL} is deﬁned as
CRx
ε(CG) =
max
σσσ∈ORWxε(CG)
SF(σσσ)
SF(σσσ∗),
(2.3)
where x = s for selﬁsh players (resp. x = c for cooperative players), and σσσ∗is a
social optimum for CG with respect to the social function SF. Given a class of
congestion games G, the competitive ratio of ε-approximate one-round walks of
class G is deﬁned as CRx
ε(G) = supCG∈G CRx
ε(CG).
Similarly to the price of anarchy and the price of stability, the competitive ratio
measures the inefﬁciency of the outcomes generated by players who greedily select
their approximate best-responses.
2.5 Non-atomic Congestion Games
The counterpart of the class of atomic games is that of non-atomic congestion games
(Beckmann et al. [17], Pigou [150], Wardrop [178]): these games constitute a good
approximation for atomic congestion games when players become inﬁnitely many
and the contribution of each player to the social welfare becomes inﬁnitesimally
small.
3 Indeed, if it were not the case (i.e., if all the latency functions were constant) there would be no
interactions between players, and each player would be trivially able to minimize her cost up to a
factor (1+ε), independently from the choices of the others. This results in a social value equal to
at most (1+ε) times the optimal one, and this upper bound is trivially tight.

28
2 The Performance of Congestion Games: A Brief Survey
Deﬁnition 2.11 (Beckmann et al. [17], Pigou [150], Wardrop [178]). A non-
atomic congestion game is a tuple
NCG = (N,E,(ℓe)e∈E,(ri)i∈N,(Σi)i∈N),
where
• N := [n] is a ﬁnite set of n ≥1 types of players, and E := [m] is a ﬁnite set of
m ≥2 resources;
• ℓe : R>0 →R>0 is the latency function of resource e ∈E, which is assumed to be
non-decreasing, positive, and continuous4 (again, we set ℓe(0) := limx→0+ ℓe(x));
• ri ∈R≥0 is the amount of players of type i ∈N;
• Σi = {Si,1,...,Si,mi} ⊆2E \{/0} is the set of strategies of a player of type i, that
is, each player of type i has mi ≥1 possible choices.
As in the atomic case, we can deﬁne the concepts of strategy proﬁle, cost function,
and total latency.
A (pure) strategy proﬁle is a tuple σσσ := (σi,S)i∈N,S∈Σi with ∑S∈Σi σi,S = ri for any
i ∈N, that is a state of the game where σi,S ≥0 is the total amount of players of type
i selecting strategy S for any i ∈N and S ∈Σi. Given a strategy proﬁle σσσ,
ke(σσσ) :=
∑
i∈N,S∈Σi:e∈S
σi,S
is the congestion of e in σσσ, i.e., the total amount of players selecting e in σσσ, and
given a strategy S,
cS(σσσ) := ∑
e∈S
ℓe(ke(σσσ))
is the cost of players selecting S in σσσ. A social function usually used as a measure of
the quality of a strategy proﬁle in non-atomic congestion games is the total latency,
deﬁned as
TL(σσσ) =
∑
i∈N,S∈Σi
σi,S ·cS(σσσ) = ∑
e∈E
ke(σσσ)·ℓe(ke(σσσ)).
All the other deﬁnitions given in Section 2.2 for atomic congestion games (e.g.,
load balancing games, games with polynomial latency functions), naturally extend
to non-atomic ones. Given a class C of latency functions, let N(C) be the class of
non-atomic congestion games having latency functions in C, and let NLB(C) ⊂(C)
be the related subclass of load balancing games.
As in the atomic case, pure Nash equilibria are considered as synonymous of
stability in non-atomic congestion games. In the following deﬁnition, we consider
the approximate variant of pure Nash equilibria.
4 The property of continuity is well-motivated by most of the real-life scenarios modeled by non-
atomic congestion games. Anyway, the results provided in this book hold even under the weaker
assumption of right-continuity.

2.6 Load Balancing with Unrelated Machines
29
Deﬁnition 2.12 (Nash [133], Wardrop [178]). An ε-approximate pure Nash equi-
librium is a strategy proﬁle σσσ such that, for any player i ∈N, strategy S ∈Σi such
that σi,S > 0 and strategy S′, cS(σσσ) ≤cS′(σσσ) holds, that is, an outcome of the game
in which no player can improve her situation by unilaterally deviating to another
strategy.
In the literature of selﬁsh routing, exact pure Nash equilibria (in non-atomic games)
are often called Wardrop equilibria or equilibrium ﬂows. As for atomic games, non-
atomic congestion games always admit an exact pure Nash equilibrium, but in the
non-atomic case, (exact) pure Nash equilibria are unique up to strategy proﬁles hav-
ing the same value of the latency functions for any resource. Indeed, Beckmann
et al. [17] prove that a strategy proﬁle σσσ is a pure Nash equilibrium if and only if it
is a local minimum of the potential function
Φ(σσσ) := ∑
e∈E
Z ke(σσσ)
0
ℓe(t)dt.
Since Φ(σσσ) is convex over a compact and convex domain, it admits a global min-
imum, thus at least a Nash equilibrium exists. Furthermore, because of convexity,
all local minima are global minima, and the value of the latency function of each
resource does not depend on the particular equilibrium.
The notions of ε-approximate prices of anarchy and stability given in Section 2.4
naturally extend to non-atomic congestion games.
2.6 Load Balancing with Unrelated Machines
A class of optimization problems, whose game-theoretic interpretation is strictly
connected to congestion games and load balancing games, is that of load balancing
problems with unrelated machines.5
Deﬁnition 2.13 (Awerbuch et al. [11]). A load balancing instance with unrelated
machines is a tuple LB = (I,J,(wij)i∈I, j∈J) such that I is a set of m machines and
wij ∈[0,∞] is the weight of job j when assigned to machine i.
By strengthening Deﬁnition 2.13, we get several interesting classes of load balanc-
ing instances:
• if each weight wij is deﬁned as wj/si, where wj ≥0 is the weight of job j (not
depending on the selected machine) and si > 0 is the speed of machine i, we get
a load balancing instance with related machines;
5 For the general model of load balancing considered in this section, we use a partially different
notation with respect to that used for (load balancing) congestion games, and we adopt a notation
that is commonly used in the ﬁeld of machine scheduling. Anyway, in the remainder of the book,
it will be clear which model of load balancing (and related notation) we are considering; further-
more, this general model of load balancing will be treated in the “Related Work” section of this
Chapter and in Section 4.4, only.

30
2 The Performance of Congestion Games: A Brief Survey
• if wij can be equal either to ∞or to wj/si, we get a linear load balancing
instance with related machines and restricted assignments;
• if wij can be equal either to ∞or to wj, we get a load balancing instance with
identical machines.
A feasible assignment is a n-uple σσσ = (σ1,σ2,...,σn) such that σσσ j ∈I (i.e.,
i := σσσ j is the machine which job j ∈J has been assigned under σσσ), and wσj, j ̸= ∞
for any j ∈J (i.e., a job cannot be assigned to a machine for which its weight is ∞).
Given i ∈I,
wi(σσσ) = ∑
j∈Ji(σσσ)
wij
is the load of machine i under assignment σσσ, where Ji(σσσ) := { j ∈J : σj = i} denotes
the set of jobs assigned to machine i in σσσ. In the context of machine scheduling, the
load of a machine i in σσσ models the time needed to complete all the jobs assigned
to i (in σσσ).
The (ofﬂine) load balancing problem consists in ﬁnding a feasible assignment
σσσ minimizing a total load function SF(σσσ) which is non-decreasing in each load
wi(σσσ). In the online linear load balancing problem, each job j arrives online, and
should be irrevocably assigned to some machine i with the aim of minimizing as
much as possible SF and without knowing the characteristics of the jobs related to
future arrivals.
Commonly studied total load functions are:
• the makespan (or L∞-norm of the total load), deﬁned as TL∞(σσσ) = maxi∈I wi(σσσ);
• the Lp norm of the total load, deﬁned as TLp(σσσ) =
pq
∑i∈I wp
i (σσσ) for some
p ≥1;
• as a generalization of the Lp norm of the total load, we have the f-weighted
total load, deﬁned as WTL f (σσσ) = ∑i∈I wi(σσσ)f(wi(σσσ)) for a given increasing
function f : R≥0 →R≥0 with f(0) = 0; we observe that, if f is a monomial of
degree p, the f-weighted total load coincides with the (p −1)th power of the
Lp−1 norm.
A classic online algorithm used for this problem is the greedy algorithm (Awer-
buch et al. [11], Graham [98]): each time a job arrives, this algorithm assigns it to
the machine causing the lowest increase in function SF.
By considering a game-theoretic version of the previous optimization problems,
we obtain load balancing games with unrelated machines: each job j is associated
to a selﬁsh player who can choose a machine i which j should be assigned to, with
the aim of minimizing the load wi(σσσ) of the machine i = σj she chooses. As in
congestion games, such a selﬁsh behavior leads to pure Nash equilibria, i.e. stable
outcomes in which no player can reduce her completion time up to a factor 1+ε by
unilaterally deviating in favor of another machine.
Observe that load balancing games with related machines can be modeled as
symmetric weighted load balancing games (Section 2.2), and load balancing games
with related machines and restricted assignments can be modeled as more general
weighted load balancing games. Analogously to Section 2.2, one can deﬁne for

these games the solution concepts of ε-approximate pure Nash equilibria and ε-
approximate one-round walks, and the efﬁciency metrics of ε-approximate prices of
anarchy and stability, and the competitive ratio of ε-approximate one round walks.
Observe that the greedy algorithm deﬁned above can be obtained by simulating the
cooperative one-round walk.

In this section, we give a brief overview of the state-of-the-art in congestion games
and their performance analysis, as it is strongly related to the results presented in this
book. Furthermore, we also provide some relevant references in the ﬁelds of ofﬂine
and online optimization for load balancing and other resource selection problems,
since part of our ﬁndings can be applied to these contexts.
Price of Anarchy and Price of Stability
Atomic Games
The price of anarchy in (atomic) congestion games was ﬁrst considered by Awer-
buch et al. [12] and Christodoulou and Koutsoupias [59], who independently show
that the price of anarchy is 5/2 in unweighted games with afﬁne latency functions.
Christodoulou and Koutsoupias [59] also prove that better bounds are not possible
in both symmetric unweighted games and unweighted network games; these results
were improved by Correa et al. [76] who show that the price of anarchy stays the
same even in symmetric unweighted network games. Furthermore, Awerbuch et al.
[12] additionally show that the price of anarchy of weighted congestion games with
afﬁne latency functions is (3+
√
5)/2.
Caragiannis et al. [54] show that the previous bounds are tight also for load bal-
ancing games. For the special case of load balancing games on identical resources,
the works of Suri et al. [170] and Caragiannis et al. [54] imply that the price of
anarchy is 2.012067 for unweighted games and at least 5/2 for weighted ones.
Paccagnan et al. [140] and Ravindran Vijayalakshmi and Skopalik [152] show how
to obtain tight bounds for the price of anarchy of unweighted games with identical
resource having polynomial latencies, and they provide some numerical values for
the ﬁrst degrees.
In L¨ucking et al. [120], it is proved that, for symmetric load balancing games, the
price of anarchy drops to 4/3 in unweighted games, and to 9/8 in weighted games
with identical resources. This last result has been generalised by Gairing et al. [93]
who provide tight bounds on the price of anarchy of symmetric weighted load bal-
ancing games with identical resources and monomial latency functions. For sym-
metric unweighted k-uniform matroid congestion games with afﬁne latency func-

tions, de Jong et al. [81] prove that the price of anarchy is at most 28/13 and at least
1.343 for a sufﬁciently large value of k (for k = 5, it is roughly 1.3428).
Tight bounds of Θ

on the price of anarchy of either weighted and
unweighted congestion games with polynomial latency functions have been given
by Aland et al. [7].6 Under fairly general latency functions, Fotakis [88] shows that
the price of anarchy of unweighted symmetric load balancing games coincides with
that of non-atomic congestion games, while Bhawalkar et al. [20] prove that assum-
ing symmetric strategies does not lead to improved bounds in unweighted games and
give exact bounds for the case of weighted players. It also shown that, for the case of
weighted players, no improvements are possible even in symmetric load balancing
games with monomial and polynomial latency functions. Gairing and Schoppmann
[92] and Gairing et al. [93, 94] provide upper and lower bounds on the pure and
mixed price of anarchy for several classes of load balancing games with polynomial
latency functions. Finally, Christodoulou et al. [61] (resp. Bil`o [22]) provide tight
bounds (resp. almost tight upper bounds) on the approximate price of anarchy of
unweighted (resp. weighted) congestion games under afﬁne latency functions. Gi-
annakopoulos et al. [95] have recently obtained tight bounds on the approximate
price of anarchy of congestion games with polynomial latency functions, holding
even for load balancing games; prior to this work, analogue results were obtained
by Bil`o and Vinci [24].
Roughgarden [158] characterizes the price of anarchy for unweighted congestion
games having general non-decreasing latency functions and proves that the price of
anarchy of congestion games under pure Nash equilibria is as high as that under
mixed/correlated/coarse correlated Nash equilibria. This last result is extended to
weighted games by Bhawalkar et al. [20] and to approximate equilibria and even
non-decreasing latency functions by Bil`o [42]. Roughgarden [157] investigates the
quality of Nash equilibria in congestion games with incomplete informations.
Relatively to the price of stability, Christodoulou and Koutsoupias [60] give a
lower bound of 1 +
1
√
3 for afﬁne unweighted congestion games, and Caragiannis
et al. [54] prove that this bound is tight. Christodoulou and Gairing [67] prove a
tight bound of Θ(p) on the price of stability for polynomial latency functions of
maximum degree p, which is, thus, asymptotically better than the corresponding
price of anarchy. In contrast, Christodoulou et al. [65] show that, for weighted games
and polynomial latencies, the price of stability is asymptotically close to the price of
anarchy. Christodoulou et al. [61] and Bil`o [22] give bounds for the ε-approximate
price of stability of afﬁne unweighted and weighted congestion games respectively.
Anshelevich et al. [8] show that the price of stability of load balancing games under
fairly general latency functions, coincides with the price of anarchy of non-atomic
congestion games having the same latency functions. The price of stability has been
widely investigated in congestion games with non-increasing latency functions (e.g.,
6 For the sake of conciseness, most of the bounds related to polynomial latency functions are
represented via their asymptotic growth (in the maximum degree of the considered polynomials).

chy and price of stability discussed in this subsection.
Non-atomic Games
Roughgarden and Tardos [160] prove that the price of anarchy of non-atomic con-
gestion games with afﬁne latency functions is 4/3. Roughgarden [155] extends this
result to polynomial latency functions of degree p, and shows that the price of an-
archy, in this case, is Θ

functions (by providing closed-form bounds), and show that this is tight for simple
Pigou’s networks (i.e., symmetric games with two resources). Christodoulou et al.
[61] give tight bounds on the ε-approximate price of anarchy and stability for con-
gestion games with polynomial latency functions.

2 The Performance of Congestion Games: A Brief Survey
Approximate Social Optima and pure Nash Equilibria via the Price of Anarchy
The work on the quantiﬁcation of the price of anarchy for certain classes of con-
gestion games has also inﬂuenced the design of efﬁcient algorithms for computing
either approximate social optima or approximate pure Nash equilibria. Awerbuch
et al. [13] resort to certain best-response dynamics applied to certain potential games
(including polynomial unweighted and linear weighted congestion games), with the
aim of computing some ε-approximate variants of pure Nash equilibria (where ε > 0
can be arbitrarily chosen); by using the deﬁnition of the price of anarchy, they show
that such equilibria guarantee a social welfare of at most β + ε times the social
optimum, where β is the price of anarchy of the input game.
By exploiting similar best-response dynamics, Caragiannis et al. [53] compute
(α + ε)-approximate equilibria in afﬁne and polynomial congestion games, where
α is the price of anarchy of a game connected to the input one; in particular, they
provide polynomial-time algorithms to compute (2 + ε)-approximate (resp. pO(p)-
approximate) equilibria for afﬁne (resp. polynomial) unweighted congestion games.
By using a similar machinery, Caragiannis et al. [55] provide similar approximation
guarantees for weighted games, and Ravindran Vijayalakshmi and Skopalik [152]
provide better approximation factors for unweighted ones. Other results on existence
and computation of approximate equilibria have been also achieved by Caragiannis
and Fanelli [51], Christodoulou et al. [66], Giannakopoulos et al. [95], Hansknecht
et al. [99].
Atomic Games with Splittable Flow
An interesting variant of congestion games is that of atomic congestion games with
splittable ﬂow, in which each player has an amount of ﬂow she controls which can
be split among her strategies. As the ﬂow is splittable, this class of games exhibits
several similarities with its non-atomic counterpart. Cominetti et al. [74], Harks
[100] and Roughgarden and Schoppmann [162] have studied the price of anarchy
of atomic games with splittable ﬂow; in particular, Roughgarden and Schoppmann
[162] provide a tight bound for general latency functions which equals Θ(p)
p+1

for
the particular case of polynomial latencies of maximum degree p.
One-round Walk Starting From the Empty State
The competitive ratio of exact one-round walks generated by cooperative players in
weighted load balancing games with polynomial latency functions has been implic-
itly considered by Awerbuch et al. [11], who analyzed the performance of the online
greedy algorithm under the Lp-norm. Their results directly imply an upper bound of
3 + 2
√
2 for the special case of afﬁne functions, and an upper bound of Θ(p)p for
general polynomial latencies. For unweighted players, the result for afﬁne functions
has been improved to 17/3 by Suri et al. [170], who also show that, for identical

2.7 Related Work
35
resources, the upper bound drops to 2+
√
5 in spite of a lower bound of 3.0833. Fi-
nally, Caragiannis et al. [54] show matching lower bounds of 3+2
√
2 and 17/3 for,
respectively, weighted and unweighted players with afﬁne latencies. For weighted
games with polynomial latency functions, a tight bound of Θ(p)p is directly im-
plied by Caragiannis [49]; the lower bounds, in particular, hold even for identical
resources, thus improving previous results from Awerbuch et al. [11]. Caragiannis
et al. [54] also show that, for unweighted players and identical resources, the com-
petitive ratio lies between 4 and 2
3
√
21+1 if the latency functions are afﬁne.
For the case of selﬁsh players and still under afﬁne latency functions, Bil`o et al.
[31] and Christodoulou et al. [63] show that the competitive ratio is 2 +
√
5 for
unweighted congestion games, while, for weighted players, Christodoulou et al.
[63] give an upper bound of 4 + 2
√
3. For the more general case of polynomial
latency functions, Bil`o and Vinci [24] and Klimm et al. [110] determine explicit and
good upper bounds on the competitive ratio in unweighted and weighted congestion
games.
Ofﬂine and Online Optimization for Load Balancing with
Unrelated Machines
In the context of ofﬂine optimization, Lenstra et al. [116] and Shmoys and Tar-
dos [167] design 2-approximation algorithms for makespan minimization in load
balancing with unrelated machines; furthermore, Lenstra et al. [116] show that the
problem is not approximable within a ratio better than 3/2. In the case of related
machines, Hochbaum and Shmoys [104] design a PTAS.
For online minimization, Bartal et al. [16] design an algorithm providing a com-
petitive ratio slightly better than 2 (we observe that 2 is the competitive ratio result-
ing from the classical greedy algorithm of Graham [98]). Relatively to the online
L2-norm minimization, Awerbuch et al. [11] prove that the greedy algorithm has a
competitive ratio of at most 1+
√
2, and Caragiannis et al. [54] prove that this ratio
cannot be improved.
For the general online Lp-norm minimization, Awerbuch et al. [11] provide up-
per bounds growing as Θ(p) for the competitive ratio of the greedy algorithm, and
Caragiannis [48] gives tight bounds of
1
21/p−1 ∼Θ(p) for the competitive ratio of
the greedy algorithm and also prove that it cannot be improved by any online algo-
rithm, even for identical machines. Anyway, in the context of ofﬂine optimization,
the approximation guarantee has been improved by Makarychev and Sviridenko
[121], who provide a
ppBp +ε-approximation algorithm (for any ε > 0), where Bp
denotes the pth Bell number.

Chapter 3
Bounding the Inefﬁciency via the Primal-Dual
Method
The main tool used to show all the results in this book is the primal-dual method.
Introduced by Bil`o [22], this framework is based on the construction and analysis
of a primal-dual pair of linear programs, where the dual is used to provide tight
(or almost tight) upper bounds on the performance guarantee of a certain efﬁciency
metric, and the primal is used to construct tight (or almost tight) lower bounds.
In this chapter, we present the general scheme of the primal-dual method and
then show its effectiveness by doing some comparisons with respect to other ex-
isting techniques (e.g., the smoothness framework of Roughgarden [158]). We also
provide a warm-up example illustrating how to apply our machinery to a simple in-
troductory game. Then, in the subsequent chapters of the book, we shall give further
and more sophisticated applications; for instance, we shall apply it to congestion
games with very general latency functions (e.g., those deﬁned in Section 2.2), or to
other interesting variants of congestion games.
For further details on linear programming duality, the reader can refer to the
appendix (Section B.1) or to the textbooks by Matouek and G¨artner [124] and Boyd
and Vandenberghe [43].
3.1 The Primal-Dual Method
In this section, we describe the primal-dual method by applying it to a generic class
of congestion games, in which the underlying solution concepts, social functions
and efﬁciency metrics are not speciﬁed and given as input. Assume we want to
establish an upper bound on the worst-case performance guarantee of a solution
concept SC (e.g., pure Nash equilibria) with respect to a social function SF (e.g.,
total latency) and an efﬁciency metric EM (e.g., price of anarchy) in a class of games

3 Bounding the Inefﬁciency via the Primal-Dual Method
Primal Formulation
By ﬁxing an arbitrary game CG ∈G, a social optimum σσσ∗and a strategy proﬁle σσσ ∈
SC(CG), where SC(CG) denotes the set of strategy proﬁles of CG implementing the
considered solution concept SC, the method requires to construct a linear program
LPααα(SF,σσσ,σσσ∗) in a vector of variables ααα := (αe)e∈E deﬁned as
max

s.t.
constraintsααα(σσσ,σσσ∗)
(3.2)
SFααα(σσσ∗) = 1
(3.3)
αe ≥0
∀e ∈E
and satisfying the following properties:
• SFααα(σσσ) and SFααα(σσσ∗) are linear functions in the variables αes, that coincide
with SF(σσσ) and SF(σσσ∗) when all αes are equal to 1 (i.e., SF111(σσσ) = SF(σσσ) and
SF111(σσσ∗) = SF(σσσ∗)). For instance, SFααα can be obtained from SF by multiplying
the latency of each resource e by αe;
• constraintsααα(σσσ,σσσ∗) is a set of s ≥1 linear constraints that, for ααα = 111, capture
the properties possessed by the target solution concept (or a part of them). For
instance, when considering ε-approximate equilibria, we can use the argument
that the cost of player i in σσσ is no more than (1 + ε) times the cost that i can
suffer when deviating to strategy σ∗
i , and this leads to n inequalities (one for
each player); then, we can multiply the latency of each e ∈E by αe (in each
inequality), thus providing n linear inequalities/constraints;
• (3.3) is a normalization constraint imposing value 1 to the social optimum. This
shall imply that the maximum value of the objective function (3.1) is equal to
the highest ratio SFααα(σσσ)/SFααα(σσσ∗) = SFααα(σσσ).
We observe that, whenever SF(σσσ∗) ̸= 0 (if this is not the case, one can generally
show that the value of the considered efﬁciency metric is unbounded), the normal-
ization considered in (3.3) is well-deﬁned and does not affect the value of the ratio
SF(σσσ)/SFααα(σσσ∗) (as both the numerator and the denominator are linear in the αes).
Now, by the arbitrariness of σσσ, σσσ∗and CG, we have that the optimal value
SFααα(σσσ) = SFααα(σσσ)/SFααα(σσσ∗) is an upper bound on the worst-case performance of
the considered class of congestion games, with respect to the considered efﬁciency
metric EM.
A speciﬁc instantiation of the above general linear program has been provided
in Example 3.1, where the goal is to determine the price of anarchy of afﬁne un-
weighted congestion games.
Dual Formulation
Now, to provide a tight (or almost tight) upper bound, the method requires to derive
and analyze the dual of the above linear program which has the following represen-
tation:

∀t ∈[s],
where each dual variable xt is associated to a constraint in (3.2), γ is the dual variable
associated to the normalization constraint (3.3), and dualconstraintse((xt)t∈[s],γ) is
the dual constraint related to the primal variable αe. By providing a feasible solution
to the dual formulation, an upper bound on the worst-case performance guarantee of
the target solution concept is obtained. Indeed, by the Weak Duality Theorem1, the
value of the objective function of the dual program is at least the maximum value of
the objective function of the primal.
3.2 The Effectiveness of the Primal-Dual Method
An advantage of using the primal-dual method is that, for several efﬁciency met-
rics, and for several variants of congestion games, it is generally easy to determine
a primal program (of the type described above) whose optimal solution provides an
upper bound on the considered efﬁciency metric. Despite it is usually difﬁcult to ob-
tain this optimal solution, the dual formulation, instead, immediately provides some
inequalities dualconstraintse((xt)t∈[s],γ) that can be translated into compact and
quasi-explicit formulas yielding an upper bound γ on the worst-case performance of
the considered class of congestion games that is possibly tight. Moreover, the proof
of correctness of these formulas is automatically given by the correct deﬁnition of
the initial LP formulation and by the Weak Duality Theorem.
Smoothness Framework and the Primal-Dual Method
The quasi-explicit formulas derived by inspecting the dual are similar (and in some
cases equivalent) to those exploited within the smoothness framework2: an effective
machinery introduced and formalized by Roughgarden [158] with the aim of uni-
fying and generalizing several existing approaches adopted to quantify the perfor-
mance degradation under selﬁsh behavior. In particular, the smoothness-framework
can be used to derive tight (or almost tight) bounds on the efﬁciency of several
classes of games (including congestion games), and it is based on an inequality link-
ing together the social optimum and the sum of the players’ costs in an equilibrium,
thus requiring the use of two variables. However, for certain settings, additional
structural properties of the game need to be embedded in the model. This requires
more sophisticated constraints involving a larger number of variables.

of the appendix.
2 A formal description of the smoothness framework is deferred to Section B.2 of the appendix.

3 Bounding the Inefﬁciency via the Primal-Dual Method
The primal-dual method handles these twists more easily, as it sufﬁces writing
in the primal program all the additional constraints that need to be satisﬁed by the
model, and then the related dual program automatically provides the quasi-explicit
formulas that characterize the value of the considered efﬁciency metric3.
From Tight Upper Bounds to Tight Lower Bounds via Strong Duality
Another advantage of the primal-dual method is that, the more constraintsααα(σσσ,σσσ∗)
provide an accurate characterization of the properties of the target solution concept,
the more the achieved upper bound will be signiﬁcant (and possibly tight). Thus, by
considering an optimal solution of the dual program, and by resorting to the Strong
Duality Theorem and the complementary slackness conditions4, one can ﬁnd an
optimal solution to the primal program that can be used as an initial hint to construct
tight lower bounds on the considered efﬁciency metric.
An Introductory Example
To highlight the key-features of the primal-dual method and its advantages, we
illustrate its application to the characterization of the exact price of anarchy of
unweighted congestion games with afﬁne latency functions, thus reobtaining the
known result of Christodoulou and Koutsoupias [59] and Awerbuch et al. [12].
Example 3.1 (PoA of Afﬁne Unweighted Congestion Games [12, 59]). Given an ar-
bitrary afﬁne unweighted atomic congestion game CG, a pure Nash equilibrium σσσ
and an optimal strategy proﬁle σσσ∗, the following linear program in variables αes
and βes is clearly an upper bound on the price of anarchy (with respect to the total
latency function):

TL(σσσ) = ∑

Indeed, variables αes and βes are such that the latency function ℓe of each resource e
is of the form ℓe(x) := αe ·x+βe, i.e., it is an arbitrary afﬁne function. ke and oe are
the congestions of resource e in σσσ and σσσ∗, respectively. Observe that k2
e,o2
e,ke and
oe have to be considered as ﬁxed parameters. Constraints (3.5) impose necessary
conditions for σσσ to be a pure Nash equilibrium, constraint (3.6) imposes without

with more than two variables are given in Chapters 5 (Theorem 5.5) and 6 (Theorem 6.1).

loss of generality that the optimal social function TL(σσσ∗) is equal to 1, and the
objective function (3.4) is equal to the social function TL(σσσ) of σσσ. Because of
the normalization constraint (3.6), the objective function is also equal to the ratio
TL(σσσ)/TL(σσσ∗), and the maximum value of the considered linear program over all
possible strategy proﬁles σσσ and σσσ∗and congestion games CGs is clearly an upper
bound on TL(σσσ)/TL(σσσ∗), i.e., an upper bound on the price of anarchy of the class
of afﬁne unweighted atomic congestion games.
By summing all constraints in (3.2) we obtain a relaxed linear program in which
all constraints in (3.5) are replaced with constraint

is feasible, thus 5
2 is an upper bound on the price of anarchy
of afﬁne congestion games. It is also optimal, as it can be obtained by imposing
that (3.8) is tight (i.e., satisﬁed at equality) for (ke,oe) = (1,1) and (ke,oe) = (2,1).
Furthermore, in the dual program, we can avoid all non-tight constraints, and we
can simply use the (tight) dual constraints of type (3.8) related to (ke,oe) = (1,1)
and (ke,oe) = (2,1) respectively, without affecting the resulting optimal solution.
Thus, by applying the Strong Duality Theorem to the new dual program, we have
that the upper bound 5
2 can be also obtained as optimal solution of the relaxed pri-
mal program. Furthermore, since x > 0, the primal constraint (3.7) is tight (by the
complementary slackness conditions). We conclude that the maximum value of the
objective function in the following linear program is 5

2) is given by (α1,α2) =

, and it is univocally determined by
equalities (3.10) and (3.11). Now, starting form the previous linear program and its
optimal solution, we construct a congestion game CG satisfying the following tight
conditions:
• each player i ∈N has two strategies σi,σ∗
i only;

42
3 Bounding the Inefﬁciency via the Primal-Dual Method
• the cost of each player i in strategy proﬁle σσσ is equal to the objective function
(3.9), and then, it is also equal to the left-hand part of constraint (3.10);
• the cost of player i, when she unilaterally deviates to strategy σ∗
i from strategy
proﬁle σσσ, is equal to the right-hand part of constraint (3.10), thus σσσ is a pure
Nash equilibrium;
• the cost of each player i in strategy proﬁle σσσ∗is equal to the left-hand part of
constraint (3.11).
If we construct a congestion game CG satisying the previous tight conditions, the
price of anarchy of CG will be equal to 5
2, thus it will be a matching lower bound.
A very natural choice for such lower bound is a particular case of the class of lower
bounds provided by Aland et al. [7], who consider the more general case of un-
weighted games with polynomial latencies. For afﬁne latencies, the above lower
bound has the following structure:
• CG has a set of players N := [3] and a set of resources E := E1 ∪E2, with
E1 := {e1
1,e1
2,e1
3} and E2 := {e2
1,e2
2,e2
3};
• all the resources e of E1 (resp. E2) have latency function ℓ1(x) := α1x (resp.
ℓ2(x) := α2x), where (α1,α2) =
  1
2, 1
2

is the optimal solution of the previous
linear program (thus, in this particular case, it sufﬁces that all the resources have
the same linear latency function);
• each player i has strategies σi := {e1
i+1,e2
i+1,e2
i+2} and σ∗
i := {e1
i ,e2
i }, where
the resources’ indices are supposed to be cyclical (i.e. ej
i+3 := e j
i ).
We observe that, when a player i selects strategy σi (resp. σ∗
i ), she selects one re-
source from E1 and two resources from E2 (resp. one resource from E1 and one
resource from E2); furthermore, pair (k1,o1) = (1,1) (resp. (k2,o2) = (2,1)) is such
that k1 and o1 (resp. k2 and o2) are the congestions of each resource e ∈E1 (resp.
e ∈E2) under strategy proﬁles σσσ and σσσ∗, respectively.
By simple computations, one can easily verify that CG satisﬁes all the above tight
conditions, sufﬁcient to have a matching lower bound of 5
2 on the price of anarchy.
Note that the congestion game CG considered in this example, despite already used
in [7], has been here “reinterpreted” in terms of the hints given by the primal-dual
method.
3.3 Concluding Remarks and Related Work
The primal-dual method has been introduced and formalized in the seminal paper
of Bil`o [22], and then further applied and explored in several papers co-authored by
the authors of this book [18, 21, 23, 24, 26–29, 34–37, 42, 174, 175].
Other techniques for bounding the price of anarchy in non-cooperative games
based on primal-dual formulations have been proposed by Kulkarni and Mirrokni
[114], Nadav and Roughgarden [132] and Thang [172]. Similarly to the primal-dual
method, the technique proposed by Nadav and Roughgarden [132] operates by ex-
plicitly formulating the problem of maximizing the price of anarchy of a class of

3.3 Concluding Remarks and Related Work
43
games. However, despite using the same formulation, the two approaches differ in
the choice of the variables: while the primal-dual method relies on suitable multipli-
ers for the resource cost functions, Nadav and Roughgarden [132] use the probabil-
ity distributions deﬁning the outcomes occurring in the formulation. The methods
in Kulkarni and Mirrokni [114] and Thang [172], instead, build on a formulation
for the problem of optimizing the social function, and then implement the equilibria
conditions within the choice of the dual variables.
Further generalizations or variants of the above primal-dual techniques have been
also considered in the context of algorithmic design, with the aim of improving
the Price of Anarchy in non-cooperative games (see, for instance, the works of
Paccagnan et al. [140], Ravindran Vijayalakshmi and Skopalik [152]). With this
respect, Paccagnan et al. [139] and Paccagnan and Marden [138] propose a general
primal-dual framework to design the players utility/cost functions so as to optimize
the Price of Anarchy, and such functions are deﬁned as solutions of some tractable
linear programs.

Part III
Analysis of Selﬁsh and Greedy Outcomes
in Congestion Games

Chapter 4
Congestion and Load Balancing Games with
General Latency Functions
In this chapter, we analyze the performance of congestion games and load balancing
games with very general latency functions.
In Section 4.1, we resort to the primal-dual method to provide explicit (or quasi-
explicit) parametric formulas to compute upper bounds on the performance of
weighted congestion games with general latency functions. The efﬁciency metrics
we consider are the approximate price of anarchy and the approximate one-round
walks involving both selﬁsh and cooperative players.
Then, in Section 4.2, as the main result of the chapter, we show that the bounds
provided in Section 4.1 are tight even for load-balancing games (under mild as-
sumptions on the considered latency functions). Speciﬁcally, we show the following
results:
• If C is closed under abscissa and ordinate scaling, the approximate price of
anarchy does not improve when restricting to load balancing games (see Theo-
rem 4.2). Furthermore, if C contains unbounded functions only (except for the
eventual constant latency functions), the approximate price of anarchy does not
improve even for symmetric load balancing games.
• Under latency functions drawn from C, the competitive ratio of approximate
one-round walks generated by selﬁsh players does not improve when restricting
to load balancing games (see Theorem 4.3).
• If all functions in C are semi-convex, the same limitation applies to the com-
petitive ratio of approximate one-round walks generated by cooperative players
(see Theorem 4.3).
The results presented in Section 4.2 are obtained by designing some general load
balancing instances, which are parametrized by at most four numbers and two la-
tency functions belonging to C. We show that there exists a choice of the above
parameters such that the performance of the considered load balancing instances
matches that of general congestion games with latency functions in C. Indepen-
dently from our existential results, the load balancing instances we have introduced
may be useful to get good lower bounds on the performance of load balancing games

4 Congestion and Load Balancing Games with General Latency Functions
with latency functions in C, even if we are not able to quantify the exact value of the
metric adopted to measure the performance (see Remark 4.4).
In Section 4.3, we apply the above general results to the speciﬁc case of polyno-
mial latency functions, and we quantify the resulting approximate price of anarchy
and the competitive ratio (see Table 4.2 for some numerical comparisons).
In Section 4.4, we apply the machinery of Section 4.1 to provide upper bounds on
the efﬁciency of the f-weighted total load in load balancing games/problems with
unrelated machines.
Finally, in Section 4.5, we analyze the subclass of unweighted games, and we
obtain similar negative results as in the weighted case. In particular, we give the
main intuitions on how to apply the previous approaches to the unweighted case,
and we provide tight closed-form bounds on the efﬁciency of unweighted games
with general latency functions. These bounds hold even for load balancing games
if the underlying latencies are ordinate scaling. Again, we instantiate the obtained
results to the case of polynomial latency functions (see Table 4.3 for some numerical
comparisons).
4.1 Upper Bounds for General Congestion Games
In this section, we provide a theorem and a technical lemma, whose proofs are
both based on the primal-dual method. Theorem 4.1 gives quasi-explicit formulas to
compute upper bounds for the considered efﬁciency metrics, and then Lemma 4.1
provides some parameters that will be used in Section 4.2 to design tight load bal-
ancing lower bounds. More speciﬁcally, by following the primal-dual approach, we
start with a primal program constructed from an arbitrary congestion game, and by
exploiting its dual, we get the upper bounds of Theorem 4.1; as a complementary
result, the parameters provided by Lemma 4.1 are derived by analyzing a simpliﬁed
version of the initial primal program.1
We ﬁrst give some preliminary deﬁnitions. Given x ≥1, k > 0, o > 0, and a
latency function f, let
βW(EM,k,o, f) :=





−k f(k)+(1+ε)of(k +o)
if EM = PoAε,
−
R k
0 f(t)dt +(1+ε)o f(k +o)
if EM = CRs
ε,
−k f(k)+(1+ε)((k +o)f(k +o)−k f(k))
if EM = CRc
ε.
(4.1)
Given EM ∈{PoAε,CRs
ε,CRc
ε}, let
γW(EM,x,k,o, f) := k f(k)+x·βW(EM,k,o, f)
of(o)
;
(4.2)
1 We point out that the upper bounds provided in Theorem 4.1 can be equivalently derived by
resorting to the smoothness framework [158] (refer to Section B.2 in the appendix). Furthermore,
similar results as in Lemma 4.1 have been also considered in [20, 158], with the aim of designing
parametric load balancing instances whose performance match the upper bounds.

4.1 Upper Bounds for General Congestion Games
49
furthermore, given a class of weighted congestion games G, let
γW(EM,G) := inf
x≥1
sup
f∈C(G),k,o>0
γW(EM,x,k,o, f).
(4.3)
Theorem 4.1. Let G be a class of weighted congestion games. For any efﬁciency
metric EM ∈{PoAε,CRs
ε}, we have that EM(G) ≤γW(EM,G). This fact holds for
EM = CRc
ε if the latency functions of C(G) are semi-convex.
Proof. We prove the theorem for EM = PoAε by using the primal-dual approach,
and we give a sketch for the other cases, since the proof is analogue. Let CG ∈G,
and let σσσ and σσσ∗be an ε-approximate pure Nash equilibrium and an optimal strat-
egy proﬁle, respectively; for brevity, we use ke and oe in place of ke(σσσ) and ke(σσσ∗),
respectively. We have that the maximum value of the following linear program in
the variables αes is an upper bound on PoAε(CG):
LP1 :

{
∑
e∈E
αeoeℓe(oe) = 1
(4.5)
αe ≥0,
∀e ∈E.
Indeed, by setting αe = 1 for any e ∈E, we have that:
• the objective function is the social cost at the equilibrium;
• the constraints in (4.4) impose some relaxed ε-approximate pure Nash equilib-
rium conditions (ensuring that each player, at the equilibrium, does not get any
beneﬁt when deviating in favor of strategy σ∗
i );
• (4.5) is the normalized optimal social cost (normalization is possible since there
is some oe > 0, that implies oeℓe(oe) > 0).
By upper bounding all the weights wis with oe (we are allowed to do this since
wi ≤oe for any i ∈N and e ∈E such that e ∈σ∗
i ), by multiplying each constraint
in (4.4) by wi, and by summing all the resulting constraints in (4.4), we obtain the
following relaxation of LP1:

By putting the above inequalities together, we get
∑
e∈E
αekeℓe(ke) ≤(1+ε) ∑
e∈E
αeoeℓe(ke +oe),
that is equivalent to constraint (4.6). Consider the dual program of LP2 in the dual
variables x and γ (respectively associated to the dual constraints (4.6) and (4.7)):
DLP :

s.t.
γ ·oeℓe(oe) ≥keℓe(ke)+x·βW(PoAε,ke,oe,ℓe),
∀e ∈E
(4.8)
x ≥0,γ ∈R.
In DLP, one can assume that x ≥1, otherwise, if x < 1 and oe = 0 for some e ∈E,
the dual constraint in (4.8) related to e is not feasible. Now, one can assume that
oe > 0, since the constraint (4.8) corresponding to resource e is always veriﬁed if
oe = 0, so we can ignore this constraint. Let γ∗be the optimal value of DLP. By the
Weak Duality Theorem, we get γ∗≥PoAε(G). By (4.8) and the optimality of γ∗,
we get2
γ∗= min

e∈E γW(PoAε,x,ke,oe,ℓe) ≤inf
x≥1
sup
f∈C(G),

γW(EM,x,k,o, f) = γW(PoAε,G),
(4.9)
thus showing the claim for EM = PoAε.
For EM = CRs
ε, one can use a similar proof as in the previous case. Let CG ∈G be
an arbitrary congestion game, τττ = (σσσ0,σσσ1,...,σσσn) be an ε-approximate one-round
walk involving selﬁsh players, where σσσ := σσσn is the strategy proﬁle generated by τττ,
and let σσσ∗be an optimal strategy proﬁle of CG. We can consider the linear program
2 By exploiting the continuity of function −k f(k) with respect to k ≥0, we have that the supremum
(appearing in the inequalities) can be equivalently taken over k > 0 instead of k ≥0, without
reducing its value.

Such inequality is equivalent to constraint (4.6), but with CRs

thus, we can continue the analysis from a linear program analogue to LP2, and by
proceeding as in the case of the approximate price of anarchy, we can show the
claim for EM = CRs

Finally, we consider the case EM = CRc
ε. Again, let CG ∈G be an arbitrary con-
gestion game, τττ = (σσσ0,σσσ1,...,σσσn) be an ε-approximate one-round walk involving
cooperative players generating strategy proﬁle σσσ = σσσn, and σσσ∗be an optimal strat-
egy proﬁle of CG. Let ˆℓe denote the function deﬁned as ˆℓe(x) := xℓe(x) for any x ≥0.
By the hypothesis, ˆℓe is a convex function for any e ∈E. Again, we can consider the

⊓⊔
Remark 4.1 (Robustness of the Approximate Price of Anarchy). The efﬁciency met-
ric of the price of anarchy can be equivalently redeﬁned to measure the performance
with respect to the probabilistic generalizations of pure Nash equilibria deﬁned in
Section 2.3 (i.e., mixed Nash equilibria, correlated and coarse-correlated equilib-
ria). By exploiting the results of Roughgarden [158] and Bil`o [42], one can show
that the upper bounds on the approximate price of anarchy provided in Theorem 4.1
continue to hold even with respect to the generalized notions of equilibrium.
Lemma 4.1. Let G be a class of weighted congestion games. For each M < γW(EM,G),
with EM ∈{PoAε,CRs
ε}, one of the following cases holds:
• Case 1: there exists a non-constant latency function f ∈C(G) and two real
numbers k,o > 0 such that
M < k f(k)
of(o)
(4.19)
and βW(EM,k,o, f) ≥0.
• Case 2: there exist two latency functions f1, f2 ∈C(G) and four real numbers
k1,k2,o1,o2 > 0 such that
M < α1k1 f1(k1)+α2k2 f2(k2)
α1o1 f1(o1)+α2o2 f2(o2),
(4.20)
where α1 := βW(EM,k2,o2, f2) > 0 and α2 := −βW(EM,k1,o1, f1) > 0; fur-
thermore, if EM = PoAε, f1 and f2 can be chosen as non-constant latency
functions.
This fact holds for EM = CRc
ε if the latency functions of C(G) are semi-convex.
Proof (Sketch). The claim of Lemma 4.1 is obtained by inverting the proof argu-
ments of Theorem 4.1 as follows:

4 Congestion and Load Balancing Games with General Latency Functions
• We start from the upper bound γW(EM,G) obtained in Theorem 4.1.
• We derive a linear program DLP similar to the dual program used in The-
orem 4.1, but with two constraints only (except to those imposing the non-
negativity of the variables), and whose optimal value is higher than M. In partic-
ular, we show that there exist two triples of parameters T1 = (k1,o1, f1) and T2 =
(k2,o2, f2), with k1,k2,o1,o2 > 0 and f1, f2 ∈C, such that βW(EM,k1,o1, f1) <
0, βW(EM,k2,o2, f2) ≥0, and such that the two dual constraints of DLP (which
are deﬁned as in (4.8)) are parametrized by T1 and T2, respectively.
• The dual of DLP, denoted as LP, is similar to the linear program LP2 used
in Theorem 4.1, but with two constraints and two variables, and has the same
optimal value (higher than M) as in DLP (by the Strong Duality Theorem); in
particular, the new linear program is explicitly deﬁned as follows:
LP :
max
α1k1 f1(k1)+α2k2 f2(k2)
s.t.
α1βW(EM,k1,k1, f1)+α2βW(EM,k2,o2, f2) ≥0
α1o1 f1(o1)+α2o2 f2(o2) = 1
α1,α2 ≥0.
• Finally, the claim of Lemma 4.1 is obtained by characterizing the optimal solu-
tion of LP.
⊓⊔
Remark 4.2. By exploiting Lemma 4.1, we have that, for any choice of the input
parameters k,o, f (resp. k1,k2,o1,o2, f1, f2) such that βW(EM,k,o, f) ≥0 (resp.
βW(EM,k2,o2, f2) > 0 and −βW(EM,k1,o1, f1) > 0), the right hand-part of (4.19)
(resp. (4.20)) is a lower bound for γW(EM,G); we also observe that, by deﬁnition
of γW(EM,G), sup f∈C(G),k,o>0 γW(EM,x,k,o, f) is an upper bound on γW(EM,G)
for any x ≥1. Thus, if such upper bound (for a suitable choice of x) is equal to the
former lower bound (for a suitable choice of the input parameters), we necessarily
have that they are both equal to γW(EM,G).
Remark 4.3. In Lemma 4.1, if C(G) is closed under abscissa scaling, we can assume
without loss of generality that oj = 1 for each j ∈[2] (remove index j if the ﬁrst case
of Lemma 4.1 is veriﬁed). Indeed, if it is not the case, let ˆf j ∈C(G) be the latency
function such that ˆf j(k) := f j(o jk) for any k ≥0. If we consider tuple (kj/oj,1, ˆf j)
in place of tuple (kj,o j, f j) for each j ∈[2], the claim of Lemma 4.1 follows as well.
Analogously, if C(G) is closed under abscissa scaling, the supremum appearing in
the deﬁnition of γW(EM,C) does not decrease when assuming o = 1; thus, also
Theorem 4.1 holds under this assumption.
Example 4.1. To illustrate the claims of Theorem 4.1 and Lemma 4.1 with a more
concrete example, we consider the problem of evaluating the competitive ratio of ex-
act one-round walks involving selﬁsh players for afﬁne weighted congestion games.
Because of Theorem 4.1 and Remark 4.3, we get that:

4.2 Load Balancing Instances as Tight Lower Bounds
In this section, by using the characterization provided in Lemma 4.1, we show that
the upper bounds provided in Theorem 4.1 are tight under mild assumptions on the
considered latency functions, even for load balancing games.
Theorem 4.2. Let C be a class of latency functions that is closed under ordinate
and abscissa scaling. Then, γW(PoAε,W(C)) = PoAε(W(C)) = PoAε(WLB(C)).
If all latency functions of C (except for the constant ones) are unbounded, we get
γW(PoAε,W(C)) = PoAε(W(C)) = PoAε(WSLB(C)).
Proof (Sketch). First of all, we consider the case in which all latency functions, ex-
cept for the constant ones, are unbounded. Fix M < γW(PoAε,W(C)). In the proof,
we will show that there exists a load balancing instance LB ∈WSLB(C) such that
PoAε(LB) > M. By Lemma 4.1, this will imply that
M < PoAε(LB) ≤PoAε(W(C)) ≤γW(PoAε,W(C)),
and by the arbitrariness of M < γW(PoAε,W(C)), this fact will show the claim.
We make use of a multi-graph to represent a load balancing game together with two
special strategy proﬁles. This multi-graph is denoted as load balancing graph, and is

56
4 Congestion and Load Balancing Games with General Latency Functions
deﬁned as follows: the nodes are all the resources in E and each player is associated
to a weighted edge (e1,e2,w), where {e1} is denoted as her ﬁrst strategy, {e2} is
her second strategy, and w is her weight. With a little abuse of notation, any load
balancing graph will be also used to denote the corresponding load balancing game.
If Case 2 of Lemma 4.1 holds (with respect to C), let k1,k2,o1,o2, f1, f2,α1 =
βW(PoAε,k2,o2, f2),α2 = −βW(PoAε,k1,o1, f1) be the parameters considered in
the claim of Lemma 4.1. By Lemma 4.1, f1 and f2 can be chosen among the non-
constant latencies of C, thus, by hypothesis, they are unbounded. Furthermore, by
Remark 4.3, we can assume without loss of generality that o1 = o2 = 1.
Let s,n ∈N be two arbitrary positive integers. Consider a load balancing graph
LBs,n(k1,k2, f1, f2) yielded by a directed n-ary tree3, organized in 2s levels, num-
bered from 1 to 2s, and whose edges are oriented from the root to the leaves, with
the addition of n self-loops on the nodes of level 2s. The weight wi of a player asso-
ciated to an edge outgoing from a node at level i ∈[s] (resp. i ∈[2s]s+1) is equal to
(k1/n)i (resp. (k1/n)s(k2/n)i−s). For i, j ∈[2], deﬁne
θi, j :=

See Figure 4.1 for an example. Let σσσs,n be the strategy proﬁle in which all play-
ers select their ﬁrst strategy. By standard calculations, one can show the following
lemma:
Lemma 4.2. For any integer s ≥2, there exists n(s) ∈N, such that σσσs,n is an ε-
approximate pure Nash equilibrium of LBs,n(k1,k2, f1, f2) for any n ≥n(s).
The proof of the above lemma is omitted, and we only give a sketch of the proof. We
consider an arbitrary player whose ﬁrst strategy is a resource from a level i. Since
the game is symmetric, we have that: (i) if i ∈[2s −1] and the player deviates in
favor of a resource from level j = i+1, her cost decreases exactly of a factor 1+ε;
(ii) if i ∈[2s] and the player deviates in favor of a resource from level j ≤i, her cost
does not decrease; (iii) if i ∈[2s−2] and the player deviates in favor of a resource
from level j > i+1, if n is sufﬁciently large, her cost does not decrease. In any case,
the cost of the considered player, when she deviates, cannot decrease of a factor
higher than 1+ε, thus σσσs,n is a pure Nash equilibrium.
In the remainder of the proof, with the aim of estimating the approximate price
of anarchy of LBs,n(k1,k2, f1, f2), we compare the social value of the ε-pure Nash
3 With a little abuse of notation, the value of n considered in this load-balancing instance does
not represent the total number of players, but the number of players selecting each resource when
playing their ﬁrst strategy.

rectangle on some node/resource represents a player selecting that resource in σσσs,n (resp. σσσ∗

congestion of each resource in σσσs,n or σσσ∗

the resources at level i in σσσ∗
s,n. Then K · k j is the congestion of the resources at level i in σσσs,n,
K ·k j/n is the congestion of the resources at level i+1 in σσσ∗
s,n, and K ·k j ·kh/n is the congestion of
the resources at level i+1 in σσσs,n, where j = h = 1 if i ∈[s−1], j = 1 and h = 2 if i = s, j = h = 2
otherwise.
equilibrium σσσs,n, with that of the strategy proﬁle σσσ∗
s,n in which all players select their
second strategy. By exploiting the deﬁnition of α1 and α2 given in Lemma 4.1, by
standard (but long) calculations one can show that the quantity SUM(σσσs,n)
SUM(σσσ∗s,n) approaches
the value α1k1 f1(k1)+α2k2 f2(k2)
α1o1 f1(o1)+α2o2 f2(o2), as n and s tend to ∞. Thus, by Lemma 4.1, we get
PoAε(LBs,n(k1,k2, f1, f2)) > M for sufﬁciently large n and s.
Now, suppose that Case 1 of Lemma 4.1 holds, and let k,o, f be the parameters
considered in this case. As done previously, by Remark 4.3, we can assume with-
out loss of generality that o = 1. The load balancing instance we consider here is
LBs,n(k,k, f, f), and the strategy proﬁles σσσs,n and σσσ∗
s,n are deﬁned as in the previ-
ous part of the proof. By using the same proof arguments of the above case, we get
PoAε(LBs,n(k,k, f, f)) > M for sufﬁciently large n and s.
Finally, if there is some non-constant latency function in C(G) that is not un-
bounded, we can consider a non-symmetric load balancing game based on the load
balancing graph LBs,n(k1,k2, f1, f2) deﬁned above with n = 1 (i.e., the load balanc-
ing graph is a directed path), but where each player can select among her ﬁrst and
second strategy only, and based on the parameters k1,k2, f1, f2 or k, f derived ac-
cording to Lemma 4.1. Also in this case, by using the same proof arguments of the
above cases, we get PoAε(LBs,n(k1,k2, f1, f2)) > M for a sufﬁciently large s.
⊓⊔
Now, we prove that no improvements are possible for approximate one-round walks
when restricting to load balancing games.
Theorem 4.3. Let C be a class of latency functions that is closed under ordinate
and abscissa scaling. Then, γW(CRs
ε,W(C)) = CRs
ε(W(C)) = CRs
ε(WLB(C)). If all

58

functions in C are also semi-convex, we have that γW(CRc
ε,W(C)) = CRc
ε(W(C)) =
CRc
ε(WLB(C)).
Proof (Sketch). Fix M < γW(EM,W(C)), where EM ∈{CRs
ε,CRc
ε} is the considered
efﬁciency metric. As in Theorem 4.2, by Lemma 4.1, it is sufﬁcient showing that
there exists a load balancing game LB ∈WLB(C) whose competitive ratio is at least
M.
We start with the case of selﬁsh players. Let k1,k2, f1, f2,α1,α2 (resp. k,o, f) be
the parameters considered in Case 2 (resp. Case 1) of Lemma 4.1, but related to
EM = CRs
ε. For simplicity, in the following we set k1 = k2 = k, o1 = o2 = o, and
f1 = f2 = f, if Case 1 of Lemma 4.1 holds. By Remark 4.3, we can assume without
loss of generality that o1 = o2 = 1.
As in Theorem 4.2, we resort to a load balancing graph representation. In par-
ticular, we extend the load balancing graph LBs,n(k1,k2, f1, f2) deﬁned in the proof
of Theorem 4.2 as follows. Denote as i(v) the level of resource v. For each node u
in the load balancing graph, consider an arbitrary enumeration of all the n outgoing
edges of u. Since each node (but the root) has a unique incoming edge, we denote
by h(v) ∈[n] the label/position associated to the unique edge entering v in the given
ordering, so that, for any node u (but the leaves), all the n edges of type (u,v) are
associated to a label h(v) ∈[n].

4.2 Load Balancing Instances as Tight Lower Bounds

The weights of all players are deﬁned as in Theorem 4.2.
Consider the online process τττs,n in which players enter the game in non-increasing
order of level (with respect to their ﬁrst strategy) and, within the same level, players
are processed in non-decreasing order of position; equivalently, if two players iu and
iv have, as their ﬁrst strategies, some resources u and v respectively, such that either
i(u) > i(v), or i(u) = i(v) ∧h(u) < h(v), then player iu is processed before player
iv in the online process τττs,n. Let σσσs,n be strategy proﬁle obtained at the end of the
process, i.e., the strategy proﬁle in which each player selects her ﬁrst strategy. We
have the following lemma:
Lemma 4.3. The online process τττs,n is an ε-approximate one-round walk.
The above lemma can be shown as follows. Let z be an arbitrary player whose
ﬁrst strategy is at level i ∈[2s −1]; let u,v be the ﬁrst and second strategy of z,
respectively, and let h := h(v) be the position/label associated to resource v. By con-
struction of the online process τττs,n, we have that, when z enters the game, there are
h −1 players of weight wi already assigned to resource u, and n players of weight
wi+1 assigned to resource v. Let σσσu
s,n be the partial strategy proﬁle obtained when z
is processed according to τττs,n (i.e., only players preceding z have been already as-
signed), and z is assigned to her ﬁrst strategy u; let σσσv
s,n be the partial strategy proﬁle
in which z, instead, is assigned to her second strategy v. As our choice of player z has
been arbitrary, it is sufﬁcient proving that costz(σσσu
s,n) ≤(1 + ε)costz(σσσv
s,n) to show
that τττs,n is an ε-approximate one-round walk. By using the recursive deﬁnitions of
the latency functions gi and gi+1 (involving the quantities Au and Av, respectively),
and by using a similar approach as in case (i) of Lemma 4.2, one can easily show
that costz(σσσu
s,n) = gu(h · wi) = (1 + ε)gv(n · wi+1 + wi) = (1 + ε)costz(σσσv
s,n), thus
showing the claim of Lemma 4.3.
Now, let σσσ∗
s,n be the strategy proﬁle in which all players select their second strat-
egy. With the aim of estimating the competitive ratio of LBs,n(k1,k2, f1, f2), we com-
pare the social value of the strategy proﬁle σσσs,n resulting from the ε-approximate
one-round walk τττs,n with that of strategy proﬁle σσσ∗
s,n. As in Theorem 4.2, one can
show that for sufﬁciently large n and s, CRs
ε(LBs,n(k1,k2, f1, f2)) > M.
For cooperative players, let k1,k2,o1,o2, f1, f2,α1,α2 be as in Lemma 4.1 (re-
move index j ∈[2] and set α = 1 if Case 1 of Lemma 4.1 is veriﬁed). By Re-
mark 4.3, we assume without loss of generality that o1 = o2 = 1. Consider a
load balancing graph LBs,n(k1,k2, f1, f2) as the one deﬁned above, but with n = 1
and θi, j(1) :=
fi(ki)
(1+ε)((k j+1) f j(k j+1)−k j f j(kj)). Let σσσs,1, τττs,1, and σσσ∗
s,1 be deﬁned as in
the case of selﬁsh players (with n = 1). Similarly as in the case of selﬁsh play-
ers, one can show that τττs,1 is an ε-approximate one-round walk (involving coop-
erative players) that generates strategy proﬁle σσσs,1, and we can show again that
CRc
ε(LBs,n(k1,k2, f1, f2)) > M.
⊓⊔
Remark 4.4. Fix a metric EM ∈{PoAε,CRs
ε,CRc
ε}, a class of latency functions
C, and let (k1,k2,o1,o2, f1, f2) (resp. (k,o, f)) be a tuple such that the values
α1,α2 considered in Case 2 of Lemma 4.1 are positive (resp. such that the in-
equality of Case 1 corresponding to the considered metric EM is satisﬁed, i.e.,

60
4 Congestion and Load Balancing Games with General Latency Functions
βW(EM,k,o, f) ≥0). By Remark 4.3, we assume without loss of generality that
o1 = o2 = 1 (resp. o = 1). By inspecting the proofs of Theorems 4.2 and 4.3, we
observe that the set of load balancing instances of type LBs,n(k1,k2, f1, f2) (resp.
LBs,n(k,k, f, f)) guarantees a performance of at least α1k1 f1(k1)+α2k2 f2(k2)
α1 f(1)+α2 f(2)
(resp.
k f(k)
f(1) ) under the considered metric EM. Thus, in the case we are not able to quan-
tify the exact value of γW(EM,W(C)), we can still ﬁnd a tuple (k1,k2, f1, f2) (resp.
(k, f)) that leads to good (and possibly tight) lower bounds; in particular, the tight-
ness can be shown by using the characterization provided in Remark 4.2.
4.3 Application to Polynomial Latency Functions
Consider the class P(d) of polynomials with non-negative coefﬁcients and maxi-
mum degree d. By Lemma 4.1, γW(EM,W(P(d))) is an upper bound on the efﬁ-
ciency metrics EM ∈{PoAε,CRs
ε,CRc
ε} for weighted congestion games and load
balancing games with polynomial latency functions of maximum degree d.
By exploiting the deﬁnition of γW(EM,W(P(d))) given at the beginning of this
section, and by applying to these deﬁnitions similar arguments as those used in
Aland et al. [7] and Christodoulou et al. [63], one can compute the exact value
of γW(EM,W(P(d))) for any EM ∈{PoAε,CRs
ε,CRc
ε}. In particular, we have that
γW(EM,W(P(d))) is equal to
 ϕε,d
d, where ϕε,d is deﬁned as the unique solution
k ≥0 of equation:
• −kd+1 +(1+ε)(k +1)d = 0 if EM = PoAε,
• −kd+1
d+1 +(1+ε)(k +1)d = 0 if EM = CRs
ε,
• −(2+ε)kd+1 +(1+ε)(k +1)d+1 = 0 if EM = CRc
ε.
A way to interpret the above tight bounds is provided by Remark 4.4. In partic-
ular, one can show that the exact value of γW(EM,W(P(d))) is attained by k f(k)
f(1) ,
where f is the monomial function deﬁned as f(t) = td for any t ≥0, and k is the
unique value satisfying constraint βW(EM,k,1, f) ≥0 at equality.
Since the class of polynomial latency functions P(d) satisﬁes the hypothesis of
Theorems 4.2 and 4.3, as a corollary we have that the values γW(EM,W(P(d)))
considered above are tight bounds on the performance of load balancing instances,
and even that of symmetric load balancing instances if the efﬁciency metric is the
ε-price of anarchy; thus, for polynomial latency functions, the performance does not
improve when assuming that the players’ strategies are singletons.
See Figure 4.2 for some numerical comparisons.

4.4 Application to Load Balancing Problems with Unrelated
Machines
For a given increasing and continuous function f : R≥0 →R≥0 with f(0) = 0, one
can use the same arguments of Theorem 4.1 to give upper bounds on the perfor-
mance of load balancing games with unrelated machines, when the considered so-
cial function is the f-weighted total load WTL f (for this class of games, refer to
Section 2.6). Let γW(EM,x,k,o, f) be the quantity deﬁned in (4.2).
Theorem 4.4. The ε-approximate price of anarchy of any load balancing game LB
with unrelated machines, with respect to the f-weighted total load, is at most
PoAε(LB) ≤inf
x≥1 sup
k,o>0
γW(PoAε,x,k,o, f).
(4.22)
Proof (Sketch). Fix a load balancing game LB := (I,J,(wi,j)i,j) with unrelated ma-

Consider the following linear program LP1 f in variables (αi)i∈I, in place of the
linear program LP1 deﬁned in Theorem 4.1:

4 Congestion and Load Balancing Games with General Latency Functions
Observe that, by setting αi = 1 for any i ∈I, (4.23) is the f-weighted total load of σσσ,
(4.24) is a relaxed ε-Nash equilibrium condition for any job j ∈J, and the left-hand
part of (4.25) is the f-weighted total load of σσσ∗. Thus, by similar considerations as
those in Theorem 4.1, we get that the objective function of LP1 f is an upper bound
on the ε-price of anarchy of linear load balancing games with unrelated machines.
Now, by proceeding as in the proof of Theorem 4.1, one can show that the right-hand
part of (4.22) is an upper bound on the ε-price of anarchy of linear load balancing
with unrelated machines.
⊓⊔
By using a similar approach as in the above theorem to construct the initial linear
program, and by proceeding as in Theorem 4.1 (in particular, by resorting to the
competitive ratio analysis) one can also prove the following theorem.
Theorem 4.5. The competitive ratio of ε-approximate one-round walks involving
selﬁsh players of any load balancing game LB with unrelated machines, with respect
to the f-weighted total load, is at most
PoAε(LB) ≤inf
x≥1 sup
k,o>0
γW(EM,x,k,o, f),
(4.26)
where EM = CRs
ε. The above upper bound also holds for EM = CRc
ε (i.e., for coop-
erative players) if the function f is semi-convex.
Remark 4.5. As a byproduct of our results, we also have that the upper bound of
Theorem 4.5, for cooperative players and ε = 0, is an upper bound on the approx-
imation guarantee of the classical greedy algorithm for (ofﬂine and online) load
balancing problems under the f-weighted total load.
Remark 4.6. As the load balancing instances considered in Theorems 4.2 and 4.3
can be seen as particular cases of load balancing instances with related machines
and restricted assignments (unrestricted assignments when the game is symmetric),
we can easily turn the lower bounds of Section 4.2 into tight lower bounds for the
efﬁciency guarantees shown in Theorems 4.4 and 4.5.
4.5 The Unweighted Case
By resorting to the same approach adopted for weighted games, in Theorem 4.6,
we provide quasi-explicit formulas to compute upper bounds for unweighted games
with general latency functions. Then, in Lemma 4.4, we provide some parameters
that can be used to derive tight lower bounds. The proofs are omitted as they are
equivalent to those of Theorem 4.1 and Lemma 4.1.
We ﬁrst give some preliminary deﬁnitions. Given x ≥1, k ∈Z≥0, o ∈N, and a
latency function f, let

furthermore, given a class of unweighted congestion games G, let
γU(EM,G) := inf
x≥1

f∈C(G),k∈Z≥0,o∈N
γU(EM,x,k,o, f).
Theorem 4.6. Let G be a class of unweighted congestion games. For any efﬁciency
metric EM ∈{PoAε,CRs
ε}, we have that EM(G) ≤γU(EM,G). This fact holds for
EM = CRc
ε if the latency functions of C(G) are semi-convex.
Lemma 4.4. Let G be a class of unweighted congestion games. For each M <
γU(EM,G), with EM ∈{PoAε,CRs
ε}, one of the following cases holds:
• Case 1: there exists a latency function f ∈C(G) and two integer numbers k >
0,o > 0 such that
M < k f(k)
of(o)
and βU(EM,k,o, f) ≥0.
• Case 2: there exist two latency functions f1, f2 ∈C(G) and four integer numbers
k2 ≥0, k1,o1,o2 > 0 such that
M < α1k1 f1(k1)+α2k2 f2(k2)
α1o1 f1(o1)+α2o2 f2(o2),
where α1 := βU(EM,k2,o2, f2) > 0 and α2 := −βU(EM,k1,o1, f1) > 0.
This fact holds for EM = CRc
ε if the latency functions of C(G) are semi-convex.
By exploiting Lemma 4.4, as done for weighted games, we show that the upper
bounds of Theorem 4.6 are tight even for load balancing games, under mild as-
sumptions.
Theorem 4.7. Let C be a class of latency functions that is closed under ordinate
scaling. Then γU(PoAε,U(C)) = PoAε(ULB(C)) = PoAε(U(C)).
Theorem 4.8. Let C be a class of latency functions that is closed under ordinate
scaling. Then γU(CRs

ε(ULB(C)). If the functions of C
are semi-convex, we have that γU(CRc

ε(U(C)) = CRc

4 Congestion and Load Balancing Games with General Latency Functions
To show the above theorems, we ﬁx an arbitrary M < γU(EM,G), and by using
a similar approach as in Theorems 4.2 and 4.3, we construct a class of load bal-
ancing games LBs(k1,k2,o1,o2, f1, f2) parametrized by four non-negative integers
k1,k2,o1,o2, two latency functions f1, f2 and an integer s. The above parameters are
those provided in Lemma 4.4, where we set k1 = k2 = k, o1 = o2 = o, and f1 = f2 = f
if the ﬁrst case of the lemma is veriﬁed. By using a similar proof as in Theorems 4.2
and 4.3, we show that EM(LBs(k1,k2,o1,o2, f1, f2)) > M for a sufﬁciently large s.
The lower bound constructions used in Theorems 4.7 and 4.8 are quite technical
and are omitted. Here, we only show two weaker versions of Theorems 4.7 and 4.8,
in which we provide tight lower bounds holding for general congestion games only.
Theorem 4.9. We have that γU(PoAε,U(C)) = PoAε(U(C)) for any class C of la-
tency functions.4
Proof. We ﬁrst assume that C is closed under ordinate-scaling.
Let M < γU(PoAε,U(C)), and let k1,k2,o1,o2, f1, f2 be the parameters provided
by Lemma 4.4, where we set k1 = k2 = k, o1 = o2 = o, and f1 = f2 = f if the ﬁrst
case of the lemma is veriﬁed. Let CG := CG(k1,k2,o1,o2, f1, f2) be a congestion
game deﬁned as follows:
• we have a set N of n := max{k1 +o1,k2 +o2} players;
• the set of resources is E := E1 ∪E2, where E1 := {e1,1,...e1,n} and E2 :=
{e2,1,...e2,n};
• each player i ∈N has two strategies si,s∗
i only, namely,
si := {e1,i,...,e1,i+k1−1}∪{e2,i,...,e2,i+k2−1} and
s∗
i := {e1,i+k1,...,e1,i+k1+o1−1}∪{e2,i+k2,...,e2,i+k2+o2−1},
where the resource indexes are cyclical (i.e., e j,i+n := e j,i);
• for any j ∈[2], the latency function of each resource e ∈Ej is deﬁned as
ℓj(x) = αj · f j(x) for any x ≥0, where α1 := βU(EM,k2,o2, f2) > 0 and
α2 := −βU(EM,k1,o1, f1) > 0 if the second case of Lemma 4.4 holds, and
α1 := α2 := 1 if the ﬁrst case holds.
Let σσσ (resp. σσσ∗) be the strategy proﬁle in which each player i plays strategy si (resp.
s∗
i ). As
ci(σσσ) = α1k1 f1(k1)+α2k2 f2(k2)
= (1+ε)(α1o1 f1(k1 +1)+α2o2 f2(k2 +1))
= (1+ε)ci(σσσ−i,s∗
i )
4 An equivalent version of Theorem 4.9 has appeared in Roughgarden [158], where the upper
bound is written in terms of the smoothness framework and the lower bounding instance is the
the same as the one provided here. We also point out that a similar instance has been previously
introduced by Aland et al. [7] for the case of polynomial latency functions.

4.5 The Unweighted Case
65
for any player i ∈N, we have that σσσ is an ε-approximate pure Nash equilibrium.
Furthermore, we have that
PoAε(CG) ≥SUM(σσσ)
SUM(σσσ∗) = (α1k1 f1(k1)+α2k2 f2(k2))n
(α1o1 f1(o1)+α2o2 f2(o2))n > M,
where the last inequality follows from Lemma 4.4. Thus, CG is a tight lower bound-
ing instance.
Now, if C is not ordinate-scaling, we consider again the lower bounding instance
CG deﬁned above. This game guarantees a tight lower bound, but its latencies might
not belong to C. Anyway, we can easily modify CG in such a way that each resource
of group Ej (for j ∈[2]) is replaced with a number of resources approximately
proportional to αj and having latency f j, so that the new instance has latencies in C,
the equilibria conditions are guaranteed, and the resulting price of anarchy is again
above M.
⊓⊔
Theorem 4.10. We have that γU(CRs
ε,U(C)) = CRs
ε(U(C)) for any class C of la-
tency functions. Furthermore, if the latency functions of C are semi-convex, we get
γU(CRc
ε,U(C)) = CRc
ε(U(C)).5
Proof. As in Theorem 4.9, we can assume without loss of generality that C is
closed under ordinate-scaling. We ﬁrst show the theorem for EM = CRs
ε. Let M <
γU(EM,U(C)), and let k1,k2,o1,o2, f1, f2 be the parameters provided by Lemma 4.4,
where we set k1 = k2 = k, o1 = o2 = o, and f1 = f2 = f if the ﬁrst case of
the lemma is veriﬁed. Let ˆn := max{k1 + o1,k2 + o2}. For any integer n > ˆn, let
CGn := CGn(k1,k2,o1,o2, f1, f2) be a congestion game deﬁned as follows:
• N := [n] is the set of players,
• the set of resources is E := E1 ∪E2, where E1 := {e1,1,...e1,n+ˆn} and E2 :=
{e2,1,...e2,n+ˆn};
• each player i > ˆn has two strategies si,s∗
i only, namely,
si := {e1,i,...,e1,i+k1−1}∪{e2,i,...,e2,i+k2−1} and
s∗
i := {e1,i−o1,...,e1,i−1}∪{e2,i−o2,...,e2,i−1};
• each player i ≤ˆn is constrained to play strategy si deﬁned as in the above case;
• for any j ∈[2], the latency function of each resource e ∈Ej is deﬁned as
ℓj(x) = α j · f j(x) for any x ≥0, where α1 := βU(EM,k2,o2, f2) > 0 and
α2 := −βU(EM,k1,o1, f1) > 0 if the second case of Lemma 4.4 holds, and
α1 := α2 := 1 if the ﬁrst case holds.
Let σσσn (resp. σσσ∗
n) be the strategy proﬁle in which each player i plays strategy si
(resp. s∗
i if i > ˆn, and si if i ≤ˆn). Let τττn := (σσσ1
n,σσσ2
n,...,σσσn
n) be the online process
in which all the players enter the game in increasing order of their indexes, and
5 A similar lower bounding instance as the one presented in Theorem 4.10 has been introduced by
Bil`o et al. [31] for the restricted case of afﬁne functions.

66
4 Congestion and Load Balancing Games with General Latency Functions
choose strategy si; we observe that σσσn is the strategy proﬁle obtained at the end
(i.e., σσσn = σσσn
n). For any player i > ˆn, we have that
ci(σσσi
n) = α1

i ),
thus τττn is an ε-approximate one-round walk involving selﬁsh players. Furthermore
we have that

> M,
where the last inequality follows from Lemma 4.4. Thus, by the arbitrariness of M,
the claim follows.
Now, if EM = CRc
ε, we can reuse the same lower bounding instance considered
for the case of selﬁsh players, where the parameters k1,k2,o1,o2, f1, f2 are again
deﬁned according to Lemma 4.4, but with respect to EM = CRc
ε. Let us deﬁne σσσn,
σσσ∗
n, τττn as in the above case. Similarly to the case of selﬁsh players, one can show
that τττ is an ε-approximate one-round walk involving cooperative players, and that
limn→∞
SUM(σσσn)
SUM(σσσn∗) approaches (α1k1 f1(k1)+α2k2 f2(k2))n
(α1o1 f1(o1)+α2o2 f2(o2))n as n tends to inﬁnite. Thus, the
claim follows for cooperative players too.
⊓⊔
Remark 4.7. By exploiting the lemmas and the theorems of this section, we have
that similar observations and characterizations as those provided in Remarks 4.2
and 4.4 can be easily reformulated for the unweighted case, too.
Application to Polynomial Latency Functions
Let γU(EM,U(P(d))) with EM ∈{PoAε,CRs
ε,CRc
ε} be the quantity deﬁned at the
beginning of the section, where P(d) is the class of polynomial latency functions of
maximum degree d. By Theorem 4.6, γU(EM,U(P(d))) is an upper bound on the
efﬁciency metrics EM ∈{PoAε,CRs
ε,CRc
ε} for unweighted congestion games and
load balancing games with polynomial latency functions of maximum degree d.
γU(PoAε,U(P(d))) has been evaluated in Aland et al. [7] and Christodoulou et al.
[61]. γU(CRc
ε,U(P(d))) has been evaluated in Caragiannis et al. [54] for exact pure

4.6 Concluding Remarks and Related Work
67
Nash equilibria and afﬁne functions. By using similar arguments as in Aland et al.
[7], one can easily compute the exact value of γU(CRc
ε,U(P(d))) for any ε > 0.
The above values of EM ∈{PoAε,CRc
ε} can be also represented according to Re-
mark 4.7. In particular, let k be the unique real solution of equation βU(EM,k,1, f) =
0, where f is the monomial function deﬁned as f(t) = td. If k is not integer, we
have that γU(EM,U(P(d))) is equal to α1k1 f1(k1)+α2k2 f2(k2)
α1o1 f1(o1)+α2o2 f2(o2), where (k1,k2,o1,o2) :=
(⌊k⌋+ 1,⌊k⌋,1,1), f1 := f2 := f, and α1 and α2 are deﬁned as in Case 2 of
Lemma 4.4 with respect to parameters k1,k2,o1,o2, f1, f2. Instead, if k is integer,
we have that γU(EM,U(P(d))) is equal to k f(k)
f(1) , i.e., Case 1 of Lemma 4.4 is satis-
ﬁed by tuple (k,1, f).
Since the class of polynomial latency functions P(d) satisﬁes the hypothesis of
Theorems 4.7 and 4.8, as a corollary we have that the values of γU(EM,U(P(d)))
considered above are tight upper bounds on the performance of load balancing
games, thus matching the performance of general congestion games.
Regarding the ε-approximate one-round walks generated by selﬁsh players, the
exact value of γU(CRs
ε,U(P(d))) has been provided in Bil`o [22] for d ∈[3] and
ε = 0, thus, by Theorem 4.8, such a value is tight even for load balancing games.
For more general polynomial latency functions with maximum degree d > 3 and
for any ε ≥0, an upper bound on γU(CRs
ε,U(P(d))) can be trivially obtained by
reusing the upper bounds holding for the weighted case; for exact one-round walks,
a better upper bound has been provided in Klimm et al. [110]. By Remark 4.7,
we can get good lower bounds on the performance of ε-approximate one-round
walks, having a similar representation as in the cases of EM ∈{PoAε,CRc
ε}. In
particular, let k be the highest non-negative integer such that βU(CRs
ε,k,1, f) ≥0,
where f is the monomial function deﬁned as f(t) = td. If βU(CRs
ε,k,1, f) > 0 (resp.
βU(CRs
ε,k,1, f) = 0), we can consider the lower bounding instances used in Theo-
rems 4.8 or 4.10, parametrized by (k +1,k,1,1, f, f) (resp. (k,k,1,1, f, f)). By Re-
mark 4.7, the performance of such instances is equal to α1k1 f1(k1)+α2k2 f2(k2)
α1o1 f1(o1)+α2o2 f2(o2) (resp.
k f(k)
of(o)), where α1 and α2 are deﬁned as in Lemma 4.4.
See Figure 4.3 for some numerical comparisons.
4.6 Concluding Remarks and Related Work
Most of the results presented in this Chapter are based on the preliminary works
of Bil`o and Vinci [24, 25] (see [30] for the arXiv full-version), who show that the
performance of load balancing games, under mild assumptions on the latency func-
tions, is not better than that of general congestion games. The results of Bil`o and
Vinci presented here have addressed several open questions on the performance of
load balancing games:
• Bhawalkar et al. [20] provided upper bounds on the price of anarchy of weighted
congestion games and, under mild assumptions on the latency functions, such

Fig. 4.3 The competitive ratio of exact one-round walks generated by cooperative players in un-
weighted load balancing games with polynomial latency functions of maximum degree d. The
acronym “L.B.” means that the reported values are lower bounds only; for the upper bounds, the
reader can refer to the values reported for weighted games (Figure 4.2).
bounds are tight. Theorem 4.2 shows that the above bounds, under the same as-
sumptions, are tight even for load balancing games. Furthermore, if the latency
functions are unbounded, the above tight bounds hold even for the subclass
of symmetric load balancing games; this result generalizes some ﬁndings of
Bhawalkar et al. [20], in which a similar limitation was shown for games with
polynomial latencies only.
• The speciﬁc results on the concept of one-round walks have multiple implica-
tions, too. For instance, they close the gap between upper and lower bounds
on the competitive ratio of exact one-round walks generated by selﬁsh players,
for congestion games with afﬁne latency functions. Indeed, Christodoulou et al.
[63] showed that γW(CRs
0,W(P(1))) = 2
√
3+4 ≈7.464 is an upper bound, and
Bil`o et al. [31] provided a lower bound of 2+
√
5 ≈4.236 (holding even for un-
weighted congestion games); closing the above gap has been left as an open
question. By exploiting Theorem 4.3, we get that the upper bound ≈7.464 pro-
vided in [63] is tight, even for load balancing games.
• Christodoulou et al. [63] and Klimm et al. [110] provided upper bounds for the
competitive ratio of general congestion games with afﬁne and polynomial la-
tency functions, respectively, but tight lower bounds were missing. Theorem 4.3
automatically guarantees that such bounds are tight, even for load balancing
games. If all functions in C are semi-convex, the same limitation applies to
the competitive ratio of approximate one-round walks generated by cooperative
players; this fact generalizes results from Awerbuch et al. [11], Caragiannis [49]
and Caragiannis et al. [54], which hold only with respect to exact one-round
walks for games with polynomial latency functions.
• Relatively to the unweighted case, the results obtained in Theorems 4.7 and 4.8
generalize some ﬁndings of Caragiannis et al. [54] and Gairing and Schopp-
mann [92], which hold only with respect to pure Nash equilibria and polyno-

mial latency functions, and generalize a result of Caragiannis et al. [54] and Suri
et al. [170] which holds only with respect to exact one-round walks generated
by cooperative players in games with afﬁne latency functions.
• Bil`o et al. [31] showed that the upper bound on the competitive ratio of exact
one-round walks involving selﬁsh players provided by Christodoulou et al. [63]
for the case of afﬁne latencies is tight. However, the lower bounding instance
provided by Bil`o et al. [31] is a general congestion game, and the authors left
as an open problem the case of singleton strategies (for which the gap between
upper and lower bound was not close yet). Theorem 4.8 can be directly used to
construct a load balancing instance whose performance matches that of general
congestion games, thus closing the above gap.
Other results obtained in Bil`o and Vinci [24] are related to the quantiﬁcation of
the inefﬁciency in the restricted case of games with identical resources, and we
give a brief overview of such results. In particular, we have that, if f is a non-
decreasing, continuous, and semi-convex function, the approximate price of anar-
chy of weighted symmetric load balancing games with identical resources having
latency function f is at most equal to
sup
x>0
max
λ∈(0,1)
λx f(x)+(1−λ)[x]ε, f f([x]ε, f )
(λx+(1−λ)[x]ε, f )f(λx+(1−λ)[x]ε,f ),
where [x]ε,f := inf{t ≥0 : f(x) ≤(1+ε)f(x/2+t)}, and such upper bound is tight
under some mild assumptions. This generalizes a result obtained by Gairing et al.
[93], which holds only with respect to the price of anarchy under monomial latency
functions. Finally, still for the case of identical resources, better lower bounds on the
performance of exact one-round walks in load balancing games with unweighted
players have been provided (this improves and generalizes a result of Caragiannis
et al. [54] which holds only for afﬁne latency functions).
The machinery deﬁned in Bil`o and Vinci [24] has been further explored to pro-
vide load balancing instances as tight lower bounds for several classes of congestion
games. In this direction, the works of Benita et al. [18], Bil`o et al. [35], Bil`o et al.
[39], Caragiannis et al. [56]6 have provided tight (or almost) tight on the perfor-
mance of some variants of congestion games, and some of the tight lower bounds
have been constructed by resorting to the modus-operandi described in this chapter.
In particular:
• Benita et al. [18] study some variants of congestion games, called θ-free ﬂow
games; for this class of games, several upper and lower bounds have been
constructed by resorting to the primal-dual method and by using similar load-
balancing structures as those provided in Theorems 4.2 and 4.7.
• Bil`o et al. [39], Bil`o et al. [41] study the efﬁciency of weighted and unweighted
congestion games under the Nash social welfare, that is a well-known social
6 The works of Bil`o et al. [35] and Benita et al. [18] are also discussed in the “Concluding Remarks
and Related work” sections of Chapters 5 and 6, as they are inherent with the results presented in
these chapters.

function deﬁned as a weighted geometric mean of the players’ costs. Some of
the upper and lower bounds have been derived by reconsidering the approaches
presented in this chapter.
• Bil`o et al. [35] introduce a new notion of mixed equilibrium and study the ef-
ﬁciency of both weighted and unweighted afﬁne congestion games under this
framework. The lower bounds for the weighted (resp. unweighted) case have
been derived using a construction similar to those adopted in Theorem 4.2 (resp.
Theorem 4.7).
• Caragiannis et al. [56] analyze the efﬁciency of certain (scheduling) policies
for machine-scheduling games/problems, that randomly schedule the jobs as-
signed to any machine, according to certain probability distributions. Almost
tight lower bounds on the efﬁciency have been provided by resorting to similar
load balancing constructions as in Theorem 4.2.

Chapter 5
Uniform Mixed Equilibria
In this chapter, we introduce the notion of uniform mixed equilibrium in atomic
congestion games. Given an integer ρ ≥1, a ρ-uniform mixed strategy is a mixed
strategy in which exactly ρ pairwise disjoint (i.e., not sharing any resource) subsets
of resources are chosen with uniform probabilities. Hence, a ρ-uniform mixed equi-
librium is a ρ-uniform mixed proﬁle, i.e., a tuple of ρ-uniform mixed strategies,
one for each player, in which no player can lower her cost by deviating to another
ρ-uniform mixed strategy. Observe that a 1-uniform mixed equilibrium coincides
with a pure Nash equilibrium, but when ρ > 1, there are no correlations between
the notion of ρ-uniform mixed equilibria and that of pure or mixed Nash equilibria
of a given game. More precisely, for ρ > 1, ρ-uniform mixed strategies can be in-
terpreted as an hybridization between the notions of pure and mixed strategies. In
fact, although the cost incurred by a player needs to be evaluated in expectation (as
it happens when adopting mixed strategies), the fact that probabilities are superim-
posed by the model limits the players’ choices to deciding which strategies to play
(as it happens when adopting pure strategies).
We apply this behavioral model to the class of congestion games with unweighted
players. We ﬁrst show that ρ-uniform mixed equilibria do exist, for each ρ ≥1. This
generalizes Rosenthal’s Theorem [154], which applies to the basic case of ρ = 1.
Then, for each ρ ≥1, we derive tight bounds on the price of anarchy and the price
of stability of ρ-uniform mixed equilibria in afﬁne games; the bounds are obtained
by resorting to the primal-dual method. For a numerical comparison, see the values
reported in Table 5.1, where many lower bounds hold even under additional restric-
tions. The obtained results show that, as ρ increases, the price of anarchy and the
price of stability of ρ-uniform mixed equilibria approach the value 4/3, that is, the
price of anarchy of non-atomic games [159]. This is in accordance with the intuition
that, by arbitrarily splitting an atomic request over disjoint strategies, atomic con-
gestion games tend to their non-atomic counterparts. The striking evidence of these
ﬁndings, however, is that this happens for ρ = 4 already.
The equilibrium existence, as well as the PoA and PoS bounds, are obtained
by exploiting the fact that, for each ρ ≥1, any unweighted congestion game in
which players adopt ρ-uniform mixed strategies is isomorphic to an unweighted

congestion game in which players adopt pure strategies and whose latency functions
are slightly different. We also provide the main intuitions on how, by using this
isomorphism and adapting the techniques presented in Chapter 4, results for the
price of anarchy can be generalized to general latency functions.
This chapter is based on the results obtained by Bil`o et al. [35], and the interested
reader can refer to its full version for the missing proofs and other results. In the
“Concluding Remarks and Related Work” section at the end of the chapter, we also
give a brief overview of the results obtained in [35] for the price of anarchy of
weighted games (some values are listed in Table 5.1), and we point out several
relevant references connected with the results presented here.
5.1 Uniform Mixed Equilibria and Fault-Tolerant Systems
The notion of uniform mixed equilibria can be used as a reasonable model for risk-
averse behavior in resource selections games with failures (Penn et al. [145, 148,
149]). Consider, for instance, the case in which players need to send messages from
a source to a destination in a communication network whose links are subject to
adversarial failures. In particular, the adversary, upon knowledge of the strategies
adopted by the players, has the power of corrupting any subset of k links, for a cer-
tain k ≥1. Consider risk-averse players who are interested in choosing the fastest
route among the ones minimizing the probability of failures (or keeping it below
a certain threshold). In order to provide the adversary with the fewest possible in-
formation, each player will end up adopting a ρ-uniform mixed strategy, for some
ρ > k. Indeed, this line of reasoning can be applied in other contexts as well, e.g.,
that of minimizing the probability that a message gets intercepted by an attacker.
Moreover, consider the special case of symmetric network congestion games,
i.e., network congestion games in which all players share the same set of strategies.

5.2 Model and Deﬁnitions
73
This symmetric setting has been widely studied with respect to the analysis of efﬁ-
ciency of Nash equilibria (Fotakis et al. [90]) and to the (hardness of) computation
of equilibria (Deeparnab et al. [82], Fabrikant et al. [83]). In a highly unsafe sce-
nario (in which, for instance, rescue robots have to be used), the players’ priority is
often that of minimizing the probability of a failure, and then minimization of the
expected cost comes only as a secondary objective. Thus, every player will adopt a
ρ-uniform mixed strategy with ρ = k, where k is the maximum number of resource-
disjoint strategies (i.e., paths) available to players. It is worth noticing that, in the
context of network symmetric congestion games, it is well known that the value of
k can be easily computed by a reduction to the max-ﬂow problem (see, for instance,
Ahuja et al. [6] for further details).
5.2 Model and Deﬁnitions
Congestion Model
Some of the notation provided in this subsection is equivalent or similar to that
provided in Chapter 2. Furthermore, despite this chapter is essentially based on the
sub-class of unweighted games, we will give more general deﬁnitions holding for
weighted ones, too.
A (weighted) congestion model is deﬁned by a tuple
CM = (N,E,(ℓe)e∈E,(wi)i∈N,(Σi)i∈N),
where N is a set of n ≥2 players, E is a set of resources, ℓe : R≥0 →R≥0 is the
latency function of resource e ∈E, and, for each i ∈N, wi ≥0 is the weight of
player i and Σi ⊆2E \ /0 is her set of strategies. An unweighted congestion model is
a weighted congestion model such that wi = 1 for each i ∈N; in such case, we omit
the set of weighs from the tuple modeling CM. Other classes of congestion models
(e.g., load balancing congestion models, symmetric congestion models etc.) can be
deﬁned as in Chapter 2.
A strategy proﬁle is an n-tuple of strategies sss = (s1,s2,...,sn), that is a state
in which each player i ∈N adopts pure strategy si ∈Σi. When players adopt pure
strategies, CM induces a congestion game CG(CM) (usually, when CM is clear from
the context, we shall drop it from the notation). For a strategy proﬁle sss, the conges-
tion of resource e ∈E in sss, denoted as ke(sss) := ∑i∈N:e∈si wi, is the total weight of
the players using resource e in sss, (observe that, for unweighted games, ke(sss) coin-
cides with the number of users selecting resource e in sss). The cost of player i in sss is
deﬁned as costCG
i
(sss) = ∑e∈si ℓe(ke(sss)) (usually, when CG is clear from the context,
we shall drop it from the notation). The quality of a strategy proﬁle in CG(CM) is
measured by using the social function

74
5 Uniform Mixed Equilibria
SUM(sss) = ∑
i∈N
wicosti(sss) = ∑
e∈E
ke(sss)ℓe(ke(sss)),
that is, the weighted sum of the players’ costs. A pure Nash equilibrium for
CG(CM) is a strategy proﬁle sss such that, for any player i ∈N and strategy s′
i ∈Σi,
costi(sss) ≤costi(sss−i,s′
i). We denote by Eq(CG(CM)) the set of pure Nash equilib-
ria of a weighted congestion game CG(CM). The price of anarchy of a weighted
congestion game CG(CM) is deﬁned as
PoA(CG(CM)) =
max
sss∈Eq(CG(CM))
SUM(sss)
SUM(sss∗),
where sss∗is a social optimum for CG(CM). Similarly, the price of stability is deﬁned
as
PoS(CG(CM)) =
min
sss∈Eq(CG(CM))
SUM(sss)
SUM(sss∗).
ρ-Uniform Mixed Strategies
A mixed strategy for player i is a probability distribution σi deﬁned over Σi, so
that σi(s) is the probability that player i plays strategy s ∈Σi. With a little abuse of
notation, we may also use σi to denote the random variable equal to a strategy s with
probability σi(s). We denote by supp(σi) = {s ∈Σi : σi(s) > 0} the support of σi,
that is, the set of strategies played with positive probability in σi. A mixed proﬁle σσσ
is an n-tuple of mixed strategies, i.e., σσσ = (σ1,σ2,...,σn). Informally, σσσ is a state in
which each player i ∈N picks her strategy according to probability distribution σi,
independently from the choices of the other players. If σi is such that a pure strategy
si is picked with probability 1 by player i, we write si instead of σi. The following
deﬁnition provides the notion of ρ-uniform strategy, and the strategic behavior of
the games considered here is based on this concept.
Deﬁnition 5.1 (ρ-uniform mixed strategy). Given an integer ρ ≥1 and a weighted
congestion model CM in which for each player i ∈N there exist at least ρ pairwise
disjoint strategies in Σi, a ρ-uniform mixed strategy for player i is a mixed strategy
σi such that |supp(σi)| = ρ, s1 ∩s2 = /0 for any s1,s2 ∈supp(σi) with s1 ̸= s2, and
σi(s) = 1/ρ for each s ∈supp(σi), i.e., a mixed strategy in which player i plays
exactly ρ pairwise disjoint strategies with uniform probability.
Denote by ∆ρ
i (CM) the set of ρ-uniform mixed strategies for player i. A ρ-uniform
mixed proﬁle σσσ = (σ1,σ2,...,σn) is an n-tuple of ρ-uniform mixed strategies, one
for each player. When players adopt ρ-uniform mixed strategies, CM induces a ρ-
uniform congestion game ρ-CG(CM) (again, when CM is clear from the context,
we shall drop it from the notation). For a ρ-uniform mixed proﬁle σσσ, the expected
congestion of resource e ∈E in σσσ, denoted as ke(σσσ) := Esss∼σσσ

∑i∈N:e∈si wi

, is the
expected total weight of the players using resource e in σσσ. The cost of player i in σσσ

i ∈N and ρ-uniform mixed strategy σ′
i ∈∆ρ
i (CM), costi(σσσ) ≤costi(σσσ−i,σ′
i ), that
is, no player can lower her cost by unilaterally deviating to another ρ-uniform
mixed strategy. We denote by Eq(ρ-CG(CM)) the set of ρ-uniform mixed equilib-
ria of a weighted congestion game ρ-CG(CM). The price of anarchy of a ρ-uniform
weighted congestion game ρ-CG(CM) is deﬁned as
PoAρ(ρ-CG(CM)) =

σσσ∈Eq(ρ-CG(CM))

where σσσ∗is a ρ-uniform social optimum for ρ-CG(CM), that is a ρ-uniform mixed
proﬁle minimizing the social function. Similarly, the price of stability becomes
PoSρ(ρ-CG(CM)) =
min
σσσ∈Eq(ρ-CG(CM)
SUM(σσσ)
SUM(σσσ∗).
Given a ρ-uniform mixed strategy σi, let E(σi) = S
s∈supp(σi) s denote the set of
resources contained by all strategies belonging to supp(σi)1. For a ρ-uniform mixed
proﬁle σσσ, the ρ-maximum congestion of resource e in σσσ, denoted as kρ,e(σσσ) =
∑i∈N:e∈E(σi) wi, is the congestion of e obtained if each agent i assigning non-null
probability to a strategy si containing e decided to select s with probability 1 (that
is, if si was the strategy chosen by i in a pure strategy proﬁle).
5.3 Equilibrium Existence in ρ-Uniform Unweighted Games
In this section, we consider the case of ρ-uniform congestion games induced by
unweighted congestion models. First, we show that uniform mixed equilibria are
always guaranteed to exist for any class of latency functions. We achieve this re-
sult by deﬁning a transformation from an unweighted congestion model to another,
which induces an isomorphism between the ρ-uniform congestion game played on
the former and the congestion game played on the latter. A fundamental role in this
transformation is played by the following mapping among latency functions.
1 Given e ∈E(σi), there exists a unique strategy of σi containing e, since strategies selected with
non-null probability by each player are pairwise disjoint.

ping λℓ,ρ instantiated to a general afﬁne latency function.

⊓⊔
We are now ready to present our transformation. Let Λ be the function mapping CM
and ρ to another congestion model Λ(CM,ρ) deﬁned as follows. For any integer
ρ ≥1, and given CM = (N,E,(ℓe)e∈E,(Σi)i∈N) as input unweighted congestion
model, let
Λ(CM,ρ) = CM′ =
 N′,E′,(ℓ′

denote the unweighted congestion model obtained from CM, such that N′ = N,
E′ = E, Σ′
i = {E(σi) : σi is a ρ-uniform mixed strategy for player i in ρ-CG(CM)}
for each i ∈N, and ℓ′
e = λℓe,ρ for each e ∈E′. Moreover, for a ρ-uniform mixed
proﬁle σσσ for ρ-CG(CM), deﬁne sssρ(σσσ) as the strategy proﬁle for CG(Λ(CM,ρ))
such that
sssρ(σσσ) := (E(σ1),E(σ2),...,E(σn)),
i.e., each player i plays in CG(Λ(CM,ρ)) all the resources selected with positive
probability when playing strategy σi in game ρ-CG(CM).
By using map Λ, we show that any ρ-uniform unweighted congestion game can
be transformed into an equivalent unweighted congestion game.

As a consequence, we obtain the existence of uniform mixed equilibria for each uni-
form congestion game induced by an unweighted congestion model, regardless of
which are its latency functions. In particular, we extend Rosenthal’s Theorem [154],
by showing that, for each ρ ≥1, any ρ-uniform unweighted congestion game admits
an exact potential.
Theorem 5.2. For each ρ ≥1 and unweighted congestion model CM, ρ-CG(CM)
admits an exact potential.
Proof. Fix an integer ρ ≥1 and an unweighted congestion model CM. By Rosen-
thal’s Theorem [154], the function Φ deﬁned as
Φ(sss) := ∑
e∈E

for any (pure) strategy proﬁle sss of CG(Λ(CM,ρ)) and (pure) strategy bsi of player i in
CG(Λ(CM,ρ)). By exploiting the isomorphism (via map Λ) shown in Theorem 5.1,

78

one can easily show that the function Φ ◦sssρ is an exact potential function for
ρ-CG(CM) (i.e., costρ-CG

(σσσ) −costρ-CG
i
(σσσ−i, bσi) = Φ(sssρ(σσσ)) −Φ(sssρ(σσσ−i, bσi))
for any ρ-uniform strategy proﬁle σσσ of ρ-CG and any ρ-uniform strategy bσi of
player i in ρ-CG), and this concludes the proof.
⊓⊔
5.4 Performance of ρ-Uniform Unweighted Games
In this section we provide tight bounds on the price of anarchy and the price of
stability of ρ-uniform unweighted congestion games, and we focus on the particular
case of afﬁne latencies.
The Price of Anarchy for Afﬁne Latencies
In this subsection, we derive exact bounds on the price of anarchy of ρ-uniform
congestion games induced by afﬁne unweighted congestion models.
Theorem 5.3. Fix an afﬁne unweighted congestion model CM. For any ρ ≥1, we
have
PoAρ(ρ-CG(CM)) ≤

if ρ ≥4.
Proof. Given an integer ρ ≥1, let CM be an arbitrary afﬁne unweighted conges-
tion model. Similarly as in classical unweighted games, we can assume without
loss of generality that the latency functions are of type ℓe(x) = αex (see [22]). As
PoAρ(ρ-CG(CM)) = PoA(CG(Λ(CM,ρ))) (by Theorem 5.1), it is sufﬁcient show-
ing that the desired upper bound holds for PoA(CG(Λ(CM,ρ))).
Let sss = (s1,...,sn) and sss∗= (s∗
1,...,s∗
n) be a pure Nash equilibrium and a social
optimum for CG(Λ(CM,ρ)), respectively. By exploiting Lemma 5.1, we have that,
for each i ∈N, the inequality costi(sss) ≤costi(sss−i,s∗
i ) becomes

By applying the primal-dual method as in Example 3.1 and in Theorem 4.1, and
by exploiting Lemma 5.1 to explicate SUM(sss) and SUM(sss∗), we get the following
linear program in variables αes, whose optimal value is an upper bound on the price
of anarchy:

By setting k := ke(sss) and o := ke(sss∗) in (5.5), and multiplying both sides by ρ2, we
obtain the following stronger class of dual constraints in variables x,γ:
xk(k +ρ −1)−xo(k +ρ)+γo(o+ρ −1) ≥k(k +ρ −1),
∀k,o ∈N≥0.
(5.6)
To complete the proof, we are left to provide, for each ρ ≥1, a suitable value x ≥0
satisfying inequality (5.6) for any integers k,o ≥0, where γ is set to be equal to the
claimed upper bound on the ρ-uniform price of anarchy. We now proceed by case
analysis.
For ρ ≤2, for which we have γ =

ρ+1, set x = ρ+2
ρ+1. By substituting these values
in (5.6), we get the inequality k2 −k(o(ρ +2)+ρ +1)+ o(5o −ρ2 + 3ρ −5) ≥0
which can be easily shown to be satisﬁed for any integers k,o ≥0 when ρ = 1,2. In
fact, the discriminant of the associated equality is negative for each integer o ≥2,
while the cases of o ∈{0,1} can be checked by inspection.

which can be easily shown to be satisﬁed for any integers k,o ≥0. In fact, the
discriminant of the associated equality is negative for each integer o ≥2, while the
cases of o ∈{0,1} can be checked by inspection.
For ρ ≥4, for which we have γ = 4
3, set x = 4
3. By substituting these values in
(5.6), we get the inequality k2 −k(4o−ρ +1)+4o(o−1) ≥0 whose left-hand side
is increasing in ρ. Hence, we only need to prove that it gets satisﬁed for the case of
ρ = 4, by which we get the inequality k2 −k(4o−3)+4o(o−1) ≥0 which can be
easily shown to be satisﬁed for any integers k,o ≥0. Again, the discriminant of the
associated equality is negative for each integer o ≥2, while the cases of o ∈{0,1}
can be checked by inspection.
⊓⊔
Now, we get matching lower bounds for each ρ ≤3. We omit the case ρ ≥4, as in
the next subsection, we shall provide a matching lower bound holding even for the
price of stability and for load balancing models (see Theorem 5.7).
Theorem 5.4. For any ρ ≤3 and δ > 0, there exists an afﬁne unweighted congestion
model CM := CM(ρ,δ) such that
PoAρ(ρ-CG(CM)) ≥
(

2
√
7−1

−δ
if ρ = 3.
Proof. For ρ = 1, a matching lower bound has been given in [7, 12, 59]. For ρ = 2,3,
we simply need to deﬁne a congestion model d
CM whose latency functions are all
derived from linear ones and such that
PoA(CG(d
CM)) ≥

Indeed, by exploiting the isomorphism of Theorem 5.1, one can easily construct,
from d
CM, a ρ-uniform congestion game CM having the same price of anarchy.
To design d
CM, we resort to the same construction used in Theorem 4.9. Let
k1,k2,o1,o2 be four non-negative integers such that:
(k1,k2,o1,o2) =

where t is an arbitrary non-negative integer.
Let d
CM(k1,k2,o1,o2) be a general congestion model deﬁned as follows:
• we have a set N of n := max{k1 + o1,k2 + o2} players, and a set of resources
E := E1 ∪E2, where Ej :=

ej,1,...,ej,n
	
for any j ∈[2];
• each player i ∈N has two strategies si,s∗
i only, namely,
si := {e1,i,...,e1,i+k1−1}∪{e2,i,...,e2,i+k2−1} and
s∗
i := {e1,i+k1,...,e1,i+k1+o1−1}∪{e2,i+k2,...,e2,i+k2+o2−1},

where the resources’ indexes are cyclical (i.e., ej,i+n := ej,i);
• for any j ∈[2], the latency function of each resource e ∈Ej is deﬁned as ℓj(x) =
αj · g(x) for any x ≥0, where g(x) := x+ρ−1
ρ2
for any x ≥0, α1 := o2 · g(k2 +
1)−k2 ·g(k2), and α2 := k1 ·g(k1)−o1 ·g(k1 +1).
Observe that, by Lemma 5.1, ℓj(x) is derived according to ρ from αjx for any j ∈[2],
thus the latency functions of d
CM are all derived from linear ones.
Let sss and sss∗be the strategy proﬁles in which each player i ∈N plays strategy si
and s∗
i , respectively. We observe that ke(sss) = k j, ke(sss∗) = oj and ke(sss−i,s∗
i ) = kj +1,
for any resource e of group Ej (with j ∈[2]) and for any player i ∈N; furthermore,
the cost of any player i ∈N in sss (resp. sss∗, resp. (sss−i,s∗
i )) is α1k1g(k1)+ α2k2g(k2)
(resp. α1o1g(o1)+α2o2g(o2), resp. α1o1g(k1 +1)+α2o2g(k2 +1)). As
costi(sss) = α1k1g(k1)+α2k2g(k2) = α1o1g(k1 +1)+α2o2g(k2 +1) = costi(sss−i,s∗
i )
for any player i ∈N, we have that sss is a pure Nash equilibrium of CG(d
CM).
If ρ = 2, we have that
SUM(sss)
SUM(sss∗) = (α1k1g(k1)+α2k2g(k2))n
(α1o1g(o1)+α2o2g(o2))n = 5
3,
thus
PoA(CG(d
CM(k1,k2,o1,o2))) = 5
3.
Analogously, if ρ = 3, we have that the ratio SUM(sss)
SUM(sss∗) approaches
(α1k1g(k1)+α2k2g(k2))n
(α1o1g(o1)+α2o2g(o2))n = 2
√

for t going to inﬁnite (we recall that the values of k1 and o1 depends on t, if ρ = 3).
Thus, by choosing a sufﬁciently large t, we get
PoA(CG(d
CM(k1,k2,o1,o2))) ≥2

and this concludes the proof.
⊓⊔
Remark 5.1. The choice of parameters k1,k2,o1,o2 in the proof of Theorem 5.4 has
been “suggested” by the primal-dual approach. Indeed, consider the class of dual
constraints (5.6) used to show the upper bounds of Theorem 5.3, and let x,γ be the
(optimal) values of the dual variables considered in the related proof. For ρ = 2
(resp. ρ = 3) the above dual constraint is tight (resp. asymptotically tight for t →∞)
if (k,o) = (k1,o1), and it is also tight if (k,o) = (k2,o2). Thus, by adopting a similar
approach as in Example 3.1, we are able to construct a simpliﬁed version of the
primal program LP as that considered in Theorem 5.3, but with two resources only,
such that k1(sss) = k1, k1(sss∗) = o1, k2(sss) = k2, k2(sss∗) = o2, and such that the primal

82
5 Uniform Mixed Equilibria
constraint (5.3) is tight. Such a linear program has “suggested” the exact structure
of the lower bounding instance d
CM(k1,k2,o1,o2).
The Price of Anarchy for General Latency Functions
In this subsection, we give the main intuitions on how to determine the price of anar-
chy for general unweighted congestion models, thus extending the results obtained
for afﬁne latency functions. To this aim, we resort to the machinery presented in
Chapter 4.
We observe that Theorem 5.1 establishes an isomorphism (via map Λ) between
games ρ-CG(CM) and CG(Λ(CM,ρ)), and allows us to treat any ρ-uniform un-
weighted congestion game with latency functions in a given class C, as a classical
unweighted games whose latency functions are derived according to ρ from laten-
cies in C. Hence, we can exploit the results of Theorem 4.9 to get tight upper and
lower bounds on the price of anarchy for ρ-uniform unweighted congestion games
with general latency functions. In particular, we get that the tight bound on the price
of anarchy of ρ-uniform unweighted games with latency functions in C is equal to
γU(PoAε,Cρ), where γU is deﬁned as in Section 4.5 and Cρ := {λℓ,ρ : ℓ∈C} is the
set of latencies derived from C according to ρ. Furthermore, the map Λ can be easily
(and slightly) modiﬁed to preserve the load balancing structure of the game. Then,
by applying Theorem 4.7, one can provide tight lower bounds holding even for
load balancing games, if the considered latency functions are closed under ordinate-
scaling.
We point out that the results obtained for the case of afﬁne latencies in the pre-
vious section can be reinterpreted in terms of this general framework. Indeed, the
upper bound provided in Theorem 5.3 coincides with γU(PoAε,P(1)ρ), so that the
lower bounding instance is automatically guaranteed by our ﬁndings (which hold
for more general latency functions). We also observe that the lower bounding in-
stance provided in Theorem 5.4 coincides with the lower bounding instance of The-
orem 4.9, in which the opportune choice of the parameters k1,k2,o1,o2, f1, f2 sat-
isfying Lemma 4.4 is that considered in the proof of Theorem 5.4 (with f1 and f2
being the latency functions derived from the f(x) = x, according to ρ).
Price of Stability for Afﬁne Functions
In this subsection, we exhibit exact bounds on the price of stability of ρ-uniform
congestion games induced by afﬁne unweighted congestion models.
Theorem 5.5. Fix an afﬁne unweighted congestion model CM. For any ρ ≥1, we
have

Proof. Given an integer ρ ≥1, let CM be an arbitrary afﬁne unweighted congestion
model. Again, we can assume without loss of generality that the latency functions
are of type ℓe(x) = αex (i.e., linear). As PoAρ(ρ-CG(CM)) = PoA(CG(Λ(CM,ρ)))
(by Theorem 5.1), it is sufﬁcient showing that the desired upper bound holds for
PoA(CG(Λ(CM,ρ))). We recall that, by Rosenthal’s Theorem [154], the function
Φ deﬁned as
Φ(sss) := ∑
e∈E

∑
j=1
λℓe,ρ(ke(sss)) = ∑

is a potential function of CG(Λ(CM,ρ)), where the second equality follows from
Lemma 5.1; thus, any global minimum of Φ is a pure Nash equilibrium. Let sss and
sss∗be a pure Nash equilibrium minimizing the potential function Φ and a social
optimum for CG(Λ(CM,ρ)), respectively, so that the following inequality holds:
Φ(sss) ≤Φ(sss∗). By deﬁnition of Φ, this inequality can be equivalently written as

By adding it to the formulation used within the proof of Theorem 5.3 for upper

For ρ ≥4, the claim follows by Theorem 5.3. For each ρ ≤3, as done in The-
orem 5.3 for the price of anarchy, there are suitable x,y ≥0 satisfying inequality
(5.11) for any integers k,o ≥0, where γ is set to be equal to the claimed upper bound
on the ρ-uniform price of stability. In particular, such values are γ = 1 +

x =

⊓⊔
In the proof of Theorem 5.3, as the dual variables are two (i.e. x,γ), their optimal
values are determined by ﬁnding two pairs (k1,o1) and (k2,o2) for which the dual
constraints are tight. Instead, in the proof of Theorem 5.5 (for ρ ≤3), the dual vari-
ables are three (i.e., x,y,γ), and their optimal values can be determined by ﬁnding
three distinct pairs (k1,o1),(k2,o2) and (k3,o3). These three pairs again suggest how
to design a congestion game that provides a lower bound, and the considered high-
level structure is similar to those used in [60]. Thus, we get the following theorem.
Theorem 5.6. For each ρ ≤3 and δ > 0, there exists an afﬁne unweighted conges-
tion model CM := CM(ρ,δ) such that PoSρ(ρ-CG(CM)) ≥1+
1
√2ρ+1 −δ.
For ρ ≥4, both the price of anarchy and the price of stability are upper bounded
by 4/3, that is by the price of anarchy of afﬁne non-atomic games. Thus, to show
tight bounds, one can simply transform the tight lower bound instance for classi-
cal afﬁne non-atomic congestion games, that is a simple symmetric load balancing
game, into a ρ-uniform congestion game having the same price of anarchy, and the
same combinatorial structure of the players’ strategic space. Then, the following
theorem easily follows.
Theorem 5.7. For each ρ ≥1 and δ > 0, there exists an afﬁne unweighted symmet-
ric load balancing model CM := CM(ρ,δ) such that PoSρ(ρ-CG(CM)) ≥4
3 −δ.

5.5 Concluding Remarks and Related Work

5.5 Concluding Remarks and Related Work
The results presented in this chapter are based on the work of Bil`o et al. [35]. There,
together with the results for unweighted games, it is also analyzed the existence of
equilibria and the efﬁciency of the more general ρ-uniform weighted congestion
games. In particular, Bil`o et al. [35] prove that ρ-uniform mixed equilibria do exist
in afﬁne weighted congestion games, for each ρ ≥1. This generalizes to every value
of ρ the results in Fotakis et al. [90], Harks [100] and Panagopoulou and Spirakis
[142] which were proved for the classical setting in which agents adopt pure strate-
gies, i.e., for ρ = 1. Then, for each ρ ≥1, by exploiting the primal-dual method,
they derive tight bounds on the price of anarchy of ρ-uniform mixed equilibria in
afﬁne weighted congestion games (see the values reported in Table 5.1, where the
lower bounds for weighted games hold even for parallel-link networks). It is worth
noticing that such results nicely extend the ones previously obtained in the literature
for pure Nash equilibria, i.e., the case of ρ = 1.
Analogously to ρ-uniform congestion games, there are other research works in
which afﬁne congestion games have been generalised according to a certain proba-
bilistic framework (see, for instance, Piliouras et al. [151], Bil`o and Vinci [28], and
Cominetti et al. [75]). In the work of Piliouras et al. [151], the price of anarchy of
afﬁne unweighted congestion games in which the users of a resource are scheduled
in a random order and the cost of each agent is deﬁned as the sum of her completion
time on each selected resource is evaluated. These games happen to coincide with
our model with ρ = 2. Thus, our ﬁndings provide a tight characterization of the price
of stability for their model which was not investigated under this best-case metric.
Bil`o and Vinci [28] considered a generalization of the model deﬁned by Piliouras et
al. [151], in which users generally belong to different priority classes, and the users
belonging to the same class and selecting the same resource are again scheduled in
a random order.
In the work of Cominetti et al. [75], which appeared after the publication of
[35], the price of anarchy of afﬁne unweighted congestion games in which agents
may participate according to a certain probability is characterized. In this case, the
model presented in this chapter happens to coincide with their games when this
probability is of the form 1/ρ, for any positive integer ρ. A general cost model
for congestion games that can capture in a uniﬁed manner all these phenomena has
been put forward by Kleer and Sch¨afer [109], and bounds on the price of anarchy
and the price of stability have been given for the case of afﬁne unweighted games.
Another general congestion model in which the agents assigned to each resource are
scheduled randomly has been introduced and studied by Penn et al. [146, 147].
Ashlagi et al. [9] investigate symmetric afﬁne congestion games under the as-
sumption that the number of participating agents may be unknown. They consider
the notion of safety-level equilibrium deﬁned by Aghassi and Bertsimas [5] and
show that agents may beneﬁt from the common ignorance about the number of par-
ticipants.

Chapter 6
Non-atomic Congestion Games with θ-Similar
Strategies
What route should I choose to go to work? This is a fundamental question that
millions of people ask themselves daily, especially in metropolitan areas where the
set of possible alternatives may be considerably diversiﬁed. In an ideal situation in
which travel time is not affected by trafﬁc, everyone would select the fastest path.
However, when some roads become heavily congested, the ideal travel time may
tremendously increase and some people may prefer taking longer detours to avoid
trafﬁc delay. As every worker can be seen as a selﬁsh and rational agent who is only
interested in minimizing its travel time, this type of problems gets suitably modeled
as non-cooperative strategic games, usually called routing games, and coincide with
the model of non-atomic congestion games deﬁned in Chapter 2.
In this chapter, we focus on the well-studied case of afﬁne functions, and inves-
tigate to what extent the price of anarchy is affected by the similarities among the
players’ strategies. Our notion of similarity is modeled by assuming that, given a
parameter θ ≥1, the costs of any two strategies available to a same player, when
evaluated in absence of congestion, are within a factor θ one from the other. In par-
ticular, we show that the price of anarchy of non-atomic games with afﬁne functions
and θ-similar strategies is exactly

to inﬁnity, improvements on the 4

can be obtained for any ﬁnite value of θ. Furthermore, we show that the price of
anarchy of simple Pigou’s networks (i.e., symmetric load balancing games with two
resources only) with θ-similar strategies drops to
4θ
3θ+1 and coincides with that of
general games only if θ ∈{1,∞}. See Figure 6.1 for some numerical comparisons.

6.1 Model and Deﬁnitions
For general non-atomic games, we recall the model and the related concepts (e.g.,
pure Nash equilibria, price of anarchy, etc.) from Chapter 2 (in particular, from
Section 2.5).
Deﬁnition 6.1 (Congestion Game with θ-similar strategies). Given θ ≥1, a non-
atomic congestion game with θ-similar strategies NCG(θ) is a congestion game in
which, for each i ∈N and strategies S,S′ ∈Σi, it holds that
∑
e∈S
ℓe(0) ≤θ ∑
e∈S′
ℓe(0),
i.e., all the strategies available to players of type i, when evaluated in absence of
congestion, are within a factor θ one from the other.
Observe that congestion games with θ-similar strategies are congestion games obey-
ing some special properties. Thus, all positive results holding for congestion games
carry over to such variants for any value of θ. Moreover, for θ = ∞, any congestion
game is a congestion game with θ-similar strategies.
6.2 PoA for General Games
In this section, by applying the primal-dual method, we derive bounds on the price
of anarchy of non-atomic congestion games with θ-similar strategies, for any θ ≥1,
without any restriction on the topology of the game, i.e., the players’ strategic space
is general. We start by showing a general upper bound.
Theorem 6.1. Let NCG(θ) be an arbitrary afﬁne non-atomic congestion game with
θ-similar strategies. Then:

6.2 PoA for General Games
89
Proof. Fix an arbitrary afﬁne non-atomic congestion game with θ-similar strategies
NCG(θ) := (N,E,(ℓe)e∈E,(ri)i∈N,(Σi)i∈N).
Assume that 1 ≤θ < 4
3 or 4
3 < θ. Let σσσ := (σi,S)i∈N,S∈Σi and σσσ∗:= (σ∗
i,S)i∈N,S∈Σi
be a pure Nash equilibrium and a social optimum of NCG(θ), respectively. As the
latency functions are afﬁne, we can set ℓe(x) := αex+βe for any resource e ∈E, for
some αe,βe ≥0. As usual, we denote ke(σσσ) and ke(σσσ∗) with ke and oe, respectively.
Observe that we can assume without loss of generality that all players of the same
type play the same strategy Si in σσσ, and play the same strategy S∗
i in σσσ∗, so that
σi,Si = σ∗
i,S∗
i . Indeed, if it is not the case, it is sufﬁcient splitting the players of each
type in several sub-types in such a way that the above property holds. By applying
the primal-dual method, we get the following linear program in variables αes and
βes, whose optimal value is an upper bound on PoA(NCG(θ)):

the other quantities are ﬁxed parameters;
• (6.4) normalizes the optimal total latency SUM(σσσ∗), so that, analogously to
Example 3.1, the maximum value of the objective function is an upper bound

By taking the dual of LP, in which we associate the dual variable x to the primal con-
straint (6.2), the dual variable y to the primal constraint (6.3), and the dual variable

all the constraints in (6.7) and (6.8) are veriﬁed for any ke,oe ∈R≥0. First of all,
since x ≥1 and y ≥0, we trivially get that the dual constraints are satisﬁed by
oe = 0. Thus, we just consider these constraints with oe > 0. By rewriting DLP in
terms of variable t := ke/oe ≥0, and by eliminating variable y, we get the following
stronger class of dual constraints:

(6.9)
γ ≥(1−x+yθ)t +x−y ≥0, ∀t ≥0,
(6.10)
and one can easily prove that these inequalities are satisﬁed for any t > 0, thus
showing the claim.

Finally, if θ = 4
3, it sufﬁces considering the limit values, for θ tending to 4
3, of
all the quantities deﬁned above, and the claim holds as well.
⊓⊔
Remark 6.1. The values assigned to x, y and γ (in the proof of Theorem 6.1) have
been chosen in such a way that all the constraints of type (6.7) and (6.8) are satisﬁed,
and such that γ is minimized. Furthermore, by using this assignment, we have that
constraint (6.8) is tight if (ke,oe) = (1,0) or (ke,oe) = (0,1), and constraint (6.7) is
tight if (ke,oe) = (ξ,1), where ξ is deﬁned as
ξ := ξ(θ) :=

By exploiting these facts, we also obtain that the considered assignment for the vari-
ables x, y and γ is the optimal solution of a dual program as in the proof of Theo-
rem 6.1, but with a unique constraint of type (6.7) parametrized by (ke,oe) = (ξ,1),
and two constraints of type (6.8) parametrized respectively by (ke,oe) = (1,0) and
(ke,oe) = (0,1):
DLP :

γ ≥ξ 2 +x

0 ≥1−x+yθ
γ ≥x−y
x,y ≥0.
Thus, by applying the Strong Duality Theorem to DLP, we get that the value as-
signed to γ (i.e., the upper bound shown in Theorem 6.1) is the optimal solution of
a simpliﬁed version of the primal program deﬁned in Theorem 6.1, but with three
variables α,β1,β2 only (associated respectively to the three constraints of DLP),
and such that the primal constraints are tight (this fact holds by the complemen-
tary slackness conditions, as both x and y are strictly positive). Thus, we get the
following linear program in variables α,β1,β2:
LP :
max
αξ 2 +β1
s.t.
αξ 2 +β1 = αξ +β2
β2 = θβ1
α +β2 = 1
α,β1,β2 ≥0.
Furthermore, the optimal assignments for α,β1,β2 are univocally determined by the
three tight constraints of LP, and such values have suggested the structure of a tight
lower bound.
Theorem 6.2. For any θ ≥1 and for any δ > 0, there exists an afﬁne non-atomic
congestion game with θ-similar strategies NCG(θ) such that:

Proof. Fix θ ≥1 and let ξ := ξ(θ) be the quantity deﬁned in Remark 6.1. For
simplicity, we ﬁrst assume that both θ and ξ are rational numbers. Let (α,β1,β2)
be the optimal solution of the linear program LP considered in Remark 6.1.
We shall construct a non-atomic congestion game with θ-similar strategies NCG
that is parametrized by α,β1,β2, and whose price of anarchy coincides with the
optimal value of LP. Thus, by the considerations done in Remark 6.1, it will auto-
matically match the upper bound of Theorem 6.11.
Let NCG be a non-atomic congestion game deﬁned as follows:
• let h be a non-negative integer such that ξh is integer, too;
• we have a set N of n := (ξ + 1)h types of players, each one having an amount
of ﬂow ri = 1
h2 , and a set of 2ξh + 2 resources E := E′ ∪{e1,e2}, with E′ =
{e′
1,...,e′
n};
• each player of type i has two strategies σi,σ∗
i only, deﬁned as
si := {e′
i,...,e′
i+ξh−1}∪{e1},
s∗
i := {e′
i+ξh,...,e′
i+ξh+h−1}∪{e2},
where the resources’ indexes are supposed to be cyclical (i.e., ej,i+n := ej,i);
• the latency function of resources e′ ∈E′ is deﬁned as ℓ′(x) = α · x, the latency
of each resource ej is deﬁned as ℓj(x) = β j, for j ∈[2].
We observe that NCG is a congestion games with θ-similar strategies. Indeed, by
exploiting the second constraint of LP, we have that
∑
e∈s∗
i
ℓe(0) = β2 = θβ1 = θ ∑

for any player of type i.
Let σσσ and σσσ∗be the strategy proﬁles in which each player of type i plays strat-
egy si and s∗
i respectively. We have that σσσ is a pure Nash equilibrium. Indeed, by
exploiting the ﬁrst constraint of LP, we get

α,β1,β2, but their qualitative properties only (e.g., the fact that they satisfy all the constraints in
LP). This type of reasoning is often provided by the primal-dual approach, when deriving tight
lower bounds.

costi(σσσ) = αξ 2 +β1.

As the last member of the inequalities coincides with the optimal value of LP, by
Remark 6.1, we have that PoA(NCG) matches the upper bound of Theorem 6.1.
Finally, if the quantities θ and ξ := ξ(θ) used in the proof are not rational, it
is sufﬁcient considering, in place of θ, another value θ ′ < θ sufﬁciently close to
θ, such that both θ ′ and ξ := ξ(θ ′) are rational. By constructing the lower bound
instance according to these new values, the θ-similarity property is preserved, and
the resulting price of anarchy is equal to the upper bound of Theorem 6.1 up to a
negligible additive factor (as θ ′ is sufﬁciently close to θ).
⊓⊔
6.3 The Case of Pigou’s Networks
In this section, we provide the price of anarchy of θ-similar non-atomic congestion
games with afﬁne functions, when the topology is a Pigou’s network [150], that is
equal to a symmetric load balancing game with two resources only, and then, it is
the simplest possible topology. We have the following theorem:
Theorem 6.3. Let LB(θ) be an arbitrary symmetric load balancing game with two
resources, afﬁne latencies, and θ-similar strategies. Then PoA(LB) ≤
4θ
3θ+1.
Proof. Fix an arbitrary symmetric load balancing game LB(θ) with two resources
e1,e2. Assume without loss of generality that the total amount of players is unitary.
We have that ℓ1(x) = α1x + β1 and ℓ2(x) = α2x + β2, for some α1,α2,β1,β2 ≥0.
We can resort to the primal-dual approach, but without necessarily passing trough
the dual. Let x and y be the equilibrium and the optimal congestions of the ﬁrst
resource, respectively. We assume without loss of generality that x ≥y. To ﬁnd an
upper bound on the price of anarchy of LB(θ), it is sufﬁcient ﬁnding the maximum
value of the following linear program LP(x,y) in variables α1,α2,β1,β2,≥0.

6 Non-atomic Congestion Games with θ-Similar Strategies
where, as usual, the objective function coincides with the social cost of the equi-
librium, the ﬁrst constraint models some relaxed pure Nash equilibrium conditions,
the second constraint imposes some relaxed θ-similarity conditions, and the third
constraint normalizes the optimal social cost.
By standard arguments, one can show that the maximum value of LP(x,y) is
attained by setting α2 := 0 and by imposing the tightness of all the constraints;
under this choice, we have that α1x = (θ −1)β1, β2 = θβ1, and β1 is such that the
normalization constraint holds. By using these facts, and by simple calculations, we
get that the optimal value is equal to
α1x2 +β1x+α2(1−x)2 +β2(1−x)
α1y2 +β1y+α2(1−y)2 +β2(1−y) = (θ −1)x2 −(θ −1)x+θ
(θ −1)y2/x+y+θ(1−y).
(6.11)
By standard computations, one can easily show that (6.11) is maximized by x = 1.
Then, by further optimizing over y, we get that y := 1
2 maximizes (6.11). Then, by
using these values of x and y in (6.11), we get that the maximum value of (6.11) is
4θ
3θ+1, and by the above considerations, this is an upper bound on PoA(LB).
⊓⊔
By reversing the proof arguments of Theorem 6.3, we can easily provide a tight
lower bound.
Theorem 6.4. There exists an arbitrary symmetric load balancing game LB(θ) with
two resources, afﬁne latencies and θ-similar strategies such that PoA(LB) =
4θ
3θ+1.
Proof. It is sufﬁcient considering a game LB as in the proof of Theorem 6.3, where
the coefﬁcients α1,α2,β1,β2, after a proper rescaling, are such that the linear pro-
gram LP(x,y) is maximized, where x and y are set equal to 1 and 1/2, respectively,
i.e., we can set α1 := (θ −1)β1, α2 := 0, β2 := θβ1, and β1 := 1 in the latencies of
the considered game. As β2 := θβ1, we have that the game is with θ-similar strate-
gies. By reusing the proof steps of Theorem 6.3, one can easily show that x = 1
and y = 1/2 are respectively the equilibrium and the optimal congestion of the ﬁrst
resource, and this turns into a price of anarchy of at least
4θ
3θ+1.
⊓⊔
6.4 Concluding Remarks and Related Work
This chapter is based on some results obtained by Bil`o and Vinci [29], who introduce
the new model of congestion games with θ-similar strategies, and study their price
of anarchy for both atomic and non-atomic afﬁne congestion games. The results on
non-atomic games have been improved and elegantly extended to the case of general
latency functions by Benita et al. [18]. In particular, they consider the equivalent
model of θ-free-ﬂow games, and provide quasi-explicit formulas for computing the
price of anarchy of general θ-free-ﬂow non-atomic congestion games with general
latency functions, which are tight even for non-symmetric load balancing games.
Furthermore, they provide quasi-explicit formulas for computing the exact price
of anarchy of parallel-link networks (i.e., symmetric load balancing games). As a

byproduct of their analysis, they characterize the worst-case price of anarchy of
classical non-atomic congestion games with homogeneous latencies (i.e., containing
latencies ℓwith ℓ(0) = 0 only), and show that it is already attained by parallel-link
networks. This has solved a long-standing open problem posed by Roughgarden
[155]. Furthermore, in [18] the authors also studied the road trafﬁc in Singapore by
analysing some data, with the further aim of validating the effectiveness of θ-free-
ﬂow games as new model for selﬁsh routing.

Chapter 7
Non-Atomic One-Round Walks
In this chapter, we translate the solution concept of one-round walks from atomic
congestion games to non-atomic ones, in order to describe what happens to the per-
formance of one-round walks when the contribution of each player to the social cost
is inﬁnitesimally small. To this aim, we deﬁne the solution concept of ε-approximate
non-atomic one-round walk starting from the empty state, in which there is a contin-
uous ﬂow of R > 0 selﬁsh players (instead of a discrete number of players) greedily
selecting their strategies with the aim of approximately minimizing their costs (up to
a factor of 1+ε), given the choices of their predecessors. In particular, we formally
deﬁne a non-atomic one-round walk as a family (σσσt)t∈[0,R] of (inﬁnite) strategy pro-
ﬁles such that each strategy proﬁle σσσt is a conﬁguration obtained when an amount
of t players (according to a given arrival ordering) has already entered the game, and
each player s ∈[0,t] has chosen irrevocably her best-response, with respect to the
strategy proﬁle σσσs (i.e., the partial conﬁguration realised at her arrival time). This
is similar to what happens when considering one-round walks in atomic games, in
which the players enter the game sequentially and select their best-response, but in
discrete-time steps. Furthermore, one can observe that the concept of non-atomic
one-round walk “approximates” in some way the behavior of its atomic counterpart,
so as a differential (or integral) equation can be used to approximate the behavior of
some equations recursively deﬁned.
To measure the performance of non-atomic one-round walks, analogously to the
price of anarchy for the solution concept of Nash equilibrium, we consider the com-
petitive ratio of ε-approximate non-atomic one-round walks starting from the empty
state, that is the highest ratio between the social value achieved by the ﬁnal outcome
of an ε-approximate non-atomic one-round walk and the optimal social value.
We derive an explicit formula to determine the ε-approximation ratio for conges-
tion games having general latency functions. Furthermore, we study this metric for
non-atomic congestion games with polynomial latencies, by proving a tight bound
of ((1+ε)(d +1))d+1, where d is the degree of the polynomial. Given that the (ex-
act and approximate) price of anarchy for these games has been shown to be equal
to Θ (d/log(d)) (Roughgarden [155]), this result shows that outcomes generated

7 Non-Atomic One-Round Walks
after one-round walks are worse (even asymptotically) than pure Nash equilibria in
terms of social welfare.
7.1 Model and Deﬁnitions
We recall the model of non-atomic congestion games from Chapter 2 (in particular,
from Section 2.5). Let
NCG = (N,E,(ℓe)e∈E,(ri)i∈N,(Σi)i∈N)
be an arbitrary non-atomic game. Let R := ∑i∈N ri denote the total amount of ﬂow
of the game. A function H : [0,R] →N such that H−1[{i}] is the union of intervals
of type [a,b[ or [a,R], and veriﬁes
R
H−1[{i}] ds = ri for each i ∈N, is called ordering
function.
Deﬁnition 7.1. Let τττ := [(σσσt)t∈[0,R],H] be a family of strategy proﬁles (with σσσt =
(σt
i,S)i∈N,S∈Σi) equipped with an ordering function H satisfying the following con-
ditions:
Condition 1: ∑S∈Σi σt
i,S =
R
[0,t]∩H−1[{i}] ds for each i ∈N and t ∈[0,R];
Condition 2: σt
i,S is non-decreasing in t, for any i ∈N and S ∈Σi.
Such τττ is called weak (non-atomic) one-round walk starting from the empty state.
Observe that σt
i,S, as a function from t ∈[0,R] to R≥0, has to be necessarily
non-decreasing and Lipschitz continuous with respect to t; furthermore, its right-
derivative, denoted as
∂+σt
i,S
∂t
, is well-deﬁned and non-negative for any t ∈[0,R],
i ∈N, S ∈Σi, and
∑
i∈N ∑
S∈Σi
∂+σt
i,S
∂t
= 1, ∀t ∈[0,R].
(7.1)
Informally speaking, a weak one-round walk models a family of strategy proﬁles
generated by a ﬂow of players sequentially selecting their strategies, in such a way
that, for any t ∈[0,R], an amount t of players has entered the game and, for any
i ∈N and strategy S, there is an amount σt
i,S of players of type i which have already
selected strategy S (Condition 1 of Deﬁnition 7.1), and these players cannot change
their strategy in subsequent steps (Condition 2 of Deﬁnition 7.1). Moreover, observe
that the underlying ordering function H deﬁnes the ordering in which the players
appear in the game. The strategy proﬁle generated by a weak one-round walk is σσσR,
that is the strategy proﬁle obtained when all players have entered the game.
Deﬁnition 7.2. An ε-approximate (non-atomic) one-round walk starting from the
empty state involving selﬁsh players (or ε-one-round walk, for brevity) is a weak
one-round walk τττ such that, for any t ∈[0,R], σt
H(t),S is right-increasing at t only
if strategy S minimizes, up to a factor 1 + ε, the cost of player H(t) in the partial
strategy proﬁle σσσt.

7.2 Competitive Ratio
99
Informally, an ε-one-round walk is a weak one-round walk in which, for any
t ∈[0,R], the player entering the game at time t (i.e., of type H(t)) selects an ε-
approximate best response with respect the partial strategy proﬁle σσσt. Given a con-
gestion game CG, let ORWs
ε(CG) be the set of strategy proﬁles generated by some
ε-approximate one-round walk in CG. The concept of competitive ratio is deﬁned
as in Section 2.4, but applied to the concept of non-atomic one-round walks deﬁned
here. We denote the competitive of ε-one-round walks of a game CG (resp. class G)
by CRs
ε(CG) (resp. CRs
ε(G)).
To illustrate the main deﬁnitions given in this section, we provide a clarifying
example.
Example 7.1. Consider a load balancing game CG with three resources e1,e2,e3,
having latency functions f1(x) = x, f2(x) = 2x and f3(x) = 4 respectively, and
with two types of players, such that r1 = 3, r2 = 4, Σ1 = {{e1},{e2}} and Σ2 =
{{e2},{e3}}. Consider the ordering function H such that H(t) = 1 if t < 3 and
H(t) = 2 if t ∈[3,7]. Let τττ := [(σσσt)t∈[0,R],H] be the weak one-round walk such that
• given t ∈[0,3), we have σt
1,{e1} = 2t/3, σt
1,{e2} = t/3, and σt
2,{e} = 0 for any
e ∈{e2,e3};
• σt
1,{e1} = 2, σt
1,{e2} = 1, σt
2,{e2} = t −3 and σt
2,{e3} = 0, if t ∈[3,4);
• σt
1,{e1} = 2, σt
1,{e2} = 1, σt
2,{e2} = 1 and σt
2,{e3} = t −4, if t ∈[4,7).
One can observe that τττ is a 0-one-round walk, and that the resulting strategy proﬁle
σσσ := σσσR is such that k1(σσσ) = k2(σσσ) = 2 and k3(σσσ) = 3.
7.2 Competitive Ratio
In this section, by using the primal-dual method in the same spirit as in Theo-
rem 4.1 from Chapter 4, we give a quasi-explicit formula to compute a tight bound
on CRs
ε(N(C)). We ﬁrst give some preliminary deﬁnitions. Given x ≥1, k > 0, o > 0,
and a latency function f, let
γN(CRs
ε,k,o, f) := k f(k)+x·βN(CRs
ε,k,o, f)
of(o)
,
(7.2)
where
βN(CRs
ε,k,o, f) := −
Z k
0 f(s)ds+(1+ε)of(k);

γN(CRs

7 Non-Atomic One-Round Walks
7.2.1 Upper Bound
We ﬁrst show that (7.4) is an upper bound on the competitive ratio.
Theorem 7.1. For any class of non-atomic congestion games G, we have that
CRs
ε(G) ≤γN(CRs
ε,G).
Proof. Let NCG ∈N(C) be a non-atomic congestion game. Let τττ = [(σσσt)t∈[0,R],H]
be an ε-one-round walk generating strategy proﬁle σσσ := σσσR, and let σσσ∗be the op-
timal strategy proﬁle of NCG. Let τττ∗be a weak one-round walk generating strategy
proﬁle σσσ∗, based on the same ordering function H of τττ, and such that, for any
t ∈[0,R], there exists a (unique) strategy S∗(t) such that
∂+σ∗,t
H(t),S∗(t)
∂t
= 1 (so that
∂+σ∗,t
i,S
∂t
= 0 if i ̸= H(t) or S ̸= S∗(t)). We observe that such a weak one-round walk
do exist.1
As usual, we set ke := ke(σσσ) and oe := ke(σσσ∗). We have that the maximum value
of the following linear program (with inﬁnitely many constraints parametrized by
t ∈[0,R]) in the variables αes is an upper bound on CRs

is right-increasing in t, and S∗(t) denotes the strategy of player H(t) such that
∂+σ∗,t
H(t),S∗(t)
∂t
= 1. Indeed, by setting αe = 1 for any e ∈E, we have that:
• the objective function of LP1 is the total latency SUM(σσσ);
• (7.5) holds since [(σσσt)t∈[0,R],H] is an ε-one-round walk, thus any strategy S for
which σt
H(t),S is right-increasing in t is necessarily an approximate best-response
for players of type H(t);
• (7.6) is the normalized optimal total latency SUM(σσσ∗).
1 To show the existence of such a weak one-round walk, it is sufﬁcient considering the following
continuous-time process. At each time t ∈[0,R), consider a strategy S∗∈ΣH(t) such that σ∗,t
H(t),S∗<
σ∗
H(t),S∗. Then, assign players of type H(t) to this strategy only, until either σ∗,t′
H(t′),S∗= σ∗
H(t′),S∗
holds, or H(t) ̸= H(t′), for some subsequent step t′ > t. Repeat this process with respect to the new
step t∗, and iterate it until the total amount of players R has been assigned.

7.2 Competitive Ratio
101
Now, we introduce some relaxations on LP1 to get a new linear program. As
ke(σσσt) is non-decreasing in t, we have that ke(σσσt) ≤ke, so that we can replace
(1 + ε)∑e∈S∗(t) αe fe(ke(σσσt)) with (1 + ε)∑e∈S∗(t) αe fe(ke) in (7.5) to obtain a new
relaxed constraint. Then, we can multiply each obtained constraint by the right-
derivative
∂+σt
i,S
∂t
. Furthermore, if S /∈ΣH(t),ε(σσσt) or i ̸= H(t), we have that σt
i,S is
constant in a right-neighborhood of t, and then ∂+
∂t σt
i,S = 0. Hence, we can extend
the new relaxed constraints constructed from (7.5) to strategies S /∈ΣH(t),ε(σσσt) and
types i ̸= H(t). Thus, the ﬁnal relaxed constraint that we can adopt in place of (7.5)
is the following:

To obtain a further relaxation of LP1, we can integrate each constraint of type (4.4)
with respect to variable t ∈[0,R], and then we can sum the integrated constraints
over i ∈N and S ∈Σi. Thus, we get the following inequalities:

ε(G) (by the Weak Duality
Theorem).
⊓⊔
7.2.2 Tight Lower Bound
In this subsection, we show that the upper bound provided in Theorem 7.1 is tight.
We ﬁrst give a preliminary lemma, whose claim and proof are similar to those of
Lemma 4.1 of Chapter 4.
Lemma 7.1. Let G be a class of non-atomic congestion games. For each M <
γW(CRs
ε,G) one of the following cases holds:
• Case 1: there exist a latency function f ∈C(G) and two rational numbers k,o >
0 such that

7.2 Competitive Ratio
103
M < k f(k)
of(o)
and βN(CRs
ε,k,o, f) ≥0.
• Case 2: there exist two latency functions f1, f2 ∈C(G) and four rational num-
bers k1,k2,o1,o2 > 0 such that
M < α1k1 f1(k1)+α2k2 f2(k2)
α1o1 f1(o1)+α2o2 f2(o2),
where α1 := βN(CRs
ε,k2,o2, f2) > 0 and α2 := −βN(CRs
ε,k1,o1, f1) > 0.
By using Lemma 7.1 and by resorting to a similar result as in Theorem 4.8,
for any ﬁxed M < γN(CRs
ε,G), one can provide a class of non-atomic load bal-
ancing games NCG := NCGs(k1,k2,o1,o2, f1, f2), parametrized by the parameters
k1,k2,o1,o2, f1, f2 of Lemma 7.1 and an integer s ≥1, such that, for a sufﬁciently
large s, CRs
ε(NCG) > M holds. This shows that γW(CRs
ε,G) is a tight lower bound
even for load balancing games, if the considered latency functions are closed under
ordinate-scaling.
Theorem 7.2. We have that γN(CRs
ε,N(C)) = CRs
ε(N(C)) = CRs
ε(NLB(C)) for any
class C of latency functions.
In the following theorem we show a weaker statement, and we provide a general
non-atomic congestion game as a tight lower bound.
Theorem 7.3. We have that γN(CRs
ε,N(C)) = CRs
ε(N(C)) for any class C of latency
functions.
Proof (Sketch). For the sake of simplicity, we provide the main intuitions on how to
construct the tight lower bound matching the competitive ratio of Theorem 7.1. In-
stead of providing a non-atomic game as a lower bound, we provide an unweighted
atomic game CGt,n as that deﬁned in Theorem 4.10, in which the number of players
selecting each resource is proportional to an integer parameter t ≥1, and the con-
tribution that each player gives to the congestion of each resource is proportional to
1/t. At the end of the proof, one can easily see that, for sufﬁciently large values of t,
the competitive ratio of CGt,n well approximates (with arbitrary precision) that of a
non-atomic congestion game NCGt,n obtained from CGt,n, by replacing each atomic
player with an amount of non-atomic ones and by adding further dummy resources
that preserve the players’ strategic behavior.
Fix M < γW(CRs
ε,G). Let k1,k2,o1,o2, f1, f2 be the parameters provided by
Lemma 7.1, where we set k1 = k2 = k, o1 = o2 = o, and f1 = f2 = f if the ﬁrst case
of the lemma holds. As k1,k2,o1,o2 are rational (by the hypothesis), by multiplying
such numbers by an opportune integer ˆt they become integers. For any integer t, let
CGt,n := CGn(k1,t,k2,t,o1,t,o1,t, f1,t, f1,t) be the parametric lower bounding instance
deﬁned in Theorem 4.10, where n := nt is a sufﬁciently large integer, kj,t := k j · ˆt ·t,
oj,t := oj · ˆt ·t, and ft, j(x) := f f (x/(ˆt ·t)) for any j ∈[2] and x ≥0. Let σσσt,n be the
strategy proﬁle generated by the ε-one-round walk in which each player i selects

104
7 Non-Atomic One-Round Walks
strategy si, and let σσσ∗
t,n be the strategy proﬁle in which each player i selects strategy
s∗
i , except for those players i who can choose si only.
By using a similar approach as in the proof of Theorem 4.10, one can show that
limsup
t→∞
limsup
n→∞
SUM(σσσt,n)
SUM(σσσ∗t,n) = α1k1 f1(k1)+α2k2 f2(k2)
α1o1 f1(o1)+α2o2 f2(o2) > M,
where α1 := βN(CRs
ε,k2,o2, f2) > 0 and α2 := −βN(CRs
ε,k1,o1, f1) > 0 if the sec-
ond case of Lemma 7.1 holds, and α1 := α2 := 1 otherwise.2 Thus, by taking sufﬁ-
ciently large t and n, we get CRs
ε(CGt,n) > M.
Finally, as observed at the beginning of the proof, if t and n are sufﬁciently large,
NCGt,n can be transformed into a non-atomic instance NCGt,n guaranteeing a com-
petitive ratio approximately equal to that of CGt,n (with arbitrary precision), so that
the resulting competitive ratio stays above M. By the arbitrariness of M, the claim
follows.
⊓⊔
7.2.3 Application to Polynomial Latency Functions
By using the fact that γN(CRs
ε,N(C)) is a tight bound on the competitive ratio, even
for load balancing instances if C is closed under ordinate-scaling, it is sufﬁcient
computing the exact value of γN(CRs
ε,N(P(d))) to provide tight bounds for the re-
stricted case of polynomial latency functions of maximum degree d.
Theorem 7.4. The competitive ratio of ε-one-round walks for the class of non-
atomic congestion games with polynomial latency functions of maximum degree
d ≥1 is ((1+ε)(d +1))d+1. This bound is tight even for load balancing games.
Proof. By standard calculations, one can show that

. Again by standard calculations,
one can show that, for x∗:= (d + 1)d, γ(x,t,h) is maximized by t∗= (1 + ε)(d +

ε,N(P(d))) is at most equal to γ∗:=
γ(x∗,t∗,d) = ((d +1)(1+ε))d+1.
Now, we show that γN(CRs
ε,N(P(d))) is exactly equal to γ∗= ((d + 1)(1 +
ε))d+1. By similar arguments as in Remark 4.2, we have that k f(k)
of(o) is a lower
bound on γN(CRs
ε,N(P(d))), if βN(CRs
ε,k,o, f) ≥0. We observe that, for k := t∗=
(1+ε)(d+1), o := 1, and f deﬁned as f(x) = xd, we get k f(k)
of(o) = ((d+1)(1+ε))d+1
and βN(CRs
ε,k,o, f) ≥0. Thus, we necessarily have that ((d + 1)(1 + ε))d+1 =
γN(CRs
ε,N(P(d))), and this shows the claim.
⊓⊔
7.3 Concluding Remarks and Related Work
The results presented in this chapter are based on the works of Vinci [174, 175]. In
particular, the results obtained in [174] are related to polynomial congestion games
only, and the work [174] extends the previous results from polynomial latencies to
general ones.
The framework considered in this chapter exhibits some similarities with an on-
line optimization setting considered by Harks et al. [102]. The authors of [102]
consider an online setting in which several fractions of the total players’ ﬂow arrive
sequentially, and each fraction must be irrevocably split among the feasible strate-
gies without knowing the future arrivals, so as to minimize the total latency when
all the ﬂow has been assigned. They focus on afﬁne network congestion games and
provide upper bounds on the competitive ratio guaranteed by the greedy algorithm,
that splits each fraction of the ﬂow so as to minimize the total latency; furthermore,
they provide lower bounds on the best competitive ratio that can be achieved by any
online algorithm.
Harks et al. [102] extended some of the above results to the case of polynomial
latencies of maximum degree d ≥1. In particular, they show that the competitive ra-
tio of the greedy algorithm is at most (d +1)d+1, and there are instances for which it
is d+1
d+12d+1. Despite the setting presented in this chapter is different from that stud-
ied by Harks et al. [102], one can show that the lower bound instances considered in
Theorem 7.2 and 7.3, after some minor modiﬁcations, can be reconsidered to show

106
7 Non-Atomic One-Round Walks
the tightness of the upper bound (d + 1)d+1 on the competitive ratio of the greedy
algorithm, thus improving on the previous lower bound of Harks et al. [102].

Part IV
Taxes and Other Strategies to Cope with
Selﬁsh Behavior

Chapter 8
Taxes for Congestion Games: Preliminaries
In Part III, we have focused on the performance of congestion games under differ-
ent efﬁciency metrics (price of anarchy, price of stability, competitive ratio), and the
presented results have shown that selﬁsh behavior produces suboptimal outcomes,
whose performance may be quite bad in certain cases. Thus, it becomes natural
to ask whether or nor the impact of selﬁsh behavior on the system efﬁciency can
be mitigated by an external mild intervention. Toward this end, the use of taxation
(Caragiannis et al. [52], Cole et al. [71], Pigou [150]) has been fruitfully proposed
and analyzed in the literature of congestion games. This approach aims at discour-
aging the use of certain (usually highly congested) resources by forcing players to
pay taxes for using them.
In this chapter, we provide the main deﬁnitions and the basic notation related
to taxation mechanisms, and we give some mathematical background about combi-
natorics and number theory that we shall use in the subsequent chapters to deﬁne
and analyze certain classes of taxes. We mainly focus on atomic congestion games;
anyway, the considered deﬁnitions can be easily adapted to the non-atomic case.
In the last section, we provide references to the literature of taxation in congestion
games and to some related settings. Several research works are not mentioned here,
as they are discussed in some of the subsequent chapters which they are connected
to.
8.1 Tax Functions
By following the setting of Caragiannis et al. [52], we consider the use of resource
taxation in order to mitigate the impact of selﬁsh behavior in weighted congestion
games.
Deﬁnition 8.1 (dynamic tax function). A dynamic tax function is a function δ :
E ×R2
≥0 →R≥0 that assigns a tax δe(w,ke) to each player of weight w that wishes
to use resource e ∈E in strategy proﬁle σσσ.

8 Taxes for Congestion Games: Preliminaries
By so doing, a congestion game CG extends to a new game (CG,δ) in which each
player i wants to minimize a new cost function bci(σσσ) = ci(σσσ)+∑e∈σi δe(wi,ke). In
such a setting, two new social functions are considered, so as to account also for the
amount of taxation introduced in the game: the total cost TC(σσσ) = ∑i∈N bci(σσσ) and
the weighted total cost WTC(σσσ) = ∑i∈N wibci(σσσ).
The tax function considered in Deﬁnition 8.1 is quite general (and powerful), as
it may depend on both the global structure of the game and the realized strategy pro-
ﬁle. The unique constraint to be satisﬁed is that taxes must be applied locally by each
resource to each player selecting it, despite tax-functions may be deﬁned globally.
One can clearly consider subclasses of the tax functions deﬁned in Deﬁnition 8.1,
which could be less powerful, but simpler. This is reasonable in any setting in which
a designer has a partial knowledge of the game or low computational power.
Deﬁnition 8.2. A dynamic tax function δe(w,ke) is based on a mixed strategy
proﬁle yyy whenever its dependence on e is restricted to the structure of the la-
tency function and the values E[ke(yyy)] and E[ne(yyy)] only, that is, δe(w,ke) :=
δℓe(w,E[ke(yyy)],E[ne(yyy)],ke), and if, for any latency functions f1, f2, and real num-
bers α1,α2 ≥0, the following linearity property holds:
δα1 f1+α2 f2(w,E[ke(yyy)],E[ne(yyy)],ke)
= α1δ f1(w,E[ke(yyy)],E[ne(yyy)],ke)+α2δf2(w,E[ke(yyy)],E[ne(yyy)],ke).
A natural choice for yyy, that we shall widely exploit in the subsequent chapters, is
that of an optimal strategy proﬁle.
Remark 8.1. Consider the efﬁciency of taxes for a given class G of congestion
games. If all latency functions in C(G) can be deﬁned as ℓe = ∑d
h=0 αe,hℓh, where
αe,h ≥0 and {ℓ1,ℓ2,...,ℓd} is a given set of latency functions, if we do not consider
particular restrictions on the players’ strategy space and if the considered taxes are
based on an optimal strategy proﬁle, we can also assume without loss of generality
that such taxes satisfy the linearity property, without worsening the efﬁciency. In-
deed, consider an arbitrary congestion game CG ∈G with latency functions of type
ℓe = ∑d
h=0 αe,hℓh, where we assume w.l.o.g. that each αh is rational. We can construct
an equivalent congestion game CG′ by replacing each resource e of CG with an op-
portune ﬁnite number me of new resources, where each resource of the new game
has latency functions belonging to {ℓ0,ℓ1,...,ℓd}, and the number of resources with
latency ℓh is proportional to αh. Let {δ0,δ1,...,δd} be a set of taxes (based on a
mixed strategy proﬁle) associated to the set of latency functions {ℓ0,ℓ1,...,ℓd}. If
we go back to the initial congestion game CG, we can assume that the tax function
δe associated to each resource ℓe is equal to ∑d
h=0 αe,hδh, and the efﬁciency of such
taxes is the same as that guaranteed in CG′ by taxes δ0,δ1,...,δd.
Example 8.1. An example of dynamic taxes based on a mixed strategy proﬁle for
congestion games with polynomial latency functions of maximum degree d is the
following: δe(w,ke) := ∑h∈[d]0 αe,h fh(w,E[ke(yyy)],E[ne(yyy)],ke), where αe,h is the co-
efﬁcient of the monomial xh in latency function ℓe (see Subsection 2.2), and for each
h ∈[d]0, fh : R4
≥0 →R≥0 is an arbitrary function.

8.1 Tax Functions
111
Deﬁnition 8.3 (universal tax function). A dynamic tax function δe(w,ke) is uni-
versal whenever its dependence on e is restricted to the structure of the latency
function only, that is, δe(w,ke) := δℓe(w,ke), and if the linearity property described
in Deﬁnition 8.2 holds.
Deﬁnition 8.4 (static tax function). A static tax function is a dynamic tax function
δe(w,ke) that does not depend on the resource congestions in σσσ, that is, δe(w,ke) :=
δe(w).
Observe that, by deﬁnition, a dynamic (resp. static) tax function is more power-
ful than a dynamic (resp. static) tax function based on a strategy proﬁle, which is
more powerful than a universal dynamic (resp. static) tax function; moreover, any
dynamic tax function of a certain type is more powerful than any static tax function
of the same type. We denote with TAXMSP(G) the set of all possible dynamic tax
functions based on a mixed strategy proﬁle that can be deﬁned for the class of games
G and with TAXOPT(G) the set of all possible dynamic tax functions based on an
optimal strategy proﬁle that can be deﬁned for the class of games G.
8.1.1 Efﬁciency of Taxation
As proposed by Cole et al. [71], two types of taxes may be considered: refundable
and non-refundable ones. Refundable taxes are assumed to be returned to the players
(for instance, as a lump-sum refund) and, for this reason, they do not contribute to
the system disutility. Hence, the quality of a strategy proﬁle in game (CG,δ) is
measured by making use of the social functions TL and WTL. For non-refundable
taxes, instead, social functions TC and WTC are used.
For a certain solution concept SC, let SC(CG,δ) be the set of strategy proﬁles
implementing SC in game (CG,δ).
Deﬁnition 8.5 (efﬁciency of refundable and non-refundable taxes). A tax func-
tion δ is a ρ-efﬁcient refundable tax for the weighted congestion game CG with
respect to the solution concept SC and to the social function SF ∈{TL,WTL}, if
SF(σσσ) ≤ρ ·SF(σσσ∗) for each σσσ ∈SC(CG,δ). A tax function δ is a ρ-efﬁcient non-
refundable tax for the weighted congestion game CG with respect to the solution
concept SC and to the social function TC (resp. WTC), if TC(σσσ) ≤ρ · TL(σσσ∗)
(resp. WTC(σσσ) ≤ρ ·WTL(σσσ∗)) for each σσσ ∈SC(CG,δ).
We observe that the efﬁciency of a refundable (resp. non-refundable) tax function
for a game CG is a concept analogue to price of anarchy, but the underlying solution
concept SC is implemented by strategy proﬁles of the taxed game SC(CG,δ) and
the considered social function is SF ∈{TL,WTL} (resp. SF ∈{TC,WTC}).

8 Taxes for Congestion Games: Preliminaries
8.2 Mathematical Background on Combinatorics
In this subsection, we give an overview of the mathematical background on com-
binatorics and number theory, that we shall use in the following to determine and
analyze the efﬁciency of some tax functions. For all the results claimed in this sec-
tion, see Mansour and Schork [122].
Deﬁnition 8.6 (generalised Stirling numbers of the second kind). Given a pair of
non-negative integers (i, j) and α ∈R, the generalised Stirling number of the second
kind Sα(i, j) is deﬁned by using the following recurrence:
Sα(0,0) = 1,
Sα(i,0) = Sα(0,i) = 0
∀i ∈N,
(8.1)
Sα(i+1, j) = ( j +α −1)Sα(i, j)+Sα(i, j −1).
(8.2)
By setting α = 1 we obtain the well-known Stirling numbers of the second kind,
simply denoted as S(i, j), which measure the number of different ways of partition-
ing a set of i elements into j non-empty subsets.
Example 8.2. S(3,2) = 3 since the set {x,y,z} can be partitioned into two subsets in
three different ways as {{x},{y,z}}, {{y},{x,z}} and {{z},{x,y}}.
Deﬁnition 8.7 (Touchard polynomials). For a positive integer i, the ith Touchard
(or Bell) polynomial Bi(x) is deﬁned as Bi(x) := ∑i
j=0 S(i, j)x j.
By Dobi´nski’s formula, we have
Bi(x) = e−x

Deﬁnition 8.8 (geometric polynomials). The ith Geometric (or Euler) polynomial
Ei(x) is deﬁned as Ei(x) := ∑i
j=0 S(i, j)j!x j.
By Euler’s formula, we have

f(x) = f(x). It
is immediate to see that, for any value x ∈R, both Bi(x) and Ei(x) are increasing
functions of i.
Deﬁnition 8.9 (forward difference). The ith forward difference of function f(x) is
the function ∆i recursively deﬁned as follows: ∆i+1 [f(x)] = ∆i [f(x+1)]−∆i [f(x)]
with ∆0 [f(x)] = f(x).

8.3 Related Work
Relatively to the atomic setting, Caragiannis et al. [52] give several results regard-
ing the existence and the computability of efﬁcient static tax functions with respect
to pure and mixed Nash equilibria in congestion games with afﬁne latencies. They
show how to compute 2-efﬁcient refundable taxes based on optimal strategy proﬁles,
with respect to mixed Nash equilibria and for weighted games, and (1 + 2/
√
3)-
efﬁcient universal refundable taxes with respect to pure Nash equilibria for un-
weighted games. These results hold for both the weighted total latency and the total
latency social functions. The former is tight since it is shown that even singleton
unweighted games on identical machines do not admit (2 −ε)-efﬁcient taxes with
respect to mixed Nash equilibria (even though determining a matching lower bound
for pure Nash equilibria is left as an open problem), while the latter is based on a uni-
versally static tax function and, under this restriction, it is shown to be tight either.
For singleton and symmetric unweighted games, 1-efﬁcient (i.e., optimal) refund-
able taxes can be computed with respect to pure Nash equilibria and this result holds
even for congestion games with non-decreasing latency functions. On the negative
side, several lower bounds are provided with respect to pure Nash equilibria. For
singleton games with identical resources, no (11/10−ε)-efﬁcient refundable taxes
are possible when the players are unweighted, with the bound rising to 9/8−ε for
weighted players and symmetric games; moreover, for non-singleton unweighted
games, it becomes 6/5−ε.
For singleton weighted games on identical resources, (1 +
√
2)-efﬁcient non-
refundable taxes with respect to mixed Nash equilibria and the weighted total cost
are shown to exist. Furthermore, if the number of resources is constant, a (1+
√
2+
ε)-efﬁcient tax function can be computed in polynomial time. With respect to the
total cost, 4-efﬁcient non-refundable taxes with respect to mixed Nash equilibria are
shown to exist, while (6 + ε)-efﬁcient non-refundable taxes with respect to mixed
Nash equilibria can be computed in polynomial time.

8 Taxes for Congestion Games: Preliminaries
Other results regarding the existence and computation of efﬁcient taxes in con-
gestion games under particular restrictions can be found in the works of Chen et al.
[58], Fotakis and Spirakis [89], Jelinek et al. [107], Meir and Parkes [125], Ord´o˜nez
and Stier-Moses [135], Sandholm [163], Singh [168].
Taxes for non-atomic congestion games have been studied long before those
deﬁned for atomic congestion games. Indeed, Beckmann et al. [17] prove that
the marginal cost taxation, introduced by Pigou [150], ensures the optimality of
Nash equilibria in non-atomic congestion games, i.e. a price of anarchy equal to 1.
Marginal cost taxation is deﬁned in such a way that the latency function of each
player is equal to increase she causes to the social welfare, due to her presence in
the game, and can be implemented as a universal tax function; in non-atomic con-
gestion games can be implemented as a constant (non-universal) tax function, too.
In subsequent works, the existence and the computation of efﬁcient taxes in many
variants of non-atomic congestion games has been intensively studied (see, for in-
stance, Brown and Marden [44, 45, 46], Cole et al. [70, 71], Colini-Baldeschi et al.
[73], Ferguson et al. [84, 85], Fleischer et al. [87], Meir and Parkes [126], Swamy
[171]).

Chapter 9
Dynamic Taxes for Congestion Games with
Polynomial Latencies
In this chapter, we consider the efﬁciency of taxation in congestion games with
polynomial latency. By resorting to a novel application of the primal-dual method,
we provide interesting upper bounds with respect to a variety of different solution
concepts ranging from approximate pure Nash equilibria up to approximate coarse
correlated equilibria, and including also approximate one-round walks starting from
the empty state. Our ﬁndings show a high beneﬁcial effect of taxation, which in-
creases more than linearly with the degree of the latency functions. In some cases, a
tight relationship with some well-studied polynomials in Combinatorics and Num-
ber Theory, such as the Touchard and the Geometric polynomials, arises (see Sec-
tion 8.2 for further details). In these cases, we can also show matching lower bounds,
albeit under mild assumptions; interestingly, our upper bounds are derived by ex-
ploiting the combinatorial deﬁnition of these polynomials, while our lower bounds
are constructed by relying on their analytical characterization.
Recall notations from Section 8.2. For either weighted and unweighted games,
we determine Bd+1(1+ε)-efﬁcient taxes based on a social optimum with respect to
ε-approximate equilibria and to both the total latency and the weighted total latency.
We also show that this is the best possible efﬁciency achievable by a tax function
based on a social optimum even in unweighted games. From a computational point
of view, we show how to compute in polynomial time (1+ξ)Bd+1(1+ε)-efﬁcient
taxes in unweighted games, for any arbitrary ξ > 0. Still for unweighted games,
we determine Ed+1(1+ε)-efﬁcient taxes based on a social optimum with respect to
ε-approximate one-round walks starting from the empty state and show that this is
the best possible efﬁciency achievable by a tax function based on a social optimum.
Also in this case, we show how to compute in polynomial time (1+ξ)Ed+1(1+ε)-
efﬁcient taxes, for any arbitrary ξ > 0. Interestingly, our upper bounds are derived
by exploiting the combinatorial deﬁnition of the polynomials Bi(x) and Ei(x), while
our lower bounds are constructed by relying on their analytical characterization.
Finally, for weighted games, we determine Zd+1(1 + ε)-efﬁcient taxes based on a
social optimum with respect to ε-approximate one-round walks starting from the
empty state and to the weighted total latency.

9 Dynamic Taxes for Congestion Games with Polynomial Latencies
Furthermore, we consider taxation for non-atomic congestion games, too. In
Chapter 7, we have introduced and analyzed the solution concept of ε-approximate
non-atomic one-round walks, and we have shown that outcomes generated by one-
round walks in polynomial congestion games are very bad in terms of social wel-
fare, and that they are worse (even asymptotically) than the efﬁciency of pure Nash
equilibria (i.e., the price of anarchy). By resorting to dynamic taxation, we lower
the ε-competitive ratio of polynomial congestion games with maximum degree p to
(1+ε)p+1(p+1)!.
For non-refundable taxes and weighted games, we determine taxes which are

respect to ε-approximate equilibria and to the total cost and Qd+1(1 + ε)-efﬁcient
taxes based on a social optimum with respect to ε-approximate one-round walk
starting from the empty state and to the weighted total cost.
For a quantitative comparison of the results presented in this chapter, see the
values reported in Tables 9.1 and 9.2, where PNE and ORW stand for pure Nash
equilibria and one-round walks starting from the empty state, respectively.

9.1 Primal Formulation and Characteristic Inequalities
In this section, we provide the basic inequalities, to be used within the primal-dual
method, characterizing the properties of ε-approximate pure Nash equilibria and ε-
approximate one-round walks starting from the empty state in weighted congestion
games with polynomial latencies under the application of dynamic tax functions.
We assume, without loss of generality, that all players’ weights are at least equal to
one. This assumption can be done because of the following remark, holding even for
more general classes of latency functions which are closed under abscissa-scaling:
Remark 9.1. Suppose that C is closed under ordinate and abscissa scaling. Then we
can assume without loss of generality that all weights are at least equal to 1. Indeed,
if w∗< 1 is the minimum weight, one can consider ℓ′
e(x) = w∗ℓ(w∗x) in place of ℓ(x)
as latency function of resource e, and weight w′
i = wi
w∗≥1 in place of weight wi for
each i ∈N, so that the new game is isomorphic to the initial one, and the social value
of each strategy proﬁle is invariant with respect to the considered transformation.
To establish an upper bound on the worst-case performance guarantee of a so-
lution concept SC with respect to a social function SF in a class of games G ∈
{W(P(d)),U(P(d))}, we use the primal-dual method. Similarly as in Chapter 3, we
ﬁx a game CG ∈G, a social optimum σσσ∗and a strategy proﬁle σσσ ∈SC(CG,δ), and
we construct a linear program LP(SF,σσσ,σσσ∗,δ), whose optimal value is an upper
bound on the efﬁciency of the considered tax function δ:
max
SF(σσσ)
s.t.
constraints(σσσ,σσσ∗)
SF(σσσ∗) = 1
αe ≥0
∀e ∈E,
and the variables are the linear multipliers αe,hs of the resource latencies (as ℓe(x) =
∑d
h=0 αe,hxh).
Now, we determine the inequalities which are used in the following sections, in
place of constraints(σσσ,σσσ∗), to obtain upper bounds on the efﬁciency of dynamic
taxes. We separately consider the cases of ε-approximate pure Nash equilibria and
ε-approximate one-round walks.

that each δh(a,b,c,t) is non-decreasing in t ≥0, for any ﬁxed choice of a,b,c ≥0.
Let σσσ be an ε-approximate pure Nash equilibrium for (CG,δ) and let σσσ∗be a social

9.2 Refundable Taxes for Atomic Games
9.2.1 Taxes for Nash Equilibria
As a ﬁrst result, we show how to deﬁne an efﬁcient dynamic tax function based on
a social optimum with respect to ε-approximate pure Nash equilibria for weighted
games.
Remark 9.2. In Remark 4.1, we have pointed out that, as consequence of the results
of Roughgarden [158] and Bil`o [42], the efﬁciency of pure Nash equilibria is as high
as that of its generalizations (from mixed to coarse-correlated equilibria). The same

9.2 Refundable Taxes for Atomic Games
121
fact holds even under the type of taxes we adopt, despite we will simply refer to the
restricted case of pure Nash equilibria.
Theorem 9.1. Fix an integer d ≥1. For any CG ∈W(P(d)), there exists δ ∈
TAXOPT(W(P(d))) such that δ is a Bd+1(1 + ε)-efﬁcient refundable tax with re-
spect to ε-approximate pure Nash equilibria and to both the total latency and the
weighted total latency.
Proof. For an integer d ≥1, ﬁx a weighted congestion game CG ∈W(P(d)) and let
σσσ∗be a social optimum for CG with respect to the social function SF. Throughout
this proof, we set q∗
e = n∗
e for SF = TL and q∗
e = oe for SF = WTL. Similarly, for
a given strategy proﬁle σσσ, we set qe = ne for SF = TL and qe = ke for SF = WTL.
Consider a dynamic tax function δ ∈TAXOPT(W(P(d))) based on σσσ∗such that
δh(w,oe,n∗
e,ke) := wδh(oe,n∗
e,ke) for SF = TL and δh(w,oe,n∗
e,ke) := δh(oe,n∗
e,ke)
for SF = WTL, where
δh(oe,n∗
e,ke) :=
h
∑
i=1
δh,i(oe,n∗

with
δh,i(oe,n∗
e,ke) :=
i
∑
j=1
S(i, j)(1+ε)jq∗
eoi−1
e
(ke + joe)h−i.
Note that δh(oe,n∗
e,ke) is a polynomial function in ke with non-negative coefﬁcients,
therefore it is non-negative and non-decreasing in ke so that we can use the in-
equalities developed in Section 9.1. Now let σσσ be an ε-approximate pure Nash
equilibrium for (CG,δ). By applying the primal-dual method deﬁned in Chapter 3,
we get the linear program LP := LP(SF,σσσ,σσσ∗,δ) described in Section 9.1, with
constraints(σσσ,σσσ∗) equal to inequality (9.2) for SF = TL and to inequality (9.3) for
SF = WTL.
The related dual program DLP is the following one (we associate the dual vari-
ables x and γ with the ﬁrst and second constraint of LP, respectively):

Now we show that, for each e ∈E and h ∈[d]0, the dual constraint obtained by
setting x = 1 and γ = Bd+1(1+ε) is always satisﬁed by the proposed tax function
δ. To this aim, we exploit the following result.

(9.7)
Proof (of the lemma). To show the claim of Lemma 9.1, one can observe that
the considered tax function δh has been deﬁned in such a way that the left-hand
part of (9.7) is constant with respect to ke. In particular, deﬁne Th,i(oe,n∗
e,ke) :=
∑h

Th,i(oe,n∗

⊓⊔
The upper bound given in Theorem 9.1 is only an existential result, since we
do not know how to compute in polynomial time the social optimum of a given
weighted congestion game with polynomial latencies. We now show that, if we re-
strict to unweighted games, efﬁcient taxes asymptotically matching the lower bound
given in Theorem 9.3 can be computed in polynomial time by solving a convex op-
timization problem.
Theorem 9.2. Fix an integer d ≥1 and an arbitrarily small value ξ > 0. For any
CG ∈U(P(d)), it is possible to compute in polynomial time a tax function δ ∈
TAXMSP(U(P(d))) such that δ is a (1 + ξ)Bd+1(1 + ε)-efﬁcient refundable tax
with respect to ε-approximate pure Nash equilibria and to the total latency.
Proof. Fix an integer d ≥1, an arbitrarily small value ξ > 0 and an unweighted
congestion game CG ∈U(P(d)).
Consider a dynamic tax function δ ∈TAXMSP(U(P(d))) based on a mixed strat-
egy proﬁle yyy ∈∆∆∆such that

⊓⊔
Now, we exhibit a matching lower bound holding for dynamic tax functions
based on a social optimum.
Theorem 9.3. Fix an integer d ≥1. For any ﬁxed ξ > 0, there exists CG ∈U(P(d))
such that, for any δ ∈TAXOPT(U(P(d))), δ is not a (Bd+1(1+ε)−ξ)-efﬁcient
refundable tax for CG with respect to ε-approximate pure Nash equilibria and to
the total latency.
Proof. Fix an integer d ≥1, a dynamic tax functions δ ∈TAXOPT(U(P(d)))
and a value ξ > 0. Game CG has n + 1 players and a set of resources E such
that E = {E0,E1,...,En} with Ej = {e j,1,...,ej,n} for each j ∈[n]0, that is, E
is partitioned into n + 1 groups each of which contains n resources. All the re-
sources in the same group Ej have the same latency function ℓj(x) = αjxd where
αj = (1+ε)j

with Sn+1,1 = En. The lower bound instance for n = 6 is depicted in Figure 9.1.

Fig. 9.1 The lower bound instance of Theorem 9.3 for n = 6. On the abscissa we have the resources
(organized in groups E0,E1,...,En), and on the ordinate we have the players. For any player i ∈
[7]1, the squares containing circles and having position i on the ordinate represent the resources
belonging to strategy Si,1, and the set of black squares having position i represent the resources
belonging to Si,2.
First, we show that the unique social optimum with respect to the total la-
tency is given by the strategy proﬁle σσσ∗:= (S1,2,S2,2,...,Sn,2,Sn+1,1). To this
aim, observe that ci(σσσ∗) = ∑n−1
j=0 αj for each i ∈[n] which implies TL(σσσ∗) =
n∑n−1
j=0 αj + nαn. Consider now any other strategy proﬁle σσσ′ ̸= σσσ∗and note that
in σσσ′ there always exists at least a resource e such that ke > 1. This implies
that TL(σσσ′) > ∑i∈[n+1] ∑e∈σ′
i ℓe(1). By ∑e∈σ′
i ℓe(1) = min{∑n−1
j=0 α j,∑n−1
j=1 jαj +(n−
1)αn} = ∑n−1
j=0 αj, it follows that TL(σσσ∗) < TL(σσσ′).
Consider now the strategy proﬁle σσσ = (S1,1,S2,1,...,Sn,1,Sn+1,1). For each i ∈
[n], we have
bci(σσσ) =
n−1

j=1

whereas
bci(σσσ−i,Si,2) =

αj(( j +1)d +δd(1, j +1)).
Hence, it follows that σσσ is an ε-approximate pure Nash equilibrium for CG. Let us
now evaluate the ratio TL(σσσ)/TL(σσσ∗) to obtain a lower bound on the efﬁciency
of δ. By the fact that ci(σσσ) = ∑n
j=1 jαj jd and ci(σσσ∗) = ∑n−1
j=0 αj for each i ∈[n],
cn+1(σσσ) = nd+1αn and cn(σσσ∗) = nαn, we get

9.2.2 Taxes for One-Round Walks
We now move our attention to the determination of efﬁcient tax functions with re-
spect to ε-approximate one-round walks starting from the empty state.
Theorem 9.4. Fix an integer d ≥1. For any CG ∈U(P(d)), there exists δ ∈
TAXOPT(U(P(d))) such that δ is a Ed+1(1 + ε)-efﬁcient refundable tax with re-
spect to ε-approximate one-round walks starting from the empty state and to the
total latency. Moreover, for any ξ > 0, it is possible to compute in polynomial time
a tax function δ ∈TAXMSP(U(P(d))) such that δ is a (1+ξ)Ed+1(1+ε)-efﬁcient
refundable tax with respect to ε-approximate one-round walks starting from the
empty state and to the total latency.
Proof. For an integer d ≥1, ﬁx an unweighted congestion game CG ∈U(P(d)) and
let σσσ∗be a social optimum for CG with respect to the social function WTL. Consider
a dynamic tax function δ ∈TAXOPT(U(P(d))) based on σσσ∗such that
δh(oe,ke) :=
h

i=0

First of all, we show that δh(oe,ke) ≥0 for each pair of integers (oe,ke) such that
oe ≥0 and ke ≥1 and that δh(oe,ke) is non-decreasing in ke ≥1, so that δ is indeed
a tax function and the inequalities derived in Section 9.1 can be applied. We get
δh(oe,ke) =

are non-
negative and non-decreasing in ke ≥1, the claim holds.
Now let σσσ be the strategy proﬁle generated by an ε-approximate one-round walk
starting from the empty state for (CG,δ). By applying the primal-dual method,
we get the linear program LP := LP(TL,σσσ,σσσ∗,δ) described in Section 9.1, with
constraints(σσσ,σσσ∗) equal to inequality (9.6) where we set yyy = σσσ∗so that E[ke(yyy)] =
oe.
The related dual program DLP is the following one (we associate the dual vari-

Now we show that, for each e ∈E and h ∈[d]0, the dual constraint obtained by
setting x = 1 and γ = Ed+1(1 + ε) is always satisﬁed by the proposed tax function
δ. To this aim, we exploit the following result, that is similar to Lemma 9.1.

is constant with respect to ke, so that its value does
not change if we set ke = 0. The last equality comes from the properties of the

e
Eh+1(1+ε)
and Eh+1(1 + ε) ≤Ed+1(1 + ε) for each h ∈[d]0, we have that the dual constraint
of DLP is satisﬁed. Thus the considered tax function is Ed+1(1+ε)-efﬁcient.
By exploiting the same arguments used in the proof of Theorem 9.2, one can
easily obtain that the tax δ ∈TAXMSP(U(P(d))) based on a mixed strategy proﬁle

⊓⊔
We now exhibit a matching lower bound holding for dynamic tax functions based
on a social optimum.
Theorem 9.5. Fix an integer d ≥1. For any ﬁxed ξ > 0, there exists CG ∈U(P(d))
such that for any δ ∈TAXOPT(W(P(d))), δ is not a (Ed+1(1+ε)−ξ)-efﬁcient
refundable tax for CG with respect to ε-approximate one-round walks starting from
the empty state and to the total latency.
Proof. Fix an integer d ≥1, a dynamic tax functions δ ∈TAXOPT(W(P(d))) and a
value ξ > 0. Game CG has n players and a set of n resources E = {e1,...,en}. The
latency function of resource j is ℓj(x) = α jxd with αj =

Σi = {Si,1,Si,2} with Si,1 := Sn
j=i+1{e j} and Si,2 := {ei} so that player n has one
strategy only.

First, we show that the unique social optimum with respect to the total latency
is given by the strategy proﬁle σσσ∗:= (S1,2,S2,2,...,Sn,2). To this aim consider a
strategy proﬁle σσσ ̸= σσσ∗and let i be the ﬁrst player choosing her ﬁrst strategy. Let us
evaluate the difference TL(σσσ)−TL(σσσ−i,Si,2). We distinguish between two cases. If
σi+1 = Si+1,2, we get TL(σσσ)−TL(σσσ−i,Si,2) ≥3αi+1 −αi > 0. If otherwise, σi+1 =
Si+1,1 then we have i+1 < n so that TL(σσσ)−TL(σσσ−i,Si,2) ≥αi+1+3αi+2−αi > 0.
Hence, the unique social optimum is σσσ∗.
Consider now the strategy proﬁle σσσ = (S1,1,S2,1,...,Sn−1,1,Sn,2). We show that
there exists an ε-approximate one-round walk starting from the empty state τττ =
(σσσ0,σσσ1,...,σσσn) such that σσσ is the strategy proﬁle generated by τττ. For a generic
player i ∈N \{n}, we have

For weighted congestion games, we can prove the following result.

Theorem 9.6. Fix an integer d ≥1. For any CG ∈W(P(d)), there exists δ ∈
TAXOPT(W(P(d))) such that δ is a Zd+1(1 + ε)-efﬁcient refundable tax with re-
spect to ε-approximate one-round walks starting from the empty state and to the
weighted total latency.
Proof. For an integer d ≥1, ﬁx a weighted congestion game CG ∈W(P(d)) and let
σσσ∗be a social optimum for CG with respect to the social function WTL. Consider a
dynamic tax function δ ∈TAXOPT(W(P(d))) based on σσσ∗such that
δh(w,oe,ke) := δh(oe,ke) :=

First of all, we show that δh(oe,ke) ≥0 for each pair of integers (oe,ke) such that
oe ≥0 and ke ≥1 and that δh(oe,ke) is non-decreasing in ke, so that δ is indeed a
tax function and the inequalities derived in Section 9.1 can be applied. We get

e and ∑h
i=1(h+1)i+1((1+ε)oe)i(ke +ioe)h−i are polyno-

Now let σσσ be the strategy proﬁle generated by an ε-approximate one-round walk
starting from the empty state for (CG,δ). By applying the primal-dual method, we
get the linear program LP := LP(WTL,σσσ,σσσ∗,δ) with constraints(σσσ,σσσ∗) equal to
inequality (9.5) (see Section 9.1). The related dual program DLP is the following

9.3 Refundable Taxes for Non-atomic One-Round Walks
Recall deﬁnitions and notations on non-atomic one-round walks given in Chapter 7.
In the following theorem, we prove that, by resorting to refundable dynamic taxes,
the ε-competitive ratio in non-atomic congestion games with polynomial latency
functions can be consistently lowered.
Theorem 9.7. Fix an integer d ≥1. For any non-atomic congestion game NCG ∈
N(P(d)), there exists δ ∈TAXOPT(N(P(d))) such that δ is a (1 + ε)d+1(d + 1)!-
efﬁcient refundable tax with respect to ε-approximate non-atomic one-round walks
starting from the empty state.
Proof. For an integer d ≥1, ﬁx a non-atomic congestion game NCG ∈N(P(d)),
and consider the corresponding game (NCG,δ) with taxes, where δ is a dynamic
tax-function deﬁned as follows:

Let τττ = [(σσσt)t∈[0,R],H] be an arbitrary ε-one-round walk of NCG, and let σσσ and σσσ∗
be the strategy proﬁle generated by τττ and the optimal one, respectively; let ke and
oe denote ke(σσσ) and ke(σσσ∗), respectively. As done in the proof of Theorem 7.1, by
applying the primal-dual method, by relaxing/summing/integrating the constraints
modeling ε-best-responses (which take into account taxation in this case, so that the
latency functions perceived by each player are increased by δe), and by considering
the related dual program, we get the following fact: given γ,x ≥0 such that

and γ := (1 + ε)d+1(d + 1)!. To show this fact, it sufﬁces to prove the following

where equality (9.20) comes from (9.19).
⊓⊔
Remark 9.3. Observe that the problem of ﬁnding an optimal strategy proﬁle requires
to solve a convex minimization problem with linear constraints and a polynomial
objective function. This problem can be approximately solved in polynomial time
by resorting to interior-point methods (see Boyd and Vandenberghe [43]). Therefore,
for each ξ > 0, one can compute in polynomial time a strategy proﬁle whose social
value is at most 1 + ξ times the social optimum. Then, if ˜oe is the congestion of
resource e in that strategy proﬁle, by using the tax function deﬁned in (9.17) with ˜oe
in place of oe, one can easily prove that the resulting ε-competitive ratio is at most
(1+ξ) times that of Theorem 9.7.
9.4 Static versus Dynamic Taxes
Together with the dynamic taxes considered above, we can design efﬁcient static
tax functions based on optimal strategy proﬁles, for the case of polynomial la-
tencies. Such taxes can be deﬁned as δe(ke) := ∑h∈[d]0 αh,e · δ(oe), where oe, as
usual, denotes the optimal congestion of resource e. By exploiting similar argu-
ments as in Chapter 4, we can guarantee the existence of (1 + ε)φ d
ε,d+1-efﬁcient
static taxes based on optimal strategy proﬁles in weighted (resp. weighted, resp.
non-atomic) congestion games with polynomial latency functions of maximum de-
gree d, where φε,d+1 is the unique positive solution k of equation g(k) := −kd+1 +
k +(1+ε)((k +1)d −1) = 0 (resp. g(k) := −kd+1
d+1 +k +(1+ε)((k +1)d −1) = 0,
resp. k := (1+ε)(d +1)) with respect to ε-approximate pure Nash equilibria (resp.
ε-approximate one-round walks, resp. ε-approximate non-atomic one round walks).
For unweighted games, we have obtained static tax functions based on optimal strat-
egy proﬁles (with respect to both ε-approximate pure Nash equilibria or one-round
walks) whose efﬁciency is as high as that in weighted games if φε,d+1 is integer,
and is equal to h(⌊φε,d+1⌋), where h(k) = k f(k) + xg(k) and x ≥0 is such that
h(⌊φε,d+1⌋) = h(⌊φε,d+1 +1⌋).
Furthermore, by exploiting similar techniques as in Chapter 4 to construct tight
lower bounds, one can show that the obtained efﬁciency is the best possible under
static taxes based on optimal strategy proﬁles. This fact reveals that static taxes
based on optimal strategy proﬁles are better than the case without taxes, but worse
than dynamic taxes. In Figure 9.2, we show some numerical comparison for the case
of pure Nash equilibria in unweighted congestion games.

different settings: without taxes, with static taxes and general dynamic taxes based on optimal

9.5 Non-Refundable Taxes
In this section, we give a brief overview of the results obtained for non-refundable
taxes. By exploiting similar arguments to those used for refundable taxes, one can
show how to deﬁne efﬁcient dynamic tax functions based on a social optimum with
respect to both ε-approximate pure Nash equilibria and ε-approximate one-round
walks starting from the empty state.
Theorem 9.8. Fix an integer d ≥1. For any CG ∈W(P(d)), there exists δ ∈
TAXOPT(W(P(d))) such that δ is a

non-refundable tax with respect to ε-approximate pure Nash equilibria and to the
total latency.
Theorem 9.9. Fix an integer d ≥1. For any CG ∈W(P(d)), there exists δ ∈
TAXOPT(W(P(d))) such that δ is a Qd+1(1 + ε)-efﬁcient non-refundable tax with
respect to ε-approximate one-round walks starting from the empty state and to the
weighted total latency.
The proofs of the above theorems are quite technical and have been omitted. To
show the above theorems, as in the refundable case, we start from a linear program
LP(SF,σσσ,σσσ∗) as that deﬁned in Section 9.1, but with SF ∈{TC,WTC} and new
primal constraints, and then we construct the dual in variables (x,γ) whose objective
function is equal to γ. Finally, the taxes are determined in such a way that the feasible
value γ is the lowest possible.

9.6 Concluding Remarks and Related Work
The content of this chapter is based on the work of Bil`o and Vinci [27], that gen-
eralizes the work of Caragiannis et al. [52] from afﬁne to polynomial latency func-
tions, and considers other solution concepts (e.g., approximate equilibria and one-
round walks). Among the obtained results, Caragiannis et al. [52] provides a 2-upper
bound for refundable taxes with respect to mixed Nash equilibria and to both the to-
tal latency and the weighted total latency, and also obtains a 4-upper bound for non-
refundable taxes with respect to mixed Nash equilibria and to the total latency. We
observe that such upper bounds can be reobtained as a special case of our bounds
by setting ε = 0 and d = 1. In these cases, our taxes are indeed static ones.
For further related works, the interested reader can refer to the concluding sec-
tions of Chapters 8 and 10.

Chapter 10
Dynamic Taxes for Unweighted Congestion
Games: from Polynomial to General Latencies
In this chapter, we focus on the problem of deﬁning refundable dynamic taxes for
unweighted congestion games with general latency functions, thus generalizing part
of Chapter 9 (in which we have focused on the speciﬁc case of polynomial latency
functions), and we give an almost complete characterization of the efﬁciency of
taxation in unweighted congestion games, as done by Pigou [150] and Beckmann
et al. [17] for non-atomic congestion games.
Under mild assumptions on the considered latency functions, we explicitly deﬁne
and analyze efﬁcient refundable dynamic taxes for unweighted congestion games
with general latency functions, and with respect to both the ε-approximate price of
anarchy and the competitive ratio of ε-approximate one-round walks. Furthermore,
we show that, under mild assumptions on the considered classes of taxes, the efﬁ-
ciency of our taxes is the best possible, even for load balancing games, and for load
balancing games with identical resources if ε = 0.
Similar results are given for non-atomic congestion games too, where efﬁcient
taxes have been designed with the aim of reducing the competitive ratio of ε-
approximate non-atomic one-round walks.
10.1 Refundable Taxes for Unweighted Games and Pure Nash
Equilibria
In this section, we show how to deﬁne an efﬁcient dynamic tax function based on a
social optimum with respect to ε-approximate pure Nash equilibria for unweighted
games with strictly semi-convex latency functions. Before providing the main re-
sults, we ﬁrst show a preliminary lemma based on the application of the primal-dual
method.
Lemma 10.1. Let G be a class of unweighted congestion games, CG ∈G be a ﬁxed
congestion game, and δ ∈TAXOPT(G) be a refundable tax for CG deﬁned as
δe(k) := δ(ke,oe,ℓe), where oe and ℓe denote the optimal congestion and the latency

function of the considered resource e, respectively. We have that δ is γ∗-efﬁcient for
CG if δ(k,o, f) is non-decreasing in k for any ﬁxed o, f, and the following inequal-
ities are satisﬁed for any k,o ∈Z≥0 and f ∈C(G):
γ∗o f(o) ≥−kδ(k,o, f)+(1+ε)of(k +1)+(1+ε)oδ(k +1,o, f).
(10.1)
Proof. Let σσσ and σσσ∗be an ε-approximate equilibrium in game (CG,δ) and an op-
timal strategy proﬁle of CG, respectively. By applying the primal-dual method, and
by using similar arguments as in Section 9.1 (for the use of taxes) and Chapter 4 (to
cope with general latency functions), we have that the optimal value of the follow-
ing linear program LP in the variables αes is an upper bound on the efﬁciency of tax
function δ with respect to ε-approximate pure Nash equilibria:

∀e ∈E,
where (10.2) is a relaxed Nash equilibrium condition coming from the fact that
δ(k,o, f) is non-decreasing in k. The dual program DLP (in dual variables x,γ) is
the following:
DLP :

+x[(1+ε)oe (ℓe(ke +1)+δ(ke +1,oe,ℓe))], ∀e ∈E
(10.3)
x ≥0.
Any feasible solution γ, by the Weak Duality Theorem, is an upper bound on the
efﬁciency of tax function δ. After setting x = 1 in (10.3), we get the following
equivalent set of constraints in variable γ:
γoeℓe(oe) ≥−keδ(ke,oe,ℓe)+(1+ε)oe(ℓe(ke +1)+δe(ke +1,oe,ℓe)), ∀e ∈E.
(10.4)
By exploiting (10.1), we have that (10.4) is feasible if we set γ := γ∗, and this shows
the claim.

BG(1+ε) :=
sup
f∈C(G),o∈N
B f (1+ε,o).
(10.6)
By applying Lemma 10.1, one can show the following theorem.
Theorem 10.1. Let G be a class of unweighted games whose non-constant latency
functions are strictly semi-convex. Given CG ∈G, there exists a BG(1+ε)-efﬁcient
refundable tax function δ ∈TAXOPT(G) for CG, with respect to ε-approximate pure
Nash equilibria and to the total latency.
Proof (Sketch). For any ﬁxed non-constant latency f ∈C(G) and o ∈N, let δ(k,o, f)
be the tax function inductively deﬁned as follows: (i) we set δ(k,o, f) := 0 for k := 0;
(ii) we impose that (10.1) holds as equality for the considered o, f and γ∗equal to
γ∗
o, f := B f (1+ε,o), so that we can iteratively deﬁne δ(k,o, f) for any k > 0. If f is
constant or o = 0, we set δ(k,o, f) := 0 for any k.
If f is constant or o = 0, we have that (10.1) is trivially veriﬁed if γ∗= 1, and
then it is also satisﬁed by γ∗:= BG(1+ε) ≥1. Now, assume that f is non-constant
and o > 0. By the hypothesis, we necessarily have that f is strictly semi-convex. By
explicating the recurrence relation to compute δ(k,o, f) and by exploiting the def-
inition of B f (1+ε,o), one can show that δ(k,o, f) is non-negative for any integer
k ≥0. By using the strict semi-convexity of f and the fact that (10.1) is satisﬁed
as equality by δ(k,o, f) for any ﬁxed o if γ∗= γ∗
o, f , one can show that δ(k,o, f)
is necessarily non-decreasing in k. Thus, by setting γ∗:= BG(1 + ε) in (10.1) and
by exploiting the above properties of tax function δ(k,o, f), we have that the set of
constraints (10.1) is satisﬁed if f is non-constant and o > 0 (since BG(1+ε) ≥γ∗
o, f
in this case).
We conclude that our tax function satisﬁes the hypothesis of Lemma 10.1, and
this shows the claim.
⊓⊔
Remark 10.1. As (non-constant) polynomial latency functions are strictly semi-
convex, we can apply Theorem 10.1 to reobtain automatically the claim of Theo-
rem 9.1, for the restricted case of unweighted games.
Remark 10.2. By exploiting the convexity of the latency functions, the arguments
of Theorem 9.2 on how to compute efﬁcient taxes in polynomial time can be easily
extended to more general latency functions. In particular, one can show that, for any
ξ > 0, (BG(1 + ε) + ξ)-efﬁcient taxes can be computed by solving a convex opti-
mization problem, whose (1+ξ)-approximate optimum can be found in polynomial
time under mild assumptions on the latency functions.
Now, we exhibit a matching lower bound holding for dynamic tax functions based
on a social optimum and with strictly semi-convex latency functions, which be-
comes a corollary of the following theorem.
Theorem 10.2. Let G be a class of unweighted congestion games whose non-
constant latency functions are closed under ordinate scaling and are strictly semi-
convex. For any ﬁxed M < BG(1 + ε), there exists CG ∈G such that, for any

140
10 Dynamic Taxes for Unweighted Congestion Games
δ ∈TAXOPT(G), δ is not an M-efﬁcient refundable tax for CG with respect to ε-
approximate pure Nash equilibria and to the total latency. Furthermore, the con-
sidered lower bound holds even for load balancing games1, and for load balancing
games with identical resources if ε = 0.
Proof (Sketch). Let f ∈C(G) and o ∈N be such that B f (1 + ε,o) > M, and ﬁx an
arbitrary integer n > o. Similarly as in Theorems 4.2 and 4.3, we deﬁne the lower
bounding instance by resorting to a load balancing (multi-)graph: the nodes are the
resources, and each copy of an edge (u,v) corresponds to a player who can play
resources u,v only, denoted, respectively, as the ﬁrst and the second strategy of the
player.
Consider a load balancing graph LB(n,o) organized in n + 1 levels numbered
from 0 to n and deﬁned as follows. For each j ∈[n], there are on−j(n−o)(n−1)j−1
nodes/resources at level j, and there are on nodes/resources at level 0. There are o
self-loop edges on each resource at level 0 (corresponding to dummy players with
a unique strategy), and non-self loop edges can only connect nodes of consecutive
levels, so that, for each i ∈[n]0, there are directed edges from level i to level i + 1.
The out-degree (including self-loop edges) of each node at level j ∈[n]0 is n−j and
the in-degree (including self-loop edges) of each node at level j ∈[n]0 is o. Each
resource at level j has latency function gj(x) = f(x)/(1 + ε)j. We observe that a
load balancing graph satisfying the above properties can be realized.
Let σσσ and σσσ∗be the strategy proﬁles in which all players play their ﬁrst and their
second strategy, respectively. Observe that ke(σσσ∗) = o for any e ∈E and ke(σσσ) =
n−j for any resource at level j ∈[n]0. See Figure 10.1 for a clarifying example on
the considered load-balancing graph.

the corresponding resources on the left.
1 As usual, the hypothesis of ordinate-scaling latencies is not necessary to provide lower bounds
for general congestion games. However, in this case, it is necessary to show that the lower bound
holds for general load balancing games.

10.1 Refundable Taxes for Unweighted Games and Pure Nash Equilibria
141
By using the fact that latencies are strictly semi-convex, one can show the fol-
lowing lemma.
Lemma 10.2. For any optimal strategy proﬁle σσσ′ of LB, we get ke(σσσ′) = o.
Because of Lemma 10.2, we can consider (without loss of generality) dynamic taxes
based on strategy proﬁle σσσ∗only.
Now, we show that σσσ is an ε-approximate pure Nash equilibrium, for any tax
function δ based on the social optimum σσσ∗, that is unique up to strategy proﬁles
having the same congestion on each resource (by Lemma 10.2)2. Since the con-
sidered tax function is based on the social optimum, we have that δe is deﬁned as
δe(k) := ˆδ(k,o, f)/(1+ε)j for any resource e at level j, where ˆδ is a function that
only depends on the congestion k of the resource e (with respect to the considered
strategy proﬁle), the optimal congestion o = ke(σσσ∗) and the function f. For any
non-self-loop player i, we get:
ˆci(σσσ) = f(kσi(σσσ))+ ˆδ(kσi(σσσ),o, f)
(1+ε)j
= f(n−j)+ ˆδ(n−j,o, f)

thus σσσ is an ε-approximate pure Nash equilibrium. We get

We conclude that, for a sufﬁciently large n, any refundable tax function based on
the social optimum is not M-efﬁcient for LB(n,o), and this shows the claim.
⊓⊔
2 In this case, one can also prove that σσσ∗is the unique strategy proﬁle such that all the congestions
are equal to o, but it is not necessary for our aims.

10 Dynamic Taxes for Unweighted Congestion Games
Remark 10.3. Similarly to the approach considered in Chapter 4, the lower bound of
Theorem 10.2 can be derived by exploiting a modiﬁed linear program LP obtained
from the dual program DLP in the proof of Lemma 10.1, after transforming the
taxes in further dual variables. In particular, by setting yk,o, f := x(δ(k,o, f)+ f(k))
in DLP, and assuming without loss of generality that the set of congestions of type
ke and oe appearing in (10.3) is the whole set [n]0, we get the following dual program
in variables γ and (yk,o, f )k∈[n+1]0,o∈[n]0 f∈C(CG):
DLP :
min
γ
s.t.
γof(o) ≥k f(k)−kyk,o, f +(1+ε)oyk+1,o, f , ∀k,o ∈[n]0, f ∈C(CG) (10.7)
yk,o, f ≥0, ∀k ∈[n+1]0,o ∈[n]0, f ∈C(CG).
Analogously to the proof of Theorem 10.1, the optimum of DLP is achieved
when the dual constraints (10.7) are tight for some o ∈[n] and f ∈C(CG), and
if y0,o, f = yn+1,o, f = 0. In particular, there are some o ∈[n] and f ∈C(CG) such
that the following dual program in variables γ and (yk)k∈[n], with yk := yk,o, f , is
equivalent to DLP:
DLP2 :
min
γ
s.t.
γo f(o) = k f(k)−kyk +(1+ε)oyk+1,
∀k ∈[n]0
yk ≥0, ∀k ∈[n]0,
where y0 and yn+1 are set equal to 0, and then are not considered as variables. The
dual program of DLP2 is a linear program in variables (αk)k∈[n]0 deﬁned as follows:
LP :
max
∑
k∈[n]0
αkk f(k)
s.t.
αkk ≤αk−1(1+ε)o,
∀k ∈[n]
(10.8)
∑
k∈[n]0
αko f(o) = 1
αk ≥0,
∀k ∈[n]0.
One can show that the optimum of DLP2 is guaranteed when all the dual variables of
DLP2 (but y0 and yn+1) are strictly positive. Thus, by the complementary slackness
conditions, we have that all the constrains in (10.8) are tight.
The tight constraints of type αkk = αk−1(1+ε)o suggest how to construct a load
balancing instance serving as tight lower bound:
(i) the resources are organized in levels 0,1,...,n, and each player is associated with
a type k ∈[n];
(ii) each player of type k can select among a resource at level n −k and a resource
at level n−k +1, that we call respectively ﬁrst and second strategy of the con-

10.2 Refundable Taxes for One-Round Walks
143
sidered player; furthermore, let σσσ and σσσ∗denote the strategy proﬁles in which
all players select their ﬁrst and second strategy, respectively;
(iii) for any k ∈[n], the total cost of the players selecting a resource at level n −k
in σσσ is equal to αkk f(k)ck for some constant ck > 0, and the sum of all their
costs coming from unilateral deviations in favor of the second strategy (i.e., a
sum of costs of type ci(σσσ−i,σ∗
i )) is αk−1of(k)ck, and we have that αkk f(k)ck =
(1+ε)αk−1o f(k)ck because of the tight constraints.
In particular, property (iii) is satisﬁed by the following modeling choices:
(a) given k ∈[n], the number of resources at each level n−k is proportional to αk,
and the number of players selecting each resource at level n−k (resp. n−k+1)
when playing the ﬁrst (resp. second) strategy must be equal to k (resp. o);
(b) the cost of each player of type k selecting her ﬁrst strategy (i.e., a resource
at level n −k) in σσσ is exactly (1 + ε) times the cost she would incur if she
unilaterally deviated in favor of her second strategy (i.e., a resource at level
n−k +1), thus, playing the ﬁrst strategy is a pure Nash equilibrium.
By imposing the above conditions, and by considering some further reﬁnements, one
can obtain a lower bounding instance that is structurally analogue to that considered
in Theorem 10.2.
10.2 Refundable Taxes for One-Round Walks
10.2.1 Unweighted Games
Analogously to Theorem 10.1, we obtain efﬁcient taxes with respect to ε-approximate
one-round walks. We ﬁrst provide a preliminary lemma.
Lemma 10.3. Let G be a class of unweighted congestion games, CG ∈G be a
ﬁxed congestion game, and δ ∈TAXOPT(G) be a refundable tax for CG deﬁned
as δe(ke) := δ(ke,oe, fe), where oe and ℓe denote the optimal congestion and the
latency function of the considered resource e, respectively. We have that δ is γ∗-
efﬁcient for CG if δ(k,o, f) is non-decreasing in k for any ﬁxed o, f, and the follow-
ing inequality is satisﬁed for any k,o ∈Z≥0 and f ∈C(G):

walk in game (CG,δ) (resp. an optimal strategy proﬁle of CG). By applying the

primal-dual method, and by using similar arguments as in Chapter 4 (for approxi-
mate one-round walks and general latency functions) and Lemma 10.1, we have that
the optimal value of the following linear program in variables αes is an upper bound
on the efﬁciency of tax function δ with respect to ε-approximate one round walks:

10.2 Refundable Taxes for One-Round Walks
145
By using similar arguments as in the proof of Theorem 10.2, we can resort to
Lemma 10.3 to show the following theorem.
Theorem 10.3. Let G be a class of unweighted games whose non-constant latency
functions are strictly semi-convex. Given CG ∈G, there exists a EG(1+ε)-efﬁcient
refundable tax function δ ∈TAXOPT(G) for CG, with respect to ε-approximate one-
round walks and to the total latency.
Proof (Sketch). For any ﬁxed non-constant latency f ∈C(G) and o ∈N, let δ(k,o, f)
be the tax function inductively deﬁned as follows: (i) we set δ(k,o, f) := 0 for k := 0;
(ii) we impose that (10.9) holds as equality for the considered o, f and γ∗equal to
γ∗
o, f := E f (1+ε,o), so that we can iteratively deﬁne δ(k,o, f) for any k > 0. If f is
constant or o = 0, we set δ(k,o, f) := 0 for any k.
By proceeding as in the proof of Theorem 10.2, one can show that δ is non-
negative and non-decreasing. Furthermore, one can show that (10.9) is satisﬁed by
δ. We conclude that the hypotheses of Lemma 10.3 are satisﬁed, and then δ is
EG(1+ε)-efﬁcient refundable.
⊓⊔
Remark 10.4. As (non-constant) polynomial latency functions are strictly semi-
convex, we can apply Theorem 10.3 to reobtain automatically the claim of Theo-
rem 9.4.
Remark 10.5. By similar argument as in Remark 10.2, one can show that, for any
ξ > 0, (EG(1 + ε) + ξ)-efﬁcient taxes can be computed by solving a convex opti-
mization problem, whose approximately optimal solution can be found in polyno-
mial time under mild assumptions on the latency functions.
In Theorem 10.4, we exhibit a matching lower bound holding for dynamic tax func-
tions based on a social optimum, thus generalizing Theorem 9.5 (holding for poly-
nomial latencies only), that becomes a corollary of the following theorem.
Theorem 10.4. Let G be a class of unweighted congestion games whose non-
constant latency functions are closed under ordinate scaling and strictly semi-
convex. For any ﬁxed M < EG(1 + ε), there exists CG ∈G such that, for any
δ ∈TAXOPT(G), δ is not an M-efﬁcient refundable tax for CG with respect to ε-
approximate one-round walks and to the total latency. Furthermore, the considered
lower bound holds even for load balancing games, and for load balancing games
with identical resources if ε = 0.
Proof (Sketch). Let f ∈C(G) be a non-constant latency function and o ∈N such that
E f (1+ε,o) > M, and let n > o be an arbitrary integer. We deﬁne the lower bounding
instance by resorting to a load balancing graph, as in Theorem 10.2. Consider a load
balancing graph LB(n,o) recursively deﬁned as follows:
• the nodes/resources are split into different subgroups, and each subgroup is as-
sociated with a type j ∈[n]0 (in general, there are several subgroups associated
with the same type);
• there is a unique subgroup of type n;

146
10 Dynamic Taxes for Unweighted Congestion Games
• for any subgroup of type j ∈[n]0, there are (directed) edges from this group to
j subgroups of type j −1, j −2,...,1,0;
• the subgraph induced by subgroups (i.e. a graph whose nodes are subgroups,
and there is an edge (u,v) between two subgroups if and only if there are edges
going from u to v in the load balancing graph) is a directed tree, whose edges
are oriented from the root to the leaves;
• each resource belonging to a subgroup at depth d in the above directed tree has
latency gd(x) := f(s)/(1+ε)d;
• there are o further self-loops on each resource of type n;
• the out-degree (resp. in-degree) of any resource of subgroups of type j ∈[n]0 is
j (resp. o), excluding (resp. including) the contribution of self-loops; in partic-
ular, each resource of type j ∈[n] has exactly one out-going edge directed to a
resource of type h for any h ∈[j−1]0, and each resource of type h ∈[n−1]0 has
exactly o in-going edges from o distinct resources of type j, for some j ∈[n]h+1.
One can show that a load-balancing graph verifying the above properties exists.

Fig. 10.2 The subgroup structure of the lower bound instance of Theorem 10.4, with n = 4 and
a generic o > 0. In particular, the directed tree depicted in the ﬁgure is the subgraph induced by
subgroups of nodes/resources in LB(4,o). Each block represents a subgroup of resources, and
the number associated with each block represents its type. The numbers on the right denote the
depth of the corresponding subgroups on the left. Each directed edge going from subgroup a to
subgroup b means that there are edges from resources of a to resources of b in the underlying load-
balancing graph. We observe that the type of each subgroup at depth d ≥1 equivalently represents
the congestion in σσσ of the corresponding resources. Instead, the congestion in σσσ of the resources
in the unique subgroup at depth d = 0 is equal to n+o (because of the self-loop players selecting
such resources). Refer to the example represented in Figure 10.3 to see a zoomed part of the load-
balancing graph, and in particular, how the edges connect the resources from different subgroups.
Let σσσ and σσσ∗be the strategy proﬁles in which all players play their ﬁrst and
their second strategy, respectively. By construction, we have that ke(σσσ) = j for any
resource e of type j ∈[n −1]0, ke(σσσ) = n + o for the resources e of type n, and

Fig. 10.3 A more detailed description of a portion of the load balancing graph LB(n,2) (i.e.,
with a generic n and o = 2), made of four nodes/resources from a subgroup of type 3, and their
child nodes/resources from subgroups of type 2,1,0. We observe that, according to the recursive
deﬁnition of LB(n,2), each resource of type 3 has exactly one out-going edge directed to a resource
of type h for any h ∈{0,1,2}, and each resource of type h ∈{0,1,2} has exactly 2 in-going edges
from 2 distinct resources of type 3.
ke(σσσ∗) = o for any resource e ∈E (regardless of the type). See Figures 10.2 and
10.3 for a clarifying example.
Let τττ be the online process deﬁned as follows: (i) all non-self-loop players enter
the game in non-decreasing order with respect to the type of the subgroup which
their second strategy/resource belongs to (ties are broken arbitrarily), but (ii) they
choose their ﬁrst strategy; (iii) ﬁnally, all the self-loop players select the resources
of type n which they are associated with. We observe that σσσ is the strategy proﬁle
generated by τττ.
In the following, we show that τττ is an ε-one-round-walk, regardless of the con-
sidered tax function. By exploiting the strict semi-convexity of the latencies, one
can prove that, for any optimal strategy proﬁle, the congestion of each resource
e ∈E is necessarily equal to o = ke(σσσ∗). Thus, analogously to Theorem 10.2, we
can consider without loss of generality tax functions based on σσσ∗.
Fix a tax function δ ∈TAXOPT(G). Since the considered tax function is based on
the social optimum, we have that δe is deﬁned as δe(k) := ˆδ(k,o, f)/(1+ε)d for any
resource e of a subgroup at depth d, where ˆδ is a function that only depends on the
congestion k of the resource e (with respect to the considered strategy proﬁle), the
optimal congestion o = ke(σσσ∗) and the function f. By construction of τττ, any non-

148
10 Dynamic Taxes for Unweighted Congestion Games
self-loop player i entering the game chooses among two resources u and v having
the same congestion (i.e., ku(σσσi−1) = kv(σσσi−1)). Thus, for any non-self loop player
(u,v) entering the game, the total cost (given by the latency plus the tax) of resource
u is (1+ε) times that of v. We conclude that, for any tax function δ ∈TAXOPT(G),
τττ is an ε-approximate one-round walk in (CG,δ), thus showing that σσσ is the strategy
proﬁle generated by an ε-one-round walk.
Now, to compute the total latency of both σσσ and σσσ∗, we consider, for any h ∈[n]0,
the value Ah := ∑e∈Eh αe, where Eh is the set of resources of type higher or equal
than j := n −h, and αe is set equal to (1 + ε)d if the depth of node/resource e in
LB(n,o) is equal to d. By exploiting the recursive deﬁnition of LB(n,o), one can
show that, for any h ∈[n], (Ah −Ah−1)o(1 + ε) = Ah−1 holds. This equality can
be shown by observing that each resource e ∈Eh \ Eh−1 can be associated, via a
bijective mapping, to o distinct resources e′ in Eh−1 such that (1 + ε)αe = αe′. By
rewriting the above equality, we get
Ah =

⊓⊔
Remark 10.6. Similarly to Remark 10.3, the lower bounding instance provided in
Theorem 10.4 has been suggested by the dual DLP of Lemma 10.3. In particular,
if we transform the taxes of DLP in further dual variables, and then we analyze the
resulting primal-dual pair as in Remark 10.3, we get a set of tight constraints that
helps to design a tight lower bounding instance.
10.2.2 Non-atomic Games
Similarly to Theorem 10.1, we obtain efﬁcient taxes with respect to non-atomic one-
round walks. We ﬁrst provide a preliminary lemma, that can be seen as a non-atomic
version of Lemma 10.3 and follow the proof arguments of Theorem 7.1.
Lemma 10.4. Let G be a class of non-atomic congestion games, NCG ∈G be a ﬁxed
congestion game, and let δ ∈TAXOPT(G) be a refundable tax for NCG deﬁned
as δe(k) := δ(k,o, f), with o and f being the optimal congestion and the latency
function of the considered resource e. We have that δ is γ∗-efﬁcient for NCG if
δ(k,o, f) is non-decreasing in k for any ﬁxed o, f, and the following inequality is
satisﬁed for any k,o ≥0 and f ∈C(G):

10 Dynamic Taxes for Unweighted Congestion Games
Theorem 10.5. Let G be a class of non-atomic games whose non-constant latency
functions are strictly semi-convex. Given NCG ∈G, there exists a NG(1+ε)-efﬁcient
refundable tax function δ ∈TAXOPT(G) for NCG, with respect to ε-approximate
non-atomic one-round walks and to the total latency.
Proof (Sketch). For any ﬁxed non-constant latency f ∈C(G) and o > 0, let δ(k,o, f)
be the tax function deﬁned as follows: (i) δ(k,o, f) := 0 for k := 0; (ii) (10.9) holds
as equality for the considered o, f and γ∗equal to γ∗
o, f := N f (1+ε,o). We observe
that δ(k,o, f) can be computed by solving the following Cauchy problem in a real
function y deﬁned as y(k) :=
R t
0 δ(t,o, f)dt (that is, δ(k,o, f) = ∂

y(0) = 0.
If f is constant or o = 0, we set δ(k,o, f) := 0 for any k.
By proceeding as in the proof of Theorem 10.2, one can show that δ is non-
negative and non-decreasing. Furthermore, one can show that (10.14) is satisﬁed
by δ. We conclude that the hypotheses of Lemma 10.4 are satisﬁed, and then δ is
NG(1+ε)-efﬁcient refundable.
⊓⊔
Remark 10.7. As (non-constant) polynomial latency functions are strictly semi-
convex, we can apply Theorem 10.5 to reobtain automatically the claim of Theo-
rem 9.7.
Remark 10.8. For any given non-atomic congestion game with semi-convex latency
functions, under mild assumptions, we can ﬁnd in polynomial time a (1 + ξ)-
approximate optimal solution for any ﬁxed ξ > 0. Thus, the same arguments of
Theorem 10.5 can be used to derive (NG(1+ε)+ ξ)-efﬁcient taxes based on such
approximate solutions.
In the following theorem, we show that the efﬁciency shown in Theorem 10.5 cannot
be improved, when considering taxes based on optimal strategy proﬁles.
Theorem 10.6. Let G be a class of unweighted congestion games whose laten-
cies are closed under ordinate scaling and strictly semi-convex. For any ﬁxed
M < NG(1 + ε), there exists NCG ∈G such that, for any δ ∈TAXOPT(G), δ is
not an M-efﬁcient refundable tax for CG with respect to ε-approximate one-round
walks and to the total latency. Furthermore, the considered lower bound, holds even
for load balancing games, and for load balancing games with identical resources if
ε = 0.
Proof (Sketch). A tight lower bounding instance can be obtained by exploiting the
proof of Theorem 10.4. Let f ∈C(G) and o > 0 be such that Nf (1+ε,o) > M, and
let k,t > o be sufﬁciently large real numbers. Let LB f (n′,o′) be the lower bounding
instance provided in Theorem 10.4, with n′ := ⌈kt⌉, o′ := ⌈ot⌉, and with players
weights equal to 1/t. Similarly as in Theorem 7.3, if t is sufﬁciently large, the con-
sidered unweighted lower bounding instance can be transformed in a non-atomic
load balancing instance whose competitive ratio, even with the use of taxes, is arbi-
trarily close to N f (1+ε,o) as t and k increase.

10.3 Concluding Remarks and Related Work
151
10.3 Concluding Remarks and Related Work
This chapter is based on some preliminary results included in the second author’s
PhD thesis. In previous works, the use of dynamic taxes to improve the performance
in congestion games with general latency functions has been mainly investigated
for non-atomic games and pure Nash equilibria, and it has been shown that either
universal dynamic taxes (i.e., dynamically dependent on the local congestion of each
resource), or static taxes depending on the social optimum, guarantee that the social
optimum becomes a pure Nash equilibrium (see Beckmann et al. [17], Pigou [150]
for further details). Analogously to non-atomic games and pure Nash equilibria, our
results characterize the best taxation mechanisms based on optimal strategy proﬁles
for atomic games and several solution concepts.
Similar results as those obtained for exact Nash equilibria (i.e., the results of Sec-
tion 10.1 with ε = 0) have been independently achieved by Paccagnan and Gairing
[137]. Regarding exact Nash equilibria, their work constitutes a more complete and
detailed version of the results discussed in this chapter. In particular, Paccagnan and
Gairing [137] show how to compute B f (1,o)-efﬁcient refundable taxes based on the
social optimum, and how to compute them in polynomial time at the expense of an
arbitrarily small efﬁciency loss. Furthermore, they focus on the optimization prob-
lem of ﬁnding social optima in congestion games, and show that the approximation
guaranteed by the above taxes is the best possible, unless P = NP.
The works of Paccagnan et al. [140] and Ravindran Vijayalakshmi and Skopalik
[152] focus on the framework of dynamic universal taxes. In particular, they in-
dependently provide efﬁcient dynamic universal taxes for unweighted games with
general latency functions, and show their optimality via tight lower bounds.

Chapter 11
Stackelberg Strategies for Afﬁne Unweighted
Congestion Games
In Stackelberg games, a central authority, called the leader, is granted the power
of dictating the strategies of a subset of players, called the followers. The leader’s
purpose is to determine a good Stackelberg strategy, which is an algorithm that
carefully chooses a subset of players (called coordinated players) and their assigned
strategies, so as to mitigate as much as possible the effects caused by the selﬁsh
behavior of the uncoordinated players, that is, to lower as much as possible the
price of anarchy of the resulting game. The power of the mechanism is limited by a
parameter α ∈(0,1), that is the maximum fraction of players the leader can control.
Thus, the higher the α, the lower the resulting price of anarchy.
In this chapter, we consider the application of three Stackelberg strategies,
namely Largest Latency First, Cover and Scale, to congestion games with afﬁne
latency functions, and we show upper and lower bounds on their worst-case price of
anarchy. In particular, by resorting to the primal-dual method, we obtain the follow-
ing results: for Largest Latency First, we show that the price of anarchy is exactly
(20 −11α)/8 for α ∈[0,4/7] and (4 −3α +
√
4α −3α2)/2 for α ∈[4/7,1]; for
λ-Cover, we show that the price of anarchy is exactly 4λ−1
3λ−1 for afﬁne latency func-
tions and exactly 1+(4λ +1)/(4λ(2λ +1)) for linear ones; ﬁnally, for Scale, we
give an upper bound of 1+((1−α)(2h+1))/((1−α)h2 +αh+1), where h is the
unique integer such that α ∈[(2h2 −3)/(2(h2 −1)),(2h2 +4h−1)/(2h(h+2))].
11.1 Stackelberg Strategies: Preliminaries
Assume that there is a central authority, which in this setting is usually referred to as
the leader, who has the power of dictating the strategies of a subset of players. The
leader’s purpose is to determine a good Stackelberg strategy, which is an algorithm
that carefully chooses the subset of players (called coordinated players) and their
assigned strategies, so as to mitigate as much as possible the effects caused by the
selﬁsh behavior of the uncoordinated players, that is, to lower as much as possible
the price of anarchy of the resulting game.

11 Stackelberg Strategies for Afﬁne Unweighted Congestion Games
Given a congestion game CG and a Stackelberg strategy A, let PA be the set of
coordinated players chosen by A and Si be the prescribed strategy assigned by A to
each player i ∈PA. The congestion game CGA, obtained from CG by coordinating
the choices of the players in PA, is the same as CG with the only difference that, for
each player i ∈PA, CGA has Σi = {Si}, that is, each coordinated player becomes a
selﬁsh player who has no alternatives except for her prescribed strategy.
A Stackelberg strategy is optimal-restricted if the coordinated players are as-
signed the strategy they adopt in a social optimum σσσ∗. For each optimal-restricted
Stackelberg strategy A, since the optimal value of CGA is equal to that of CG, the
price of anarchy of CGA becomes PoA(CGA) = maxσσσ∈NE(CGA)
SUM(σσσ)
SUM(σσσ∗).
In this chapter, we focus on three optimal-restricted Stackelberg strategies. The
ﬁrst two ones are deterministic, while the latter is randomized, hence, its price of
anarchy will be evaluated in expectation. Moreover, in the ﬁrst and third strategy
the number of coordinated players is assumed to be equal to αn for some α ∈[0,1]
with αn ∈N, i.e., the leader controls a fraction α of the players in the game. For a
ﬁxed congestion game CG and social optimum σσσ∗, they are deﬁned as follows:
• LLF(α): for each α ∈[0,1] such that αn ∈N, the set of coordinated players is
chosen equal to the set of the αn players with the highest cost in σσσ∗, breaking
ties arbitrarily. LLF stands for Largest Latency First.
• λ-Cover: for each λ ∈N \ {0}, the set of coordinated players P is chosen so
as to guarantee that |{i ∈P : j ∈σ∗
i }| ≥min{λ,nj(σσσ∗)} for each j ∈E. Note
that one such a set P might not exist in CG, so that this strategy is not always
applicable.
• Scale(α): for each α ∈[0,1] such that αn ∈N, the set of coordinated players
is randomly chosen with uniform probability among the set of all subsets of N
having cardinality αn.
For a given optimal-restricted Stackelberg strategy A, our aim is to focus on the
characterization of the price of anarchy of game CGA, when CG is an afﬁne con-
gestion game. Let G be any subclass of the class of congestion games. We de-
ﬁne the price of anarchy of Stackelberg strategy A in the class of games G as
PoAG(A) = supCG∈G PoA(CGA). Now let ACG and LCG be the class of afﬁne
congestion games and that of linear congestion games, respectively. Let ℓj(x) :=
ajx + bj (resp. ℓ(x) := ajx) denote the latency of resource j ∈E of an afﬁne (resp.
linear) congestion game. By exploiting a result in [22], it follows that for each afﬁne
congestion game CG, there exists a linear congestion game CG′, deﬁned on a differ-
ent set of resources, with PoA(CG′
A) = PoA(CGA). Hence, it is possible to conclude
that, for any Stackelberg strategy A ∈{LLF(α),Scale(α)},
PoAACG(A) = PoALCG(A).
(11.1)
As a consequence of (11.1), we will be allowed to restrict our attention only to the
class of linear congestion games when bounding the price of anarchy of these two

11.2 Price of Anarchy of Largest Latency First

Stackelberg strategies in the class of afﬁne congestion games.1 Moreover, we will
use the simpliﬁed notation PoA(A) to denote the value PoAACG(A) = PoALCG(A)
when considering A ∈{LLF(α),Scale(α)}. However, we cannot exploit the result
in [22] to prove (11.1) in the case in which A = λ-Cover, thus, in this case, we
consider the cases of afﬁne and linear latency functions separately.
11.2 Price of Anarchy of Largest Latency First
In this section, we provide a tight bound on the price of anarchy of Largest Latency
First. For the characterization of the upper bound, we use the primal-dual method.
To this aim, ﬁx a linear congestion game CG, a social optimum σσσ∗and a pure Nash
equilibrium σσσ induced by LLF(α). Let P be the set of αn coordinated players cho-
sen by LLF(α). For the sake of conciseness, for each j ∈E, we set x j := nj(σσσ),
oj := nj(σσσ∗) and sj := |{i ∈P : j ∈σ∗
i }|. Clearly, we have sj ≤min{xj,oj} for
each j ∈E.
We obtain the following primal linear program LP := LP(σσσ,σσσ∗) deﬁned over the
latency functions of the resources in E:
LP :

where the ﬁrst family of constraints is satisﬁed since each uncoordinated player
cannot lower her cost by switching to the strategy she adopts in σσσ∗and the second
one is satisﬁed because LLF(α) selects the set of |P| = αn players with the highest

The dual program DLP := DLP(σσσ,σσσ∗), obtained by associating the variables
(yi)i∈N\P with the ﬁrst family of constraints, the variables (zik)i∈N\P,k∈P with the
second family of constraints and the variable γ with the last constraint, is the fol-
lowing:
DLP :

1 This equivalence does not apply to λ-Cover, as, since the transformation given in [22] changes
the set of resources, a choice inducing a λ-Cover for game CG might not guarantee a λ-Cover for
game CG′.

Any feasible solution for DLP which is independent of the choices of σσσ and σσσ∗, i.e.,
satisfying the dual constraint for each possible pair of integers (xj,oj) ∈{N ∪{0}}2,
will provide an upper bound on PoA(CGLLF(α)) which, by the generality of CG,
gives an upper bound on PoA(LLF(α)). We get the following result.

This is a linear function on xj which is negative for x j = 0, hence f(xj,oj,sj) is

δsj (o j,sj) = 4(α + θ) −2(3α + 3θ −2)oj.
Since α +θ −1 ≥0 for each α ∈[4/7,1], this function is non-increasing for oj ≥2,
so that g(o j,sj) is minimized for sj = oj when o j ≥2. By substituting, we get
g(oj,oj) ≥0 as desired. For the leftover cases of oj ≤1, we have f(xj,0,0) =
2αx2
j ≥0 and f(xj,1,sj) = 2αx2
j −2(α + θ)xj + (2 −α −θ)sj + 2θ. Since 2 −
α −θ ≤0 for each α ∈[4/7,1], we have that this last function is minimized for
sj = 0. Hence, we need to show that f(xj,1,0) = 2αx2
j −2(α +θ)xj +2θ ≥0. By
solving for xj, we get f(xj,1,0) ≥0 when xj ≤1 or xj ≥θ/α. Since, θ/α ≤2 for
each α ∈[4/7,1], f(xj,1,0) ≥0 for each non-negative integer xj and the proof is
complete.

Proof. For a ﬁxed α ∈[0,4/7], let n be an integer such that αn ∈N, αn ≥2 and
(1−α)n ≥3. Consider the linear congestion game CG deﬁned as follows.
The set of players is N = N1 ∪N2, where |N1| = (1−α)n and |N2| = αn.
The set of resources is E = U ∪V ∪W, where U = {u j : j ∈[(1 −α)n]}, V =
{vj : j ∈[(1 −α)n]} and W = {w j,k : j ∈[(1 −α)n],k ∈[αn]}. Each resource in
U has latency function ℓU(x) = (4−α)n
2
x, each resource in V has latency function
ℓV(x) = (4−7α)n
2
x and each resource in W has latency function ℓW(x) = x. Note that
α ∈[0,4/7] guarantees (4−7α)n
2
≥0.
Each player i ∈N1 has two strategies: the ﬁrst strategy {ui+1,vi+1,vi+2} ∪
S
k∈[αn]{wi,k} and the second strategy {ui,vi}, where the sums over the indices
have to be interpreted circularly so that, for instance, u(1−α)n+1 = u1. Each player
i ∈N2 has only one available strategy given by S
k∈[(1−α)n]{wk,i,wk+1,i}, where again
the sums over the indices have to be interpreted circularly so that, for instance,
w(1−α)n+1,i = w1,i. Note that, by αn ≥2, the number of resources in W belonging to
the strategy of each player in N2 is exactly 2(1 −α)n; moreover, by (1 −α)n ≥3,
the ﬁrst and second strategy of each player in N1 are disjoint.
First of all, it is not difﬁcult to see that the strategy proﬁle σσσ∗in which each
player in N1 adopts her second strategy is a social optimum for CG. Now note that,
for each player i ∈N1, ci(σσσ∗) = (4−α)n
2
+ (4−7α)n
2
= 4(1 −α)n, whereas, for each
player i ∈N2, ci(σσσ∗) = 4(1−α)n since each player in N2 uses 2(1−α)n resources
in W each having congestion equal to 2. Hence, it follows that LLF(α) may choose
N2 as the set of coordinated players. We now show that, under this hypothesis, the
strategy proﬁle σσσ in which each player i ∈N1 adopts her ﬁrst strategy is a pure Nash
equilibrium for CGLLF(α).
For each player i ∈N1, ci(σσσ) = (4−α)n
2
+4 (4−7α)n
2
+3αn = (20−23α)n
2
since each
player i ∈N1 uses 1 resource in U having congestion 1, 2 resources in V both having
congestion 2 and αn resources in W each having congestion 3. Let σσσ′ be the strategy
proﬁle obtained from σσσ when player i deviates to her second strategy. In this case,
ci(σσσ′) = 2 (4−α)n
2
+3 (4−7α)n
2
= (20−23α)n
2
since player i uses 1 resource in U having
congestion 2 and 1 resource in V having congestion 3. Hence, it follows that σσσ is a
pure Nash equilibrium for CGLLF(α).
We are now left to compute the ratio
SUM(σσσ)
SUM(σσσ∗). To this aim, note that nj(σσσ) =
nj(σσσ∗) = 1 for each resource j ∈U, n j(σσσ) = 2 and nj(σσσ∗) = 1 for each resource
j ∈V, while, for each resource j ∈W, nj(σσσ) = 3 and nj(σσσ∗) = 2. We get

so that n is well deﬁned. Consider the linear congestion game CG deﬁned as follows.
The set of players is N = N1 ∪N2, where |N1| = (1−α)n and |N2| = αn.
The set of resources is E = U ∪W, where U = {uj : j ∈[(1 −α)n]} and W =
{w j,k : j ∈[(1 −α)n],k ∈[αn]}. Each resource in U has latency function ℓU(x) =

x and each resource in W has latency function ℓW(x) = x.
Each player i ∈N1 has two available strategies: the ﬁrst strategy {ui+1} ∪
S
k∈[αn], j∈

i{wi+j−1,k} and the second strategy {ui}, where again the sums
over the indexes have to be interpreted circularly. Note that, for each α ∈[4/7,1],
(θ−α)n

≤(1−α)n so that the number of resources in W belonging to the ﬁrst strat-
egy of each player in N1 is exactly α(θ−α)n2

and second strategy of each player are disjoint. Each player i ∈N2 has only one
available strategy given by S
k∈[(1−α)n], j∈[ αn

the indexes have to be interpreted circularly.
First of all, it is not difﬁcult to see that the strategy proﬁle σσσ∗in which each
player in N1 adopts her second strategy is a social optimum for CG. Now note that,
for each player i ∈N1, ci(σσσ∗) = α2(1−α)n3
4
, whereas, for each player i ∈N2, ci(σσσ∗) =
α2(1−α)n3
4
since each player in N2 uses αn
2 (1 −α)n resources in W each having
congestion equal to αn
2 . Hence, it follows that LLF(α) may choose N2 as the set of
coordinated players. We now show that, under this hypothesis, the strategy proﬁle
σσσ in which each player i ∈N1 adopts her ﬁrst strategy is a pure Nash equilibrium
for CGLLF(α).
For each player i ∈N1, ci(σσσ) = α2(1−α)n3

= α2(1−α)n3

since
each player i ∈N1 uses 1 resource in U having congestion 1 and α(θ−α)n2

resources
in W each having congestion (θ+α)n

σσσ when player i deviates to her second strategy. In this case, ci(σσσ′) = 2 α2(1−α)n3

11.3 Price of Anarchy of λ-Cover
In this section, we characterize the performance of λ-Cover by showing that,
for each λ ∈N \ {0}, PoAACG(λ-Cover) = 4λ−1
3λ−1 and PoALCG(λ-Cover) = 1 +
4λ+1
4λ(2λ+1). In order to show the upper bound for linear latency functions, we make
use again of the primal-dual method. To this aim, ﬁx a linear congestion game CG, a
social optimum σσσ∗and a pure Nash equilibrium σσσ induced by λ-Cover applied on
a particular choice of the set of coordinated players P. Again, for each j ∈E, we set
xj := nj(σσσ), o j := nj(σσσ∗) and sj := |{i ∈P : j ∈σ∗
i }|. In this case, by the deﬁnition
of λ-Cover, for each j ∈E, we have
sj ≥min{λ,o j}.
(11.6)
We obtain the following primal linear program LP := LP(σσσ,σσσ∗):

Observe that the proposed program is a subprogram of the one deﬁned for LLF and
does not depend on λ. This must not be surprising, since the parameter λ does not
affect the players’ costs directly, but only gives us an additional property on the
resources congestion which can be suitably exploited in the analysis of the dual
constraints, see Equation (11.6). The dual program DLP := DLP(σσσ,σσσ∗), obtained
by associating the variables (yi)i∈N\P with the ﬁrst family of constraints and the

Theorem 11.4. For each λ ∈N\{0}, PoALCG(λ-Cover) ≥1+
4λ+1
4λ(2λ+1).
Proof (Sketch). For a ﬁxed λ ∈N \ {0}, let n be an integer such that n ≥3λ + 1.
Consider the linear congestion game CG deﬁned as follows.
The set of players is N = N1 ∪N2, where |N1| = n−λ and |N2| = λ.
The set of resources of game CG is E = U ∪V, where U = {uj : j ∈[n−λ]} and
V = {v j : j ∈[n −λ]}. Each resource in U has latency function ℓU(x) = λ+1
λ x and
each resource in V has latency function ℓV(x) = x.
Each player i ∈N1 has two strategies: the ﬁrst strategy S
j∈[λ]{ui+λ+ j−1} ∪
S
j∈[λ+1]{vi+λ+ j−1} and the second strategy S
j∈[λ]{ui+j−1}∪S
j∈[λ]{vi+j−1}, where
again the sums over the indexes have to be interpreted circularly. Note that, since
n−λ ≥2λ +1, the ﬁrst and second strategy of each player in N1 are disjoint. Each
player i ∈N2 has only one available strategy given by the whole set of resources E,
so that N2 is a feasible choice for λ-Cover.
One can show that the strategy proﬁle σσσ in which each player i ∈N1 adopts her
ﬁrst strategy is a pure Nash equilibrium for CGλ-Cover. Now, let σσσ∗be the strategy
proﬁle in which each player in N1 adopts her second strategy. By computing the
ratio SUM(σσσ)
SUM(σσσ∗), we get the desired lower bound on PoA(CGλ-Cover).
⊓⊔
In the following, we provide a lower bound holding for general afﬁne functions.
Theorem 11.5. For each λ ∈N \ {0} and ε > 0, there exists an afﬁne congestion
game CG such that PoA(CGλ-Cover) ≥4λ−1

Proof. For a ﬁxed λ ∈N \ {0} and ε > 0, let n be an integer such that λ = o(n).
Consider the afﬁne congestion game CG deﬁned as follows.
The set of players is N = N1 ∪N2, where |N1| = n−λ and |N2| = λ.

The set of resources is E = U ∪V, where U = {uj : j ∈[n −λ]} and V = {vj :
j ∈[n−λ]}. Each resource in U has latency function ℓU(x) =
n−λ
8λ 2−7λ+1x and each
resource in V has constant latency function ℓV(x) = 1.
Each player i ∈N1 has two strategies: the ﬁrst strategy S
j∈[3λ−1]{ui+λ+j−1} and
the second strategy S
j∈[λ]{ui+j−1}∪V, where again the sums over the indexes have
to be interpreted circularly. Note that, since n >> λ, the ﬁrst and second strategy
of each player in N1 are disjoint. Each player i ∈N2 has only one available strategy
given by the whole set of resources E, so that N2 is a feasible choice for λ-Cover.
One can show the strategy proﬁle σσσ in which each player i ∈N1 adopts her
ﬁrst strategy is a pure Nash equilibrium for CGλ-Cover. Now, let σσσ∗be the strategy
proﬁle in which each player in N1 adopts her second strategy. By computing the
ratio SUM(σσσ)
SUM(σσσ∗), one can get the desired lower bound on PoA(CGλ-Cover).

2(h2−1) and rU(h) = 2h2+4h−1
2h(h+2) , with rL(0) :=
0. Note that, since rL(0) = 0, rU(∞) = 1, and rL(h + 1) = rU(h) for each h ≥1, it
follows that, for each α ∈[0,1], there exists a unique integer h := h(α) ≥1 such
that α ∈[rL(h),rU(h)]. We show that, for each α ∈[0,1], PoA(Scale(α)) ≤1 +

Also in this case we make use of the primal-dual method. To this aim, ﬁx a linear

possible
choices of the set of coordinated players P, let σσσ(P) be a pure Nash equilibrium

sj(P) := |{i ∈P : j ∈σ∗

cases, they are better.

the coordinated players, denoted as α. These two strategies, introduced by Rough-
garden [156], are deﬁned similarly as in atomic games: Largest Latency First as-
signs the coordinated players to the largest cost strategies in the social optimum,
while Scale simply employs the social optimum scaled by α. The best known upper

Appendix

Appendix A
Other Strategies to Improve the Efﬁciency of
Selﬁsh Outcomes
In Chapters 8–11, we considered the problem of improving the efﬁciency of self-
ish outcomes by means of either taxation mechanisms or Stackelberg strategies. In
this chapter, we brieﬂy describe two other mechanisms adopted to reduce the price
of anarchy in resource selection games: coordination mechanisms and cost-sharing
protocols. We provide the main deﬁnitions and the related work, so that the inter-
ested reader can deepen the state-of-the-art on these mechanisms and complement
the results provided for taxation mechanisms and Stackelberg strategies.
A.1 Coordination Mechanisms
A well-known class of optimization problems that is strictly connected with weighted
congestion games and, in particular, with linear load balancing games with unrelated
machines (Section 2.6), is that of machine scheduling problems. Similarly as in load
balancing problems, in more general machine scheduling problems we have a set of
machines and a set of jobs that can be assigned to the machines, but each machine
is equipped with a local scheduling policy that runs in a decentralized fashion and
decides how to schedule its jobs with the aim of minimizing a certain objective func-
tion (e.g., the makespan, the weighted total completion time, etc.). For their wide
applicability to several practical problems (e.g., CPU scheduling, queuing optimiza-
tion in routing problems, etc.), machine scheduling models have been constituting a
central topic in computer science and operation research for several decades.
With the advent of algorithm game theory, machine scheduling models have
been also studied from a game-theoretic perspective: each job is a selﬁsh player
and chooses a machine with the aim of minimizing her individual processing time,
regardless of the other players’ processing times. To reduce as much as possible
the impact of selﬁsh behavior (as usual, measured via the price of anarchy), we can
decide which kind of local scheduling policy must be adopted by the machines. A
set of such local scheduling policies, one for each machine, is called coordination
mechanism.

A Other Strategies to Improve the Efﬁciency of Selﬁsh Outcomes
Since the deﬁnition of coordination mechanisms [68], a long list of papers has
mostly focused on the design of policies in machine scheduling settings, aiming
to minimize the makespan (e.g., [1, 14, 19, 49, 50, 106, 111, 153]) or the to-
tal (weighted) completion time (e.g., [2, 72, 77, 105, 153]). Apart from machine
scheduling settings, coordination mechanisms have also been proposed for conges-
tion games [62]. A class of strategies that exhibits several similarities with coordina-
tion mechanisms is that of taxation mechanisms (see Chapter 8), where, instead of
a local scheduling policy, we have a local tax that is charged to the players selecting
a resource.
A.2 Cost-sharing Protocols
A class of strategies that is strictly connected with coordination mechanisms and has
not been considered in the previous chapters is that of cost-sharing games [8, 57, 64,
96, 97, 112, 123, 129, 130, 176]. In cost-sharing games we have a set of resources,
and the cost of each resource depends on the set of players selecting them. A cost-
sharing protocol, similarly to a local scheduling policy, decides how to share the
cost of each resource among the players selecting it, again, with the aim of guiding
players toward more efﬁcient equilibria. Two of the most well-known cost-sharing
protocols are the marginal contribution and the Shapley value [166].
Caragiannis et al. [56] studied the interplay between coordination mechanisms
and scheduling algorithms in more depth, and outlined interesting connections be-
tween coordination mechanisms and cost-sharing policies. Such connections are
exploited to improve the analysis of existing coordination mechanisms for the
weighted total completion time. Furthermore, they designed a coordination mech-
anisms that can be used to obtain a 1.81-approximation algorithm for the under-
lying optimization problem of minimizing the total weighted completion time (in
a centralized fashion); to the best of our knowledge, this is the best approxima-
tion guarantee among combinatorial polynomial-time algorithms for the considered
optimization problem. Anyway, when considering more general non-combinatorial
approaches (e.g., LP or convex relaxations), the best-approximation factor for the
problem of minimizing the the total weighted completion time was obtained by
Bansal et al. [15] and Li [119], who provided a (1.5 −c)-approximation algorithm
(for a small positive constant c) and improved the 1.5-approximation previously
achieved by Sethuraman and Squillante [165], Skutella [169]1.
1 The problem of scheduling jobs on unrelated machines aiming to minimize the total weighted
completion time has been studied extensively in the machine scheduling literature (for a detailed
list of some of the classic results see [117, Chapter 11]).

Appendix B
Miscellaneous
In this chapter of the appendix, we provide further notions/results that are strictly
related with the content of the book.
B.1 Duality Theory in Linear Programming
In this section, we give a brief overview of the duality theory in linear programming,
and we provide the main theorems which the primal-dual method (Chapter 3.1) is
based on. For further details, see Matouek and G¨artner [124].
Primal-Dual Pair
Let us consider the following linear program in n variables x1,...,xn and m con-
straints (excluding the constraints imposing the non-negativity of the variables):
LP :
max
c1x1 +c2x2 +...+cnxn
s.t.
a1,1x1 +a1,2x2 +...+a1,nxn ≤b1
a2,1x1 +a2,2x2 +...+a2,nxn ≤b2
...
am,1x1 +am,2x2 +...+am,nxn ≤bm
xi ≥0,
∀i ∈[n],
where (ai,j)i, j ∈Rnm and (ci)i ∈Rn are some ﬁxed real coefﬁcients. The dual pro-
gram of LP is a linear program in m variables y1,...,ym and n constraints:
DLP :
min
b1y1 +b2y2 +...+bmym

...
a1,ny1 +a2,ny2 +...+am,nyn ≥cn
yj ≥0,
∀j ∈[m].
Each variable y j of the dual is associated with the jth constraint of the primal, and
each variable xi of the primal is associated with the ith constraint of the dual. The
dual program DLP can be transformed into an equivalent optimization problem by
multiplying all the coefﬁcients by −1, and by replacing “≥” and “min” with “≤”
and “max”, respectively. If we consider such equivalent representation of DLP, and
we compute the dual of DLP, we obtain a linear program that is equivalent to the
initial linear program LP. The initial linear program LP is called primal program,
and the pair (LP, DLP) is called primal-dual pair.
Main Theorems
In the following, we provide the main theorems that relate optimal and feasible
solutions of the primal program to those of the corresponding dual. We say that a
linear program is feasible if it admits a solution and it is bounded if its optimal value
is ﬁnite.
Theorem B.1 (Weak Duality Theorem). Let xxx = (x1,...,xn) and yyy = (y1,...,ym)
be two feasible solutions of LP and DLP, respectively. Then ∑n
i=1 cixi ≤∑m
j=1 bjyj,
i.e., the value of any feasible solution of LP is a lower bound on the value of any
feasible solution of DLP. Furthermore, if the optimal value of LP is unbounded then
DLP is unfeasible.
Theorem B.2 (Strong Duality Theorem). Assume that LP is feasible and bounded,
and let xxx∗= (x∗
1,...,x∗
n) be an optimal solution. Then LP is feasible and bounded
too, and ∑n
i=1 cix∗
i = ∑m
j=1 bjy∗
j, where yyy∗= (y∗
1,...,y∗
m) is an optimal solution of
DLP.
Theorem B.3 (Complementary Slackness Conditions). Let xxx∗= (x∗
1,...,x∗
n) and
yyy∗= (y∗
1,...,n∗
n) be two feasible solutions of the primal and the dual program, re-
spectively. Then xxx∗and yyy∗are respectively optimal solutions for the primal and the
dual if and only if the following complementary slackness conditions hold:
1. for any i ∈[n], either x∗
i = 0, or ∑m
j=1 aj,iy j = ci (i.e., the dual constraint asso-
ciated with the ith primal variable is tight), or both equalities hold;
2. for any j ∈[m], if y∗
j = 0, or ∑n
i=1 ai, jxi = bj (i.e., the primal constraint associ-
ated with the jth dual variable is tight), or both equalities hold.

B.2 Smoothness Framework
173
B.2 Smoothness Framework
The smoothness analysis (Roughgarden [158]) has been introduced to give almost
tight upper bounds on the price of anarchy of several games, and applies success-
fully to the case of congestion games. In particular, an atomic congestion game CG
is (λ,µ)-smooth if, for any pair of strategy proﬁles σσσ,σσσ∗of CG, the following con-
dition holds:
∑
i∈N
costi(σσσ−i,σσσ∗
i ) ≤λ ·SUM(σσσ∗)+ µ ·SUM(σσσ).
(B.1)
A class G of congestions games is (λ,µ)-smooth if any game CG ∈G is (λ,µ)-
smooth. The following results give a characterization of the price of anarchy of
atomic congestion games with respect to the social function SUM.
Theorem B.4 (Roughgarden [158]). (i) Given a (λ,µ)-smooth class G of (weighted
or unweighted) congestion games with µ ∈[0,1] and λ ≥0, then PoA(G) ≤
λ
1−µ .
(ii) If G = U(C) for some class C of latency functions, we have the following char-
acterization of the price of anarchy:
PoA(G)
= inf

λ
1−µ : G is (λ,µ)-smooth

=
inf
µ∈[0,1),λ≥0

λ
1−µ : of(k +1) ≤λo f(o)+ µk f(k),∀f ∈C,k ∈Z≥0,o ∈Z≥0

.
(B.2)
One can easily see that the PoA bound for (exact) Nash equilibria provided in The-
orem 4.6 (Chapter 4) for unweighted games and that of Theorem B.4.ii are equiv-
alent. In particular, the inﬁmum of
λ
1−µ considered in (B.2) is equal to the value
γU(PoA0,G) used in Theorem 4.6. We also stress that the approach considered in
[158] to show the tight bound provided in (B.2) resorts to a technical lemma similar
to Lemma 4.4 (Chapter 4).
A tight characterization of the price of anarchy for weighted congestion games
holds under mild assumptions on the considered latency functions.
Theorem B.5 (Bhawalkar et al. [20]). Given a class of weighted congestion games
G = W(C), where C is closed under abscissa scaling, the following characterization
of the price of anarchy holds:
PoA(G)
= inf

λ
1−µ : G is (λ,µ)-smooth

174
B Miscellaneous
Similarly to the unweighted case, one can easily see that the PoA bound for (exact)
Nash equilibria provided in Theorem 4.1 (Chapter 4) for weighted games and that
of Theorem B.5 are equivalent. We also stress that the approach considered in [20]
to show the tight bound provided in (B.3) resorts to a technical lemma similar to
Lemma 4.1.
