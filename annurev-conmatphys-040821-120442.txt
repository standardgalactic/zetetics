Abstract
Understanding the physics of behavior in animals is a challenging and fasci-
nating area of research that has gained increasing attention in recent years.In
this review, we delve into the intricate temporal and spatial scales of animal
behavior for both individuals and collectives. We explore the experimental
and theoretical approaches used to study behavior, highlighting the impor-
tance of feedback loops, emergent behavior, and environmental factors in
shaping the actions of creatures great and small. The emergence of novel
technologies, such as high-speed imaging and tracking, has provided unpar-
alleled insight into the captivating nuances of animal behavior,and we review
how these insights have been used to validate physics-based models of ani-
mal behavior. We also consider the potential applications of this research in
robotics and artificial intelligence, identify new areas for exploration, and
envision the possibility of further breakthroughs that will illuminate the
complex dynamics of animal behavior.

1. INTRODUCTION
In physics, the term behavior typically refers to an observed state or set of dynamics for a system,
a notion that has precise meaning and is reproducible in nonliving systems. In contrast, living
organisms are inherently “messy”—they are complex, dynamic, robust, adaptive, out of equilib-
rium systems whose actions are constrained by physics across multiple length scales and timescales,
body morphology, and physiology, as well as evolutionary history; as a result, widely varying strate-
gies can achieve a similar outcome. A fundamental distinction of living systems is the presence
of an intentionality or motivation, which, although challenging to infer, crucially underlies the
actions of animals and gives rise to diverse behaviors despite similar or even identical external
conditions. As a result, the notion of behavior in living systems is complex and typically impre-
cise (1) but loosely defined as an action or set of actions performed by an organism or a group of
organisms.
Though we do not yet have an understanding of these systems that affords the use of precise
physics language, recent advances in data collection and analysis techniques make this an exciting
time to make progress studying the physics of animal behavior. Here, we cover some of the fas-
cinating facets of animal behavior, discussing what is known and identifying open questions. We
note that this field is still relatively new and largely unexplored, and we have therefore deliberately
prioritized breadth over depth in this review. Our primary goal is to provide a somewhat compre-
hensive picture of the state of the field that highlights important concepts and connections rather
than delves into mathematical details for a few specific topics. However, when possible, we have
included references that do provide mathematical details for interested readers.
In this article, we focus on topics that are critical for animal behavior and that are at the fore-
front of this large and fascinating field, beginning with introductions to broad research directions
and ending with a discussion section that draws connections between them and points to new
research directions. First, features at small length scales are discussed in Section 2. Experimental
imaging and mechanical characterization techniques, such as atomic force microscopy, have en-
abled precise measurements of microscopic biological features (2). Section 3 focuses on animal
movements, which are crucial for many animal behaviors. At macroscopic length scales, machine-
learning-based methods enable robust, markerless animal tracking techniques (e.g., 3) that can
provide three-dimensional (3D) kinematic data of animals moving in natural or naturalistic en-
vironments. Mathematical and robotic modeling techniques, as well as theoretical advances in
understanding the physics of complex substrates, have enabled systematic exploration of how
movements depend on environmental physics and body morphology and have sometimes even
led to insights into the macroscopic consequences of microscopic features. Section 4 discusses
how diverse animals manipulate environmental substrates to create protective structures, which
must balance mechanical stability with ventilation and thermoregulation needs of inhabitants. Fi-
nally, we close in Section 5 with a comprehensive discussion of exciting research directions and
important open questions where we feel a physics approach can lead to important contributions.
2. FUNCTIONAL TEXTURES
Textures on biological surfaces span a broad range of morphologies, including features that inter-
act with other surfaces, liquids, light, or sound. Linking the diversity of microscopic features to
macroscopic function(s) can be challenging for several reasons, including the following: (a) Rele-
vant length scales for a diversity of microscopic phenomena are similar and/or have overlapping
ranges; (b) many surfaces are likely multifunctional at macroscopic length scales; and (c) textures
are the result of biological evolutionary processes, which can introduce unique and unusual con-
straints based on evolutionary and behavioral histories. Here, we introduce a few key microscopic
326
Riiska et al.

interactions that are known to have macroscopic consequences. We have separated these interac-
tions from the behaviors discussed later because these interactions are important for all behaviors
discussed throughout the rest of the manuscript. In Sections 3 and 4, we expand some of these
microscopic to macroscopic relations to encompass collective behavior.
2.1. Mechanical Interactions Between Surfaces
The structural features on biological surfaces can contribute to enhanced or reduced friction, an
animal’s ability to cling to and move along challenging surfaces, as well as the ability to latch
onto other small features. The interplay between electrostatic forces and mechanical properties
underlies many of these interactions.
2.1.1. Dry adhesion. For small surface features (≲1 µm), attractive forces referred to as van
der Waals forces can arise from charge-fluctuation-induced-dipoles of nearby apolar atoms or
molecules. These forces can be significant but are very short range; as a result, mechanical en-
gagement of interacting objects is crucial—even small amounts of roughness can cause separations
large enough to make these forces negligible. Despite this sensitivity, a diversity of animals,
from insects and spiders (2) to lizards (15), have been shown to utilize van der Waals forces for
movement. In particular, the limbs and feet of these animals possess highly specialized hair-like
microstructures, referred to as setae, that enable them to move along steep, vertical, and even in-
verted surfaces (16). These interactions are enhanced by a direction-dependent engagement of
the setae with an underlying substrate, achieved through contact pressure modulations and/or
anisotropic material properties, which allows animals to controllably engage and disengage these
forces. For example, each foot of the tokay gecko is covered with thousands of 200-nm-wide se-
tae tips (17) that enable these animals to climb and move through trees with ease (Figure 1a).
The overall adhesive strength is influenced by substrate roughness, where surface features smaller
than the setae act to reduce adhesion (18), and the presence of moisture, where small amounts of
liquid act to enhance these forces (16).
For larger length scales (≳10 µm), steric interactions between complex textures and shapes
can be important. For instance, commensurate surfaces, nonconvex structures, and geometrically
interlocking features like hooks and barbs can provide surprising strength and enable a wide va-
riety of adhesion phenomena at both the individual and collective scales. For example, scanning
electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy of bird feathers revealed features that func-
tion like Velcro, utilizing probabilistic, highly directional, and reversible attachments between
thousands of (∼10 µm) cilia to enhance lift production during flight by preventing feather sep-
aration (19). At the collective scale, tarsal claws on limbs allow several species of ants to grip
one another and interlock limbs with forces strong enough to facilitate the formation of large,
structurally stable aggregates such as bridges, towers, and bivouacs (20). Recent experimental and
computational soft matter physics work has investigated how the shape, convexity, and aspect
ratio of constituent “particles”—i.e., simplified models for individual limbs or complex shapes
of animals—like rods (21), staples (22), and a variety of other interlocking particles (23, 24) can
passively enhance the mechanical strength and cohesiveness of aggregations.
2.1.2. Sliding friction. The frictional interaction resulting from the relative movement be-
tween two surfaces in contact provides another broad class of complex and crucial interactions
between animals and environmental substrates. The familiar Coulomb–Amonton Law (25) of fric-
tion, which states F = µN, assumes that the frictional force, F, is proportional only to the applied
load, N, and the coefficient of friction, µ, between the two materials in contact. However, tech-
niques developed over the past few decades to probe microscopic interactions between surfaces

Riiska et al.

in relative motion (26, 27) have revealed that friction at smaller scales is a much more compli-
cated phenomenon that can depend on many other factors such as temperature, sliding velocity,
surface chemistry, contact area, and elasticity (28, 29). Although newer models have incorporated
some of these dependencies (30), the microscopic origins of friction, as well as how it relates to
macroscopic phenomena, are not well understood (31).
Work over the past few decades (e.g., 32) has investigated the influence of microscopic textures
on frictional interactions, particularly in the context of moving animals. For example, in limbless
animals such as snakes, only the underside of the animal contacts a substrate, so, presumably, the
belly skin textures are highly specialized to enhance movement. Atomic force microscopy and
scanning electron microscopy of shed snake skins has revealed that many snakes possess a simi-
lar structure: head-to-tail oriented micron-sized spikes that protrude from the skin (33). Though
there is currently no direct link between microscopic texture and macroscopic friction, math-
ematical modeling has shown that direction-dependent frictional interactions can be beneficial
for slithering snakes (34). Tribological studies of California kingsnake skin have shown that the
scales have frictional properties desirable for snakes, low friction for forward sliding, high friction
for backward and sideways sliding, possibly attributed to their direction-dependent microstruc-
ture (6) (Figure 1b). Recently, Rieser et al. (35) discovered a convergent evolutionary loss of this
spiked skin structure (in favor of a much more isotropic one) in two distantly related sidewinding
snake species. Mathematical modeling by the authors indicated that this combination of behav-
ioral and hypothesized frictional adaptations would be beneficial for the movements of these
animals.
2.2. Interactions with Water
The geometry of a liquid drop in contact with a surface is set by the relative strength of up to
three competing forces: the interactions of the liquid molecules with each other (liquid–liquid);
with molecules in the surrounding air (liquid–air); and with the molecules in the underlying sub-
strate (liquid–substrate). Liquid–liquid interactions dominate the forces experienced by droplets
suspended in air, and thus droplets are spherical to minimize liquid–air interfacial energy, which
is set by the surface area. For droplets interacting with a solid surface as well, all three forces can
be important, and the droplet shape can be deformed by the underlying substrate. Two regimes
are particularly important for biological systems: hydrophilicity, i.e., the spreading of a droplet
on a surface that occurs when the liquid–substrate attraction dominates, and hydrophobicity, i.e.,
the reduction of droplet–substrate contact area that occurs when the liquid–substrate attraction
is negligible when compared to the liquid–liquid and liquid–air attractions. These interactions
can be influenced by gradients in surface chemistry, texture, elasticity (36), and light absorption/
temperature (37), and any other effects that may produce asymmetric contact lines or contact line
instabilities, which can serve as mechanisms that drive fluid flow (38).
The presence of microscopic structures has an effect on both wetting regimes (39). For hy-
drophobic surfaces, water penetration into surface asperities is highly energetically unfavorable.
As a result, a layer of air can be trapped within or between structural features, leading to superhy-
drophobic behavior (40) (see Figure 1c,subpanel i).Superhydrophobicity is particularly important
for both individuals and collectives. For example, in a wide variety of animals that live in arid en-
vironments, the condensation, collection, and transport of water droplets can be vitally important
for health (41, 42); in wet climates, water droplet shedding can be essential in animals, like flying
birds and insects, where weight and stability are crucially important (43). In addition, hierarchical
structures, such as those discovered on springtail insects, can create a water-impenetrable barrier
that prevents the animal from suffocating in wet environments (7) (Figure 1c). Superhydrophobic
surfaces can also facilitate the removal of dirt and debris from the skins of diverse animals. This

self-cleansing mechanism, whereby beaded water droplets collect particulate material as they roll
along a surface (8), can be important to help protect the animal from dangers like skin-borne
parasites and other infections. In addition, the removal of foreign objects from an animal’s skin,
particularly those that may alter light–surface interactions, can be important for maintaining a
camouflaged appearance (44). Finally, insect aggregations also take advantage of superhydropho-
bicity: Bees in the exterior of an assembly have been observed to orient their bodies in a uniform
direction and tuck their heads under the abdomens of bees directly above them, forming a shin-
gled curtain that effectively allows rain to drip off (45); and assemblies of fire ants have increased
hydrophobicity compared with individuals (46), due to the presence of trapped air bubbles within
a floating raft.
2.3. Interactions with Light
Coloration and visual appearance are crucial for many biological behaviors (47). As a result, many
biological systems have developed clever ways to exploit optical phenomena. The underlying
mechanisms that are responsible for an appearance often occur at nanoscopic to microscopic
length scales, with observed colors resulting from a combination of structural textures and
inherent pigmentation.
Structural colors refer to the appearance of colors produced by incident light waves interact-
ing with surfaces that are decorated with diverse and often hierarchical microscopic textures. The
optical phenomena underlying these light–structure interactions are responsible for a wide vari-
ety of visual effects observed in biology, including bright coloration, iridescence, and polarization
of light. We briefly describe a few important optical phenomena here. First, constructive inter-
ference is produced from layered materials, decorated with periodic arrays of microstructures,
layered with alternating low and high indices of refraction that can act as Bragg reflectors (48).
The resulting perception of specific colors depends on the indices of refraction, the thicknesses of
the layers (compared to the wavelength of the incident/reflected light), the viewing angle, as well
as the color sensitivity of the viewer.1 This effect is the origin of coloration on many butterflies
and moths (51). For example, such structures on Morpho butterflies are responsible for their blue
coloration and iridescence (10) (Figure 1d). Second, diffraction occurs when the wavelength of
an incident light wave is comparable with the feature sizes on a surface; a strong angular depen-
dence is introduced into the transmitted and reflected wavelengths and, therefore, the perceived
colors. The angular dependence of reflected light is responsible for iridescent colors observed on
many animals, including insects and birds (47, 52). Third, scattering occurs when the wavelength
of the incident light is much larger than the features on the impinged surface. Many blues in the
natural world that are independent of viewing angle are the result of scattering (48). At the scale
of a single organism, such as in insects, birds, or fishes, structural effects produce a diversity of vi-
sual appearances, including bright, shiny, and/or metallic colors, and iridescence. At the collective
scale, these effects, combined with the coordinated movements of birds, fish, and insects, can pro-
duce dramatic and dynamic visual displays that interfere with the visual perception of predators
and/or transfer information regarding predation across the collective (53–57).
Pigmentation, in contrast to structural features that produce the appearance of color, results
from a few types of specialized color-producing cells referred to as chromatophores (47, 58). Pig-
mentary chromatophores contain pigments that absorb specific wavelengths of light, whereas
iridophores (and leucocytes) contain structures that specularly (and diffusely) scatter light (58).
1Visual perception of color is also crucial but outside the scope of this article. We refer interested readers to
other resources, e.g., References 49 and 50, for more information.

Riiska et al.

Some animals, such as cephalopods (58) and chameleons (59), can actively change their appearance
through the controlled expansion and contraction of chromatophores, enabling rapid, precisely
controlled, and coordinated changes in coloration and patterning that is used for camouflage,
communication, and, at least for chameleons, thermoregulation (60).
3. MOVEMENT
Though living organisms appear to move through complex and diverse natural environments
with ease, successful movements require the integration of electrical, chemical, and physical sig-
nals across many length scales and timescales. Even simple movements are the complex result
of hierarchical internal signals, from neuronal activity2 at the smallest scale to the movements
of limbs, tails, and other body parts at an intermediate scale, to the movement of individu-
als and groups of organisms at the largest scale. This section focuses on how environmental
physics constrains the sets of possible movements for different body morphologies and for dif-
ferent substrates. Essentially, we make the simplifying assumption that animals can generate
movement (e.g., their muscles can generate necessary torques), and we focus on what strategies
of movement may or may not be effective in different environments and why. In particular, we
survey simple mathematical models for movements, as well as the benefits and challenges con-
ferred by the physics of different environments. A challenge for mathematical and numerical
modeling tools is their ability to capture detailed dynamics of both animals and environmental
dynamics across disparate spatial and temporal scales, as fully resolved numerical calculations can
be prohibitively expensive and detailed mathematical models can be analytically intractable (see
Figure 2). To understand dynamics within these systems, simple robotic models have proven
invaluable and led to deep insights into a variety of systems and phenomena (63).
3.1. Movement in Fluids
Movements of animals within fluids are described by the full 3D, time-varying, incompressible
Navier–Stokes (NS) equation, which can be derived from principles of fluid momentum balance
and mass conservation. Solving this partial differential equation (PDE) can be challenging, given
the complex and time-varying boundary conditions that moving and deformable animal surfaces
can impose (70). As a result, simplified models have been developed to describe movements. These
models often assume animals are immersed in fully-developed and steady-state flows, that body-
fluid interactions are highly localized, and that body segments are perfectly rigid. Models differ
depending on the body morphology of the animal—which can be quite different for animals that
take advantage of buoyancy to swim versus animals that must actively generate lift through flap-
ping flight—as well as the relative importance of viscous and inertial fluid forces. The interplay
between morphology, environmental physics, and movement strategies comprises a fascinating
realm that warrants further study; and though we currently lack a mechanistic understanding of
how these elements are linked, empirical observations reveal a diversity of morphologies within
and across environments. As a result, animal-fluid interactions vary widely, and different mod-
els have been developed based on body morphology and movement as well as the surrounding
fluid. Thus, this section is divided into two parts: movement in air and movement in water.
2How these signals are integrated and coordinated across length scales and timescales to produce movement
is an exciting and active area of interdisciplinary research that spans physicists, neuroscientists, biologists, and
engineers. Though this is outside the scope of this article, we refer interested readers to References 61 and 62
for more information.

We note that movements in more complex environments, e.g., at air–water interfaces (71) or in
non-Newtonian fluids (72),are also active areas of research but are outside the scope of this article.
We refer interested readers to review articles (71, 72) for more information on these fascinating
topics.
Though there are significant differences based on the surrounding fluid environment, there is
a common parameter used to describe the relative importance of forces across all fluid systems.
The only nondimensional parameter to appear in the NS equation is the Reynolds number, Re,
which is used to distinguish regimes in which different forces dominate observed dynamics. In
particular, Re represents the relative importance of inertial forces compared to dissipation forces
and is defined as Re = ρvℓ/µ, where ρ is the fluid density, v is the speed of the object, ℓis a
332
Riiska et al.

characteristic length scale of the object, and µ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid. Different
regimes are important for different animals, depending on their size, speed, and the medium in
which they move. For instance, for microorganisms moving in water, inertial forces are negligible
(Re j 1), and as a result, no net translations or rotations can occur without active and time-
irreversible movements of the body (more in Section 3.2).
When inertial forces are not negligible, the movements of wings, fins, tails, and other ap-
pendages generate significant fluid flows, and attached and detaching vortices can become
important during movement. A variety of animals operate in this regime; for instance, flying in-
sects experience Reynolds numbers between 10 and 104 (73), flying birds experience Reynolds
numbers between 103 and 105, and swimming fishes operate at Reynolds numbers between 103
and 108 (74). The complex nature of fluid flows in these ranges of Reynolds numbers often makes
analytical calculations difficult. For full, time-dependent, 3D fluid flows, tools such as compu-
tational fluid dynamics (CFD) have been developed to numerically solve PDEs. Though these
tools are powerful, they contain many parameters and are computationally costly, particularly in
systems in which resolving disparate length and/or timescales is important (73). This difficulty
can make generating broad insights, such as developing an understanding of individual variabil-
ity or comparing dynamics across diverse systems, challenging. Recent work has applied machine
learning techniques to identify solutions to NS (75), which may help to overcome some of these
challenges and contribute to new insights linking sets of parameters to interesting changes in
dynamics.
In contrast, simplified mathematical models that treat appendages like wings, fins, and tails
as thin, rotationally actuated plate-like objects that are pushed through a surrounding fluid have
led to a deeper understanding across diverse systems. Though morphology and control can vary
widely across animals, appendages are typically treated as rigid with a uniform cross-section, with
their orientation relative to their velocity (referred to as the angle of attack, α) setting the scale of
three important forces: the thrust, FT, which acts in the direction of motion; the drag, FD, which
directly opposes the motion; and the lift, FL, which is directed upward and can have contributions
from either thrust or drag. For small α, a plate slices through the air and generates very little
force. For α ∼90°, a plate plows through the air, and all forces are aligned or antialigned with
the direction of motion. For intermediate α, out-of-plane force components can contribute to
lift. In addition to appendages, the morphology and control of the animal body can influence and
contribute to these forces as well.
3.1.1.
Movement in air. For winged movement through air (for example, Figure 2a,
subpanel i), the wings provide the predominant forces necessary for flight. The cross-section of
each wing is essentially a long, thin blade that is attached to the body at a hinge point (see
Figure 2a, subpanel iii). Internal muscles hold the wings in an extended configuration and
drive the back-and-forth angular rotations during flapping flight. For flying and gliding, inter-
mediate angles of attack are used to generate thrust and lift, the latter of which must at least
balance the weight of the animal for sustained flight. Shallow angles of attack that do not provide
sufficient lift are used for controlled descent and landing. Strategies for movement through air
can vary widely across individuals, species, and taxa and include the ability to modulate the stroke
amplitude, the stroke frequency, the stoke midpoint, and the angles of attack, and the symmetry of
the left and right wing strokes and angles of attack can all influence flight dynamics. The complex
bone and muscle structures present in vertebrate wings and tails provide additional mechanisms
to control flight, such as the ability to actively change the morphology of these appendages.
Quasisteady models (76) have successfully modeled a wide range of insect, bat, and bird
flight (77). Key assumptions in these models include the following: (a) the wing is immersed in a
www.annualreviews.org • Physics of Animal Behavior
333

fully developed flow (and therefore, lift and drag coefficients are constants, determined empirically
from complementary experiments), (b) the wing is not very flexible, and (c) there is no flow along
the wing. As a result, the angle of attack and the current velocity of the wing are sufficient to de-
scribe the forces on the wing and blade-element analysis (78), which assumes that an object can
be divided into many infinitesimal elements that are treated independently; thus, the net force is
given by the superposition of forces on all the individual elements. These models provide power-
ful tools that typically work well for dynamics averaged over a cycle and have led to broad insights
that have related morphology, wing kinematics, maneuverability, and flight dynamics in diverse
animals, including insects, bats, and birds (77), and their use in recent work has elucidated evolu-
tionary links between wing morphology and function in moths (79). However, because quasisteady
models are not directly modeling the fluid dynamics around the wings, more sophisticated meth-
ods are required to match instantaneous, 3D dynamics, particularly when multiple length scales
and timescales are important. In some systems, CFD can help where simple models may fail, but
often, full simulations are extremely computationally costly (73). In these situations, robotic mod-
els can be invaluable. With an appropriately scaled system, any physically realizable flow can be
generated experimentally. For instance, a pair of large robotic wings driven periodically through
mineral oil (see Figure 2a, subpanel iii) enabled the visualization and detailed study of scaled-up
fluid flows at Re relevant to those experienced by flying insects (80). This experimental system
was crucial in developing a theoretical understanding of how insects fly. Robotic models are also
useful for linking effects across multiple spatial scales. For instance, recent work revealed that tiny
barbs on bird feathers act to create a reversible Velcro-like attraction that can be engaged during
flight to enhance lift generation (19).
Such models are also excellent tools to explore the potential interactions or benefits con-
ferred by multiple individuals interacting through locally induced time-dependent fluid flows.
For instance, a pair of honeybee-inspired robotic wings revealed a potentially beneficial enhanced
collective effect: For closely separated wings flapping at an optimum phase difference, measured
air flows were faster than that of the sum of noninteracting individuals’ flows (81). This effect was
shown to contribute to efficient ventilation of honeybee nests (82); however, the implications of
synergistic air flows on collective insect flight have yet to be explored. Neighbor-induced effects
that enhance airflow or minimize energy consumption might prove particularly beneficial for in-
sects, such as monarch butterflies (83) and hoverflies (84), which have been observed to migrate
over large distances.
Extensive studies on the kinematics and energy considerations of collective bird flight over var-
ious scales reveal how individuals can attain aerodynamic benefits by leveraging the environment
and the behavior of their flock mates.When migrating long distances,birds save energy by thermal
soaring, in which they fly into rising currents of air to gain altitude at a low energy cost (85, 86).
White storks navigate thermals as collectives, with leaders navigating toward the centers while
other birds merely follow; however, followers leave thermals more quickly and tend to migrate
shorter distances than leaders due to this increased energy cost (87). The classic “V-formation”
associated with migrating flocks can impart some energetic advantages provided that individu-
als are positioned to leverage the vortices shed by their neighbors. For example, ibises flying in
V-formation can maximally exploit the upwash created by neighboring birds by flapping their
wings nearly in phase with one another (88). Conversely, other species may travel in forma-
tions that are aerodynamically neutral or even disadvantageous: For instance, the cluster-shaped
flocks formed by pigeons actually contribute to an increase in individual energy expenditure, as
pigeons flap their wings at a higher frequency when in a cluster than when isolated (89). One
hypothesis as to why animals travel in energetically costly formations is that group cohesion is
enhanced due to improved visual contact and information transfer.

3.1.2. Movement in water. Many water-dwelling animals (for example, Figure 2b, subpanel i)
have some natural buoyancy, making lift generation in aquatic environments significantly less
important than in air. As a result, the body morphologies, movement strategies, and fluid inter-
actions are different and much more diverse than for flying animals. A thorough description of
aquatic life is outside the scope of this article (for more information, we refer interested readers to
Reference 90, and references therein), but here, we focus just on fishes. Even with this restriction,
diversity in form and movement patterns is vast, but swimming modes and propulsion mechanisms
are divided into two broad functional groups: body and caudal fin (BCF) movement and median
and paired fin (MPF) movement (65). BCF swimmers generate most of their propulsive force us-
ing a combination of lateral (side-to-side) body and tail undulations, with waves of body flexion
originating somewhere along the body (this varies across species) and propagated toward the tail,
often with amplitude increasing toward the tail. Because of this movement style, body forms for
these fishes tend to be streamlined (90).
Models for force generation in BCF swimmers build on slender body theory (91), which es-
sentially says that undulations act to accelerate body segments (Figure 2b, subpanel ii). Fluid
elements in contact with the body resist these changes in velocity, as if there was an additional
“virtual” mass (which can be much larger than the body’s actual mass) associated with the body
segment. For MPF swimmers, the body remains rigid while thrust is generated from the cyclic
movements of fins along the body, including pectoral fins (symmetric, paired fins located on the
sides of a swimmer), dorsal fins (along the top of the animal), and ventral fins (along the bottom
of the animal) (90). There is a large diversity of body and fin morphologies in this swimmer type,
but blade-element approaches (see Section 3.1.1) have been applied to estimate forces and predict
movements resulting from pectoral fins for this body type (92).
Though these models have had success in matching time-averaged quantities associated with
swimming,they do not directly model the time-resolved 3D fluid flows generated by animal move-
ments. As a result, turbulent flows, as well as the generation of and interactions with vortices,
cannot be captured within these models. As with movements in air, tools like CFD can be use-
ful for calculating complex fluid flows, though computations for systems with multiple length
scales and timescales can be challenging and computationally costly. For these systems, experi-
mental studies involving simple physical models can provide new insights. For instance, a dead
fish placed into the alternating vortex wake structure generated by water flowing past a cylinder
revealed a fascinating adaptation of trout: A resonance between the wake structure and the passive
body undulations it induced enabled the dead fish to swim upstream (93). Robotic models allow
measurements that relate flow fields, body kinematics, and energy consumption to understand
complex aquatic locomotor behaviors (Figure 2b, subpanel iii). More recent studies revealed that
small-scale textures present on shark skins may enhance thrust and reduce drag, thereby increasing
swimming speed (94).
Experiments and robotic models can also provide insights into and test hypotheses about col-
lective interactions, such as how individuals in fish schools might modulate their position and
tail-beat frequency to leverage the vortices shed by their neighbors. Weihs (95) proposed that the
most advantageous configuration of a fish school would be a diamond pattern that allowed a given
individual to exploit the vortex streets shed by the two nearest leading fish, whereas it would be
disadvantageous for fish to swim directly behind each other. However, experimental evidence for
this idealized diamond formation is lacking (96), and in-line swimming might actually save en-
ergy (97). Li et al. (98) identified a behavioral rule they termed vortex phase matching to describe
how an individual fish could save energy by regulating its tail-beat phase according to a linear
function of the distance to its nearest neighbor in front and observed this behavior in pairs of
goldfish. Thandiackal & Lauder (97) performed experiments on brook trout swimming behind a

flapping robotic foil that shed wakes similar to fish, observing that the trout swam in line behind
the foil to exploit the wake and reduce energy expenditure and that they performed vortex phase
matching.
3.2. Movement in Sand
A diversity of natural habitats contain sand, mud, and other deformable materials. Experimen-
tal work over the past two decades has shown that these substrates are highly dissipative and that
disturbances introduced by the movements of animals are incredibly short-ranged. These observa-
tions led researchers to a surprising realization: Resistive force theory (RFT), originally developed
to describe the movements of microorganisms swimming in highly viscous environments (99),
worked well for describing locomotion within dry sand (100). RFT assumes that the body of an
undulatory locomotor can be divided into many infinitesimal segments (Figure 2c, subpanel ii)
and that internally driven postural changes push each segment through the environment, which
in turn resists this motion. For low-Re fluids, resistive forces are proportional to the speed of the
segment (99). For dry granular materials, these resistive forces are typically measured empirically.
Experiments of intruders pushed through 0.3 mm dry glass beads revealed that steady-state forces
are independent of speeds up to around 50 cm/s (101), a range in which many animals operate. In
this highly dissipative regime, the instantaneous center-of-mass translational and rotational dis-
placements are then determined by satisfying the condition that inertia is negligible,and therefore,
there is no net force on the body of a locomotor.
Remarkably, RFT has been shown to quantitatively agree with experimental measurements
of the forward speeds for the undulatory movements of the sandfish skink (Figure 2c, sub-
panel i) (100) and the shovelnose snake (102) within dry granular media. Furthermore, for each
system, the experimentally measured waveforms were shown to nearly coincide with the waveform
predicted by RFT to produce the maximal displacement. Subsequent studies demonstrated similar
agreements between RFT predictions and a variety of other experimental systems, including the
shovelnose snake on the surface of sand (103) and the sidewinder rattlesnake (which periodically
lifts portions of its body as it moves) on sand and hard ground (104). Recent theoretical work (105)
developed a continuum plasticity-based model of granular media that rationalized the efficacy of
RFT in granular media as a result of the locality of force and flow fields (in contrast to viscous flu-
ids, where these are longer range) and predicts the applicability of RFT to wet granular media as
well as other highly dissipative soft materials. Once these predictions are experimentally verified,
then RFT provides a powerful and general tool for describing steady-state movements through a
variety of substrates and understanding forces animals must overcome to generate movement.
As with the simplified models discussed in other sections, RFT does not directly model envi-
ronmental constituents and, therefore, cannot capture the time-resolved environmental dynamics.
Furthermore, an underlying assumption of granular RFT is that the environment resistance to
movement is a steady-state response. Therefore, situations involving the accelerations of grains,
static friction between an animal and environment, or reinteractions with previously encountered
material are not easily described within this framework. For these more complex situations, dis-
crete element method (DEM) (106) can be used to model all interactions between individual grains
of sand as well as interactions between a locomotor body and grains of sand. As with CFD, DEM
simulations can be computationally expensive to run, and simple robotic models can be a good
alternative to modeling the dynamics that arise from the complex interactions between environ-
mental substrates and individuals as well as groups of animals. For instance, a robotic model of the
sandfish skink (Figure 2c, subpanel iii) demonstrated the importance of head shape in generating
lift forces during subsurface movement (68). A robotic model of a sea turtle moving through a
loosely packed granular substrate revealed that robot performance degraded significantly when
336
Riiska et al.

subsequent steps placed the flippers into previously created footprints (107). Similar decreases in
performance were noted for a robotic mudskipper fish (108) as well as a robotic snake (103) upon
reinteractions with previously disturbed material. These combined results show that the interplay
among body morphology, coordination, and timing is important for movement, and they provide
insights into the benefits and drawbacks of various movement strategies for individuals. To our
knowledge, collective movements in granular media have not been explored. Previous work on in-
dividuals suggests that, for dry sand, avoiding previously disturbed material could be an important
strategy. In contrast, for movements through cohesive, compactable materials, the strategy may
be different. Although the physics of movement through these environments has not been inves-
tigated, animals such as moose and coyotes that travel long distances in snowy environments have
been observed to follow in the footprints of other animals (which contain more compacted snow)
rather than walk on freshly fallen snow, presumably to reduce their energy expenditure (109, 110).
3.3. Movement on Solid Substrates
Simple mathematical mechanics-based models have been shown to capture the movements of
diverse legged animals on rigid substrates. For instance, the experimentally measured center-of-
mass velocities and patterns of thrust generation from each foot were found to be qualitatively
similar across a diversity of walking animals, including turkeys, dogs, monkeys, and rams. An ob-
served alternating exchange between kinetic and gravitational potential energy of the centers of
masses of these animals led to the realization that walking can be modeled as an inverted pen-
dulum (IP), in which the body is represented as a mass that is vaulted over a rigid leg in static
contact with the ground at each step (111). A similar analysis of experimental measurements of
trotting, running, and hopping in diverse animals, including cockroaches (Figure 2d, subpanel i),
quail, and kangaroos, revealed that the energetics and dynamics can be modeled as a single bounc-
ing spring-mass system, referred to as a spring-loaded inverted pendulum (SLIP) (see Figure 2d,
subpanel ii) (112). In this model, the compliant “virtual leg” is in static contact with the ground,
and the center-of-mass kinetic and gravitational potential energies are interchanged with the elas-
tic energy of the spring, whose stiffness is a parameter that is fit to achieve quantitative agreement
with experimental measurements. Modified approaches that build off of SLIP, referred to as lat-
eral leg spring models, have been shown to agree with experimentally observed center-of-mass
dynamics for running (113) and climbing (114) in diverse animals.
Simple robots have proven especially useful as physical models in movements on hard ground,
where computational modeling can be challenging. For instance, the impulsive interactions be-
tween a foot and the ground introduce multiple important timescales that can make accurate
simulations challenging and computationally expensive. In contrast, robots like the SLIP-inspired
hexapod RHex (Figure 2d, subpanel iii) (115) readily enable comparisons of performance across
a wide range of locomotor parameters, such as leg compliance, coupling, and coordination as well
as environment parameters, such as stiffness, roughness, and inclination, without the need for nu-
merical computations. These robotic models have enabled investigations of active versus passive
control and revealed how mechanically asymmetric interactions between limbs and environmen-
tal features can passively enhance movement over rough terrain (116). Similarly, studies of simple
two-legged systems (117) have demonstrated the utility of passive actuation in efficient walking.
At smaller scales, asymmetric loading properties of lab-created gecko-inspired nanostructured ad-
hesive pads enabled quadrupedal robots to climb vertical walls (118). These results highlight the
potential importance of passive mechanical adaptations for individual animals moving in complex
environments.
Many animal collectives move in hard-ground environments, for instance, during stampedes,
herding, migrating, and foraging. Though it would seem that coordinated movements (e.g.,
www.annualreviews.org • Physics of Animal Behavior
337

synchronized stepping) may be important to avoid injury during rapid locomotion in dense groups,
there is not much investigation on the mechanics or dynamics of collective movement. Instead,
most nonhuman work has focused on how individuals communicate and make group decisions
(e.g., in baboons; 119). One exception was the study of dense sheep collectives moving through a
constricted opening. Sheep were observed to clog while trying to squeeze through the opening,
but the presence of an obstacle near the constriction altered the group’s behavior and enhanced
flow by reducing clogging events (120).Though interactions within and dictated by heterogeneous
environments have not been explored much, there may be interesting behavioral or mechanical
adaptations that facilitate fast movements while avoiding events (like collisions or injuries) that
may hinder the collective.
Many elongate animals with reduced or no limbs also encounter solid substrates in their natural
habitats. As snakes are by far the most successful and diverse group of limbless vertebrates (121),
most modeling has focused on locomotion strategies employed by snakes (122) and have resem-
bled either the undulatory swimming models for slithering in sand or the mass-spring models of
legged locomotion. For instance, a model with a posteriorly (toward the tail) propagated wave
of lateral body curvature, matched to experimental postural data, predicted speeds that agreed
with experimental measurements from milk snakes (34). The addition of an appropriately cou-
pled vertical wave of body undulation (to represent body lifting) into the slithering model was
able to reproduce kinematics for forward locomotion (123) and turning (124) as well as predicted
displacements (35, 104) of sidewinder rattlesnakes. Mass-spring models have captured aspects of
other limbless locomotion modes, including an accordion-like body expansion and contraction
referred to as concertina (125), inch-worming-like snake gait referred to as rectilinear locomo-
tion (126), and a posteriorly propagated wave of body constrictions, referred to as peristalsis, that
is a common mode of movement in worms (127). With the exception of sidewinding, robotic mod-
els for limbless locomotors have proven far less capable than the animals that inspire them (128),
suggesting that there is a limited understanding of how animals manage and utilize environmental
interactions to generate movement.
Collective behaviors and movements can be particularly unusual and complex with long,
slender-bodied groups. For instance, thousands of small, flexible California blackworms were
observed to entangle their bodies, forming a dense blob that navigates across temperature gra-
dients as a cohesive unit (129). Close investigation revealed that the entangled entity propels itself
through a differential motion: Worms at the leading edge extend outward and pull a knotted clump
that pushes down on the underlying substrate to lift the blob and reduce friction. Other elongate
invertebrates, such as fungus gnat larvae and sawfly larvae, have also been observed to move as
a collective aggregate, though individuals have much smaller aspect ratios and therefore do not
become intertwined. Although it is not clear why these animals travel as cohesive blobs, forming
dense aggregations can protect the constituents from predation and buffer against environmental
stressors (for example, aggregating facilitates moisture retention in blackworms). These unusual
systems motivate further study under a new paradigm of “entangled active matter” (130, 131). In
the high aspect ratio limit demonstrated by worms and larvae, the long, slender individuals can be
modeled as polymer-like active filaments (131, 132), albeit in a macroscopic context with much
larger length scales than the microscopic biological and biochemical contexts under which these
filaments are commonly investigated.

(Figure 3). Though architecture, composition, complexity, and construction approaches can vary
widely—from the removal of material to create burrows to the intertwined fibers and sticks of
bird nests, to the meters-high chimneys created by termite colonies—nests often serve similar
and crucial homeostatic functions that protect inhabitants from harsh and fluctuating environ-
ments. Created by anywhere from one to millions of individuals using a diversity of behaviors,
the structures themselves also serve as indirect representations of behaviors and how they are en-
coded within an animal or animal group (for example, in insects, see Reference 137), providing
a physical example of what is referred to as an extended phenotype (138). The evolutionary history
of and the precise needs of an animal or group, along with the ambient environmental conditions
and the sizes of individuals, can affect the architecture style and placement of a structure, as well
as the medium from which it is constructed. Current experimental and modeling approaches em-
ployed to understand these systems tend to focus on some combination of: (a) the design and
mechanics of an overall structure,(b) the internal conditions within a structure,and (c) how individ-
uals that create structures perceive and manipulate the physical environment, as well as potentially
engage in interactions with fellow individuals. Although all of these features are important for
animals that build and inhabit structures, there is no universal approach that provides complete
information. Therefore, researchers tend to adopt one of a few approaches depending on the
specific system of study and the questions of interest. Within this section, we discuss a few key
approaches and how they are utilized to investigate different aspects of collective construction.

4.1. Nest Mechanics and Design
The mechanical integrity of nests can be crucial for inhabitants. For structures like bird nests (see
Figure 3a,b,g) (139–141) and beaver lodges (see Figure 3e) (142) that are composed of inanimate
materials (e.g., sticks, twigs, blades of grass, leaves, soil pellets, and other natural debris) collected
from the environment, discrete element modeling and systematic soft matter physics experiments
have been employed to probe how constituent size, shape, flexibility, and configuration affect over-
all stability and strength. For instance, studies of bird-nest-inspired jammed, flexible rods revealed
that bending stresses create a system of frictional contacts with force chains that provide enhanced
stability (compared to a system of grains or rigid rods) that birds exploit when building nests (141).
Other studies have begun to investigate how stochastic configuration and reconfiguration of con-
stituent particles may contribute to overall structural stability, strength, and form of the resulting
architecture (143, 144), as well as how this information could aid in the design of metamaterials
with desired properties (145). Understanding the interplay between and relative importance of
planned and stochastic constituent placement could provide interesting insights into how biolog-
ical systems create and maintain robust and adaptable nests, as well as crucial clues as to how such
elaborate structures can emerge from seemingly simple movements and behaviors.
4.2. Internal Nest Conditions
A diversity of animals build dwellings of varying complexity. Within these structures, internal con-
ditions such as temperature, humidity, and ventilation are often critically important for the health
of the inhabitants. Without sufficient air exchange, for instance, animals would suffocate. For rel-
atively simple burrows, PDE models for diffusion-mediated oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange
investigated the role of soil porosity, burrow size and configuration, and animal metabolism and
location within single-opening model burrows (146, 147). These studies found soil porosity and
moisture are important for gas exchange and that diffusion alone can only provide sufficient ven-
tilation to meet the needs of small (<0.5 kg) animals. A recent study (148) compiled experimental
measurements of burrow geometry and internal oxygen content for diverse animals. The authors
also expanded previous models to include convective terms and they showed that the ventilation
needs for larger animals (>1.3 kg) required more complex nest designs, such as the creation and
strategic placement of multiple openings to take advantage of environmental elements like wind
and thermal gradients to drive air exchange (148). For example, prairie dogs dig shared under-
ground burrows that are tens of meters long, are 1–5 m deep, and have two or three openings
located at burrow extremities (see Figure 3f ). PDE modeling of the fluid flow throughout the
burrow revealed that an experimentally observed elevation difference in the placement of the
openings was key for ventilation: The induced pressure differential created a directed airflow that
improved gas exchange (149).
The PDE-based gas exchange modeling approaches discussed thus far are restricted to rela-
tively simple burrow geometries. However, laboratory experiments and field observations have
revealed that many animals and groups of animals create much more complex structures (see
Figure 3 for several examples). How these nests are created and adapted to maintain desired in-
ternal conditions is largely unknown, though the arrangement and complexity of burrows within
the nests of some species have been observed to vary with substrate properties as well as en-
vironmental conditions. For instance, the small desert-dwelling rodent, Sundevall’s jird, creates
burrows that are able to maintain microclimates that are considerably different from the ambient
environment (Figure 3d), and experimental measurements revealed that the complexity and mor-
phology of these burrows vary with soil cohesion (134, 150). Similar morphological variation in
nests has been observed based on ambient environmental conditions. The Argus monitor lizard,
340
Riiska et al.

which inhabits Western Australia’s wet–dry tropical savanna, digs a roughly 3-m-deep helical bur-
row (Figure 3c), possibly to prevent desiccation of incubating eggs during the dry season (133).
The sand monitor lizard, a desert-dwelling relative of the Argus monitor lizard, digs deeper bur-
rows, which may be needed to achieve similar levels of protection against dry conditions (151).
Invertebrate nests such as those built by harvester ants (see Figure 3j) have also been shown to
vary with soil conditions; for instance, laboratory experiments revealed that they excavate large,
interconnected networks of tunnels only in moist sand or silt with low-to-medium water satura-
tion (152). Similarly, the depth of an incipient fire ant tunnel was found to be positively correlated
with the substrate strength (153).
Large colonies of social insects, such as some ant and termite species, can build meters-tall
above-ground (136, 154) (or meters-deep subterranean; 155, 156) nests that can house millions
of individuals. Though nest ventilation must be crucial for the survival of inhabitants, scientific
exploration of the relationships between the diverse structures and the internal environmental
conditions of such large nests has only just begun. Although the desired internal nest conditions
are often unknown, leafcutter ants (Figure 3k) (155) and some species of termites (Figure 3l)
(e.g., 136) require microclimates that facilitate the growth of a fungus that they cultivate (and
which serves as their only food source) inside their nests using natural debris collected from the
local environment. Termite nests, created through a mixture of soil, clay, and their own bodily
secretions, have been more thoroughly explored. In particular, the species Odontotermes obesus
and Macrotermes michaelseni leverage ambient temperature oscillations for ventilation (136, 157).
Heat exposure during the day induces an internal circulation of airflow (upward near the edges,
downward in the center) that flushes excess CO2 from the meters-high mound. During the cooler
nighttime temperatures, this direction of flow is reversed. Simple scaling relationships revealed
how different mound morphologies can arise as a result of the flow of heat, air, and odor (158).
Heat and airflow within these mounds was modeled via the advection–diffusion equation (158).
Model predictions, which suggest that mound size is positively correlated with larger daily tem-
perature oscillations, are consistent with observations that the tall mounds of M. michaelseni are
found in the semiarid environments of the African savanna, which has large temperature oscil-
lations, whereas the much smaller mounds of O. obesus are found in Asian forests, where shade
buffers temperature changes. Similar variation was observed in the nests of Macrotermes bellicosus
termites, who live in both the warm savanna and cool forests; more complex mounds were found
in the savanna, with a high surface area that enabled the creation of a convection cell (159). Mean-
while, forest mounds were simpler, thick-walled domes, which provided better insulation from
cooler temperatures at the expense of reduced ventilation.
4.3. Coordination in Construction
How the elaborate nests of large social insect colonies emerge from the coordinated efforts of
seemingly identical individuals is not fully understood. Grassé (160) introduced the concept of
stigmergy, which describes how decentralized collective construction can emerge through indi-
rect communication. When an individual modifies its environment in response to a stimulus, such
as the removal or deposition of material, the resulting environmental changes produce new stim-
uli that can induce subsequent responses. Originally formulated in the context of social insects,
stigmergy can be applied to other systems, including humans and even nonliving systems (161),
though the extent to which the coordination of noninsect systems is stigmergic is often not known.
For insects, gradients of chemical and physical environmental quantities, or in the flow and den-
sity of nestmates, may also serve as regulatory mechanisms in collective construction, as they can
encode indirect information regarding the state of the colony and act as building cues (162, 163).

Agent-based models provide a general approach to test how simple and local behavioral rules
can result in the creation of large structures and can be implemented when continuum models
become intractable or continuum descriptions are not appropriate. These models treat individ-
uals as “agents” that obey simple, local rules of movement and interaction (with each other and
sometimes environmental elements) (164–168). Global dynamics and structures emerge from the
cumulative effects of local interactions.For instance,a model for ant nest construction,that treated
the collection and deposition of each particle as a pheromone-mediated Markovian decision pro-
cess, was able to reproduce similar building dynamics and spatial patterns of nests as observed
in experiments (169). Additionally, highly interconnected nests can be modeled as structural net-
works (165–167),with topological properties that can be related to behavior.For example,the level
of recruitment to food in harvester ants depends on the network topology of the nest, namely the
redundancy of connections, but not its morphology (166). Finally, though functional relationships
are often derived empirically from agent-based models, these models can and have inspired the
development of theoretical models (e.g., 170) through the identification of key symmetries, scaling
laws, and phenomenological results.
4.4. Self-Assemblies
Some invertebrate species have adapted to manage harsh environmental conditions through
the creation of temporary self-assemblies (20, 171), such as bridges, rafts, towers, and bivouacs
(Figure 4). The morphology, geometry, and lifetime of many of these self-assemblies are often
strongly influenced by the surrounding environment, with the constituent insects being able to dy-
namically adapt the structure. These aggregations, created via interlocking limbs, are distinct from
nonliving materials: They can locally and reversibly alter the orientation, the extended length, and
the attachment locations of individual limbs and, as a result, control the local density, the support
network, and the load distribution within an aggregation (171). Mechanical models provide infor-
mation about the mechanical response properties of aggregates, and agent-based models are used
to explore how behavioral rules based on local information give rise to and affect global struc-
tures and dynamics. Many models describing self-assemblies incorporate both mechanical and

agent-based elements. In the remainder of this section, we discuss a few examples of structures
that serve important functions and persist on different timescales.
Experimental soft matter studies found that fire ant aggregations behave viscoelastically and
have a density-dependent rheology, with higher elastic modulus and stiffness measured for higher
densities (172), which could enable individuals to tune mechanical properties of the aggregate
based on environmental conditions. More recent follow-up experiments observed the propagation
of density waves during the relaxation of a compacted, dense aggregation of fire ants to a less dense
state (173). An agent-based model revealed that local density, activity, and orientational alignment
contribute to these spontaneously generated waves and that the control of local activity, which is
unique to living systems, may be a crucial component for understanding how living self assemblies
adapt to complex external environments.
More naturalistic experimental studies of insect species that build temporary structures have
provided insights into how changes in individual behaviors may give rise to a collective response
to environmental fluctuations and perturbations to meet their needs. For example, army ants
construct temporary bridges to facilitate the colony’s foraging expeditions upon the forest floor
(Figure 4a). The ants collectively overcome obstacles by linking their bodies to form bridges
across holes and gaps up to tens of times wider than an ant, and they can dynamically vary the
position and morphology of the bridge as needed in response to the traffic flow and the envi-
ronment (174). An agent-based model in which the traffic dynamics on the bridge influence the
likelihood for ants to enter or leave the structure revealed that bridges are robust to small fluctua-
tions in traffic but are highly responsive to large interruptions (175). As another example, fire ants
construct towers that serve as temporary shelters following floods (Figure 4b). These towers con-
tinuously sink and are constantly rebuilt: interior ants sink and exit through tunnels at the bottom
before climbing back onto the surface. Here, the dynamics of the shape of the tower were mod-
eled using an agent-based approach with simple behavioral rules where ants randomly move on
the tower surface before encountering an available space suitable for joining the structure (176).
This same species can also construct wide, shallow rafts (Figure 4d) that float on water for up to a
month, allowing the ants to sail across flooded areas in search of new nest sites. When rafts expe-
rienced mechanical perturbations, ants contracted their muscles to increase their density, thereby
increasing raft stability (but decreasing buoyancy) (46).
Honeybees also exhibit interesting collective dynamics, forming robust swarm clusters that
consist of thousands of individuals,which can hang onto tree branches for several days while scouts
search for new nesting sites (Figure 4c). Remarkably, these clusters are able to dynamically adapt
their shape to remain stable when exposed to environmental stressors such as rain, mechanical
perturbations, and ambient temperature oscillations. When a cluster is shaken, for example, by
wind, bees adjust their positions to form a flattened cluster shape that has higher stability (168).
This morphological change is accomplished without central control, with each individual acting
only in response to local cues; an agent-based model predicts that individual bees sense the local
strain gradient and move to regions of higher strain, resulting in collective stabilization (168).
Similarly, clusters use local interactions to globally thermoregulate via shape changes, expanding
the cluster when ambient temperatures rise and contracting when temperatures fall (177).
5. DISCUSSION AND OPEN QUESTIONS
Biological systems are fundamentally different from nonliving systems in that they possess inher-
ent functionalities that operate across multiple length and timescales and that have been refined
through evolutionary processes. A general understanding of animal behavior requires information
about functionality and intention in the context of an organism or group of organisms, as well as
their evolutionary history and the environmental conditions they face. In this article, we focused

on the state of the field for a few broadly relevant topics that are crucial for animal survival: the
complex and diverse small-scale textures present on biological exteriors and what is known about
their macroscopic consequences; how movement strategies and body morphologies depend on
environmental physics, as well as the modeling techniques used to describe and, to some extent,
understand locomotion in steady-state environments; and how environmental substrates are ma-
nipulated to construct nests, and these structures depend on the ambient conditions, the needs of
the individual or group, and the size of the individuals. Here, we discuss some interesting open
questions within each of these topics, as well as what is known about connections between these
topics, and where further study could elucidate a deeper understanding of the physics and biology
underlying the behaviors of individuals and collectives.
Interestingly, the hierarchical microscopic structural features and textures that produce the di-
verse macroscopic phenomena discussed in Section 2 occur at similar or even overlapping length
scales, suggesting possible multifunctionality of these features. The diversity of textures, which
are constrained by the evolutionary history of the organism, demonstrates the fascinating and
vast solution space for a particular function or set of functions. The possibility for other func-
tionalities exists as well, though potential multifunctionalities have not been thoroughly explored.
For instance, a recent study demonstrated that moth wings act as acoustic metamaterials that
are remarkably good at absorbing sound waves, thereby obscuring their location to bats using
echolocation to hunt (178). Presumably other sound dampening structures exist, as well as sound-
producing structures, though these functions have not been broadly investigated. Though we have
presented a variety of structures and discussed macroscopic consequences, this is only a small sub-
set of the diversity of structures that exist, many of which have yet to be explored. Even among the
ones that have been studied, they are not typically investigated in vivo. As a result, the degree to
which an organism can dynamically change or control its microtextures, as well as the macroscopic
implications of tunability, is largely unknown for living systems. However, the macroscopic effects
of dynamical or differential surface features have been explored in nonliving systems. For instance,
differences in heat absorption can lead to surface tension gradients that drive fluid flows (37), and
flexible substrates can be deformed by the surface tension of interacting water drops (36), thereby
potentially leading to changes in coloration,adhesion,or other physical properties.Also,the extent
to which animals can actively control or vary these features is unknown in many systems, though
there may be benefits associated with such abilities. Finally, there have been some observations of
order versus disorder in these structures at different length scales (52), though the role of disorder
is not fully understood. It would be interesting to develop an understanding of how animals may
dynamically exploit these textures, as well as relate the diversity of solutions to intended functions
that are constrained by an animal’s evolutionary history.
Microstructures can also be important for movements (discussed in Section 3), which are es-
sential for the well-being of many animals and collectives. The underlying motivations are key
to understanding observed animal behaviors, and different motivations can lead to very different
behaviors. For instance, prey pursuit can be fast, stealthy, or even coordinated; predator aversion
can elicit dramatic and fast responses. In contrast, movements over longer timescales, such as sea-
sonal migration, likely need to be energy efficient. Hunting and foraging strategies and behaviors
can vary throughout the process: For instance, initial approaches may explore an environment
more thoroughly and broadly before establishing a more directed or reinforced path. Mating dis-
plays in diverse animals such as spiders, birds, and flies often rely on precise timing and push the
physical limits of performance. Strategies for achieving specific goals of a movement are depen-
dent upon—and complicated by—the physics of complex, heterogeneous environments. A few
studies across length scales have highlighted the importance of microscopic features for move-
ment (e.g., 5, 19, 35, 179), though much more remains to be explored. In particular, given the
344
Riiska et al.

diversity of movement-related behaviors and the large separation of size and timescales, compu-
tational modeling with systematic parameter variation can be challenging. Simple mathematical
models have provided some insights for individual movements; however, a key assumption of these
models is that individuals are immersed in a fully developed, steady-state flow. This assumption
often breaks down for dense collectives, which can leverage environmental disturbances induced
by their neighbors for their benefit. Although there are models that investigate how individuals
in a group sense and coordinate movements with neighbors (e.g., 164), the complex, time-varying
environmental interactions are outside the scope of these models, and there is a need for a theo-
retical description that incorporates environment-mediated interactions. Physical models can and
have been helpful for studying individual and collective dynamics in complex environments; how-
ever, a major challenge is creating robots whose mechanical properties are similar to biological
systems. The field of soft robotics (180) is rapidly growing, and as these models improve, they may
provide unique opportunities to explore new ideas related to animal movements and interactions
at both the individual and collective scales. In addition, these models will facilitate exploration of
the macroscopic consequences of small surface textures and features, which can be challenging to
accurately represent in computational models.
In addition to movement, both individuals and collectives manipulate environmental material
to form functional constructions (as discussed in Section 4). Structures can be created for a va-
riety of reasons, with the specifics dependent upon the details of the structure and the needs of
its inhabitants. Here, we focused on crucial structures that serve essential homeostatic functions
like thermoregulation and ensuring adequate ventilation. Even with these restrictions, animals
create a diversity of shelters and nests out of a variety of environmental materials. How harsh and
fluctuating environments are managed while mechanical stability is maintained has not been thor-
oughly explored across systems. As many of the substrates these animals interact with are soft and
deformable materials, a theoretical understanding of these structures and their functions could
potentially provide insights into the physics of soft, configurable, and potentially reconfigurable
materials. Specifically, many of these structures are adapted or repaired in response to environ-
mental perturbations, and how this process unfolds to maintain internal conditions, structural
stability, and other functionalities required to protect inhabitants depends on substrate physics,
which is largely unexplored.
More broadly, an important aspect of studying animal behavior is how ambient conditions can
influence observed behaviors. For example, long-range correlations observed in the dynamics of
individuals in wild midge swarms (181, 182) were not observed in laboratory swarms (183). More
recent work revealed that adding external environmental perturbations to the laboratory swarms
could reproduce these correlations, indicating that the study of behavior should not be decou-
pled from environmental context and highlighting the crucial role of experiments in a natural
context (184). Fortunately, the development of deep-learning-based tracking tools (3) has made
extracting information from images taken in more natural settings much more feasible and ro-
bust. Modeling approaches commonly applied to understand such data are agent-based, which
have contributed to an understanding of collective dynamics and can be powerful tools for testing
hypotheses about the emergent aspects of simple local rules; however, they typically lack predic-
tive power and can fail to isolate crucial components driving emergent observations. For example,
multiple agent-based models with different behavioral rules were shown to reproduce similar dy-
namics at the collective level while matching with experimental data (185). As a result, there is a
need for predictive models to understand the drivers of collective behaviors and for experimental
data that can aid in the development of such predictive models.
Finally, we close by mentioning a few other interesting areas to be explored. First, animals
are frequently required to transition between behaviors and environments. Some previous work
www.annualreviews.org • Physics of Animal Behavior
345

investigated how salamanders manage a swimming-to-walking transition (186), but many other
transitions have not been explored, for instance, how individuals or collectives transition from
flying to landing, and for collectives, how movements and transitions of dense groups, such as the
creation or dissolution of a bee bivouac or an ant raft, are coordinated. Second, there are many
open questions surrounding how environmental physics may operate at evolutionary timescales
and drive morphological changes, e.g., the development of limbs from fins, during critical transi-
tions such as the vertebrate invasion of land (187).Third,some work has made progress attempting
to infer behavioral changes at evolutionary timescales from fossil records, though much remains
unknown. Studies of this sort have used experimental data from living animals in conjunction
with preserved fossilized footprints to understand how dinosaurs moved (188). Along similar lines,
other investigations range from preserved burrows (189) that have related nest features, such as
overall size, depth, and extent, as well as internal markings, presumably made by animals during
the excavation process, to animal morphology and morphological adaptations in the face of chang-
ing and fluctuating environmental conditions. Further investigations of the many facets of animal
behaviors from a physics perspective will contribute new and exciting insights into evolutionary
and organismal biology, as well as aid in the discovery of new physical laws for behavior that nature
has figured out but that we have yet to uncover or fully understand.
