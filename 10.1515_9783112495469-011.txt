Some Remarks on the Random Field Ising Model

It is suggested that domain wall roughening due to random fields in Ising-like systems is different 
for lattice and continuum models. It is shown quite generally, that this is incorrect for dimensions 
d <J 3; on a sufficiently large scale the scale dependence of the wall roughness and the interface 
tension are identical for both types of models. This may have consequences for metastability and 
hysteresis effects. 
Es ist vorgeschlagen worden, daß die Domänenwandrauhigkeit 
infolge von Zufallsfeldern in 
Ising-ähnlichen Systemen für Gitter- und Kontinuumsmodelle unterschiedlich ist. Es wird 
ganz allgemein gezeigt, daß dies für Dimensionen d 
3 inkorrekt ist: auf einer genügend großen 
Skala sind die Abhängigkeiten der Wandrauhigkeit und der Grenzflächendehnung für beide 
Modellarten identisch. Dies kann Folgen für die Metastabilitäts- und Hystereseeffekte haben. 
1. Introduction 
The "stricto sensu" random field Ising model (RFIM) is defined by the Hamiltonian 
H = 
+ 
= 
- 
i J J 
S i S j - 
2 H t S i 
(1.1) 
<i,i> 
i 
with St = +1, i and j denote sites of a simple cubic lattice of spacing a = 1. Hi is 
a random field (RF) with 
[Hi]av 
= 0 , 
[//,//,]av = 
, 
(1.2) 
where [...]av denotes the configurational average. Throughout the paper II 
J will 
be assumed. 
For over one decade there has been a controversial debate about the influence of 
the RF on the behaviour of this model at low temperatures, in particular about its 
lower critical dimension dx [1 to 15], Universality suggests that the properties of the 
"stricto sensu" RFIM should be shared by other RF models with a single component 
order parameter. The consideration of domain boundaries to study a possible insta-
bility of the ordered state turned out to be a fruitful concept in this matter. Previous 
analysis, however, suggested a different behaviour of systems with narrow and broad 
domain walls, respectively. This difference concerns in particular the large scale 
domain wall roughening. Narrow wall systems should be well modelled by (1.1). On 
the other hand, one would expect that under certain conditions (e.g. that we are above 
the roughening transition T^H)), wall roughening exhibits universal properties, 
provided we are on a sufficiently large length scale (say large compared with some 
mesoscopic scale A^>a). 
On a mesoscopic scale, walls are described by an interface tension, a{n, A) [18], 
The dependence of a on the direction n of the wall normal reflects the underlying

lattice structure. In some cases, the behaviour of a{n, A) in the neighbourhood of 
certain directions (say n = z) can be specified by a(z, A) = a0 and the wall stiffness 
r(z, A) = r (see Section 2). Since the definition of a{n, A) includes the integration 
over short wavelength fluctuations [18] (wavelength smaller than A), a(n, A) depends 
in general on those parameters, defining the microscopic model (e.g. on J, H and the 
temperature T if applied to (1.1)). Unfortunately, the symbol J has been often used 
for denoting cr0 or r , which caused some confusion when results of other authors were 
referred to [17], 
As mentioned already most of the authors obtained different behaviour of the large 
scale interface properties for the narrow and broad wall case, [4], [7], [11], [15], [16], 
respectively. Contrary to these findings the present authors has claimed that for 
dimensionalities d 
3 the large scale properties are identical for both cases, if the 
proper relations between the microscopic and mesoscopic parameters are used [13], 
[19]. With the present paper, we hope to clarify the weak point in the "conventional" 
treatment of the narrow wall case. 
2. Interface Phenomenology 
We summarize briefly some properties of the interface tension a(n, A). Detailed infor-
mation and a comprehensive list of references on anisotropic surface tensions can be 
found in the review of Zia [18], 
The interface tension a(n, o) is defined as the difference of two bulk free energies, 
with antiperiodic and periodic boundary conditions, respectively, which specify an 
interface with mean normal n and linear extension o. Usually, o -> oo in this definition, 
but for 
dx the g-dependence of a is assumed to be weak on a scale q ^>A (which 
may be considered as a definition of A). Thus, it makes sense to consider a{n, A), 
where A is assumed to be fixed. 
The energy of the interface is then given by 
Ha = / ds a{n, A) , 
(2.1) 
where ds denotes the (d — l)-dimensional surface element. In general, a(n) has ex-
trema in certain directions n0. To be specific, let us assume w0= z. For small interface 
deviations f(r) from the plane xd = z = 0, where r = 
... , Zd-i} denotes the posi-
tion vector on this plane, we have

dx2 ' "' ' 
dxa 
vg 
9f\* 
( 0/ 
(2-2) 
ds = dd^r \/g . 
If the interface with normal z is rough, i.e. its mean square distortion w2(q) = [</2>]av 
diverges with its linear extension p, a(n) is analytic at n = z (see [18], [21] and refer-
ences cited therein). Assuming this roughness on the scale A, we may expand a{n, A) 
in (2.1) around n = z. This yields 
Ha =

p

(2.4) 
and where we have chosen x1 ... xd__, to be the principal axis of the tensor 82o'/ÖMiÖ'fti. 
For a stable interface A > 0. Below we assume all Ft to be equal. Clearly, for an 
isotropic system cr0 = F. 
On the contrary, if the interface with normal z is smooth, 
a(n, A) has a cusp at 
fi = z, i.e. it is non-analytic. 
The magnitude of this cusp in the ¡^-direction is related 
to the free energy per unit length FSii of a macroscopic 
step normal to the ¡»-direction 
of height a ( = 1) [18], This step free energy is defined by considering an interface of 
width gd~2 transverse to the it-direction with one edge at Xi = 0 pinned at / = 0, 
and the other edge at Xi = q pinned at / = a ( = 1). In terms of the free energy F(a, q), 
of this interface, the step free energy is given by FSti = lim Xi(p) a with 
Me) = -Ö ¿ 2 {F(a, (?) + F( — a, g) - 2^(0, e)} . 
(2.5) 
¿tQ Qj 
H„ 
Let us again assume that Xi(q) is essentially ^-independent for g ^ A (which could be 
also considered as a restriction for A). The interface energy can then be approximated 
as 
j 
{<70 + s W ) 
+ 0((V/) 2)|, 
(2.6) 
Again, all Xt{A) will be assumed to be equal for simplicity. Note that interface distor-
tions are described by quite different energy expressions 8Ha = II a — cr0 / d d _ 1r in 
the case of rough and smooth walls, respectively. 
3. Domain Well Roughening 
In order to describe the case of narrow walls, one usually considers a modified SOS 
Hamiltonian for the interface [7]

z = sign /(») 
where a lattice site i is now labeled by its projection i on and its distance /(/) (integer) 
from the z = 0 plane. (3.1) follows from (1.1) if one neglects overhang configurations. 
Considering interface roughening for this model, an interface distortion w is accom-
panied by an increase SEa of elastic energy and a field energy gain ?>E ¡¡. The standard 
expressions for T = 0 are [2], [4], [7], [15], [16]

(3-5) 
In deriving (3.4) for d —> 3, contributions from all scales q ... 1 have to be considered. 
According to (3.4) for d 
3 interfaces are rough, but the ^-dependence of w and 8Ez 
deviates strongly from that found for broad walls (see (3.7), (3.8)). 
We show that this is not the case, (3.2), (3.4), and (3.5) apply only on scales q <C I 
with w(l) ^ 1. The crucial expression is SEa, (3.2), which has the form arising from 
a finite step free energy (compare (2.6)) with x — J. However, since according to 
(3.4) the interface gets rough for q 
I and d 
3, the surface tension becomes analytic 
and the step free energy should vanish on this scale — in contradiction to the assump-
tion (3.2). Thus, we conclude that the ansatz (3.2) for 8Ea becomes wrong for q 
I 
with I ~ {JIHfW-V (i.e. I ~ (J/H)2 for d = 2 and I ~ exp C{JjHf 
for d = 3 and 
T = 0 [13]). On scales q ;> I, 8Ea has to replaced by Er (compare (2.3)), 
which is the elastic energy for broad walls. 8E n is still given by (3.3). Minimization 
yields now

For d = 2 all scales give contributions of equal order. Hence 
where c is a constant of order unity. (3.7) to (3.10) apply at low T to broad walls for 
2 iS d <[ 5 and to narrow walls for 2

includes more steps than configuration 1 a, its energy 8Ea is lower due to R F energy 
gains on smaller scales.

For d = 2 E3 — Er since w/q — const for q —» oo. For d > 3, the dominant contri-
butions to w(q) (3.4) in the narrow wall case come from small scales q ^ a = 1. Thus, 
H has to be larger than a threshold value 
— J to get w(q) ^ 1, i.e. we expect the 
existence of a roughening transition as a function of the random field strength [13]. 
4. Correlation Length 
Imry and Ma [1] considered the stability of the ferromagnetic state of the R F I M 
against the formation of an antiphase droplet of volume Rd. The energy e(R) R'1 for 
such a droplet is given by 
e{R) 
Rd = a(R) 
R'1^1 
- 
MHR
d>2 
In 1' 2 R , 
(4.1) 
where M = (Si) and <...) denotes the thermal average. a(R) = a(n, R) is the appro-
priate directional average of the surface tension. Since we want to include the cases 
d fSidl 
we allow for a scale-dependent a. With the ansatz 
o(R) R 1 1- 1 ~ iJrf-i+s« 
(4.2) 
one finds negative droplet energies for large R if d 
dl = 2 ( 1 — 
x(d])'). 
For an arbitrary 
ramified droplet one could expect 1 ]> x 
0 and hence dt 
2. 
However, for a thermodynamically stable state ramification will lower the energy 
and therefore possibly x < 0 or dl > 2 (e.g. for continuous walls x = 
— 1, i.e. dt = 4). 
For compact droplets x = 0, d] = 2 and, neglecting 
the R dependence of a, one 
finds for the mean droplet 
size £ (which we identify with the correlation length) in two 
dimensions 
Rc~ 
e x p i ^ j . 
(4.3) 
For T = 0, a = cJ, M = 1 whereas for T > 0, Morgenstern, Binder and Hornreich 
[20] used M = M(T, H = 0) and a = ca(z, A — oo, T, H = 0) from the pure n.n. 
Ising model, c is a numerical factor. 
Since the result d{ = 2 contradicts findings from perturbation theory [14] which 
gave dt = 3, some authors claimed, that interface roughening could lead to x 
0 [9]. 
A value x(d 
3) = - 
^ would indeed reconcile both theories. However, as shown in 
Section 3, there is no independence of a due to the random field for d > 2, thus dl = 2 
remains unchanged. But wall roughening may drastically reduce the correlation 
length for d 
2. Indeed, substituting in (4.1) a(R) by o(o = R) from (3.10) and look-

For an isotropic system r = a0, i.e. y 
1 for H —» 0 and (4.5) agrees with the result 
of Villain [15]. Note, however, that (4.5) is in disagreement with the finding £ ~ R c 
of Grant and Gunton [17]. This discrepancy seems to be due to an inadequacy of 
their treatment to take into account energy gains due to wall roughening. Since 
f 
R e for y^> 1 wall roughening destabilizes the ordered state (in equilibrium), but 
only for d ^ dl =2. 
For narrow walls, we get with a0 «s J, J 1— J(JjH)2 
(T = 0) 
y as 1. Thus f — ec(J/H)2 as from bulk consideration (see (4.3)). At non-zero tempera-
tures, where r remains finite for H -» 0, y

Above dh wall roughening due to random fields produces metastability [15], [16], 
[22], [23]. The barrier between metastable states is identified with SE^q). Since for 
narrow walls and q 
1 (3.8) should be used instead of (3.5) (but with F given in 
(3.11)), previous results for narrow walls [15], [16] should not be applicable. However, 
on short time scales, where barriers cannot be crossed by thermal hopping, the cor-
relation length of the metastable state is given by the equilibrium between the driving 
force per unit area <x/£ due to the surface tension and the pinning force Ec [22], Since 
the largest pinning forces result from the smallest scales q ~ 1, it is the same to use 
(3.5) or (3.8) [23], On larger time scales barriers can be crossed and the characteristic 
times ip for this process are indeed different, depending on whether one uses SE^q) 
(3.5) or (3.8) in the Arrhenius law. However, calculating effective (time dependent) 
pinning forces and thence 
these differences cancel again and one obtains both from 
(3.4), (3.5) and (3.7), (3.8) the same results [23].

The above considerations apply to interface roughening close to the infrared stable fixed point 
H = T = 0, i.e. inside the ordered phase. For d ^ d\ = 2 this fixed point becomes infrared un-
stable. We expect therefore a breakdown of (3.11) and (4.3) d<L 2 and sufficiently small H. In 
this region r should depend non-criticallv on H whereas £ is given by (4.5).

Voltage generation in strong magnetic fields (0 to 6 T) in HgTe and n-InSb under far-infrared 
illumination is observed. The fine structure of the observed voltage versus the magnetic field is 
interpreted as being due to transitions between Landau sublevels. A new method of experimental 
determination of the nature of the observed voltage is presented. It is shown that for both the 
materials investigated, the observed phenomenon is due to the optically-induced Nernst-Etting-
hausen effect. From the qualitative analysis it is concluded that at low temperatures and in 
quantisizing magnetic fields, the phonon drag is the main process responsible for the observed 
voltage in both, InSb and HgTe. 
Es wird das Auftreten einer Spannung in HgTe und n-InSb unter Bestrahlung im fernen Infrarot 
in starken Magnetfeldern (0 bis 6 T) beobachtet. Die Feinstruktur der beobachteten Spannung in 
Abhängigkeit vom Magnetfeld wird durch Übergänge zwischen Landau-Subniveaus erklärt. Eine 
neue Methode der experimentellen Bestimmung der Natur der beobachteten Spannung wird vor-
geschlagen. Es wird gezeigt, daß für beide untersuchten Materialien das beobachtete Phänomen 
durch den optisch induzierten Nernst-Ettinghausen-Effekt hervorgerufen wird. Die qualitative 
Analyse führt zu dem Schluß, daß bei niedrigen Temperaturen und in quantisierenden Magnet-
feldern der Phononen-Drageffekt der für die beobachtete Spannung in InSb und HgTe haupt-
sächlich verantwortliche Prozeß ist. 
1. Introduction 
If a semiconductor or a semimetal sample is placed in a constant magnetic field B 
and illuminated with radiation with photon energy hw = hojc <C. Eg (Eg energy gap, 
coc cyclotron frequency) a constant voltage can be observed in the direction per-
pendicular to B and to the wave vector of the incident radiation. 
If the sign of the generated voltage changes when the direction of the magnetic 
field B is reversed, there can be only two possible explanations of the phenomenon: 
the Nernst-Ettinghausen effect (N-E) or the photoelectromagnetic effect (PEM). 
A typical geometry of such an experiment is shown in Fig. 1. There have been several 
observations of such effects in semiconductors and semimetals. Morimoto et al. [1] 
have observed such a voltage in bismuth and interpreted the results obtained as 
being due to the PEM. Their principal argument for this interpretation was the 
very rapid increase of the observed signal (the pulse technique was used). Von Orten-
berg [2] has observed a similar phenomenon in tellurium. He interpreted his results
