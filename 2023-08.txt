Active fluids, such as cytoskeletal filaments, bacterial colonies and epithelial 
cell layers, exhibit distinctive orientational coherence, often characterized 
by nematic order and its breakdown, defined by the presence of topological 
defects. In contrast, little is known about positional coherence, that is, whether 
there is an organization in the underlying fluid motion—despite this being both 
a prominent and an experimentally accessible feature. Here we characterize the 
organization of fluid motion in active nematics using the notion of Lagrangian 
coherent structures by analyzing experimental data of two-dimensional 
mixtures of microtubules and kinesin, as well as numerical data obtained from 
the simulation of the active nematodynamic equations. Coherent structures 
consist of moving attractors and repellers, which orchestrate complex motion. 
To understand the interaction of positional and orientational coherence, we 
analyse experiments and simulations and find that +1/2 defects move and 
deform the attractors, functioning as control centres for collective motion. 
Additionally, we find that regions around isolated +1/2 defects undergo high 
bending and low stretching/shearing deformations, consistent with the local 
stress distribution. The stress is the minimum at the defect, whereas high 
differential stress along the defect orientation induces folding. Our work offers 
a new perspective to describe and control self-organization in active fluids, 
with potential applications to multicellular systems.
Many out-of-equilibrium systems, from bird flocks down to biofilms 
and the cell cytoskeleton, consist of agents that consume energy and 
self-organize into large-scale patterns and collectively moving struc-
tures1–9, which are breathtaking in their beauty and complexity and 
relevant for embryonic development, wound healing and cancer10–13. 
Understanding the mechanisms that lead to these patterns and charac­
terizing the phases of active matter systems will unravel their com-
plexity, suggesting ways to mimic them using synthetic materials and 
eventually control and design active systems using external fields.
Self-organized patterns are typically described in Eulerian  
coordinates, where the local velocity, pressure and orientation of the 
active building blocks are treated as fields within a fixed laboratory 
frame. Two-point correlation functions, spectral densities and other 
quantities inspired by studies of statistical steady states of turbulence 
in Newtonian fluids, are typical outcomes of this approach14,15. Topo-
logical defects, that is, localized singularities in the orientation of the 
active building blocks2, have also been extensively studied and their 
dynamics are known to be inherently entangled with large-scale chaotic 
flows15–17. But what is the relation between the dynamics of defects and 
the large-scale coherent motion in flow fields that are typically spatially 
heterogeneous and temporally unsteady?
A natural framework to address this question is provided by the 
Lagrangian description of fluid flow. By tracing the motion of passive 
particles in unsteady flows, which may also include chaotic paths,

(Fig. 1), so that
κt

(5)
Large values of κt
t0(x0, ξ2) mark the initial positions x0 of the nematic 
fluid that will undergo large folding in the time interval [t0, t], and 
similarly, κt
t0(xt, ξ2) identifies the final positions of the nematic fluid 
that experience small/large curvature changes (in the Supplementary 
Section 1, we provide general expressions for the material curvature 
and its alternative formulation in terms of Eulerian quantities such  
as flow vorticity, divergence and rate-of-strain tensor). Altogether, 
equations (3)–(5) completely quantify the maximum stretching  
and folding deformations of a continuum moving under a given  
flow map Ft
t0. These kinematic measures are model independent and 
agnostic to the mechanisms driving the flow; hence they are applicable 
to experimental and computational velocity fields of arbitary origin 
and are readily implementable.
In terms of these measures, we can interpret the forward FTLE 
(fw FTLE or fΛ) as a scalar field over the initial particle positions x0  
that quantifies the maximum local deformation and identifies the 
location of maximum spatial separation of initially close particles 
over the time interval [t0, t]. Similarly, the backward FTLE (bw FTLE  
or bΛ), defined over the final positions xt, identifies the location of  
the maximum spatial convergence of initially distant particles over 
[t0, t]. Together, they demarcate regions of attraction (attracting 
CS) and repulsion (repelling CS) (Fig. 1). Despite the fact that FTLE 
ridges are rarely not material18, here we adopt FTLE-based CSs, instead  
of geodesic ones18,19, because we are interested in attraction and  
repulsion due to both shear and normal deformations, and FTLE CSs 
are simpler than geodesic CSs to compute and analyse.
CSs organize particle motion
We now employ these analytical tools to analyse experimental obser-
vations of two-dimensional microtubule-based active nematic liquid 
crystals assembled on a surfactant-stabilized oil–water interface27.  
one can often identify robust skeletons, commonly referred to as  
coherent structures (CSs)18–20, which shape the trajectory patterns 
and reveal the organizing barriers to material transport21,22. Because 
we expect our results to hold regardless of the specific Lagrangian 
integration time, we will often use CSs, which include Lagrangian CSs18 
and their recently developed short-time limits19,23. Here we combine 
theoretical concepts from nonlinear dynamics, active nematodynam-
ics simulations and experiments on suspensions of microtubules and  
kinesin to unravel the CSs underlying the chaotic flow of two- 
dimensional active nematics and their relation to the dynamics of 
topological defects.
Results
Lagrangian deformations and CSs
Our theoretical and computational framework for kinematic analysis 
starts by considering the velocity field v(x, t) of a planar active nematic 
fluid, and the corresponding flow map
Ft
t0(x0) = x0 + ∫
t
t0
v(Fτ
t0(x0), τ) dτ .
(1)
This evolves the initial position x0 of a virtual tracer particle to the 
corresponding position Ft
t0(x0) at time t, and its spatial derivatives 
describe the Lagrangian deformation of the nematic fluid over the  
time interval [t0, t]. Locally, a small fluid patch can be stretched, sheared 
and folded. Stretching and shearing (Fig. 1) are completely characte­
rized by the right Cauchy–Green strain tensor field Ct
t0(x0) (ref. 24) 
defined as
Ct
t0(x0) = ∇∇∇Ft
t0(x0)
⊤∇∇∇Ft
t0(x0) ,
(2)
where ∇∇∇Ft
t0(x0) is the Jacobian of the flow map.
Given a material patch consisting of straight fibres at initial time 
(Fig. 1), we use the notation λ1 ≤ λ2 and {ξ1, ξ2} to denote the eigenvalues 
and the associated orthonormal eigenvectors of Ct
t0(x0). Then one  
can interpret ξ2 as the most stretched fibre (by a factor √λ2) and  
ξ1 is the least stretched one (by a factor √λ1). In chaotic systems,  
λ2 usually grows exponentially in time, it is typically rescaled to read 
Λt
t0(x0) =
1
|t −t0| log √λ2(x0),
(3)
which denotes the largest finite-time Lyapunov exponent (FTLE). The 
maximum stretching along ξ2 implies that over long times, other fibres 
align with the local ξ2 direction (Fig. 1), and follows from an asymptotic 
analysis of the underlying dynamical system25.
By contrast, folding deformations determine variations in the 
curvature of material fibres over time26. This effect can be computed 
from the second-order spatial derivatives of Ft
t0(x0) and provides 
additional information that complements notions of stretching and  
shearing characterized by first-order spatial derivatives. Starting  
with an infinitesimal patch of straight fibres at x0, from the ξ2-alignment 
property it follows that the most likely observable fluid folding,  
during the time interval [t0, t], is the one along the ξ2 fiber (Fig. 1). This 
leads to a Lagrangian measure of folding relative to the initial fluid 
configuration, given by
κt

Fig. 1 | Lagrangian view of an active nematic fluid. The red curves demarcate  
the repelling and attracting regions in the flow identified by large values of  
the forward and backward FTLE. The repellers are based on the initial fluid 
configuration, whereas the attractors are based on the final configuration. 
Initially close tracers that are on opposite sides of a forward FTLE (fΛ) ridge will 
move far apart at time t. Similarly, initially distant tracers are attracted to a 
backward FTLE (bΛ) ridge at time t. Moreover an infinitesimal patch of nematic 
fluid at x0 will get stretched and folded over the time interval [t0, t]. Different fibres 
in this patch tend to align along the fiber ξ2(x0) corresponding to the maximally 
stretched direction, and the curvature of the folded patch is κt
t0(xt, ξ2).

The large-scale chaotic dynamics of these materials is collectively 
driven by kinesin molecular motors that move along multiple filaments 
to induce relative filament sliding.
Using particle image velocimetry (PIV), we reconstruct the  
velocity field of autonomously flowing active nematics. Supplementary  
Section 2 and Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2 provide details of the 
PIV-derived velocity and its validation for computing the Lagrangian 
trajectories. From the velocity field, we compute fΛ and bΛ for different  
timescales ∣T∣ = ∣t − t0∣ using equations (1)–(3). Figure 2a,b shows  
the fΛ and bΛ fields for ∣T∣ = 100 s. As sketched in Fig. 1, particles are 
repelled from a fΛ ridge and attracted towards a bΛ ridge (covered by 
magenta dots). Figure 2c shows the final position of a set of particles 
initially released from a uniform grid and serves as a tracker of parti-
cle motion. Supplementary Video 1 shows the time evolution of the  
FTLE fields and particle positions. Although the active fluid seems  
to move chaotically, there is an underlying coherent skeleton, captured 
by the FTLE fields, that dynamically organizes their motion but remains 
inaccessible from the mere inspection of fluid tracers.
The FTLE also provides a ∣T∣-dependent map of the stretching  
and shearing Lagrangian deformation of the active continuum,  
with ridges that demarcate sets of the fluid that will experience  
higher deformations relative to their neighbours. Along the tra-
jectories, the Lagrangian deformation consistently integrates the  
separate contributions of viscous, elastic and active stresses deforming 
the nematic fluid and thus encodes a memory trace of the nemato­
dynamic field.
To correlate these computed Lagrangian memory traces with 
direct observations of the deformation patterns near bΛ ridges, we label 
the regions of microtubule-based active nematics and observe their 
subsequent evolution (Supplementary Section 2). This is achieved by 
photobleaching nine circular regions with a radius of ~4 μm (Fig. 2d). 
Using the PIV data, we compute the bΛ field along with the position of 
Lagrangian tracers (magenta) initialized at t = 0 in correspondence 
with the photobleached regions (Fig. 2e). Stripe-shaped ridges of bΛ0
148 
reveal a horizontal shear layer, along with regions of distinctly high 
attraction and Lagrangian deformations. Our analysis predicts the 
evolution of advected and diffused photobleached patches (Fig. 2f and 
Supplementary Video 2). Overall, bΛ0
T provides a ∣T∣-dependent map 
of attraction as well as stretching and shearing deformations maps 
over the entire domain.
Positive defects mediate attracting CSs
Having uncovered the organizers of the flow fields using Lagrangian 
CSs, we now turn to understand if and how they are related to the visible 
dynamics of topological defects, well known to be correlated with com-
plex, large-scale nematodynamic flows15,17. To enable this, we redid our 
experiments with the microtubule-kinesin system, slowed the dynamics 
by reducing ATP concentration to 2 μM and simultaneously measured 
both velocity v and nematic director n fields (Supplementary Section 2).
We mark +1/2 defects with red dots and −1/2 defects with cyan 
triangles (Fig. 1). Figure 3a–c shows bΛ for increasing time intervals, 
along with the positions of tracers (magenta), initially released from 
a circular blob and eventually attracted to a bΛ ridge. Supplementary 
Video 3 shows the time evolution of fΛ and bΛ along with particle posi-
tions. The FTLE fields again uncover the organizers of fluid motion that 
are inaccessible to trajectory plots alone.
Along with bΛ, Fig. 3a–c shows the evolution of topological defects, 
with the red arrows indicating the direction of motion of positive 
defects. These data suggest that positive defects move and deform bΛ 
ridges, which, in turn, directs particle motion. Displaying the director 
field with the bΛ field (Fig. 3c) shows that n aligns with the bΛ ridges, 
suggesting that the director tends to align with the direction of maxi-
mum stretching17. The entire time evolution of n and bΛ is shown in 
Supplementary Video 3 (middle). Interestingly, +1/2 defects appear to 
be in regions of low Lagrangian stretching or shearing deformation as 
quantified by the FTLE field. By contrast, the Lagrangian folding meas-
ure is maximum at the defects (Fig. 3d), where the absolute folding 
field |κt
t0(xt, ξ2)| is superimposed to the nematic director n at the same 
time as that in Fig. 3a.
To further quantify our observations on deformations at defects 
and the correlation of their dynamics with the FTLE bΛ, next we turn to 
numerical simulations of an incompressible (∇ ⋅ v = 0) planar uniaxial

and a4 are the bulk moduli. Finally, σe = −λSH + QH − HQ denotes the  
elastic stress arising from a departure from the lowest free-energy 
configuration and σa = αQ is the contractile (α > 0) or extensile (α < 0) 
active stress exerted by the active particles along n. We non- 
dimensionalize distances by the length scale ℓ = L/5, where L is the  
system size, time by the viscous timescale τ = ρℓ2/η and energy by  
ℰ= K . Since the typical Reynolds number of microtubules/kinesin 
suspensions varies in the range of 10−5−10−3 depending on the ATP  
concentration, we eliminate the convective derivative in equation (6a) 
and numerically integrate equations (6a) and (6b) using finite differ-
ences on a 128 × 128 collocated grid with periodic boundary conditions.  
Following 15, we select our parameters so that the nematodynamic flows 
are turbulent and show that our results apply even to chaotic regimes. 
In all our simulations, we set the parameter values as follows: λ = 0.1, 
K = 1, a2 = −1, a4 = 2, γ = 10, α = −25 and L = 5, in previously defined 
rescaled units (Supplementary Section 3 provides the selection of 
parameters). This yields the velocity field v along with the nematic 
tensor field Q, from which we identify the topological defects  
(Supplementary Section 4). Our results apply to both contractile  
and extensile cases. We show extensile experimental and numerical 
datasets in the main text and contractile active nematics in the  
Supplementary Information.
Figure 4a–c shows bΛ for different time intervals ∣T∣, along  
with the position of an initially circular set of particles (magenta) that 
are attracted to a bΛ ridge. Analogous to our results of the analysis  
of the experiments, we find that bΛ ridges are pulled (red arrows)  
and shaped by moving Eulerian +1/2 defects and remain insensitive 
to –1/2 defects (Fig. 4a–c). In Supplementary Section 4 and Supple-
mentary Fig. 3, we quantify the correlation between the evolution  
of bΛ and defect motion. We first find a velocity field that transports  
and deforms bΛ over increasing T, and evaluate it at defects. The bΛ 
evolution along with defect velocities are provided in Supplementary  
Video 5. We then compute the relative angle between the bΛ velocity  
at defects and defects velocities. The mean and standard deviation  
of the relative angle associated with positive defects are six times smaller 
compared to those related to negative defects. We perform the same  
analysis on the experimental data in Fig. 3 and find that the mean and  
standard deviation of the relative angle associated with positive  
defects are three and four times smaller, respectively, compared  
with those related to negative defects (Supplementary Section 4).  
Supplementary Video 6 is similar to Supplementary Video 5 but for  
the experimental data. We note that bΛ is Lagrangian, that is, it con-
tains information of particle trajectories, whereas defects are Eulerian  
and hence agnostic to particle paths. This connection could provide  
a quantitative framework to control the Lagrangian motion and defor-
mation of active nematics by steering the position of Eulerian defects.
As in Fig. 3c, Fig. 4c shows that n tends to align with attracting 
bΛ ridges. By contrast, in contractile active nematics simulated using 
equations (6a) and (6b) with the same parameters of the extensile 
case and α = 25, we find that n tends to be perpendicular to attracting 
bΛ ridges (Supplementary Section 5 and Supplementary Fig. 4). In 
Supplementary Section 6 and Supplementary Fig. 5, we perform the 
same analysis as that in Fig. 4 on simulated extensile active nematic  
in confined geometry characterized by dancing defects29 and find 
again that n tends to align with attracting bΛ ridges, consistent with 
Figs. 3c and 4c. In Supplementary Section 7 and Supplementary Fig. 6, 
we provide a mechanistic argument that explains these observations. 
First, we show that in extensile (contractile) nematics, n tends to align 
with (perpendicular to) the leading eigenvector e2 of D. This provides a 
precise connection between n and Eulerian—or short-time—attractors 
(repellers)19, which are parallel (perpendicular) to e2. Then, we relate n 
to Lagrangian attractors.
In Supplementary Section 8 and Supplementary Fig. 7, we  
also provide an aggregate measure of positional coherence by

using the inverse of the broadly used H−1 mixing norm30, and show  
how it decreases with increasing integration time T and activity α.  
Our results are consistent with17 where it was discovered that in  
the asymptotic limit T→∞, the braiding of positive defects contri­
butes dominantly to the increase in topological entropy in active  
nematics. However, although17 quantifies the contribution of  
+1/2 defects to the aggregate (that is, space-independent) mixing,  
here we focus and uncover dynamic spatial structures (attracting 
Lagrangian CSs) that shape particle motion while being steered  
by +1/2 defects. In other words, we identify the spatiotemporal  
organizer of active nematics that complement previous analyses  
of global mixing properties. Figure 4d shows κt
t0(xt,ξξξ2) associated  
with |T∣ = 2 (Fig. 4c). Consistent with our experimental results  
(Fig. 3), we see that +1/2 defects are preferentially located in regions  
of high Lagrangian folding and low stretching. We obtain results  
similar to Fig. 4 for contractile (α > 0) active nematics, simulated  
using the same parameters listed above and α = 25 (Supplementary 
Section 5). Supplementary Video 7 shows the same data as Supple­
mentary Video 4 but for the contractile case. Finally, in Supplementary 
Section 9 and Supplementary Fig. 8, we confirm that Lagrangian  
structures contained in bΛ and κ remain typically inaccessible  
to Eulerian quantities such as the director field n, the nematic  
order parameter S, the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the 
rate-of-strain tensor, the velocity divergence ∇ ⋅ v, and bend and splay 
elastic energies.
Stress gradients are maximum at positive defects
Motivated by the striking deformations associated with +1/2 defects,  
we analyse the stress distribution using the simulation data for  
extensile active nematics in Fig. 4. We find that the magnitude of  
both deviatoric and isotropic total stresses are minimum at +1/2  
defects, but their gradients have high values at these locations  
along the defect orientation (Fig. 5a,b), and thus induces folding  
deformation (Fig. 5d). We obtain similar results for contractile active 
nematics (Supplementary Section 10 and Supplementary Fig. 9), where 
the folding direction is towards the head of the defect as opposed to 
the tail (Fig. 5d).
To bridge the gap between the Lagrangian deformations, which 
accounts for the motion history of the nematic continuum, and Eulerian 
deformations based on an instantaneous configuration, we derived an 
exact formula for the Eulerian folding rate
̇κ(t, x, n) = [(∇∇∇D(x, t)n)n] ⋅n⟂⟂⟂−∇∇∇ω(x, t) ⋅n

experienced by an infinitesimal patch of nematic fluid with orientation 
n (Supplementary Section 1). The folding rate can be computed from 
v and n, and arises from spatial heterogeneities of the rate-of-strain 
tensor D and vorticity ω. For example, if the nematic continuum is an 
epithelium, ̇κ(t, x, n) measures the bending rate experienced by the 
cell located at x with orientation n. Using equation (8), we also find

Fig. 4 | Lagrangian analysis of a simulated extensile active nematic fluid.  
The nematic fluid obeys equations (6a) and (6b). a, bΛ for ∣T∣ = 1.6, along with  
the position of material particles (magenta) attracted to a bΛ ridge and initially 
released from a circular blob. b,c, Same as a, but for larger ∣T∣. The red arrows 
illustrate that +1/2 defects pull the attracting bΛ ridges that, in turn, shape particle 
motion. In c, the red segments display the director field. d, Logarithm of the

that ̇κ(t, x, n) is the maximum in the vicinity of +1/2 defects (Fig. 5c), 
consistent with the corresponding stress distribution (Fig. 5a,b) and 
Lagrangian folding (Fig. 4).
It is interesting to compare these results with experimental find-
ings that suggest a biological consequence of topological defects in 
epithelial layers12,31,32, where the deformations and stress at the defects 
is thought to elucidate how mechanical stimuli are converted into 
downstream biochemical signals. Positive defects with strength +1/2 
in monolayers of Madin–Darby canine kidney cells, for example, have 
been associated with sites of cell apoptosis31, with a possible explana-
tion being the high compressive stress at the defect location. This 
hypothesis has been tested by correlating the isotropic stress aver-
aged over several (~6) cell sizes in the neighbourhood of a topological 
defect during apoptosis31. Our findings, however, show that bending 
deformations are dominant at positive defects, suggesting that there 
may be other mechanisms at play associated with bending deforma-
tions at topological defects.
We observe a clear similarity of the extensile active nematic stress 
distribution (Fig. 5) with that experimentally measured in monolayers 
of Madin–Darby canine kidney cells31 during apoptosis. It is worth 
noting that the novel stress and deformation distribution around +1/2 
defects, together with the known ability of cells to sense curvature 
changes33, may lead to uncovering new feedback mechanisms in active 
epithelial dynamics34,35.
Discussion
By combining concepts from nonlinear dynamics, experiments  
on two-dimensional active nematics, and simulations of active  
nematodynamics equations, we found that the motion of active  
nematics is organized by dynamic (time-dependent) attracting  
and repelling CSs, whose motion is coupled to that of +1/2 topo­logical 
defects. As the defects move, they deform attracting CSs, which in 
turn regulate collective motion. Furthermore, the Lagrangian 
timescale-dependent maps of stretching- and folding-type deforma-
tions of a nematic continuum show that +1/2 defects are correlated  
with locations of high bending and low stretching-type or shearing- 
type deformations. Motivated by this finding, we have discovered a 
characteristic stress distribution around +1/2 defects: the stress is 
the minimum at the defect, but its large gradient along the defect’s 
orientation causes differential stress that induces bending. The bend-
ing is towards the defect head (tail) for contractile (extensile) active 
nematics. Similar stress distributions were experimentally measured 
in monolayers of Madin–Darby canine kidney cells31. Finally, we have 
observed and explained that the nematic director tends to align along 
(perpendicular to) attracting Eulerian and Lagrangian CSs18,19 for exten-
sile (contractile) active nematics.
More broadly, using only the measured velocity and nematic direc-
tor, our results provide a quantitative framework for assessing the 
motion, mixing and deformation of active nematics. Emerging experi-
mental evidence associates biological functionality with topological 
defects of cells orientation12, actin fibre orientation36 and the ability 
of cells to sense and react to bending and stretching deformations33. 
From this perspective, our approach quantifies the stretching and 
folding deformations in a nematic continuum as timescale-dependent 
maps. Investigating the correlation between curvature and stretching 
deformation maps in epithelial layers and other similar systems could 
elucidate how cells couple mechanical inputs to intracellular signals 
in oriented active matter systems.

FTLE, Lagrangian folding and Eulerian folding rates
Given a modelled or experimental planar velocity field v(x, t), we  
compute the Lagrangian attractors and repellers from backward  
and forward FTLE (equation (3)). To compute the FTLE, we first calcu-
late Ft
t0(x0) (equation (1)) by integrating the cell velocity field v(x, t) 
using the built-in Runge–Kutta solver ODE45 in MATLAB 2021b with 
absolute and relative tolerance of 10−6, linear interpolation in space 
and time and a uniform dense grid of initial conditions. Then, we com-
pute ∇∇∇Ft
t0(x0) taking the spatial derivatives of Ftf
t0(x0) with respect to  
the initial conditions using centred finite-difference approximation. 
Using equation (2), we compute Ct
t0(x0) and use the eigenvalue MATLAB 
function to calculate its largest eigenvalue field λ2 and the correspond-
ing eigenvector field ξ2. Using numerical centred finite differencing, 
we calculate the second spatial derivatives of Ft
t0(x0) and compute the 
Lagrangian folding field κ from equation (4). Using the same numerical 
schemes, we compute the Eulerian folding rate field ̇κ (equation (8)).
Topological defects
We discuss the identification of topological defects, calculation of 
defect velocity and their correlation with the motion of Lagrangian 
attractors in detail in Supplementary Section 4.
