# Zetetics: The Art of Inquiry

## Overview

Zetetics is a branch of Pyrrhonism, an ancient Greek philosophy of skepticism. It represents a method of inquiry that is continually searching for truth but maintains a non-committal stance towards any conclusive beliefs.

## Philosophical Foundations

Zetetics comes from the Greek word _ζητητικός_, meaning "inquisitive" or "seeking." Unlike ephectics who simply suspend judgment, zetetics actively engage in examining claims to uncover the complexities of knowledge and understanding.

### Core Concepts
- **Skepticism**: Central to the zetetic approach is a deep-seated skepticism of accepted knowledge.
- **Continuous Inquiry**: The zetetic method involves a persistent investigation into beliefs and theories.

## Methodology

Zetetics utilize the following methods in their philosophical inquiry:

1. **Dialectical Analysis**: Engaging in dialogue to dissect and examine arguments.
2. **Modes of Skepticism**: Applying systematic approaches to challenge the stability and reliability of perceptions and doctrines.

```python
def examine_claim(claim):
    # An example function to illustrate zetetic inquiry
    print(f"Examining the claim: {claim}")
    # Placeholder for analysis logic
    return "Inconclusive"
