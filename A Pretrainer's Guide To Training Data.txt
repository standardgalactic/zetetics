Abstract
Pretraining is the preliminary and fundamental step in developing capable language models (LM). Despite
this, pretraining data design is critically under-documented and often guided by empirically unsupported
intuitions. To address this, we pretrain 28 1.5B parameter decoder-only models, training on data curated (1)
at diﬀerent times, (2) with varying toxicity and quality ﬁlters, and (3) with diﬀerent domain compositions.
First, we quantify the eﬀect of pretraining data age. A temporal shift between evaluation data and pretraining
data leads to performance degradation, which is not overcome by ﬁnetuning. Second, we explore the eﬀect
of quality and toxicity ﬁlters, showing a trade-oﬀbetween performance on standard benchmarks and
risk of toxic generations. Our ﬁndings indicate there does not exist a one-size-ﬁts-all solution to ﬁltering
training data. We also ﬁnd that the eﬀects of diﬀerent types of ﬁltering are not predictable from text domain
characteristics. Lastly, we empirically validate that the inclusion of heterogeneous data sources, like books
and web, is broadly beneﬁcial and warrants greater prioritization. These ﬁndings constitute the largest set of
experiments to validate, quantify, and expose many undocumented intuitions about text pretraining, which
we hope will help support more informed data-centric decisions in LM development.

Introduction
The strong performance (Chowdhery et al., 2022; Nostalgebraist, 2022; OpenAI, 2023; Google, 2023), and
emergent abilities (Wei et al., 2022) of modern language models (LMs) depend on self-supervised pretraining
on massive text datasets. All model developers implicitly or explicitly decide the composition of these
datasets: what data sources to include, whether to ﬁlter for attributes such as quality and toxicity, and
when to gather new documents. While many of the most prominent models do not document their curation
procedures (OpenAI, 2023; Google, 2023), or only document which procedures they used (Brown et al., 2020;
Nostalgebraist, 2022; Scao et al., 2022; Touvron et al., 2023), they rarely document why they chose those
protocols or what eﬀect they had. This documentation debt leaves practitioners to be guided by intuitions
and precedents, neither thoroughly evaluated (Bandy and Vincent, 2021; Sambasivan et al., 2021). Given the
outsized and fundamental role of pretraining data in modern LMs, we believe this neglectful practice has
detracted from responsible data use and hampered eﬀective model development (Rogers, 2021; Gebru et al.,
2021; Bender and Friedman, 2018).
Among the small number of general-purpose LMs dominating community use and discussion, the prevailing
focus has been on the scale of pretraining data and number of optimization steps (Brown et al., 2020;
Nostalgebraist, 2022; Google, 2023). In this work, we systematically test how common data design decisions
aﬀect model performance—speciﬁcally: the time of collection, content ﬁltering strategy (toxicity/quality),
and domain composition. We study the impacts in two ways. First, we present observational measurements
of the eﬀect of existing quality and toxicity ﬁltering methods (Section 3). We document how these ﬁlters
aﬀect a range of characteristics in two major pretraining datasets, C4 (Raﬀel et al., 2020) and the Pile (Gao
et al., 2020). Second, we rigorously evaluate these dataset design decisions on downstream tasks. This
is done by evaluating decoder-only autoregressive LMs each pretrained on a dataset modiﬁed along one
dimension of time, toxicity, quality, or domain composition. Our contributions are summarized as ﬁndings
and recommendations to model developers.
The Age of a Dataset (Section 4). We see performance degradation if evaluation data is either before or
after pretraining data collection, and this deﬁcit isn’t overcome with substantial ﬁnetuning. Further, this
phenomenon is exacerbated in larger models. While rarely acknowledged, we show its eﬀect can meaningfully
complicate comparisons between new and old models, depending on the age of the evaluation dataset.
Quality and Toxicity Filters (Section 5). Filtering for document quality and toxicity have signiﬁcant but
opposite eﬀects on model behaviour. Quality ﬁltering, removing low-quality text, substantially increases both
toxic generation and downstream performance across tasks we tested, despite reducing the amount of training
data. On the other hand, removing toxic data trades-oﬀfewer toxic generations for reduced generalization
performance. Inverse toxicity ﬁlters, which remove the least toxic content, demonstrate targeted beneﬁts.
Lastly, evaluation on datasets with high quality text aren’t necessarily improved by removing low-quality
text from the dataset. Performance eﬀects due to quality ﬁltering are mostly positive, but the beneﬁts are not
predictable from text characteristics. These ﬁndings demonstrate that one size (ﬁlter) does not ﬁt all, and there
is a need for practitioners to develop more targeted quality or inverse toxicity ﬁlters for their tasks.
Domain Compositions (Section 6). The best performing domains comprise high-quality (Books) and
heterogeneous (Web) data, corroborating Brown et al. (2020); Chowdhery et al. (2022); Xie et al. (2023a).
However, these text sources contribute most to toxic generation. Still, we found that the beneﬁts of training on
these data sources is often greater than data collection for a targeted domain, and so recommend practitioners
focus future collection on more books and diverse web data. Additionally, our best performing models still
use all data sources (even at the relatively small scale of 1.5B parameters); thus, we recommend practitioners
generously include data sources less relevant to their downstream tasks (Madaan et al., 2022).
To our knowledge, these experiments constitute the largest publicly documented LM data curation study,
spanning 28 1.5B parameter models. Their ﬁndings empirically quantify, validate, and, occasionally, challenge the
entrenched set of under-examined pretraining assumptions; which we believe justiﬁes their computational
cost (Section 8). As the majority of the community has adopted a small set of models for most research and
applications (BERT, T5, GPT-2, GPT-3), pretraining data curation decision have long-term ramiﬁcations. We
hope these results better inform model developers training the next wave of LMs.

Methodology
We measure how pretraining data curation choices aﬀect downstream performance. Figure 1 illustrates
our approach: each experiment starts with a pretraining dataset, applies a ﬁlter that removes documents,
pretrains a language model on the curated dataset, and ﬁnally evaluates the model on downstream tasks.
2.1
Pretraining Datasets
We begin with two common, publicly available pretraining datasets: C4 (Raﬀel et al., 2020) and the Pile (Gao
et al., 2020). Both have received basic initial heuristic ﬁltering for English language and content quality. We
further deduplicate both datasets using the approximate deduplication method described in Lee et al. (2022).
C4 (Raﬀel et al., 2020)
The English Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus (C4) is a snapshot of Common Crawl
from 2019, which includes a mix of news, legal, wikipedia, and generic web documents (Dodge et al., 2021),
ﬁltered for well-formed English text.∗While the original version of C4 ﬁltered out any documents containing
words from a “bad words list”, our version does not. C4 remains one of the most widely adopted fully open
source datasets for textual training, given its permissive license. It is a key component of many LMs, as
shown in Table 1.
The Pile (Gao et al., 2020)
is an 800GB dataset consisting of data from 22 sources. These include a Common
Crawl web scrape as well as more diverse collections of academic, books, coding, medical, legal and social
sources (see Table 8), which more closely resemble the reported data sources in larger non-open source
models like PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), Chinchilla (Hoﬀmann et al., 2022), and the GPT-3 series (Brown
et al., 2020).

2.2
Data Curation Choices
We evaluate variations in the pretraining data based on three categories of interventions.
Dataset Age
We create new versions of C4 by regenerating snapshots of the Common Crawl from diﬀerent
years (see Figure 10). Multiple time-based collections are not available for the Pile.
Domain Filtering
Both C4 and the Pile draw from multiple distinct data sources, but the Pile explicitly
delineates 22 distinct sources from web pages, wikipedia articles, code repositories, online forums, legal texts,
and research paper archives. To control for the topical content of the pretraining collection, we selectively
remove documents from diﬀerent domains (see Table 8).
Content Filtering
Datasets derived from the Common Crawl and other weakly curated internet sources tend
to contain large amounts of low-quality, toxic, or oﬀensive content. As a result, curators often apply content-
based ﬁlters. Deciding what to include and what not to include is a challenging and context-dependent
problem: A “high-quality” Reddit post does not look like a “high-quality“ academic paper; and even with
academic papers, quality measured by peer review has high variance (Cortes and Lawrence, 2021).
There are several approaches to determining document appropriateness. The simplest ﬁlters use features
such as sentence length, presence of stopwords and punctuation, and repetitiousness to identify pages that
do not contain usable text (Rae et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2019; Laurençon et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2022).
Negatively-deﬁned ﬁlters identify a category of text to be removed, and assume that everything else is
usable. For example, Raﬀel et al. (2020) remove documents that contain words from a list of “bad words”.
Positively-deﬁned ﬁlters identify a category of text to keep, and remove everything else (Du et al., 2022;
Touvron et al., 2023; Brown et al., 2020).
In this work, we evaluate the impact of two document-level, classiﬁer-based ﬁlters that have been used widely
in the development of state-of-the-art language models. These include negatively-deﬁned, toxic content
(text that is profane, explicit, insulting, or threatening) and postively-deﬁned quality content (text similar
to known “high-quality” sources). It is important to emphasize that we do not have ground truth: for the
purposes of this paper we will use the description toxic or quality to refer to a document that triggers one of
these automated classiﬁers, not to indicate a document that achieves those characteristics for a human reader.
Quality Filters
Most recent language models create quality classiﬁers to distinguish between “high-quality”
corpora and other documents (Table 1). These are usually then applied to crawled web pages. Examples of
high-quality reference corpora are (1) Wikipedia, WebText and books for GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020), (2)
Wikipedia, books and a few selected websites for PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022) and GLaM (Du et al., 2022),
and (3) pages used as references in Wikipedia for LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023). In our work, we use the
classiﬁer employed by PaLM and GLaM, which assigns each document a score from 0 (high quality) to 1
(low quality). We experiment with removing documents that fall above four quality thresholds: 0.975, 0.95,
0.9, 0.7, along with an inverse ﬁlter that instead removes the highest quality documents below a threshold.
Toxicity Filters
To identify toxic content, we use Jigsaw’s Perspective API †, which was trained on comments
from online forums and assigns toxicity scores based on whether annotators found the comment to contain
profanity/obscenity, identity-based negativity, insults, or threats. While the Perspective API, as with any
classiﬁer, has been shown to be imperfect—it falsely labels some neutral text as toxic and its training data
reﬂects the normative values of its annotators—it has been shown to be far more accurate than heuristic and
rule-based classiﬁers (Friedl, 2023; Gargee et al., 2022; Lees et al., 2022).
The Perspective API outputs a score from 0 (unlikely to be toxic) to 1 (very likely to be toxic). The documen-
tation recommends using a score threshold of anywhere from 0.3 to 0.9 to ﬁlter documents, depending on
the practitioner’s goals.‡ We experiment with removing documents with scores above ﬁve diﬀerent toxicity

threshold values 0.95, 0.9, 0.7, 0.5, and 0.3. Documents above a given threshold are ﬁltered out, along with
an inverse ﬁlter that removes documents with the least predicted toxicity below a threshold.
In addition to the classiﬁer-based ﬁlter, we also experiment with the n-gram based ﬁlter used by Raﬀel et al.
(2020) in the original version of the C4 dataset. This ﬁlter removes all documents that contain any word
present in the “List of Dirty, Naughty, Obscene, or Otherwise Bad Words”.§
2.3
Evaluation
To measure the eﬀects of time, topic and toxicity, we evaluate pretrained models on English-language tasks
for toxicity identiﬁcation, toxic generation, dozens of question-answering (QA) tasks from diverse domains,
and several tasks with temporal annotations. In choosing evaluations, we compare the general utility of the
diﬀerent models, as well as their performance on tasks we expect to be inﬂuenced by the dataset characteristics
being ablated. Since we are comparing the performance of diﬀerent pretrained models, we evaluate the
performance of each pretrained model on downstream tasks by ﬁnetuning the model on the relevant dataset
for each task and evaluated on the same testing data (using the default splits for each task unless otherwise
noted). As a result, any systematic diﬀerences between ﬁnetuned results can only be attributable to diﬀerences
in pretraining. For all tasks we report mean performance relative to a baseline, usually the performance of
models trained on an unﬁltered dataset.
Evaluating Domain Generalization
We evaluate on the union of two question-answering benchmarks:
Machine Reading for Question Answering (MRQA) (Fisch et al., 2019) and UniﬁedQA (Khashabi et al.,
2020), which together consist of 30 unique QA datasets. These QA datasets span a range of domains, allowing
us to measure the impact of topic alignment (see Table 9).
Evaluating Temporal Misalignment
Prior work has shown that a dataset’s collection time can aﬀect the
downstream model’s abilities (Lazaridou et al., 2021; Agarwal and Nenkova, 2022). Luu et al. (2021) release
several datasets in which increasing temporal distance between ﬁnetuning and evaluation time decreases test
performance. We choose 5 of these datasets from varying domains to evaluate whether a similar phenomenon
exists between pretraining and evaluation time: PubCLS, NewSum, PoliAﬀs, TwiERC, and AIC.
Evaluating Toxic Generation
Generateing profane, sexually explicit, insulting, or obscene text or text that
attacks identity groups or targets protected human attributes limits the applications LMs may be used for
(Gehman et al., 2020). We evaluate this behavior with language model prompts designed to elicit biased or
toxic outputs related to gender, race, and religion (Chowdhery et al., 2022), and then measuring the fraction
of generated continuations which are assigned a high toxicity score by the Perspective API (see Appendix
C.3 for details). We also use the RealToxicityPrompts dataset (Gehman et al., 2020), which consists of text
excerpts from the OpenWebText dataset (Gokaslan* et al., 2019) that were labeled as toxic by the Perspective
API.
Evaluating Toxicity Identiﬁcation
While some applications require LMs not to generate toxic text, in
other applications it is important for LMs to recognize such language. Toxicity Identiﬁcation has become
particularly critical as a step in content moderation for major communication platforms (NYT, 2020; Singh,
2019). Deﬁnitions vary by setting, targeting hate speech, stereotypes, social bias, or some deﬁnition of toxicity.
We evaluate this ability with a variety of toxicity interpretations, using train and test sets from Social Bias
Frames (SBF, Sap et al., 2020), DynaHate (DH, Vidgen et al., 2021), and Toxigen (Hartvigsen et al., 2022).¶
2.4
Models
For all our experiments, we use two sizes of decoder-only, Transformer-based language models, trained in
the T5X codebase (Roberts et al., 2022). Our main experiments use LM-XL, a 1.5B parameter decoder-only
§https://github.com/LDNOOBW/List-of-Dirty-Naughty-Obscene-and-Otherwise-Bad-Words
¶We use the oﬀensiveness detection task from Social Bias Frames. DynaHate releases 4 rounds of adversarial datasets, for which we
use the test sets for Round 3 (R3) and Round 4 (R4).

model similar to the t5.1.1-XL architecture conﬁguration trained with an autoregressive next-token-prediction
objective. For experiments that measure scaling eﬀects, we use LM-Small, a 20M parameter decoder-only
model similar to the t5.1.1-small conﬁguration. These conﬁgurations are popular, show decent performance
(Wang et al., 2022) and can generate text without additional ﬁnetuning. Additional details on pretraining
and ﬁnetuning are available in Appendix C

Impact of Data Curation on Data Characteristics
Section Findings
• The Pile’s documents are on average longer, more readable and higher quality than documents in
C4 but contain more personally identiﬁable information (PII).
• Books is an outlier domain, having the longest, most readable, most toxic, and most PII-ﬁlled
documents, while also containing high-quality text.
• High toxicity and low quality documents have similarly high PII amounts but otherwise have very
diﬀerent average length and quality and toxicity levels.
• More recent web-scraped text is more diverse and less toxic but also lower quality.
Before evaluating the eﬀect of data ablations on models, we present observational statistics on the pretraining
datasets themselves. This analysis reveals how the Pile’s domains compare to C4 and to one another, and
how curation or ﬁltering choices impact features of the data, sometimes inadvertently. We ﬁnd that there are
substantial interactions between curation choices.
We calculate a range of features for each document, including toxicity and quality metrics; categories of
personally identiﬁable information (PII); and text statistics such as average word length, readability, type-
token ratio, and sentiment. For more details and analysis on these features see Appendix D.
C4 vs the Pile
Figure 9 shows the diﬀerences between the two source datasets. Documents in the Pile are
on average longer (2.4x), have more non-ASCII characters (1.9x) indicating greater linguistic range, and are
also measured as higher quality (1.2x) and more readable (1.8x). Pile documents also contain more PII, in
particular personal names, addresses, and emails.
Toxicity and Quality
While it is reasonable to assume that high toxicity should correlate with low quality,
Figure 2 shows that the relationship is more complicated: in fact, toxicity and quality are not well-aligned
with one another. High toxicity documents have higher text quality than low toxicity documents. There is
also little discernible diﬀerence in feature measurements for profanity, toxicity, and sexually explicit content
between content classiﬁed as low vs. high quality.
Domains
Looking at characteristics of the Pile by domain in Figure 2 suggests an explanation. The Books
subset stands out as having substantially more profane, toxic, and sexual content, but also greater predicted
quality. While we might expect books to be high quality, in the sense that they typically contain meaningful,
well-edited sentences, they also contain strong language and erotic subjects. This may also explain why
documents classiﬁed as high toxicity in both C4 and the Pile are much longer (2.5x and 3.5x respectively),
more profane (5x and 4.4x), sexually explicit (4.6x and 4.2x), and toxic (3.6x and 3.5x). However, Pile
documents with high toxicity are 1.4-1.9 times more likely to have PII of various kinds, while in C4 this is not
true. Documents classiﬁed as high quality in C4 were longer (1.3x and 1.2x), and had more names (1.6x and
1.8x), but fewer emails, addresses, and phone numbers.
Among the domains we studied, OpenWeb provides the most lexical and linguistic diversity, with the
highest non-ASCII characters and type-token ratio. Wikipedia presents the highest quality text, before Books
and OpenWeb. Technical domains such as PubMed, Code, and Academic score low on predicted quality,

The Pile

the Pile
Figure 2: Feature diﬀerences across slices of the pretraining datasets. Bars show the ratio between the mean feature
value for the slice and the mean value for the dataset (the Pile or C4), which is indicated by a horizontal gray line. For
example, Wiki text has half the profanity and three times the quality values as the average for the Pile.
indicating that overly-speciﬁc positively-deﬁned ﬁlters on web documents may remove substantial amounts
of potentially useful specialized text.
Time
Comparing across diﬀerent collection times of C4 (in Figure 9), we see a couple of steady trends. The
percentage of non-ASCII characters increased steadily in more recent years while the measured text quality
declines. This growth may be due to increasing non-English content, but could also correspond to rising use
of emojis and non-ASCII punctuation. Toxicity scores also decrease slightly in later years, while sentiment
increases.

Impact of Dataset Age on Pretrained Models
Section Findings
• Both models and evaluation datasets become stale.
• Temporal misalignment between pretraining and evaluation data is not overcome by ﬁnetuning.
• Temporal misalignment complicates evaluation of models trained at diﬀerent times, as older
evaluation datasets may become stale and newer evaluation datasets may under-estimate performance
of older models.
• The eﬀects of pretraining misalignment are stronger for larger models than smaller models.
While models are frequently and cheaply updated with new ﬁnetuning data, the expense of pretraining means
the NLP community has relied on relatively few static pretrained models that are rarely updated or exchanged.
BERT, RoBERTa, GPT-2, and T5 variants, all pretrained prior to 2020, constitute the majority (estimated at
~58% as of April 16, 2023) of all models downloaded on HuggingFace. Prior work demonstrates that language
use changes over time (Altmann et al., 2009; Labov, 2011) and that temporal misalignment between ﬁnetuning
and evaluation datasets correlates with degraded performance, visible across settings and domains (Luu
et al., 2021; Lazaridou et al., 2021; Agarwal and Nenkova, 2022; Jang et al., 2022). In contrast, we examine
the eﬀect of temporal misalignment between pretraining data and evaluation. In evaluating the impact of
pretraining time across data domains, we can quantify the impact this design choice has on NLP broadly.

Figure 3: Temporal Misalignment between Pretraining and Evaluation causes performance degradation. Four LM-
XL’s, each pretained on a diﬀerent C4 time split, are evaluated on each time split across ﬁve datasets. Heatmap colors are
normalized by column, following Luu et al. (2021) to show the best pretraining year for each evaluation year.
We pretrain four autoregressive language models on versions of C4: 2013, 2016, 2019, and 2022. For each
version we begin with Common Crawl data and remove all data that was scraped after the cutoﬀyear.
Following Luu et al. (2021), we measure the eﬀect of temporal misalignment by using evaluation tasks (from
News, Twitter, and Science domains) that have training and test sets split by year. After pretraining, we
ﬁnetune each model on each dataset’s training-year split separately, then evaluate on every test-year split.
Full details and results are in Appendix C.4 and Appendix E.1, respectively.
First, we replicate the performance degradation observed by Luu et al. (2021) due to ﬁnetuning and evaluation
misalignment on the ﬁve tasks in Figure 12. Next, we estimate the eﬀects of temporal misalignment between
9

pretraining and evaluation (Figure 3). Since all models were ﬁnetuned on the training sets of the evaluation
tasks, we show that temporal misalignment during pretraining persists even with temporally-relevant
ﬁnetuning data.

Figure 4: The mean relative performance over 5 datasets (y-axis) increases as temporal misalignment (x-axis) ap-
proaches zero. The boxplot indicates the median (solid line), mean (triangles), quartile range (boxes), and rest of the
distribution (whiskers). Note that each dataset has diﬀerent evaluation year ranges.
Performance degradation strongly correlates with pretraining misalignment and its eﬀects are non-trivial.
Luu et al. (2021) formalize a deﬁnition for Temporal Degradation (TD), which measures the performance
change observed from one year diﬀerence between the ﬁnetuning and evaluation years. We generalize TD to
also measure the eﬀect of one year diﬀerence between pretraining time and evaluation time, as described
in Appendix C.4. Furthermore, we measure the Pearson correlation r between the performance diﬀerence
and the temporal diﬀerence to understand the strength of the correlation. In Table 2 we ﬁnd temporal
degradation is highest for ﬁnetuning (2.8 on average), as expected, but also surprisingly high for one year
of pretraining (0.4)—particularly for the News domain. The average Pearson correlation of 0.61 indicates a
strong correlation between pretraining temporal misalignment and performance degradation. All ﬁve tasks
pass a one-sided Wald test with p < 0.05, validating the slope is greater than zero.

Table 2: Temporal Degradation (TD) measures the expected performance degradation from one year of tem-
poral misalignment. We report TD ﬁrst between ﬁnetuning and evaluation, then pretraining and evaluation,
for LM-XL and LM-Small, across ﬁve tasks. Pearson correlation r indicates the correlation strength between
performance and temporal change. Temporal Degradation due to pretraining is signiﬁcant and persistent
across domains. All correlations are signiﬁcant at p < 0.05 unless marked with †.

Pretraining misalignment is not overcome by signiﬁcant ﬁnetuning.
The temporal degradation due to
pretraining suggests models pretrained on data from the same time frame as target evaluations will have
advantages over models trained on much older or newer data. Notably, this eﬀect is observed for models which
are ﬁnetuned on the full temporally-relevant training sets. This suggests that even substantial ﬁnetuning
cannot overcome pretraining data that is temporally misaligned.
Pretraining misalignment eﬀects are asymmetric and have implications for NLP evaluations.
We ob-
serve performance degradation regardless of whether the pretraining data was collected before or after the
evaluation data. While we would not expect a 2019 checkpoint to perform well on questions about COVID, we
also ﬁnd that 2022 checkpoints perform less well on Obama-era evaluations than earlier models. In particular,
Figure 4 shows performance degradation is asymmetric: it is steeper when the evaluation year is after the
pretraining year (blue bars) as opposed to the reverse (red bars). This ﬁnding suggests that both models
and evaluations become stale: older models perform less well than newer models on new evaluations and
newer models will perform less well on older evaluations. This phenomenon may have subtle implications
for NLP experiments comparing models pretrained at diﬀerent times. For instance, newer evaluation sets
may appear much more diﬃcult than old evaluation sets when applied to established, but less fresh, models.
Similarly, older evaluations may underestimate the capabilities of newer models.
Temporal Degradation is greater for larger models
We ﬁnd more temporal degradation for LM-XL (1.5B
parameters) than for LM-Small (20M parameters). As shown in Table 2, we do not ﬁnd the same temporal
degradation eﬀects of pretraining were signiﬁcant for LM-Small models. This suggests that larger models
may have a greater sensitivity to temporal information than smaller models, which may not have the capacity
to take advantage of subtle temporal features at all. Full results for LM-Small experiments are provided in
Appendix E.1.

Impact of Quality & Toxicity Filters on Pretrained Models
Section Findings
• Quality and toxicity ﬁlters have very diﬀerent eﬀects.
• Quality ﬁlters improve performance signiﬁcantly, despite removing training data.
• Quality ﬁltering eﬀects are not easily predicted by dataset characteristics. Future ﬁlters should
weigh more than one dimension of quality.
• Toxicity ﬁltering trades oﬀgeneralization and toxicity identiﬁcation ability for reduced risk of toxic
generation.
• When optimizing for toxicity identiﬁcation tasks, practitioners should use an inverse toxicity ﬁlter.
Most modern large language models use some form of quality and/or toxicity ﬁltering for their pretraining
datasets (Table 1). To curb toxicity, T5 uses n-gram ﬁlters, Gopher and Chinchilla use SafeSearch ﬁlters,
and LaMDA uses “safety discriminators”. Quality heuristics are universally applied for web-scraped data,
with newer models like LLaMA, the GPT-series and the PaLM-series all relying on quality classiﬁers. To
compare and quantify the eﬀects of these two ﬁlter types, we implement quality and toxicity ﬁlters at various
thresholds, as described in Section 2.2, to vary the quantity of toxic and low-quality text present when
pretraining models on the Pile and C4.
Quality ﬁlters signiﬁcantly improve performance across nearly all tasks, despite reducing training data
quantity and variety.
We see the quality ﬁlters improve nearly all downstream tasks: toxicity identiﬁcation
by 2% (Figure 5, right) and most QA task categories by 1-6% (Figure 6). Of most interest, these improvements
are realized despite removing 10%+ of the training data, even though we ﬁnd that removing data usually
leads to a decrease in performance (Section 6). While the average performance peaks at T = 0.975 for
the QA tasks, greater quality ﬁltering still outperforms the unﬁltered baseline on average. For the toxicity

Figure 6: Quality ﬁltering C4 increases LM-XL’s downstream performance on all QA task domains, except
for Books. The quality ﬁlter threshold is on the x-axis, with percentage of training data remaining in
parenthesis. Each column represents a set of QA evaluations from a domain. The ‘Full Dataset’ is unﬁltered,
and the ‘Inverse’ ﬁlter removes the highest quality data instead.
identiﬁcation experiments, the performance is still improving after T = 0.7, where 55% of the dataset has
been ﬁltered out.
Dataset quality characteristics are not strongly indicative of ﬁltering eﬀects.
In Section 3, Books, Wikipedia,
and Web data are classiﬁed as highest quality. Figure 6 shows that despite this, quality ﬁltering provides
the least beneﬁt to QA tasks in these categories, even hurting the performance for Books. On the other end,
academic and biomedical data are ranked among the lowest quality, but their QA tasks beneﬁt the most from
quality ﬁltering.
Optimizing on one measure of quality is not suﬃcient to predict or improve performance across domains.
Most interestingly, Wikipedia and Web QA tasks are among the most hurt by the inverse ﬁlter—suggesting
these domains are not aﬀected as much by the absence of the lowest quality data as the presence of the
highest quality data. Also unexpectedly, both the quality and inverse quality ﬁlters led to models with
higher toxic generation tendencies (Figure 5, right)—the one dimensional measure of quality captured by the
quality scores is not suﬃcient to explain this behaviour. In other words, diﬀerent segments of data along this
classiﬁer’s quality spectrum can have strong but varied eﬀects on diﬀerent domains. It suggests practitioners
should move beyond one measurement of quality and consider multiple.

Figure 7: Toxicity ﬁltering C4 reduces LM-XL’s downstream performance on most QA task domains. The
toxicity ﬁlter threshold is on the x-axis, with percentage of training data remaining in parentheses. Each
column represents a set of QA evaluations from a domain. The ‘Full Dataset’ is unﬁltered, and the ‘Inverse’
ﬁlter removes the lowest toxicity data instead.
One size does not ﬁt all. Toxicity Filtering leads to a trade-oﬀbetween toxic identiﬁcation and toxic
generation goals.
Filtering using a toxicity classiﬁer, we ﬁnd a trade-oﬀ: models trained from heavily
ﬁltered pretraining datasets have the least toxic generation but also the worst toxicity identiﬁcation (Figure 5,
left). Similarly, Figure 7 shows the performance of QA tasks unrelated to toxicity are hurt by toxicity ﬁltering,
though this may be due to the overall decrease in training data. Ultimately, the intended behaviour of the
model should inform the ﬁltering strategy, rather than one size ﬁts all. Most interesting of all, the strongest
performance on toxicity identiﬁcation for every dataset comes from the inverse toxicity ﬁlter. Practitioners
optimizing for performance on toxic domains should intentionally apply inverse ﬁlters.

Impact of Domain Composition on Pretrained Models
Section Findings
• Inclusion of Common Crawl, OpenWeb and Books have the strongest positive eﬀects on down-
stream performance. Data source heterogeneity is more important than data quality or size.
• Targeted data helps targeted evaluations, but not always as much as including heterogeneous web
domains.
• It is beneﬁcial to include as many pretraining data sources as possible.
As shown in Table 1, pretraining datasets seek to generalize to a wide array of downstream tasks by combining
data from a diverse set of domains. How does the choice of pretraining source domains impact downstream
performance? We empirically answer this question by ablating pretraining sources from the Pile one-at-a-time
and measuring the downstream performance change in 27 QA tasks from diverse domains.
We ﬁrst group the Pile data sources into nine domains representing conceptual sources that practitioners could
choose to license or scrape more of: Common Crawl (CC), OpenWeb, Wikipedia, Books, PubMed, Academic,
Code & Math, Legal, and Social (see Table 8). These are sorted in ascending order by size. We choose to
maintain the size disparities in these sources, simply because they reﬂect reality: curated Wikipedia content is
innately ﬁnite, while web and books are much more abundant. We then pretrain LM-XL with the full dataset
minus each category, yielding nine models, then ﬁnetune each for QA using Natural Questions. Finally, we
evaluate the model on 27 unique datasets from MRQA (Fisch et al., 2019) and UniﬁedQA (Khashabi et al.,
2020) that have also been partitioned into domains. Full details are documented in Appendix C.5.

Figure 8: QA tasks are aﬀected by removing domains when pretraining LM-XL. Each row represents a model with
one domain removed, the size of the remaining dataset is shown at the left in parentheses. Each column represents a
set of QA evaluations from a domain. The Full Dataset model represents the unﬁltered Pile LM-XL, and all scores are
relative to this Base model.
Common Crawl, OpenWeb, and Books have the strongest positive eﬀects on downstream performance.
Figure 8 shows that average downstream performance degrades the most when we remove web-based
domains like CC, Books, and OpenWeb, corroborating recent ﬁndings by Xie et al. (2023a). In particular,
these sources improve performance on challenging Common Sense and Contrast Sets tasks. While CC is the
largest chunk of text in the Pile, Books and OpenWeb are smaller but provide the most heterogeneous and
predicted-quality content (see Section 3). These results suggest that more data is not necessarily as important
a factor as a combination of heterogeneity and quality.
Domain heterogeneity is often more beneﬁcial than targeted data, even for targeted evaluations.
Ablat-
ing a pretraining domain has varying eﬀects on downstream QA performance. Predictably, performance
degrades when we remove domains with close alignment between the pretraining and downstream data
sources: removing PubMed hurts the BioMed QA evaluations, dropping Wikipedia hurts the Wikipedia
benchmarks, and removing web content hurts web evaluations. However, removing targeted domains
does not necessarily have as signiﬁcant an eﬀect on related downstream domains as removing the large
heterogeneous domains. For instance, removing CC from the pretraining dataset reduces performance
on downstream Academic QA tasks to a much greater extent than removing the Academic domain. Our
hypothesis is that CC, OpenWeb and Books contain extensive coverage of many topics, so removing the
Academic-speciﬁc category of sources does not remove all relevant academic information.
The best performing models use all the pretraining data sources.
Despite the importance of data hetero-
geneity, the best mean performance still comes from models that train on all, or nearly all, the data. The
exceptions are the removal of targeted source domains like the Pile’s Code or Academic (advanced science
and math journals) domains. These are both large but perhaps not well matched with the QA evaluation sets,
which do not require coding skills or scientiﬁc rigour beyond that found on Wikipedia and from web-based
sources. This ﬁnding suggests that both the quantity and diversity of open source data remain a bottleneck
for current pretraining methods.
Web and Books domains cause the biggest trade-oﬀbetween toxic identiﬁcation and generation.
We
next consider whether reducing a model’s pretraining exposure to toxic content aﬀects either its propensity
to generate toxic language or its ability to identify toxic language. Table 3 shows that the largest decreases
in both toxicity generation and identiﬁcation were caused by removing CC (26.9% of the data), OpenWeb
(6.9%), and Books (6.9%). This is consistent with the observation that Web and Books data had the highest

CommonCrawl and OpenWeb lead to the greatest decrease in toxicity metrics. Removing Wikipedia had
a strong increase in toxicity generation.

QA (Section 6) and toxicity identiﬁcation comes at the cost of more toxic generation.

Discussion
Guided by intuition: undocumented & unknown
Pretraining dataset curation has been guided by intu-
itions: collections should be large, diverse, and high quality. Decisions are often driven by the need for
something “good enough” or by precedents that may themselves not have been thoroughly evaluated (Sam-
basivan et al., 2021). Similarly, model developers occasionally neglect to share empirical insights, maintaining
a knowledge gap, often referred to as “documentation debt” (Bandy and Vincent, 2021).
Our results show that choices made in pretraining curation aﬀect models in signiﬁcant ways that cannot be
easily erased by subsequent ﬁnetuning. We urge both model producers and model users to think of dataset
curation policies as a form of hyperparameter, much like learning rates or network dimensions. Exhaustive
search methods that work for single scalar values will not, however, scale to curation policies that aﬀect
terabytes of data. While our results are necessary to establish that pretraining curation matters, they are
not suﬃcient to answer all questions. In this section we therefore make speciﬁc recommendations, but our
primary result is that we need better tools for modeling the relationship between data and model capabilities.
Age of the pretraining corpus.
In an ideal world, models would be continuously re-trained on the most
up-to-date data available. However, given the expense of data collection and re-training, model creators must
make a choice between eﬃciency and model staleness. More subtly, we also ﬁnd that using newer data can
add a “presentist” bias when evaluating retrospective tasks. The eﬀect of staleness is not overcome even by
plentiful ﬁnetuning data for the given task, and this eﬀect is worse for the larger, more capable models. This
result complements ﬁndings by Schulman (2023) that ﬁnetuning on newer data can aggravate hallucination
for new data that is not well-grounded at pretraining time. These tentative ﬁndings suggest the temporal
properties of pretraining corpora are increasingly essential to consider for larger models, for more novel tasks
(less ﬁnetuning data), and for instruction tuning models. Current practice includes augmenting prompts
with retrieved, recent data to help overcome stale pretraining data. While this can conceivably help mitigate
staleness, retrieving relevant text is a challenge in its own right.
We recommend model creators report the temporal distribution of pretraining data, which is not currently
standard practice (Hoﬀmann et al., 2022; Thoppilan et al., 2022; Anthropic AI, 2023; Cohere AI, 2023). Users
should be able to predict otherwise unforeseen performance degradations on much newer datasets, or be
aware of the potential side eﬀects of ﬁnetuning models on information not covered in pretraining.
15

Data source composition.
Decisions on the composition of a corpus intended for pretraining can have
substantial impacts on downstream performance. Of the two corpora we consider in this paper, C4 contains
only one data source, a single scrape of the Common Crawl, while the Pile is a collection of 22 data sources.
It is more complex and costly to assemble a corpus which contains diverse sources, writing styles, and
thematic areas. Achieving this diversity might also leave models vulnerable to less careful curation or gaps
in practitioner knowledge.
In our experiments, we ablate the Pile by systematically omitting each of its constituent datasets before
pretraining, and then measuring the impact on standard benchmarks. Our results suggest that practitioners
should not omit any data sources if generalization to as many text-to-text tasks is the goal, and that future
work should focus on collecting more diverse web and books content, which yield the largest beneﬁts. These
ﬁndings are somewhat consistent with hypotheses that the volume of training data remains a limiting factor,
especially given licensing constraints (Nostalgebraist, 2022).
Filtering for toxicity and quality.
The Common Crawl contains an enormous amount of low quality
(advertisements, repetitive, non-human-readable, etc.) and toxic text. Many state-of-the-art language models
ﬁlter out this text before training, either using bad words lists (Raﬀel et al., 2020), heuristics, or classiﬁers
(Du et al., 2022; Brown et al., 2020; Chowdhery et al., 2022). Deciding on how much and what kind of text to
ﬁlter out requires non-trivial normative decisions, and all of these ﬁltering approaches involve the model
creator intentionally modifying the bias of their datasets and thus their models.
In our experiments, we expose an implicit trade-oﬀbetween a model’s generalization abilities and its tendency
to generate toxic content. This behavior is modulated by quality and toxicity ﬁlters. In fact, over-sampling on
more toxic documents leads to the best performance on toxic identiﬁcation. This observation, coupled with ev-
idence that recent work is using post-hoc methods to curb unwanted toxic generation (e.g. instruction tuning
(Chung et al., 2022) or steerable decoders (Dathathri et al., 2020; Welbl et al., 2021)), suggests practitioners
should prioritize toxic identiﬁcation rather than curbing toxic generation abilities during pretraining.
We ﬁnd that our quality ﬁlter (the same used by PaLM, trained to keep content resembling Wikipedia and
Books) signiﬁcantly improves performance across domains, despite removing large portions of the training
data. Perplexingly, the Books domain is the one exception to the above observation, as its content ranks
among the highest quality. In general, observational quality characteristics of the data are not suﬃcient to
predict which domains will beneﬁt most from quality ﬁltering. Our analysis suggests that performance on a
task/domain is not inﬂuenced only by how much poor quality data (i.e. that which is unlike Wikipedia/Books)
is removed, but also by other aspects of quality, such as how much of the highest or mid-quality data is
represented along this speciﬁc measurement dimension.

Limitations
Compute Expense & Single Shot Experiments
To our knowledge, this is the largest publicly documented
LM pretraining experiment, spanning 28 1.5B parameter models—larger in experiment scope than Chinchilla
(Hoﬀmann et al., 2022) and also model scale than miniBertas (Warstadt et al., 2020), MultiBerts (Sellam
et al., 2022), Pythia (Biderman et al., 2023). It is important to acknowledge each of these pretrainings, with
their corresponding ﬁnetuning and evaluations is computationally and environmentally costly. With this
in mind, we made the careful decision on what experiments to pursue—narrowing our list to: age of the
corpora, quality ﬁlters, toxicity ﬁlters, and the choice of source domains. We carefully curated the choice of
experiments in advance, without the luxury of multiple rounds of reﬂection and repetition, common in many
NLP experimental settings. As a result, we struck a balance as best we could between the computational
costs, and reproducible validity. We hope to justify the merits of our selection and also point out the surprises
that motivate future work or a deeper look into the results.
Blackbox APIs
An additional limitation is our use of Perspective’s API for evaluating the toxicity of
generations. While most of our toxicity ﬁlters and evaluations were in a compressed time period, Pozzobon
et al. (2023) have since demonstrated the irreproducibility of black-box APIs, which may have shifting
implementations over time. We also believe that while this is the standard procedure for popular toxic
16

generation benchmarks like RealToxicityPrompts, the reliance on APIs and narrow evaluation setting can
have limited implications for toxic generation in real applications. For the time being, these are the best
proxies we have.
Relevance to Zero- & Few-Shot Prompted Settings
Our experiments focus on ﬁnetuned settings rather
than zero- or few-shot prompting. This choice is motivated by ﬁnetuning being more applicable for 1.5B
parameter models and also in many applied settings. We cannot establish how well these ﬁndings translate
to prompted settings (without ﬁnetuning), but suspect they are strong correlated.

Related Work
Pretraining Dataset Curation
There have been dozens of general-purpose models trained for natural
language understanding and generation tasks. Early models in this space, such as ELMO (Peters et al., 2018),
BERT (Devlin et al., 2019), and BERT’s various descendants (Liu et al., 2019; Lan et al., 2020), focused on
strong ﬁnetuning performance for a variety of natural language inference tasks, as well as semantically
meaningful language embeddings. These systems were trained on semi-curated datasets such as Wikipedia,
BookCorpus (Zhu et al., 2015), and news articles from the One Billion Word Benchmark (Chelba et al., 2013).
XLNet (Yang et al., 2019) broke away from this use of curated datasets to include documents from Common
Crawl into their pretraining dataset. T5 (Raﬀel et al., 2020), which introduced the C4 dataset, was one of the
ﬁrst pretrained language models to train exclusively on Common Crawl data. Multilingual versions of T5
(Xue et al., 2021) and BERT were trained on Common Crawl and Wikipedia, respectively.
GPT-2 was one of the ﬁrst models intended primarily for generation (Radford et al., 2019). Deeming Common
Crawl too noisy to be practical for training generative models, they developed WebText, a dataset containing
websites linked to from highly-ranked posts on Reddit. Subsequent generative models proposed mixing
large amounts of noisy Common Crawl data with smaller corpora perceived as high-quality. The GPT-Neo
model family (Black et al., 2022) trained on the Pile, which augments the Common Crawl with ArXiV, Stack
Exchange, legal documents, books, Github, and other more curated sourced (Gao et al., 2020). More recently,
OPT (Zhang et al., 2022) trained on the Pile augmented with social media data (Baumgartner et al., 2020),
and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023) trained on C4 augmented with Github, Stack Exchange, books, and
other sources. Pythia trained on the Pile, with and without duplication (Biderman et al., 2023). Finally, the
BLOOM model family (Scao et al., 2022) trained on the ROOTS Corpus, which crowd-sourced a collection of
“identiﬁed” datasets, coming from known, high-quality sources in a variety of languages.
All of the models mentioned so far are publicly available. However, companies are increasingly training their
best models on proprietary datasets, with only limited hints as to the data composition. At Alphabet, models
such as Gopher (Rae et al., 2021), GLaM (Du et al., 2022) , LaMDA (Thoppilan et al., 2022), and PaLM
(Chowdhery et al., 2022) have been trained on mixtures of web text, books, news, code, Wikipedia, and dialog
data. At OpenAI, GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) was trained on Common Crawl, WebText (GPT-2’s training
set), books, and Wikipedia. Subsequent versions of their model have also included code. Most of these
models have acknowledged using various forms of ﬁltering techniques to improve the quality of web-derived
training data. These include classiﬁers designed to exclude content which looks least like “high-quality”
sources such as books or Wikipedia (Chowdhery et al., 2022; Ouyang et al., 2022), using Google’s SafeSearch
for identifying toxic content (Rae et al., 2021), and various heuristics based on document length and the
presence or absence of certain words or characters.
Pretraining Dataset Analysis
Dodge et al. (2021) ﬁnd signiﬁcant amounts of low-quality patent, military,
and machine-generated text in C4, and a dearth of English text from American minority communities as well
as from non-Western communities like India or Nigeria post-ﬁltering, and so recommend against ﬁltering.
In contrast, Luccioni and Viviano (2021) recommend more robust ﬁltering practices to curb the signiﬁcant
presence of hate speech and sexually explicit content they ﬁnd in C4 even after ﬁltering. Similarly, Kreutzer
et al. (2022) ﬁnd that multilingual pretraining corpora are also dominated by low-quality text, particularly
for lower resource languages. Lastly, Lee et al. (2022) show the beneﬁts of deduplicating pretraining datasets,
which often contain a great deal of repeated content.
17

Data, Toxicity, & Quality
Research into the quality and toxicity of datasets and their resulting models has
seen mixed ﬁndings. All of the major models report using signiﬁcant data pre-processing and toxicity/quality
ﬁlters, including BERT, T5, BLOOM, OPT, ChinChilla, PaLM, LaMDA, and the GPT-3 series, with the largest
of these now using classiﬁers. This widespread adoption suggests there are signiﬁcant implicit beneﬁts, even
though they not often externally reported. GLaM does empirically report performance improvements from
ﬁltering, particularly on Natural Language Generation (NLG) tasks (Du et al., 2022).
However, in academia, a few works caution against the use of detoxiﬁcation techniques, including data
ﬁlters, which can reduce model perplexity on underrepresented communities (Xu et al., 2021; Welbl et al.,
2021). Welbl et al. (2021) also reports that a toxicity classiﬁer reduces toxicity more than than applying
data toxicity data ﬁlters, but Xu et al. (2021) show this yields the worst perplexity on underrepresented
communities. Meade et al. (2022) further corroborates that improvements on bias benchmarks correlates
with deteriorations in general language modeling abilities. Furthermore, investigating GPT-3’s described
quality ﬁlter, Gururangan et al. (2022) ﬁnd its quality judgments are unaligned with factuality or literary
acclaim but are instead aligned with some notion of langauge ideology more correlated with wealthier zip
codes. Works in the vision domain show data ﬁltering has important detoxiﬁcation beneﬁts but can reduce
performance (Nichol et al., 2022) or introduce other biases (Nichol, 2022). In summary, pretraining data
ﬁlters are ubiquitous in the development of non-toxic and high-quality models, but they are prone to reducing
their abilities to serve underrepresented communities and may introduce new biases.
Additional work has shown that instruction tuning (Chung et al., 2022; Longpre et al., 2023) and forms of
alignment tuning (Ouyang et al., 2022; Bai et al., 2022) have both reduced unwanted toxic generation.
Data & Time
Natural language is known to evolve and change over time (Altmann et al., 2009; Labov, 2011;
Eisenstein et al., 2014; Jaidka et al., 2018). As language’s distribution shifts, the ability of models to perform
well on new test sets has also been shown to degrade, due to their static knowledge of recent events, syntactic
and semantic practices (Lazaridou et al., 2021; Agarwal and Nenkova, 2022; Longpre et al., 2021). Luu et al.
(2021); Lazaridou et al. (2021); Liska et al. (2022); Yao et al. (2022); Zhang and Choi (2021); Jang et al. (2022)
oﬀer evaluation sets to measure this phenomena. Proposed remedies include ﬁnetuning on more recent data
(Luu et al., 2021), adaptive/continuous pretraining (Lazaridou et al., 2021; Röttger and Pierrehumbert, 2021),
data augmentation (Singh and Ortega, 2022), modeling text with its timpestamps (Dhingra et al., 2022). To
our knowledge, no work has thoroughly investigated the eﬀects of temporal degradation when pretraining
from scratch.
Data & Domains
The composition of public datasets, like C4 and the Pile, is guided mostly by licensing,
which severely restricts availability. Even so, Villalobos et al. (2022); Nostalgebraist (2022); Hoﬀmann
et al. (2022) suggest we are imminently exhausting high-quality text data on the web to train compute-
optimal larger LMs, at least with existing training eﬃciency. This poses a challenge, given the demonstrated
importance of high quality and diverse training data to strong generalization (Gao et al., 2020; Papadimitriou
and Jurafsky, 2020). A great deal of literature has dedicated itself to adapting static pretrained models to new
downstream domains, using domain adaptive pretraining (Gururangan et al., 2020), ﬁnding intermediate
ﬁnetuning tasks (Pruksachatkun et al., 2020), dynamically balancing data sources (Wang et al., 2020), data
selection (Iter and Grangier, 2021), augmentation (Longpre et al., 2019), and active learning (Longpre et al.,
2022). Another line of work demonstrates the potential of pretraining on carefully crafted synthetic data
(Wu et al., 2022).
Most similar to this section of our work, Xie et al. (2023a) re-balance mixtures of the Pile to achieve more
performant and eﬃcient convergence. Xie et al. (2023b) use importance sampling to select subsets of the Pile
most useful for target downstream tasks, in lieu of quality ﬁlters, to achieve 2% improvement on downstream
tasks. Pruksachatkun et al. (2020) systematically benchmark the eﬀects of intermediate ﬁnetuning tasks,
similar to how we benchmark diﬀerent compositions of pretraining tasks.
Model & Data Scaling
Prior work has explored scaling model size (Kaplan et al., 2020; Tay et al., 2022; Du
et al., 2022), the amount of pretraining data or the number of pretraining steps (Liu et al., 2019; Chowdhery
et al., 2022; Brown et al., 2020). Chinchilla investigated and reported optimal compute scaling laws, expressing
18

a relationship between model and data size (Nostalgebraist, 2022). Recent work has demonstrated that new
abilities emerge at greater scale (Wei et al., 2022), but also that many of these beneﬁts can be distilled or
compressed into smaller models (Taori et al., 2023; Movva et al., 2022). In this work, we investigate how
temporal pretraining misalignment varies on diﬀerent model sizes, which to our knowledge was previously
unanswered.

Conclusion
The relative age of documents, content ﬁlters, and data sources each have signiﬁcant eﬀects on downstream
model behaviour. These eﬀects can be reduced, but not eliminated, by ﬁnetuning. We recommend that model
developers and users pay close attention to these details in designing/selecting the model most relevant to
their needs, as each decision has a speciﬁc, quantiﬁable trade-oﬀproﬁle. For instance, it may be important to
decide between improving toxicity identiﬁcation or reducing toxic generation, performance on brand new or
older data sources, and biomedical or books text domains. These countless choices are inherent in curating
any pretraining dataset. While we are only able to evaluate a small fraction of these, we are able to show
which choices matter and by how much, and we hope to inspire further work evaluating dataset composition
and predicting behaviors of models given pretraining datasets.

Experimental Details
This section provides further details on the methodology and hyperparameter settings used for pretraining,
ﬁnetuning, and evaluation.
To allow for a model that can generate without ﬁnetuning but also perform well after ﬁnetuning, we rely
on the extensive experiments of Wang et al. (2022). Their empirical results suggest these criteria are met
with a Causal Decoding architecture with a Full Language Modeling pretraining objective (“CD-FLM”),
which permits generation without ﬁnetuning, followed by a Preﬁx Language Modeling objective (PLM) for
ﬁnetuning, where the causal attention mask is removed from the original prompt.
C.1
Pretraining Details
Our two pretraining datasets are C4 (Raﬀel et al., 2020) and the Pile (Gao et al., 2021). We use the same
vocabulary for both as used in the original T5 from Raﬀel et al. (2020). All training is conducted using T5X
(Roberts et al., 2022) and Tensorﬂow (Abadi et al., 2016) on TPUs. Speciﬁc hyperparameters for LM-XL and
LM-Small pretraining are detailed in Table 5.
C.2
Finetuning Details
Unless otherwise noted, evaluation was performed by ﬁnetuning on the train set for each benchmark task, and
then evaluating on either the validation or test set (speciﬁed in each section). Finetuning hyperparameters
are given in Table 6.
29

Toxicity Evaluation Details
In this section we describe the evaluation details for the results presented in Section 5.
Toxicity Identiﬁcation
For toxicity identiﬁcation evaluation, we ﬁnetune separately on each of the follow-
ing datasets: Social Bias Frames (SBF, Sap et al., 2020), DynaHate (DH, Vidgen et al., 2021), and Toxigen
(Hartvigsen et al., 2022). We then evaluate on their respective test sets, using AUC-ROC, which computes
the error rates over diﬀerent classiﬁcation thresholds. Note that each of these datasets has a slightly diﬀerent
version of toxicity they are evaluating for: biases and oﬀensive stereotypes implied in language for Social Bias
Frames, types of hateful speech like animosity, dehumanization, and derogation for DynaHate, and adversar-
ial, subtle and implicit forms of toxicity towards minority groups (e.g., stereotyping, microaggressions), for
Toxigen. We average over them to understand a model’s capabilities in identifying toxicity broadly.
Toxic Generation
For toxic generation, we do not do any ﬁnetuning. Instead, we evaluate how often each
model generates toxic continuations. To measure a model’s propensity to generate sexual, profane, or toxic
responses to a mix of benign and malicious inputs, we use prompts from the RealToxicityPrompts (Gehman
et al., 2020) dataset, as well as the prompt set developed to explore representational bias in PaLM (Chowdhery
et al., 2022).
30

For each model, we generate 25 responses per prompt, using top-k sampling (k = 40), with a temperature of
1.0. Following Chowdhery et al. (2022), we use the Perspective API to score responses, labeling those with a
toxicity score >= 0.5 as toxic. We compute the probability one of these generations per prompt is toxic, for
two evaluation splits, one with non-toxic inputs, and one with toxic inputs. The resulting evaluation metrics
are denoted RPT-T (for Toxic inputs) and RPT-NT (for Non-Toxic inputs).
The Representational Bias benchmark was constructed from the identity terms in (Rae et al., 2021) and
is described in more detail in Chowdhery et al. (2022). It uses templates constructed for several identity
markers, for which we use the subset related to gender, race, and religion. Following the practice with
RealToxicityPrompts, we sample 50 responses per prompt, use top-k sampling (k = 40, temperature = 1.0),
and then classify a response as toxic if Perspective API evaluates its toxicity score >= 0.5. We average
the toxicity rates per identity marker and per example to compute the overall RepBias score, where higher
indicates more toxic responses were produced on average. We also compute the 95% conﬁdence interval to
show where changes in mean are signiﬁcant.
C.4
Time Evaluation Details
This section describes the evaluation details for the results presented in Section 4. In applied settings, the
available training data (either for pretraining or ﬁnetuning) may be from diﬀerent years than the test-time
data. To mimic these situations, Luu et al. (2021) construct several datasets segmented by the year they
are collected from in order to measure the performance impact of diﬀerences in the time of collection of
ﬁnetuning and evaluation splits. As described in Section 2.3, we select 5 of the datasets that are shown to be
quite sensitive to these temporal misalignments, and that cover diﬀerent tasks and data sources. These tasks
are summarization, named entity recognition, classifying political aﬃliation, classifying academic topic, and
classifying the news source.
Due to the unique nature of each of these tasks in the temporal degradation experiments, we simply ﬁnetune
on each task individually, before evaluating on their respective test sets. For each dataset, we ﬁnetune using
4x4 TPUs with a batch size of 64, a maximum sequence length of 128, and we validate every 500 training
steps. We select the test set score with the highest validation accuracy across training. The best learning
rate and the total number of steps required to reach convergence varied by model and model size, and are
reported in Table 7. These hyperparameters are chosen based on initial experiments attempting to produce
stable learning curves which peak near the values observed in Luu et al. (2021).
Table 7: Time Dataset & Training Details: For each of the ﬁve datasets used to evaluate the model’s ability
over diﬀerent temporal periods, we report the learning rate and number of steps used in each model size.
These hyperparameters were chosen to ensure consistent convergence and stability within our infrastructure
settings.

We follow Luu et al. (2021)’s exact prescription in calculating Temporal Degradation (TD), as well as their
reported Pearson correlation measurements (r). Temporal degradation can be interpreted as the average rate
of deterioration in performance for a time period, measured in years. Since a temporal deterioration score is
calculated per evaluation year, we average over all evaluation years to compute a ﬁnal TD score for a dataset.
Furthermore, each dataset has a diﬀerent span of available training and evaluation years. To account for this,
we follow Luu et al. (2021) in presenting the Pearson correlation coeﬃcient, which presents the strenght of
31

the relationship between time diﬀerences and performance deterioration. We also replicate the Wald test
with null hypothesis that the slope is zero.
For evaluating the temporal degradation of pretraining, TDp, we modify Luu et al. (2021)’s original formula
to measure the diﬀerent D(t′ →t) where t′ is now the pretraining year. However, in this setting, performance
samples are represented with diﬀerent ﬁnetuning years. To account for this, we only compare the relative
performance changes of the pretraining year tp, against models with the same ﬁnetuning tf and evaluation
years te. In other words, given Stp→tf →te, we will only compare its performance to St′p→tf →te where t′
p ̸= tp,
but tf and te are ﬁxed to their respective values.
D(t′
p →te) = −(St′p→t′′
f →te −Stp→t′′
f →te) ∗sign(t′
p −te)
In some edge cases, there is no evaluation year equivalent to a pretraining year, ∀t ∈T, tp ̸= te, and so the
term Stp→t′′
f →te) does not exist. In this case, we set this term to be the one where tp and te are closest. And,
as before, the precise term used will depend on which version of tf is being calculated for.
C.5
Evaluating Domains with Question Answering Datasets
This section describes the evaluation details for the results presented in Section 6. These experiments involve
pretraining models with diﬀerent subsets of the corpora from the Pile (Gao et al., 2020) and seeing the eﬀects
on a variety of downstream evaluation domains, represented by question answering datasets. As such, we
are able to map the eﬀects of pretraining domains to evaluation domains.
First, we discuss the construction of the pretraining domains. We partition the Pile’s source datasets into
categories representing thematically similar sources of data, as seen in Table 8. We refer to these categories as
Domains. These domain partitions are subjective and cannot perfectly separate out text into these categories.
For instance, Wikipedia, Books, and Common Crawl data inevitably contain some Academic information,
but overall these partitions represent distinct features (see Section 3) that we have attempted to delineate by
areas of interest to practitioners and researchers. Prior work has attempted to measure, emphasize, or target
(either for inclusion or exclusion) the particular categories of data we’ve used in our partitions, such as more
books and structured data (Brown et al., 2020; Chowdhery et al., 2022), code data (Chen et al., 2021), and
legal data (Dodge et al., 2021), among others.
The Domains of the Pile were then each separately ablated from pretraining to understand the eﬀect of their
absence. To evaluate their absence on the performance of downstream domains, we chose to use the question
answering task expressly because there is a wide variety of similarly formatted evaluation datasets available.
For these question answering datasets we train only on Natural Questions (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019), a
popular QA dataset, to teach the model the general task. For evaluation, as described in Section 2.3, we use
UniﬁedQA (Khashabi et al., 2020) and MRQA (Fisch et al., 2019)’s collection of datasets to evaluate how
each pretrained model performs on a given “domain”, or set of datasets with similar source characteristics.
We partition the question answering datasets from UniﬁedQA and MRQA into ﬁve categories. Datasets with
Wikipedia documents represented in their collection are assigned to the Wiki category, datasets with scraped
web documents or news are assigned to the Web category, and so on. Datasets may belong to multiple
categories, depending on how they were constructed. The question answering evaluation partitions are
shown in Table 9. Finally, we evaluate on each question answering dataset and report the average F1 score
for each category.
32

Table 8: Partitions of the Pile’s Data Sources into Domains The Pile contains 22 distinct sources of data,
which we manually partition into 9 thematically similar domain clusters.

Impact of Data Curation on Data Composition: Further Analysis
D.1
Feature Deﬁnitions
As discussed in Section 3, we calculated a set of features across all datapoints to better understand the
distribution shifts for each ablation. The full list of features is as follows:
• Profanity, Toxicity, and Sexually Explicit The Perspective API classiﬁes text as violating or passing
each of these categories, as described in Section 2.2.
• Text Quality The same bag-of-words-based linear classiﬁer as used in PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022)
and GLaM (Du et al., 2022), is used to distinguish between text that looks like Wikipedia and books
from other text, as described in Section 2.2.
• Personally Identiﬁable Information (PII) A basic classiﬁer, similar to Google Cloud NLP (2023a),
detects the presence of four categories of personally identiﬁable information: names, phone numbers,
addresses, and emails.
• Readability The Flesch–Kincaid readability test (Kincaid et al., 1975) is applied to each document,
assigning documents a grade level based on the number of words per sentence and number of syllables
per word.
• Average Word Length Measured in characters.
• Document Length Measured in characters.
• Non-ASCII Characters Measured as a percentage of all characters in the document.
• All-caps Words Measured as a percentage of all words in the document.
• Type-Token Ratio A measure of the lexical diversity, or the ratio of unique tokens to total tokens
(Bender, 2013).
• Sentiment The score assigned by a classiﬁer similar to Google Cloud NLP (2023b), evaluating the
overall sentiment of the text along a spectrum from positive to negative.
Temporal information in pretraining data
While we collected versions of C4 at four diﬀerent years, each
of these versions may also contain data from prior years. We estimate the temporal information in the
pretraining data by counting instances of dates from 2000 to 2025 in each corpus. We do see that there are
many mentions of the year of collection, with a quick dropoﬀof about 5 years earlier (see Figure 10). This is
necessarily a limited experiment as an article written in 2016 may still mention something occurring in the
future in 2019. However, since website creation dates are not part of the web-scrape, we use this as a proxy to
estimate website creation dates.
D.2
Breakdown of the Quality Filter on Pile Domains
While the quality ﬁlters are typically applied to large, heterogeneous datasets such as C4, we also ran the
quality classiﬁer on the Pile to get a better understanding of what types of datapoints actually passed the
quality ﬁltering thresholds. The results are shown in Figure 11.

Experimental Results
In this section, we lay out the raw results for our toxicity, quality, and temporal degradation evaluations,
spanning several evaluation datasets.
E.1
Temporal Degradation Results
Luu et al. (2021) measure the temporal degradation due to ﬁnetuning and evaluation misalignment. Before
attempting to evaluate misalignment eﬀects speciﬁcally for pretraining, we mimic their ﬁnetuning experiments.
Figure 12 shows our results, which corroborate the ﬁndings of (Luu et al., 2021).

Figure 12: A replication of how temporal misalignment in ﬁnetuning aﬀects task performance (Luu et al., 2021).
In contrast to Figure 3, which shows the eﬀects of pretraining misalignment, this ﬁgure focuses on the more well
established eﬀect of ﬁnetuning misalignment.
Next we share the original evaluation results from which we computed the temporal degradation values
for both ﬁnetuning and pretraining. These contain a cross-section of the scores produced using a given
pretraining year (y-axis), ﬁnetuning year(s) (y-axis), for an evaluation year (x-axis). These results, Tables 10
to 13, are provided for both LM-XL and LM-Small, for comparison.

Toxicity & Quality Filtering Results
We also provide full results for our experiments with toxicity and quality ﬁlters, presented in Section 5. The
evaluation results of the models with toxicity ﬁlters applied to their data are visualized in Figure 5 (left) and
Figure 13, with full details in Table 14. The evaluation results of the models with quality ﬁlters applied to
their data are visualized in Figure 5 (right) and detailed in Table 15.
