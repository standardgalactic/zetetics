Kaluza–Klein Theory
Daniela Wuensch
Theodor Kaluza (1885–1954) set forth his idea of unifying gravitation and elec-
tromagnetism within ﬁve-dimensional space-time in a paper from the beginning
of 1919. It was presented by Albert Einstein (1879–1955) to the Berlin Academy
of Science and published in its Sitzungsberichte in 1921 under the title “Zum
Unit¨atsproblem der Physik” [4]. Having received the manuscript from the author
in April 1919, Einstein was so impressed with the idea of unifying the basic forces
in a ﬁve-dimensional space that he used it himself up to the mid-1940s in eight of
his own papers.
Kaluza’s idea of unifying gravitation and electromagnetism goes back to David
Hilbert’s (1862–1943) uniﬁcation program and to the pioneering work of two
of his pupils: Hilbert sought uniﬁcation within a four-dimensional space by
having electromagnetism come from gravitation in 1915 [2]. His pupil Gunnar
Nordstr¨om (1881–1923) explored uniﬁcation within a ﬁve-dimensional unwarped
(Minkowskian) space in the foregoing year [7]. The uniﬁcation attempt by Hermann
Weyl (1885–1955) in 1918, ﬁnally, was to apply a gauge transformation within a
four-dimensional space with a generalized non-Riemannian metric [10]. Although
Nordstr¨om was the ﬁrst to introduce a ﬁve-dimensional space, it was Kaluza’s
theory from 1919 that proposed a realistic uniﬁcation of the two interactions. Nord-
str¨om’s theory predated the general theory of relativity (1915) so the gravitation
was derived from electromagnetism within a space described by a Minkowskian ﬂat
metric. As a consequence, it could not explain phenomena like light deﬂection and
was therefore condemned as a prerelativistic theory.
Kaluza’s idea, which was to serve as the model for the design of all uniﬁed theo-
ries in higher-dimensional spaces, was as follows: Within a ﬁve-dimensional space
(with a Riemannian metric) there exists a unique ﬁve-dimensional gravitational
force that upon projection onto the four-dimensional space of our experience splits
into two phenomena: our familiar natural forces, being four-dimensional Einsteinian
gravitation (known from the general theory of relativity), and Maxwellian elec-
tromagnetism. Thus in Kaluza’s theory – as in all modern higher-dimensional
uniﬁed theories, and unlike Nordstr¨om’s – the fundamental force is gravitation. It,
according to Kaluza, is the originator of electromagnetism. (Modern-day higher-
dimensional uniﬁed theories attribute all the other forces to gravitation as well.)
Electromagnetism is thus an effect of the ﬁfth dimension. The ﬁfth components of
the metric tensor gμ5(μ = 1, 2, 3, 4) are identical to the Maxwellian electromag-
netic ﬁeld Aμ. Kaluza was able to show that the ﬁve-dimensional momentum p5

is proportional to the electric charge ρ0, which offers a possible explanation for
electric charge as a ﬁve-dimensional effect.
Kaluza applied his “cylinder condition” in order to explain why the ﬁfth dimen-
sion is not perceptible in any phenomena of our experience. It states that the ﬁrst
derivative of all physical quantities after the ﬁfth dimension must be null:
∂f (x)
∂x5
= 0
This condition determines the structure of the ﬁve-dimensional Kaluza space, in that
the ﬁfth dimension forms the cylinder’s central axis. The points on the cylinder’s sur-
face correspondingly make up our familiar four-dimensional space. Einstein found
fault with this preference for the ﬁfth dimension because it limits the covariance
within ﬁve-dimensional space. He also argued for a then radical conception of ﬁeld
theory that makes all particles interpretable as condensations of a ﬁeld. Kaluza’s the-
ory should, he thought, yield the  electron as a product of its uniﬁed ﬁeld, which
was not the case.
In 1926 Oskar Klein (1894–1977) succeeded in linking Kaluza’s theory [4] with
quantum mechanics [5,6]. He quantiﬁed the ﬁfth components of momentum accord-
ing to the rule:
p5 = n × h
l
(n = quantum number, h =  Planck’s constant, l = period of the ﬁfth dimension,
i.e., the circumference of a tiny circle).
It differed from Kaluza’s theory in the following way [12]: Instead of having the
ﬁfth dimension form the central axis of a cylinder of inﬁnite extension, Klein had it
curled up (“compactiﬁed”) into a tiny circle of magnitude l = 10−30 cm.
l = hc
√
2k
e
(c = velocity of light, e = electron charge, k = Einstein’s gravitational constant)
The term “Kaluza–Klein theory” was ﬁrst used in 1933 by Oswald Veblen (1880–
1960) [9], who together with Banesh Hoffmann (1906–1986) had given the theory
its projective form in 1930 [3]. The theory became a purely formal construct in
which the ﬁve-dimensional space is no longer attributed any physical reality. It
serves instead as a mathematical space from which the real four-dimensional space
emerges as a projection. Pascual Jordan (1902–1980) and Andr´e Lichnerowicz
(1915–1998) were among the proponents of this construct from 1945 on.
Wolfgang Pauli (1900–1958) and others working on quantum mechanics rejected
the ﬁve-dimensional Kaluza–Klein theory in the mid-1930s, however, because it
offered no way to quantify ﬁeld theories [13].
Two new interactions were discovered during the 1930s, the weak and the strong
interactions. Gauge theories – an idea Hermann Weyl originally developed in 1918
and generalized in 1929 – were the ﬁrst to prove successful in unifying the three
natural forces: electromagnetism, the weak and strong forces, by means of common
symmetry properties.

Kaluza–Klein Theory
In the continued search for a new theory to unify all four natural forces, the
Kaluza–Klein theory was rediscovered in the 1960s. Bryce S. DeWitt (1923–2004)
came up with the idea of combining the  symmetry transformation contained in
gauge theories with the higher-dimensionality of physical space in the Kaluza–Klein
theory in 1963 [1].
Three advocates of superstring theory: In 1975, J. Scherk (1946–1979), together
with H. J. Schwarz (born in 1941), E. Crammer (born in 1942) and J. Scherk (in
1976) and in 1976 E. Crammer (born in 1942) together with J. Scherk introduced the
idea that the higher dimensions should be regarded as true physical dimensions “on a
par with the four observed dimensions.” [11, p. 412] They suggested that the obvious
differences between the four observed dimensions and the extra microscopic ones
could arise from a spontaneous breakdown in the vacuum symmetry, i.e., from a
process of ‘spontaneous compactiﬁcation’ of the extra dimensions (curling up as
the universe cooled).
At the beginning of the 1980s the initiator of the superstring revolution, Edward
Witten (born in 1951), explored in his article “Search for a Realistic Kaluza–Klein-
Theory” (1981) [11] whether the theory could serve as a conceptual basis for the
uniﬁcation of all the natural forces. “This theory,” he exclaimed, “is surely one of
the most remarkable ideas ever advanced for uniﬁcation of electromagnetism and
gravitation” [11, p. 415]. Thus Kaluza–Klein theories began to be considered as the
potential beginning of a paradigm shift.
Kaluza–Klein theories still serve as a model for superstring theory as well as
for the M-theory propounded by Edward Witten in 1995 which endows space
with eleven dimensions. It is based on Kaluza’s idea that apparently different
natural forces may be uniﬁed by introducing additional spatial dimensions, with
the unifying force being higher-dimensional gravitation. It also takes up Klein’s
idea of compactifying additional dimensions and explains why the additional di-
mensions are not perceptible: Their extremely small size makes them technically
immeasurable.
Lisa Randall (born in 1962) and Raman Sundrum (born in 1964) developed a new
form of uniﬁcation in 1999 that does not use the Kaluza–Klein model but reverts
back to Kaluza’s original idea of a ﬁfth dimension of inﬁnite extension [6].

Kochen–Specker Theorem
Carsten Held
Quantum mechanics generates, for chosen  observables and state assignments,
measurement outcome predictions. What does it mean to ask whether the theory
completely describes the systems it in fact describes? Assume that, if a quantum-
mechanical system S is in a pure state |a1⟩such that prob (a1) = 1 (i.e., the
probability that S is found, upon an A-measurement, to have a1 equals 1), then it
has the physical property represented by a1 (the eigenvalue of A pertaining to |a1⟩).
Completeness then can be characterized as the idea that the properties ascribed to S
in this way are the only ones and incompleteness as the idea that there are more. The
possible S properties not derivable from S’s quantum-mechanical state are usually
called  hidden variables.
Incompleteness (i.e., the presence of hidden variables) can be related to S’s
description in  Hilbert space H as follows. In every orthogonal set of vectors
spanning H and thus representing a non-degenerate observable, there is one vec-
tor representing a possessed property and thus being ascribed the number 1, the
others the number 0. We now ask the question whether such an assignment (repre-
senting incompleteness) is possible. This is a mathematical problem that turns out
to be reducible to the Hilbert space R3 (the familiar three-dimensional space over
the real numbers) and for this space to the task of assigning the number 1 to exactly
one vector, in any  orthonormal basis (the number 0 to the two others), under the
condition that vectors of different bases but lying in the same ray get assigned the
same number. Call such an assignment a 0–1 valuation.
