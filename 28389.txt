unpublished studies; data on body weights and fecundity were taken from ref.
13. All variables were log-transformed before analysis and where several
estimates of density were available I used the mean of the log-transformed
values. Data on population density were available for 81 species of the total of
161.
The phylogeny used in this analysis was based on a major synthesis14 of
DNA-hybridization studies of Australian marsupials. This phylogeny resolves
the relationships of most genera and some subgeneric groupings, and provides
estimates of age for each node. Relationships among species within genera, and
the positions of genera not included in ref. 14, were taken from refs 15–24. I
used the CAIC program25 to calculate phylogenetically independent contrasts
in the variables of interest. This program implements Pagel’s version of
Felsenstein’s method26,27 to remove the non-independence due to phylogenetic
association from relationships between variables measured on species. This
analysis requires information on branch lengths, which was not available for
many of the branches in the phylogeny I used. In the absence of such
information, CAIC offers two default assumptions: all branch lengths may be
set equal (this is equivalent to assuming a punctuational mode of evolution) or
branch lengths may be assigned on the assumption that the ages of taxa are in
direct proportion to the number of species they contain. All analyses were
repeated using both assumptions, but this made no signiﬁcant difference to the
results. For the analyses presented here I assumed equal branch lengths.
The cut-off between recent and ancient marsupials was set at 4 million years
because this is approximately twice the mean species lifespan for mammals28.
This meant that beyond 4 million years ago, differential extinction could be
expected to have a major structuring effect on mammalian assemblages. I was
forced to use a cut-off rather than treat age as a continuous variable because the
divergence dates for many species were not known precisely, but these species
could be placed into one or other of the age categories on the basis of their
position relative to nodes of known age. Those species that could be placed into
one or other of the categories were as follows.
Recent species: all species of Isoodon, Macropus, Petrogale, Trichosurus and
Lasiorhinus, Petaurus gracilis, P. norfolcensis, Thylogale thetis, T. stigmatica, and
Pseudochirulus cinereus. Within this group, analysis by independent contrasts
was completed only to nodes of age 4 million years or less.
Ancient species: Acrobates pygmaeus, Aepyprymnus rufescens, Burramys
parvus, Gymnobelideus leadbeateri, Hemibelideus lemuroides, Hypsipyrmnodon
moschatus, Lagostrophus fasciatus, Myrmecobius fasciatus, Petauroides volans,
Petropseudes
dahli,
Phascolarctos
cinereus,
Pseudocheirus
peregrinus,
P.
occidentalis, Setonix brachyurus, Tarsipes rostratus, Vombatus ursinus and
Wyulda squamicaudata. A date for the divergence of Pseudocheirus peregrinus
and P. occidentalis was not available, but was assumed to be ancient because of
the early separation of forested habitat in southeastern and southwestern
Australia, and the fact that Pseudocheirus is thought to have diverged from the
Pseudochirulus group of ringtail possums more than 20 million years ago14.
To test the sensitivity of the analysis to the position of the cut-off, I re-
analysed the data using a cut-off of 10 million years to distinguish ancient and
recent species, but the correlations produced by this re-analysis (r ¼ 0:55,
n ¼ 35, P , 0:001 for recent taxa and r ¼ 2 0:82, n ¼ 10, P , 0:01 for ancient
taxa) did not substantively alter the result shown in Fig. 1.

Reading words and naming pictures involves the association of
visual stimuli with phonological and semantic knowledge.
Damage to a region of the brain in the left basal posterior
temporal lobe (BA37), which is strategically situated between
the visual cortex and the more anterior temporal cortex, leads to
reading and naming deﬁcits1,2. Additional evidence implicating
this region in linguistic processing comes from functional neuro-
imaging studies of reading in normal subjects3–7 and subjects with
developmental dyslexia8,9. Here we test whether the visual com-
ponent of reading is essential for activation of BA37 by comparing
cortical activations elicited by word processing in congenitally
blind, late-blind and sighted subjects using functional neuro-
imaging. Despite the different modalities used (visual and tactile),
all groups of subjects showed a common activation of BA37 by
words relative to non-word letter-strings. These ﬁndings agree
with the proposal that BA37 is an association area that integrates
converging inputs from many regions10. Our study conﬁrms a
prediction of theories of brain function that depend on conver-
gence zones; the absence of one input (that is, visual) does not
alter the response properties of such a convergence region.
Studies of non-human primates have shown that object and
spatial processing are dissociated into interconnected but distinct
visual pathways. Visual object processing, including processing of
letters and words11,12, is mainly subserved by ventral areas compris-
ing the occipital and inferior temporal cortex. This specialization
within the human cortex has been shown by direct cortical
recordings13, stimulation14,15, functional imaging6, and lesion

studies2,16. Ventral regions may also be further specialized for
processing faces, coloured objects, and letters13,17,18. Posterior (occi-
pital) regions are activated equally by visual words and letter-
strings, whereas more anterior (temporal) regions respond only to
words13. This has led to the idea that there are successive processing
stages within the ventral visual pathway that are concerned with
increasingly higher-order characteristics of word or word-like
stimuli.
Here we investigated what happens when, because of blindness,
language acquisition is restricted to tactile and auditory experience
and reading is achieved through the Braille system. Our critical
question was: does tactile reading use the same neuronal systems as
visual linguistic processing in subjects who have never been exposed
to visual words or objects, or does it involve somatosensory
association areas (that is, the parietal cortex)? We consider con-
genital blindness to be a model in which the normal sensory
determinants of neurodevelopment in the language system have
been perturbed. In a similar sense, late blindness can be seen as a
model for a system that is neurodevelopmentally normal but which
has subsequently undergone equivalent disruption of normal sen-
sory input relevant to reading.
Early blindness has been shown to lead to crossmodal sensory
reorganization, indexed by striate19 and extrastriate19,20 responses to
tactile stimuli. We studied higher-order linguistic processing by
comparing responses to words and letter-strings within the same
modality (tactile or visual). We used a multifactorial positron
emission tomography (PET) design, and involved sighted as well
as congenitally and late-blind subjects. Subjects were presented with
words or non-word letter-strings while they were engaged in an
incidental feature-detection task (see Methods). Half the word
conditions contained concrete nouns (for example, ‘apple’) and
the other half contained abstract nouns with low imageability (for
example, ‘justice’). The stimuli were presented visually to sighted
subjects and in the form of Braille to blind subjects.
Activations related to words contrasted with letter-strings were
remarkably similar for sighted, late-blind and congenitally blind
subjects (Fig. 1), with the greatest activation being expressed in the
left posterior basal temporal lobe (BA37) and another activation
occurring in the left frontal operculum. A conjunction analysis (see
Methods) identiﬁed these areas to be signiﬁcant in all three groups,
in the absence of any signiﬁcant interaction (that is, there were no
differential activations among the groups; Fig. 1d)5. Concrete and
abstract words produced equivalent activation, showing that
responses in BA37 are not restricted to words depicting objects.
These results (Fig. 1a) replicate those found for sighted subjects in a
similar implicit reading task3 and in explicit reading tasks4–7.
Many studies have shown the modality-independent nature of
the frontal operculum21. Here we focus on the tactile activations of
BA37 because this region has been primarily implicated in visual
processing22,3. Figure 2 shows the location of the BA37 activation
relative to the posterior region (BA19) that responds nonspeciﬁcally
to visual or tactile stimuli (relative to resting conditions19 or to an

auditory baseline20). The more anterior, BA37 response (Fig. 2) is
word-speciﬁc. This anterior/posterior dissociation for word-speci-
ﬁc (anterior) and nonspeciﬁc (posterior) responses along the fusi-
form gyrus conﬁrms ﬁndings from direct cortical recordings13.
However, the anterior area, activated by all subject groups repre-
sents only a small portion within BA37, illustrating the functional
diversity of this association area.
Late-blind and sighted subjects showed nearly identical activa-
tion patterns (Fig. 1a, b). This similarity may reﬂect the fact that the
late-blind subjects developed visual reading skills before the onset of
blindness, and is consistent with the existence of an established
visual reading system that is subsequently recruited for tactile
reading. More surprising was the fact that we found activations in
the posterior basal temporal lobe of congenitally blind subjects (Fig.
1c), in whom this cortical system had never been engaged by visual
processing. Although human studies have emphasized the visual
properties of BA37 (refs 22, 23), our ﬁndings show that tactile
information is also processed in BA37. This multimodality concurs
with anatomical data about connectivity in precursor regions of
BA37 in the monkey; these data indicate convergence of auditory,
visual and tactile projections24.
The predominant deﬁcit after lesions of BA37 in humans are
alexia and (visual) anomia, but an associated tactile anomia has also
been reported1,25. The tactile deﬁcit in sighted subjects could be due
either to the fact that tactile information is intermediately trans-
formed into a visual representation23, which BA37 then integrates
with lexical information, or to the fact that BA37 directly integrates
tactile information with lexical information. Our data from con-
genitally blind subjects show that BA37 has multimodal properties
that integrate tactile inputs with linguistic knowledge even in the
absence of tactile–visual associations.
We can discount the possibility that the common basal temporal
lobe activations we found represent activations due to visual or
tactile imagery23 of objects depicted by the words, because half of the
words presented were abstract (for example, ‘justice’) and these
words produced the same posterior temporal responses as concrete
words (with no signiﬁcant difference in activation). This reasoning
is extended by the absence of any possible visual imagery and by
restrictions on tactile imagery (that is, object size) in congenitally
blind subjects.
In sighted children, language develops by the association of a
spoken word with visual information (for example, the picture of a
ball or later the visual word ‘ball’). Conversely, in congenitally blind
children it is the association of tactile input with the spoken word.
Therefore, although sighted and blind subjects have auditory
experience in common, they differ in the sensory input to which
they attach this phonological/auditory information. Our data show
that the tactile and auditory experience available to blind subjects is
sufﬁcient for BA37 to integrate sensory information with liguistic
knowledge.
Complementary evidence to support the hypotheses that parts of
BA37 are involved in linguistic processing comes from studies of
developmental dyslexia. In a neuroimaging study using the same
task paradigm, we showed that developmental dyslexics showed
reduced activation, compared with controls, in BA37 (ref. 8),
consistent with earlier functional imaging studies9. The adult
developmental dyslexic subjects had profound difﬁculties in learn-
ing to read despite (above) average intelligence, normal educational
opportunity, and absence of sensory impairment. Nevertheless,
their reading ability was well-compensated and they were able to
read the words as accurately and within the same time constraints as
normal control subjects. The reduced responses to words in BA37 in
these subjects shows the enduring effect of their developmental
disorder.
The activation of BA37 during reading3 and picture naming5
indicates BA37 may link internal knowledge with arbitrary symbols.
Is this link linguistic or prelinguistic? A patient with a small lesion in
BA37 (ref. 1) showed an isolated ‘phonological anomia’ with alexia,
suggesting a linguistic role for BA37. Patients with anomia and
alexia may fail to retrieve the name associated with an object or read
a word. At the same time, they can identify presented objects by
detailed verbal description and read words after naming letters
sequentially26, indicating intact conceptual knowledge27. The evi-
dence that BA37 links converging inputs suggest that this area may
not contain records of linguistic codes per se. BA37 may be an area
that promotes activity in other distributed sites that jointly give rise
to lexical or conceptual access (see also ref. 10). Such a region should
be resistant to major variations in sensory input characteristics10.
This prediction is conﬁrmed by our data, which show that BA37 is
activated when blind subjects read Braille.

Methods
PET scanning and data analysis. PET scans were acquired with an ECAT
EXACT HR+ scanning system (CTI Siemens) in three-dimensional mode. An
antecubital vein cannulawas used to administer 350 mBq of H15
2 O. We acquired
the data in one 90-s frame with about 8 min between scans. Images were
reconstructed by ﬁltered back projection into a 128 3 128 3 63 image matrix
(voxel size 2:1 3 2:1 3 2:4 mm) using measured attenuation correction. The
data were analysed with SPM96 (Wellcome Dept Cognitive Neurology; http://
www.ﬁl.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm). Images were realigned to correct for interscan
movements, co-registered with the subject’s structural magnetic resonance
image to allow overlaying of functional data on the subjects’ structural data,
and spatially normalized into the space deﬁned by the atlas of J. Talairach and P.
Tournoux to allow group analyses. The data were smoothed with a 16-mm
gaussian ﬁlter to account for residual intersubject differences. Statistical
parametric maps were derived with the appropriate contrasts of condition-
speciﬁc effects. The contrasts of interest in this study tested for the difference
between reading words and non-words for all three subject groups, thereby
revealing voxels in which the regional cerebral bloodﬂow was signiﬁcantly
higher during word reading compared with during non-word reading. These
voxel-based t-statistics are transformed to Z-statistics and assembled in a
statistical parametric map, SPM{Z}, that can be seen as an image of Z-statistics
for a single comparison. Statistical inference on the SPM{Z} was corrected for
multiple comparisons using the theory of gaussian ﬁelds28.
We report only activations reﬂecting differences between word and non-
word processing that were common to blind and sighted subjects. Signiﬁcant
interactions (that is, differences between groups) were found but are not
reported here. Our analysis were voxel-based and therefore not biased towards
any speciﬁc region of the brain.

stimuli. We
studied
six
sighted
subjects (mean
age
26:8 6 4 years), six congenitally blind, proﬁcient Braille readers (mean age
49:2 6 12 years), and three late-blind subjects (mean age of onset of blindness
18:3 6 3:8 years; mean age 45 6 7:6 years). Eight out of nine blind subjects read
with their right hand. One congenitally blind reader used both hands. The
causes of blindness in the congenital group were retinopathy of prematurity (2
of 6), optic nerve abnormalities (3 of 6) and congenital glaucoma (1 of 6). All
late-blind subjects experienced progressive visual impairment before complete
blindness. The initial pathology in the late-blind group comprised iridocyclitis,
trauma and microphthalmia with ensuing calcifying cataracts. The late-blind
subjects could read print before losing their sight and were matched in terms of
Braille reading to the congenitally blind group (ﬁnding subjects that meet these
criteria is difﬁcult, hence the small number of late-blind subjects). All blind
subjects had no light perception. All subjects were right-handed; one subject
was female. The study design was multifactorial, with three factors being
altered: modality (visual, tactile or aural), stimulus (word or non-word) and
imageability (high or low) within the word level of the previous factor.
Each subject underwent 12 scans, during which we presented either words or
non-words at a rate of one per 2.5 s. For the sighted group, visual stimuli were
presented on a computer monitor (5 degrees vertically with variable word
length horizontally) for 1 s. For the blind groups, six dot, non-contracted (one
Braille character per letter) Braille strings were presented on a PC-driven
electronic Braille display (ALVA, Netherlands) for 2.3 s. Non-words were strings
of consonants (for example, CDXSD). We chose to compare consonant letter-
strings to words instead of pseudowords (such as foop) because the face validity

of this comparison is easier to establish, especially for Braille readers about
whom there is little information on pseudoword processing.
Auditory stimuli had the same characteristics as the visual/tactile stimuli
except that the non-words were reversed words. During half of the word-
presentation conditions, we presented abstract words (low imageability 250–
400 (according to the Medical Research Council psycholinguistic database))
and concrete words (high imageability 550–700). The task in all conditions was
a feature-detection task involving incidental word processing as described
previously3. Targets were ascenders in the visual conditions (for example in the
letters l, d and t), one or more raised dot number 6 (the right lower dot) in the
Braille words, and a short tone in the auditory conditions. The use of implicit
processing allowed us to match attentional set between conditions and to
monitor performance. Words and non-words were matched for the number of
characters (5:6 6 1:3), syllables (1:7 6 0:5) and occurrences of targets (49%).
Responses were made by pressing a button with the thumb of the right hand.
The instructions were: ‘‘Read/listen to the word and if you ﬁnd/hear a target,
press the button’’. Target detection exceeded 85% in all groups. The mean
reaction time for visual/tactile presentation was 552 6 116 ms for the sighted
group, 1;605 6 281 ms for the congenitally blind group and 1;809 6 364 ms for
the late-blind group.

The potent analgesic effects of cannabis-like drugs1–4 and the
presence of CB1-type cannabinoid receptors in pain-processing
areas of the brain and spinal cord5,6 indicate that endogenous
cannabinoids such as anandamide7 may contribute to the control
of pain transmission within the central nervous system (CNS)8.
Here we show that anandamide attenuates the pain behaviour
produced by chemical damage to cutaneous tissue by interacting
with CB1-like cannabinoid receptors located outside the CNS.
Palmitylethanolamide (PEA), which is released together with
anandamide from a common phospholipid precursor9, exerts a
similar effect by activating peripheral CB2-like receptors. When
administered together, the two compounds act synergistically,
reducing pain responses 100-fold more potently than does each
compound alone. Gas-chromatography/mass-spectrometry mea-
surements indicate that the levels of anandamide and PEA in the
skin are enough to cause a tonic activation of local cannabinoid
receptors. In agreement with this possibility, the CB1 antagonist
SR141716A and the CB2 antagonist SR144528 prolong and
enhance the pain behaviour produced by tissue damage. These
results indicate that peripheral CB1-like and CB2-like receptors
participate in the intrinsic control of pain initiation and that
locally generated anandamide and PEA may mediate this effect.
Although pain perception is thought to be controlled mainly by
neurotransmitter systems that operate within the CNS10, antinoci-
ceptive (pain-relieving or -preventing) mechanisms also occur in
peripheral tissues. For example, endogenous opioid peptides
released from activated immune cells during inﬂammation inhibit
pain transmission by interacting with opioid receptors on periph-
eral sensory nerve endings11. To determine whether endogenous
cannabinoids have an analogous function to that of opioids, we
used the formalin test, a behavioural model of injury-induced acute
and tonic pain12. Injection of dilute formalin into the hind paws of
freely moving rodents evokes a pain behaviour consisting of two
temporally distinct phases of licking and ﬂexing of the injected
limb12. An early phase involving acute activation of pain-sensing C
ﬁbres13 begins immediately after formalin administration, reaches a
peak within 5 min, and then rapidly declines. After an interval of
10–15 min, a second phase of sustained pain behaviour appears, in
which sensory ﬁbre activity is accompanied by inﬂammation14 and
central sensitization15.

Time delays to the response were measured at certain times (in min) after intracerebroven-
tricular administration of vehicle (10% DMSO in saline, 5 ml), anandamide (AEA,10 mg), PEA
(10 mg) or anandamide plus PEA (10 mg each). Asterisk indicates P , 0:01 (n ¼ 6).
