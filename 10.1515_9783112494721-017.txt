A Self-Consistent Approximation

By 
V . JANIS 
A self-consistent approximation is given accounting for both, the dimensionality and lattice 
structure effects for the free energy of the Ising model in a quenched random magnetic field. 
The phase diagram for the bimodal distribution of the random field is displayed. 
Es wird eine selbstkonsistente Näherung für die freie Energie des Ising Modells in einem magneti-
schen Feld angegeben. Die Effekte der Dimension und der Struktur des Gitters werden be-
rücksichtigt und das Phasendiagramm für die bimodale Verteilung des zufälligen Feldes ange-
geben. 
1. Introduction 
The random-field Ising model (RFIM) is at present intensively studied both theoretic-
ally and experimentally, since its critical behaviour and the existence of long-range 
order (LRO) in low dimensions, particularly for d = 2,3, is not yet satisfactorily re-
solved (for a recent review see [1]). Continuous field theories using a perturbative re-
normalization of Feynman diagrams [2] and supersymmetric formulation [3] predict 
no transition to LRO for d <C. 4, while stability arguments balancing the volume and 
surface energies of oriented spin domains [4] lead to the existence of LRO for d ^ 3. 
The latter conclusion was supported by a rigorous result [5] concerning the zero-tem-
perature ground state and the domain wall theories [6]. Also experiments support the 
existence of LRO in the d = 3 RFIM [7]. 
Though the existence of LRO at low temperatures in three dimensions seems now 
to be confirmed both experimentally and theoretically, the critical behaviour of the 
RFIM for d = 3 is not yet understood properly [8]. Because of the existence of several 
local minima of the free energy of the RFIM, it is necessary to leave the continuous 
field theories giving only universal quantities. We must construct a direct approxima-
tion for the RFIM on a lattice to understand the global critical behaviour and to explain 
experimental data. At present, there exist several quantitative lattice approaches to 
the RFIM. Perturbative ones, using high-temperature expansions [9] cannot give all 
subtleties of the RFIM phase diagram. The mean-field approximation [10] can give the 
full phase diagram but, since it does not depend on dimensionality, it is believed to be 
valid for d > 4. 
In this paper we present an alternative self-consistent approximation based on 
a renormalized high-temperature expansion and utilizing ideas from the spectral theory 
of disordered crystals. This approximation to the RFIM free energy accounts non-
trivially for dimensionality and lattice structure effects and is applicable in the whole 
temperature and magnetic field scale. In a trivial case, it reduces to the mean field.

But in low dimensions, critical behaviour within this approximation is dominated by 
the on-site spin fluctuations and differs from the mean-field one. Here only the main 
points of the approach are given. The detailed analysis will be presented elsewhere 
2. Basic Equations 
The free energy of the ferromagnetic Ising model in a quenched random field can be 
written as

tice. <)ar means averaging with respect to the random field H1 distributed homogene-
ously without site correlations on the lattice. H° is a weak external magnetic field and 
s € <0, 1) is a new parameter minimizing (locally) the functional on the right-hand side 
of (1) and defining the magnetization of the ground state. 
We can replace the discrete-value spin variables st by continuous ones <pt by a Gaus-
sian transformation (that is applicable only when [i 
1 and J^ is a positive definite 
matrix!). The resulting functional integral in the auxiliary field (pi can be rearranged 
into the form suitable for a high-temperature expansion for the free energy [11]: 
F({H'},

where H\ = £ {Jp1)^ Hj and N is the number of lattice sites.

A series expansion for F is obtained, when the exponential with functional derivatives 
is expanded into powers of JjkBT. 
This series can be represented diagrammatically. 
An internal solid line represents J^jk^T 
(i =(= j) and an internal »-tuple vertex cor-
responds to

where 3€n is Hermite polynomial, the internal brackets mean the normalized integration 
over (ft from (2) and the superscript c denotes cumulants. The dashed line stands for 
common averaging with respect to the random magnetic field represented by cumulant 
products of connected vertices. The susceptibility diagrams of this expansion are par-
allel to the "locator" expansion for the Green function from the spectral theory of elec-
trons in a disordered crystal [12], where efficient methods, in the vein of the coherent

potential approximation (CPA), were developed to sum non-perturbatively important 
classes of infinitely many such diagrams. 
The first step, still general, to utilize these methods from solid-state physics, is to 
rewrite F( {H'}, T) to a form of logarithm of a Gaussian integral with a matrix func-
tion a, dependent on external magnetic field H', playing the role of a "self-energy" 
renormalizing the exchange interaction and a new parameter U independent of H', 
Without the a- and Z7-renormalizations, the "free" Gaussian model depends on tem-
perature T and single parameter s which assumes as its stationary value the Weiss 
molecular field, a and V incorporate, in principle, all spin fluctuations. Quantities a and 
s form a complete set of variational parameters, provided the dependence of a on H' is 
determined. For this purpose, we have developed a systematic renormalized expansion 
each term of which is a non-perturbative sum of infinitely many irreducible diagrams 
from (2). The lowest-order term corresponds to the CPA of the alloy spectral theory 
and has the following properties [12, 11]: 
(i) it is the best single-site theory involving exactly all on-site fluctuations, 
(ii) the inter-site correlations are treated approximatively, but in a self-consistent 
way: the environment affects both the single-site magnetization and the inter-site 
coupling in an averaged way such that the surrounding sites be physically equivalent 
to the site under inspection. 
In this approximation, if the linear response to the weak external magnetic field H' 
is assumed, a is independent of H' and is site-diagonal, i.e. a = <xl. A set of equations 
defining a, s, and U is

Tor a solution of (4) and (5) to be a local minimum of free energy (3), the following 
bounds on a must be imposed : 
The equations have a form not independent of the auxiliary parameter ¡i, however, 
the physical quantities such as magnetization s and the correlation length 
are independent of /.i. 
In these equations, (t2) describes the on-site spin fluctuations, while the influence 
of the environment enters into them through the lattice-dependent function g{o). 
In the high-temperature limit g(a) = ê / f i , and the theory becomes equivalent to the 
mean-field one. Because of the self-consistency, (4), (5) determine local minima of the 
RFIM free energy at all temperatures and all amplitudes of random field A2 = 
= ((¿r)2>a-
The single-site renormalization involved in a preserves much of the features of the 
molecular field, particularly the anomalous dimension rj = 0. However, there are two 
main qualitative differences. First, our theory renormalizes the exchange interaction 
Jn to (J^ 1 — crl)-1 coupling single sites to the rest of the lattice and this renormaliza-
tion depends non-trivially on the type of the lattice and dimensionality. Second, it 
appears that, in contradistinction to the mean field, this theory underestimates the 
ordering since further improvements can include only more inter-site spin correlations 
which favour the establishment of LRO. Thus the calculated critical temperatures 
should lie below the exact ones, as is exactly the case of the pure O(N) models [11]. 
3. Phase Diagram 
At critical temperatures, (5) becomes simpler since the temperature is critical when a 
reaches its upper bound in (7). Equation (5) then is

7W is the so-called Watson integral. In general, / w depends on lattice geometry and is 
a decreasing function of dimensionality, and / w —• 1 for d —» oo. The limiting value 
7W = 1 corresponds to the mean field. For d = 1,2, 7W = oo and this theory predicts 
no phase transition to the ordered state. For d = 3, 7W = 1.5164, 1.3932, and 1.3447 
for the s.c., b.c.c., and f.c.c. lattices, respectively. 
Equations (4) and (9) for critical temperatures and magnetizations are rescaled, by 
the factor I^ 1, mean-field equations, which is a consequence of the investigated model. 
Inasmuch as a general trend of the presented approximation is to overestimate the 
effect of the on-site spin fluctuations in comparison with the coherent long-range cor-
relations, which effectively lowers dimensionality, we believe that the resulting phase 
diagram reflects the global critical features of the d 
3 RFIM. 
Since the full mean-field phase diagram has not yet been shown, we display it for 
the bimodal distribution of the random field p(hT) = [S{hT — A) + d{hT + A)]/2 in

(magnetic, non-magnetic, 
respectively) 
can 
exist. In II both phases coexist. The dotted 
lines approximate equilibrium phase bound-
ary. The inset shows a detailed structure of 
the diagram close to the tricritical point 
Fig. 1. The thin solid line defines a bound-
ary up to where the magnetic (LRO) 
state can exist. The dashed line bounds 
the non-magnetic 
(multidomain) 
state 
with total magnetization s = 0 from below. 
The thick solid line is common to both 
phases and is a critical curve of second-
order phase transitions. It terminates at 
the tricritical point 
= -f-7^1, A0 = -f-/^1 arcosh (i)1'2 = 0.4389/^ • Below the 
tricritical temperature, critical curves define first-order phase transitions. At tempera-
ture d\ = l^f1 cosh2 x

x = -i- coth x = 0.7717, 
the 
dashed 
line 
reaches maximum A1 = xl^,1 cosh2 x = 0.4477/w1- For magnetic fields below this 
value, the field cooling leads to a phase transition to the ordered state and this transi-
tion is of second order for weak fields (below the tricritical value A0) and of first order 
above the tricritical value. Only for magnetic fields stronger than the critical field 
Au the multidomain state persists in field cooling down to zero temperature. 
In region II, where two phases coexist, history dependent and hysteresis effects take 
place. One of these phases must be at thermal equilibrium, i.e. absolute minimum of 
the free energy. The other state is metastable and should decay toward the ground 
(equilibrium) state. The equilibrium phase boundary, along which both states are ab-
solute minima of the free energy, is a line starting at the tricritcial point and terminat-
ing at •& = 0, A = i / ^ 1 . The detailed shape of this line depends on dimensionality and 
lattice in a complicated way. In Fig. 1, two easily accessible solutions are plotted. The 
single-spaced dotted line is the rescaled non-self-consistent solution (gr(or) =

simulating integration over a three-dimensional Brillouin zone. The rescaled mean-field 
solution (double-spaced dotted line) suits for higher dimensions. 
For d = 3, the calculated phase diagram is in agreement with domain wall theories 
predicting a metastable non-magnetic state of frozen domains. It is also consistent with 
a part of history-dependent measurements in higher magnetic fields and experimental 
data in weaker fields [7], There is also quantitative agreement withKhurana et al. [9 b] 
in the location of the tricritical point for the s.c. lattice. But the diagram displays some 
features that have not yet been revealed. First, there is always a lower critical magnetic 
field for a given temperature 
ACii = § arcosh (#/ w) _ 1 / 2 at which the non-magnetic 
phase disappears when decreasing the magnetic field and LRO is achieved. When the 
magnetic field is again increased below the tricritical temperature, LRO persists up to 
the upper critical magnetic field

Third, 
our theory 
predicts the existence of a metastable ferromagnetism also for d = 3. This state could 
cause deviations from the logarithmic decay of the non-magnetic state [8]. Fourth, 
a general conclusion can be drawn, namely that spin fluctuations for d = 3 seem quali-
tatively not to destroy the mean-field phase diagram.
