SUMMARY
Lysosomes serve dual antagonistic functions in cells by mediating anabolic growth signaling and the cata-
bolic turnover of macromolecules. How these janus-faced activities are regulated in response to cellular
nutrient status is poorly understood. We show here that lysosome morphology and function are reversibly
controlled by a nutrient-regulated signaling lipid switch that triggers the conversion between peripheral
motile mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling-active and static mTORC1-inactive degradative lysosomes
clustered at the cell center. Starvation-triggered relocalization of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI(4)
P)-metabolizing enzymes reshapes the lysosomal surface proteome to facilitate lysosomal proteolysis and
to repress mTORC1 signaling. Concomitantly, lysosomal phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI(3)P), which
marks motile signaling-active lysosomes in the cell periphery, is erased. Interference with this PI(3)P/PI(4)
P lipid switch module impairs the adaptive response of cells to altering nutrient supply. Our data unravel a
key function for lysosomal phosphoinositide metabolism in rewiring organellar membrane dynamics in
response to cellular nutrient status.
INTRODUCTION
Lysosomes and late endosomes (referred to as lysosomes for
simplicity) are single membrane-limited, dynamic organelles found
inall eukaryoticcells1,2that varyconsiderablyin theirnumber,posi-
tioning,3,4 morphology, size, pH,5,6 and hydrolase content7,8 and
play a dual antagonistic role in cell physiology.2,9 As terminal cata-
bolic stations, lysosomes degrade macromolecules, including
intra- and extracellular material (e.g., proteins, glycans, and lipids),
delivered to them via autophagy10–12 and endocytosis13–15 by acid
hydrolases in their lumen. The acidic lysosomal lumen (pH of 4.5–
5.0) is maintained by the v-ATPase.6,16 At the ultrastructural level,
these catabolic functions of lysosomes are often witnessed by
the accumulation of electron-dense material and the presence of
characteristic membrane lamellae where lipid degradation occurs.
The key catabolic function of lysosomes at the systems level is un-
derscoredbythefactthatgeneticmanipulationofgenesinvolvedin
autophagy and lysosomal proteolysis leads to embryonic lethality
inmice17–20andtheregulationoflysosomebiogenesisandfunction
is crucial for lipid catabolism in the liver21 and other organs. Inacti-
vating mutations in genes encoding for lysosomal hydrolases and
transporters result in a spectrum of catabolic diseases known as
lysosomal storage disorders17,22 with a combined incidence of at
least 1:5,000 live births.23
In addition, lysosomes have emerged as central decision-
making centers by playing anabolic roles as metabolic signaling
hubs that are critical for nutrient sensing and signaling.2,9 In the
fed state, the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1
(mTORC1) (comprised of mTOR kinase, Raptor, and mLST8) is
recruited to the lysosomal surface to promote anabolic pro-
grams (e.g., lipid and protein synthesis). When nutrients are
scarce, mTORC1 is rendered inactive to suppress anabolic
signaling and promote catabolic programs.24–26
Given these janus-faced activities in catabolic turnover and
anabolic growth signaling2,9,14,24 lysosomes must be able to func-
tionally adapt to alterations in nutrient supply. Previous studies
have identiﬁed a gene regulatory network centered around the
transcription factor EB (TFEB) and its relatives that can upregulate

lysosomal gene expression inresponse to stress, including starva-
tion on a timescale of many hours to days.27–30 TFEB activity is
repressed under anabolic conditions by mTORC1 signaling,
among other factors. Whether and how acute starvation repro-
grams lysosome function remains, however, poorly understood.
Recent evidence suggests that lysosomes may be able to rapidly
adapt to altering nutrient supply, for example, by repositioning
and/or lumenal pH regulation.5,6 Starvation correlates with
the perinuclear clustering of lysosomes,3,9 whereas in fed cells, ly-
sosomes become dispersed to the cell periphery via kinesin-
based mechanisms involving the small GTPase Arl8A/B31,32 and
the phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI(3)P)-binding protein
FYCO1.33,34 These and other data35–38 suggest that phosphoino-
sitides, minor phospholipids that serve as spatiotemporal orga-
nizers of organelle identity and dynamics,35,39 could play pivotal
yet poorly deﬁned roles in the adaptation of lysosome function36
in response to altering nutrient supply.40
Here, we identify a PI(3)P/phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate
(PI(4)P)-based lipid conversion mechanism that orchestrates
the functional switching of lysosomes between anabolic growth
signaling mediated by mTORC1 and the catabolic turnover of
macromolecules in response to cellular nutrient status, with
important implications for numerous diseases characterized by
lysosome dysfunction.14,17,41,42
RESULTS
Starvation antagonistically controls lysosomal
proteolysis and secretion via PI(4)P
Cellular deprivation of nutrients is counteracted by the lyso-
somal turnover of macromolecules.2,9,13,43 Consistently, we
found the lysosomal proteolytic activity of U2OS cells moni-
tored by the ﬂuorogenic probes MagicRed (i.e., cathepsin L
protease activity) and SiR-lysosome (i.e., cathepsin D protease
activity) to substantially increase in response to starvation
(Figures 1A and S1A). Lysosomes marked by LAMP1 became
perinuclearly clustered in HeLa and U2OS cells (Figures 1B
and S1B) and largely immotile (Figure 1C). Large electron-
dense, presumably degradative lysosomes accumulated in
the perinuclear area of starved cells (Figure 1D). As catabolism
(i.e., lysosomal proteolysis) and anabolism often are antagonis-
tically regulated, we explored the impact of nutrient starvation
on the secretory pathway. We focused on the Golgi complex,
which is at the heart of the secretory pathway and plays a
fundamental anabolic role in cell growth via the synthesis and
transport of around one-third of all human proteins and most
lipids.44 To monitor protein export, we used a temperature-sen-
sitive mutant variant of vesicular stomatitis virus G protein
(VSV-Gts) as a reporter. VSV-Gts was efﬁciently exported from
the Golgi complex to the cell surface in fed cells, however, it
was largely retained in the perinuclear Golgi area in starved
cells (Figure 1E). Starvation thus antagonistically controls lyso-
somal proteolysis and protein secretion (Figure 1H).
Export of secretory cargo from the Golgi depends on PI(4)
P35,39 as veriﬁed by the effects of PI4K3B35 inhibition (Figure 1E)
or acute chemical-genetic recruitment of the 4-phosphatase
Sac1 to the Golgi (Figure S1C). We hypothesized that the star-
vation-induced repression of protein secretion via the Golgi
complex and the facilitation of lysosomal proteolysis may be
mechanistically linked by PI(4)P, a signaling lipid that delineates
the secretory pathway in fed cells,35,39 but has also been de-
tected on a subset of lysosomes.37,38 We used the pleckstrin
homology
domain
of
oxysterol
binding
protein
(OSBP-
PH)11,45–47 and the bacterial effector protein SidM (P4M-
SidM)46,48,49 as speciﬁc optical reporters to monitor PI(4)P at
the Golgi or at lysosomes, respectively. In fed cells, PI(4)P
was concentrated at the Golgi, whereas limited amounts were
present at lysosomes as expected.46 Starvation induced within
minutes (Figure S1D) the depletion of PI(4)P from the Golgi (Fig-
ure 1F) and a corresponding increase in lysosomal PI(4)P
(Figures 1G and S1D). Similar results were obtained if PI(4)P-
speciﬁc antibodies were used to detect PI(4)P in ﬁxed cells:
nutrient starvation induced an increase in lysosomal PI(4)P,
whereas Golgi PI(4)P was depleted (Figure S1E). Brefeldin A
(BFA) or nocodazole, i.e., agents that disperse the Golgi com-
plex and inhibit vesicular trafﬁc from the Golgi, only marginally
affected PI(4)P levels at lysosomes or the distribution of PI(4)P-
containing lysosomes (Figure S1F). Lysosomal PI(4)P detected
by speciﬁc antibodies displayed near-perfect colocalization
with P4M-SidM as a reporter for PI(4)P on lysosomes (Fig-
ure S1G), conﬁrming probe speciﬁcity. Starvation did not affect
the total cellular levels of PI(4)P monitored by antibody (Fig-
ure S1H), the overall number of lysosomes per cell, or total
LAMP1 intensity (Figure S1I). Similar observations were made
in other cell types, using different starvation protocols, or
different
quantiﬁcation
methods
(Figure
S1J).
Starvation-
induced elevation of lysosomal PI(4)P levels was reverted
following the refeeding of starved cells (Figure S1K). Supple-
mentation of serum but not of amino acids sufﬁced to prevent
lysosomal PI(4)P accumulation (Figure S1L) and elevated lyso-
somal cathepsin activity (Figure S1M). Supplementation of
glucose resulted in moderately, albeit insigniﬁcantly, elevated
cathepsin activity in Earle’s Balanced Salt Solution (EBSS)-
cultured cells.
We conclude that starvation reversibly elevates lysosomal
PI(4)P levels and promotes lysosomal proteolysis (Figure 1H).
PI(4)P turnover controls lysosome function and
morphology
Starvation could facilitate lysosomal proteolysis by driving de
novo lysosomal protein synthesis via induced gene exp-
ression27–30 (Figure 2A, left). To test this, we determined possible
starvation-induced changes in the lysosomal proteome by quan-
titatively analyzing the protein content of lysosomes isolated
from fed or starved U2OS cells. In spite of the differences in lyso-
some morphology and proteolytic activity caused by nutrient
starvation (Figure 1), we found no signiﬁcant differences in pro-
tease levels (e.g., cathepsins) in lysosomes isolated from fed
versus starved cells (Figures 2B and S2A; Table S1). Consis-
tently, the starvation-induced increase in cathepsin L activity
was independent of de novo protein synthesis (Figure 2C), and
the total levels of major lysosomal membrane proteins were un-
affected by starvation (Figures 2D and S2B). Hence, short-term
(2–4 h) starvation-induced reshaping of lysosome function and
morphology (Figure 1) is not mediated by de novo synthesis of
lysosomal enzymes or entire lysosomes. Instead, it may arise

from the remodeling of lysosomes (Figure 2A, right) via regulatory
factors (e.g., phosphoinositide-metabolizing enzymes). To iden-
tify such factors, we conducted an unbiased siRNA screen for
phosphoinositide-metabolizing enzymes whose loss-of-function
alters lysosome position (as a surrogate measure for function).
We monitored lysosome position in siRNA-transfected U2OS
cells in pH6.5-buffered media (i.e., conditions that induce lyso-
some dispersion)5 by automated image analysis (Figure 2E).
This
analysis
identiﬁed
the
PI(4)P-speciﬁc
4-phosphatase
Sac150 as a potent regulator of lysosome positioning (Figure 2F;
Table S2). Loss of Sac1 in U2OS cells (Figure S2C) rendered ly-
sosomes less motile (Figure S2D) and caused them to cluster
perinuclearly, similar to depletion of Arl8b (Figure 2G). Perinu-
clear concentration of lysosomes was also seen in U2OS cells
grown in normal growth medium at neutral pH (Figure S2E), in
Sac1-depleted HeLa cells (Figure S2F), or if lysosome position
was quantiﬁed by other means51 (Figure S2G). This phenotype
was rescued by re-expression of siRNA-resistant Sac1 in cells
depleted of endogenous Sac1 (Figures 2H and S2H). Overex-
pression of Sac1 in wild-type (WT) cells caused lysosomal
dispersion (Figure S2I). Sac1-depleted cells displayed greatly
increased levels of lysosomal PI(4)P (Figure 2I) and elevated
lysosomal protease activity (Figure 2J). Ultrastructural analysis
of fed Sac1-depleted cells revealed the accumulation of en-
larged electron-dense multilamellar lysosomes (Figure 2K).
These lysosomes often were immunopositive for the autophago-
somal marker LC3 (Figures S2J and S2K) and LC3-II accumu-
lated in Sac1-depleted cells (Figure S2L). Moreover, we
observed that Sac1, which localizes to the endoplasmic reticu-
lum (ER) in fed cells,45,50 partially relocates to the Golgi complex
in response to starvation (Figures 2L–2M and S2M-S2N).
These data identify Sac150 as a major regulator of lysosome
function, likely by serving as an enzymatic sink for PI(4)P trans-
ferred to the ER via oxysterol-binding protein-related protein
(ORP) family proteins (e.g., OSBP and/or ORP4, see below)45
at membrane contact sites52(Figure 3A). Starvation-induced re-
localization of Sac1 away from ER/lysosome contacts would
then enable the accumulation of PI(4)P at lysosomes (compare
Figure 1H).
An enzymatic module that controls lysosome function
and dynamics via lysosomal PI(4)P
This model (Figure 3A) predicts that interference with the lipid
transfer activity of select ORP-family proteins should phenocopy
loss of Sac1. As OSBP had been suggested to mediate counter-
transport of PI(4)P in exchange for cholesterol at ER/lysosome
contacts,52 we treated cells with OSW-1, a small molecule inhib-
itor that targets OSBP and the closely related protein ORP4
(OSBP2).53,54 Treatment with OSW-1 increased lysosomal PI(4)
P levels (Figures 3B and S3A), led to accumulation of enlarged
electron-dense
multilamellar
lysosomes
(Figure
3C),
and
elevated lysosomal protease activity (Figure 3D). Lysosomes
became less motile and clustered in the perinuclear area in
OSW-1-treated cells (Figures S3B and S3C). Quantitative lipido-
mic analysis conﬁrmed the accumulation of PI-monophosphate
(i.e., PI(4)P) (Figure 3E) and revealed a striking depletion of
cholesterol but no other bulk lipids in lysosomes isolated from
OSW-1-treated cells (Figure S3D; Table S3). Next, we applied
Schweinfurthin G (SWG), a drug that selectively inhibits OSBP
but not ORP4.54 SWG treatment did not affect lysosomal PI(4)
P levels (Figure S3E), although it was as potent as OSW-1 in
elevating PI(4)P at the Golgi (Figure S3E), the major site of
OSBP activity in fed cells.45,53 Depletion of ORP4 (Figure S3F)
phenocopied OSW-1 with respect to increased lysosomal PI(4)
P (Figure 3F) and elevated lysosomal protease activity (Fig-
ure 3G). Consistently, starvation increased recruitment of
endogenous ORP4 to lysosomes (Figures 3H and S3G).
Previous work has identiﬁed phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase 2a
(PI4K2A) as an important source for PI(4)P synthesis at lyso-
somes,36,37,55 whereas PI(4)P synthesized by PI4K3B contributes
to preserving lysosomal identity.38 Nutrient starvation potently
induced the recruitment of endogenous mScarlet-PI4K2A to lyso-
somes (Figure 3I) but not to the Golgi (Figure S3H) in genome-en-
gineered cells. Starvation-induced enrichment of endogenous

PI4K2A was also observed by proximity biotinylation using the
lysosomal membrane protein TMEM19256 fused to APEX2 as a re-
porter (Figures 3J and S3I). Knockdown of PI4K2A reduced lyso-
somal PI(4)P levels, a phenotype that was mildly exacerbated by
concomitant inhibition of PI4K3B (Figure 3K). Consistently,
PI4K2A was strongly enriched over PI4K3B in lysosomal proximity
biotinylation experiments (Figure S3J). Lysosomal PI(4)P was
reduced in PI4K2A knockout (KO) cells (Figure S3K), and lyso-
somes isolated from these cells were depleted of PI-monophos-
phate measured by quantitative lipidomics (Figure 3L). PI4K2A
KO cells suffered from reductions in lysosome size (Figure S3L),
lysosomal protease activity (Figure S3M), and lysosomal choles-
terol levels (Figure S3D). The latter are consistent with the fact
that PI(4)P fuels cholesterol export from the ER to lysosomes via
ORP-family proteins. A similar depletion of lysosomal cholesterol
was observed in Sac1 knockdown cells (Figure S3N) as a result
of impaired PI(4)P/cholesterol countertransport.45,53 Moreover, ly-
sosomes became dispersed to the cell periphery in PI4K2A KO
cells or cells depleted of PI4K2A by siRNA (Figures S3O and
S3P). Re-expression of WT but not kinase-inactive PI4K2A
restored defective lysosome positioning in PI4K2A KO cells (Fig-
ure S3Q). To directly probe whether PI(4)P synthesis is required
at the lysosome, we used a chemical-genetic approach57 based
on the co-expression and ligand-induced heterodimerization of
TMEM192 fused to the FKBP-rapamycin-binding (FRB) domain
of mTOR and an FKBP-tagged cytoplasmic version of the catalytic
subunitoftypeIIIPI4-kinasea(PI4KA).58Rapalog-inducedrecruit-
ment of catalytically active but not inactive PI4KA to lysosomes
restored lysosome position in PI4K2A KO cells (Figures S3R and
S3S). Ectopic expression of a PI4KA chimera constitutively tar-
geted to lysosomes also restored lysosomal PI(4)P synthesis (Fig-
ureS3T)andrescuedlysosomedispersion(Figures3MandS3U)in
PI4K2A KO cells.
We noted that loss of PI4K2A and Sac1 depletion or inhibition
of ORPs alter lysosomal PI(4)P levels and lysosome morphology
and function in an antagonistic manner, but phenocopy each
other with respect to the depletion of cholesterol from lysosomes
(Figures S3D and S3N). These data suggest that lysosomal PI(4)
P directly controls lysosome function independent of choles-
terol. To test this, we conducted genetic epistasis experiments.
Elevated levels of lysosomal PI(4)P (Figure 3N) and perinuclear
clustering of lysosomes (Figure 3O) induced by depletion of
Sac1 were rescued by concomitant loss of PI4K2A. Loss of
PI4K2A also restored normal lysosomal protease activity in
Sac1 knockdown cells (Figure 3P). PI4K2A and Sac1 thus antag-
onistically regulate lysosome function via PI(4)P, independent of
cholesterol. Collectively, these data deﬁne a functional enzy-
matic module comprising PI4K2A, ORP4, and Sac1 that controls
lysosomal PI(4)P levels and, thereby, lysosome function and dy-
namics in response to cellular nutrient status.
A PI(4)P/PI(3)P lipid switch that enables the functional
remodeling of lysosomes
Our data suggest a critical role for lysosomal PI(4)P in the cellular
response to starvation. To dissect the underlying mechanism,
we quantitatively analyzed the lysosomal surface proteome
by proximity biotinylation in U2OS cells stably expressing
TMEM192-APEX2 (Figure S4A) under control conditions and
upon treatment with OSW-1 (Figure 4A; Table S4), that is, condi-
tions of lysosomal PI(4)P accumulation. GO term analysis found,
among others, proteins involved in lipid metabolism and transfer
(Figure S4B) such as ORP-family proteins45,59 known to bind to
PI(4)P (Figure S4C) to be highly enriched on lysosomes from
OSW-1-treated cells. Proteins involved in autophagy (Fig-
ure S4B) and the v-ATPase (Figure 4B) were also accumulated.
We conﬁrmed the increase in lysosomal v1-ATPase association
in cells treated with OSW-1 using SidK as a reporter16 (Fig-
ure 4C). Facilitated v1-ATPase recruitment was further observed
in starved cells (in agreement with Johnson et al.6 and Ratto
et al.60) (Figure 4C), upon treatment with OSW-1 (Figure S4D)
or depletion of Sac1 (Figure S4E), i.e., conditions that elevate
lysosomal PI(4)P content. Moreover, SidK colocalized with
PI(4)P-containing lysosomes (Figure 4D). These ﬁndings are
consistent with recent data regarding the role of starvation60
and lysosome position6 in v1-ATPase recruitment to lysosomes
and provide an explanation for the increased lysosomal protease
activity of starved cells.
OSW-1 treatment also caused major changes in factors asso-
ciated with the synthesis, turnover, and function of PI(3)P, an en-
dolysosomal signaling lipid known to be associated with periph-
eral motile lysosomes.33 Accumulation of lysosomal PI(4)P by
OSW-1 induced the depletion of the PI(3)P-synthesizing enzyme
VPS34 and its associated subunits (PIK3R1, UVRAG) as well as
the PI(3)P-binding kinesin KIF16B61 from the lysosome surface.
Myotubularin family PI(3)P 3-phosphatases62 such as MTMR3,
MTMR9, and MTMR14 were enriched on lysosomes of OSW-
1-treated cells (Figure 4E). Moreover, we found that accumula-
tion of PI(4)P in the presence of OSW-1 (Figure S4F) resulted in
the concomitant depletion of PI(3)P from lysosomes monitored
by eGFP-2xFYVE (Figures S4F and S4G). To enable direct moni-
toring of this putative lysosomal PI(4)P/PI(3)P switch, we focused
on KIF16B, which harbors a PI(3)P-binding phox homology (PX)
domain61 that could serve as a reporter for lysosomal PI(3)P. The
PI(3)P-binding tail domain of KIF16B decorated a population of

low-intensity LysoTracker-containing lysosomes (Figure S4H),
and this localization was lost if PI(3)P synthesis was inhibited
(Figure S4I). Moreover, KIF16Btail was depleted from lysosomes
in cells treated with OSW-1 (Figures S4J and S4K).
The observation that accumulation of PI(4)P is associated with
the depletion of PI(3)P from lysosomes suggests the existence of
a lipid-based switch mechanism in which elevation of PI(4)P
levels (e.g., by starvation) erases PI(3)P on the same lysosomes
to enable their functional remodeling. In support of the lipid
switch hypothesis, we found that nutrient starvation caused
the rapid (i.e., min) loss of KIF16Btail from lysosomes, a change
that was paralleled by the concomitant increase in lysosomal
PI(4)P (Figures 4F and 4G; Video S1). No change was observed
if cells were kept in full media (Figure S4L). Acute elevation of
lysosomal PI(4)P by rapamycin-induced recruitment of PI4KA
to TMEM192-containing lysosomes caused the rapid dissocia-
tion of KIF16Btail in PI4K2A KO cells (Figure 4H). We used an
orthogonal biochemical approach to speciﬁcally label PI(3)P
versus PI(4)P-containing lysosomes by proximity biotinylation.
The PI(3)P reporting PX domain of KIF16B was effectively bio-
tinylated at TMEM192-APEX2-containing lysosomes in fed cells
but was lost upon starvation or treatment with OSW-1/VPS34-
IN1 used as a control. The lysosomal PI(4)P reporter mCherry-
P4M-SidM displayed the reverse behavior (Figure S4M). We
conclude that lysosomal levels of PI(4)P and PI(3)P are antago-
nistically regulated.
We probed the relevance of the PI(3)P/PI(4)P lipid switch for
lysosome function by using PI4K2A KO cells that suffer from
impaired lysosomal PI(4)P synthesis. Nutrient starvation failed
to induce the dissociation of KIF16Btail from PI4K2A KO lyso-
somes (Figure 5A). PI4K2A KO cells also did not undergo starva-
tion-induced
perinuclear
clustering
(Figure
5B)
and
were
impaired with respect to the induction of lysosomal protease ac-
tivity (Figure 5C). We then monitored the effects of loss of
MTMR14, an enzyme mutated in an autosomal form of myotub-
ular myopathy62 that has been linked to autophagy/lysosomal
proteolysis.63 We expressed a catalytically inactive form of
MTMR14 in cells and found it to be potently recruited to
LysoTracker-labeled lysosomes in WT but not in PI4K2A KO
cells in response to starvation (Figure 5D). Lysosomal recruit-
ment of MTMR14 was further observed in cells treated with
OSW-1 (Figure S4N). Knockdown of MTMR14 (Figure S4O) pre-
vented the starvation-induced depletion of lysosomal PI(3)P (Fig-
ure 5E) and reduced lysosomal protease activity (Figure 5F).
Overexpression of MTMR14 reduced lysosome motility (Fig-
ure S4P). Finally, loss of MTMR14 partially restored defective
lysosome positioning in Sac1-depleted cells (Figure 5G), indi-
cating that PI(3)P and PI(4)P act as antagonistic regulators of
lysosome dynamics.
These collective ﬁndings show that lysosomes marked by PI(3)
P and PI(4)P undergo nutrient-regulated interconversion by a
lipid switch mechanism involving the PI(3)P phosphatase
MTMR14 and PI(4)P metabolizing enzymes, most notably
PI4K2A.
PI(4)P and PI(3)P mark morphologically and functionally
distinct populations of lysosomes
To directly visualize the morphologically and functionally distinct
populations of lysosomes marked by PI(3)P versus PI(4)P, we
developed a workﬂow for multicolor live correlative light and elec-
tron microscopy (live-CLEM) by focused ion beam scanning elec-
tron microscopy (FIB-SEM) (Figure 6A). Live-CLEM showed that
perinuclear static lysosomes comprise relatively large organelles
(0.3–1 mm in diameter), often containing electron-dense material
and lamellar internal membranes in their lumen (Figure 6B), fea-
tures typically associated with degradative lysosomes.1,5,7,13
Static lysosomes were brightly labeled by LysoTracker (Figures 6B
and 6C), displayed high protease activity (Figure S5A), and were
highly enriched in PI(4)P (Figures 6C and S5B) but devoid of PI(3)
P (Figure 6D). PI(4)P-containing lysosomes were perinuclearly
localized and largely immotile (Figures S5C and S5D) and proteo-
lytically highly active (Figures S5E and S5F). Further live-CLEM an-
alyses showed thatPI(4)Pmarks large electron-dense degradative
lysosomal compartments(Figure6E), resemblingstaticlysosomes
(Figure 6B) and electron-dense lysosomes seen in starved cells
(compare Figure 1D). These organelles were strikingly different
from peripheral motile lysosomes that were signiﬁcantly smaller
in size (Figures 6F–6J and S5I) and more heterogeneous with
respecttoelectron-densematerialand thepresenceofmultilamel-
lar membranes (Figures 6B and 6I). Small motile lysosomes con-
tained LAMP1 and CD63 (Figure S5G), displayed moderate pro-
teolytic activity (Figure S5H), and were clearly distinct from
Rab5-containing early endosomes (FigureS5G). Small motilelyso-
somes lacked PI(4)P (Figure 6C); instead, they were marked by

PI(3)P (i.e., KIF16B) (Figures 6D and 6F). Live-CLEM identiﬁed PI(3)
P-containing lysosomes as a heterogeneous population of periph-
erally localized (Figure S5J) small multilamellar vesicles (Figures
6H–6J) with reduced LysoTracker signal (Figure S5K) that were
essentially indistinguishable from the small motile lysosomes
described above.
We conclude that cells harbor two morphologically and func-
tionally distinct populations of lysosomes, i.e., small motile multi-
lamellar vesicles marked by PI(3)P and large electron-dense
degradative static compartments that contain PI(4)P (Fig-
ures 6C–6E).
Antagonistic control of mTORC1-mediated nutrient
signaling by lysosomal PI(3)P/PI(4)P
We hypothesized that the morphological and molecular dichot-
omy of lysosomes marked by PI(3)P versus PI(4)P may underlie
the dual antagonistic functions of lysosomes in mediating
anabolic growth signaling and the catabolic turnover of macro-
molecules (Figure 7A). A prediction from this model is that
elevated lysosomal PI(4)P, i.e., conditions in which degradative
lysosomes accumulate, should repress the anabolic function of
lysosomes mediated by mTORC1 signaling.24–26 We tested this
prediction by analyzing the effects of OSW-1 on the lysosomal
surface proteome by proximity labeling proteomics (Figure 7B)
or immunoblotting (Figures 7C and 7D). We found the core sub-
units of mTORC1 to be depleted from the lysosome surface under
conditions of elevated lysosomal PI(4)P (Figures 7B–7D). Quanti-
tative proteomics of isolated lysosomes via magnetic beads
conﬁrmed the depletion of mTORC1 from lysosomes in OSW-
1-treated cells (Figure S6A; Table S5). To monitor mTORC1 local-
ization, we generated a knockin (KI) cell line that endogenously
expresses eGFP-Raptor. Treatment of cells with OSW-1 caused
endogenous eGFP-Raptor/mTORC1 to dissociate from LAMP1-
labeled lysosomes (Figure S6B) to a similar degree as starvation
(Figure S6C) and repressed mTORC1 signaling monitored by
phospho-S6 kinase 1 (pS6K1), whereas SWG had little effect
(Figure S6D). Elevation of lysosomal PI(4)P due to loss of Sac1
(Figure S6E) or ORP4 (Figure S6F) repressed mTORC1 signaling
in refed cells. Conversely, PI4K2A KO cells displayed elevated
levels of phosphorylated mTORC1 substrates including pS6K
(Figure S6G), p4E-BP1, and pTFEB during refeeding (Figure 7E).
Loss of PI4K2A facilitated lysosomal mTORC1 recruitment (Fig-
ure S6H; Table S6), an effect that was counteracted by Sac1
(Figures S6I and S6J). Loss of PI4K2A also caused a kinetic delay
in the starvation-induced dissociation of mTOR from lysosomes
(Figure 7F) and the shutdown of mTORC1 signaling (Figure 7G).
It is important to note that although loss of Sac1 and PI4K2A
display opposite effects on lysosomal PI(4)P and mTORC1
signaling, they phenocopy each other with respect to the reduc-
tion in lysosomal cholesterol content (Figures S3D and S3N).
Moreover, simultaneous increase of PI(4)P and lysosomal
cholesterol in the presence of the lysosomotropic agent
L-leucyl-L-leucine methyl ester (LLOME)64 inhibited mTORC1,
and this phenotype was rescued by loss of PI4K2A (Figure S6K).
Hence, the effects of Sac1 and PI4K2A on mTORC1 signaling are
independent of the regulation of mTORC1 by lysosomal choles-
terol.52,65 Consistently, loss of PI4K2A restored normal PI(4)P
levels (see Figure 3N) and rescued defective mTORC1 signaling
caused by loss of Sac1 (Figure S6J). These results demonstrate
that PI(4)P represses mTORC1 signaling independent of lyso-
somal cholesterol.
We reasoned that the observed repression of mTORC1
signaling under conditions of elevated lysosomal PI(4)P may be a
consequence of loss of PI(3)P on lysosomes. Pharmacological in-
hibition of VPS3433,39 indeed depleted Raptor and mTOR from the
lysosomal surface in HEK293T and U2OS cells (Figures 7C, 7D,
S6B, and S6C) and repressed mTORC1 signaling (Figure S6L)
(consistent with Byﬁeld et al.66 and Nobukuni et al.67). Accumula-
tion of lysosomal PI(3)P in the absence of the PI(3)P phosphatase
MTMR14 facilitated mTORC1 signaling (Figure 7H) and led to par-
tialretention ofmTORonlysosomesinstarved cells(Figures 7Iand
S6M). Elevation of lysosomal PI(3)P in cells co-depleted of
MTMR14 restored normal mTORC1 signaling in Sac1 knockdown
cells (Figure 7J). Overexpression of MTMR14 led to reduced lyso-
somal levels of mTOR (Figure S6N) and reduced mTORC1
signaling (Figure S6O). Finally, we found the puriﬁed recombinant
Raptor subunit of mTORC1 to directly bind to PI(3)P with prefer-
ence over other lipids in vitro (Figure S6P).
We
hypothesized
that
the
PI(3)P/mTORC1-dependent
anabolic state of lysosomes may control via a feedback regula-
tory mechanism the PI(4)P-dependent catabolic state of lyso-
somes. To unravel such feedback regulation, we conducted
phosphoproteomic analysis of mTORC1 constitutively active
cells.
We
found
that
the
mTORC1
downstream
effector
S6K124,25,68 drives the phosphorylation of PI4K2A on serine
462 (Figure S7A; see Bonucci et al.69). Serine 462 resides within
the evolutionary conserved basic serine-rich C terminus of
PI4K2A (Figure S7B). By applying phospho-consensus motif an-
tibodies, we found nutrients and growth factors to stimulate
PI4K2A phosphorylation in a rapamycin-sensitive manner (Fig-
ure S7C). Deletion of the C-terminal 25 residues (PI4K2A-DC),
mutation of all seven serine residues contained in this region
(7A), or serine 462 mutation to alanine all rendered PI4K2A phos-
phorylation insensitive to nutrient signals (Figure S7C). An

analog-sensitive allele of S6K1 that can speciﬁcally utilize N6-
(benzyl)-ATP thioesters,70 promoted thiophosphorylation of
PI4K2A, indicating that PI4K2A is a direct substrate of S6K1 (Fig-
ure S7D). Deletion of S6K1, but not S6K2, blunted the stimulation
of PI4K2A phosphorylation and mimicked the effects of rapamy-
cin (Figures 7K and S7E). S6K1 KO cells displayed elevated lyso-
somal PI(4)P levels (Figures 7L and S7F). Deletion of the C-termi-
nal 25 residues from PI4K2A (Figure S7G) or inhibition of S6K1
(Figure S7H) facilitated its lysosomal targeting. Finally, expres-
sion of all C-terminal serine-to-alanine (7A) or serine 462/alanine
mutant PI4K2A in PI4K2A KO U2OS cells resulted in increased
lysosomal PI(4)P levels compared with expression of WT
PI4K2A (Figure S7I). These data identify PI4K2A as a substrate
of S6K1 downstream of nutrient-stimulated mTORC1 activation
in fed cells. They further suggest a model according to which the
anabolic state of lysosomes is maintained in part by active
mTORC1/S6K1-mediated repression of lysosomal PI(4)P syn-
thesis by inhibitory phosphorylation of PI4K2A (Figure S7J).
In summary, our ﬁndings demonstrate that mTORC1 localiza-
tion and activity are controlled antagonistically by lysosomal
PI(3)P/PI(4)P. This mechanism contributes to the functional
switching of lysosomes between anabolic growth signaling via
mTORC1 and the catabolic turnover of macromolecules in
response to cellular nutrient status.
DISCUSSION
We demonstrate that a local lysosomal PI(3)P/PI(4)P lipid switch
underlies the starvation-induced functional conversion of lyso-
somes
from
signaling-active
anabolic
growth-promoting
organelles to catabolic endstations involved in the turnover of
macromolecules. This conversion occurs independent of new
lysosomal protein synthesis and correlates with reduced lyso-
some motility and the corresponding accumulation of degrada-
tive perinuclear lysosomes. Active mTORC1 signaling likely con-
tributes to the maintenance of the anabolic state of lysosomes
marked by PI(3)P in fed cells. VPS34, the main PI(3)P-synthesiz-
ing enzyme on lysosomes35,36,39 has been shown to be stimu-
lated by insulin, a major driver of mTORC1 activity,71 whereas
PI(3)P promotes mTORC1 localization33 and activity (consistent
with Hong et al.,33 Byﬁeld et al.,66 and Nobukuni et al.67). We ﬁnd
that the C-terminal domain of PI4K2A is directly phosphorylated
by the mTORC1 effector S6K124–26,68 in signaling-hyperactive
Tsc1 KO cells, and interference with this mechanism boosts
PI4K2A-mediated lysosomal PI(4)P synthesis. We therefore
favor a model according to which active mTORC1 and lysosomal
PI(3)P synthesis are nested into a positive feedforward loop,
whereas, concomitantly, local formation of PI(4)P via PI4K2A is
repressed. The suppression of mTORC1/pS6K1 signaling at
the onset of starvation24–26,68 then enables PI4K2A-mediated
lysosomal PI(4)P synthesis (Figure S7J) and, thereby, the accu-
mulation of static proteolytically active lysosomes, resulting in
complete inhibition of mTORC1 activity. Consistently, earlier
data have shown that phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphophate
(PI(3,4)P2), a downstream lipid product of PI(4)P, represses
mTORC1 activity in insulin- or growth-factor-deprived cells.72,73
Hence, PI(4)P may synergize with PI(3,4)P2 and possibly other
lipids in promoting the catabolic growth-repressive function of
lysosomes in starved cells. We note that our data do not question
the proposal that cellular depletion of cholesterol renders cells
mTORC1 signaling-inactive.52,65,74 However, our results (see
Figures 7 and S7) do not support a view according to which lyso-
somal cholesterol levels directly scale with the mTORC1
signaling activity. Dissecting the precise relationship between
lysosomal lipid signaling and cholesterol shuttling to and from ly-
sosomes under physiological and pathophysiological conditions
(e.g., in Niemann Pick disease)17,65 therefore remains a fruitful
area for future studies.
The PI(3)P-to-PI(4)P lipid switch mechanism that facilitates lyso-
somal proteolysis in response to acute nutrient starvation
described here likely precedes and synergizes with the long-
term adaptation of lysosome number and active protease content
via the TFEB/TFE3-mediated gene regulatory CLEAR net-
work.27,29,30,75 Consistently, it has been found that newly synthe-
sized cathepsins require >8 h to mature,76 i.e., a timescale far
longer than the adaptive lipid switch mechanism unraveled here.
A variety of physiological and pathophysiological conditions
beyondstarvation, including lysosomal damage, osmotic stress,77
exercise, etc., can promote TFEB/TFE3-mediated lysosome
biogenesis.2,9,27 It thus seems possible that the enzymatic module
for lysosomal PI(4)P synthesis that facilitates lysosome-mediated
turnover of macromolecules is responsive to other cellular and
organismic stress conditions. Consistently, PI4K2A has recently
been found to contribute to the repair of artiﬁcially damaged lyso-
somal membranes caused by lysosomotropic agents via ATG2-
mediated lipid transfer from the ER at membrane contact sites.64
The pharmacological manipulation of the lysosomal PI(4)P
pathway may be of biomedical relevance for the treatment of hu-
man diseases related to lysosome dysfunction ranging from lyso-
somal storage disorders to neurodegenerative diseases and neu-
rodevelopmental defects associated with PI4K2A dysfunction,78
the aging-associated decline of autophagy/lysosome-mediated
protein
turnover,14,17,22,79
and
for
viral
infection.14
Similar
nutrient-regulated phosphoinositide-basedlipid switchesmay op-
erate at other organelles and compartments, possibly resulting in
the rewiring of the subcellular roadmap of phosphoinositides35,39
in starved cells, under conditions of stress, or in pathology.
Limitations of the study
Atpresent, itis unclear how the described pathway ofPI(3)P/PI(4)P
conversion on the same organelle results in the morphological al-
terations of lysosomes observed by live-CLEM. Conceivably, the
underlying mechanisms may involve fusion, e.g., with autophago-
somes80 and ﬁssion processes81 and/or the regulated delivery of
materials (e.g., lipids) from other compartments.82,83 Several
mechanistic details of the described pathway also remain unre-
solved. Future studies will be required to tackle these issues.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND STUDY PARTICIPANT DETAILS
Cell lines
HEK293T, U2OS and HeLa cells were obtained from ATCC. All cell lines except MCF7 (see below) were maintained in DMEM contain-
ing 4.5g/ml Glucose and L-glutamine (Gibco) supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal calve serum (Gibco) and 100 U/ml peni-
cillin and 100 mg/ml streptomycin (Gibco). Cells were routinely tested for Mycoplasma contamination and all tests were negative.
Sample size estimation: No estimation of sample size was done as sample sizes were not chosen based on pre-speciﬁed effect size.
Instead, multiple independent experiments were carried out using several biological replicates speciﬁed in the legends to ﬁgures.
METHOD DETAILS
Antibodies, plasmids, chemicals, peptides, and recombinant proteins, recombinant DNA, oligonucleotides, and software. See key
resources table.
Cell line generation
Transfected HEK293T cells grown in 10 cm dishes with 3.5mg PS-PAX, 1.5mg pMD2.g and 5mg Lentivector containing the gene of
interest using JetPrime transfection reagent. After 2-5 days collected virus by 5’, 2000rpm centrifugation of the supernatant; infected
3x10^5 U2OS, HeLa, or HEK293T cells in 6-well dish and selected infected cells using 2mg/ml Puromycin.
HEK293T GFP-Raptor knockin cell line generation
To generate knock-in cell lines, the genomic sequence of the target protein was analyzed using the UCSC genome browser. For the
design of guide RNAs (gRNA), the genomic sequence around the start codon was extracted from the UCSC genome browser and
used for gRNA design by CCTop. Guides were chosen to have minimal off targets and to ideally span over the start codon. If this was
impossible, the PAM sequence had to be removed from the donor construct, as additional cleavage even after successful editing
was possible. The chosen gRNA was cloned into the PX458 vector. PX458 encodes GFP-tagged Cas9 and promotor and framework
for the gRNA. For donor vector design, approximately 1000 bp upstream of the start codon and 1000 bp downstream of the start

codon were selected as homology arms (avoiding repeat sequences and sequences of a GC content > 65 % at the start or the endo
of the homology sequence, respectively). The homology arms and the tag to be introduced (EGFP) were ampliﬁed by PCR and
assembled into the vector. Subsequently, a 10 cm dish of 60-70 % conﬂuent HEK293T was transfected with 5 mg PX458 carrying
the gRNA sequence and 10 mg Donor plasmid using jetPRIME. Three days after transfection, single, GFP positive cells were sorted
into 20 96-well plates by FACS and incubated until grown to conﬂuency (3-4 weeks). Subsequently, the clones were split into two
wells of a 24 well plate, one well was used for screening and one for maintenance. For screening, 200 ml 2x SDS-PAGE sample was
added to one well of the 24 well plate and cells were lysed and brieﬂy sonicated. Subsequently, 10 ml were analyzed by immuno-
blotting using GFP and protein speciﬁc antibodies. Positive clones were expanded and further characterized.
U2OS knockin and knockout cell line generation
Guide DNA design
The single guide RNAs (sgRNA) were designed with the online tools ChopChop v3 using options for KI resp. KO (http://chopchop.
cbu.uib.no/; Labun et al.94) and CRISPOR (http://crispor.tefor.net/; Concordet and Haeussler 95). To generate sgRNA expression
plasmids (=Guide), oligonucleotides containing sgRNA sequence were cloned into a pSpCas9(BB)-2A-GFP vector (Addgene
plasmid #48138; a gift from Feng Zhang) using BbsI restriction digest. The GFP tag of the guide vector was used for single cell sorting.
Donor DNA design
The genomic DNA required to construct the N-terminal KI of mScarlet for PI4K2A and MTMR14 was extracted from U2OS cells using a
Monarch Genomic Puriﬁcation Kit (NEB) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The HDR donor construct for PI4K2A contained
homology regions approximately 0.6 kb in length immediately upstream and downstream of the target site, ampliﬁed from genomic
DNA. The mScarlet was ampliﬁed from plasmid PH-PLCD1_mScarlet_IRES_SYFP2_PH_N1. The homology arms and the mScarlet
were cloned into the MfeI- and ApalI-digested plasmid pcDNA3 using Gibson Assembly (NEB). After assembly, a linker
(GSGSPGSGSP) was introduced between mScarlet and the right homology arm in the BsrGI/SpeI-digested plasmid by oligocloning
to generate the ﬁnal donor plasmid (Donor-PI4K2A). The donor for the N-terminal KI of mScarlet in MTMR14 contained homology re-
gions approximately 0.7 kb in length immediately upstream and downstream of the target site, ampliﬁed from genomic U2OS DNA.
ThemScarlet withthe linker wasampliﬁed from Donor-PI4K2A. Thehomology arms andmScarlet-linker werecloned into the MfeI- and
ApalI-digested plasmid pcDNA3 using Gibson Assembly, resulting in the Donor-MTMR14. In both donor plasmids, the homology arm
downstream of mScarlet-KI, contains exon 1 of the protein, with a deleted start codon (cloning details available upon request).
S6K1/S6K2 gene editing in MCF7 cells
For the generation of S6k1, S6k2 or S6k1/S6k2-knockout (KO) lines, sgRNA oligos were cloned into pX459 (Addgene #62988) which
contains the Cas9 nuclease sequence and a puromycin resistance cassette. MCF7 cells were transfected with 2 mg of plasmid using
Amaxa Cell Line Nucleofector Kit V (VCA-1003, Lonza). Forty-eight hours later, cells were trypsinized into puromycin (1 mg/ml)
selection medium for 3 days and in regular medium thereafter. The colonies were allowed to grow until it was possible to pick
them with a ﬁltered tip and were transferred individually into a well of a 96-well-plate. Clones were expanded and veriﬁed for the
loss of S6k1, and S6k2 by western blotting. The sgRNAs sequences used to generate the clones for this study are the following:
S6k1, 50- ACT TCG GGT ACT TGG TAA AG-30 (PAM: GGG), S6k2, 50- CTC TGG GCC AAC GTT CAC GC -30 [PAM: TGG].
Cell culture and transfections
U2OS or HEK293T cells were seeded in 100-well plates (2 million per plate). Transfection was done 1 day later with polyethylenimine
(PEI, Polysciences) and respective DNA. For CRISPR-mediated mScarlet-KI, cells were co-transfected with 7.5 mg donor DNA, 2.5 mg
guide DNA and 20 mg PEI per 100-well plate (incubation of DNA together with PEI in serum-free medium for 20 minutes, then transfer
into the 100-well plate). For the KO of PI4K2A 6 mg guide DNA and 12 mg PEI per 100-well plate were used. 48 hours post-transfection,
single cells were sorted into 96-well plates using the FACSMelody (BD Biosciences). After single cells are grown, positive clones were
detected by immunoblotting (PI4K2A-KO, mScarlet-KI-PI4K2A) and sequencing (mScarlet-Ki-MTMR14, PI4K2A-KO, mScarlet-KI-
PI4K2A). Expression plasmids were transfected into cells using Lipofectamine2000 according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
For siRNA transfection 2.5x10^5-3x10^5 cells were seeded into 6-well dishes, reverse transfected with 50nM siRNA and 6ml
INTERFER in prediluted in serum-free medium, again transfected forward on day two and analyzed on day four. For co-transfecting
two siRNAs the respective siRNAs were mixed in equimolar concentration to a total of 100nM and mixed with 12ml INTERFERin. For
rescue experiments siRNA resistant clones were transfected on day three using Lipofectamine2000.
MCF7 cells were cultured in DMEM (#10566032; Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 20 U/ml penicillin/strepto-
mycin (#15140122; Gibco), and 1 mM sodium pyruvate (#11360070; Gibco).
MCF7 Clones or HEK293 cells were transfected with 3 ug of plasmid (PI4K2a-HA or PI4K2a-HA DcTerm) using Amaxa Cell Line
Nucleofector Kit V (VCA-1003, Lonza) or PEI reagent respectively.
Starvation
For starvation cells were rinsed 3x in EBSS (Gibco) and incubated with EBSS for 2-4 hours unless indicated otherwise.
MCF7 cells were serum starved overnight and subsequently amino acid starved with EBSS (Earle’s Balanced Salt Solution) for 1 h.
They were then either collected in starvation or stimulated with complete medium for 1 h in presence or absence of rapamycin.

Cloning and Mutagenesis
All plasmids were generated using standard cloning techniques.
Site-Directed Mutagenesis
A stop mutation was introduced to obtain a protein lacking residues 454–479 in HA-PI4K2a cDNA plasmid, using the GENEART site-
directed mutagenesis kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Brieﬂy, point-mutations were
introduced using the following primers: ATT-GTC-GAG-ACG-GCC-TGA-TCC-CAC-CAG-CGG-TCT and AGA-CCG-CTG-GTG-
GGA-TCA-GGC-CGT-CTC-GAC-AAT in a PCR protocol that ampliﬁes the entire plasmid template. The parent template is removed
using a DNA methylase, and bacteria were transformed with the nuclease-resistant nicked plasmid. Plasmids were isolated from the
resulting colonies and screened for the desired modiﬁcation. Finally, the positive clones are sequenced to conﬁrm the mutation and
the absence of additional mutations.
Lysates and immunoblotting
For examination of mTORC1 signaling pathway components cells were rinsed 3x in EBSS (Gibco), incubated with EBSS for 2-4
hours, and refed for 15-30 minutes in growth medium supplemented with 1x amino acids (M5550). Cells were lysed in 1% Igepal
(Sigma-Aldrich CA-630, formerly known as NP-40) in 50mM Tris pH8, 150mM NaCl buffer supplemented with Roche cComplete pro-
tease inhibitors and Sigma-Aldrich Phosphatase inhibitor cocktails #2 (P5726) and #3 (P0044). Crude cell lysates were cleared by
centrifugation and the resulting supernatant was boiled with Laemmli buffer for 10 minutes. Lysates resolved by 8-12% SDS
PAGE gels and blotted onto nitrocellulose using transfer buffer containing 20% Methanol. Membranes were blocked 1 hour at
room temperature in 5% skimmed milk in Tris buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween-20 (TBST) and incubated with primary anti-
bodies diluted in blocking buffer overnight at 4C, washed in TBST, incubated 1-hour room temperature with horse radish peroxidase
(HRP) -conjugated secondary antibody, imaged using BioRad ChemiDoc, and quantiﬁed using Fiji Gel Analyzer densitometry.
Immunoprecipitation
Cells were rinsed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.0), 138 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl,
5 mM EDTA, 20 mM NaF, 5% glycerol, 1% NP-40) in the presence of complete protease inhibitors cocktail tablets (Roche) and phos-
phatase inhibitor cocktail (PhosSTOP). For immunoprecipitation, 300 mg of protein extracts were incubated with beads coupled to
anti-HA antibody (Thermoﬁsher) 1h at 4C on a rotating wheel. After ﬁve washes in lysis buffer, the immunocomplexes were released
by addition of SDS sample buffer. Samples were resolved by SDS–PAGE before transfer onto PVDF membrane (Millipore) followed
by incubation with primary antibody (anti-HA (Thermoﬁsher, 26183), anti-RXRXX[S/T] (CST #10001)) and horseradish peroxidase-
linked secondary antibodies. For the input, 10 ul of lysate - taken after the immunoprecipitation process - were loaded onto SDS-
PAGE and developed for pS6 (CST #2215), S6K1 (CST #2708), S6K2 (Sigma # HPA010010) and actin (Sigma #A5316).
APEX2 proximity biotinylation lysate preparation
U2OS or HEK293T cells expressing stably integrated TMEM192-3xHA-APEX2 or Giantin-3xHA-APEX2 were incubated with 500mM
Phenol-Biotin/Biotin Tyramide for 30 minutes at 37C in 5%CO2. Biotinylation was initiated by adding 1mM hydrogen peroxide for
1 minute at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by rinsing cells 3 times with ice cold PBS containing a quencher cocktail
(10 mM sodium azide, 10 mM sodium ascorbate, and 5 mM Trolox). Cells were collected in 1% Igepal lysis buffer and lysates were
cleared by centrifugation (see lysates and immunoblotting section). Two percent of the volume of the cleared cell lysate was boiled
with Laemmli buffer for whole cell lysate analysis. Streptavidin-conjugated magnetic beads (Pierce #88816) were washed 3 times in
ice cold lysis buffer, and incubated with the remaining cleared cell lysate overnight on an orbital shaker at 4C. The next day ﬂow
through was removed and beads were washed 3 times with 1ml 4M Urea in Sodium Phosphate buffer pH 8 + 0.5% sodium dodecyl
sulfate (SDS) and 3 times with 1ml 4M Urea in Sodium Phosphate buffer pH 8 buffer without SDS, the Eppendorf tube was changed
before the last washing step, biotinylated proteins were dissociated from the beads by 10 minutes incubation at 95C with lysis buffer
containing 2x Laemmle buffer, Protease and Phosphatase Inhibitors.
Phosphoproteome enrichment and mass spectrometry
Phospho-proteome analysis in IMCD3 cells was described in Bonucci et al.69. In brief, cells were EBSS starved and lysed, proteins
were alkylated, trypsin digested and puriﬁed over C18 columns for enrichment with Fe-IMAC (#20432) for total phosphopeptides;
before LC-MS/MS peptides were subjected to a secondary trypsin digest and spectra were collected in a data-dependent manner
with a Thermo Orbitrap QExactive or Fusion Lumos Tribrid system.
TMEM192-APEX2-based proximity biotinylation mass spectrometry
Digestion
For mass spectrometry analysis control and OSW-1 samples were prepared in triplicates. Proteins from biotin immunoprecipitation
were loaded on SDS-PAGE and subjected to in-gel digestion. In brief, gel bands were excised, reduced with 5 mM DTT at 56 C for
30 min and alkylated with 40 mM chloroacetamide at room temperature for 30 min in the dark. Protein digestion was carried out using
trypsin at an enzyme-to-protein ratio of 1:100 (w/w) at 37 C overnight.

LC-MS analysis
LC-MS analysis was performed using an UltiMate 3000 RSLC nano LC system coupled on-line to an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass
spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc). Reversed-phase separation was performed using a 50 cm analytical column (in-house
packed with Poroshell 120 EC-C18, 2.7mm, Agilent Technologies) with a 120 min gradient. MS1 scans were performed in the orbitrap
using 120000 resolution; MS2 scans were acquired in the ion trap with an AGC target of 10000 and maximum injection time of 35 ms,
charge state 2-4 enable for MS2.
Data analysis
Data analysis including label free quantiﬁcation was performed using MaxQuant (version 1.6.2.6) using the following parameters: MS
ion mass tolerance: 4.5 ppm; MS2 ion mass tolerance: 0,6 Da; variable modiﬁcation: Met oxidation, Acetyl (Protein N-term); ﬁxed
modiﬁcations Cys carbamidomethyl; protease: Trypsin (R,K); allowed number of mis-cleavage: 2, database: SwissProt database
of Human (Human_2016okt3AUP000005640.fasta); label free quantiﬁcation and match between runs were enabled. After similarity
analysis between triplicates one OSW-1 triplicate (#2) was excluded from downstream analysis. All volcano plots show means of
three control samples and two OSW-1 samples. The raw MS data generated in the TMEM192-APEX2 experiment have been depos-
ited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository database and are publicly available as of the date of pub-
lication under the accession code PXD038512. The results are listed in Table S4.
Lysosome proteomics
Enrichment of lysosomes by superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs)
U2OS WT and U2OS PI4K2A KO cells were seeded at the density of 3 x 106 cells per 10 cm dish in DMEM supplemented with 10 %
fetal calf serum and lysosome enrichment performed as described previously.96 Brieﬂy, cells were supplemented with 10 % (v/v)
superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticle (SPIONs)97 solution (DexoMAG40, Liquid Research Limited, core size: 8 nm, hydrody-
namic size: 50 nm, Fe content: 10 mg/mL, coating: dextran 40 kDa) followed by incubation for a pulse period of 24 h. Cells were
washed with PBS, supplemented with fresh DMEM, and incubated for a chase period of 24 h. In case of OSW1 and EBSS treatment,
the respective drug was further added to the medium 24 h or 4 h before harvesting, respectively. Subsequently, cells were washed
with ice-cold PBS, and scraped off in 2 mL of isolation buffer (250 mM sucrose, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2,
1.5 mM MgAc, 10 mM pyrophosphate, 10 mM b-glycerophosphate, 2x cOmplete EDTA-free protease-inhibitor cocktail, and 1x
PhosSTOP phosphatase inhibitor cocktail), and cells from four dishes were pooled and dounced using a 15 mL Dounce homogenizer.
After centrifugation for 10 min at 500 g, 4 C, the post-nuclear supernatant (PNS) was transferred to a new tube, the pellet resus-
pended in 4 mL of isolation buffer, dounced, centrifuged, and both PNS fractions combined. This sample was used as an input frac-
tion for lysosome enrichment using LS columns in combination with a QuadroMACS magnet (both Miltenyi Biotec). Columns were
equilibrated using 0.5 % BSA in PBS, the PNS added, and the ﬂow through collected. Subsequently, columns were washed three
times using 1 mL of isolation buffer, removed from the magnet, and lysosomes were eluted using 1 mL isolation buffer and a plunger.
Lysosomal yield and integrity were determined using a b-hexosaminidase assay and protein content using the DC assay (Biorad).
Sample preparation and LC-MS/MS analysis
For proteomic analyses, 10 mg of input material was digested using SP3 as described elsewhere.98 In brief, enriched lysosomes were
resuspended in 0.1 M Triethylammonium bicarbonate (TEAB), followed by reduction and alkylation using Dithiothreitol and acryl-
amide with optimized conditions.99 SP3 magnetic beads were prepared by combining 40 mL of Sera-Mag Beads A and B (both
GE Healthcare), two washes with 150 mL of water, and resuspension in 100 mL of water (ﬁnal concentration: 20 mg/mL). To each sam-
ple, 5 mL of the bead suspension as well as 180 mL of 80 % ethanol were added followed by incubation for 10 min at 1000 rpm, 24 C.
Beads were immobilized using a magnetic rack, the supernatant was removed, and the beads were washed thrice with 200 mL 80 %
ethanol. After resuspension of beads in 50 mL 0.1 M TEAB containing rLysC (Promega, enzyme to protein ratio of 1:100), they were
incubated for 2 h at 1000 rpm, 37 C. Subsequently, trypsin (Promega) was added (enzyme to protein ratio of 1:50), and the samples
were incubated for 18 h at 1000 rpm, 37 C. Peptides were separated from beads using a magnetic rack, transferred to a fresh tube,
and dried in a vacuum centrifuge. After resuspension, peptides were desalted using C18 STAGE,100 the eluate fraction dried using a
vacuum centrifuge, and resuspended in 5 % formic acid (FA) and 5 % ACN.
Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analyses were performed using a Dionex Ultimate 3000 system
coupled with an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer (both Thermo Scientiﬁc). Analytical columns were produced in-house as fol-
lows: 50 cm spray tips were prepared from 360 mm outer diameter/100 mm inner diameter fused silica capillaries using a P-2000 laser
puller (Sutter Instruments) and packed with 3 mm Reprosil AQ C18 particles (Dr. Maisch) to a length of 40 cm. Samples were loaded
with 100 solvent A (0.1 % FA in water) at a ﬂow rate of 600 nL/min and separated with linear gradients of 120 min (Data-Independent
Acquisition (DIA)) and 240 min (Data-Dependent Acquisition (DDA)) from 5-35 % solvent B (95 % ACN, 0.1 % FA) at a ﬂow rate of 300
nL/min. For DDA analyses, survey scans were acquired in the orbitrap mass analyzer from 375-1200 m/z at a resolution of 60,000, a
maximum injection time of 50 ms, and an AGC target setting of 4 x 105. The most abundant precursor ions were fragmented in the
top speed mode (cycle time: 3 s) using higher collisional energy dissociation (HCD) with a collision energy of 30%. Charge states
from +2 to +4 were selected for fragmentation, MSMS spectra were acquired inthe orbitrap at a resolution of30,000, and dynamic exclu-
sion was deﬁned as 120 s. The precursor mass isolation window was set to 1.6 m/z, the AGC target setting of 5 x 104, and the maximum
injection time of 54 ms. For DIA, survey scans were acquired in the orbitrap at a resolution of 120,000, a maximum injection time of 50 ms,
and an AGC target setting of 5 x 105, covering the mass range between 375 to1200 m/z. After each scan, 36 static windowMS/MS scans

were acquired at 30% HCD, and the mass isolation window was set to 24.1 m/z, covering the mass range of the survey scan (200-2000
m/z) at a resolution of 30,000, an AGC target setting of 1 x 106 and a maximum injection time of 54 ms.
Data processing
All ﬁles were processed using Spectronaut version 16.2.220903.53000 (Biognosys). Hybrid spectral libraries were generated using
DDA and DIA ﬁles using the Spectronaut-Pulsar search engine combined with UniProt Homo sapiens (release date: 01/2021, 20,394
entries) and a database containing common contaminants. Analyses were performed on the following parameters: enzyme: trypsin;
ﬁxed modiﬁcation: propionamide (cysteine); variable modiﬁcations: acetyl (protein-N-termini) and oxidation (methionine). For reten-
tion time alignment, the dynamic iRT concept was applied.101 Data were ﬁltered with 1 % FDR (q-value<0.01) on the precursor and
global protein level, as well as 5% FDR on the run-wise protein level, global median-based normalization was performed, and missing
values were globally imputed. The raw MS data generated in this study by lysosome proteomics have been deposited to the
ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository database and are publicly available as of the date of publication un-
der the accession code PXD038428. Results are available in Tables S1, S5, and S6.
Lipid analysis of isolated lysosomes
Mass spectrometric quantitative lipid analysis of isolated lysosomes was performed as described102. Brieﬂy, lipid extractions in the
presence of internal lipid standards were performe using an acidic liquid-liquid extraction method,103 except for plasmalogens, which
were extracted under neutral conditions. To ensure that similar amounts of lipids were subjected to extractions, a test extraction
(ABD) was performed to determine the concentration of PC as a bulk membrane lipid and to adapt extractions volumes to similar
total lipid amounts. Typically, a total lipid amount of approximately 2300 pmol was extracted on average. Lipid extractions were per-
formed in the presence of internal lipid standards for each lipid class, with the standards resembling the structure of the endogenous
lipid species. Following this approach, a relative quantiﬁcation of lipid species was performed. Lipid standards were added prior to
extractions, using a master mix consisting of 75 pmol phosphatidylcholine (PC, 13:0/13:0, 14:0/14:0, 20:0/20:0; 21:0/21:0, Avanti
Polar Lipids), 75 pmol sphingomyelin (SM, d18:1 with N-acylated 13:0, 17:0, 25:0, semi-synthesized,103 150 pmol deuterated choles-
terol (D7-cholesterol, Cambridge Isotope Laboratory), 42 pmol phosphatidylinositol (PI, 17:0/20:4, Avanti Polar Lipids), 37.5 pmol
phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and 37.5 pmol phosphatidylserine (PS) (both 14:1/14:1, 20:1/20:1, 22:1/22:1, semi-synthesized103),
37.5 pmol diacylglycerol (DAG, 15:0/18:1-D7, Larodan), 25 pmol cholesteryl ester (CE, 9:0, 19:0, 24:1, Sigma), and 36 pmol triacyl-
glycerol (TAG, LM-6000/D5-17:0,17:1,17:1, Avanti Polar Lipids), 7.5 pmol ceramide (Cer, d18:1 with N-acylated 14:0, 17:0, 25:0,
semi-synthesized103 or Cer d18:1/18:0-D3, Matreya) and 7.5 pmol glucosylceramide (HexCer) (d18:1 with N-acylated 14:0, 19:0,
27:0, semi-synthesized or GlcCer d18:1/17:0, Avanti Polar Lipids), 7.5 pmol lactosylceramide (Hex2Cer, d18:1 with N-acylated
C17 fatty acid), 15 pmol phosphatidic acid (PA, 17:0/20:4, Avanti Polar Lipids), 15 pmol phosphatidylglycerol (PG, 14:1/14:1,
20:1/20:1, 22:1/22:1, semi-synthesized103) and 7.5 pmol lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC, 17:1, Avanti Polar Lipids). The phosphatidyl-
ethanolamine plasmalogen (PE P-) standard mix consisted of 33 pmol PE P-Mix 1 (16:0p/15:0, 16:0p/19:0, 16:0p/ 25:0), 46.5 pmol PE
P- Mix 2 (18:0p/15:0, 18:0p/19:0, 18:0p/25:0), 64.5 pmol PE P-Mix 3 (18:1p/15:0, 18:1p/19:0, 18:1p/25:0). Semi-synthesis of PE P-
was performed as described in Paltauf and Hermetter,104 starting with lyso-phosphatidylethanolamine plasmalogen (lyso-PE P-, Ma-
treya). Brieﬂy, to 10 mg dried lipid 2.8 mL anhydrous dichloromethane and 15.4 ml triethylamine is added, followed by 26 mg trityl
bromide. The reaction is stirred o/n under argon at RT. The N-titryl-protected lyso- PE P- is puriﬁed via a silica gel 60 column. To
the dried product, 20 mg DCC, 4 mg DMAP, 40 mg of the respective fatty acids (C15:0, C17:0 or C19) is added and dried under
reduced pressure. Following the addition of 2.8 mL anhydrous dichloromethane, the reaction is stirred o/n under argon at RT. The
N-titryl-protected PE P- is puriﬁed via a preparative Silica 60 TLC plate. Deprotection is done for by incubation in 4,8 ml anhydrous
n-hexane in the presence of Silica gel 60 H for 24 h at RT. Silica material is removed and the solvent evaporated under a gentle stream
of nitrogen at RT. Following a ﬁnal silica G60 column puriﬁcation, PE P- species with deﬁned fatty acid compositions are validated by
high resolution MS and NMR and are stored in dichloromethane:methanol (7:3, v:v) under argon at -80C.
The ﬁnal chloroform phase was evaporated under a gentle stream of nitrogen at 37 C. Samples were either directly subjected to
mass spectrometric analysis, or were stored at -20 C prior to analysis, which was typically done within 1-2 days after extraction.
Lipid extracts were resuspended in 10 mM ammonium acetate in 60 ml methanol. Samples were analyzed on an QTRAP5500 (Sciex)
mass spectrometer, except for TAG and DAG measurements, which were performed on a Q Exactive. Both MS systems were
coupled to a robotic with chip-based (HD-D ESI Chip, Advion Biosciences) electrospray infusion and ionization via a Triversa Nano-
mate (Advion Biosciences). For QTRAP5500 measurements, 2 ml aliquots of the resuspended lipid extracts were diluted 1:10 in
10 mM ammonium acetate in methanol in 96-well plates (Eppendorf twin tec 96). For TAG and DAG measurements on a Q Exactive,
5 ml aliquots of the reconstituted lipid extracts were diluted with 15 ml 7.5 mM ammonium formate in isopropanol:methanol:chloroform
(v:v:v, 4:2:1). For cholesterol determinations, the remaining lipid extract was again evaporated and subjected to acetylation as
described in Liebisch et al.105 MS settings and scan procedures are listed in Table S3. Data evaluation was done using LipidView
1.3 beta (Sciex) for QTRAP 5500 data or LipidXplorer 1.2.8.1 (https://zenodo.org/record/3570469)106,107 and PeakStrainer108 for
Q Exactive data, and in-house-developed software (ShinyLipids and ShinyLipidcountr_alpha4). The amount for endogenous molec-
ular lipid species was calculated based on the intensities of the internal standards.
The data obtained are listed in Table S3.

cells in DMEM/10%FBS per well. All siRNAs (listed in Table S2) were prediluted in serum-free medium together with INTERFERin
siRNA transfection reagent and cells were reverse transfected with a ﬁnal concentration of 50 nmol siRNA, forward transfected again
the next day, left unperturbed on day three, and ﬁxed and stained on day four: Cells were incubated for 1 hour with 10mM CMFDA in
Ringer’s acetate solution pH 6.5 to induce lysosome dispersion, ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde/4% sucrose, incubated 1hr room
temperature with anti-LAMP1 (1:200 in 10% goat serum/0.05% Saponin in PBS), washed 3x 5 minutes with PBS, incubated 1hr
room temperature with anti-mouse Alexa647 1:1000 in 10% goat serum/0.05% Saponin/PBS including 1:200 Hoechst, washed
3x 5 minutes with PBS, aspirated all PBS, added 2 drops of Shandon Immu-Mount, cured for 2hrs RT before imaging. 96
well plates were imaged on NikonCSU Spinning Disk with 40x air objective and JOBS automated imaging: The microscope was pro-
grammed to automatically detect the brightest z-plane in every ﬁeld of view in the CMFDA channel, segment and count nuclei, make
an image if there were at least three nuclei detected, and image 300 cells per well.
Live cell imaging
Cells were cultured in Ibidi 8-well or Greiner 10-well glass bottom dishes, transfected with indicated plasmids, and/or loaded with
lysotracker blue (1:500), MagicRed (1:250), SiR-Lysosome (1mM), and/or Hoechst nuclear stain (1:200), incubated for 1 hour, medium
was changed and samples were imaged on NikonCSU Spinning Disk microscope equipped with environmental control chamber; all
live cell imaging was performed at 37C and in 5% CO2 unless indicated otherwise.
For MagicRed and SiR-Lysosome quantitative imaging cells were starved in EBSS for 2-4 hours unless indicated otherwise, 10
random ﬁelds of view were selected and imaged using a 20x air objective and hardware autofocus.
For tracking of lysosomes 1 second interval time-lapse sequences were recorded for 10-20 seconds using a 60x oil objective. For
live starvation experiments random ﬁelds of view that contained transfected cells were selected and 3-10 minutes interval time-lapse
sequences were recorded using a 40x air objective and hardware autofocus; after the ﬁrst frame the imaging chamber was removed,
cells were rinsed 3 times in EBSS, medium was changed to EBSS unless indicated otherwise, the imaging chamber was put back in
place, and time-lapse recording continued.
For secretion experiments cells transfected with a thermoreversible folding mutant, ts045, of vesicular stomatitis virus G tagged
with GFP (GFP-VSVG(ts), Wehland et al.109), were rinsed with pre-heated DMEM, medium was changed to pre-heated DMEM/10%
FBS containing control (fed condition) or PI4KIIIb-IN10, or to pre-heated DMEM (starved condition), the imaging chamber was
mounted on the 37C and 5% CO2 NikonCSU stage, random ﬁelds of view were selected in all samples, and time-lapse imaging
with 20x air objective and hardware autofocus was started; after 15 minutes the environmental control chamber was cooled to
32C to initiate GFP-VSVG(ts) export from the endoplasmic reticulon to the Golgi and through the secretory pathway.
For correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM) experiments cells were seeded on 50 or 500 mm gridded Ibidi m-Dish Grid-50
or Grid-500 glass bottom dishes (#81148 and #80156, respectively). Cells were loaded with 1:500 lysotracker blue, incubated for 1
hour, and medium was changed before imaging on NikonCSU with 37C and 5% CO2 environmental control and 60x water objective
(NA = 1.2), cells were time-lapse imaged with 1 second interval and after 10-20 seconds excess 4% paraformaldehyde/4% sucrose
was added while time-lapse imaging continued until lysotracker vesicles were completely stalled (typically after <10 seconds). A
135 nm step size z-stack was recorded and cells were post-ﬁxed in 2% Glutaraldehyde in PBS for 1 hour, washed 3 times in
PBS and processed for FIB-SEM (see below).
Electron Microscopy
Glutaraldehyde ﬁxed cells were washed with 0.1M cacodylate buffer and embedded in durcupan following a modiﬁed rOTO protocol
with 1% (w/v) OsO4/1.5% (w/v) K3Fe(CN)6 in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4); 0.2% (w/v) thiocarbohydrazide in water; 1% OsO4 in
water, 1% aqueous uranyl acetate with corresponding washes in between and subsequent acetone dehydration and resin inﬁltration.
Depending on experiment, for polymerization, coverslips were either mounted onto pre-polymerized resin blocks or excess resin was
removed in falcon with aceton atmosphere for minimal embedding. In either case cells were placed into a heating cupboard for 48 h
for polymerization. For 2D analysis and 2D CLEM, coverslips were removed by liquid nitrogen, areas trimmed and ultrathin sections
were collected onto wafers for SEM imaging.
For 3D CLEM, samples were mounted and carbon coated for FIB-SEM. Helios 5CX FIB-SEM autoslice and view workﬂow was
used in order to section and image the embedded cells. FIB was run at 30 kV, 0.23 nA and 10 nm milling step. Cross section images
were scanned at 1.5 – 2kV and 0.17 - 0,34 nA. Dwell time was 5ms at x=3.37 nm pixel resolution. ICD detector was used. Resulting 3D
stacks were binned to isotropic 10 nm voxel resolution. EM stack management and segmentation was performed using Microscopy
Image Browser,110 3D visualization was done using Imaris. CLEM alignment was performed using the BigWarp Plugin in Fiji.

Image analysis
Lysosome positioning and intensity on lysosomes in ﬁxed cells
Automated single cell segmentation, organelle detection, and intensity measurements were carried out using a custom-made Fiji plu-
gin.51 Brieﬂy, a median ﬁlter and background subtraction was applied to the DAPI channel. Automatic intensity threshold was used to
segment individual nuclei, which were further ﬁltered by size and excluding nuclei touching the edges of the ﬁeld of view; The CMFDA
channel and DAPI channel were merged, a large Gaussian ﬁlter was applied and the maxima ﬁnder with the segmented particles
option was used to segment individual cell. A ﬁxed intensity threshold was used to deﬁne a background mask in the merged
CMFDA and DAPI channel, which was subtracted from the cell masks. Lysosomes were detected based on the LAMP2 channel using
a ImageJ implementation of the Laplacian of Gauss (LoG) ﬁlter11 an d the Find Maxima command. The distance of each lysosome
detection within the individual cell mask was measured based on a Euclidean distance map from the edge of the nuclei mask. Whole
cell intensities and intensities on lysosomal detections were measured in the lysosome channel and optionally in a fourth channel, e.g.
mTOR or PI(4)P stain. R scripts were used to compile all measured parameters in single excel ﬁles for further analysis. All plotted
intensities were background subtracted.
Calculation of the fraction of cells with peripheral lysosomes
In order to minimize the effect of differing cell sizes in differently treated samples two parameters are required to accurately determine
lysosome positioning phenotypes: First, the average distance of detected lysosomes to the nuclear edge (distance) and second, the
average distance of detected lysosomes to the nuclear edge normalized by the cell’s maximum diameter, also referred to as Feret’s
diameter (normalized distance). In samples with differing cell size differences in distance could be simply due to different cell size and
therefore normalization by the Feret’s diameter (as a two-dimensional representation of cell size) is required; e.g. in small cells with
peripheral lysosomes and large cells with evenly distributed lysosomes the distance will be similar whereas the normalized distance
will accurately represent the phenotype. However, small cells with evenly distributed lysosomes and large cells with peripheral lyso-
somes will give rise to very similar normalized distance values while the difference is more accurately represented by the distance. To

factor in both, distance and normalized distance, we calculated the percentage of cells with above average distance and above
average normalized distance which represents a population with true peripheral lysosome phenotype irrespective of cell size; aver-
ages were calculated from the entire experiment.
SiRNA screen analysis
For a comprehensive analysis of the siRNA screen data a second quantiﬁcation method was introduced (see scheme in Figure 2E):
Peak normalized density of lysosome detections as a function of normalized distance was calculated in R using the kernel density plot
function density(). The normalized distance at 50% density was then plotted against the percentage of cells with peripheral
lysosomes.
GFP-Raptor, mTOR puncta
Single cells were automatically segmented based on the OrgaMapper Fiji Plugin, GFP-Raptor decorates vesicles were ﬁltered and
detected using the Fiji LoG 3D plugin and the Find Maxima command, respectively, counted per cell and normalized by cell area.

MagicRed, SiR-Lysosome, SidK
Analysis was carried out in Fiji, automated, and based on the OrgaMapper Plugin. MagicRed, SiR-Lysosome, or SidK was detected
using a LoG ﬁlter and the Find Maxima command, and intensity was measured on the detections. The signal was background sub-
tracted and cells with zero detections were factored in with a zero intensity value.
PI(3)P vs PI(4)P colocalization with lysosomes or Golgi membranes
Lysosomes were detect based on lysotracker signal using the LoG ﬁlterand the Find Maxima command, eGFP or mCherry-P4M-
SidMx2 intensity on lysotracker detections was measured over time. eGFP-OSBP-PH intensity was measured in a region of interest
encompassing the Golgi area over time.
PI(4)P vs. PI(3)P in starvation
mCherry-P4M-SidMx2 and GFP-KIF16btail-decorated vesicles were ﬁltered and detected using a LoG ﬁlter and the Find Maxima
command, respectively, and counted before and after starvation, OSW-1, or control treatments.
Lysosome tracking
Lysosomes were tracked using the Fijji plugin trackmate. VSV-G(ts) secretion: eGFP intensity was measured in the Golgi area over
time, normalized to time-point zero for every cell, and fold change effect compared to control (medium change to DMEM/10% FBS)
was calculated.
Pearson’s correlation
Pearson’s correlation was calculated using the Fiji JaCoP Plugin.
Immunoblotting
Densitometric quantiﬁcation of immunoblots decorated with ﬂuorescent antibodies were carried out in Fiji using the gel analyzer
function.
Analog-sensitive kinase assay
HEK293 cells were transfected with WT-S6K1 or AS-S6K1 (4 3 105 cells per well of a 6-well plate) were cultured overnight and trans-
fected with 2 mg of plasmid expressing PI4K2a using PEI reagent. Forty-eight hours later, cells were washed twice in PBS and incu-
bated in labelling buffer [20 mM HEPES (pH 7.3), 100 mM KOAc, 5 mM NaOAc, 2 mM MgOAc, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 0.5 mM
DTT, 5 mM creatine phosphate, 57 mg/ml creatine kinase, 30 mg/ml digitonin, 100 mM N6-benzyl-ATPgS (Biolog), 100 mM ATP, 5 mM
GTP, 13 complete protease inhibitors EDTA-free cocktail (Roche) and 13 phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (PhosSTOP, Roche)] at
room temperature for 20 min with gentle shaking. Alkylation buffer (100 mM Tris pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 2% NP-40, 0.2% SDS,
20 mM EDTA, 5% DMSO, 2 mM PNBM) was added subsequently, and the reaction was allowed to continue for 1 h at room temper-
ature with shaking. The cells were collected and the lysates cleared by centrifugation at 13,500 g for 10 min at 4C followed by immu-
noprecipitation of the target protein.
Recombinant protein expression and puriﬁcation
Raptor protein was puriﬁed as previously reported (PMID: 31601764). The cell pellet was re-suspended in Raptor Buffer (50 mM
HEPES 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM BME) and then sonicated on ice for 4.5. minutes. To the cell lysate, 0.2% triton was added and
then the lysate was centrifuged for 60 min in an SA-300 rotor. The supernatant was cleared through a 5 uM ﬁlter and loaded onto

300 GL (GE Healthcare) column equilibrated in Raptor Buffer. Elution fractions were then concentrated to 1 mg/mL in an Amicon 10k
concentrator, aliquoted, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80C.
Lipid overlay assays
PIP-Strips (Echelon Biosciences; P-6001) were incubated in blocking buffer (TBS-T containing 3% BSA) for 10 minutes for blocking.
The blocking buffer was removed and fresh blocking buffer added. Raptor, added between 0.02 and 0.08 ug/mL ﬁnal concentration
in the blocking buffer, was then incubated with the PIP-Strip for 1 hr at RT. The blocking buffer-protein mixture was removed, and the
PIP-Strip was washed 3 times with wash buffer (TBS-T). After washing, blocking buffer containing Raptor primary antibody (Merck
Millipore; 09-217) at 1:1000 was added to the PIP-Strip and incubated at RT for 1 hr. The primary antibody solution was removed and
the PIP-Strip was washed 3 times with wash buffer. The PIP-Strip was then incubated at RT for 1 hr in blocking buffer containing
Rabbit secondary antibody (Licor; 926–32211) at 1:10000. Secondary antibody solution was removed and the PIP-Strip was washed
3 times wash buffer, and then one time with TBS before imagining with Licor.
Experimental Design
No strategy for randomization, stratiﬁcation or blind selection of samples has been followed nor were sample sizes chosen based on
pre-speciﬁed effect sizes. Instead, several independent experiments were performed with multiple sample replicates as indicated in
ﬁgure legends.

Figure S7. S6K regulation of PI4K2A, related to Figure 7
(A) Phosphoproteomic analysis of S6K1 mutant cells. Volcano plot of IMAC enrichment in IMCD3 cells. The x axis shows the log2 ratio of phosphopeptides
between samples and the y axis shows the p value log10. The horizontal black bar represents the statistical cutoff of signiﬁcance (p value of 0.5). The red dots
represent downregulated phosphopeptides in the Tsc1/S6k1 double KO genotype, green dots indicate upregulated phosphopeptides. The PI4K2A phospho-
peptide is represented in blue. Data to generate the volcano plot were taken from Bonucci et al.69
(B) Alignment of PI4K2A C terminus in various species. 3 residues are conserved down to yeast (magenta arrowheads), 3 are conserved in metazoans (red
arrowheads), and another one down to X. laevis (green arrowhead). The black dotted line indicates the truncation site of the DC-term mutant.
(C) PI4K2A phosphorylation in the C terminus is sensitive to serum and rapamycin and S462 is the main phosphosite detected. Western blot analysis derived from
293T cells transfected with PI4K2A-HA in starved, refed, or rapamycin-treated cells. Phosphorylation of PI4K2A was detected with the p-RXRXXs/t* antibody. 7A,
all serine/threonine sites indicated by arrowheads in Figure S7B were mutated to alanine. Averages were calculated from n = 3 independent experiments except
for DC-term, for which averages were calculated from n = 2 independent experiments.

(J) Model for the negative control of lysosomal PI(4)P synthesis by inhibitory phosphorylation of PI4K2A via active S6K1 downstream of nutrient-stimulated
mTORC1 activation in fed cells. Upon starvation mTORC1 and S6K become inactive, resulting in PI4K2A disinhibition, lysosomal PI(4)P synthesis, and complete
mTORC1 inhibition.
