Combining research approaches from biology, semiotics, philosophy and linguistics, 
the field of biosemiotics studies semiotic processes as they occur in and among 
living systems. This has important implications and applications for issues ranging 
from natural selection to animal behaviour and human psychology, leaving 
biosemiotics at the cutting edge of the research on the fundamentals of life.
The Springer book series Biosemiotics draws together contributions from leading 
scholars in international biosemiotics, producing an unparalleled series that will 
appeal to all those interested in the origins and evolution of life, including molecular 
and evolutionary biologists, ecologists, anthropologists, psychologists, philosophers 
and historians of science, linguists, semioticians and researchers in artificial life, 
information theory and communication technology.

Preface
This book is co-authored by Alexei Sharov (first author) and Morten Tønnessen 
(second author). The authors share an interest in examining fundamental issues 
about the nature of life, an interest that has brought them to work with theoretical 
biology. They also have shared experience as editors-in-chief of Biosemiotics 
(Springer), roles which they both filled in the period 2013–2020. In this preface, 
they tell the story of their respective ways into theoretical biology and biosemiotics, 
and more specifically the topic of semiotic agency.
The First Author’s Story
My student years at Moscow State University (MSU; Moscow, Russia) coincided 
with a rapid progress in both molecular biology and computer science. As a result, 
I became interested in the emerging area of theoretical biology and was puzzled by 
the problems of the origin of life, the nature of genetic and non-genetic heredity, and 
its role in the development, behavior, and evolution of living organisms. The turning 
point in my studies was participation in the Research Group on Theoretical Biology 
organized by a physicist Alexander Levich at MSU in 1974–1978. Regular semi-
nars, brainstorming sessions, and conferences (called winter schools) attracted 
many prominent thinkers in Russia. Among those I need to mention Julius Shreider 
and Sergey Meyen who contributed a lot of energy in educating and inspiring the 
younger generation of scientists, including me. One of the key ideas that fascinated 
me at that time was the model of epigenetic landscape proposed by Conrad 
Waddington, which explained how genes can control embryo development without 
violating the laws of physics and chemistry. This model showed that molecules in 
living cells may be meaningful, comparable to words in a human language. At about 
the same time, Howard Pattee developed a physical theory of signifying molecules 
that serve as messages for living organisms. His ideas boldly crossed the limits of 
physics/chemistry and humanities and initiated heated discussions within our 

vi
research group. Similar topics were discussed at the conference on Biology and 
Linguistics in Tartu, 1978.
At the end of 1980s, I decided to organize a seminar at the Faculty of Biology, 
MSU to continue developing ideas in theoretical biology. In a search for a name of 
the seminar, I came up with the term “biosemiotics,” which means integration of 
biology with semiotics. Semiotics, which is a theory of signs and meanings, seemed 
to me more relevant for theoretical biology than cybernetics or information theory. 
The seminar was a success and it attracted many biologists, philosophers, and semi-
oticians in Moscow. In 1989 and 1990, I organized two conferences (winter schools) 
on biosemiotics in a resort Sushnevo near Moscow, which both hosted more than 
100 participants. For several years I believed that I was the first to use the term 
“biosemiotics” but then I learned that the term was coined earlier by Friedrich 
S. Rothschild in 1962 and then independently reinvented by Yuri Stepanov in 1971. 
After leaving Russia for the USA in 1990, I met Thomas Sebeok who was working 
on the first book on biosemiotics at that time. In 2001, I joined the newly organized 
International Society for Biosemiotics Studies and then participated in most annual 
meetings. I worked as an ecologist for a short time at the West Virginia University, 
Morgantown, then – for 10 years at Virginia Tech University, Blacksburg. In 2003, 
I was hired by the National Institute of Aging (NIA/NIH) to analyze molecular 
genetics data and develop software for bioinformatics analysis of gene expression 
data, including large-scale sequencing projects. Later, I applied my experience in 
molecular biology to biosemiotics, in particular to processes of sign interpretation 
at the molecular level in living cells, known as “protosemiosis.”
This book emerged after I realized in 2009 that biology and science in general 
need a more developed notion of agency, which has been mostly neglected or used 
in a narrow anthropocentric context. The topic is strongly linked with biosemiotics 
and philosophy of pragmatism that was initiated by Charles Peirce, expanded by 
William James, and now represented by several domains of theoretical thought such 
as radical constructivism, enactivism, and evolutionary epistemology. In this book 
we consider semiotic agents as special beings with “extended ontological status” 
because their existence is interlinked functionally with goal-directedness forming a 
feedback loop. Despite its generality, the idea of semiotic agency is not just another 
“theory of everything” because it is possible to delineate specific criteria of agent-
ness, such as closure via production relation (i.e., agents are always produced by 
other agents) and functional relation (autopoiesis). Also, agents are organized into a 
hierarchy of subagents, which explains how do agential capacities emerge in the 
development and evolution and change from simple to more complex forms. This 
organization cannot be reduced to mechanisms because subagents are not just pegs 
in a wheel but have their partial semiotic freedom, and the outcome of their interac-
tion emerges via communication and semiogenesis. We assume that semiotic rea-
soning is compatible with science and opens new horizons of human knowledge.

The Second Author’s Story
The origin for my interest in semiotic agency is to be found in my recognition, as a 
teenager, of the fact that the natural world is in a state of environmental crisis. At the 
age of 14, I engaged in an environmental NGO. Over the next few years, I gradually 
came to realize that there must be something amiss with the way people look at 
nature. At the age of 18, I got interested in philosophy, which gave me tools to raise 
questions of fundamental importance.
My first guiding star in philosophy was Arne Næss (1912–2009), who is recog-
nized in Norway for developing introductory philosophy education and known 
internationally for developing the philosophy of deep ecology. When I began study-
ing philosophy at the University of Oslo in 1995, he was in his 80s, but still giving 
occasional public lectures. I thus got to hear him speak several times, and also inter-
viewed him and organized one of his last public appearances at the university.
Part of the core message of Arne Næss was that all living beings must be taken 
into consideration when we discuss environmental problems. Environmental prob-
lems are not only a problem for the human species – they affect all that lives. In 
order to understand the ecological crisis, we must understand what it is with human 
agency that makes us cause a global environmental crisis, and furthermore under-
stand the agency of all the other living beings that are also affected. How are envi-
ronmental problems experienced by them, how does it affect them, and how do they 
respond?
In the autumn of 1999, I was at Schumacher College in the United Kingdom as a 
volunteer while studying ontology. During the reading of the main work of the 
Norwegian eco-philosopher Peter Wessel Zapffe (1899–1990), a pioneer in 
Norwegian nature conservation history, I came across some passages about the 
German-Baltic biologist Jakob von Uexküll (1864–1944). This caught my interest, 
for in the Umwelt theory I found a theory from natural science that looked suitable 
for expressing a nature view that was consistent with my own understanding of 
nature and living beings. Uexküll’s calls for a subjective biology, and his emphasis 
on the experience of various organisms, resonated well with my belief that all living 
beings matter, and that what happens in nature matter to them.
Not long after this, during my master’s degree studies, I went for a study trip to 
Tartu in Estonia, to visit the Jakob von Uexküll archive there. I was hosted by Kalevi 
Kull, and also got to meet Timo Maran and Riin Magnus. All three have later been 
valuable collaborators on various projects, along with further Tartu biosemioticians, 
including Nelly Mäekiwi, Silver Rattasepp, and Kadri Tüür. In 2006, I moved to 
Tartu to pursue doctoral studies, and in 2007 I started Ph.D. studies with a project 
on Umwelt theory and environmental change, with Kalevi Kull as main supervisor. 
At this point in time, the Department of Semiotics in Tartu had started attracting 
international students as well as notable scholars in semiotics. For half a year, John 
Deely (1942–2017) was a visiting scholar, and I got to know him and his outlook on 
semiotics and philosophy quite well via discussions and conversations.
Preface

In this way, I became part of the vibrant biosemiotic environment of Tartu. Due 
to close relations with biosemioticians in Copenhagen, Denmark, many refer to the 
Tartu-Copenhagen school of biosemiotics. When I defended my Ph.D. dissertation 
in 2011, Jesper Hoffmeyer (1942–2019), who has been so central in establishing 
biosemiotics as an academic community internationally, was opponent along with 
Dominique Lestel. I consider both of them as innovative scholars with intrigu-
ing ideas.
Almost 20 years earlier, concerns for environmental problems had brought me to 
start realizing that something was amiss with the way people look at nature. During 
my university studies, I came to believe that an anthropocentric bias has colored the 
way most philosophers look at nature in unwarranted ways. In consequence, phi-
losophy needs to be reworked from bottom in some respects, in acknowledgement 
of the existence of a manifold of subjects, or agents, on this planet. Personally, I 
have done work, for example, in phenomenology and ethics to follow up on this, 
though much still remains to be done.
In the biosemiotic community, I have found an academic environment where 
alternative visions for biology and natural science are commonplace, and funda-
mental issues about science and nature can be pursued. While disagreement is fre-
quent, there is also some common ground to build on – for instance the recognition 
that semiotic agency is a widespread phenomenon, and an important feature of all 
organisms. This is what we try to present and develop in this book. I hope it will 
inspire some of the readers to pursue the same project of critically reassessing how 
we look at nature.

Introduction
Abstract  The introductory chapter presents agency as a subject of science. We 
combine mechanistic and non-mechanistic approaches in the analysis of the func-
tion and evolution of organisms, their subagents, and multi-organism systems. In 
this way we offer a theoretical platform for integrating semiotics with natural sci-
ences, particularly biology. Agents are autonomous systems that make sense of their 
environment and use this to achieve their goals. The functions of all agents are sup-
ported by mechanisms at the lowest level of subagents. However, the explanatory 
power of mechanistic analysis is not sufficient for explaining the evolution and 
behavior of complex agents. Non-mechanistic methods rely on the natural stability 
of agents where the properties of their meta-stable states (attractors) depend on vari-
ous factors, and such dependencies can be treated as sign relations if they are pre-
scriptive or regulatory in nature. Agents can replace or redirect mechanisms on 
demand in order to preserve their functions. Mechanisms are thus only means for 
performing higher-level semiotic functions. Within our framework, mechanism and 
semiosis are complementary approaches to the study of agency rather than mutually 
exclusive.
The propagation of organization and the subsequent growing 
diversification of the world is taken care of in Kauffman’s 
terminology by autonomous agents, and these agents are, as we 
shall see, semiotic creatures.
Hoffmeyer (2008b: 38).

1.1  Agency as a Subject of Science
This book is about active, purposeful systems called agents. These include humans, 
animals, plants, single-cell organisms, individual cells in multicellular organisms, 
families, colonies, populations, ecological consortia, human communities, busi-
nesses and nations, autonomous mechanisms, robots, functional protein complexes 
in cells, viruses, and modified or engineered organisms (Sharov, 2010, 2018; 
Tønnessen, 2015). No single branch of science has yet attempted to analyze agents 
in the full range of their diversity. Investigating agency – the capacities and activi-
ties of agents – is inevitably a novel multi-disciplinary enterprise that brings together 
disparate fields, including biology, chemistry, cybernetics, semiotics, economics, 
psychology, linguistics, anthropology, sociology, history, and philosophy. These 
disciplines are distributed across natural science, the social sciences and the human-
ities, and often do not mix peacefully because of deep differences in their histori-
cally developed methods, terminology, and heuristics.
The term ‘agent’ allows us to discuss functional similarities between various 
levels of biological organization at the levels of organisms, their parts, and multi-­
organism autonomous units. This term is widely used in the context of business and 
government, where it can mean a dealer, clerk or representative; it is also popular in 
cybernetics, where it is applied to either material automated devices such as robots 
and computers, or abstract semi-autonomous structures that emerge and function in 
computer memory during computation experiments. In legal theory, it is applied to 
a human person, business, or any other type of autonomous organization that takes 
actions and is subject to the law.
Kull et al. (2009: 171) defined agency as “[a] unit system with the capacity to 
generate end-directed behaviors”. Morten Tønnessen has summarized views on 
agency within the biosemiotic community, and lists the following features of agents: 
goal-directedness, self-governed activity, processing of semiosis, and choice of 
action (Tønnessen, 2015). These features cannot be reduced to physics, but they 
pose no contradiction to physics. Like Stuart Kauffman (2014), we recognize that 
even varieties of small molecular-scale systems, such as proteins, are too extensive 
to be fully described by physics either deterministically or statistically. We therefore 
need additional approaches. In this book, we use teleology and semiotics as such 
additional explanatory methods.
Some authors use the term self instead of agency (Sherman, 2017; Jonas, 1966). 
Jeremy Sherman (2017: section 5) wrote: “I will regard all living beings – and most 
important for solving the mystery of purpose, the very first living beings  – as 
selves”. He prefers using the term ‘self’ because he finds the notion ‘agent’ ambigu-
ous: even chemicals and computers can be called agents. The notion of ‘chemical 
agent’ came from alchemy, where it was used in a mythical sense, a sense which is 
no longer meaningful. Defining an agent as anything that has an effect on something 
else, as is the case with the contemporary term chemical agent, needlessly deflates 
the value of the term ‘agency’. As for computers, these can be autonomous and 
goal-directed agents (or sub-agents) as components of the human agency. Jesper

Hoffmeyer used the term ‘self’ for agents with an intentionality toward an outward 
reference. He wrote: “The self exists only insofar as that which is inside contains an 
intentionality toward or reference to that which is outside – an aboutness, as it is 
often called” (Hoffmeyer, 2008a: 26). Nobert Wiley in his book The semiotic self 
applied the term ‘self’ to humans in a social environment. He wrote: “The argument 
is that there are sui generis selves, that they are free and equal, and that they house 
a variety of rights. I am using the word “self” simply to mean a human being, per-
son, individual, or agents” (Wiley, 1994: vii).
We prefer using the term ‘agency’ rather than ‘self’ as a focal point for the fol-
lowing reasons. First, the term ‘self’ has historically for the most part been applied 
to humans only (Wiley, 1994) and thus it is anthropocentric. Second, ‘self’ gener-
ally refers to an individual person as the object of his/her reflective consciousness. 
In this sense, the concept is very different from the concept of ‘agent’, which is 
associated with activity, autonomy, and goal-directedness. Third, ‘self’ does not 
apply to all types of agents, and not even to all types of living agents. Sherman’s 
definition of self is limited to organisms and excludes both subagents within an 
organism and multi-organism agents. Hoffmeyer considers cells and multi-­organism 
agents as selves, which makes his theory more relevant in our view. But he restricts 
the term ‘self’ to systems with intentional or referential capacities which are capa-
ble of distinguishing their own inside from their own outside. These conditions are 
not met in simple agents such as ribosomes, bacteria, and autonomous human arti-
facts, which clearly have agential capacities. And fourth, the notion of ‘self’ appears 
to be at odds with cybernetics, relational biology, and synthetic biology, which are 
deeply grounded in artificial systems.
The study of agents, and especially, across different types of agents has generally 
been neglected in the past. Ancient philosophy was predominantly anthropocentric, 
and analysis of non-human agency was rare (though Aristotle represents a signifi-
cant exception). In the Age of Enlightenment, Cartesian philosophy assumed that 
agency was a property of the human soul which was conceived of as being immate-
rial. In early modernity, phenomena of the soul were often studied by abstract logic 
or theology rather than by the natural sciences. Within this doctrine, agency could 
not be explored productively because of the conceptual separation of the human 
soul, or intellect, from the material body. A breakthrough in the study of agency 
took place with the work of Lamarck, who naturalized agential features and was the 
first to demonstrate that organisms are autonomous and respond adaptively to their 
changing environments. Besides adapting to specific environments, he showed that 
lineages of organisms increase their autonomy and complexity in long-term 
evolution.
Darwin accepted many components of Lamarck’s theory but emphasized the 
mechanistic aspects of natural selection as the main factor of evolution. The role of 
the organism’s activity and adaptability was further neglected in neo-Darwinism, 
and ultimately was replaced by the concept of a mechanistic “blind watchmaker” 
(Dawkins, 1986).
Following assumptions of neo-Darwinism, Hugh Desmond and Philippe 
Huneman (2020) deny the ontic status (i.e., reality) of agency in organisms. Their

premise is that agential features can be explained equally well by an alternative 
mechanistic approach, namely the mechanistic theory of natural selection. They 
define agency as a system that possesses a certain purpose which is a particular state 
of the system, and which the system actively seeks to realize, and maximize in 
response to environmental change. A similar approach is developed by Samir 
Okasha (2018) in his book Agents and goals in evolution. These authors explore the 
structure of the Neo-Darwinist models of evolution rather than the nature of organ-
isms that participate in the evolutionary process. It is well known that the dynamics 
of human systems, such as crowd movement, population growth, or economic 
growth can be predicted reasonably well by mechanistic models that do not incor-
porate the agential capacities of humans. However, this does not mean that humans 
have no agential capacities.
In our view, the theory of natural selection does not explain how and why organ-
isms produce their phenotypes. What it does is to apply axioms of the theory of 
population genetics, which covers only the mechanistic part of the process, and even 
this is done in an oversimplified way without accounting for phenotypic plasticity, 
self-repair processes, epigenetic memory, and niche construction. This axiomatic 
approach has limited value in evolutionary theory, since the mechanisms of pheno-
type construction keep changing in macroevolution. The study of mechanisms 
therefore needs to be complemented with agential research that explores how the 
creative powers of organisms expand in the process of evolution.
Daniel Dennett (1991) similarly assumes that agency is an illusion stemming 
from unscientific “folk psychology”. The demise of agential thinking was facilitated 
by the apparent incompatibility of the notion of agency with physics and determin-
ism. Rationalistic philosophy has reduced agency to issues of logic and computa-
tion, which do not capture the full range of its core features. For example, programs 
on artificial intelligence (AI) and artificial life (AL) both explore computer-­
generated virtual agents (Weiss, 2013), which may be useful for modeling purposes. 
However, their dynamics is confined to computer memory, which implies having 
limited autonomy as compared to embodied agents, which is the main subject of 
this book.
The resistance to the notion of agency in organisms, which takes various forms 
from plain denial to acceptance of agency as a useful fiction or metaphor, is a trace 
of the Cartesian era. It contradicts the logic of evolutionary theory. If humans origi-
nated from primates (following Lamarck and Darwin), and humans have agential 
capacities, as accepted by most critics of animal agency, then human-like agency 
should have appeared at some point during the evolution of animals. The theory of 
evolution also suggests that any organ or feature never appears instantly in its highly 
developed form but instead emerges in a primitive form and then becomes more 
differentiated and complex. The same should be the case for agency. Given the con-
temporary evidence, it is inevitable for science and philosophy to recognize the 
legitimacy of agency in animals. A more complex question is whether agency can 
be attributed to all living organisms and even to autonomous artifacts constructed by 
organisms, as we assume in this book. This assumption follows from the main prin-
ciple of biosemiotics which states that life, semiosis, and agency are coextensive

(Anderson et al., 1984). Our perspective helps to explain the origin of life, when the 
first agents appeared by acquiring the capacity to perform simple functions needed 
for self-reproduction (see Chap. 5), and the subsequent integration of simple agents 
into more complex ones via long-term evolution (see Chap. 10).
The lack of theoretical research on agents and their general properties can be 
explained by the low level of demand for such studies in the past. However, it is now 
time to realize that new developments in AI, biotechnology, and environmental and 
social sciences, which we describe below, may benefit from a systematic study of 
agency. First, contemporary technical devices become increasingly complex (e.g., 
robots, integrated software tools, aircrafts, space stations, and inter-planetary 
probes). Detailed human control of these devices appears non-effective, and there is 
increasing emphasis on phenomena such as ‘machine learning’. This can only be 
achieved by granting more freedom to artificial devices, and letting them self-­
organize and self-improve. The emergence of “self-evolving” technology can be 
accelerated by learning from living organisms which have mastered the evolution-
ary game and accumulated enormous “expertise” on strategies of learning and evo-
lution. Principles of biological evolution are already implemented in computational 
methods such as genetic algorithms and cellular automata.
Second, the progress in contemporary biology requires development of self-­
learning algorithms for the integration of huge amounts of existing data on cellular 
functions. The complexity of cell regulatory networks, which cover multiple layers 
of functions (i.e., genomic, proteomic, epigenetic, and metabolic), is too high to be 
modeled manually in the old-fashioned way. Methods exploiting AI are expected to 
be helpful in deciphering cell functions from existing structural and experimental 
data. In addition, the AI may be further utilized to control fully automated experi-
ments on living cells. The discipline of synthetic biology has started developing 
artificial self-reproducing organisms (Glass, 2012). The theory of agency can be 
helpful in predicting the evolutionary potential of such genetically engineered 
organisms, and to assess related risks.
And third, human civilization faces serious environmental problems that cannot 
be effectively resolved without a solid theoretical study of agents. These problems 
can be approached only by balancing the goals and freedoms of many kinds of 
agents, from humans to animals, birds, plants, and other organisms. The future of 
humanity itself is now in doubt due to the widespread use of unsustainable practices 
that include overuse of natural resources, lack of stabilizing environmental and eco-
nomic regulations, and accumulation of weapons that threaten the long-term exis-
tence of all humankind. In this context, the theory of agency can contribute to 
rebalance the actual powers of governments and businesses and to increase the 
robustness of human civilization (Tønnessen, 2019).
The interest in agency as a general phenomenon has increased recently due to 
developments within biosemiotics (Hoffmeyer, 2008a; Barbieri, 2008; Sharov et al., 
2015), an interdisciplinary domain of science that integrates biology with semiotics,

which can be understood as a general theory of meaning1 and signification (Sharov, 
1992; Kull, 2005; Kull et al., 2011). Jesper Hoffmeyer (1942–2019), one of the 
founders of biosemiotics, emphasized the semiotic nature of agency in organisms 
and cells:
Biosemiotics is based on the understanding of agency as a real property of organismic life, 
a property that is ultimately rooted in the capacity of cells and organisms to interpret 
(whether consciously or unconsciously) events or states as referring to something other than 
themselves or, in other words, the capacity to interpret signs. (Hoffmeyer, 2013: 152)
Therefore, semiosis appears to be fundamentally linked with agency and life. As 
a result of such connections, a new trend in semiotics has formed, which is called 
agentive (or agential) semiotics (Niño, 2015). This new approach shifts the empha-
sis from signs towards agency, on the assumption that semiosis needs to be grounded 
in the function of agents, their autonomy and goal-directedness. If signs convey 
knowledge, we must also consider the systems that are users of knowledge, and 
these are semiotic agents. In this book we use the term ‘agency’ in the context of 
semiotic agency, building on the insight that signs appear to be at the core of bio-
logical functions such as heredity, metabolism, memory, perception, locomotion, 
instinct, and cognition.
Traditional semiotics reduces agents to interpreters, interpretation processes, or 
representation, which are abstract constructs grounded in semiotic theory. We think 
that we need to consider full-fledged semiotic agents in the empirical sense, in the 
same way as biology considers organisms. Organisms are real and can be studied 
scientifically even without knowing how they work in all the details (Minsky, 1986). 
Similarly, semiotic agents should be studied empirically in context-sensitive ways, 
and without being reduced to a particular function or process. This does not pre-
clude developing simplified models of agents that explore their particular features 
and the processes involved.
1.2  Agency and Physics
Agents are physical things with mass and three-dimensional shape that are com-
posed of known chemical elements, and their processes of change do not contradict 
physical laws or models. However, they have additional properties that cannot be 
fully captured by physics. These include autonomy, goal-directed functional activ-
ity, and semiosis. The immediate causes of actions can at some level be explained 
by physics, but the root causes for actions remain mostly unknown or unexplored 
because the chains of cause-effect events extend a long way into the past. They 
include self-amplifying feedback loops and cannot be fully reproduced in experi-
ments. Some causes may be hidden in the traces of millions of years of evolution. 
1 We generally apply the notion “meaning” to agents with minds, and the notion “information” to 
agents without minds. However, we also use these notions in relation to all agents, as it is used here.
1  Introduction

Analysis of these causes by means of physics is not feasible and should be replaced 
by an entirely different methodology. A first step in this direction is to recognize the 
existence of agents as entities that cannot be fully explained by physics. For a biolo-
gist, it is quite natural to identify agency in other living organisms even if we do not 
understand all molecular mechanisms that support living functions.
The current incompleteness of our knowledge in biology is immense and frus-
trating, and it creates an illusion that the progress in understanding of life lies exclu-
sively along discovering of just more mechanisms. But is it true that by knowing all 
the mechanisms we will understand fully such processes as perception, cognition, 
emotion, and intentionality in animals in humans?
Stuart Kauffman and Arran Gare argue that even with the existing knowledge, 
the combinatorial set of possibilities (i.e., possible states) is already too large to be 
handled by traditional methods of scientific inquiry. Thus, they propose to change 
the way we do science (Kauffman and Gare, 2015: 236):
First, we often cannot even know what can happen. Then we can form no statistical prob-
ability distributions for we do not know the sample spaces of the Adjacent Possibles. 
Harder, “sufficient reason” fails. We cannot reason about what we cannot know. Then 
Reason, the highest human virtue of the Greeks and our Enlightenment, is an insufficient 
guide for understanding, predicting, or living our lives forward. In turn, our model of the 
scientific method, based on physics: laws, deduction of new consequences given those laws, 
confirming or, with Popper, falsifying those predictions, fails. We have no laws from which 
to make the predictions. We need new ways to “do science”, when we cannot know what 
can happen. In truth, we already do science when we do not know beforehand what can 
happen. We do this all the time in our historical approach to evolution, as in paleontology, 
where we reconstruct the past from “the Record”. We do history, and the patterns of evolu-
tion we seek are those revealed in a history that is entailed by no laws of motion.
Kauffman (2014) builds his argument as follows. The universe has never created 
all potential proteins of a length of 200 amino acids:2 there are 10260 of such possible 
proteins. Taking the total number of particles in the universe and the Planck time 
scale into consideration, “it would take about 10 to the 39th power times the lifetime 
of the universe to make all these possible proteins once” (ibid: 5). As this shows, the 
probabilities of potential events cannot be effectively measured and used to predict 
the future. Now imagine that all biological mechanisms are finally uncovered, and 
our knowledge increased by several orders of magnitude. The set of possibilities 
would be then expanded further making it even harder to explain the function of 
organisms.
The nature of agents extends beyond physics in multiple ways. First, no sensor 
can accurately detect the generic property of being an agent or being alive – “life 
can be known only by life” (Jonas, 1966: 91). Physical sensors can detect life as we 
know it, but they also pick accidental properties of life that are not necessarily pres-
ent in some form of alien life. The observing agency should be competent enough 
to recognize life or cognition, and thus, the question posed by Frans de Waal in the 
2 For comparison, the median length of bacterial proteins is 267 amino acids (Brocchieri & 
Karlin, 2005).
1.2  Agency and Physics

10
title of his book “Are we smart enough to know how smart animals are?” (de Waal, 
2016) should be taken seriously. Second, agents are always produced by other 
agents of sufficient complexity. The world of agents is therefore closed by the pro-
duction relation and, in this sense, separated from the world of non-agential things.3 
Third, in contrast to merely physical things, agents have an extended ontological 
status because of a self-supporting and self-developing feedback loop between an 
agent and its purposes: the existence of an agent is supported by purposeful agent 
activity, which in turn is supported by agents’ existence. In other words, the exis-
tence of agents is purposeful. Fourth, agents require semiosis (meaningful use of 
signs), which builds on physical processes and yet is more than a physical process. 
Sign relations can potentially persist over long times because they are continuously 
reproduced by lineages of self-producing agents (for an example, consider a bacte-
rial lineage with a history of perhaps three billion years). And fifth, it appears 
impossible to make a formal model that describes and simulates all relevant fea-
tures of a natural agent, including its evolution and history of ecological interac-
tions. Any model of a natural agent captures only a subset of its agential features. 
This is true even for the simplest agents that we can hypothesize must have emerged 
at the dawn of life.
1.3  Mechanistic and Non-mechanistic Approaches to Agency
Agents are too diverse and multi-scale to be comprehensively handled by a single-­
level methodology. Scientists who participate in the biosemiotics movement have 
studied various levels of life, from biochemistry and molecular biology to physiol-
ogy, embryogenesis, behavioral science, and ecology (Barbieri, 2009; Prodi, 1988a; 
Krampen, 1981; Sebeok, 1972; von Uexküll et al., 1993). As Lawrence Cahoone 
remarks, the “genetic code, adaptation, sensation, animal communication, the expe-
rience of minded creatures, and self-reference are very different processes. If they 
satisfy the definition of semiosis, they do so in very different ways” (Cahoone, 
2013: 172). Similarly, Peter Cariani has proposed a “multiple-descriptions perspec-
tive” to reconcile functional and physical explanations of the simplest semiotic sys-
tems (he called them “purely syntactic”) such as DNA and digital computers 
(Cariani, 2015). Marcello Barbieri developed the Code Biology research program, 
which is primarily focused on the study of genetic codes and other codes in cells and 
organisms (Barbieri, 2012, 2015). He assumes that many living processes can be 
explained by the action of molecular machines (or agents) controlled by sequences 
of nucleic acids and codes. To describe the generation and interpretation of signs by 
molecular mechanisms in cells, Sharov and Vehkavaara (2015) used the term proto-
semiosis, which was first proposed by Prodi (1988b).
3 This separation is strong at high levels of complexity. But at the origin of life, it was possible for 
low complexity agents to emerge spontaneously from non-living chemical components.
1  Introduction

11
In contrast to protosemiosis, the interpretation of signs in complex semiotic 
agents (e.g., animals) cannot be explained by mechanisms alone. For example, 
visual perception of an object requires integration of sensorial signals from a large 
number of photoreceptors. When the same object is encountered multiple times, 
different photoreceptors and neurons participate in object sensing and recognition, 
and yet the result of recognition is usually stable. Thus, perception does not require 
a single dedicated mechanism but can be performed by a large set of alternative 
mechanisms. Such higher-end semiotic processes that support recognition of objects 
while using mechanisms flexibly was called eusemiosis (Sharov & Vehkavaara, 2015).
Complex semiotic processes can be explored by studying functional components 
and relations even if the underlying mechanisms are not fully known. Examples of 
such research projects are evolutionary theories ranging from Darwin (1866) to the 
contemporary Extended Evolutionary Synthesis (Pigliucci & Müller, 2010), the 
homologous series of variation (Vavilov, 1922), and symbiogenesis theory 
(Margulis, 1998; Gilbert et al., 2012). These theories all cover multiple levels of 
causality and satisfy the scientific criteria for reproducibility and objectivity in 
research. It is therefore logical and justified to expand science beyond mechanisms – 
a strategy that we develop in this book.
In biosemiotics, there is no consensus concerning the compatibility of semiosis 
and mechanisms. Some scholars assume that mechanistic interpretation processes 
occur at the molecular level inside cells (Barbieri, 2011; Kull et al., 2011). However, 
several biosemioticians consider a cell as the minimal semiotic system, and there-
fore deny the semiotic nature of intra-cellular molecular information processing 
mechanisms. Hoffmeyer (1996: 78) wrote: “All my instincts tell me that the cell 
forms the boundary, the lowest level at which it is reasonable to talk of true sign 
processes”. Similarly, Bruni (2008: 367) notes that “it is customary to recognize the 
cell as the most elementary integration unit for semiosis”. This notion appears to be 
incompatible with the version of biosemiotics developed by Barbieri, who distin-
guishes between “three worlds of life”: organic semiosis is based on coding rules 
supported by molecular-level mechanisms in cells, whereas animal semiosis and 
human semiosis include higher-level interpretation processes (Barbieri, 2014). As a 
result of such disagreements, biosemiotics experienced a painful split when the 
Code Biology group led by Barbieri left the International Society for Biosemiotics 
Studies in 2012 and formed their own International Society of Code Biology 
(ISCB).4 In this book we defend the notion that there is no need to see semiotic 
agency and mechanisms as being irreconcilable.
According to the New Mechanistic Philosophy (NMP), “[a] mechanism is a 
structure performing a function in virtue of its component parts, component opera-
tions, and their organization” (Bechtel & Abrahamsen, 2005: 423). The essence of 
mechanism is a reduction of higher-level phenomena to the dynamics of lower-level 
components (this was also one of Descartes´ core principles). If applied iteratively 
4 Some scholars have frequented both societies indiscriminately. For example, the second author of 
this book, Morten Tønnessen, was one of the founding members of the ISCB.

to each level, mechanistic methodology may end up focusing on the lowest known 
physical level of matter, such as elementary particles and quarks. The futility of 
such an approach for studying life and cognition is obvious, and therefore we will 
not criticize such a “straw mechanism”. However, the development of mechanistic 
models with a reasonable (not exaggerated) depth of reduction is an important com-
ponent of science (Heilbron, 2003: vii). Science is often viewed (erroneously) as 
being coextensive with mechanistic explanations. In consequence, the lack of 
description of a detailed mechanism is a common reason for why biology papers are 
rejected in journals such as Science and Nature. Theoretically, science is expected 
to cover all subjects of study without bias. But as an institution within established 
human traditions and paradigms (Kuhn, 1970), science has implicit preferences 
towards studying passive objects that respond to external factors (e.g., forces) in 
relatively simple and uniform ways as described by mathematical models, which 
are treated as “laws of nature”. Except for specialized areas, such as in behavioral 
science and ecology, studying agents is generally not appreciated in modern natural 
science.
The notion of mechanism keeps evolving along with scientific practice. Originally 
it was applied to human artifacts with a fixed set of solid parts assembled in a spe-
cific relation to each other, as in a mechanical clock. Cybernetics expanded the 
notion of mechanism to include computation, which denotes changes of digital 
memory states controlled by a program and the current state of a machine. Further 
generalization of the notion of mechanism has made it applicable to cell metabolism 
(Darden, 2006; Craver & Darden, 2013). Metabolic mechanisms work as open 
reaction-­diffusion systems where parts can emerge, disappear, or transform, and 
relations become established or broken over time. Despite of the “fluid” character of 
metabolic mechanisms, they involve a defined number of molecule types and fixed 
rules for interaction between them. Such an extended understanding of mechanism 
is not reductionism, determinism, or physicalism (Barbieri, 2011). The mechanistic 
method, as defined in NMP, is indispensable for the analysis of lower-level molecu-
lar functions in organisms, where processes can be explored by means of biochem-
istry and molecular biology. However, its explanatory potential appears much 
weaker when applied to higher-level processes in life, such as evolution, embryo-
genesis, cognition, and communication. We consider mechanism as an indispens-
able method in science, but we reject the idea that it should have any form of 
monopoly.
One aspect of a classical mechanism is its material and relatively static imple-
mentation. In contrast, matter is highly dynamic and often dispensable in living 
organisms, because material components of a cell are continuously replenished. 
Organisms change their character as they progress through the life cycle, and are 
eventually replaced by a new generation of organisms. Such considerations has 
inspired a so called “processual philosophy” in the context of biology, where the 
biological world is seen as a set of processes rather than as a set of living things 
(Nicholson & Dupre, 2018). This is a modern, biology-specific version of “process 
philosophy”, which is a larger philosophical enterprise with a long history. 
Processual philosophy assumes more complexity in systems dynamics compared to 
1  Introduction

13
the mechanistic worldview, for instance, because new types of interactions may 
emerge after an organism or its parts encounter a new kind of partner. However, 
except for a few publications (e.g., Walsh, 2018), processual philosophy has not 
entered the discussion on life-specific categories such as agency, teleology, and 
semiosis.
Some biologists have revolted against the dominance of mechanistic biology and 
started developing alternative approaches for explaining adaptation and adaptability 
at various time scales, including those in behavior, physiology, embryo develop-
ment, and evolution (Laubichler & Maienschein, 2009; Pigliucci & Müller, 2010). 
Some of these approaches have relied on reinterpretation of Aristotelean formal and 
final causes as factors that guide biological processes. For example, the variability 
of shapes in all species of shells can be described by a model with a small set of 
parameters (Raup, 1966). Another example is modeling of the shape of animal bod-
ies via geometric transformations (D’Arcy Thompson, 1917). These models of bio-
logical processes do not contradict known mechanisms; instead, they were applied 
to the higher-level processes that can be performed by a variety of different mecha-
nisms. In this case, mechanisms can be replaced and yet the same shape or topology 
is preserved. Shapes (forms) can therefore be seen as goals that may be realized by 
alternative mechanisms which each serve as means for reaching the goal. In light of 
this, we should not over-emphasize the importance of specific mechanistic 
explanations.
By a non-mechanistic approach, we mean the application of substantially incom-
plete models, where many components and relations are unknown or not clearly 
delineated, and teleology is accepted as an explanatory method. If we know the 
properties of a meta-stable trajectory of a system, also known as dynamic attractor, 
we can use them for making predictions even if the mechanisms of attractor forma-
tion and regulation are mostly unknown. This kind of teleological explanations does 
not contradict laws of physics; it is just another epistemological tool that works 
where mechanistic methods fail. Attractors are real because they are reproducible in 
repeated experiments, and this natural stability is based on some kind of memory 
(including heredity). The existence of such attractors in organisms justifies the use 
of semiotic terminology. For instance, the embryo development of an animal is a 
meta-stable trajectory that starts from a fertilized egg and eventually reaches the 
adult state, which is considered as a fully-functional phenotype. Then, any struc-
tural element or feature of an egg can be taken to be a sign of certain features of the 
adult organism that develops from that egg on the condition that the dependency 
between features of the egg and the adult is consistent (e.g., confirmed by correla-
tion analysis and/or manipulation) and biologically functional. Non-mechanistic 
methods can employ semiotics and utilize notions such as sign, meaning, commu-
nication, consciousness, autonomy, goal-directedness, and intentionality. They have 
for the most part crystallized in the twentieth century from human semiotics and 
linguistics, systems theory, and second-order cybernetics.
The notions of teleology and intentionality have been intensively discussed in 
philosophy (Anscombe, 1957; Davidson, 1963; Goldman, 1970; Malle et al., 2007; 
Dennett, 1991) and we thus need to clarify what version of teleology we defend in 
1.3  Mechanistic and Non-mechanistic Approaches to Agency

14
this book. One of the schools of thought attempts to remove subjectivity from tele-
ology by explaining the actions of individuals from objective facts rather than from 
subjective mental states such as beliefs and desires (Roessler & Perner, 2013; Perner 
& Esken, 2015; Peters, 2021). For example, Perner et al. (2018: 101–102) wrote that 
a “teleologist is concerned primarily with worldly facts”. Like behaviorism, this 
approach avoids discussing the unobserved mental states of subjects. Although 
objective facts can be helpful in developing statistically-based models of human and 
animal behavior, this approach tells nothing about the nature of agency. In this book 
we therefore assume a different methodology that is based on the Umwelt theory of 
Jakob von Uexküll (1982 [1940]). According to this theory, sentient animals develop 
a mental model of their environment, called an Umwelt, in which objects and events 
become associated with living functions. The teleology of organisms is thus an 
aspect of their Umwelt. In contemporary terminology, this theory can be classified 
as “mentalistic” because it describes mental states which are not directly observed 
in behavioral studies. The focus of this book is on the evolution and functional orga-
nization of agency (including the cognitive architecture of animal minds). Statistical 
predictive models of animal behavior are beyond the scope of this book, and not 
related to the key properties of agency which we discuss.
The objective version of teleology has also been applied to evolutionary theory 
by Samir Okasha, who assumes that goal directedness is a useful idiom despite of 
the fact that “the process of evolution by natural selection is mechanical and lacks 
foresight” (Okasha, 2018: 1). Although the life of simple organisms (e.g. bacteria) 
is mostly mechanical (in the sense of NMP), this does not imply that the agency of 
these organisms is not real. Bacteria interpret random mutations and environmental 
signs by initiating or changing their functions according to their habits which 
emerged via billions of years of adaptive evolution. Thus, the responses of bacteria 
are meaningful and agential, and their foresight is grounded in their genome and 
cell organization. As for multicellular animals and plants, their life cycle and evolu-
tionary process is certainly beyond mechanisms (Henning & Scarfe, 2009).
Although goal-directedness or teleology is a universal feature of agency, its form 
varies and depends on the complexity of the agent. In simple agents, goal-­
directedness is innate and expressed as a predisposition for certain useful activities 
that have emerged in the course of adaptive evolution. In more complex agents, 
goal-directedness is expressed in capacities that are useful only under specific con-
ditions, and may require a search for conditions where some of these capacities 
become useful. The capacity of animals to act and to search for favorable conditions 
is initially innate and low-efficient, but it gets improved with experience and learn-
ing over the lifespan of the animal.
The necessity of a non-mechanistic approach follows from the fact that complex 
agents acquire control over their mechanisms. Mechanistic explanations have little 
to offer at the time scales that are sufficiently long for an agent to effectively replace 
one mechanism with another one. For example, if a chemical signal within a cell 
fails to produce necessary changes, signaling is redirected through other pathways 
until a satisfactory response is generated. Already at the intracellular level in eukary-
otes, mechanistic explanations are insufficient by themselves.

1.4  Integrating Mechanism and Semiosis
Combining mechanistic and semiotic approaches to agency requires adjustments of 
both methodologies to open up some space for each other. This includes breaking 
the monopoly of mechanistic explanation, and naturalization of semiosis. The for-
mer change has already been addressed above; here we focus on the latter challenge. 
To naturalize semiosis, we use the following principles. First, we define what a sign 
is and can be in a wider context than generally used in linguistics and human semi-
otics. A sign is what Bateson (1987 [1972]: 459) called information: “a difference 
which makes a difference” for some agent.5 The capacity to detect and identify the 
difference (that is perceived) is supported by dedicated signaling and/or cognitive 
pathways within an agent, which have emerged via evolution or ontogeny for the 
purpose of supporting certain functions (that make the difference). In this perspec-
tive, signs are semiotic instruments that are utilized by agents to achieve regulation 
of their goal-directed activities. Second, we recognize semiosis even in simple 
agents that interpret signs mechanistically, i.e. by use of protosemiosis (Sharov & 
Vehkavaara, 2015). Third, semiosis (sign processes) can be shared by higher-level 
agents and their subagents. This means that semiotic functions can belong to mul-
tiple agential levels at the same time whenever a subagent performs a semiotic func-
tion for a higher-level agent. In such cases, the dependency of agents may appear to 
be bidirectional, thus forming a heterarchy (McCulloch, 1945). And fourth, the 
study of both simple and complex agents requires a combination of mechanistic and 
semiotic analyses which complement each other. These two heuristics are both pro-
ductive in predicting and explaining the phenomenon of agency, but the explanatory 
power of mechanistic models is higher for simple agents and decreases with increas-
ing complexity, where a non-mechanistic approach is increasingly productive.
These principles are closely related to the philosophical ideas of Prodi (1988a), 
who emphasized the material basis of signification and viewed semiosis as a ‘natu-
ral’ phenomenon (Cimatti, 2018). Prodi did not use the notion of agency, and thus 
his claim that signification has a material basis can be misinterpreted as an attempt 
to expand semiotic phenomena to the non-living matter, a perspective known as 
pansemiosis (everything is semiotic) or physiosemiosis (matter is semiotic). 
However, Prodi did not support pansemiosis, as we see in this quote: “Importantly, 
the property ‘to be a sign’ only exists in relation to a system of interpretation: a 
molecule is an antigen only in relation to an immune system” (Prodi, 1988b, cited 
in Favareau, 2010: 328). The distinction between ‘natural’ and ‘artificial’ is usually 
applied within the doctrine of Cartesian dualism, where agency is conceived of as 
exclusively human. In a biosemiotic perspective, however, agency is a constituent 
part of nature, and thus, Prodi is right in stating that semiosis is natural. Another 
important feature of biosemiotic ontology is that ‘artificial’ and ‘natural’ are not 
mutually exclusive in the context of human agency, unlike in worldviews were 
everything “man-made” is seen as unnatural. In our understanding, both ‘semiosis’ 
5 We have added “for some agent”, assuming that this is consistent with Bateson´s thought.
1.4  Integrating Mechanism and Semiosis

16
and ‘artificiality’ apply only to phenomena related to agency and agents, and neither 
of them occurs in the non-agential part of nature. This assumption clearly distin-
guishes biosemiotic ontology from pansemiosis.
The combination of mechanistic and semiotic approaches in studying agents is 
gaining momentum in both philosophy and science. Examples of recent books on 
this topic include Beyond mechanism (Henning & Scarfe, 2009) and Nature alive: 
Essays on the emergence and evolution of living agents (Scarfe, 2018). In the intro-
duction to the latter book, Lamza and Scarfe (2018) propose a “smart mechanicism” 
approach to the study of agency which intends to find a reasonable middle position 
between two extremes: the mechanistic reductionism and romantic anthropomor-
phism. This seems to match our goal of integrating the mechanistic and semiotic 
aspects of agency.
1.5  Outline of Book Chapters
The book is divided into four parts: (i) overview and historiography, (ii) agency in 
organisms and beyond, (iii) theoretical considerations, and (iv) agency and com-
plexity. The first part includes this introduction and an overview of the history of the 
notion of agency. In the historical chapter we start with Aristotle’s world view and 
his understanding of biology, ontology, science, and philosophical anthropology. 
Then we discuss enlightenment and post-enlightenment theories: Cartesian mind-­
body dualism, Kantian a priori knowledge, the evolutionism of Lamarck and 
Darwin, and the non-mechanistic approaches of James and Bergson. Modern 
approaches are represented by concepts and ideas from semiotics, phenomenology, 
hermeneutics, existentialism, cybernetics, and biosemiotics.
The second part discusses the agential features of humans, non-human organ-
isms, and primordial systems at the origin of life (Chaps. 3, 4 and 5). The main ideas 
of this part concern the multiplicity of agents in organisms and hierarchical organi-
zation of subagents, overcoming anthropocentrism, the dynamics of agency through 
evolution, ontogeny, historical and social processes, mental development, niche 
construction, semiotic networking, symbiogenesis, and sociality. Human agency is 
dissected in its individual development from the embryo to the life stages of the 
adult and elderly, and the social and cognitive development from the Paleolithic era 
to Modern times. A chapter on non-human agency emphasizes the evolution of 
biosemiosis from single-cell organisms to mammals and birds. A chapter on the 
origins of life presents the inferred historical roots of agency.
The third part of the book is devoted to theoretical analysis of concepts of agency, 
semiosis, semiogenesis, and phenomenology. In Chap. 6, we describe central prop-
erties of agents such as autonomy, goal-directedness, sensation, perception, and 
identity. We assert that every agent is a product of one or several parental agents 
with a comparable or higher level of complexity. Agency occurs in a variety of 
types. We distinguish between primary self-reproducing agents (e.g., organisms) 
and secondary non-reproducing agents (e.g., ribosomes, worker bees, mules, 
1  Introduction

17
robots), with the latter always being produced either directly or indirectly by pri-
mary agents. Agents can be active, temporarily inactive, or potential (i.e., “waiting” 
to be activated or embodied by other agents). Populations or communities of agents 
can be seen as constituting higher-level swarm agency.
Chapter 7 describes semiosis, which is the key process in semiotic agency. We 
follow the instrumental approach to signs by assuming that they represent the roles 
of things rather than essences, with these roles being grounded in the activity of 
agents. We further discuss the difference between signs and agents, since these 
notions are often confused in semiotics. Agents can carry signs for themselves and 
function as signs for other agents, but this does not contradict the fact that the roles 
of signs and agents are distinct: signs signify, whereas agents interpret signs and act. 
Agents are functional wholes; and in a system hierarchy, they are above signs 
because signs are used by agents, and not the other way around. Semiosis has pro-
gressed over the long evolutionary history of life, from primitive mechanism-­
supported forms to higher level types of interpretation and communication where 
mechanisms are dispensable. In this process we distinguish between mechanistic 
protosemiosis and eusemiosis, as two major types of semiosis.
Chapter 8 is focused on semiogenesis, which is the generation of new sign rela-
tions by agents via evolution, development, and learning. The degree of novelty 
varies from minor changes in already existing signs to the emergence of entirely 
new sign relations. The reason for considering semiogenesis separately from routine 
semiosis is that semiogenesis is enhanced by specific types of guidance and scaf-
folding which are generally known as adaptability. For example, new or modified 
signs may redirect existing communication pathways to different channels, which 
may cause combinatorial downstream responses. We develop an agential approach 
to semiogenesis in evolution which is opposed to the gene-centered conception of 
evolutionary change. As we show, semiotic innovations always emerge via the 
activity of agents at various hierarchical levels. To play any role in evolution, a 
mutation has to be interpreted as giving rise to some meaningful function by some 
living agent. Semiotic innovation may also emerge via behavioral choices and niche 
construction. Cognition, which is an advanced level of eusemiosis, is characterized 
by associative learning, representational memory, anticipation, and emotion.
In Chap. 9 we explore the value of phenomenology for studying agents in such 
aspects as subjectivity, sentience, and consciousness. We consider all organisms as 
endowed with an individual phenomenal world of some sort (e.g. an Umwelt), and 
all individual phenomenal worlds as sign-mediated in that they are underpinned by 
biosemiosis, either directly or indirectly. This implies calling for a more-than-­
human phenomenology that goes beyond self-reflective consciousness while still 
acknowledging different levels of semiotic and cognitive complexity. We support 
the idea of naturalizing phenomenology and add that phenomenology must also be 
integrated with biosemiotics.
The fourth part of the book (Chaps. 10, 11 and 12) deals with the internal and 
external (ecological) complexity of agents and includes chapters on composite 
agency, the world-changing effects of human agency, and agentology, an emerging 
science on agency across different contexts. The topic of composite agency is 
1.5  Outline of Book Chapters

18
important because all organisms have lower-level subagents. Most subagents are 
needed to perform specific local functions, but a few of them specialize in global 
regulation and the timing of various functions, protect the body from invasion of 
parasites, or support various levels of cognitive functions. Cooperation and symbio-
sis often lead to the emergence of chimerical agents composed of organisms that 
belong to remotely related species. The composite architecture of agents has several 
advantages: (i) specialization of functions increases the efficiency, (ii) modularity 
simplifies operation and control, and (iii) modularity increases adaptability and 
robustness at multiple functional levels. We discuss strategies of interaction between 
subagents: top-down, bottom-up, and mutual scaffolding (guiding interactions). 
Some subagents may break out and become fully independent from their host agent 
(e.g., in cases of mutualism or parasitism). In such cases composite agents may have 
a mixed identity because the outcome of the interaction of subagents is uncertain.
Any theory of agency would be incomplete if it did not acknowledge (as we do 
in Chap. 11) the fact that human civilization constitutes an agency that at some point 
in recent history became the major driver of environmental change on a planetary 
scale, with tendencies towards escalating developments. The dominating effect of a 
single species on the fate of the planet and all its inhabitants is a unique circum-
stance which deserves a special term. Recent and contemporary times, which are 
characterized by human-dominated ecology, are now called the epoch of the 
Anthropocene. Humans share the resources of one and the same planet with each 
other and with non-human organisms; it is therefore necessary to take the challenge 
of developing sustainable solutions to environmental problems seriously. Cases 
where biosemiotic theory may be particularly useful are animal welfare and wildlife 
management. Research on factors that facilitate autonomy in animals may improve 
the quality of life in wild as well as in domesticated animals. This in effect amounts 
to reconsidering how we relate to their agency by way of reconsidering our agency 
as manifested in human behavior. The task at hand can be framed in terms of 
required changes in agential modes of human perception and behavior, and often 
concerns recovering or developing varieties of human–non-human co-agency.
Chapter 12 discusses “agentology”, the science on semiotic agency, with empha-
sis on issues such as autonomy and semiotic freedom. The value of such an approach 
is seen in the potential for crosspollination between science and philosophy which 
may help to bridge conflicting methodologies for studying agency. In particular, we 
discuss the prospects for using agentology as a platform for integrating biosemiotics 
with information theory, constructivism, evolutionary epistemology, enactivism, 
and phenomenology.

Historical Overview of Developments 
of Notions of Agency
Abstract  Here we explore the development of the notion of agency within natural 
philosophy, modern philosophy and science. Ancient philosophy is represented by 
Aristotle’s theories on causation, the soul, and ethics. Enlightenment philosophy 
was inspired by the Cartesian mind-body dualism and includes the a priori knowl-
edge conceptualized by Kant. Evolutionism is represented by the theories of 
Lamarck, Darwin, and Spencer, and non-mechanistic approaches by the theories of 
James and Bergson. The semiotic understanding of agency was first developed by 
Locke, Peirce, and Morris. Features of human agency have been explored in the 
humanities within theoretical approaches such as phenomenology, existentialism, 
and hermeneutics. The cybernetic approach to agency uncovered the potential of 
complex systems to self-organize. Finally, the recent progress in biosemiotics has in 
effect united the efforts of science and those of the humanities in the study of semi-
otic agency.
2.1  Agency in Ancient Philosophy: Aristotle
Aristotle approached the notion of agency in three directions: (1) as a cause in a 
creation/production process, (2) as a soul, the carrier of life, sensitivity, and reason, 
and (3) an intelligent human being with normative criteria for what is good, beauti-
ful, and just.
According to Aristotle, the creation of any artifact has four different causes 
(aitia): a material, formal, efficient, and final causes (Aristotle, 1951). In the pro-
duction of human artifacts, the material cause is the substance to which the form is 
applied (e.g., clay for pottery). The formal cause is the structure or organization of 
a thing, which is immaterial by itself. The efficient cause is the activity of a human 
agent or instrument that actually produces the artifact; and the final cause is the 
purpose or utility of the artifact. According to Aristotle, everything in the natural 
world has four causes, with human artifacts being distinguished by the involvement 
of human agency. Non-human organisms are, like humans, agents in their own right. 

24
Only the final cause is essential for agents, whereas involvement of agents in other 
causes is incidental because it can be replaced by resources and tools.
One of the merits of Aristotle’s theory of causes is that it complemented the 
ancient substance-centered logic with a more process-centered line of thought. 
Ancient philosophy attributed many features of things to their substance or matter 
(e.g., all things made of iron are heavy, strong, and shiny). Democritus proposed 
further that elementary substances are discrete and represented by small particles 
called atoms, which were assumed to be unchangeable and indestructible. 
Empedocles considered only four elements: fire, air, water, and earth. Substance 
reasoning was also applied to living organisms, which led to the notion of the soul 
as a substance of life. In contrast to the static substance-reasoning, Aristotle pro-
posed a dynamic worldview of processes and mechanisms. He viewed matter as 
potentiality (dunamis) that may acquire different forms to produce actuality 
(entelecheia).
The soul as the moving (or originating) principle (archê) of animal life is more 
directly related to the notion of agency than the theory of causes. Aristotle distin-
guished “self-movers”, such as animals, from things that are being moved. He saw 
the soul as a property of the body because even thinking cannot be done without the 
body; and defined the soul as the actuality of the body, which is the form endowed 
with the capacity of life:
Soul, therefore, must be a specific thing in the sense that it is the form (eidos) of a natural 
body endowed with the capacity of life. Specific thinghood in this sense is actuality (entel-
echeia); and soul, therefore, is the actuality of the body as just defined. (Aristotle, 1951: 
125–126)
According to Aristotle, the soul is not in motion, but it can induce movements in 
natural bodies: “soul is ascribed only to a particular kind of natural body which has 
within itself the ‘power of producing’ (archê) movement and rest” (ibid: 127). 
Actuality includes both possession and exercise of knowledge; but only possession 
of knowledge is the property of the soul because the exercise of knowledge involves 
the body. Thus, Aristotle clarifies that the soul is the “initial actuality”. The soul is a 
factor that initiates the motion and also serves as the purpose (heneka tou) of motion.
Aristotle distinguished between three levels of the soul. All living organisms 
possess the simplest form of soul, which is called vegetative (nutritive) and supports 
growth and reproduction. Reproduction was considered as a way of reaching 
immortality. This means that producing individuals of the same kind is beneficial to 
mortal things. Aristotle also called it a “rudimentary soul” (prôtê psyche). Only 
animals have the second-level sensitive soul that supports sensation and movement, 
and finally, only human beings, have the understanding and reasoning power that 
characterizes the third level, the rational soul. These three levels of the soul can, in 
the case of humans, be interpreted as multiple agents that share the same human 
body and specialize in different tasks.
The two highest levels of the soul are supported by mind, a concept Aristotle 
elaborated. The mind is responsible for thinking, judging, and perceiving; using it 
“the soul discriminates and apprehends certain aspects of what exists” (Aristotle, 
2  Historical Overview of Developments of Notions of Agency

25
1951: 141). A lower level of mind is perception, shared by all animals, but only few 
animals have intelligence – the higher level of mind. “Perception, with respect to the 
objects of the sense directly involved, is always true, and moreover found in all 
animals; while thinking may be either true or false, and is limited to animals pos-
sessing ‘articulate reason’ (logos).” (ibid: 142). Aristotle also admits that perception 
is not always true but can be “subject to a minimum of falsety”, such as mistakes in 
identification of the kind of things or assessing attributes of things.
Aristotle does not have a special term for the autonomy of agents, but he 
addressed certain aspects of autonomy in relation to various levels of the soul. The 
vegetative soul carries the means and ends for self-support and reproduction (i.e., it 
is autotechnic and autotelic), whereas the animal mind initiates actions on demand 
via practical thought and appetition or desire (orexis). It seems that Aristotle did not 
see any logical problems in the relation between causation and free will (see discus-
sion by Hardie, 1968).
The ethical principles of Aristotle are meant to be applied solely to humans, and 
they suggest doing the most important and appropriate activities that are attainable 
for persons at different levels of intellectual and moral maturity.1 Although all the 
three levels of the soul have to be properly developed, the most central one for 
humans is in his view the highest level, which is related to thought and reason. This 
is known as the “function argument”, stating that the primary function of human 
beings is to make good use of reason and rationality: “Thus we conclude that man’s 
function is an activity of the soul in conformity with, or at any rate involving the use 
of, ‘rational principle’ (logos)” (Aristotle, 1951: 169). Aristotle identified happiness 
not with passive virtue but with “activity in accordance with virtue” (ibid: 171). He 
distinguishes between “willing” and “unwilling” actions; the latter category includes 
actions under compulsion or through ignorance which are generally not subject to 
ethical judgment. But he notes:
There are other cases in which submission to compulsion though not praised is condoned: 
when one is induced to do wrong by pressure of circumstances too heavy for any man to 
bear. Yet even in cases of this kind of plea of compulsion is sometimes inadmissible. 
(ibid: 201)
Ignorance is not always an excuse for wrongdoing:
Wicked men, of course, are ignorant in one sense: viz., of what they ought to do and abstain 
from doing; and in fact it is just this sort of error that is responsible for injustice and moral 
badness generally. (ibid: 203)
Aristotle formulated three ethical principles of human agency,
	(1)	 that man is the ‘originating principle’ (archê) of its actions.
	(2)	 that deliberation is concerned with things within the subject’s own power to accom-
plish, and.
	(3)	 that all our actions aim at ends distinct from themselves. Accordingly it is not the end 
but the means to the end that must be the object of deliberation. (ibid: 209)
1 Aristotle did not think men and women, or free citizens and slaves, had the same potential in this 
respect.
2.1  Agency in Ancient Philosophy: Aristotle

26
The ethical nature of action depends on the purposeful choice (proairesis) rather 
than on the wish (boulêsis) of an agent. The main difference is that a choice is 
directed to the means, whereas a wish is directed to the end. A choice is not bound 
by possibility constraints and always requires some action (e.g., men do not choose 
to be mortal). A choice is assumed to be taken when a person “has traced the ‘first 
step’ (archê) of the proposed course of action back to himself” (ibid.). Aristotle 
should be credited for compiling a detailed notion of human agency by defining the 
nature of action and its relation to intentions, knowledge, choices, and goals 
(Charles, 2017).
2.2  Mind-Body Dualism: Descartes
René Descartes attempted to build a new rational philosophy by rejecting the author-
ity of earlier thinkers, such as Aristotle. His ambitious goal was to follow only those 
statements that are proven to be true with logical rigor. Everything was considered 
false unless proven true. He did not accept Aristotle’s theory of causation and the 
idea that substance integrates matter and form. Instead, Descartes grounded causa-
tion in the mechanics of physical laws. Formal and final causes, both divine and 
natural, were eliminated from his scheme of explanation. Sense organs were 
declared to be unreliable in representing the world. Thus, to Descartes, perception 
appeared to be insufficient for distinguishing true statements from false ones. 
According to Descartes, the only undisputable knowledge comes directly from 
rational thinking, and knowledge’s reliability ultimately derives from one’s trust in 
the truthfulness of God.
The main contribution of Descartes to philosophy was his theory of mind-body 
dualism, which for the next few centuries became the cornerstone of Western ratio-
nal thought (Favareau, 2010a) and modern science. He thought that bodies and 
minds are distinct kinds of substances: the body is material, extended in space, and 
has parts (e.g., organs), while the mind (or soul) is immaterial, not extended, and not 
partitioned. According to Descartes, the human being is, uniquely, a union of body 
and mind, and the mind is more important than the body because it is critical for any 
awareness of existence (“I think, therefore I am”). Descartes thought that in ani-
mals, a body exists without mind, and that such an existence belongs to a lower-­
level type as compared to the proper existence of humans, which are endowed with 
mind. Descartes assumed that the body is material and directed by the physical 
interactions between its parts. This assumption had a positive effect on the develop-
ment of biology, and in particular physiology. Descartes himself was interested in 
the physiology underlying perception and passions and explored the activity of the 
nervous system and the brain. He thought that sensations and passions (e.g., won-
der, love, hatred, desire, joy and sadness) result from the circulation of fluids (ani-
mal spirits) in the nervous system which connects the brain with muscles. He further 
hypothesized that the interaction between animal spirits and the soul is mediated by 
the pineal gland (Lokhorst, 2020). This has long since proven not to be the case.
2  Historical Overview of Developments of Notions of Agency

27
Descartes explored the mechanisms of automatic responses of the body to exter-
nal stimuli, which were summarized two and a half centuries later in the reflex the-
ory (Shiraev, 2010: 87–88). He thought that stimuli such as touch or sound interact 
with the endings of the nerves and activate animal spirits, which in turn reach the 
brain. From there, he thought that the signal was returned automatically (i.e., with-
out thinking) to muscles, and contraction of muscles then causes body motion, such 
as pulling a hand from fire. In other words, he thought that animal movement can be 
fully explained mechanistically.
The philosophy of Descartes was instrumental in supporting the development of 
modern science. He contributed to the development of scientific methods such as 
mathematical reasoning, experimental approach, and mechanistic causation. The 
ontological assumptions of dualism had a positive effect in promoting scientific 
explorations of the body of organisms and physiological experiments. The short-
comings of the doctrine of dualism became evident only several centuries later, 
when science started approaching the phenomena of evolution and cognition, and it 
became necessary to project science beyond mechanisms.
2.3  A Priori Knowledge: Kant
Kant is known for his theory of perception, which is one of the fundamental proper-
ties of cognition. According to Kant (1998 [1781]), our knowledge of the world is 
based not only on experience (sensing) but also on a priori concepts (i.e., concepts 
whose sense can be understood without reference to experience), such as space and 
time. Information provided by sense organs is deciphered and structured by the 
mind and only then becomes comprehendible. In particular, causality and substance 
are examples of a priori concepts that help us to understand the physical interac-
tions of objects. Even recognition of objects is not possible without the mental 
capacity to extract specific information about each kind of objects. Thus, the mind 
is not passively affected by the external world, as the empiricists suggested; instead 
it is actively engaged in perception by taking part in constructing objects and rela-
tions. Bateson explained Kant’s idea as follows:
He [Kant] argues that in a piece of chalk there are an infinite number of potential facts. The 
Ding an sich, the piece of chalk, can never enter into communication or mental process 
because of this infinitude. The sensory receptors cannot accept it; they filter it out. What 
they do is to select certain facts out of the piece of chalk, which then become, in modern 
terminology, information. (Bateson, 1987 [1972]: 460)
This explanation expands the original thought of Kant by assuming that the 
extraction of facts happens not only in the mind but also even earlier – in sensory 
receptors.
The philosophy of Kant is important for us as a turning point which marked a 
departure from pure observations and a development towards practical aspects of 
knowledge and action, which later evolved into phenomenology and pragmatism. 
2.3  A Priori Knowledge: Kant

28
Attaining knowledge, in this perspective, requires the agent’s active participation 
from the very beginning. But the agent’s active role does not need to be exact or 
perfected to be useful. A lot of perception and knowledge is generated simply from 
the structure and framework of the actively engaged mind. Kant’s focus was on the 
human mind – and potentially the mind of angels. The world as it is perceived by the 
human mind – the Dinge-für-mich (the things as they appear to me) – is in this view 
the subject matter of science. In contrast, the Dinge an sich (the things in them-
selves, i.e. the things as they are independently of any observation) are beyond the 
reach of the empirical sciences. This distinction constitutes Kant’s version of dual-
ism, which like Descartes’ dualism prioritizes human agency over any other terres-
trial agency and sees human agency as unique.
A notable achievement of Kant in the analysis of agency is defining “organized 
beings” as wholes that are both causes and products of their parts at the same time. 
He viewed “organized beings” as “natural purposes” that, in contrast to artificial 
instruments, cannot be explained by effective causes alone. He wrote:
In such a product of nature every part not only exists by means of the other parts, but is 
thought as existing for the sake of the others and the whole, that is as an (organic) instru-
ment. Thus, however, it might be an artificial instrument, and so might be represented only 
as a purpose that is possible in general; but also its parts are all organs reciprocally produc-
ing each other. This can never be the case with artificial instruments, but only with nature 
which supplies all the material for instruments (even for those of art). Only a product of 
such a kind can be called a natural purpose, and this because it is an organized and self-­
organising being. (Kant, 1914 [1790]: $65)
Stuart Kauffman emphasized that the existence of Kantian wholes as self-­
recreating units “fully legitimizes the word ‘function’ of a part of a whole in an 
organism” (Kauffman, 2009: 5). Kant’s definition captures the idea of functional 
closure, which in contemporary biology became represented by theories of auto-
catalytic sets (Kauffman, 2009) and autopoiesis (Maturana & Varela, 1980).
2.4  Evolutionism: Lamarck, Darwin and Spencer
Evolutionism emerged from the rapid development of physiology and psychology 
in the eighteenth and beginning of nineteenth century. Initially, the major principle 
of cognition was seen in the human capacity to associate related ideas. David Hume 
developed an empiricist version of this principle assuming that association of ideas 
is formed from associated experiences (“Impressions”). Physicians David Hartley 
and Pierre Jean Georges Cabanis explored the physiological factors that may explain 
the association of ideas. Cabanis connected mental processes to the activity of 
nerves and brain (Ginsburg & Jablonka, 2019: 43). Physiological research uncov-
ered the dynamic and adaptive nature of mind, which was the first logical step 
towards transformism. Ginsburg and Jablonka (2019: 44) wrote: “And if recurring 
behaviors can become habits and finally transmute into inborn behavioral

29
tendencies and even full-blown instincts, as Diderot hinted and Cabanis claimed, 
what stands in the way of species transformations?”
The notion of evolutionism was initially developed by Jean Baptiste Lamarck, 
and caused the major revolution in the study of agency. Bateson described it as 
follows:
Before Lamarck, the organic world, the living world, was believed to be hierarchic in struc-
ture, with Mind at the top. The chain, or ladder, went down through the angles, through 
men, through the apes, down to the infusoria or protozoa, and below that to the plants and 
stones. What Lamarck did was to turn that chain upside down. [...] When he turned the lad-
der upside down, what had been the explanation, namely, the Mind at the top, now became 
that which had to be explained. (Bateson, 1987 [1972]: 456)
The dogma of creation was not fully abandoned by Lamarck because he consid-
ered nature as “the Supreme Author of all existing things” (Lamarck, 1914: 36). But 
it was restricted to the first cause, after which the world developed on its own fol-
lowing principles of science (Ginsburg & Jablonka, 2019: 45). In particular, 
Lamarck thought that the diversity of animal and plant species is a product of auton-
omous evolution, where higher levels of organisms emerged from lower level organ-
isms. Evolutionism brought a new meaning to Aristotle’s gradation of the soul and 
gave a strong blow to Cartesian dualism. Lamarck presented not only the first clear 
formulation of evolutionism but also three important related hypotheses: (1) life 
likely originated from inanimate nature, (2) humans likely originated from animals 
(apes), and (3) the human mind originated from a more primitive form of cognition 
in animals (ibid: 45–49).
Lamarck suggested several hypothetical mechanisms that cause evolutionary 
changes, many of which later appeared to be either incomplete or plainly wrong. 
First, he distinguished processes that increase the complexity of organism (ortho-
genesis) from adaptations of organisms to changing local environments. He errone-
ously attributed the increase of complexity of organisms to the effect of alchemical 
elements. As for the adaptative changes, Lamarck associated them with the interac-
tion of organisms with the environment, as follows from his two “laws of nature”: 
(1) the more organs are used, the more strong and efficient they become, whereas 
unneeded and unused organs diminish and disappear, and (2) changes of organs 
caused by the environment are preserved by reproduction in the progeny (Lamarck, 
1914: 113). Lamarck thought that the effect of the environment is indirect and medi-
ated by the change of needs followed by the change of activities and habits of ani-
mals (ibid: 108). In contrast, plants are affected by the environment via development: 
“In plants, where there are no activities, and consequently no habits, properly so-­
called, great changes of environment none the less lead to greater differences in the 
development of their parts” (ibid: 108).
The second law of Lamarck is controversial because it was later interpreted in 
neo-Darwinism as “inheritance of acquired traits”. To disprove it, August Weissman 
amputated tails of laboratory mice for many generations and showed that progeny 
mice always had normal tails (Weismann, 1889: 432). This experiment clearly 
shows that body parts of parents do not affect the development of their descendants, 
but it does not directly address the second law of Lamarck which is applied to 
2.4  Evolutionism: Lamarck, Darwin and Spencer

30
changes caused by the environment and mediated by habits. Lamarck did not mean 
that parental organs are heritable; instead, he thought that it is the habits that persist 
and affect the development of the progeny (Lamarck, 1914: 114). The nature of 
habits was not known at that time, and thus it is not fare to say that Lamarck was 
totally wrong in formulating his second law. Moreover, habits can be interpreted in 
a broad sense as activity patterns, and then they would include heritable instincts 
and developmental paths. Lamarck cannot be blamed for not knowing genetics, 
which did not exist during his time. His theory of adaptation was the best idea that 
could have been formulated in 1809 when his Zoological Philosophy was published.
Now the writings of Lamarck are revisited because of the emergence of a new 
discipline of epigenetics. Some acquired changes are partially inherited and can be 
preserved for multiple generations, especially if they prove to be useful (Jablonka, 
2013: 101). This kind of “soft inheritance” is supported not by mutations in the 
genome but by so called epigenetic factors (see Chap. 8). Nevertheless, soft inheri-
tance can contribute to the evolutionary process in combination with other factors 
and affect the direction and the rate of change.
Lamarck has contributed to questions that continue to be the leading edge of 
biology, in particular the origin of life and origin of mind. He agreed with Cabanis 
that “the moral and the physical both spring from a common origin” (Lamarck, 
1914: 185), and hence life is a physical phenomenon subject to all physical laws. 
Lamarck believed that life has a natural origin: “Life and organisation are products 
of nature” (ibid: 236). He assumed that life originated long time ago because ani-
mals, plants, and fungi are produced by parental organisms of the same kind, rather 
than being self-assembled from inorganic bodies. He wrote (ibid: 194):
The masses of inorganic bodies consist of separate parts which are united by accident; these 
bodies are not born, nor are they ever the produce of a germ or bud whose development 
gives rise to an individual exactly similar to that from which it springs. All living bodies, on 
the contrary, are really born, and are the produce either of a germ which has been vivified 
and prepared for life by fertilisation, or else simply of an expansible bud. In either of these 
cases new individuals arise exactly like those which have produced them.
Because of this feature (i.e., heritable reproduction or descent) organisms of the 
same kind make lineages, which are rooted in the past evolutionary history and 
may branch:
it is not true that Species are as old as Nature, and have all been in existence for an equal 
period; but that it is true that they have been formed one after another, that they have only a 
relative constancy, and are only invariable temporarily. (ibid: vii)
Lamarck rejected the traditional notion of species as unchangeable units and 
provided reasons why species lineages change and branch by adapting to diverse 
and unstable environments. This discovery led Lamarck to the conclusion that clas-
sification of animals represents the branching evolutionary tree of life. Lamarck did 
not reject the spontaneous generation of life but limited it to the “rudiments of 
organisation”: “nature, by means of heat and moisture, directly creates only the 
rudiments of organisation” (ibid: 236). Note, that Lamarck considered nature as a 
2  Historical Overview of Developments of Notions of Agency

31
kind of agency which he called “the Supreme Author of all existing things” (ibid: 
36). Thus, he did not see spontaneous generation of life as the beginning of agency.
According to Lamarck, animals and plants have many common functions, which 
include feeding, growth, making their own components, and reproduction. Although 
various organisms perform these functions in different ways depending on their 
constitution and modes of interaction with the environment, the principles of life are 
the same for all of them, which justify the science of biology. In fact, Lamarck was 
one of the first who introduced the term “biology” in 1802 (Coleman, 1977: 1–2).
Next, Lamarck applied his evolutionary approach to the study of mental phe-
nomena. Bateson described Lamarck’s approach: “Mind became that which needed 
explanation when Lamarck showed that the Great Chain of Being should be inverted 
to give an evolutionary sequence from the protozoa upward” (Bateson, 1987 [1972]: 
349). Lamarck argued that nervous system is too complex in humans and higher 
animals; thus it is valuable to study it in simpler animals, such as sea urchins, inver-
tebrates, and primitive vertebrates. He hypothesized that a simple nervous system 
can “control and coordinate motor actions but not feelings” (Ginsburg & Jablonka, 
2019: 50). Feelings emerge in more developed nervous systems, where “the head 
ganglion, a true brain [...] was responsible for the integration of sensory inputs that 
produced feelings, and these feelings could then guide and coordinate behaviors by 
communicating with the more ancient motor ganglia” (ibid.). Finally, at the third 
stage, the brain cortex in vertebrates enabled feelings to be combined and reorga-
nized into understanding (or intelligence) that included attention, thought, memory, 
“and judgments, which are the most important acts of the understanding, and with-
out which no reasoning, or act of will could be produced, nor any knowledge be 
acquired” (Lamarck, 1914: xiv).
Lamarck described the pragmatic components of animal activity which include 
needs, habits, instincts, and will. He recognized that animals have needs, which 
manifest a kind of value system or goal-directedness. The basic needs include hun-
ger, sexual drive, avoiding pain, and “seeking pleasure or well-being” (Lamarck, 
1914: 352). Needs and sensing result in new behaviors that become stabilized into 
habits, and habits then turn into instincts, which are “the fixed tendencies displayed 
by animals in their actions” (ibid: 350). Instinct “causes the execution of actions 
without the intervention of any thought or act of will” (ibid: 352). Instincts are typi-
cal for the animals with feelings, whereas will require intelligence (ibid: 355). 
Lamarck added “Even in animals which possess some degree of intelligence, the 
actions are still commonly controlled by the inner feeling and by habit” (ibid: 350).
Finally, Lamarck discussed the origins of intelligence. He emphasized that “all 
acts of intelligence are natural phenomena and hence derive their source exclusively 
from physical causes” (Lamarck, 1914: 362). He followed the principles of empiri-
cism, advocated earlier by John Locke, George Berkeley, and David Hume, that all 
ideas and knowledge are derived from sensing and experience (Atherton, 1999), but 
he is far from naïve empiricism that ideas are direct imprints of observations. He 
wrote: “The organisation must have reached a state favourable to the formation of 
the idea, and, moreover, the sensation must be accompanied by a special effort of 
the individual” (Lamarck, 1914: 365). He assumed that ideas are material traces 
2.4  Evolutionism: Lamarck, Darwin and Spencer

32
formed in cerebral cortex that contains “an inconceivable number of separate and 
distinct parts, from which result a vast quantity of cavities of infinitely varied size 
and shape and appearing to occupy distinct regions, equal in number to the intel-
lectual faculties of the individual” (ibid: 367); today we call them neurons. 
Furthermore, thin fibers in the “white medullary part” of the brain are tiny “indi-
vidual canals” that interconnects the cavities/neurons in the cortex. Except for an 
obsolete terminology, Lamarck’s description of the brain is quite accurate.
Lamarck (1914: 368) contemplates that mental activity results in strengthening 
of the capacity to repeat these acts in the future. In this way, the development of the 
brain follows the same law of strengthening by exercise as other parts of the body. 
Simple ideas are formed “immediately and exclusively from the noticed sensations 
that are impressed upon us by objects” (ibid: 371), however they are formed “only 
when we pay attention to them”, and paying attention requires thinking (ibid: 373). 
Lamarck’s ‘simple ideas’ can be interpreted as mental images which are “actually 
traced and graven on the organ [brain], since memory can recall it at the will of the 
individual and make it perceptible once more” (ibid: 374). In contrast, emergence of 
complex ideas requires a judgment about previously acquired ideas. Lamarck 
assumed that comparison of ideas and drawing judgments upon them is not exclu-
sively a human capacity but also present in “most perfect animals”. It is necessary 
to mention that Lamarck recognized the importance of signs for recollection of 
ideas acquired in the past, facilitation of the formation of new ideas, and communi-
cation (ibid: 378). However, he applied the notion of ‘sign’ only to humans. He 
wrote: “Condillac has successfully proved that without signs man could never have 
extended his ideas as he has done and still does” (ibid: 378). Thus, Lamarck was 
quite close to the idea of integrating biology of cognition with semiotics.
Darwin accepted the major portion of Lamarck’s evolutionism, and strongly sup-
ported the idea about the origin of man from primates. The main contribution of 
Darwin to the evolutionary theory was the discovery of natural selection (Darwin, 
1866). This theory is based on the assumption that evolutionary changes emerge 
from an initial random pool of inherited variation via selective survival and repro-
duction of individuals with specific kinds of variation that helps them in the struggle 
for existence in a given environment. This mechanism can explain the emergence of 
adaptation to a specific climate or specific food that helps organisms to compete 
with organisms that use the same resources. Moreover, Darwin noted that behav-
ioral variation in domesticated animals can be inherited, and thus proposed that 
natural selection can change the habits or instincts in animals. Another brilliant idea 
of Darwin presented in his book The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to 
Sex was that sexual behavior can play a similar evolutionary role as natural selec-
tion – he called this “sexual selection” (Darwin, 1889). Thus, behavioral traits are 
integrated with morphology and physiology not only functionally but also in reshap-
ing the evolutionary change of each other. Also, Darwin argued that group selection 
may have been important for the evolution of altruistic behaviors in human ances-
tors (Ginsburg & Jablonka, 2019: 66).
In his book The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals Darwin fol-
lowed Spencer and Lamarck in his study of the evolution of consciousness (Darwin 
2  Historical Overview of Developments of Notions of Agency

33
et al., 1998). He was convinced that many mental properties depend on the varia-
tions of brains and nervous systems; and as these variations can be inherited and 
selected, so are the mental properties. This belief obviously contradicted Cartesian 
dualism, and bridged the gap between the animal and the human mind. In particular, 
Darwin demonstrated that human emotions have an animal origin, and that they 
play important roles in communication and social organization. He assumed that 
even some invertebrates had such elements of consciousness as feelings, mental 
states, will, and desire.
Herbert Spencer developed philosophical aspects of evolutionism in his ten-­
volume treatise Synthetic Philosophy offering unified principles that can be applied 
to both sciences and the humanities. A part of this series of books is Principles of 
Psychology that includes a theory of subjective experience (Spencer, 1870). In this 
book he used the term representation for mental relations that correspond to per-
ceived relations in the outer world. Spencer analyzed principles of associative and 
reinforcement learning in animals (ibid.). In particular, he thought that pleasure 
activates neural communications routes, which then facilitate the passage of neural 
impulses leading to the same action. An instinct, according to Spencer, can include 
multiple coordinated reflex actions. In the course of evolution, instincts contributed 
to the emergence of consciousness, which includes such components as feelings, 
memory, and reason. Memory retrieval functions as active recollection that may 
involve competition between multiple neural representations. According to Ginsburg 
and Jablonka (2019: 62), Spencer believed that all vertebrates and some inverte-
brates have at least a basic level of consciousness.
2.5  Non-mechanistic Approaches: James and Bergson
The theories of William James and Henri Bergson both rejected intellectualism that 
relied on logic and proof. In this respect they followed the footsteps of Kant (1998 
[1781]) in his Critique of Pure Reason. James and Bergson seem to view logic as a 
human-made epistemic instrument rather than a divine plan of the universe. As all 
instruments, logic may fail occasionally and thus there is a need for alternative 
methods for assessing truth. James proposed a pragmatic theory of truth that 
included multiple criteria such as correspondence between a proposition and the 
empirical world, coherence between propositions and beliefs, and practical conse-
quences of propositions and beliefs (James, 1907, 1954).2 He recognized the free 
will of humans, which in his view involved two factors: chance and choice. A per-
son is given a chance to make a decision, and then he/she makes a non-random 
choice between available options. James characterized chance as involving “inde-
terminism”, an addition to deterministic explanation.
2 James’s pragmatism includes some elements of the pragmatic theory of Charles Peirce, which 
was mostly focused on logical necessity.
2.5  Non-mechanistic Approaches: James and Bergson

34
Another achievement of James was development of pragmatic principles of 
human psychology, including feeling, passion, perceiving, and reasoning. In con-
trast to Spencer, James stressed the active role of the subject in the construction of 
experience, emphasizing the role of attention and will. Ginsburg and Jablonka 
(2019: 73) wrote: “Agency, the sense of having a self that acts in the world, which 
James managed to convey so well, permeates his book”. James defended the idea 
that feelings and thoughts do have causal power. He rejected the notion that con-
sciousness is only a shadow of neurophysiological processes, which are the sole 
causes of organism activity. Consciousness plays an important role in learning 
something new or making difficult decisions; however it disappears when the activ-
ity turns into a habit (Ibid: 75).
The function of consciousness, according to James (1918: 139), is to act as 
“selecting agency” by using a strategy described as “loading the dice”:
Loading its dice would mean bringing a more or less constant pressure to bear in favor of 
those of its performances which make for the most permanent interests of the brain’s owner; 
it would mean a constant inhibition of the tendencies to stray aside. (ibid: 140)
For example, feelings of pleasure and pain are mental tools for making organism 
behaviors more successful. Pleasure is associated with activities that increase the 
chances of survival and reproduction, whereas pain is associated with activities that 
decrease these chances. In contrast to Darwin, James did not consider utility and 
adaptation as objective features of the physical world because organs of an animal 
are equally practical for survival and self-destruction. Instead, utility is experience-­
based or phenomenological feature. He wrote:
In a word, survival can enter into a purely physiological discussion only as an hypothesis 
made by an onlooker, about the future. But the moment you bring a consciousness into the 
midst, survival ceases to be a mere hypothesis. No longer is it, “if survival is to occur, then 
so and so must brain and other organs work.” It has now become an imperative decree: 
“Survival shall occur, and therefore organs must so work!”. (James, 1918:141)
Consciousness is not determined physically to be directed towards chances to 
survive, but as a rule it does support survival due to such experiences as struggle for 
life and learning. We can add that consciousness is not the only carrier/recorder of 
phenomenological experience. Other experiential carriers include the genome, epi-
genetic information, and the immune system.
James elaborates the notion of human agency or ‘self’ by describing its compo-
nents. First, there is a material self that includes the body, immediate relatives, prop-
erty, and environment (especially things created or modified by the person). Second, 
there is a social self – “the recognition which he gets from his mates” (James, 1918: 
293). Because people perceive each other in different ways, a man “has as many 
different social selves as there are distinct groups of persons about whose opinion 
he cares” (ibid: 294). Social self includes such categories as fame, honor, reputation, 
or affection. Third, the spiritual self is “a man’s inner or subjective being, his psy-
chic faculties or dispositions, taken concretely” (ibid: 296). Spiritual self “is what 
welcomes or rejects [...] It is the home of interest” (ibid: 298). And fourth, the pure 
Ego is the sense of personal identity which is a continuity of past, present, and 
2  Historical Overview of Developments of Notions of Agency

35
future selves integrated into a whole (ibid: 330–335). This identity is experiential 
(i.e., phenomenological) and emotional; James refers to it as ‘warmth’. He further 
wrote: “But this generic unity coexists with generic differences just as real as the 
unity. And if from the one point of view they are one self, from others they are as 
truly not one but many selves” (ibid: 335).
Bergson takes a similar stance to James by taking an approach where the mind 
has to embrace reality in its entirety and criticizing traditional approaches to truth 
that are based on formal logic applied to abstract geometrical representations of 
reality. He concluded that the product of pure thinking is only a hypothesis that 
needs testing by action and experience. He wrote: “If we had never seen a man 
swim, we might say that swimming is an impossible thing” (Bergson, 1998 [1911]: 
192). The solution is to “throw myself into the water without fear” and learn to swim.
Bergson realized that philosophy cannot discover anything new if it deals only 
with the known and formalized, and thus the phenomenon of novelty and creativity 
requires non-traditional approaches. Bergson’s revolted against mechanistic phi-
losophy in his book Creative Evolution (Bergson, 1998 [1911]). He rejects Cartesian 
dualism by stating that “theory of knowledge and theory of life seem to us insepa-
rable” (ibid: xiii). In particular, he proposed to study the evolution of life via both 
mechanism and teleology. His theory offers a new concept of time which he called 
duration, where moments are merged into a continuous process, and applied it to 
life with its irreversibility and uniqueness. In contrast, physical objects are either 
stable or moved by external forces, and their states can be repeated by rearranging 
their parts. Thus, creativity is possible only in life that has individuality and history, 
and absent in the “unorganized bodies”, in which “the present contains nothing 
more than the past, and what is found in the effect was already in the cause” (ibid: 
14). According to Bergson, time is not only integrated into life, it is the essential 
part of life: “Wherever anything lives, there is, open somewhere, a register in which 
time is being inscribed. [...] the very basis of our conscious existence is memory, 
that is to say, the prolongation of the past into the present” (ibid: 16–17). Thus, the 
entire past of the organism, including heredity from ancestors, can contribute to its 
present life. Bergson uses Weissman’s theory of germ-plasm to characterize life as 
a river: “life is like a current passing from germ to germ through the medium of a 
developed organism” (ibid: 27). This continuity of past and present is also seen in 
the evolution of consciousness:
Now, the more we fix our attention on this continuity of life, the more we see that organic 
evolution resembles the evolution of a consciousness, in which the past presses against the 
present and causes the uprising of a new form consciousness, incommensurable with its 
antecedents. (ibid: 27)
Life is producing new forms, such as new individuals and new species, which are 
always unique in some respect. This creative process makes life similar to mind: “In 
this sense it might be said of life, as of consciousness, that at every moment it is 
creating something” (Bergson, 1998 [1911]: 29).
According to Bergson, emergence and creativity does not contradict physics and 
chemistry. Moreover, emergent properties and structures can be explained post 
2.5  Non-mechanistic Approaches: James and Bergson

36
factum after a thorough analysis, but they cannot be predicted before they emerge. 
He offers a following metaphor:
A very small element of a curve is very near being a straight line. And the smaller it is, the 
nearer. In the limit, it may be termed a part of the curve or a part of the straight line, as you 
please, for in each of its points a curve coincides with its tangent. So likewise ‘vitality’ is 
tangent, at any and every point, to physical and chemical forces; but such points are, as a 
fact, only views taken by a mind which imagines stops at various moments of the movement 
that generates the curve. In reality, life is no more made of physico-chemical elements than 
a curve is composed of straight lines. (Bergson, 1998 [1911]: 31)
In other words, physical laws work only as approximations in living systems 
because of their uniqueness, and thus, there is always room for deviations from the 
predicted path. However, the deviation is insignificant at short time intervals, and 
thus physico-chemical analysis remains useful for explaining immediate functions 
of living cells and organisms.
Bergson hypothesized that intuition can capture some properties of life which we 
fail to understand by using intelligence. He proposed to take into account both intel-
lect and intuition in the theory of knowledge. For example, the intellect can model 
a city from photographs taken from different angles, and yet it cannot replace the 
value of walking along the streets (Bergson, 2012 [1934]).
2.6  Semiotic Agency
Semiotics (from Greek word sēmeon [σημεῖον], a sign or mark) is a theory of signs 
and their interpretation. The notion of sign has an ancient history; in Greek it 
roughly means symptom in a medical sense (Favareau, 2010b: 8). The first theoreti-
cal analysis of natural and cultural signs is attributed to Augustine, who viewed 
signs as links between the mental world and the natural world (ibid: 7). Philosophical 
interpretations of signs changed through the history of human thought, affected 
sequentially by medieval theology, the Renaissance, the Age of Enlightenment, evo-
lutionism, and modern science (ibid.). Locke defined Semeiotike (Σημειωτικη) as a 
third category of human understanding in the following passage:
All that can fall within the compass of human understanding, being either, first, the nature 
of things, as they are in themselves, their relations, and their manner of operation: or, sec-
ondly, that which man himself ought to do, as a rational and voluntary agent, for the attain-
ment of any end, especially happiness: or, thirdly, the ways and means whereby the 
knowledge of both the one and the other of these is attained and communicated. (Locke, 
1959 [1689]: chapter XXI, pt 1)
In Locke’s empiricist outlook (ibid: chapter IX, pt. 6) all human ideas “depend 
on something exterior to the mind” and have their origin in experience. On this 
grounds, he thought that there are no innate (i.e., inborn) ideas, as it was assumed 
by Descartes. In particular he considers that the human mind is initially set as a 
“white paper, void of all characters, without any ideas” (ibid: chapter I, pt. 2). This 
view however did not preclude him from recognizing fetal experience. His position 
2  Historical Overview of Developments of Notions of Agency

37
is not that humans only have experience after birth, nor that the human mind only 
starts developing after birth. On the contrary, Locke (ibid: chapter IX, pt. 5) states 
explicitly that fetuses “may have Ideas in the Womb” – specifically, “by the exercise 
of their senses about objects that affect them in the womb”, they “receive some few 
ideas before they are born, as the unavoidable effects, either of the bodies that envi-
ron them, or else of those wants or diseases they suffer”. Locke (ibid.) indicates that 
the latter may typically give rise to “the ideas of hunger and warmth […] which 
probably are some of the first that children have, and which they scarce ever part 
with again.” In current science, whether or not fetuses feel hunger is debated, given 
that they are fed through the umbilical cord. The radical empiricism of Locke is 
generally rejected because animal behavior includes many innate reflexes and more 
complex instincts. However, the importance of experience-based learning in ani-
mals was firmly confirmed by behavioral science.
The importance of semiotics was recognized after Charles Peirce defined “semei-
otic” as the formal doctrine of signs on “what must be the characters of all signs 
used by [...] an intelligence capable of learning by experience” (Peirce, 1931–1958: 
CP2.227). Peirce, defined a sign as a triadic relation between a sign vehicle (repre-
sentamen), which represents an object, and the result of interpretation, which he 
called an interpretant (Peirce, 1998 [1893–1913]: EP2.478). However, it is more 
common to use the term ‘sign’ in the sense of ‘sign vehicle’; thus, from this point 
onward, ‘sign’ will mean ‘sign vehicle’ unless it is specified otherwise. For exam-
ple, smoke is a sign of fire and fire is its object. When humans see smoke, they think 
of fire and may interpret it in terms of heat or danger. In another example, a child 
follows the parent’s gaze or pointing hand (sign) to an object and then responds to 
that object emotionally and physically (Kockelman, 2015: 174). Peirce’s object can 
be a material thing denoted by a sign, but more often it is an idea about an object or 
class of objects, which he sometimes called the ground of the representamen: “It 
[the sign] stands for that object, not in all respects, but in reference to a sort of idea, 
which I have sometimes called the ground of the representamen” (Peirce, 1931–1958: 
CP2.228).
Although semiotics emerged as a “doctrine of signs” it is clear that the scope of 
semiotics is much wider than signs alone. Because signs are used to transfer mean-
ings, semiotics cannot avoid the discussion of what meanings are and what their 
relation is to the material world. Finally meanings do not exist by themselves, they 
are always related to agents who use signs to perceive and transfer meanings. An 
important step towards agent-centered semiotics was taken by Charles Morris, who 
proposed a modified version of Peirce’s theory of signs. First, he introduced the 
“interpreter” as the fourth component of sign relations in addition to the sign vehi-
cle, designatum, and interpretant (Morris, 1971, 1977). Morris described the inter-
preter as an agent of semiosis, whereas for Peirce, an interpreter is only a user of 
semiosis/logic. Second, Morris replaced Peirce’s ‘object’ with a ‘designatum’ 
because signs that refer to the same object may have different designate (Morris, 
1971). The same object – a purse – has different designata for a woman who carries 
it and a thief who wants to steal it. A designatum may exist even if the object is 
absent. And third, Morris developed the concept of pragmatics as a branch of

semiotics and linguistics that studies relations between signs and interpreters. 
Pragmatics deal with language embedded in cultural and situational contexts, and 
includes rhetoric, organizing human behavior, negotiations, and other interactions 
mediated by linguistic and non-linguistic signs. It connects the meaning of speech 
with the intentions of a speaker and listener in the specific context of their lives. 
Besides pragmatics, Morris discussed two more branches of semiotics: semantics – 
the relation of signs to objects, and syntactics – the relation of signs to other signs.
2.7  Classical Phenomenology: Husserl, Heidegger, 
and Merleau-Ponty
Phenomenology is the study of mental experiences from the subjective (i.e., first-­
person) point of view. The term phenomenon means things or processes as they 
appear in our experience, and concerns how this experience is interpreted. Due to its 
subjective nature, phenomenology is distinguished from domains of philosophy 
which have traditionally been understood as objective, such as ontology, epistemol-
ogy, and logic. Classical phenomenology in the modern sense of the term was devel-
oped primarily by Edmund Husserl and Martin Heidegger, and was focused on 
human experiences. Thus, phenomenology is distinctly anthropocentric, although 
both Husserl and Heidegger acknowledged that animals, too, have subjective life-
worlds. This is the case even for Merleau-Ponty, even though he took a wider view, 
with his repositioning of subjectivity from consciousness to corporeal experience 
and his closer affiliation with natural science. All these three classical thinkers of 
phenomenology thought that the specifically human form of being provides us with 
an access to the world that animals lack.
At a late stage of his career, Husserl developed a version of phenomenology that 
centered around his perhaps most influential notion in contemporary times, that of 
the ‘Lebenswelt’, the lifeworld (Husserl, 1954).3 The Lebenswelt notion concerns 
life as it is experienced prior to any theorizing.
Husserl’s view on animal agency is, in short, that there are some resemblances 
between human lifeworlds and animal lifeworlds, particularly related to sensory 
experience, but that human agency and intentionality differs from any animal 
agency and intentionality by being much more complex and multifaceted. His open-
ness towards acknowledging and discussing animal agency is clearest in relation to 
the Lebenswelt notion.
The writings of Heidegger were predominantly in phenomenology and herme-
neutics. With his main work, Being and time, Heidegger (1962 [1927]) offered an 
alternative version of phenomenology. In Heidegger’s view, human beings stand out 
from any other thing that exists. Only human beings know that they exist, and thus 
have a reflective attitude towards the phenomenon of being in the world. Heidegger’s

term for the human way of being-in-the-world is Dasein, which is literally German 
for there-being. Instead of referring to humans, he most often refers to the Dasein, 
the being that is there in the world, conscious of its own existence. Heidegger’s 
position is that the human form of existence as Dasein contrasts sharply with the 
animal form of existence, with animals being characterized as “poor-in-world” 
(Heidegger, 1995). They have some agency, and some form of access to the world, 
but this access and agency is of an entirely different and inferior character compared 
to humans’ access to the world. Animals too live in a world, but only human beings 
know that they live in a world, which shapes human lives in profound ways. The 
human capacity for being-in-the-world is part of the relational structure that is dis-
tinctive of Dasein (see Buchanan, 2008: 56–64 and 65–114).
Maurice Merleau-Ponty was more oriented towards the natural sciences and 
empirical studies than both Husserl and Heidegger. In the words of the contempo-
rary eco-phenomenologist David Abram (1988),
Merleau-Ponty was the first phenomenologist to identify the body, itself, as the conscious 
subject of experience. Transcendence, no longer a special property of the abstract intellect, 
becomes in his Phenomenology a capacity of the physiological body itself – its power of 
responding to other bodies, of touching, hearing, and seeing things, resonating with things. 
Perception is this ongoing transcendence, the ecstatic nature of the living body.
By thus shifting the prime focus of subjectivity from the human intellect to what he 
called the “body-subject” or the “lived body,” Merleau-Ponty uncovered the radical extent 
to which all subjectivity, or awareness, presupposes our inherence in a sensuous, corpo-
real world.4
Given this shift of perspective from the intellect to the body of the experiencing 
subject, Merleau-Ponty’s version of phenomenology has an easier path to affinity 
with biosemiotic thinking than previous versions of phenomenology. However, for 
the most of his career, he, too, remained preoccupied primarily with the human form 
of experience. The bodily perspective led Merleau-Ponty to focus on perception – 
illustrated by the fact that his main work (Merleau-Ponty, 1962 [1945]) is titled 
Phenomenology of perception. In a manuscript published posthumously, The Visible 
and the Invisible, Merleau-Ponty (1968 [1964]) theorized about the ‘flesh’ of nature, 
which concerns issues of intercorporeity. Here, in the words of Ted Toadvine (2019), 
Merleau-Ponty discusses “a crisscrossing or a bi-directional becoming or exchange 
between the body and things that justifies speaking of a “flesh” of things, a kinship 
between the sensing body and sensed things that makes their communication pos-
sible.” According to Toadvine (2019), Merleau-Ponty’s notion of flesh “does not 
correspond to any traditional philosophical concept, but is closest to the notion of an 
‘element’ in the classical sense”.

2.8  Hermeneutics: Dilthey, Heidegger, and Gadamer
With its traditional focus on interpretation of texts – initially religious texts and the 
letter of the law – hermeneutics has a clear anthropocentric bias in its orientation. In 
this sense, hermeneutics is a methodology for interpreting texts. Despite some mod-
ern developments that has expanded its scope beyond the study of texts to further 
meaningful phenomena (for an example from the field of biosemiotics, see Markoś, 
2002), hermeneutical studies remain almost exclusively focused on phenomena that 
are experienced as meaningful by humans. This is also the case for the three classi-
cal figures treated here, namely the three German thinkers Dilthey, Heidegger, and 
Gadamer. In its modern developments, hermeneutics encourages self-­comprehension 
and contextualization of knowledge and beliefs, in order to further promote humans’ 
understanding of various phenomena, and thus has a normative aspect as well.
Wilhelm Dilthey (1914–2006) contributed decisively to the current understand-
ing of the study of human phenomena as distinguished from the study of objects of 
natural science. The term Dilthey used in German for the broad field of science that 
is tasked with studying human phenomena was ‘Geisteswissenschaften’, which is 
literally translated as ‘spiritual sciences’. This incorporates both what is nowadays 
called “human sciences” or the “humanities”, and the “social sciences”. The central 
assumption in Dilthey’s outlook on the sciences is that human phenomena can be 
understood whereas phenomena in the natural world can only be explained. In 
accordance with this, the sciences that study human phenomena should in Dilthey’s 
view be autonomous from the natural sciences and apply different methodologies.
Within the human context, a semiotic understanding of life resonates quite well 
with Dilthey’s perspective, since he emphasized the crucial role that meaningful 
phenomena play in the human context. However, as de Mul (2016): 162) observes, 
Dilthey “was reluctant to extend his hermeneutics to non-human life”, and a strict 
distinction between human and natural phenomena is at the core of his outlook.
The circumstances in society are understandable to us from within, we can up to a certain 
point reproduce them based on the perception of our own states, accompanied with love and 
hate, with passionate joy, with the whole range of our affects, beholding the conception of 
the historical world. Nature is mute to us. (Dilthey, 1914–2006: I, 36)5
In Dilthey’s view, human agency is fundamentally different from, and superior 
to, any form of agency that other living beings may have. Human beings can under-
stand each other, including cultural and societal phenomena, due to the possibility 
of a reciprocal understanding. Human understanding is fueled by distinctly human 
self-reflective processes that involve conscious thoughts and affective responses, 
and can draw on historical knowledge that humans can cultivate in common. Nature, 
on the other hand, is “mute to us”  – we cannot engage with it in a similar 
self-­reflective and reciprocal manner. This also applies to humans’ understanding of 
natural phenomena – for instance, human beings cannot, in this view, understand a

41
tree (de Mul, 2016: 163), since the tree is a natural and not a social or cultural entity. 
Dilthey does not even consider the possibility that animals or other non-human 
organisms can themselves understand their circumstances or interpret the phenom-
ena they are faced with (ibid: 163). However, de Mul (2016: 163–164) notes that “in 
the middle period of his development […] Dilthey seems to be more open to the idea 
of an evolutionary continuity of meaning”, in which there could be more of a grad-
ual transition from other types of biological agency to the evolutionary and histori-
cal appearance of human agency.
Heidegger’s contributions to hermeneutics are interrelated with his contributions 
to phenomenology, and his version of hermeneutics is sometimes referred to as 
‘hermeneutic phenomenology’ (cf. Mantzavinos, 2020). Heidegger called for con-
ceiving of hermeneutics first and foremost in the form of what is today known as 
‘philosophical hermeneutics’  – a phrase coined by Heidegger. In his view, the 
human being is distinguished by its need for meaning and search for meaning. 
Meaningful phenomena are centerpiece in human experience exactly because the 
human being requires a sense of meaningfulness. This is also the foundation for the 
human being’s relating to a world in a self-reflective way  – unlike animals, in 
Heidegger’s understanding.
As recounted by Mantzavinos (2020), the centerpiece of Heidegger’s herme-
neutics is
an existential analytic of Dasein, i.e., human existence (Heidegger, 1962 [1927]). The 
meaning of Being should be disclosed as a result of analyzing the unique features of Dasein, 
and Auslegung (interpretation) is proposed as a concrete way of being in the world.
In this view, the capacity for interpretation and understanding is uniquely human. 
‘Interpretation’ as well as ‘understanding’ is here understood as being self-­reflective; 
within Heidegger’s approach, simpler forms of interpretative skills and capacity for 
comprehension do not qualify as interpretation or understanding.
Hans-Georg Gadamer further changed and expanded the modern conception of 
hermeneutics. Partly building on Heidegger’s work and perspective on hermeneu-
tics, Gadamer promoted philosophical hermeneutics, which is focused on how the 
capacity for understanding is crucial for being human. Much of Gadamer’s work 
details and exemplifies how understanding can be reached, and what challenges 
humans encounter in their attempts to comprehend various phenomena. He also 
problematizes the extent to which we can understand people living in different cul-
tures, and people who lived at a different point in history. In Gadamer’s view, there 
is always a potential for achieving a degree of understanding of people who live, or 
lived, in different contexts, but this requires approaching the phenomena from those 
other contexts with the right mindset, and a self-reflective understanding of one’s 
own historical and cultural position and context.
Gadamer’s main work (Gadamer, 1976 [1927]) is titled Truth and method. His 
position is that to model methods for understanding human phenomena on the 
methods of natural science is mistaken. In Gadamer’s perspective, a historical con-
text is implicit, or embedded, in any work made by humans, and any contemporary 
reader or interpreter operates within a “horizon” of meaning(s). In contrast with 
2.8  Hermeneutics: Dilthey, Heidegger, and Gadamer

42
earlier thinkers, Gadamer places the human reader or interpreter on the same foot-
ing as the (human-made) work, referring to the horizon of meaning(s) surrounding 
each of them, and to these horizons’ possible merger once a reader understands a 
work. In this process of understanding a work, the human interpreter’s horizon of 
meaning is expanded by the incorporation of the work’s horizon of meaning(s). One 
possible interpretation of Gadamer on this point is that any human-made work has 
a form of agency in its own right – an agency that can be traced by examining the 
traces the work has left behind in its reception history (i.e., in the way it has affected 
or influenced other works, artistic expressions, cultures, etc.).
2.9  Anthropocentric Existentialism on Agency: Sartre 
and Marcel
Existentialism in a modern sense has its origin in French thought around the second 
world war. Prior to the era of modern existentialism (which some consider as a 
closed chapter), Søren Kierkegaard explored the conditions of human subjectivity 
(Kierkegaard, 1901) within a protestant, Christian framework. His thinking has later 
been characterized as “Kierkegaard’s Christian existentialism” (McDonald, 2017), 
but most historians of ideas distinguish between Kierkegaard’s nineteenth century 
‘existential philosophy’ or ‘philosophy of existence’ and twentieth century ‘existen-
tialist philosophy’. In this understanding, Kierkegaard is a precursor to existential-
ism rather than an existentialist himself.
The field of existentialism is also inspired by, and to some extent overlapping 
with, phenomenology, given the fields’ shared interest in human consciousness and 
experience. In existentialism, however, the main emphasis is on the meaningfulness, 
or lack of meaningfulness, of the life of a human being. Several existentialists relate 
the question about meaningfulness to another central question in existentialism, 
which concerns authenticity, and distinguish between authentic (i.e. true or real) 
human lives and inauthentic (i.e. false) lives. In extension of this concern for the 
conditions for living authentically, existentialism also has a clear affinity with ethi-
cal and political thought. Authenticity was a concern of Kierkegaard, too. In this 
context he is known for his thoughts about the three stages of life that a person can 
go through in his or her lifetime, with an ‘aesthetic’ stage being followed by an 
‘ethical stage’, and finally superseded by a ‘religious’ stage, which Kierkegaard 
considered as the highest, most mature, and most authentic stage of human life.
Jean-Paul Sartre is considered as one of the pioneers within existentialism. 
Already the title of his main work, Being and nothingness: An essay on phenomeno-
logical ontology (Sartre, 1958), makes clear that his existentialism is built on a 
phenomenological footing. In Sartre’s atheistic outlook, the human life is not mean-
ingful in itself – life only becomes meaningful if we make it meaningful by engag-
ing in meaningful life projects. Faced with nothing, it is up to us to construct lives

43
worth living, and societies worthy of existing. In consequence of these views, in the 
second half of his life Sartre engaged in political activities (Flynn, 2013).
A programmatic essay that was declared aloud in Paris in 1945 (Flynn, 2013), 
“Existentialism and Humanism” (Sartre, 1980 [1946]), states that what existential-
ists have in common “is simply the fact that they believe that existence comes before 
essence – or, if you will, that we must begin from the subjective.” In this understand-
ing, human beings are not predefined, as it were – neither biologically nor socially – 
but capable of defining themselves. This distinguishes human beings from any 
artefact with a defined purpose. For these, their essence (i.e. purpose) comes before 
their existence, and they are brought into existence in order to fulfill their purpose. 
“Man”, on the other hand, “is nothing else but that which he makes of himself. That 
is the first principle of existentialism” (Sartre, 1980 [1946]). Sartre takes no interest 
in animals, because he thought that only the human being has the capacity for freely 
choosing how to live. In this view, if authenticity can be applied as a measure for 
animals at all, animals are doomed to live inauthentically.
Adopting a radical perspective, and drawing on his atheist outlook, Sartre (Sartre, 
1980 [1946]) claims that “there is no human nature, because there is no God to have 
a conception of it.” However, according to Sartre, Christian and atheist existential-
ists alike agree that in the case of the human being, existence precedes essence.
What do we mean by saying that existence precedes essence? We mean that man first of all 
exists, encounters himself, surges up in the world – and defines himself afterwards. If man 
as the existentialist sees him is not definable, it is because to begin with he is nothing. He 
will not be anything until later, and then he will be what he makes of himself. (Sartre, 
1980 [1946])
In the context of ethics, Sartre adopts the clear-cut position that human beings 
are capable of freely choosing their values, by making a ‘radical choice’ so as to 
shape their own lives unaffected by tradition and upbringing. In the view of many 
ethicists and sociologists, this is a naïve stand. It is Sartre’s belief, however, that 
only a radical choice of committing to chosen (rather than inherited) values can 
result in an authentic life. People that do not choose their own values are, in this 
understanding, inauthentic. Such people are ultimately deceiving themselves into 
believing that they are free, while in fact they are not, and in Sartre’s view they live 
in ‘bad faith’. Experienced agency does not, in this view, always qualify as authen-
tic, genuine agency. In Sartre’s words (Sartre, 1980 [1946]), a man is not necessarily 
“what he conceives himself to be” – because he may live inauthentically, “but he is 
what he wills”, and is thus ultimately responsible for what he is, what he does, and 
what he represents.
Gabriel Marcel, another central existentialist, is known for discussing the differ-
ence between problems and mysteries (Marcel, 1949 [1933]). Problems are, accord-
ing to Marcel, tangible entities that require a practical approach, and have practical, 
often technical solutions, whereas mysteries are intangible and can only be compre-
hended by engaging with them.
A problem is something which I meet, which I find completely before me, but which I can 
therefore lay siege to and reduce. But a mystery is something in which I am myself involved, 
2.9  Anthropocentric Existentialism on Agency: Sartre and Marcel

44
and it can therefore only be thought of as a sphere where the distinction between what is in 
me and what is before me loses its meaning and initial validity. (Marcel, 1949 [1933]: 117)
Unlike problems, mysteries cannot be solved, or controlled. In Marcel’s view, 
reality has these two different aspects, and any culture, philosophy or understanding 
of life that involves only one of them is one-sided and failing to capture reality in its 
full complexity. This can be read as a criticism of modern, problem-oriented societ-
ies that emphasize technology and material prosperity but neglect or disregard the 
mysteries of life. Marcel’s outlook has implications for philosophical anthropology 
(our understanding of the human), ontology (our understanding of reality) and phi-
losophy of life (our understanding of what a meaningful or worthy life consists in). 
Furthermore, this view implies that there are things that science cannot fully explain. 
“The mysterious”, however, is in Marcel’s view (1949 [1933]: 118) “not the 
unknowable, the unknowable is only the limiting case of the problematic”. The 
distinction between the knowable and the unknowable is in other words itself prob-
lematic. The mysteries cannot be reached by reason alone, but only by way of a 
mindful presence and openness towards experiencing phenomena beyond 
practicalities.
Another key distinction in Marcel’s work is the distinction between being and 
having (Marcel, 1949 [1933]). This is related to our attitude towards life. All humans 
have a body, but having a body is different from being one’s body. Having some-
thing, in this sense, involves objectifying it, whereas being something involves 
embeddedness, engagement and a form of openness to the world that only humans 
are capable of. In the case of the body, the attitude of having implies using your 
body as a tool, rather than respecting it as the locus of your being in the world. 
According to Marcel (1949 [1933]: 167), the human self is in reality “always a 
thickening […] of the body”. But the distinction also applies to how we relate to 
other human beings, and to things in the world. The attitude of having reduces 
everything to things, objectified entities that can be used and controlled, bereft of 
any agency or autonomy of its own. In contrast, the attitude of being entails acknowl-
edging that all human beings co-exist with other beings, in a mysterious world com-
posed of multiple agencies that cannot fully be controlled or even understood 
by humans.
Within semiotics, existentialist thinking has inspired the ‘existential semiotics’ 
initiated by Eero Tarasti (2000). Tønnessen (2017) discusses the relation and over-
lap between ‘existential semiosis’ and biosemiosis. These topics are further dis-
cussed in Chap. 12, “Agentology: Crosspollination of Science and Philosophy”.

2.10  Cybernetic Agency
Before the twentieth century, the only known agents within natural sciences were 
living organisms including humans.6 Although automated devices such as mechani-
cal clocks and counting machines existed since medieval times, they were not 
viewed as agents that were in any significant way comparable to organisms. The 
situation changed with rapid development of technology at the end of nineteenth 
and beginning of the twentieth century. Complex automated devices became used in 
toys, weapons, looms, and engines. Thus, it is not surprising that the idea of 
­automated control was adopted in behaviorism, a theory that reduced consciousness 
to an automaton that regulates behavior in animals and humans. An American psy-
chologist, John B. Watson, wrote:
Behaviorism […] holds that the subject matter of human psychology is the behavior or the 
activities of the human being. Behaviorism claims that “consciousness” is neither a defin-
able nor a usable concept; that it is merely another word for the “soul” of more ancient 
times. (Watson, 1925: 3)
Behaviorism was mostly a North American phenomenon inspired by the prag-
matic anti-intellectual scientific environment at the beginning of the twentieth cen-
tury (Ginsburg & Jablonka, 2019: 77). It assumed that human learning can for the 
most part be reduced to an automated response to a stimulus, known as conditioning 
or a conditioned reflex. Classical conditioning was studied by Ivan Pavlov using the 
dog’s digestive functions as an experimental platform. When the unconditioned 
stimulus (e.g., food) was applied immediately after a neutral cue (e.g., light or 
sound), then the cue turned into a conditioned stimulus by causing the same response 
as the unconditioned stimulus alone. In contrast, the operant/instrumental condi-
tioning means the change of the frequency of spontaneous animal behavior if a 
reward (i.e., reinforcement) or punishment was systematically applied immediately 
after a specific action of the animal. It was first studied by Edward Thorndike (1898) 
and then by B. F. Skinner (1938). In both types of conditioning, animals acquired 
new information processing pathways via redirection of neural signaling. As in 
cybernetics, the research on conditioning ignored the meaning of information, 
which is a mental representation (because it was fixed by experimental design), and 
the study was focused solely on signal processing.
The turning point in the study of autonomous devices was the invention of an 
information measure by Claude Shannon (1948) and formulation of the principles 
of cybernetics by Nobert Weiner (1948), which both happened in 1948. Suddenly, 
communication became the business of machines, in addition to being the business 
of people. The excitement of that time is clearly seen in the comment of Gregory 
Bateson: “Now, at last, with the discovery of cybernetics, systems theory, informa-
tion theory, and so on, we begin to have a formal base enabling us to think about 
6 Here we do not take supernatural agents (e.g., Gods, angels, and spirits) into account, which were 
admitted by many scientists and philosophers, especially before the XXth century.

46
mind and enabling us to think about all these problems in a way which was totally 
heterodox from about 1850 through to World War II” (Bateson, 1987 [1972]: 457).
According to Weiner, cybernetics is a field of science focused on control and 
communication in the animal and the machine (Wiener, 1948). Although the under-
standing of organisms’ bodies as mechanisms has been common ever since 
Descartes, there was no specific technical analog of an organism. Thus, mechanistic 
biology was more of a metaphor than a scientific program. Cybernetics offered a 
new modeling platform for agency which creates a common framework for machines 
and living organisms. First, cybernetic machines are open to the external world, in 
contrast to isolated (closed) classic mechanisms. Openness brings both benefits and 
threats for the agents. Positive effects include receiving more information from 
other agents and/or the environment, and negative effects are being affected by 
undesirable or malicious external impacts. And second, cybernetic machines work 
in the irreversible Bergsonian time rather than in Newton’s reversible time (Wiener, 
1948). This required memory to store records of previous events and actions, and 
precise timing of control actions because delayed signals and responses may have 
destructive effects.
The cybernetic approach resulted in a rapid technological development. It 
resolved a range of practical problems in communication and control such as estab-
lishing reliable transmission over a noisy channel, encrypting messages to make 
them unreadable for the enemy, and optimizing machine functioning. Development 
of silicon semiconductor chips started an exponential growth of processing capacity 
within computational technology. The number of transistors per chip was for a long 
time doubling approximately every 2  years, which is known as “Moore’s law” 
(Moore, 1965). Computers eventually spread to the offices and homes of the major-
ity of people on Earth, and they have populated cars, TV sets, and phones. Computer-­
controlled robots have replaced workers at car-assembly lines, landed on the Moon 
and Mars, and defeated humans at chess and other games. The emergence of 
computational-­oriented disciplines of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Artificial Life 
(AL) indicated that cybernetic agents are real and some day they may become com-
parable in their competence with animals and humans. Von Neumann (1966) have 
developed a cellular automata model of universal constructor designed as a compo-
nent of self-reproducing automata which can be seen as a first step towards AL.
Development of Cybernetics transformed behaviorism into cognitivism by offer-
ing the idea that cognition is equivalent to computation. Ginsburg and Jablonka 
(2019: 91–92) wrote:
The computer metaphor immediately added specific internal semantic states and multiple 
rules of processing to the association of external inputs and behavioral outputs that the 
behaviorists had suggested. The internal “machine” states were now thought of in terms of 
neural symbols equivalent to words or numbers, and the computational algorithms that 
operate on those representational states were seen as thinking. Artificial intelligence (AI) 
was born. [...] A major aspect of the cognitivist research was therefore the construction and 
testing of computational models that were intended to simulate mental operations such as 
deductive reasoning, concept formation, and memory consolidation and to conduct experi-
ments in which humans (usually psychology students) were engaged in processes of deduc-
tion, searching, and matching.
2  Historical Overview of Developments of Notions of Agency

47
In the 1960s, progress in computer technology prompted Hilary Putnam and 
Jerry Fodor to develop a computational theory of mind by assuming that computation-­
like activity of neurons can explain cognition (Piccinini & Bahar, 2013). Daniel 
Dennett is one of the most influential supporters of the idea that consciousness can 
be explained as a computer; he wrote: “The phenomena of human consciousness 
have been explained [...] in terms of the operations of a ‘virtual machine,’ a sort of 
evolved (and evolving) computer program that shapes the activities of the brain” 
(Dennett, 1991: 431). However, John Searle argued that computation is a purely 
syntactic process and cannot perform semantic functions typical for human mind 
(Searle, 1980).
The main limitation of cognitivism is in its narrow understanding of computation 
in terms of Turing machines (in theory) and silicon chips (in practice). Computation-
like processes exist in all organisms but they do not satisfy the formal definition of 
a Turing machine and are implemented in systems with entirely different physical 
properties than silicon chips. Also, these processes are meaningful only if they are 
parts of agency capable of autonomous and purposeful behavior. Thus, several sci-
entists attempted to enrich the terminology and theoretical basis of cybernetics in 
order to account for agency and its properties.
Ackoff and Emery (2005 [1972]) combine a cybernetic approach with elements 
of a semiotic approach to agency. They call their theory of purposeful systems 
“objective teleology”, a synthesis of mechanistic and teleological approaches. In 
particular, they classify all events into reactions that are unintentional cause-effect 
changes, and responses that are intentional actions utilizing internal energy. They 
also emphasize the importance of both causation and production relations that sup-
port the behavior, physiology, and self-reproduction of organisms. The section on 
communication of purposeful systems includes both the information theory of 
Shannon as well as syntax, semantic, and pragmatic relations from the semiotics of 
Morris (1977). However, the theory of Ackoff and Emery is strongly influenced by 
behaviorism. For example, they assumed that purposes are “derived from observed 
behaviors under varied but specified conditions” (Ackoff & Emery, 2005 [1972]: 6).
In the theory of metabolic-repair (M,R) systems Robert Rosen (1972) introduce 
adaptation and evolution into cybernetic models. In brief, he starts with a typical 
cybernetic system, where a set of inputs A is mapped to a set of outputs B by func-
tion f. Inputs and outputs are interpreted as cell components. In addition, the (M,R) 
system includes a repair function (ϕ) that modifies the input-output relation depend-
ing on the output, B, which is a typical feedback loop. Self-reproduction then 
appears as an extension of self-repair. If the repair function is heritable, then the 
(M,R) system can be further expanded into the evolutionary model where repair is 
optimized to support self-reproduction (Rosen, 1991). The notion of self-­
construction closure was further developed within the theory of autopoiesis 
(Maturana & Varela, 1980). Autopoiesis includes the capacity to re-create its inter-
nal organization and adapt to the environment via physiological and developmental 
feedback.
2.10  Cybernetic Agency

48
Von Forrester together with other scientists (e.g., Margaret Mead and Gregory 
Bateson) developed a reflexive and recursive version of cybernetics, known as 
“second-­order cybernetics”. He wrote (von Foerster, 2003: 289):
[...] a brain is required to write a theory of a brain... Translated into the domain of cybernet-
ics; the cybernetician, by entering his own domain, has to account for his or her own activ-
ity. Cybernetics then becomes cybernetics of cybernetics, or second-order cybernetics.
Similar to autopoiesis theory, second-order cybernetics emphasized that agency 
is embedded in its environment, an idea that opens connections with ecological and 
social sciences. This outlook also implies profound changes in the philosophy of 
science because “what is referred to as ‘objects’ [...] in an observer-excluded (linear, 
open) epistemology, appears in an observer-included (circular, closed) epistemol-
ogy as ‘tokens for stable behaviors’” (ibid: 261).
2.11  The Rise of Biosemiotics
Biosemiotics offers a new synthesis of semiotics, evolutionism, phenomenology, 
molecular biology, and cybernetics. Biosemiotic ideas can be traced to the first half 
of twentieth century, when ethologist Jakob von Uexküll introduced a subjective, 
organism-centered approach to meaning. In his book Bedeutungslehre (theory of 
meaning) he proposed that meaning emerges from biological functions (von 
Uexküll, 1982 [1940]). In particular, animals and other organisms develop mean-
ingful models of their environment, their Umwelt (‘environment’ in German), 
where objects are associated with living functions, and thus become functional 
tokens such as food, shelter, or an enemy (ibid.). “[T]he umwelt is the ecological 
niche as the animal itself apprehends it” – explained Jesper Hoffmeyer (1996, 54). 
Von Uexküll argued that animals and unicellular organisms perceive outside objects 
that are relevant for their functioning as meaningful components of the world that 
are linked to the organisms’ behavioral patterns. Some objects are food sources, 
others are building materials, navigation landmarks, enemies, sexual partners, etc. 
These meaningful components are functionally linked to the organism and together 
constitute an Umwelt, which is a subjective7 representation of the organism’s envi-
ronment. Different species interpret the same environment differently, and thus they 
have distinct Umwelten tailored to their living conditions, needs and affordances.
Von Uexküll viewed organisms as subjects competent to interpret their sensorial 
inputs and chose appropriate actions. Meaningful activities (habits) are thus orga-
nized via choice-dependent regulatory feedbacks that connect sensors and effectors 
into a closed functional circle (von Uexküll, 1926, 1957) (see Fig. 2.1). Each sign 
(meaning-carrier) is a part of one or several functional circles that start with the 
7 In this book we understand ‘subjectivity’ in a phenomenological sense, as subject-specific semi-
otic processes. This does not imply that these processes cannot be studied by science, since we 
favor naturalized phenomenology, as detailed in Chap. 9.

perception of a sign and end with the organism‘s action. Von Uexküll (1982 [1940]): 
34) wrote:
Even the simple blink-reflex, caused by the eye being approached by a foreign body, does 
not consist of a mere sequence of physical causes and effects, but of a simplified functional 
circle, beginning with perception and ending with effect.
Umwelt-theory gives a new interpretation of space (see particularly von Uexküll, 
1928). Instead of a Newtonian absolute and transcendental space, Uexküll exam-
ined the functional space of organisms, building on and extending Kant’s notion of 
subjective time and space. Most biologists think that space exists independently of 
the organisms that inhabit it. Uexküll viewed it differently: animals construct and 
organize their living space by establishing relationships between objects and habits.
Further development of the semiotic theory of agency was done by Thomas 
Sebeok who proposed the new field of zoosemiotics8 which is a synthesis of ­semiotic 
ideas of Charles Peirce, Charles Morris, and the Umwelt theory of von Uexküll 
applied to animal behavior and evolution (Sebeok, 1972, 1976). Sebeok discussed 
biological aspects of semiotics and proposed 6 types of signs: symptoms, signals, 
icons, indexes, symbols, and names, three of which were adopted from Peirce. What 
is important here is that Sebeok used the term ‘sign’ in a very broad sense that cov-
ers all cases of signification. This is big step forward from the linguistic approach to 
semiotics, which carries a substantial load of anthropocentrism. For example, 
Umberto Eco initially thought that animal and molecular signals are not signs, and 
do not belong to semiotics (1976). However, later he changed his mind (Kull, 2018). 
Sebeok’s proposal to use the term ‘sign’ in a broad sense has a clear meaning: we 
need to separate semiotic phenomena in living organisms from non-semiotic phe-
nomena in the physical world. Because there is no other term as general as ‘sign’ it 
is natural to expand the meaning of this term to encompass all semiotic phenomena 
from primitive chemical signaling inside living cells to human language and civili-
zation, in line with Sebeok’s ideas.
8 The term was coined in 1963 (Sebeok, 1963). Sebeok initially said zoosemiotics was about ani-
mal signaling behaviour.

2.11  The Rise of Biosemiotics

50
The major talent of Thomas Sebeok was in establishing contacts with scholars 
interested in merging semiotics with natural sciences via preparation of multi-­
authored books, editing of the journal Semiotica, and organizing conferences. This 
collaboration eventually resulted in the emergence of the multi-disciplinary project 
of biosemiotics (Anderson et al., 1984; Sebeok & Umiker-Sebeok, 1992; Hoffmeyer, 
1996; Barbieri, 2008; Sharov et al., 2015), which is a synthesis of biology with 
semiotics that targets “the semiotic behavior of all living things” (Sebeok & Danesi, 
2000). One of the main ideas of biosemiotics is that semiosis (i.e., sign process) is 
coextensive with life. This idea is attributed to Thomas Sebeok, who observed that 
“a full understanding of the dynamics of semiosis [...] may, in the last analysis, turn 
out to be no less than the definition of life“(Sebeok, 1976: 69). In other words, inter-
pretation (in a broad sense) of signs occurs in all living organisms, but not in the 
physical abiotic world. This idea has been also expressed by Prodi (1988 cited in 
Favareau, 2010a, 329): “We think that the threshold for ‘sign’ is situated at the very 
beginning of the biological domain, characterizing its origin and its basic structure”.
The rise of biosemiotics can be explained by three major factors: (1) biologists’ 
dissatisfaction with mechanistic explanations of evolution, development, and behav-
ior, (2) insights in the humanities to the effect that human cognition is grounded in 
the biological nature of organisms, and (3) logical necessity to accept the idea that 
humans are not the only organisms with such agential powers as freedom to select 
actions, a capacity to create, follow, and update goals, and develop meaningful rep-
resentations of the world (Barbieri, 2008; Sharov et al., 2015). Biology has been 
monopolized by mechanistic thinking for more than half a century. Mechanistic and 
structural research became the gold standard representing true progress in biology 
and deserving of publication in leading journals. However, the revolt against the 
mechanistic tradition is growing in many biological disciplines. The Extended 
Evolutionary Synthesis has rejected the dogma of neo-Darwinism that growth, 
development, and reproduction of organisms are passive mechanical processes 
(Pigliucci & Müller, 2010). Progress in epigenetics contradicts the belief that the 
genome is a blueprint of an organism that determines the phenotype (Sharov, 2014). 
Behavioral biology does not any longer accept the idea that human and animal 
behavior can be fully explained in terms of reflex and conditioning. Additional fac-
tors include goal-directedness (Stout, 1996), meaning (DeGrandpre, 2000), and 
thinking (Overskeid, 2000). Neither information nor principles of self-organizing is 
enough to explain life (Brier, 2008). Self-organizing behaviors have to be combined 
into meaningful and robustly functioning whole organisms capable of self-repair, 
self-reproduction, adaptation, and evolution.
Biosemiotics offers a non-mechanistic paradigm in biology, because it is focused 
on the agential properties of life and emphasizes autonomy and goal-directedness in 
the activity and communication of organisms. Many biologists hope to use the ideas 
of biosemiotics as a platform for building theoretical biology (Emmeche & Kull, 
2011). In particular, “The predictive power of biology is embedded in the functional 
aspect and cannot be based on chemistry alone” (Kull et al., 2009:169).
Progress in molecular biology showed that many molecular functions within 
cells resemble coding. One of the pioneers of this approach was Giorgio Prodi 
2  Historical Overview of Developments of Notions of Agency

51
(1988) who proposed the term ‘protosemiosis’ for molecular signaling processes 
that include DNA copying, transcription, translation, and signal transduction. In 
contrast to biochemistry that views molecular processes as purely mechanistic, 
Prodi emphasized that these processes are meaningful and thus semiotic.
Marcello Barbieri continued exploring the semiotic nature of the genetic code as 
well as other molecular codes such as splicing codes and signal transduction codes 
(Barbieri, 2003). He initiated the Code Biology program (Barbieri, 2015), defined 
as “the study of all codes of life, from the genetic code to the codes of language” 
(Barbieri, 2012: 411). Barbieri views genes and proteins as products of molecular 
agents that are controlled by codes. He defines a code as a conventional mapping 
rule between a set of signs and a set of meanings (Barbieri, 2003). For example, the 
genetic code maps triplets of nucleotides of mRNA to amino acids or stop signal. 
Specific agents called “codemakers” (i.e., ribosomes together with the set of tRNA 
and aminoacyl synthetase) convert the encoded message (mRNA) to its meaning 
(polypeptide) (Barbieri, 2009: 21). The arbitrariness of the code is based on the set 
of adapters (tRNA and aminoacyl synthetase). Because many codemakers include 
RNA, Barbieri developed the notion of ribotype as a linker between genotype and 
phenotype. Another kind of agents, “copymakers”, support replication of DNA and 
transcription (i.e., synthesis of mRNA on the DNA template). To describe various 
kinds of sign processes in living organisms, Barbieri developed the concept of 
“three worlds of life”, which includes organic semiosis, based solely on coding 
(e.g., protein synthesis, signal transduction, splicing), animal semiosis which is 
based on coding and interpretation, and human semiosis, which is based on coding, 
interpretation, and language (Barbieri, 2014). Interpretation is a higher-level mental 
process that includes organic codes and neural codes at lower levels. Code Biology 
was initially integrated with other research platforms in biosemiotics, during 
Barbieri’s involvement with the International Society for Biosemiotic Studies 
(ISBS) in the period 2002–2012. In 2007, Barbieri initiated the establishment of the 
journal Biosemiotics (Springer, now Springer Nature), which quickly became a 
major periodical for interdisciplinary papers that integrate biology and semiotics 
and remains so today. Later, with the establishment of the International Society of 
Code Biology (ISCB) in 2013, Code Biology became a fully independent project 
and its interactions with biosemiotics declined.
Biosemiotics is heavily influenced by the humanities, in particular by linguistics, 
philosophy, and general semiotics as exemplified by the works of Charles Peirce 
(Favareau et al., 2017). Peirce’s theory is generally applied to mental interpretation 
of signs; and it can be naturally extended to the behavior and communication of 
animals with brains. However, it is challenging to apply Peirce’s theory to organ-
isms without brains – though this is done by many biosemioticians. To make a con-
nection, it has been assumed that mind-like interpretations may occur in animals 
without nervous system (Hoffmeyer & Stjernfelt, 2016) and even in plants 
(Krampen, 1981). Another path for uniting biology with the humanities is taken by 
Sergey Chebanov (1999) and Anton Markoś (2002), who propose integrating biol-
ogy with hermeneutics – the theory and methodology of interpretation of human 
texts (especially in philosophy and religion). This synthesis is conceived to

emphasize the unity of organisms with their genetic, epigenetic, and ecological 
self-description.
Contemporary biosemiotics has been heavily influenced by Jesper Hoffmeyer, a 
biologist with encyclopedic erudition whose interests included philosophy and the 
humanities (Tønnessen et al., 2019). Hoffmeyer was among the first to focus atten-
tion on the topic of semiotic agency. He emphasized that non-human organisms are 
true subjects: “Living creatures are self-referential, they have a history, they react 
selectively to their surroundings and they participate in the evolutionary incorpora-
tion of the present in the future” (Hoffmeyer, 1996: 51). This self-reference requires 
code duality: interplay of the analogously encoded actions and digitally encoded 
memory (e.g., DNA) (Hoffmeyer and Emmeche, 1991: 127). Hoffmeyer (1998) 
thought that agential properties arise through “a process of asymmetry-formation 
through membrane closing followed by the development of mechanisms for semi-
otic interaction across the membrane”, which are “interfaces facilitating a highly 
regulated exchange of signs between interiors and exteriors”. He argued that the 
asymmetry between an organism and its environment is simultaneously separating 
and uniting: organisms develop models of their environment, and environments are 
in turn changed by organisms. This unity is supported by the “inside exterior” rep-
resented by the Umwelt and the “outside interior”, which is the semiotic niche.
Connecting the semiotic realm and ecosystem thinking in an original definition 
of the concept of semiosphere9 is another important point in the biosemiotic theory 
of Hoffmeyer (1996: vii):
The semiosphere is a sphere just like the atmosphere, the hydrosphere, and the biosphere. It 
penetrates to every corner of these other spheres, incorporating all forms of communica-
tion: sounds, smells, movements, colors, shapes, electrical fields, thermal radiation, waves 
of all kind, chemical signals, touching and so on. In short, signs of life.
In his later work, Hoffmeyer brought to biosemiotics the term “semiotic scaf-
folding” to describe the network of semiotic controls that are tuned to the needs of 
the system and support meaningful interpretation of signs (Hoffmeyer, 2008). The 
term “scaffolding” had been used in a semiotic context before this as well (Wood 
et al., 1976; Bickhard, 2005), but Hoffmeyer was the first to combine the two words 
“semiotic scaffolding” and apply the term to all organisms, in a true biosemiotic 
fashion. The notion of semiotic scaffolding valuably supplements and enriches the 
concepts of semiotic agency, code duality, the ideas of semiotic integration between 
organisms and their environment, and the semiosphere.

Chapter 3
Human Agency
Abstract  This chapter opens the discussion of agency in organisms by starting 
with human agency, which is a bundle of adaptive processes with different time and 
spatial scales that integrate the past and future of specimens of Homo sapiens via 
autonomy and goal-directedness. Despite of the common belief that each human 
being is a singular decision-making unit, human agency is composite, containing a 
family of subagents that make local decisions. Our brain not only supports cognitive 
functions but also controls unconscious processes, such as our heartbeat and breath-
ing. Organs do not simply obey commands coming from the brain, but interpret 
them in the context of autonomous regulation. Brain function includes the parallel 
activity of multiple cognitive subagents (cognits) that are responsible for percep-
tion, action, and integrated tasks. The life cycle of humans involves a sequential 
development of new forms of agency, followed by their deterioration at the stage of 
the elderly. Human embryo development resembles that of most mammals, while 
specific primate and ultimately human traits appear at the fetus stage. After birth, 
instincts become integrated with learned habits; sensorimotor networks get estab-
lished and tuned, followed by a rapid development of cognitive, social, emotional 
and linguistic skills. The historical development of human agency is characterized 
by the emergence of multi-organism social units such as families, tribes, ethnic 
cultures, businesses, and governments. Human culture facilitated the development 
of farming, industry, economy, arts, ethics, and law. The long-term success of 
human civilization depends on such social tasks as reversing and counteracting the 
deterioration of the global environment, limiting population growth and utilization 
of natural resources, and developing favorable life conditions for all in order to sup-
port the creativity, productivity and well-being of individual humans.
3.1  A Family of Subagents
A traditional narrative goes from simple to more complex things. We take another 
approach in our outlining of agents, starting with the most complex example  – 
human agency. This is, firstly, because agential features are relatively weak in 

60
simple systems and therefore not suitable for demonstrating the major advantages 
of agential thinking; and secondly, because it would be difficult for some readers to 
see connections between their own experience and the functioning of non-human 
organisms. In contrast, human agency involves advanced agential features, and is 
experienced by each one of us directly and continuously throughout life. However, 
human agency is multifaceted because it is related to a family of interconnected 
agents rather than a single agent. In general, we distinguish between individual and 
social types of human agency, which are discussed in Sects. 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5 
and 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8, respectively.
A human individual has three major components: its body, its cognition, and its 
niche, and each of these in turn includes several levels of subagents and instruments 
(Fig. 3.1). By ‘instruments’ we mean things that are not autonomous but provide 
additional affordances to human agency upon interaction. The three mentioned 
components are typical for all cognitive animals (i.e., most vertebrate animals and 
some invertebrates) and are not specifically human. The organization of the human 
body is generally similar to that of other mammals, and especially to primates, 
although the human body stands out by being specifically adapted for an upright 
body position and gait. The cognitive organization of humans has some similarity to 
that of nonhuman animals, judging by the activation of homologous regions of the 
brain in similar situations (LeDoux, 2012). Probably the most species-specific com-
ponent of human agency is its niche, which has evolved rapidly together with human 
culture. The niche of nonhuman animals is their physical and biotic environment, 
which can be selected and modified to varying degrees (Odling-Smee et al., 2003). 
In contrast, the human niche is largely human-made and includes various artifacts 
that facilitate human activity either directly or indirectly (e.g., by providing comfort 
and supporting health).
3.2  Bodily Agency
The human body is a hierarchy of organs, tissues, cells, and cell components. In 
addition, the human body carries hundreds of species of microorganisms, making a 
more-than-human whole that has been called a holobiont (Chiu & Gilbert, 2015). 
The number of cells of the microbes in the human body is comparable to the number 
of human cells in the body (Sender et al., 2016). Although most bodily subagents do 
not perform cognitive functions, they are all semiotic in the sense of interpreting 
sensory inputs, hereditary signs, and epigenetic memory signs. By partaking in 
semiotic functions, they can all be seen as “smart” body components.
The human body is active, autonomous, and functions partially independently of 
cognition, which provides the human organism with an executive control system. 
Examples of autonomous bodily activities include the heartbeat, rhythmic breathing 
movements, intestine contraction, wound healing, the growth of hairs, and so on. 
We do not normally experience these activities consciously; but they can be 
accounted for as automated or non-conscious because they are usually not

niche (i.e., ecological and social habitat) of humans. The human body includes progressively 
smaller subagents: organs, tissues, cells, and intracellular molecular agents. Cognition is repre-
sented by a set of cognitive subagents (cognits) implemented as neural circuits, which perform 
perceptual, effector, memory, and integrating functions. One of the integrating cognitive subagents 
can temporarily assume a dominating role (box with thick outline) and repress other integrating 
subagents. The human niche includes environmental conditions, and culture dependent compo-
nents such as artifacts, information, and social structure

controlled by executive cognitive subagents. In rare cases, a cognitive subagent can 
override the autonomous bodily control. For example, we can decide to stop breath-
ing for a limited time or modify breathing patterns. Most people cannot change the 
heartbeat frequency at will, but individuals with special training (e.g., yoga practi-
tioners) can control the heartbeat and some other autonomous bodily functions to 
some extent.
The nervous system is a subagent within the body that provides a rich infrastruc-
ture capable of supporting cognitive functions and innate instincts. Functionally it 
can be compared to the hardware of computers. It is populated by cognitive sub-
agents that are somewhat analogous to software running in the system. However, 
cognition has more diverse functions than computation; in particular, it can control 
the growth and differentiation of the body and the nervous system. For example, 
new neurons and glial cells can join the function of the nervous system. Also, neu-
rons can establish new connections between each other, called synapses, and modu-
late the function of existing synapses. In contrast, computer software cannot modify 
the hardware components such as processors, memory chips, and the wiring 
between them.
The body affects cognition in various ways, and this allows us to state that cogni-
tion is embodied. First, the body includes sense organs that supply sensorial input 
about the environment. Second, it generates internal sensorial signals, including 
pain and proprioception. Third, it includes effector organs such as muscles and the 
vocal tract, which is the organ of voice and speech. Finally, the body determines a 
set of possible activities conditioned by morphology and physiology (Gibson, 
1975). Cognitive functions appear to be inseparable from bodily activity. For exam-
ple, awareness is not a passive state, because it requires movements of eyes and the 
head to function properly (Gangopadhyay & Kiverstein, 2009).
3.3  Cognitive Subagents
Cognition is characterized by multiple subagents represented by distributed neural 
circuits (i.e., networks) in the brain and other parts of the nervous system, which 
perform mental control and execution of certain bodily and cognitive functions. In 
his book The society of mind, Marvin Minsky called them ‘agents’ and provided the 
following example: “Your GRASPING agents want to keep hold of the cup. Your 
BALANCING agents want to keep the tea from spilling out...” (Minsky, 1986: 20). 
We call such cognitive subagents cognits, adopting the term coined by Joaquín 
Fuster (2006). In a paper coauthored with Steven Bressler, he defined it as follows: 
“A cognit is a unit of memory or knowledge made of a network of synaptically 
associated cortical neurons” (Fuster & Bressler, 2012: 208). Although neurons in 
such networks can be located far from each other, the whole network has a specific 
location in the brain cortex and can be visualized by functional neuroimaging 
(ibid.). The only difference between Fuster’s understanding and ours is that Fuster 
considered a cognit as a unit of working memory/knowledge, whereas we take a 
3  Human Agency

63
more general view by treating a cognit as a cognitive subagent that performs auton-
omous agential functions in addition to hosting memory. A neuron belongs to the 
body as a material cell, but it also can participate in one or several cognits and 
recruit new neurons to a cognit in order to replace poorly functioning or dead neu-
rons. We do not attribute neural networks supporting simple reflexes to cognition 
because they function mostly autonomously (e.g., via spinal cord) and more strongly 
depend on the body than cognits.
Cognits are organized into a system that has been described as a cognitive archi-
tecture or schema (Sloman & Scheutz, 2002). All organisms use functional circles, 
which are loops (or networks) of perception and action (see Fig. 2.1), as initially 
described by Jakob von Uexküll (1957). Sense organs and effector organs are com-
ponents of the body that are operated by cognitive subagents specialized in percep-
tion and action, respectively (Minsky, 1986; Sloman & Scheutz, 2002; Fuster & 
Bressler, 2012). It makes sense to classify cognits by their function into perception, 
action, memory, and integration.1 Following Fuster (2006), we consider the follow-
ing components of memory: phyletic, ontogenetic, and cortical connectivity. 
Phyletic memory is the “memory of the species” that specifies genetically encoded 
connections between neurons, ontogenetic connections represent fetal experience, 
and cortical connectivity is formed on the basis of experience accumulated after 
birth. Cognits may carry partially autonomous components (i.e., second-order cog-
nits), which are specialized in  local sensing, action, memory, and regulation. 
Although second-order cognits experience top-down regulation from higher level 
cognits, they are partially autonomous and can engage in conflicts with other cog-
nits (Minsky, 1986). According to Minsky, conflicts are components of normal cog-
nitive activity and are usually resolved either by negotiation between subagents or 
by suppression by higher-level subagents.
Cognitive subagents that integrate the activity of other cognitive components are 
highly heterogeneous. According to Marvin Minsky (1986), there is an A-brain and 
a B-brain. The A-brain, characterized as “reactive”, is responsible for the reaction of 
an organism to incoming stimuli; it executes functional circles by connecting per-
ception with action. The function of the B-brain, characterized as “deliberative”, is 
to control and modify the activity of the A-brain. In addition, Minsky also proposed 
the existence of a C-brain which he characterized as “reflective”. The C-Brain is 
needed to supervise the B-brain and learn new methods of operation. This layered 
scheme has been implemented in the CogAff (Cognition and Affect) project in 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) led by Aaron Sloman (Sloman & Scheutz, 2002). The 
main components of central processing in CogAff are reactive, deliberative, and 
reflective units. There is also, in this scheme, an alarm subsystem that ensures fast 
but less-specific processing of incoming information. This subsystem takes input 
from many external and internal sensors and controls many cognitive components. 
The scheme also includes units responsible for long-term memory, motivation, and 
“personae” (ibid.). The latter unit integrates unique individual experience (e.g., 
1 Sloman and Scheutz (2002) called them “central processing” components.

driving a car, teaching, writing a book). In the CoggAff project, the term “agent” is 
applied to cognitive organisms, robots, and AI software.
Psychological experience, such as general awareness together with choice and 
the execution of ongoing activity (i.e., autonomy), belongs to the currently active 
cognit of the executive type. Although humans have a large repertoire of executive 
cognits specialized in various activities, as a rule, only one of them seems to be 
dominating at each time, which is experienced as “me performing a specific atten-
tive task”. In this way, psychological experience is “centralized” for each organism 
by representing the organism as a whole. This dominance can be implemented via 
processes similar to “lateral inhibition” in neural processing of sensory stimuli (von 
Bekesy, 2017 [1967]). The dominating cognit is experienced as a goal-­sign that 
integrates functional circles and supports motivation for activity and anticipation of 
results. Selecting a goal is a cognitive action; and thus, what we perceive as free will 
appears to be a special case of cognitive autonomy. Humans mostly select their 
actions consciously. However, unconscious initiation of actions is also possible, for 
example with the operation of a simple reflex or in sleep walking.
The functional aspect of human cognition concerns the development and opera-
tion of the phenomenological subjective world, which, according to von Uexküll 
(1921), has an inner and an outer component called the ‘Innenwelt’ and ‘Umwelt’, 
respectively. The Innenwelt represents the internal functional organization, includ-
ing subagents and their interactions which support sensing, phylogenetic memory 
(via the genome), ontogenetic memory (i.e., epigenetic and neural), habits, and 
internal models of reality. The Umwelt represents outer objects and associated agent 
activities, and can be understood as a projection of internal models onto the sur-
rounding world. The subjective world, made up of the Umwelt and Innenwelt of an 
organism, is an interface by which agents interact with their actual physical environ-
ment, which von Uexküll (1921) called the ‘Umgebung’.
3.4  The Human Niche
Humans live and function normally in a specific range of conditions called niche, 
which includes the environment (i.e., ecological niche), human artifacts, semiotic 
factors (information and communication), and social conditions (Fig.  3.1). The 
niche is an important component of agency because it is interconnected with the 
body and cognition via feedback loops. Human body adapts to the physical and 
ecological factors via evolution and individual development. Cognition creates rep-
resentations of meaningful components of the environment; and the complexity of 
the niche stimulates learning, awareness, and goal-directed activities. Niche also 
depends on the body and cognition because humans actively construct their niche 
by making or acquiring artifacts (e.g., a house, car, or computer), developing meth-
ods of supplying resources (e.g., food, fuel, building materials), establishing social 
relations with others, and contributing to human culture, technology, and economy. 
Also, humans can relocate into a new physical and cultural environment. Niche

construction and change is typical for all living organisms, and thus it is not a spe-
cifically human feature. Quoting Lewontin (1983: 280), “organisms do not adapt to 
their environments; they construct them out of the bits and pieces of the external 
world.” Niche construction is described as “the process whereby organisms, through 
their metabolism, their activities and their choices, modify their own and/or each 
other’s niches” (Odling-Smee et al., 2003: 419). However, the predominating role of 
cultural factors within the niche is probably specific to humans; in other words, 
culture is the human ecological niche (Hardesty, 1972).
Human niche includes many dependent and independent agents. The most 
important are other human beings linked to the person by various kinds of ties: rela-
tives, friends, co-workers, doctors, teachers, and social workers. Dependent organ-
isms of other species include domesticated organisms, such as cultivated plants, 
livestock animals, and pets. The microbiome is another biotic component of the 
human niche, but it can also be seen as a part of the body. Non-living human-­
dependent agents are autonomous mechanisms (cars, planes, computers, and 
robots). Other non-agential components of the human niche are properties, 
resources, and tools.
The niche is sometimes defined as “the role an organism occupies in an ecosys-
tem” (Pinker, 2010: 8993), which means more than the range of external conditions. 
In this respect, human cognitive capacities create new functional roles, and thus 
were considered a “cognitive niche” by Tooby and DeVore. They wrote: “By enter-
ing it [cognitive niche], humans have made available to themselves thousands of 
new plant and animal prey species” (Tooby & DeVore, 1987: 209). This idea reem-
phasizes the interaction between three components of human agency: body, cogni-
tion, and niche. In particular, the niche can be extended by cognitive development 
alone even before anything changes in the environment.2 Lorenzo Magnani (2009) 
developed this idea further by considering ‘cognitive niche construction’ as a factor 
of human evolution. He wrote: “humans can be considered chance seekers, because 
they are continuously engaged in a process of building up and then extracting latent 
possibilities to uncover new valuable information and knowledge” (ibid: 319). In 
other words, humans not only take from the environment what is available, but also 
experiment with the environment to uncover new possibilities that were not avail-
able before.
3.5  Development of Human Agency Through the Lifetime
We have argued above that human agency is an adaptive process that integrates past 
and future via autonomy and goal-directedness. Here we are ready to add another 
dimension to this process: which is a slower component called a life cycle. As Earth 
2 Here we mean no initial effect on the environment, whereas subsequent interaction may affect the 
environment.
3.5  Development of Human Agency Through the Lifetime

66
combines a fast rotation around its axis with a slower rotation around the sun, the 
life of a human combines its fast everyday activities with a slow progression through 
the life cycle from egg to embryo, fetus, infant, toddler, young child, teenager, adult, 
and elderly stages. In terms of semiotic agency, the life cycle is a sequential devel-
opment of new forms of agents, followed by their deterioration at the elderly stage. 
Following the life cycle, “we gradually individuate and become first animal [as a 
more or less generic embryo], then human [as a fetus], then eventually persons [as 
infants, children, and adults]” (Tønnessen, 2014: 291).
Human agency is a developmental capacity that is never static. Furthermore, 
what we regard as typical human capabilities does not apply to all human individu-
als at any point in their lives, since several agential capabilities only appear at cer-
tain life stages. While the normal development of a human organism implies that 
human agential capacities progress and mature over time, agential capacities can 
also deteriorate, either suddenly or gradually. The latter often happens to some 
extent in the life stage of the elderly, though the individual variation on this point is 
considerable. Within a normal developmental trajectory, the cognitive functioning 
of a human being progresses over several early life stages until it reaches full matu-
rity in early adulthood. Under healthy circumstances, this is reflected in a normal 
process towards increased and enhanced agential capabilities which can, however, 
be interrupted at any time, if the developmental trajectory takes a pathological turn.
3.5.1  Embryo and Fetus
The specifically human agential features of the human organism develop gradually, 
in several stages. At the embryonic stage, humans are in some respects almost indis-
tinguishable from the embryos of several other animal species, and the developmen-
tal logic at work also resembles that which is found in the ontogeny of other 
organisms. At this stage a human being has a rudimentary embryonic Umwelt set on 
a predefined trajectory that does not yet involve any perceptual semiosis (Tønnessen, 
2014). As the embryo develops into a fetus, the developing organism acquires senses 
that emerge one at a time, starting with the tactile sense. From this point onwards, 
“the developing organism is not only physically one but furthermore experientially 
one, and thus capable of responding by conducting actions ranging from simple 
reflexes to more complex behaviors” (ibid: 291). At the fetal stage, the fetal medium, 
i.e. the womb, largely determines what kind of subjective experience is attainable, 
along with the physiological development of the fetus. Human sociality starts with 
the forming of the first interactive relation, between the fetus and its mother.
Fetal experiences has been acknowledged in philosophy starting from John 
Locke, who assumed that fetus can accumulate some “ideas” from sensing its envi-
ronment in the womb (Locke, 1959 [1689]: chapter IX, pt. 5). Judged by today’s 
scientific knowledge, Locke somewhat underestimates the range of experiences and 
behaviors a human fetus can display, when indicating that “a FOETUS in the moth-
er’s womb differs not much from the state of a vegetable” (ibid: chapter I, pt. 21). 
3  Human Agency

67
The current consensus is that “[t]he fetus may be aware of the body, for example by 
perceiving pain. It reacts to touch, smell, and sound, and shows facial expressions 
responding to external stimuli” (Lagercrantz & Changeux, 2009: 255). The fetal 
brain starts responding to low frequency noise as early as at 16 weeks of gestation, 
whereas olfaction and hearing become developed by 28–29 weeks of gestation (ibid: 
257). Moreover, “[n]ewborn infants remember sounds, melodies, and rhythmic 
poems they have been exposed to during fetal life” (ibid.). However, “the fetus is 
almost continuously asleep and unconscious partially due to endogenous sedation” 
(as controlled by neuromodulators, ibid: 256), and then becomes more awake at birth.
3.5.2  Infant and Toddler
The first phase of life after birth is called infancy and is followed by toddlerhood. 
Though definitions vary, infancy can be taken to cover approximately the first year 
of life after birth, whereas toddlerhood covers the period from 1 to 3 years or so. 
Taken as a whole, this is a period of significant and rapid development in cognitive, 
social, emotional and linguistic skills, accompanied by rapid physiological growth 
and motor skills development. The event that first and foremost distinguishes tod-
dlers from infants is learning to walk.
According to Locke (1959 [1689]: chapter III, pt. 2), newborn humans do not 
carry innate ideas, except for “some faint ideas of hunger, and thirst, and warmth, 
and some pains, which they may have felt in the womb”. The visual space of new-
borns is very limited, which means that only a few objects are experienced as being 
near or far away in visual terms. Von Uexküll (2010 [1934/1940]: 66), called it the 
“farthest plane”. The first agential experiences of a baby come from senses which 
are both external (sight, smell, hearing, taste, touch, and vestibular) and inner senses 
(hunger, thirst, pain, cold/hot, and proprioception). Although newborn babies can 
track objects with their eyes, they do not memorize them or keep in memory for a 
short time only. Much of their activity is based on innate reflexes such as rooting 
(turning head towards a touch to a cheek or lips), sucking (milk feeding), and startle 
response (Moro reflex).
Two life cycle strategies are known in mammals: precocial species, such as 
ungulates or primates, are relatively mature and mobile from the moment of birth, 
whereas altricial species, such as most carnivores, many insectivores and rodents, 
and all rabbits “give birth to small neonates that have closed eyes and ears, and no 
hair, are generally poorly developed, and are dependent on maternal care for a long 
lactation period” (Starck & Ricklefs, 1989: 23). The Umwelt of precocial animals is 
functional from the outset in the sense that there are functional circles in operation 
from birth, at minimum making them capable of navigating in their natural medium 
(Tønnessen, 2014: 282). This gives them a degree of independence from their par-
ents from the outset. In comparison, the Umwelt of neonates of altricial animals is 
sense-saturated, as that of precocial animals, but their independence is practically 
3.5  Development of Human Agency Through the Lifetime

68
nil and in their Umwelt there are few functional circles in reliable operation, apart 
from the capability of receiving nutrition from their mother/parents.
The categorization of the human infant in this context is not entirely straightfor-
ward. Martin (2013: 128) remarks that “aside from brain development, newborn 
human infants are in most other respects like other precocial offspring”, e.g., as 
other primates. This is often expressed by stating that the human being is primarily 
precocial, but secondarily altricial (Portmann, 1969, 1990). The physiological 
development of the human brain is in this view what distinguishes human ontogeny 
in infanthood. Dunsworth et al. (2012, 15212) observe that:
Humans differ from other primates in terms of neonatal development. Our neonates are 
born with the least-developed brains of any primate, with brains less than 30% of adult size. 
As a result, although human newborns are precocial in other respects, our neonates are 
neurologically and behaviorally altricial.
For this reason, a newborn human being is in behavioral terms just as helpless as 
the neonates of several altricial animals, and just as dependent on motherly care. 
The implications of this are profound. From the parents’ point of view, the depen-
dency of human newborns has probably to a considerable degree shaped human 
sociality, by necessitating pair-bonding and allo-parenting (i.e., care given by other 
individuals than the parents) and stimulating capabilities of caring (Dunsworth 
et al., 2012: 15212, see also Kenkel et al., 2016). But the implications are even more 
profound for early human development with regard to cognitive capabilities. 
“Human infants”, as Martin notes (2013: 128), “are unusual in having open eyes and 
ears during a yearlong period of fetal-type brain growth after birth”, a developmen-
tal feature that has been “hugely influential in the gradual emergence of greater 
adaptability and behavioural flexibility during human evolution”. Portmann (1990: 
132) highlighted the importance of the human infant’s flexible learning capabilities 
by “designating this first year after birth as the ‘year in the social womb.’” Without 
this developmental trait, it might not have been possible for human infants and tod-
dlers to adapt so flexibly to different languages and cultures, depending on which 
context and social environment they grow up in.
In evolutionary history, the truncated human gestation may have emerged as a 
solution to the obstetrical dilemma human beings face. Briefly told, “selection pres-
sures on locomotor requirements and encephalization” and a “continued pressure 
for increased adult brain size” resulted in a natural selection that “favored mothers 
who birthed babies earlier in fetal development while still small enough to escape 
the narrow birth canal”, in effect pushing “fetal brain size to the functional limits of 
hominid mothers’ bipedal-adapted pelvis” (Dunsworth et al., 2012: 15212).
As Zlatev observes (2018: 10), “in the first months of human life”, a “differentia-
tion between the subjectivity of the communicator and the audience” is lacking. For 
instance, there are indications that a newborn does not distinguish clearly between 
itself and its mother. This differentiation, Zlatev claims, is a presupposition for the 
ability to communicate intentionally with others. The bodily interaction of infants 
with their parents or others is in this view a form of pre-communication rather than 
3  Human Agency

69
communicative in nature. As a child matures, it starts communicating, and “with 
communication, a whole new dimension of normativity emerges, given that com-
municative, other-directed acts can succeed, leading to shared intentionality” 
(Zlatev 2018: 10).
During infancy, a human being goes through a series of Umwelt transitions, 
related to e.g. the birth event, breast feeding, eating, tactile and gustatory explora-
tion of objects, sleep patterns, sitting, crawling and walking, and starting to learn a 
language (Tønnessen, 2014: 297). The Wirkwelt (world of action) of the infant is 
characterized e.g. by sucking reflex and grasp reflex, gradually fine-tuning of facial 
expressions, gestures, and vocalizations, voluntary sucking and grasping; and a 
gradually more mature coordination of hands, feet and eventually the whole body 
(ibid: 300). Infants spend significant time moving legs or arms, and this practice is 
important for sensorimotor integration. Physical activity and related sensations help 
babies to explore the ability of their organs, and remains the center of attention 
through the toddler age.
According to Erikson (1980), each new stage in a human life cycle is “character-
ized by a period of development during which the child must resolve a psychosocial 
crisis (turning point) in order for him or her to mature in terms of ego identity and 
related ego strengths or virtues” (Poole & Snarey, 2011: 599) (Table 3.1). The stage 
of infancy is in this scheme predominated by issues of trust and mistrust, as the 
infant relies heavily on others and relates to caregivers. The toddler stage is pre-
dominated by an emerging sense of autonomy and self-control, related to “muscular 
maturation, verbalization, and locomotion” (ibid: 600).
Views differ on at what point an infant or toddler can be said to be endowed with 
consciousness, and particularly with self-reflective consciousness. The most

common conceptions of consciousness, which emphasize the occurrence of subjec-
tive experience drawn from sensory experience, imply that human newborns are 
conscious. Other views, however, diverge radically from the most commonly held 
view. One reason for this is that there are different conceptions of consciousness. 
Furthermore, the self-reflective consciousness that is typical of most mature, i.e. 
adult human beings arguably develops in stages, rather than appearing at any one 
specific point in human ontogeny. At the age of toddlers, the capacity for self-­
reflectivity has started to appear, but only in a rudimentary form. For instance, a 
2-year-old is usually able to recognize itself in a mirror. As toddlers learn to inte-
grate and combine perceptions and actions, they become aware of their thinking and 
learning and explore their agential capacities. Such emerging self-reflectivity is 
facilitated by neural plasticity (Maffei, 2012), which entails that the toddler’s expe-
rience and environment can induce long-term changes in neural circuits and affect 
developmental trajectories. In humans and non-humans alike, neural plasticity is 
particularly high in early developmental stages that are critical for further develop-
ment (Berardi et al., 2015).
As they develop further, toddlers extrapolate their own reflexive thinking to other 
people, and start recognizing the agential nature of their parents and caregivers. This 
is an important step towards developing communicative skills and advanced social 
interaction. Their actions become directed to the observer and listener. Infants and 
toddlers cry not just because of pain or hunger but also to get attention, love, and 
care from grownups. Early childhood is often called a mirror stage, because infants 
and toddlers develop their agential features via interaction with others (Evans, 
1996). They imitate movements and sounds and ask for objects that are shown to 
them. We disagree with Tooley (1972: 60), who suggests that infants are not self-­
conscious, since in his judgment they do not possess “the concept of a self as a 
continuing subject of experiences and other mental states”. The infant’s tactile 
experience with and exploration of the difference between touching itself (self-­
touch), touching or being touched by others (other-touch) and touching or being 
touched by an object (object-touch) likely amounts to a stepwise identification of a 
self/nonself distinction (for an experiment involving these various forms of touch in 
adults, cf. Boehme et al., 2019).3 In a biosemiotic perspective, this can be under-
stood as discovering and recognizing the boundary of the self as an entity in a social 
setting with others, and as a material entity in an environment enveloping animate 
others and inanimate objects, by way of exploring the physical boundary of one’s 
own body. It can also be understood as an exploration of the inner/outer boundary, 
with the infant and toddler gradually improving its ability to distinguish between 
signals from itself (self-touch) and signals from the outside (other-touch and 
object-touch).

and their surroundings starts already in the womb.

3.5.3  Young Child and Teenager
According to Zlatev (2015: 1047), “Jean Piaget and Lev Vygotsky, each adopted a 
kind of cognitive–semiotic approach” to child development. Specifically, Piaget 
investigated “interrelations between sensorimotor skills, imitation, imagination, and 
communicative signs”, whereas Vygotsky investigated interrelations “between 
thought, ‘inner speech‘, and the semiotic mediation of cognition and development 
by socio-culturally transmitted sign systems” (ibid: 1048). Piaget is credited with 
his theory of child psychological development that happens in age-related stages 
(Matthews & Mullin, 2020). A normal or healthy development will in this view fol-
low four stages: sensorimotor (0–2 years), preoperational (2–7 years), concrete 
operational (7–11 years), and formal operational stages (11 years and over) 
(McLeod, 2018).
After toddlerhood, Erikson’s stages of the life cycle (Table 3.1) involve the pre-
school stage, which is characterized by “conflicts of initiative versus guilt” (Poole 
& Snarey, 2011: 600), and the stage of the ‘school age’, which is characterized by 
an eagerness to learn and conflicts related to industriousness versus inferiority 
(ibid.). The fifth stage, adolescence, is predominated by identity formation, and con-
flicts related to identity issues (ibid: 601).
During the two years after toddlerhood, at age 3–4, the child’s capacity for self-­
reflectivity matures significantly. Experiments have shown that most 4-year-olds are 
able to distinguish between their own knowledge and other people’s knowledge, 
whereas younger children have difficulties with making a similar distinction (Frith 
& Happé, 1999). This concerns the child’s ability to attribute mental states to itself 
and to others, and is regarded as a requirement for a mature self-reflectivity. But a 
mature form of self-reflectivity also draws on experience, further development of 
intellectual abilities, etc.
Lawrence Kohlberg’s idea (1968, 1982) about the stages of moral development 
during childhood also supports the understanding that self-reflectivity develops in 
steps and gradually matures over time. According to Kohlberg (1982: 34–35), moral 
development happens in six stages, reaching the sixth and final stage towards the 
end of adolescence or in early adulthood (Table 3.2). The first two stages are said to 
be at a pre-conventional level, typically occurring at the age of 4–10 years. The first 
stage is characterized by heteronomous morality, with the child being motivated 
primarily by avoiding punishment. The second stage is characterized by individual-
ism, instrumental purpose, and exchange, with the child being motivated by its own 
interests, and a sense of fairness drawn from comparison with others. The next level 
is the conventional level, which includes a third stage characterized by mutual inter-
personal expectations, relationships, and interpersonal conformity, and a fourth 
stage focused on social systems and conscience. At this level, the human being is 
motivated by being seen as a good person, maintaining rules and caring for others 
(stage 3), and subsequently by supporting institutions and societal structures (stage 
4). In the latter stage the individual is able to relate moral judgments to what is 
deemed to be best for society rather than just to interpersonal agreement. The third 
3.5  Development of Human Agency Through the Lifetime

72
and final level is the post-conventional level, also called the principal level, which 
involves a fifth stage focused on a social contract or utility and individual rights, and 
a sixth level focused on universal ethical principles. While at the fifth stage the indi-
vidual is motivated by a sense of obligation derived from an understanding of a 
social contract that exists for the good of all, the sixth and highest stage is character-
ized by personal commitment to and belief in the validity of universal moral 
principles.
The child’s experience and behavior develop significantly during childhood and 
adolescence due to processes of maturing, and this does not only concern cognitive 
and moral development, but also perceptual experience. In von Uexküll’s A Foray 
into the Worlds of Animals and Humans (von Uexküll, 2010 [1934/1940]: 67), there 
is an illustration showing a church as seen by a child and an adult (see Fig. 3.2). He 
writes that we must think of animals and humans “as having a soap bubble around 
them, closed on all sides, which closes off their visual space and in which every-
thing visible for the subject is also enclosed” (ibid: 69). According to von Uexküll 
(ibid: 63) visual space is enclosed by an “impenetrable wall, which we shall call the 
horizon or the farthest plane”. Only objects that are within the perceived horizon are 
experienced as being near or far away; objects beyond the horizon are instead expe-
rienced as small or large in a more static manner. The point with the illustration is 
to disseminate that objects in the environment have “entirely different dimensions” 
in the Umwelten of children and adults, with children having closer horizons than 
adults. This is the reason why people who revisit a house they lived in or spent time 
in when growing up in adult age may be surprised about how they now perceive the 
size of the place.

3.5.4  Adult
In early adulthood, a human being’s capacity for self-reflective consciousness 
reaches full maturity. In the mid-twenties, the brain is fully developed. If the indi-
vidual has reached the most mature stage of moral development according to 
Kohlberg’s scheme (Kohlberg, 1968, 1982), it now applies moral judgment by relat-
ing self-consciously and rationally to universal moral principles. Alternatively, in 
Gilligan’s outlook (1982), the individual’s ability to care for and about others is now 
fully mature.
Though primarily concerned with child development, Erikson’s stages of the life 
cycle also include adult life stages. The sixth stage, young adulthood, is character-
ized by conflicts related to intimacy versus isolation, often related to romance and 
relationship issues (Poole & Snarey, 2011: 601), while the seventh, middle adult-
hood, is characterized by a psychosocial preoccupation with generativity and stag-
nation. In this latter phase a human being is typically concerned with contributing 
to society and to its family, including contributing to the next generation by mentor-
ing them (ibid: 601).
Examples of Umwelt experience in von Uexküll’s theory mostly involve adult 
organisms. In the human species and many other species, it is only adults that have

of an adult (in the bubble) 
and a child (above). (From

74
fully developed Umwelten. In a modern society, the adult human Umwelt often 
includes profession-specific components that develop as the individual is trained or 
educated for a profession or gains experience by practice. Von Uexküll’s analysis of 
profession-specific Umwelten is treated in Sect. 3.8 “Social Regulation: Ethics, 
Economy, and Law”. Some other central features of adult human agency in a his-
toric perspective are treated in Sect. 3.6 “Development of Human Agency in 
Historical Perspective”.
People use different strategies in setting goals, expectations, expressing emo-
tions, and interacting with others; these differences are often called temperaments 
or personalities. Galen (Galenus), a Greek physician and philosopher, distinguished 
four temperaments (sanguine, phlegmatic, choleric, and melancholic) and associ-
ated them with four body fluids (humors). A sanguine person prefers exploration 
and multitasking, whereas a choleric prefers to concentrate on a single top-level 
goal. Phlegmatic person emphasizes keeping the order and avoiding conflicts, and a 
melancholic gives a priority to established traditions and habits. The former two 
types tend to enjoy their autonomy and take an active stance in life, which is now 
known as type A personality (Friedman & Booth-Kewley, 1987). The latter two 
types have a reduced sense of autonomy and are more likely to “go with the flow”; 
these belong to type B personality. Interestingly, men with type A personality had a 
higher risk of coronary heart disease than men with type B personality (ibid.). An 
alternative approach in evaluating personalities is measuring quantitative psycho-
logical traits based on questionnaires. For example, personality can be evaluated by 
a combination of five traits: openness, neuroticism, agreeableness, extraversion, and 
conscientiousness (Rothmann & Coetzer, 2003).
3.5.5  Elderly
Old age is a phase that can be experienced very differently depending on a person’s 
health and psychological condition. The commencement of old age is usually 
defined in terms of chronological age. Possibly due to societal norms concerning 
work life participation and retirement, “in many Western societies, 60–65 is looked 
upon as the threshold of old age” (Akman, 2009). This is also “an age at which 
degenerative changes of aging become noticeable.” Alternatively, old age is some-
times approached in terms of functional age, “depending on their performance in 
relation to age-graded norms” (ibid.). A 70-year-old can thus function e.g. like a 
60-year-old or like an 80-year old, depending on his or her actual physical and men-
tal conditions. As Akman remarks, “old age may be a time with significant chal-
lenges, especially for those with health problems, but it is not a time when quality 
of life and adjustment are inevitably poor” (ibid.). However, for people over the age 
of 85, social isolation is quite common (ibid.). Theories on the psychology of aging 
have developed from classical theories about personality, activity level and disen-
gagement among elderly people, to modern theories about life-span distribution, 
behavioral genetics and gerotranscendence (Shroots, 1996), with the latter 
3  Human Agency

75
promoting a positive view on aging based on elderly people’s potential for achiev-
ing wisdom and a mature and reflective understanding of their past experience.
According to Erikson’s stages of the life cycle, the final stage, of the older adult, 
is characterized by conflicts related to integrity versus despair (Poole & Snarey, 
2011: 602). The older adult is in this scheme concerned with facing death and judg-
ing whether his or her life has been meaningful. Integrity is developed by “the one 
who has taken care of things and people, and has adapted himself or herself to the 
triumphs and disappointments of being” (ibid: 602).
Atef (2010: 31) notes that elderly people “do not experience ageing as uniformly 
negative.” “Physical confidence tends to decrease with age,” he notes (ibid: 29), 
referring to the work of Heim (1990), “whereas mental and social confidence tends 
to increase.” Furthermore, “[p]eople become more stoic as they age — they are 
more accepting of unpleasant experiences”, and they “are more appreciative of good 
experiences because they do not take them for granted”. When it comes to tolerance, 
the elderly are divided, with some becoming “more tolerant of views different from 
their own but others” becoming “more rigid about their beliefs” (Atef, 2010): 29).
For some elderly people, cognitive functioning is drastically reduced. This is 
especially the case for people with dementia, which is a neurocognitive disorder that 
involves impairments to memory, thinking and behavior. Such impairments can fur-
ther influence emotions, language use, motivation and well-being. A person with 
dementia experiences a more rapid cognitive decline than other people of the same 
age. The general trend internationally towards longer life expectancy, with elderly 
people accounting for a larger share of the total population, and those over 80 years 
old increasing the most in number, implies that there will likely be more people with 
dementia in the next few generations than there are today. Though dementia varies 
considerably in severity from person to person, it always implies a weakening of the 
fully mature self-reflective agency that is typical for a normally functioning adult 
human being.
3.5.6  Marginal Cases
The story about how leading theorists thought about the universality of human 
agency within the human species is troubled and multifaceted. Within ethics, many 
scholars hold that only human beings with sophisticated cognitive capacities, or on 
the path towards developing such cognitive capacities, have full moral status 
(Tannenbaum & Jaworska, 2018). Several proponents of animal ethics acknowledge 
that animals, too, have moral status, and have made their argument by comparing 
the cognitive capacities of human “marginal cases” with animal cognitive capaci-
ties. Wilson (2001: 136) presents the argument as follows:
(1)	 If we are justified in attributing moral property P to such marginal cases 
as the senile, the severely mentally handicapped, infants, etc., then we 
are likewise justified in attributing moral property P to animals.
3.5  Development of Human Agency Through the Lifetime

76
(2)	 We are justified in attributing moral property P to the marginal cases.
(3)	 Therefore, we are justified in attributing moral property P to animals.
As Wilson (ibid.) notes, this way of arguing involves “an appeal for consistency 
in our moral thinking, demanding that the attributions of moral properties to entities 
be made in a rationally consistent manner.” Peter Singer (1975) promoted this line 
of argument in his fight for recognition of the moral considerability of animals. In 
animal ethics, the argument from marginal cases has been successful in demonstrat-
ing that several normally functioning animals (mostly mammals) have cognitive 
capacities that equal or surpasses the cognitive capacities of some marginal cases of 
humans. On the human end, however, this argumentation style has caused concerns 
for the value and treatment of vulnerable groups of human beings. O’Brien (2003) 
notes that the argument from marginal cases “has the potential to diminish our con-
sideration of people with severe cognitive disabilities” and “be yet another way our 
society justifies maltreatment of its most vulnerable members.” Though Singer 
(1979: 68) stressed that the aim of his argument “is to elevate the status of animals 
rather than to lower the status of any humans”, O’Brien (2003: 335) reminds us that 
“[e]quating humans who are labeled as intellectually disabled with animals has 
been a recurrent historical theme”, and cautions that treating cognitively disabled 
humans worse than other humans would diminish “living standards, the provision 
of basic rights and financial and other resources, and the life opportunities afforded 
group members” (ibid: 336).
Marginal cases usually refer to reduced cognitive capacities compared to a nor-
mally functioning adult human being. But in another sense, marginal cases could 
refer to any human traits that are considered abnormal because they only occur in a 
minority of humans. In these cases, it is important to acknowledge that several 
abnormal traits contribute to human diversity without constituting problems or defi-
ciencies. Some forms of statistical abnormalities are clearly beneficial. For exam-
ple, unusually high IQ is just as abnormal as unusually low IQ, but it hardly 
constitutes a problem in itself. Other examples concern people that are different in 
some respect without being better or worse than more normal human beings. For 
example, some people experience synesthesia, a perceptual phenomenon which 
means that stimulation of one sensory or cognitive pathway triggers an experience 
in another sensory or cognitive pathway. Since most people don’t “mix” senses in 
this way, this is abnormal – but it is usually not pathological, and many people who 
experience synesthesia report that it is pleasant and enriching.
In the context of gender, it has in our time become clear that gender identity does 
not always align with biological gender. Those who do not feel comfortable with the 
traditional binary gender system (male – female) and identify themselves as non-­
binary in one sense or another, are abnormal in statistical terms, but the fact that 
they are different from the majority does not indicate any problem or deficiency. In 
parallel with the ways in which homosexuality has in many countries gone from 
being considered sick or criminal to being accepted as normal, the status of being a 
transgender person now seems to be changing in some countries. In the US, for 
instance, “gender identity disorder” was in 2013 renamed “gender dysphoria” to 
lessen stigma (DSM-5, 2013).
3  Human Agency

77
In the context of mental health, abnormal traits or behaviors are generally only 
considered problematic, and an issue for psychiatry, if they interfere with normal 
functioning in everyday life. In short, some quirks are abnormal without being path-
ological. Neurodevelopmental disorders, such as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity 
Disorder (ADHD), affect people’s behavior and may for instance lead to more 
impulsive behaviour and risk taking. Autism is another neurodevelopmental disor-
der. Some autists have impairments in certain cognitive functions. Frith and Happé 
(1999) found that many autists are not able to perform as well as children with a 
normal neurocognitive development in experiments that test the child’s ability to 
distinguish between its own knowledge and other people’s knowledge. In their view, 
“self-consciousness requires the ability to reflect on mental states”, and an “inabil-
ity to pass standard ‘theory of mind’ tests, which refer to others’ false beliefs, may 
imply lack of self-consciousness. Individuals who persistently fail these tests may, 
in the extreme, be unable to reflect on their intentions or to anticipate their own 
actions” (ibid: 1).
Genetic disorders, which are caused by abnormalities in the human genome, are 
different from mental disorders but may also affect agential capacities and behav-
iors. One of the most common genetic disorders is Down’s syndrome, which results 
from having three rather than two copies of chromosome 21. People with Down’s 
syndrome usually have mild to moderate intellectual disability, with an IQ in the 
range of 35–70 (with an estimated average of 50) in early adulthood (Weijerman & 
de Winter, 2010), which is comparable to the IQ of normal 8- or 9-year-old children. 
Some people with Down’s syndrome work, but most of them are in a sheltered work 
environment. Due to various health issues, life expectancy even under optimal con-
ditions seldom exceeds 50–60 years.
3.6  Development of Human Agency in Historical Perspective
The historical development of human agency concerns those social features of 
Homo sapiens that have been absent or less developed in hominid ancestors and 
other animals, such as language, culture, economy, technology, and social organiza-
tion. The social integration of non-human animals has a long evolutionary history. 
In invertebrates, social relations are based mostly on physiology and instincts. Even 
in cognitive social insects such as bees and ants, social interaction seems to be regu-
lated exclusively by innate behaviors rather than by learned cognitive representa-
tions or emotions. Nevertheless, social insects were pioneers in developing joint 
collection and production of food and other resources, which somewhat resembles 
human farming (e.g., in leaf-cutting ants). Cognitively based sociality is known 
only in mammals (e.g., in rodents, ungulates, carnivores, whales, and primates) and 
birds (e.g., penguins). But in contrast to humans, most social mammals have not 
developed content-rich communication and joint production of food or tools (except 
for joint nest building and hunting in some species).
3.6  Development of Human Agency in Historical Perspective

78
Ever since Aristotle’s characterization of the human being as a zoon politicon, 
i.e., a political (or social) animal, it has been acknowledged that sociality is charac-
teristic for the human species. Specifically, the human form of sociality has some 
unique features, such as allo-parenting (Kenkel et al., 2016), content-rich language, 
and division of labor. Development of advanced human social features was facili-
tated by preceding evolutionary changes in morphology (bipedalism, large brain, 
voice-supporting larynx, and flexible hands) and cognitive capacity (imagination 
and creativity) which was mostly completed in the upper Paleolithic (ca. 40,000 
years ago). At this time humans already had language and culture, and populated 
most of Africa, Eurasia, and Australia. Features of human language and culture are 
described below (Sect. 3.7).
In the following brief overview of human history we emphasize the progressive 
change of social human agency in terms of productivity and diversity. It is not meant 
to be exhaustive in any respect. Most historical events and human cultural activities, 
such as literature and arts, are entirely ignored. Instead, we trace the coevolution of 
social relations, profile of human productivity, and the human niche over the past 12 
millennia.
Paleolithic humans were nomads and hunter-gatherers. They lived in natural ref-
uges, temporary shelters or tents in small groups such as an extended family or tribe. 
The more intensive cultural development of humans started with the Neolithic revo-
lution with the origin of farming around 10,000 BC in the “Fertile Crescent” of 
Mesopotamia (Fig. 3.3). Based on archaeological data, we know that several species

logical sites. (Image from Wikimedia Commons)

of plants and animals were domesticated at that time. In China, agriculture is traced 
back to 8000 BC (Wu et al., 2019). Farming required a transition from a nomadic 
lifestyle to permanent settlings which gradually expanded. Farming communities 
modified their natural habitats by irrigation, deforestation and soil management. 
Agriculture required tools, and this factor stimulated the development of various 
technologies, including pottery, polishing of stone axes, adzes, and chisels, carving 
and polishing of wooden artifacts (Roberts & Westad, 2013: 24–38).
Neolithic populations accumulated food and tools, and practiced the division of 
labor. The standard of living of farming populations increased after the 4th and 3rd 
millennia BC due to a “secondary products revolution”, when people started using 
animals not only for meat but also for other products, such as milk, skins, wool, and 
manure (ibid: 34). Animals were further used as workforce for traction. At about the 
same time, people started using metals for making tools and decorations.
The period from 3300 to 1200 BC is known as the Bronze Age because of the 
increasing use of bronze artifacts. One of the most advanced cultures was Sumerian 
civilization (ca. 3300–2000 BC) characterized by larger settlements complex social 
structure (Roberts & Westad, 2013: 53–67). This civilization practiced writing on 
clay tablets and goods exchange. Exchanges were recorded on clay tablets, and later 
money was used in the form of measures of grain or silver to simplify trade (ibid: 
91). The excess of food and other goods led to the emergence of a ruling social elite 
represented by a king and government (ibid: 57–58). Metal jewelry was possibly 
used as an index of social status. Monopolization of power was accompanied by 
growth in social inequality, use of slavery and organized warfare. Production of 
metals implies the development of mining and smelting technologies. The system of 
knowledge included mathematics (algebra and geometry), and astronomy (ibid: 65).
Sumerians practiced law, which is an instituted system of social norms. According 
to Bicchieri et al. (2018), “norms refer to actions over which people have control, 
and are supported by shared expectations about what should or should not be done 
in different types of social situations” (see also Sect. 3.8). Sumerian law offered 
women certain rights in the case of a divorce, although men had more privileges 
than women.
The Bronze Age was followed by the Iron Age (1200-323 BC), which is known 
for increased production of tools and weapons from iron and steel. In Ancient Egypt, 
the initial source of iron was meteorites (Johnson et al., 2013). Iron smelting appar-
ently appeared ca. 1500 BC, as follows from findings of a large number of smelted 
iron objects in archeological sites of Mesopotamia, Anatolia and Egypt (Photos, 
1989). Iron ore is much more abundant than copper (the main component of bronze), 
which makes iron economically justified. The use of iron tools and parts was espe-
cially important in agriculture, construction, transportation, and military technology.
As governments increased their power and military strength, small states and 
nations tended to merge into larger ones. The Iron Age ended with the military cam-
paign of Alexander the Great who conquered Greece, the Balkans, the Middle East, 
Egypt, Assyria, Babylonia, Syria, the Persian Empire, parts of India, and other 
countries (Roberts & Westad, 2013: 201–207). Although the empire collapsed soon 
after Alexander’s death, it had a profound effect on the integration of diverse

cultures. Its history can be seen as the start of a dialogue and trade between East 
and West.
Subsequent Hellenistic and Roman periods are characterized by widespread 
slavery. The upper-class experienced luxury life, whereas slaves were deemed to 
hard work and usually an early death. As a result, most social developments, such as 
progress in the arts, science, philosophy, democracy, and justice were restricted to a 
small, privileged part of the population.
One of the great achievements of the Roman Empire, was development of the 
judiciary system. The civil law (jus civile) was practiced there mostly after Twelve 
Tables were enacted in 450 BC. They describe the procedure for courts, judges, and 
trials, execution of judgment, rights of citizen, definition of crimes, financial trans-
actions, and other law-related issues (Herbermann, 1913).4 These rules supported 
the stability and growth of Roman economy. However, initially there was no mecha-
nism for expanding the law via judicial legislation. Later, the Roman magistrate, 
acquired such rights and started developing additional laws and expanding the con-
tent of existing laws (ibid.).
A major revision of Roman law was initiated by the Byzantine emperor Justinian 
I, and its result was a compendium called Codex Constitutionum which were enacted 
by 529 AC (Jolowicz, 2020). This volume had several additions which together 
comprise the Corpus Juris of Justinian. It includes “the law of persons”, which 
defines rights of citizen, slaves, members of family, and corporations; “the law of 
property and possession”, which specifies ownership and property transfer; “delict 
and contract”, which deals with theft, injury, property damage, or debts; “the law of 
succession”, which describes property transfer after death of an owner; and “the law 
of procedure”, which specifies court procedures (ibid.). Corpus Juris of Justinian 
has been since used in many countries as a core portion of their law systems.
The period of the Middle Ages, which in Europe was characterized by feudalism 
in economic relations, lasted from the fifth to fifteenth century. The major value in 
feudalism was land ownership that was granted by kings and tsars (Roberts & 
Westad, 2013: 427–429). As a result, the economic and political powers were 
strongly centralized within each country. An additional centralizing and stabilizing 
factor of international scale was the Catholic Church, which regulated regional poli-
cies and often supported peaceful resolution of conflicts between countries. It sup-
ported the power of monarchies and organized resistance against Muslim invasion 
in France, Spain, Italy, Northern Africa, and the Balkans.
Peasants who worked on the land mostly had the status of serfs, which was gen-
erally freer than the status of slaves. Serfs had a right to work and live on a piece of 
land in exchange for working for their lord and paying taxes and fees. Serfs were 
often bought and sold together with land. They were generally allowed to make 
management decisions on their land and accumulate some property and goods. This 
partial freedom increased agricultural production as compared to slavery. However,

81
even these minimal freedoms of serfs were often denied by kings or lower-level 
landlords.
The periods of the Renaissance and Enlightenment (fourteenth to eighteenth cen-
turies) were characterized by the reduction of power of the Catholic Church and the 
emergence of Protestantism. In economy, it was a transition period from feudalism 
to modern capitalism, which initially progressed mostly in protestant countries of 
North-Western Europe, such as the Dutch Republic (Israel, 1995). Another factor 
that stimulated the economy was colonialism. Europe’s conquering of other coun-
tries and territories for economic exploitation started with actions by Spain and 
Portugal in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Later, colonies were captured by 
England, the Dutch Republic, France, and Germany. As a result, by the ninteenth 
century most of the whole world, including much of the Americas, Africa, Australia, 
India, and Eastern Asia became divided between a few powerful metropoles (von 
Albertini & Wirz, 1982). Indigenous people in colonies were used mostly as slaves 
or cheap labor.
Capitalist economic relations gradually became dominant in Europe and North 
America after the Industrial Revolution of the ninteenth century. Major changes 
included mass production of industrial goods with the help of machines powered 
mostly by water, coal, and steam. Industrialization increased economic productivity, 
but the standard of living of workers remained low, due to growing inequality and 
longer workdays than before. Child labor was common in textile manufacturing, 
whereas the industry in colonies was based almost totally on slavery.
Development of technology resulted in the gradual development of techno-­
human agency, where humans are strongly integrated with technical devices to the 
extent where technology modifies human behavior, psychology, and social rela-
tions. Such kind of agency “resides in the blind spot in which society and matter 
exchange properties” (Latour, 1999: 177). Driving a car is more than just transporta-
tion; it is a new skill and mentality, involving a feeling of freedom and seeing new 
possibilities. A driver plays the role of an executive subagent within a car (techno-­
human agent), whereas the car provides the power, comfort, and supplemental sens-
ing via gauges, and enhances the driver’s vision by headlights and windshield 
wipers. Another example of techno-human agency is a person with a weapon:
Neither the isolated gun nor the isolated individual can bear the responsibility for the act of 
killing. The responsibility lies, on the one hand, in the way those two agents come together 
to construct a new hybrid agent – the gunman – and on the other, in the socio-technical 
network that supports and makes possible such a meeting. (Knappett & Malafouris, 2010: 
xi–xii)
The twentieth century brought dramatic changes to the human world. Electricity 
and processed oil (a fuel for combustion engines) became dominant as energy 
sources. The colonial empires collapsed one after another ending most slavery 
worldwide. Fascism in Europe was defeated in the II World War. Revolutions and 
the downfall of authoritarian regimes resulted in the establishment of democratic 
governments in many countries in Europe, Asia, Africa, and America.
3.6  Development of Human Agency in Historical Perspective

82
Among new industries that emerged in the twentiethentury, especially important 
are information and communications technologies, which are still in progress now 
(Silva & Di Serio, 2016: 128). Computer technology has permeated most industries, 
making devices autonomous, self-regulating, and communicating. A flood of related 
innovations has changed market conditions for companies, leading to an increase in 
the standard of living and virtual connectedness of people via Internet and cell 
phones. These developments have empowered a new generation of techno-human 
agency: social media, virtual reality, and even brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). For 
example, non-invasive BCI (EEG-based) allow humans to manipulate a computer 
(Farwell & Donchin, 1988).
Though the average income has increased over time in practically all countries 
over the last century (Maddison, 2003), there is still a considerable inequality in 
both income and wealth within and among countries (World Inequality Database, 
2018). Most countries have in the long run followed a similar transition from an 
agricultural economy to industrial growth, and eventually towards an economy in 
which the service sector dominates. Such transitions have changed power relations, 
business organizations, labor markets, and livelihoods in several rounds.
The demographics of human populations have also changed. Over the last 250 
years, global life expectancy has increased from less than 30 years to more than 70 
years (Our World in Data, 2020). Infant mortality has decreased from ca. 20% to 
below 3%, and less than 5% of humans die before they are 15 years old (Roser, 
2019). The majority of countries in the world experienced a “demographic transi-
tion” from high mortality and high birth rates to low mortality and low birth rates, 
and the remaining countries are expected to pass such a transition in this century 
(Lee, 2003). Finally, there has been a revolution in education: the literacy rate 
among adults globally has increased from about 12% in year 1800 to about 86% 
today. Since 1950 or so, a majority of the world population has been literate (Out 
World in Data 2020). The increase in literacy has given a vast majority of the current 
world population opportunities in life that many previous generations of human 
beings did not have (cf. Sect. 3.7, “Human Culture and Language”). These changes 
have increased the agential opportunities of people in all countries, and have the 
potential to contribute to reducing economic and cultural inequality between regions 
and within local communities.
In the twenty-first century, humankind faces additional challenges related to 
population growth and deterioration of the global environment. Today human beings 
account for 36% of the biomass of all mammals, while livestock accounts for a 
further 60%. This means that 96% of mammal biomass is today anthropogenic; 
whereas wild mammals represent only 4% (Bar-On et al., 2018). More than half of 
the Earth’s land mass is now utilized for human purposes, and globally wildlife is 
marginalized (IPBES, 2019). Resource utilization, including of oil and coal, has 
kept increasing over time. Zalasiewicz et al. (2016) estimate that the current mass of 
anthropogenic CO2 in the atmosphere is nearly 1 trillion tones. Key business discus-
sions now “revolves around the need for companies to incorporate sustainability as 
a competitive factor, linking it to organizational objectives […] in order to generate 
economic, social and environmental benefits that lead to the creation of competitive

83
advantage and potential innovation” (Silva & Di Serio, 2016: 128–129). In effect, 
today there are signs of a new emerging wave of innovation related to ecological 
sustainability.
3.7  Human Culture and Language
Culture is most often defined as “something that is widely shared by members of a 
social group and shared in virtue of belonging to that group” (Prinz, 2020), and may 
include e.g. beliefs, art, moral values, customs and habits. This implies that “culture 
is socially transmitted” (ibid.) and indicates that culture is important for the group 
identity of human beings. Cultural transmission, i.e. transmission of cultural traits 
among a group of persons, happens by way of learning and imitation. In this per-
spective, cultural change may happen on a micro scale, in an exchange of habits 
from person to person, though it only becomes noticeable on larger scales involving 
whole cultures or subcultures.
Many would say that cultural expressions such as art, literature and music are 
among humankind’s finest achievements. What they have in common is that they 
relate to human beings’ aesthetic and existential sensibility and abilities to express 
emotions, impressions and ideas, either with use of language, or by other means (or 
by a combination of linguistic and non-linguistic means). Opinions differ on to what 
extent human beings, with their culture and language, are unique in comparison 
with other species.
Kull, Kotov and Keskpaik (Kull et al., 2004: 26) described the relation between 
culture and nature in a programmatic ecosemiotic statement: “Culture is a subsys-
tem of biosphere and like any other subsystem of biosphere, it is functionally related 
to the total web of semiotic interrelations in biosphere”. “The relationship of humans 
with their environment” is “culturally mediated and culturally conceptualised” 
(ibid.), and thus varies from culture to culture. This is a typical biosemiotic under-
standing of culture, and is also supported by Ipsen (2006: 83), who observes that 
“the human agency in conceptualising the Umwelt necessarily transforms what we 
usually call ‘nature’ into so-called ‘culture’”. This implies that, for human beings, 
“any environmental perception is at once conceived of in cultural terms” (ibid.).
There is no consensus in the degree of difference between human language and 
animal communication. John Deely (2015) considered advanced forms of commu-
nication and understanding that require self-reflectivity as genuinely human and not 
attainable for any other organism. Deely expressed this by distinguishing between 
humans as “semiotic animals”, and non-human animals as “semiosic animals”. The 
implication is that non-human animals make use of signs, just as human beings do, 
but only human beings comprehend what signs are. While Deely’s conception of 
semiosis is inclusive of biosemiosis, his sharp human/non-human distinction resem-
bles other such dichotomies in classical and contemporary philosophy, albeit with a 
semiotic framing.
3.7  Human Culture and Language

84
Hoffmeyer and Stjernfelt (2016), in contrast, adopt a distinctly gradualist posi-
tion, referring to a number of steps in “the evolution of semiotic competence” (ibid: 
7), with humans holding one of the latest and in many cases the most sophisticated 
form of semiotic competence. They share Deely’s understanding concerning the 
extent of biosemiosis, but draw a less sharp distinction between human and non-­
human semiosis. In their view, the evolution of semiosis has to date reached “its 
provisional peak in the rich combination possibilities of human thought and lan-
guage” (ibid: 28), with compositionality enhancing the semiotic freedom of human 
beings. In this perspective, all organisms have a degree of semiotic freedom (i.e., the 
depth of meaning someone is able to understand and relate to, cf. (Hoffmeyer, 
1996), but the human species has more semiotic freedom than any other species.
With reference to Peircean semiotics, Sonesson (2006: 198) stresses that human 
beings are unique in being able to “reach for the dynamical objects beyond the 
immediate ones.” In contrast, “The lion does not try to go beyond his own Umwelt 
to grasp the properties of the objects that lie behind it. There is, so to speak, no 
dynamical object beyond the immediate one to him” (ibid: 198–199). In Sonesson’s 
view, only human beings are capable of going beyond their current Umwelten by 
investigating objects further, whereas any nonhuman organism is mostly confined to 
its Umwelt.5
As Abram (1996) details, the ways people use language has changed drastically 
when human societies transitioned from oral (vocal) communication to written (dig-
ital) communication.6 In light of the new normal, oral cultures are now considered 
as “analphabetic”, i.e. characterized by their lack of alphabetic culture, or “illiter-
ate”, two of the most negatively loaded terms in the modern vocabulary.
Humans language is often supplemented with non-linguistic communicative sig-
naling that can add or modify meanings. As Deacon (1997: 53, cited in Sonesson 
2006: 147) points out, “we make extensive use of prosody [intonation, tone etc.], 
pointing, gesturing, and interactions with objects and other people to disambiguate 
our spoken messages”.
The capacity for language is no doubt characteristic for human beings, but we 
should not think of language as something that comes ready-made. Rather, it should 
be understood as a plastic, moldable capacity that is transformed and shaped as it is 
used, by the experience-based development of its implicit normativity and rational-
ity. According to Webber (2018), Merleau-Ponty (1962 [1945]) introduced the 
notion of “sedimentation” to describe
the process of taking on information about our bodies and environment in a form that 
enables us to act intelligently without much attention, effort or thought. Just as a river accu-
mulates particles and deposits them as sedimented structures that direct the river’s flow, 
argued Merleau-Ponty, so we accumulate information as we go about our lives, which 
5 Sonesson expresses this view by claiming that beyond having an Umwelt, human beings, unlike 
any animal, are also endowed with a Lebenswelt.
6 This transition has usually been slow, since it has typically taken a long time until written lan-
guage appeared widely used; this usually happened when the whole population was literate. In the 
transition time, only segments of the society were literate.

85
gradually and unconsciously builds into a contoured bedrock of understanding that guides 
our behaviour.
Such sedimentation also occurs when a human being learns a language and then 
develops habits of using it in specific ways over time. As Zlatev (2018: 15) notes,
the norms of language specifying what is “correct language,” are by no means pre-given, 
but instead emerge as sedimented structures through countless acts of both individual and 
social meaning making throughout a single life and, especially on the higher levels, across 
generations and history.
These sedimented structures that have accumulated during language use are 
“normative structures” which “provide for coherence and stability in individual and 
social meaning making” (ibid: 15). Zlatev observes (ibid: 15) that “it is only with 
the ‘acquisition’ of the sedimented structures of language that the person can truly 
become an agent of truth, capable of rising beyond the everyday ‘natural attitude’ 
into a questioning, philosophical attitude”. At this point, language use has settled 
into established patterns, and the well-rehearsed normativity (i.e. norms, values) 
and rationality (i.e., logics) of the language as it is being used allows the language 
user to relate systematically and coherently to issues of truth and falsehood.
Culture develops heterochronically in various geographic regions. As a result, 
advanced industrial societies coexist with some Stone Age-level isolated tribes 
(Kirsch, 1997) (mostly in tropical rainforest). The increased interaction between 
geographically separated regions in the last century resulted in accelerated cultural 
development of many African and Asian nations. These young nations that struggle 
to bridge the cultural gap should not be discriminated in their relations with more 
developed nations. An important step in this direction was the adoption of the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights by the General Assembly of UN in 1948.
3.8  Social Regulation: Ethics, Economy, and Law
As already mentioned, the human species is not the only species to form cooperative 
societies, but human societies and social regulation clearly have several unique 
traits. For instance, we are not the only species to fight among ourselves with vio-
lence and display of aggression, but we might be the only species to fight wars 
(though some researchers think that e.g. chimpanzees do it too). We are not the only 
species to act normatively, but we institutionalize our normativity in ways that no 
other species does. We are not the only species to have needs and to utilize resources, 
but our resource utilization (and thus economy) is much more advanced and exten-
sive than that of any other species. All this concerns social regulation.
Champagne (2011) suggests that all Umwelten are normative by design, in the 
sense that any organism with an Umwelt routinely distinguishes between what is 
desirable for it and what is not. In the bigger picture, ethical normativity and the 
human capacity for making moral judgments is a special case of normativity in a 
more general sense. What is specific in human beings is not that they act or reason 
3.8  Social Regulation: Ethics, Economy, and Law

86
normatively (many animals do), but that they are capable of acting and reasoning 
normatively in the context of moral responsibility with a high degree of self-­
reflectivity. Opinions differ on whether or not the human being is the only species 
that is capable of making moral judgments. For example, Bekoff and Pierce (2009) 
argue that many animals have a sense of fairness. Regardless of that, there is no 
doubt about the fact that human beings are capable of relating to moral issues in a 
more self-reflective way than any other organism on Earth. As we have seen in pre-
vious sections, the moral judgment of human beings develops in stages during 
childhood and also in early adulthood (Kohlberg, 1968), and may differ between 
genders (Gilligan, 1982), among other factors.
One of the fundamental virtues in ethics is social equality. Historically, people 
have tended to think about their own form of civilization as so unique that they 
believed in their own superiority over other humans and have had only limited con-
fidence in the agential capacities of people from outside their culture. Even the 
much-admired Ancient Greeks distinguished sharply between themselves and oth-
ers, often referring to non-Greeks as “savages”. It has also been common to think 
that segments of any population are incapable of achieving much in life.
Only quite recently has the belief that all human beings have the same potential 
for developing agential capacities become commonplace. Without proper training 
or mentoring, however, such potential will be wasted. At the time when John Stuart 
Mill (1806–1873) lived, school attendance for girls was much lower than for boys, 
and it was commonplace to think that girls did not have the same intellectual poten-
tial as boys. This was seen as a reason not to send them to school. But Mill realized 
that what the girls missed was not intellectual potential, but equal access to educa-
tion on par with boys, which would make this potential come to fruition. In our own 
time – as symbolized by the UN declaration of human rights – we believe that all 
human beings have the same potential for developing advanced agential capacities, 
and that human development and social progress hinges on offering people equal 
opportunities in life.
This modern understanding of human agency implies assuming that the vast 
majority of human individuals (though not literally all) are capable of developing 
similar agentive capabilities, if only they are given equal opportunities in life.7 For 
this human potential to be realised, girls and boys, women and men, and individuals 
with disabilities must be offered education on an equal basis.
The human capacity for caring about more general entities such as “the environ-
ment” or “other species” may be related to advanced virtues. According to Deely 
(2015: 89), the aforementioned notion of “the semiotic animal shows what sets the 
human animal apart and ‘above’, in a certain sense, but a sense which is so tied in 
with the rest of nature as to have the curious consequence of giving humans ethical 
responsibility for the whole planet”. In Deely’s view, this uniquely human sense of 
7 Exceptions typically involve people with neurocognitive impairments or disorders. Also, while 
equal opportunities in life are emphasized, it is also generally acknowledged that IQ and talents are 
unevenly distributed, even though a majority of people fall within a category of approximate 
normality.
3  Human Agency

87
responsibility for the whole planet practically constitutes semioethics, a label devel-
oped by Susan Petrilli and Augusto Ponzio (2005) in particular which points to the 
semiotic basis of ethics. Deely adopted the key features of this understanding and 
argued (Deely, 2005: 230) that “what is essential to the distinctiveness of human 
understanding”, namely human beings capacity for knowing that there are signs, is 
a prerequisite for “so much as the possibility of semioethics (or ethics of any vari-
ety).” If it wasn’t for our semiotic capabilities, in this view, we wouldn’t be endowed 
with morality either. Beever and Tønnessen (2017) take this idea one step further by 
arguing that our awareness of the occurrence of biosemiosis in the living world may 
serve as a starting point for attribution of moral status (i.e., moral considerability), 
on the assumption that the semiotic agency of organisms is a morally relevant 
property.
Like ethics, law, too, is normative by nature. While adherence to rules or princi-
ples is one among a variety of traditions in ethics,8 in law, adherence to rules and 
principles predominates. The advantage of a rule is that it is more likely to be 
applied uniformly to all people irrespectively of their social status, which ensures 
equal rights and responsibilities as specified by law. The primacy of rules leads to a 
natural focus on interpretation of rules in and by themselves, their interconnection, 
exceptions, range of validity, etc. A connection between law and ethics is consti-
tuted by the population’s sense of justice and fairness, which lawmakers and repre-
sentatives of the judiciary typically appeal to. These are ethical values that comprise 
some of the basis for people’s moral judgment, and for their political judgment as 
citizens.
In various ways, laws are enforced by the authorities with the sanctions they 
choose to apply to those who break the laws. In the context of law enforcement in 
general, we can observe that the enforcement of laws rests not only on popular sup-
port, but also on the inhabitants’ general inclinations towards obedience. In cases 
where the duty of obedience to authorities comes into conflict with a person’s moral 
conviction, there are normative dilemmas in which the law and morality clash.
Angus Maddison (2003) surveyed long-term historical real GDP levels across 
the world in terms of purchasing power parity, which measures the standard cost of 
living in various countries. His work shows that a majority of humans in earlier 
historical times lived near the absolute poverty line, with only modest improve-
ments in living standards achieved in some regions. Since 1800 or so, however, an 
increasing number of countries have experienced a more sustained economic growth 
per capita, and by today, most countries have achieved much higher levels of pro-
duction and consumption. In the contemporary environmental discourse, it is widely 
acknowledged that excessive resource exploitation has resulted in a range of envi-
ronmental problems, and a key issue is now whether the unrestricted “grey growth” 
of the past should be replaced by “green growth” that does not cause further 
8 Rule-based deontological ethics is usually opposed to virtue ethics that emphasizes consequences, 
and ethics of care, which is focused on the response to human needs.
3.8  Social Regulation: Ethics, Economy, and Law

88
environmental degradation or even “degrowth”, which implies a downscaling of 
production and consumption (Sandberg et al., 2019).
The economist Richard Easterlin (1974) is known for having questioned the 
common assumption that economic growth improves the quality of human life. The 
so-called “Easterlin paradox”, named after him, states that people do not necessarily 
become happier as their income increases, despite the fact that at each point in time 
happiness correlates with income within and across countries. In this view, income 
does matter for how happy people become, but only when they compare themselves 
to other people living at the same time and place. “If the view suggested here has 
merit,” he writes (ibid: 121), “economic growth does not raise a society to some 
ultimate state of plenty. Rather, the growth process itself engenders ever-growing 
wants that lead it ever onward.” In other words, affluence simultaneously affects 
human expectations as well as human satisfaction, and this has the effect that people 
do not necessarily experience increased satisfaction overall when some needs are 
met, or some wants are satisfied. Instead, the satisfaction of some wants triggers the 
expectation that further wants may soon be satisfied. What Easterlin suggests, is 
basically that the human being is a constantly wanting organism, whose wants can 
multiply but never be fully satisfied.
The psychologist Abraham Maslow (1943) makes similar claims, stating that the 
human being “is a perpetually wanting animal” (ibid: 370, cf. 395).9 In the context 
of industrialized, affluent societies, he writes (ibid: 395) that the “average member 
of our society is most often partially satisfied and partially unsatisfied in all of his 
wants.” Maslow is known for his conception of a hierarchy of needs, which is often 
illustrated in the form of a pyramid (Fig. 3.4).
In the initial version of Maslow’s hierarchy of human needs, five “sets of goals” 
or “basic needs” were characterized as physiological, safety, love, esteem, and self-­
actualization (ibid: 394). In Maslow’s outlook, the more fundamental needs of a 
human being (at the bottom of the pyramid) must be fulfilled before higher-order 
needs are given priority. Physiological needs are the most fundamental, with the 
need for love and friendship at the middle of the pyramid, and esteem and self-­
actualization among the higher-level needs. Generally, “the appearance of one need 
usually rests on the prior satisfaction of another, more pre-potent need” (ibid: 370). 
The primacy of physiological needs implies that
in the human being who is missing everything in life in an extreme fashion, it is most likely 
that the major motivation would be the physiological needs rather than any others. A person 
who is lacking food, safety, love, and esteem would most probably hunger for food more 
strongly than for anything else. (ibid: 373)
9 Maslow stresses that human beings should not be judged by animal standards (Maslow, 1943: 
392), as behaviorism favored. For a period, the notions of purpose and goal were excluded from 
motivational psychology, though Maslow notes (ibid.) that Tolman (1932) proved that this exclu-
sion was not necessary in animal studies. “Too many of the findings that have been made in ani-
mals”, he remarks, “have been proven to be true for animals but not for the human being” (Maslow, 
1943: 392). Rats, in Maslow’s view (ibid: 374), “have few motivations other than physiological 
ones, and since so much of the research upon motivation has been made with these animals, it is 
easy to carry the rat-picture over to the human being” – but this, he stresses, would be misleading.

In the context of economics, a lack of satisfaction of physiological needs may be 
taken to indicate absolute or extreme poverty. Operating with a somewhat narrower 
definition of basic needs than Maslow, Eskelinen (2011) defines absolute poverty as 
“the state in which a subject lacks the means to meet his or her basic needs.” Basic 
needs are in this context said to “include food, water, shelter, basic education, and 
basic medical care.”10 In contrast, extreme poverty is “defined as a state in which a 
person lacks access to all, or several, of the goods needed for meeting these basic 
needs” (ibid. 2011). Maslow observed that “culture itself is an adaptive tool, one of 
whose main functions is to make the physiological emergencies come less and less 
often” (ibid: 374). This facilitates the possible satisfaction of higher needs. For 
example, in circumstances of severe deprivation of fundamental needs, an individ-
ual would be deprived from core elements of a typical human life with its inherent 
possibilities and this would affect social relations with other humans.
10 Maslow (1943) explicitly mentions the need for food, water, and shelter under physiological 
needs. Education is only mentioned in passing, and the closest thing to “medical care” is “medical 
[insurance]”, which is mentioned in the context of safety needs. The contemporary reader should 
note that basic education and medical care has become available for a vast majority of the world 
population in the time since Maslow wrote his influential essay in 1943 but was not as widely 
available internationally in his time.

While Maslow distinguished between more or less fundamental needs, and 
Easterlin questioned whether income level brings happiness, John Maynard Keynes 
(1978 [1936]) developed a theory of macroeconomics that explained the dynamics 
of demand, investment, and employment during recession cycles. He suggested 
mitigating the destructive economic effects of recessions by increased governmen-
tal spending and lower taxes, a policy that became widely accepted later. In the 
years of the Great Depression of the 1930s, Keynes remained optimistic and wrote 
that for human beings, “the economic problem may be solved, or be at least within 
sight of solution, within a hundred years. This means that the economic problem is 
not – if we look into the future – the permanent problem of the human race” (Keynes, 
1963 [1930]). Keynes predicted that for the first time in history, humankind would 
be faced with its real, “permanent problem – how to use his freedom from pressing 
economic cares, how to occupy the leisure, which science and compound interest 
will have won for him, to live wisely and agreeably and well” (ibid.).
Not so much work has been done that connects biosemiotic thinking with eco-
nomics. Von Uexküll (1910: 126) mentions in passing the Umwelten of professions 
(“Berufsumwelten”), and indicates that workers in the same profession share cer-
tain perceptions and similarly connect a number of Umwelt objects with their 
related functions as typical for the profession. In this perspective, being trained or 
educated for a certain profession entails learning to understand and interact with 
profession-specific Umwelt objects. In more recent work, Farina (2012) suggests 
that a general theory of resources could connect economics with ecology and biol-
ogy, with resources serving as the common denominator. In a similar manner, 
Tønnessen (2020) proposes that a non-anthropocentric framework for economics 
can be developed by investigating what role resources and goods play for both 
human and non-human stakeholders based on what each species values.

Agency in Non-human Organisms
Abstract  Semiotic agency is not restricted to humans; it is a natural phenomenon 
that is found in all living organisms. However, there are many levels of semiotic 
competence, and these are typically separated by qualitative evolutionary transi-
tions, such as the origin of the eukaryotic cell, multicellular eukaryotes, the nervous 
system, learning, thinking, and sociality. So far, agency in non-human organisms 
has not been studied comprehensively in any systematic manner. Developing exper-
imental techniques for studying different behaviors should be combined with taking 
a broader view on the role of each kind of behavior in the agential regulatory net-
work of functions. It is also important to abandon the monopoly of anthropocentric 
perspectives in evaluating progress in evolution, which implies regarding the human 
species as the endpoint of evolution. The evolution of semiotic agency will con-
tinue, and we should acknowledge that the human form of semiotic agency is just 
one among many forms that semiotic agency can take.
4.1  Gradation of Competence in Semiotic Agency
In this chapter we describe the agential properties of non-human organisms at vari-
ous levels of semiotic competence. The idea about a gradation or levels of perfec-
tion in living things has its roots in the ancient metaphysical concept of the Great 
Chain of Being (Lovejoy, 1948 [1936]). This chain or ladder has the most perfect 
creatures (angels and men) at the top and descends via mammals to reptiles, fish, 
worms, and finally plants. Lamarck was the first to interpret the Great Chain of 
Being as a historical sequence of evolving species that started from the most primi-
tive organisms and ascended towards mammals and ultimately men (Bateson, 1987 
[1972]: 456). In biology, the degree of organism perfection has traditionally been 
evaluated based on morphology and physiology: diversity of organs, their internal 
complexity, interconnection, and function. In contrast, Jesper Hoffmeyer and 
Frederik Stjernfelt have suggested using semiotic features as criteria for organiza-
tion levels. They wrote: “we propose the great chain of semiosis with particular 
emphasis on how the cognitive and communicative potentials of species may be 

96
classified according to their plasticity and articulatory sophistication” (Hoffmeyer 
& Stjernfelt, 2016: 8). In this book we follow this idea but extend it to the analysis 
of agency, since all embodied agents are carriers of semiosis. Thus, we combine 
biological and semiotic criteria in evaluating the level of competence of organisms 
within the great chain of semiotic agency.
The agential features of animals have often been denied or ignored in human 
history. Hunting and farming practices are traditionally built on the premise that 
animals lack feelings, emotions, and cognition in any way that is directly compa-
rable to human capacities. It is in this context not surprising that Descartes proposed 
a doctrine of dualism, according to which only humans carry agential powers such 
as autonomy and cognition, whereas animals and other living things are just soul-
less mechanisms. Because the denial of agency in animals can be easily extended 
towards people of different ethnicity or other religions, the worldview of dualism 
can quickly lead to hostile chauvinistic behaviors. The importance of recognizing 
agency in non-human animals and plants became clear only in the twentieth cen-
tury, when humans realized the detrimental effect of human activities on wild spe-
cies. We have only one planet Earth and each living species is irreplaceable. 
Attempts to slow down the rates of species extinction require changes of environ-
mental laws and policies, and most importantly – a change of attitudes towards wild 
species.
According to biosemiotics, all living organisms are semiotic agents capable of 
sensing and information-driven adaptive behavior. Thus, even the smallest creatures 
such as bacteria, the most abundant organisms on Earth, are agents. People were not 
even aware of their existence before the invention of a microscope by Anton van 
Leeuwenhoek in 1666. But even after the invention of a microscope, it took a long 
time to discover microbial agents that cause such infectious diseases as plague, 
cholera, syphilis, and tuberculosis. Pathogenic microbes are dangerous exactly 
because of their agential nature, which involves autonomy, self-reproduction, and a 
capacity to evolve and adapt. Many pathogenic bacteria have developed resistance 
to antibiotics, and viruses have acquired tools that help them evade the action of the 
immune system. It was Louis Pasteur who in 1860–1864 showed that pathogenic 
microorganisms indeed exist and that they reproduce in favorable environments. He 
also proposed practices for preventing contacts of humans with pathogenic micro-
organisms, an idea that inspired Joseph Lister to develop antiseptic methods.
The discoveries of Pasteur and Koch point to a very important feature of micro-
bial agents: they never appear out of nowhere. Instead, they are always produced by 
parental organisms of the same kind, and in this respect, they are similar to larger 
organisms such as animals and plants. All living organisms are interconnected into 
lineages that can be traced back to their ancestors. Analysis of the genomic DNA of 
various organisms has showed that all of them are distant relatives of a Last Universal 
Common Ancestor (LUCA) which could possibly be a heterogeneous community 
of organisms (Glansdorff et al., 2008), that lived on the young Earth about 3.5 bil-
lion years ago (Noffke et al., 2013). This discovery supports the notion that larger 
and more complex organisms, such as animals and plants, originated from single-­
cell microorganisms.

The topic of progressive evolution of organisms has attracted many biologists 
and philosophers, among them Spencer, Haeckel, Bergson, Teilhard de Chardin, 
and Vernadsky. Here we present a short overview of three theoretical studies that 
seem most relevant to the idea of semiotic agency, the books The phenomenon of 
science by Valentin Turchin and The major transitions in evolution by Maynard 
Smith and Szathmáry, and a paper by Hoffmeyer and Stjernfelt on the great chain of 
semiosis.
Turchin (1977) proposed to use the hierarchy of controls in organisms as a crite-
rion for the behavioral and semiotic complexity of organisms. In particular, he intro-
duced the notion metasystem transition to denote the emergence of a higher-level 
system that takes control of a number of lower-level systems. He wrote:
The metasystem transition creates a higher level of organization, the metalevel in relation to 
the level of organization of the subsystems being integrated. From the functional point of 
view the metasystem transition is the case where the activity α, which is characteristic of the 
top control system at a lower stage, becomes controlled at the higher stage and there appears 
a qualitatively new, higher, type of activity β which controls the activity α (Turchin, 
1977: 56–57).
Turchin was familiar with semiotics, and in his book he discussed the role of 
syntax and semantics in formal and natural languages (ibid: 135). However, he 
applied semiotic terms only to human languages and the logic of science. In relation 
to non-human organisms and human artifacts, he used the term “control” which 
comes from a cybernetic tradition. Turchin considered control as a purposeful orga-
nization of system events in time (ibid: 5). The notion of control appears crucial in 
the theory of metasystem transition because each level of organization emerges via 
the establishment of a new type of activity that controls activities at lower-levels. An 
important consequence of a metasystem transition is specialization of lower-­
level units:
When the subsystems being integrated are joined into a metasystem, specialization occurs; 
the subsystems become adapted to a particular activity and lose their capability for other 
types of activity. Specialization is seen particularly clearly where whole organisms are inte-
grated (ibid: 58–59).
Turchin distinguished ‘structural’ metasystem transitions achieved mostly by 
multiplication of smaller units followed by their integration into a larger unit, such 
as the origin of multicellular organisms from free single cells or integration of ants 
into a colony, from the ‘functional’ ones associated with the establishment of a new 
level of control that did not exist in lower-level units. According to Turchin, five 
functional metasystem transitions happened before “the era of reason”: (1) the 
chemical foundations of life, (2) movement, (3) irritability, (4) nerve nets, and (5) 
associating (Fig. 4.1a). Each of them appeared as a system that controlled systems 
at the previous level: movement = control of position; irritability = control of move-
ment; nerve net = control of irritability, and associating = control of nerve nets. 
Irritability is considered as a transition from the “chemical era” to the “cyber-
netic era”.
4.1  Gradation of Competence in Semiotic Agency

98
Turchin noted that one of the challenges in any metasystem transition is the over-
whelming combinatorial complexity of possible connections, such as between a 
large number of receptors and effectors (ibid: 20). Evolving animal species resolved 
this problem by developing classifiers which work as information filters: “the chief 
task of the classifiers is to store ‘significant’ information and discard ‘insignificant’ 
information” (ibid: 62).
In the era of reason, Turchin delineated three metasystem transitions, of which 
the last one is only emerging: (1) thinking = control of associating, (2) culture = con-
trol of thinking, and (3) science and ethics = control of culture. Turchin thought that 
in comparison to humans, the social integration of animals (e.g., ants) is “unsuc-
cessful” because only the lower functions are integrated without establishing any 
“contact among brains” and developing new models of reality.1
Maynard Smith and Szathmáry (1995) wrote their book on major transitions in 
evolution about two decades after Turchin, and had the benefit of using enormous 
information accumulated by molecular biology and evolutionary science at that 
time. Another advantage was that both authors were top-level biologists, whereas 
1 Turchin underestimated the degree of functional integration of animal communities. Animals 
certainly establish brain contacts via imitation, parental care, play behaviors, and various means of 
communication (e.g., acoustic, pheromonal). However, animals do not develop a linguistically 
integrated culture.

Turchin was a cybernetician and computer specialist. Despite of that, there is a deep 
similarity between these two monographs. Like Tirchin, Maynard Smith and 
Szathmáry also viewed a cybernetic factor, i.e., the way information is stored and 
transmitted, as the driving force in major transitions. In addition, they listed two 
other factors: central control of reproduction and division of labor (similar to 
Turchin’s “specialization”).
The list of major transitions suggested by Maynard Smith and Szathmáry, 
(Fig. 4.1b) includes eight evolutionary events, of which five are “structural” meta-
system transitions2 based on Turchin’s criteria. In contrast to the Turchin’s theory 
which is focused on the organization of animal behaviors in general, Maynard Smith 
and Szathmáry emphasized reproduction as the major activity of organisms. 
Although both theories are based on Darwin’s concept of natural selection, Maynard 
Smith and Szathmáry followed the neo-Darwinistic ideas of Richard Dawkins 
(1976) on the primacy of genes in evolution. This explains the central role of repro-
duction and its control by higher-level agents in their theory. They also assumed that 
all major transitions are driven by the “immediate selective advantage of individual 
replicators” (i.e., genes) (Szathmáry & Maynard Smith, 1995: 227). This approach 
is based on two arguable premises which stipulate that (a) evolution in gene-centric, 
and (b) long-term evolutionary trends are reduced to the processes of 
microevolution.3
The theory of major transitions offers several new ideas on the paths towards 
emergence of higher-level agents. The first idea is that the central control of the 
higher-level system does not necessarily arise via establishment of a dominating 
(i.e., “totalitarian”) single subagent. Instead, central control can emerge by mutual 
regulation of interacting member subagents. Szathmáry and Maynard Smith offer 
the following example: ‘selfish’ activities of genes can be repressed by neighboring 
genes or genomic locuses (ibid: 228). And the second idea is that the increase of 
diversity of elements in organisms can result from multiple eco-evolutionary strate-
gies, such as (a) duplication of elements followed by their specialization in different 
functions, (b) symbiosis, and (c) epigenesis, which is the sharing of agential states 
(e.g., the chromatin status of genes) with other agents.
Hoffmeyer and Stjernfelt (2016) discussed eleven qualitative steps in evolution 
of semiosis (Fig. 4.1c), the first three of which match the scheme of Maynard Smith 
and Szathmáry. The other evolutionary steps are functional (i.e., not structural) and 
represent levels of semiotic competence, which are similar but not identical to the 
metasystem transitions of Turchin (1977): (4) from irritability to phenotypic plastic-
ity, (5) sense perception, (6) behavioral choice, (7) active information gathering, (8) 
collaboration, deception, (9) learning and social intelligence, (10) sentience, and 
(11) consciousness. The main difference is that Turchin described evolutionary 
transitions in cybernetic terms (i.e., as control), whereas Hoffmeyer and Stjernfelt 
used higher-level semiotic and agential concepts.

4.1  Gradation of Competence in Semiotic Agency

100
In a recently published book, The evolution of the sensitive soul, Simona Ginsburg 
and Eva Jablonka (2019: 243) expanded the list of major evolutionary transitions 
proposed earlier by Maynard Smith and Szathmáry (1995) by adding four behavior-­
related steps that mark the origin of: (1) limited associative learning (LAL), (2) 
unlimited associative learning (UAL), (3) imagination, and (4) symbolic representa-
tion and communication. Their theory is closer to Turchin’s approach because it is 
focused mostly on control and the association capacity of organisms. In particular, 
LAL step overlaps with association/conditioning, UAL with thinking, and symbolic 
representation with culture in Turchin’s scheme.
4.2  The Agency of Bacteria
What kind of agency can be found in bacteria? An extreme point of view was pre-
sented by James Shapiro (2011) in his book Evolution: A view from the twenty-first 
Century, where he described bacteria in terms that are normally applied to cognitive 
and sentient agents. In response to critical reviews of his book, Shapiro (2012: 211) 
wrote: “I described exactly what I meant by cognition (=action based on knowledge 
acquired through sensing)”.
Bacteria do demonstrate very complex processes of information processing and 
signaling, as described in detail by Shapiro (2011). Membrane receptors can detect 
various chemicals in the environment (sugars, amino acids, harmful molecules, and 
chemical signals from other bacteria) and transmit this information to regulate the 
expression of genes and the function of other cell components. This signaling can 
support the movement of bacteria towards areas with increased concentration of 
glucose (chemotaxis). The bacteria Escherichia coli has large arrays of receptors 
that respond to glucose binding by activating secondary messengers that pass the 
signal to bacterial flagella, which are organelles of locomotion protruding outwards 
from the membrane-bound base. The signal determines the direction of flagella 
rotation: the clock-wise rotation causes random cell tumbling, whereas counter-­
clock-­wise rotation causes flagella to form a bundle and propel the bacterial cell 
forward (Bickhard, 1998). As a result, a bacterium keeps moving in the same direc-
tion if the abundance of glucose increases; but if the concentration of glucose levels 
off, the bacterium starts tumbling around until it finds another gradient to follow.
The movement of bacteria towards higher glucose abundance can be understood 
as being of a cognitive nature. However, this explanation is problematic for two 
reasons. First, bacteria do not ‘know’ that glucose exists outside. Their only observ-
able is the binding of a chemoreceptor protein to glucose. The chemoreceptor sys-
tem functions as a differentiator that distinguishes between the two possible states 
(i.e., glucose binding versus no binding). Such differentiation is not a representation 
because it does not provide any additional information about glucose as object, such 
as chemical composition. If the abundance of secondary messengers generated by 
multiple receptors of the same kind exceeds a certain threshold, it is interpreted by 
flagella directly as action, which is typical for semiosis in primitive organisms that 
4  Agency in Non-human Organisms

101
has been called protosemiosis (Sharov & Vehkavaara, 2015). And second, bacteria 
are not capable of learning, which is a necessary feature of cognition. Bacterial 
signaling networks are established and maintained by hereditary factors, and thus 
we can say that bacteria follow a simple innate reflex that cannot be changed in a 
bacterium’s lifetime. Transient adjustment of receptor sensitivity (i.e., habituation) 
does not qualify as “learning” because it is non representational. Thus, the analysis 
of chemotaxis does not support the idea that bacterial sensing and action is cogni-
tive because cognition requires representational perception and learning.
Shapiro is not the only author who attributed cognition to bacteria. Discussions 
on bacterial cognition became a hot topic that was described as “cognition wars” 
(Adams, 2018). The first arguments in favor of bacterial cognition were presented 
long ago by Maturana and Varela (1980: 13), who wrote: “Living systems are cogni-
tive systems, and living as a process is a process of cognition”. For them, cognition 
was equivalent to autonomy and preservation of identity: “A cognitive system is a 
system whose organisation defines a domain of interactions in which it can act with 
relevance to the maintenance of itself” (ibid: 13).
Frederik Stjernfelt (2014) proposed that all organisms, including bacteria, are 
capable of interpreting proposition signs (or dicisigns) that generally specify the 
quality or state of an object and can be either true or false. In contrast to Peirce, who 
viewed dicisigns as elements of human language and logic, Stjernfelt proposed a 
“purely functional” interpretation of propositions, which he called “natural proposi-
tions”, where the dichotomy of true/false is replaced by success/failure (e.g., in 
survival and reproduction). For example, he considers bacterial chemotaxis as a 
proposition “if sugar, swim in its direction” (ibid: 145). Although the connection 
between glucose sensing and flagella rotation is indirectly reflected in the bacterial 
genome, bacteria do not interpret the genome as a proposition. Instead, bacteria use 
individual genes to make protein subagents for sensing, interpreting sensorial sig-
nals, and controlling the rotation of flagella. As these subagents self-organize in the 
context of bacterial cell, then they start interacting and jointly perform sensing and 
interpretation of sensorial signals. It is a set of mutually-dependent sign relations 
rather than a proposition. If bacteria were indeed capable of using propositions they 
would be rational beings as humans are.
Ben Jacob defended the idea of “social intelligence” in bacteria because “acting 
jointly, these tiny organisms can sense the environment, process information, solve 
problems and make decisions so as to thrive in harsh environments” (Ben-Jacob, 
2014). An example of complex bacterial behavior is so called “quorum sensing”:
Quorum sensing (QS) is a bacterial cell–cell communication process that involves the pro-
duction, detection, and response to extracellular signaling molecules called autoinducers 
(AIs). AIs accumulate in the environment as the bacterial population density increases, and 
bacteria monitor this information to track changes in their cell numbers and collectively 
alter gene expression. QS controls genes that direct activities that are beneficial when per-
formed by groups of bacteria acting in synchrony. Processes controlled by QS include bio-
luminescence, sporulation, competence, antibiotic production, biofilm formation, and 
virulence factor secretion (Rutherford & Bassler, 2012: 1).
4.2  The Agency of Bacteria

102
The idea of cognition in bacteria has its roots in the revolt against the dominating 
mechanistic paradigm in biology and evolutionary theory, which is certainly a sym-
pathetic motivation. However, there are multiple alternatives on how to depart from 
the monopoly of mechanistic thinking. For example, researchers associated with 
biosemiotics agree that bacteria are skilled in sensing and information processing 
without applying metaphors of cognition and intelligence. Instead, biosemioticians 
describe bacterial sensing and information processing as ‘semiosis’. We believe that 
the terminology of biosemiotics has a clear advantage because it does not deflate the 
meaning of the term ‘cognition’ and keeps it consistent with its traditional use in 
both biology and philosophy. Indeed, if cognition is equivalent to life, then biology 
needs to be renamed as cognitive science, which is a ridiculous or at least counter-
productive assertion. While the terms ‘cognition’, ‘intelligence’ and ‘conscious-
ness’ have historically had strong anthropocentric connotations, it makes more 
sense to apply them to all animals that have a central nervous system as humans do, 
than to apply these terms to any organism whatsoever (Ginsburg & Jablonka, 2019). 
In contrast, the term “semiosis” has no anthropocentric connotations,4 and thus, it 
can be applied to organisms with varying complexity levels, including bacteria.
Terminological disputes need to be resolved by developing clear definitions that 
are consistent with the historical background of each notion. Consider the definition 
proposed by Shapiro that cognition is “action based on knowledge acquired through 
sensing”. This definition seems correct if ‘action’, ‘sensing’, and ‘knowledge’ refer 
to conscious human action, sensing, and knowledge. However, it becomes debatable 
if ‘knowledge’ can be interpreted as non-mental memory, such as the information 
embedded in a genome or methylation of a protein molecule, because the level of 
complexity and plasticity is much higher in the brain than in the genome.
We agree with Shapiro (2012) that bacteria have modifiable information stor-
ages, including the genome which is dynamically marked by DNA methylation and 
epigenetic modification of histone-like proteins. The DNA sequence of bacteria is 
also dynamic due to mutations, horizontal gene transfer (HGT), and the activity of 
virus-like transposable elements. However, Shapiro’s (2011: 55, 107) metaphor of 
“natural genetic engineering” is misleading because the term ‘engineering’ implies 
rational thinking which is evidently not there. Mutations are mostly random, 
although their rates can be adaptively regulated. Genomic changes caused by trans-
posable elements and HGT are mostly harmful, although in rare cases they can be 
beneficial by accident (e.g., by acquiring resistance to viral infection or capacity of 
photosynthesis). In normal conditions, all these processes of genome ‘writing’ are 
substantially more harmful than beneficial, and there is no evidence that bacteria 
have evolved specific molecular mechanisms in order to increase the frequency of 
mutations, HGT, or an abundance of transposable elements in the genome. Thus, the 
metaphor of a ‘writable’ bacterial genome advocated by Shapiro is also misleading. 
Although there are small chances for bacteria to obtain some benefits from genome 
4 Except among anthropocentric-minded semioticians.
4  Agency in Non-human Organisms

103
changes, these benefits are accidental and have nothing to do with bacterial agency. 
In human terms, bacteria do not ‘want’ their genome to change.
Our argument, however, can be criticized by pointing out that the frequency of 
mutations, HGT, and genome rearrangement by transposable elements tend to 
increase in stressful or life-threatening conditions (Aminov, 2011; Fan et al., 2019; 
Galhardo et al., 2007), which appears as an adaptive response of bacteria because it 
provides a small chance to avoid imminent death in stress conditions by changing 
the genome. We disagree with such an explanation for two reasons. First, DNA 
damage may increase in stressful conditions as a byproduct of metabolic dysfunc-
tion caused by stress. No special mechanism or adaptation is needed for this effect. 
Because metabolic and signaling networks evolved to prevent DNA damage, the 
breakage of these networks will result in an increase of DNA damage. And second, 
even if bacterial cells indeed carry a special pathway that has no other function than 
increasing DNA damage in stressful conditions (although we are not aware of such 
pathways), such a pathway would be a heritable habit rather than intentional and 
thus cannot be called ‘genome writing’, as proposed by Shapiro.
It is also conceivable that populations and aggregations of bacteria (e.g., bacte-
rial mats) can develop adaptive capacities that make them functionally similar to 
primitive multicellular eukaryotic organisms such as sponges or trichoplex. These 
capacities may include long-term interactions with external objects potentially 
resulting in the development of primitive pathways for object recognition. These 
affordances, if they exist, can qualify as early stages of eusemiosis, but certainly not 
as cognition.
4.3  The Eukaryotic Transition
The emergence of eukaryotic cells on Earth was a major qualitative step in evolution 
that involved both structural and functional changes. The eukaryotic cell does not 
have a single organism as its ancestral origin, but instead it originated from a group 
of unrelated microbial prokaryotes that became integrated into a symbiotic unity, 
and eventually formed a higher-level organism. This process is called symbiogene-
sis (Margulis, 1970; Margulis, 1998), and has been included into the list of major 
transitions in evolutionary history (see Fig. 4.1b, c). Mikhailovsky (2018) called it 
‘hierarchogenesis’. The details of this process are still disputed. A rough estimate of 
the time of eukaryotic cell origin is ca. 2 Gy ago, and there is a general agreement 
that mitochondria, which are energy-producing organelles of the cell, originated 
from Rickettsiales or other α-proteobacteria (Curtis & Archibald, 2010). It has also 
been suggested that early eukaryotes (at 1.7  Gy ago) had no mitochondria, but 
acquired mitochondria and nucleus by 1.8 Gy (Hedges et al., 2001).
Most contemporary eukaryotic cells have a nucleus carrying chromosomes, and 
cytoplasm with various organelles, such as mitochondria, chloroplasts, golgi, endo-
plasmic reticulum, centrosome, ribosomes, and cytoskeleton. Compartmentalization 
of the cell volume and the large number of organelle types is the basis for the 
4.3  The Eukaryotic Transition

104
structural complexity of the eukaryotic cell. Compartments are connected by mem-
brane pores, assisted transport of molecules and vesicles, free-floating signaling 
molecules, and cytoskeleton filaments. Many processes that occur on the outer 
membrane of bacterial cells have become internalized in eukaryotes and moved to 
the internal membranes of various organelles (Hoffmeyer & Stjernfelt, 2016). 
Basically, all molecular mechanisms in the cell became revamped after the eukary-
otic transition. Many functions that are performed by a single protein in bacteria are 
performed by multicomponent protein complexes in eukaryotes.
The genome of eukaryotes acquired an enhanced modular organization that did 
not exist in prokaryotes. It became diploid, carrying two copies of each chromo-
some, whereas prokaryotes are mostly haploid. Two copies are needed for DNA 
repair and recombination during meiotic cell division. The genome became split 
into multiple chromosomes that can be easily recombined in meiosis. Fast replica-
tion of eukaryotic chromosomes is enabled by multiple origins of replication scat-
tered along the chromosome. The stability of the long DNA helix in each 
chromosome is supported by histone proteins which serve as a scaffold for DNA 
storage and utilization. In particular, histones are carriers of important epigenetic 
marks recognized by various molecular subagents; these marks control chromatin 
condensation, unwinding, and looping. Condensing of chromatin is also needed for 
controlled separation of chromosome copies pulled by microtubules during the 
metaphase of mitotic cell division. The function of the genome changed from mostly 
protein-coding in prokaryotes to mostly regulation and scaffolding in eukaryotes. 
An indicator of increased genome stability in eukaryotes is the reduction of muta-
tion rates and HGT rates by several orders of magnitude as compared to prokaryotes 
(Drake et al., 1998; Lynch, 2010; Koonin & Galperin, 2003).
Eukaryotic cells interact with their large-scale parts (organelles) and with exter-
nal objects, such as food particles and substrates, and these interactions last for 
some time that is likely sufficient for establishing functional semiotic interaction 
such as exploration, recognition, and utilization. This kind of interaction is not 
likely to happen in individual bacteria that respond to signals but cannot handle 
objects. Thus, it is arguably the case that eukaryotic cells cross an important semi-
otic threshold – a transition from protosemiosis to eusemiosis (Sharov & Vehkavaara, 
2015), which is discussed in Chap. 7.
4.4  The Multicellular Transition
The switch from solitary to collective life happened many times in the evolution of 
single-cell organisms: several times – in bacteria, and at the origin of multicellular 
animals, plants, and fungi. There are three main classes of multicellular bacteria: 
filaments (e.g., Cyanobacteria, Actinomycetales, Chloroflexi), aggregates (biofilms 
or swarms), and multicellular magnetotactic prokaryotes (MMPs) (Lyons & Kolter, 
2015). Filaments and aggregates have cell differentiation and intercellular signal-
ing. Filaments and some aggregates reproduce by clones, but MMPs can not survive 
4  Agency in Non-human Organisms

105
as single cells (Abreu et al., 2007). They have a round shape (Fig. 4.2), tight junc-
tions between cells, and coordinated flagellar movement. They divide by fission of 
the entire structure.
Intercellular communication is necessary in all multicellular eukaryotes. The 
slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum have unicellular as well as multicellular 
phases in its life cycle. (Margulis & Chapman, 2009: 136). In high nutrition condi-
tions, the mold lives as solitary amoeba-like cells. However, if the nutrition is 
depleted, cells emit cAMP signals to attract their neighbors and aggregate forming 
a stalk with a fruiting body on the top. In the fruiting body, some cells turn into 
spores that are carried away by wind. This is an example of the division of labor 
between cells and of altruism-like strategy because cells in the stalk supporting the 
fruiting body do not survive after the spores are dispersed.
Jesper Hoffmeyer (2015) pointed out two major benefits of multicellularity: 
larger size that gives a competitive advantage in obtaining resources, and diversifi-
cation of component cells which makes division of labor possible. In animals, hunt-
ing and grazing efficiency generally increase with body size; whereas in plants, the 
size helps to secure the sun-lit area for photosynthesis and the soil area for collect-
ing water and nutrients. The division of labor between cells increases their produc-
tivity in special tasks, and allows the development of external organs and internal 
infrastructure (e.g., skeleton, vessels, airways, and containers).
Hoffmeyer (2015: 161) considered the main challenge of multicellular organiza-
tion is “to solve the problem of how clones of cells descending from one and the 
same zygote could find ways to collaborate on the task of creating a communal self, 
where single cells work for the common good, rather than for their own best inter-
ests”. This task is solved by developing mechanisms that prevent the emergence of 
selfish mutations in individual cells. One of them is early differentiation of embry-
onic cells into the germ line that have a chance to produce sex cells (egg and sperm), 
Fig. 4.2  Bacterial

106
and somatic cells that make the body and have no chance to enter the germ line path. 
Hoffmeyer calls this separation “Weismann’s cut” (ibid: 166) in the name of August 
Weismann who discovered the unique role of germ cells.
Another challenge of multicellularity is to produce the whole body with diverse 
organs from a single cell, which is a fertilized egg. It is resolved by an extremely 
complex process which is embryogenesis. This process has to be fast in order to 
reach the functional stage of the organism as soon as possible and very efficient in 
terms of energy and material because the embryo has a limited supply of resources 
in the egg. These limitations are partially relaxed in higher animals, which devel-
oped multiple mechanisms of parental care, including vivipary, nest making, and 
progeny feeding. Embryo development is based on intensive communication 
between cells and embryonic tissues that controls the movement and differentiation 
of embryo components. Eukaryotic cells have innate capacity to interpret develop-
mental signals and follow differentiation trajectories towards various target fates. 
Mammals have several hundred types of cell in their body; thus, there should be 
specific signaling and scaffolding pathways that lead cell differentiation to each of 
these types. According to Conrad Waddington (1957), cell differentiation follows 
stable trajectories in the imaginable ‘epigenetic landscape’ (see Fig. 4.3). The val-
leys in this landscape can branch and provide decision points where the direction of 
differentiation can be chosen based on external signals and scaffolds. The effect of 
signals can then be represented by activation or repression of genes that maintain 
the shape of the epigenetic landscape.
In reality, the embryogenesis is even more complex than in the model of 
Waddington because cells communicate with their neighbors, and thus, differentia-
tion decisions are made by groups of interacting cells rather than individual cells. 
Cells obey their positional information determined by gradients of various growth 
factors and other signaling molecules (Wolpert, 2016). The initial steps of embryo 
development are always followed by correction steps when erroneously differenti-
ated cells are removed by apoptosis, and the boundaries between tissues and organs 
are improved. Simultaneously, the developing organs receive communication lines 
of blood vessels and nerves, and the organs become functional long before the

107
completion of their development. The early function of organs is a necessary condi-
tion for their proper development. Functional parts are preserved and further devel-
oped, whereas nonfunctional elements are removed and possibly replaced.
4.5  Neural Takeover
Multicellular animals require a fast internal network to support communications 
between sensors and effector organs. The earliest lineages of animals did not sur-
vive to our days, and we can only guess about their organization. Most likely they 
resembled the sponge’s larvae (Nielsen, 2008), which have several cell types but no 
neural cells. Communication between cells in ancestral animals was probably sup-
ported by the diffusion of chemicals such as calcium ions, cAMP, cytokines, and 
growth factors through the extracellular space or directly via gap junctions.
Faster signaling requires a different kind of process based on the domino effect, 
when a signal travels through an array of linked transmission agents without move-
ment of agents themselves. Such systems appeared in biological evolution in the 
form of membrane-bound ion channels and pumps. The membrane incorporates 
agent proteins and also serves as a boundary that separates the inner and outer space 
of cells. This separation allows the cell to keep a gradient of ion concentration and 
electric charge. For example, action potential in nerves travels through the sequen-
tial opening of voltage-gated sodium membrane channels, which causes the depo-
larization of the membrane, and this change opens neighboring sodium channels 
(Lodish et al., 2000) (Fig. 4.4). The voltage gradient at the cell membrane is gener-
ated by sodium-potassium pumps, which move sodium Na + out of the cell and 
potassium K+ into the cell. Because resting potassium channels allow K+ to move 
freely out of the cell, the outer surface of the membrane becomes positively charged 
and the inner surface becomes negatively charged. If the membrane potential 
decreases to a certain threshold, the voltage-gated sodium channels open and Na + is 
allowed to enter the cell. The depolarization wave rapidly spreads along the

membrane by opening nearby voltage-gated sodium channels. In neurons, these 
events generate an action potential which is an electrical spike that travels along the 
axon. When voltage-gated channels close and the membrane potential is restored, 
the cell is ready to generate another wave.
Single cell animals (e.g., ciliates and flagellates) already have ion channels and 
pumps in their membrane that support travelling waves of membrane depolarization 
that control their locomotion (Febvre-Chevalier et al., 1989). Neural cells, which 
are called neurons, reused the mechanism that already existed in single-cell organ-
isms and applied it (with modifications) for fast and long-distance signaling in mul-
ticellular animals.
Neurons possibly evolved together with immune cells from a common hormone-­
signaling ancestral cell type (Marin & Kipnis, 2013). A neuron has a cell body with 
a nucleus and other organelles (e.g., mitochondria, golgi, endoplasmic reticulum) 
and many appendages (branches) (Fig. 4.5). One of the appendages, called axon, is 
specialized in transmitting signals in one direction away from the cell body over 
long distances and may carry multiple terminals at the end for connections with 
muscle cells or other neurons. The axon is covered with lipid isolating bands, called 
myelin sheath, which are formed by appendages of Schwann cells. Other append-
ages of a neuron are called dendrites because of their abundant branching. They are 
used to transfer signals received from other neurons towards the cell body. Neurons 
connect to each other via synapses, which are small chambers where the membrane

of the axon of one cell is brought close to the membrane of a dendrite of another cell 
(Fig. 4.5).
Signal transmission in a synapse is initiated by the activation of the axon termi-
nal, which causes the release of signaling chemicals, called neurotransmitters, into 
the physical gap between membranes. The dendrite membrane of another neuron 
receives the chemical signal when neurotransmitter molecules reach the protein 
receptors that are anchored in the membrane and extend their ends into the synaptic 
cavity. The specific binding of a neurotransmitter to the receptor causes a number of 
chemical reactions in the receiving post-synaptic neuron, which may cause mem-
brane depolarization. A synapse works as a filter that transmits only strong signals, 
whereas weak signals that activate just a few receptors do not generate any action 
potential. In other words, signals are filtered by way of a lower threshold.
Neurons are organized into functional networks which empower animal behav-
iors. As an example, let’s consider a simple reflex such as pulling your hand back 
after touching a hot surface. This reflex involves at least 3 neurons: a sensory (affer-
ent) neuron is activated by pain receptors in the hand; the signal travels to the spinal 
cord, where it is transmitted to the interneuron (Fig. 4.6). The interneuron activates 
a motor neuron located nearby in the spinal cord, which sends the signal through its 
axon to the muscle that pulls the hand back.
Simple reflexes are innate and performed unconsciously. They are ubiquitous in 
invertebrates. One of the most studied is the defensive reflex of the sea slug Aplysia, 
which is a large swimming mollusk that has no shell. When an animal is touched, it

immediately retracts its siphon and gill (Carew et al., 1971; Hawkins et al., 1998). 
Theoretically, a simple reflex can be initiated by a single receptor. However, in mul-
ticellular animals, most reflexes are initiated by a large set of sensorial inputs that 
together pass specific pattern-recognition and content-enhancing filters. The result 
of filtering is more meaningful for an organism than raw signals generated by single 
receptors. Thus, a reflex is usually based on perception rather than raw sensing. For 
example, Aplysia does not respond to sensorial inputs during normal swimming but 
immediately recognizes an encounter with a solid object. The perception of animals 
is species-specific and we should not expect that it is necessarily similar to human 
perception. According to Hoffmeyer and Stjernfelt, perception does not require a 
brain but can instead be based on “bodily knowledge” as in a jellyfish. They defined 
“perception as semiotic processes informing the organism, supported by specific 
signaling systems such as nervous systems” (Hoffmeyer & Stjernfelt, 2016: 16).
Perception is especially important in visual recognition. “It is not what you see 
that is important in the struggle for survival,” as (Dretske, 1995: 118) remarks, “it is 
what you know about what you see”. The word ‘recognition’ includes ‘cognition’, 
and consequently it is tempting to assume that visual recognition always requires 
brain and thinking. A counterexample is a box jellyfish which has eyes with lenses 
and can apparently recognize patterns despite of having no brain (Garm et  al., 
2011). There may be different semiotic levels of ‘recognition’ in animals with low 
and high cognitive capacities. At the lower level, the process can resemble artificial 
neural nets that can be trained to recognize patterns without specifying their indi-
vidual properties. Most invertebrates do not spend time learning new visual pat-
terns. It is more likely that their recognition capacities have strong innate components 
and are regulated by neural networks. Such recognition mechanisms are then inte-
grated with behavioral activities into complex perception/action sequences that are 
often called instincts or habits. Instincts generally have a strong innate core, which 
emerges via evolution5; thus, they can be initiated or at least attempted without prior 
learning. Instincts in invertebrates are often fully automated and heritable. Thus, 
ants start running and butterflies start flying immediately after hatching from a 
pupa. In contrast, mammals and birds improve and stabilize their instinct-driven 
behavior; thus, their instincts combine innate and learned components. Examples of 
instincts include hunting, fighting, and sexual behaviors.
Instinctive behavior is not deterministic, given that it is adjusted and modified by 
various external and internal context factors. The mechanisms of adjustment often 
include habituation and sensitization of a reflex, summation, dominance, lateral 
repression, and pseudo-conditioning. These mechanisms should not be confused 
with learning because they are simply innate interactions among simultaneous or 
sequential innate behaviors. For example, summation reflex is usually defined (in a 
narrow sense) as accumulation of multiple repeated signals from the same upstream 
neuron (summation in time) or from multiple upstream neurons (summation in 
space) in order to accumulate excitation and trigger the action potential in the

111
downstream neuron (Levin & Saunders, 2000). In contrast, Boris Sergeev (Sergeev, 
2010) defines a summation reflex as a behavioral rather than a neurophysiological 
phenomenon, where a combination of stimuli is sufficient to cause a response, but 
each individual stimulus is not sufficient.
A theory of dominant focus, developed by a Russian physiologist Alexei 
Ukhtomsky, explains the interaction of neural processes taking place in separate 
regions of the brain. A nerve center that holds the processes that correspond to the 
focus of attention at the current moment are called dominant. It appears that neural 
processes caused by stimuli at other locations are ‘attracted’ by the dominant center 
and become interpreted in the context of the attention focus (Sergeev, 2010). 
Another type of interaction between neural processes is inhibition, when one type 
of processes represses other types. This interaction can be explained by competition 
of nerve centers for energy and communication resources. Some pairs of closely 
located nerve centers in the spinal cord exhibit reciprocal inhibition; when motor 
neurons controlling flexor muscles are activated, the motor neurons controlling 
extensor muscles are repressed and vice versa (Sergeev, 2010). Mutual repression 
among sensory neurons (e.g., visual, tactile, olfactory, or auditory) is known as lat-
eral inhibition (Yantis, 2014: 77).
Interaction between nerve centers or neurons can be easily confused with condi-
tioning and thus it is called pseudo-conditioning (Ginsburg & Jablonka, 2009: 638). 
The main difference is that conditioning is a highly specific association between the 
conditioned and unconditioned stimuli (see below), whereas in the case of pseudo-­
conditioning, other mechanisms are involved, such as sensitization or dominance.
4.6  Learning in Animals
According to Encyclopedia Britannica, learning is “the alteration of behaviour as a 
result of individual experience”.6 Another definition is that “learning is an ontoge-
netic adaptation that involves a relatively long-lasting change in behavior” (Ginsburg 
& Jablonka, 2009: 228). Ginsburg and Jablonka emphasize the importance of 
encoding: “there is no learning without the encoding, retention, and then the retrieval 
of information related to past experiences” (ibid.). We prefer the latter definition 
because it is more elaborated. In particular, it uses the criterion of long-lasting 
change in behavior, which excludes short term effects, such as habituation and sen-
sitization. Moreover, it requires the retrieval of information related to past experi-
ences which implies at least a minimal kind of representation.
The notion of representation is based on human psychology, which mechanisms 
are largely unknown; thus, we acknowledge the concerns over its scientific grounds 
expressed by the anti-psychologism school of thought. Nevertheless we believe that 
cognitive science should not ignore mental representational processes, which can be

described by higher-level criteria even in the absence of mechanistic explanation. 
The first criterion is that representations are not innate; they are mental states that 
are actively constructed by animals and persist over relatively long time. And sec-
ond, they empower organisms to delineate, track, and recognize certain objects, a 
feature that is often called ‘aboutness’. Most examples of physiological habituation 
and sensitization are non-representational because they involve tuning of already 
existing regulatory modules (neural or non-neural), and therefore do not require 
construction; and they have no ‘aboutness’. Thus, we exclude non-representational 
habituation and sensitization from learning despite the fact that these phenomena 
have been often classified as “non-associative learning” (Pear, 2014: 15).
Animals with brains often combine instinct with learning, which makes it diffi-
cult to separate these behavioral categories. This connection was first noticed by 
James (1918: vol2 ch.24). When a behavior is performed for the first time (e.g., a 
hen laying its first egg, or a baby sucking its first milk) it is based solely on the heri-
table code, but simultaneously this action brings along a new experience which 
strengthens the same behavior type in the future (Ginsburg & Jablonka, 2019: 373). 
In this case, an instinct works as a scaffold for subsequent learning, where instinct 
“is now part of the cause that leads to the construction of motivating emotion” 
(ibid.).
Imprinting is probably the simplest type of learning behaviors. Konrad Lorenz 
(1935, 1937) found that young goslings learn to follow the first large moving object 
they see after hatching. He also discovered that the mating preferences of animals 
can be influenced by imprinting of the image of foster parents of other species, even 
though imprinting of the image of conspecific parents is the norm. This phenome-
non, called sexual imprinting, has been confirmed in many birds and mammals 
(Irwin & Price, 1999). Another example of imprinting is that cuckoos are able to 
remember a habitat of their foster parents’ nest and then lay eggs in similar nests 
(Teuschl et al., 1998). Imprinting is initiated by innate mechanisms which activate 
mental representational processes. It is usually restricted to a specific life time event 
and often irreversible. Tulving (1972) distinguished between episodic memory that 
is detailed and contextual, and semantic (i.e., logical) memory. He also believed that 
episodic memory is exclusively human. However, imprinting, which is certainly 
detailed and contextual, is an example of episodic-like memory in animals.
Experimental analysis of animal learning started in the 1890s by Ivan Pavlov, 
who showed that an animal can learn to associate a new conditioned stimulus (CS) 
with a familiar unconditioned stimulus (US) that is naturally followed by some 
instinctive behavior, such as salivation after seeing food. In an experimental setup 
(Fig. 4.7), a hungry dog was exposed to a CS (e.g., sound or light) immediately 
before food was presented (US). After multiple repeats, the dog started salivating in 
response to the CS even in the absence of the US (Pavlov, 1902 [1897]). Salivation 
serves as an indicator that confirms that the association between CS and US has 
been established. Pavlov called this effect a conditioned reflex, which later became 
known as classical conditioning.
Besides performing the experiments, Pavlov has developed a theory of brain 
activities that supported the establishment of associations between previously 
4  Agency in Non-human Organisms

113
independent nerve signaling pathways. He thought that new connections are ini-
tially weak and then become stronger after reinforcement. Contemporary studies in 
neurophysiology have uncovered more detailed mechanisms of the process, 
although the whole picture is still incomplete. Establishment of association is usu-
ally attributed to synaptic plasticity, which is the ability of synapses to strengthen or 
weaken over time in response to their activity or inactivity (Hughes, 1958). But it is 
not clear how new synapse connections can be formed during a short time of train-
ing. It is unrealistic to expect that all possible synapse connections between neurons 
preexist from birth. A possible explanation is that initial associations emerge via 
indirect paths through synapses connecting multiple neurons, and then over time 
they are replaced with direct connections via newly formed synapses.
Learned information is apparently encoded not only in synapses but also in neu-
ron bodies. Ginsburg and Jablonka reviewed four types of epigenetic mechanisms 
that could be involved in storing memory traces in neurons: (a) self-sustaining feed-
back loops (e.g. gene expression), which can be regulated by Ca-dependent pro-
cesses, (b) structural templating in prions and membranes, (c) chromatin 
modifications, and (d) RNA-mediated memory (Ginsburg & Jablonka, 2019: 
316–319).
There is evidence that value-mediated learning is controlled by dopamine signal-
ing that makes synaptic connections stronger in response to a reward. According to 
Wolfram Schultz (2017: R369), “electrical or, as currently popular optogenetic,7 
dopamine stimulation induces positive learning and approach in rodents and mon-
keys, and optogenetic dopamine inhibition induces avoidance behaviour”. But other 
neurotransmitters can also participate in conditioned response (Myhrer, 2003).
Conditioning can be distinguished from long-term sensitization (i.e., pseudo-­
conditioning) by its specificity: in conditioning, the sequences of CS preceding the 
US causes a much stronger effect than random temporal sequences of US and CS 
(Ginsburg & Jablonka, 2019: 312). Another criterion of conditioning is that estab-
lished association between CS and US can be the basis for second-order

conditioning, when a different CS1 becomes associated with the initially used CS0 
causing the same response as US (ibid: 325).
A different experimental approach to the study of learning was explored by 
B. F. Skinner, who developed the methodology of behaviorism. Skinner advocated 
a scientifically-rigorous method in the analysis of behavior, where internal mental 
states and feelings of organisms are disregarded, and the research is focused on the 
relation between a history of environmental effects, such as reinforcement, and ani-
mal activity. His main discovery was that the frequency of spontaneous behaviors in 
animals changed according to their reinforcement: behaviors that are rewarded 
become more frequent, and punished behaviors become less abundant (Skinner, 
1938, 1981). This type of learning does not associate stimuli, as in Pavlov’s experi-
ments; instead it associates behaviors with reinforcement. This is called operant 
conditioning or instrumental conditioning. Animals in Skinner’s experiments were 
rewarded for instrumental actions such as pressing buttons or moving levers. The 
difference between types of conditioning is more related to the experimental setup 
rather than to the biology of learning, because in real life, “[t]here is no sharp divid-
ing line between spontaneous and stimulus-elicited behavior” (Hinde, 1966: 226). 
Colomb and Brembs (2010) explained instrumental conditioning as “self-learning” 
(i.e., evaluating actions), whereas classical conditioning is “world-learning” (i.e., 
evaluating sensory stimuli).
Based on studies of conditioning, associative learning exists in all vertebrates 
and some invertebrates, such as arthropods, crustaceans, and mollusks. In addition, 
some data is available on planaria, nematodes, and annelids (Ginsburg & Jablonka, 
2019: 294). A common feature of these animals is the presence of a brain (i.e., a 
central neural processing unit), which indicates that learning is most likely not pos-
sible without a brain.
Most experimental studies rely on combining animal learning with well-­
established instincts (e.g., imprinting or classical conditioning) or with reinforce-
ment (e.g., instrumental conditioning). This methodology, which is typical for 
behaviorism, is targeted at the effect of external stimuli and represents only a small 
subset of possible learning scenarios. Konrad Lorenz describes this bias in his book 
On Aggression: “for many decades the reaction, the ‘reflex’ represented the only 
element of behaviour which was studied by serious psychologists, while all ‘spon-
taneity’ of animal behaviour was left to the ‘vitalists’, the mystically inclined 
observers of nature” (Lorenz, 2002 [1963]: 48). Wallace Craig was among the first 
researchers who applied experimental approach to study spontaneous activity of 
animals. He showed that a male blond ring dove deprived of interaction with a 
female displayed the courtship dance in response to surrogate stimuli, such as 
stuffed pigeon (ibid.). Finally “after weeks of solitary confinement, he [male] 
directed the courtship towards the empty corner of his box-cage where the conver-
gence of the straight sides offered at least an optical fixation point” (ibid: 49). 
Moreover,
this increase of the readiness to react is far from being the only effect of the ‘damming’ of 
an instinctive activity. If the stimuli normally releasing it fail to appear for an appreciable 
period, the organism as a whole is thrown into a state of general unrest and begins to search 
4  Agency in Non-human Organisms

115
actively for the missing stimulus. [...] Wallace Craig called this type of purposive searching 
‘appetitive behaviour’ (ibid: 50).
Lorenz considers spontaneity as a hallmark of instinctive behavior, including 
aggression, fear, hunger, and sex drive.
Additional types of learning can be inferred by association with human behavior. 
For example, human perception is heavily based on a sort of learned experience that 
includes the knowledge of surrounding objects, their general appearance, individual 
features, and distribution in space and time. This kind of exploration learning occurs 
routinely and accumulates fast. Jakob von Uexküll (1982 [1940]) assumed that ani-
mals also explore their habitat and develop internal models of their environment, 
called their Umwelt. He further thought that different species of organisms perceive 
and act in their own ways in the same environment, such as a cow and an ant in a 
meadow. Another type of learning is development of sensory-motor coordination in 
young animals, who try out new movements such as walking, jumping, or flying. 
Sensory-motor learning depends on multiple mechanisms of synaptic plasticity in 
cerebellum (Boyden et al., 2004).
Learning is usually accompanied with two other aspects of neural phenomena: 
emotions and anticipation. In general, emotion is a high-value neurophysiological 
state in an organism which usually carry additional flavors, such as positive or nega-
tive, active or passive, and so on. The basic emotions in animals are fear, anger/rage, 
and pleasure (Panksepp, 2005: 64). Emotion taken out of context is not adaptive, 
and it would never arise in evolution unless it is correlated with certain internal and/
or external factors, such as hunger, danger, or success in obtaining food. Thus, at 
first emotions may have been selected because they are motivating specific adaptive 
behaviors in response to one such factor (Pinker, 1997: 342). Later on in evolution-
ary history, however, emotions acquired associations with additional factors and 
eventually turned into multifunctional value-assigning tools (Panksepp, 2005). The 
fact that emotional feelings in humans and various nonhuman animals are associ-
ated with activities in homologous regions of the brain indicates their common ori-
gin in evolution (LeDoux, 2012). Emotions are regulated in the brain by specific 
neurotransmitters. For example, pleasure and reward emotions are induced by dopa-
mine inputs from the ventral tegmental area (Ikemoto & Bonci, 2014). Another 
neurotransmitter, serotonin, modulates fear memory acquisition and expression, 
although the mechanism of fear conditioning is not clear (Bocchio et al., 2016).
Anticipation is activity that is associated with an expected event, including men-
tal and physiological preparation (e.g., salivating before meal), mental representa-
tion (imagination and/or prediction), and emotions (e.g., excitement). The relations 
between these components may vary. For example, preparatory emotions may lack 
any representation, or emotions may follow anticipatory representations 
(Castelfranchi & Miceli, 2011). Anticipation is a more powerful psychological tool 
than emotion alone because of its preparatory and representational components, and 
its stronger association with reality. If the outcome of real processes exceeds expec-
tations, then an organism will likely feel joy and surprise (second-order emotions) 
and possibly modify its expectations at the next occurrence of a similar situation. 
4.6  Learning in Animals

116
But if the expected outcome did not materialize or appeared much weaker, then an 
animal will get sad, disappointed or bewildered and possibly lower its expectations 
next time. As a result, anticipation behaviors become adjusted to reality via emo-
tional feedback, which is one of the mechanisms that make learning fine-tuned.
Interaction between anticipation and learning has been explored in the toy model 
of associative learning by Ginsburg and Jablonka (2019: 322-328). The model uti-
lizes the notion of “reward prediction error” introduced by Wolfram Schultz (Schultz 
& Dickinson, 2000). According to Schultz, a prediction error (PE) is a surprise 
value that can be positive or negative depending on whether the real reward is 
greater or smaller than predicted/anticipated (Schultz, 2016). He wrote:
Prediction is a state that contains information about the future [...] A reward prediction 
error, then, is the difference between a reward that is being received and the reward that is 
predicted to be received. A reward prediction error can be quantified in any useful physical 
(objective) or subjective unit of reward (Schultz, 2017: R369).
Objective measures may include energy balance or dopamine production by cer-
tain neurons (Idid.). According to the model of Ginsburg and Jablonka (2019: 324), 
an animal learns to associate CS with a subsequent US (reward) as follows:
The prediction error (λ − V) is computed in the facilitatory interneuron neuron (FAC INT) 
as the difference between the actual reinforcement λ delivered by the sensory neuron SN2 
and the inhibitory output [V] of the motor neuron MN [...] to the FAC INT. The prediction 
error changes the efficacy of the synaptic connection between the sensory neuron SN1, 
which delivers the CS, and the motor neuron.
The effect of this network of neurons is minimization of prediction error, which 
means that by tuning their anticipations, animals can learn to predict future rewards 
more accurately and minimize the level of surprise. This model can also be pre-
sented in terms of Bayes’ equation (Ginsburg & Jablonka, 2019: 355), where new 
data on reward value (evidence) is used to update and improve the earlier hypothesis

4.7  Consciousness and Cognition in Animals
There is no consensus among biologists and philosophers on where to draw a line to 
separate the lower-level behaviors of animals that are based mostly on instinct from 
higher-level mental functions that somewhat resemble human consciousness or cog-
nition. In most contexts, cognition is equivalent to consciousness, but the term ‘cog-
nition’ appears better suited for describing the evolutionary level of mental functions 
in animals because ‘consciousness’ has an additional meaning of ‘being awake’.
According to the Declaration on Consciousness,9
The absence of a neocortex does not appear to preclude an organism from experiencing 
affective states. Convergent evidence indicates that non-human animals have the neuroana-
tomical, neurochemical, and neurophysiological substrates of conscious states along with 
the capacity to exhibit intentional behaviors. [...] Nonhuman animals, including all mam-
mals and birds, and many other creatures, including octopuses, also possess these neuro-
logical substrates.
Ginsburg and Jablonka (2019) connect the origin of consciousness with the 
Cambrian explosion in the evolution of animals: “Our investigations led us to sug-
gest that consciousness appeared during the Cambrian era in the first vertebrates 
and, in parallel or somewhat earlier, in arthropods and possibly in other invertebrate 
groups” (ibid: 223), such as Cephalopods. In particular, “Octopuses can classify and 
categorize objects and discriminate among them using size, shape, and intensity; 
they can find their way in complex mazes, rapidly learn by observation from other 
octopuses, and use abandoned shells for protection” (ibid: 222). Ginsburg and 
Jablonka proposed that the line distinguishing sentient animals correspond to a tran-
sition from the limited associative learning (LAL) to unlimited associative learning 
(UAL), where unlimited learning means increasing the potential number of learned 
stimuli and sequences of actions so that “the number of associations far exceeds 
those that actually form during the individual’s lifetime” (ibid: 225). One of the 
motivations for selecting this criterion was a parallel with “unlimited heredity” pro-
posed by Maynard-Smith and Szathmáry (1995) as one of the major transitions in 
the evolution of heredity. Ginsburg and Jablonka (2019: 230-232) suggested an 
‘operational’ definition of UAL that includes the following three conditions: (1) 
“the animal should be able to associate a compound conditioned stimulus, a CS, [...] 
to an unconditioned stimulus (US)”, (2) “the stimulus or the reinforced action must 
be novel”, and (3) “the learned compound CS (or the learned sequence of actions) 
is not only recalled as being integrated but can subsequently support second-order, 
cumulative conditioning, thus itself acting as a US (or reinforcement)”. Compound 
stimuli are also known as “perceptual fusion” (Miller & D’Esposito, 2005), and 
learning to recognize them is “non-elemental learning” (Giurfa, 2003).
Ginsburg and Jablonka (2019: 402) compiled a list of features typical for con-
sciousness10: (i) global activity and differentiated states, (ii) binding and unification

of perceptions, (iii) intentionality, (iv) selection, plasticity, learning, and attentional 
modulation, (v) temporal thickness (interconnecting past and future), (vi) attribu-
tion of values, emotions, goals, and (vii) embodiment, agency, and self. Merker 
(2005) proposed that consciousness appeared in actively moving visual animals and 
its main function is coordination between selection of target object, action selection, 
and motivation. According to Shettleworth (2010: 4), cognition mechanisms 
“include perception, learning, memory, and decision-making”.
Out of various described criteria of cognition, the most specific appears to be 
learning, which is clearly opposed to the activity of animals with innate habits. 
Other criteria (e.g., perception, memory, motivation, and decision-making) seem to 
be present in some animals with heritable behaviors. For example, short-term mem-
ory can be based on genetically encoded neural networks. Similar to many other 
qualitative thresholds in the organization of agency, cognition is not a “yes-or-no” 
feature; instead there is a threshold zone where cognitive behaviors that involve 
learning are expressed to varying extent. The efficiency and capacity of learning has 
increased in animal evolution as a result of several facilitating behavioral compo-
nents. Thus, LAL and UAL can be interpreted as weak and strong cognition, respec-
tively. Criteria of UAL include the ability of an animal to develop associations with 
arbitrarily selected compound stimuli in the lab (Ginsburg & Jablonka, 2019: 
230–232). This approach seems too artificial to be used as a benchmark of cognitive 
capacities of wild animals, especially if they were not exposed to deliberately con-
structed compound stimuli. Thus, we do not use UAL as a criterion of minimal 
consciousness, as proposed by Ginsburg and Jablonka (ibid: 226).
The capacity of UAL manifests a quantitatively higher-level of mental organiza-
tion in some animals as compared to basic cognition which is based on simple 
conditioning. In these animals, both emotion and anticipation, discussed in the pre-
vious subsection, can be strengthened due to association with compound stimuli. 
Higher levels of cognition can be also associated with awareness and orientation. 
Active information gathering (awareness) helps animals in finding food items and in 
early detection of danger. The orientation reflex is a capacity of animals to identify 
new objects, features, or new combinations of stimuli in order to explore them in 
more detail. Learning becomes more efficient when animals do not pay attention to 
familiar objects and spend more time exploring the unknown.
Another criterion of advanced cognition in animals is reflective cognition, when 
animals recognize themselves and other animals as conscious agents. This capacity 
could have originated from sexual rituals, where it is important to establish predict-
able interactions with a sex partner. A common pathway for admitting cognition in 
others is parental care and communal life. Parents need to establish reciprocal com-
munication with their progeny, whereas social animals use interactive communica-
tion to coordinate group activities such as hunting, rank-based mating, or long-range 
movements. Reflective cognition can facilitate imagination and play behaviors, 
where goals and actions are displayed by pretence. Also, it promotes imitation 
between relatives or peers, which can accelerate learning. Imitation has other func-
tions in social animals, such as propagation of alarm calls in velvet monkeys 
(Hoffmeyer, 2008: 269–270).

In evaluating the cognitive capacities of animals we are anthropocentric by 
default, since we are born as humans. We therefore have a natural tendency to value 
the cognitive capacities of primates, and especially apes, who are our closest phylo-
genetic relatives. Indeed, apes demonstrate advanced behaviors such as direct prob-
lem solving (i.e., bypassing trials and errors), partial understanding of human 
language, and even communicating by sign language (Parker & Gibson, 1990). 
There are never-ending debates on the depth of behavioral and communication sim-
ilarities and differences between humans and non-human primates (Sebeok & 
Umiker-Sebeok, 1980). Some authors defend human superiority, whereas others 
emphasize similarities and pluralism. We are strongly against the monopoly of 
anthropocentric theories. The evolutionary value of human cognition is still up for 
discussion. Although humans indeed have achieved substantial progress in the 
development of culture and technology, this apparent progress has also destroyed 
the habitats of many other species of plants and animals, and may some day threaten 
the survival of our own species. Thus, we need to acknowledge the progress in agen-
tial evolution in other species. Non-human animals have learned to fly in the air and 
swim in the sea. Flying requires entirely different sensorimotor circuits that our 
brain cannot support. We cannot see ultraviolet light and hear ultrasound, but some 
animals can. Thus, in some agential and cognitive features, non-human animals 
clearly have superior capabilities compared to humans.

Origins of Life
Abstract  The origin of life involves a transition from a merely physical world into 
the world of semiotic agency. Attempts to explain the origin of life by synthesis of 
such organic molecules as peptides or nucleic acids is baseless, because amino acids 
and nucleotides are products of the evolving life rather than parts from which the 
first living system was assembled. We follow the footsteps of Oparin and Dyson in 
reconstructing primordial self-propagating functional molecular networks. Such 
networks were initially non-genetic and presumably similar to “lipid world” vesi-
cles. Components of these networks were simple catalysts resembling contempo-
rary coenzymes which might have colonized the surface of small oil droplets in 
water, where oil (mostly alkanes) was both a substrate and nutrient. Coenzyme-like 
molecules (CLMs) changed the surface properties of oil droplets, and in this way 
created favorable conditions for their own self-reproduction. Heredity was sup-
ported by a transfer of CLMs to daughter oil droplets following an accidental split 
of parental droplets. Niche-dependent self-reproduction and natural selection were 
necessary conditions for the emergence of cooperation between different kinds of 
CLMs that inhabited the same oil droplet. Eventually, some CLMs formed poly-
mers and their adaptive evolution resulted in the emergence of template-based syn-
thesis similar to that of nucleic acids. Oil droplets eventually transformed into the 
outer membrane of cells via engulfing water, stabilization of the surface, and osmo-
regulation. As a result, the metabolism was internalized, allowing cells to accumu-
late free-floating resources, which was a necessary condition for the emergence of 
protein synthesis. This scenario covers a long evolutionary path from simple but 
already functional and evolvable molecules to cellular organisms comparable to the 
Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA).

5.1  Most Popular Scenarios: RNA World 
and Autocatalytic Sets
Studying the origin of life is hardly justified by its practical significance, since this 
event is separated by billions of years from our time and not likely to be reproduced 
experimentally. But it has an enormous importance for the theory of agency, because 
it involves discussion of the transition from the physical world into the world of life 
and agency. It implies that life started from non-living physical parts and then 
evolved from its simple versions towards progressively more complex organisms. 
The discussion on the origin of life has some similarity to the dispute in the nine-
teenth century on the possibility of spontaneous generation of life, or “spontogene-
sis” (Turner, 2013). Early proponents of materialism thought that life emerges 
spontaneously in any rotten food or liquid. This dispute was won by the opponents 
of spontogenesis, who were mostly vitalists, after Luis Pasteur proved that boiled 
broth does not get spoiled and bacterial cells come only from parental cells of the 
same kind. The question about the origin of life considers a similar dilemma but 
applied to much longer time scales. In this case, most biologists accept that the rel-
evant concept is abiogenesis, which is the emergence of primordial life from inor-
ganic components (Peretó, 2005; Orgel, 2004). Although the possibility of 
abiogenesis is hard to prove experimentally (see Sect. 5.11), it is supported by the 
following reasoning: primordial life was simple enough to originate by chance, and 
in the very beginning, it enabled natural selection which provided means for subse-
quent adaptive evolution (Szathmáry, 1999; Segré et al., 2000; Nghe et al., 2015).
There is no consensus among biologists on the definition of life. According to 
“NASA definition” that was collectively assembled more than two decades ago, life 
is a “self-sustaining chemical system capable of Darwinian evolution” (Benner, 
2010: 1022). But the theories of abiogenesis are mostly focused on the emergence 
of macromolecules: nucleic acids, proteins, and phospholipids from simpler mole-
cules. The RNA world scenario is perhaps the most widely accepted hypothesis in 
the field of the origin of life (Orgel, 2004; Robertson & Joyce, 2012). It assumes that 
initially living systems had self-replicating nucleic acids (Gilbert, 1986) or other 
kinds of similar heteropolymers such as TNA or PNA (Nelson et al., 2000; Orgel, 
2000). And indeed, some RNA molecules can catalyze the polymerization of other 
RNAs (Johnston et al., 2001), which is by some taken as a confirmation of the RNA-­
world hypothesis. What is most appealing with this hypothesis is the assumption 
that primordial replication systems were identical to the present-day nucleic acids, 
thus there is no need to discuss alternative mechanisms of heredity. The gene is 
believed to be the main unit of heredity, and thus, naturally, the RNA world hypoth-
esis equates the origin of life to the origin of genes (Turner, 2013: 191).
Some researchers see the RNA world as an intermediate step in evolution that 
followed from simpler kinds of primordial systems (Bernhardt, 2012). Bernhardt 
mentioned the following main objections to the RNA world as the initial stage of 
life: RNA is too complex to have arisen prebiotically; it is highly unstable, and gen-
erally is a weak catalyst. Most catalysis in living cells is performed by proteins, and 
5  Origins of Life

125
thus it is logical to assume that proteins rather than nucleic acids were first mole-
cules that drove the emergence of life. This class of scenarios is known as the “pro-
tein world” hypothesis (Rauchfuss & Mitchell, 2009); it has been supported by 
experiments of polypeptide synthesis in conditions imitating hydrothermal vents 
(Lahav et al., 1978; Matsuno, 1997). In contrast to nucleic acids, however, neither 
proteins nor their precursors – unfolded polypeptides – can replicate, which is a 
serious theoretical obstacle.
An elegant solution for the “protein world” scenario was proposed by Stuart 
Kauffman, who suggested that short polypeptides can act as catalysts for the synthe-
sis of other short polypeptides. Although the product is not identical to the catalyst, 
it is theoretically possible that some set of peptides is collectively autocatalytic in a 
sense that the synthesis of each peptide is catalyzed by some other peptides in the 
same set (Kauffman, 1986). The concept of autocatalytic sets is not limited to poly-
peptides. It can be applied to any organic molecules that support catalysis, including 
nucleic acids. Mathematical models were used to demonstrate the emergence of an 
autocatalytic set in a mixture of polypeptides with randomly assigned catalytic 
activities (Kauffman, 1986; Hordijk & Steel, 2004). Potential weakness points of 
the autocatalytic set scenario are the lack of resources (e.g., amino acids) and dis-
sipation via dispersion. To prevent dispersion, a chemical system needs to be iso-
lated either by enclosure or by attachment to a suitable surface.
The notion of self-reproduction has not been properly defined in theories of the 
RNA world and autocatalytic sets. It is necessary to consider specific stoichiometry 
constraints, where a sequence of internal reactions can increase the number of all 
molecular species within the set (Sharov, 1992). It appears that such systems always 
have a unique minimum core with at least one “reproduction” reaction that gener-
ates an additional molecule that can complete a cycle of subsequent reactions. Self-­
reproducing systems can propagate in their habitat, which is similar to the growth 
and expansion of a population of living organisms (Gray & Scott, 1994; Tilman & 
Kareiva, 1997).
Autocatalytic sets have at least two alternative steady states: “on” and “off”; 
thus, they represent the simplest hereditary system or memory unit (Jablonka & 
Szathmáry, 1995). A biochemical example of a self-reproducing autocatalytic set is 
a Calvin cycle (also known as a reverse citric acid cycle), which has a “reproduc-
tion” reaction: a ribulose 1 5 bisphosphate molecule divides into two molecules of 
3-phosphoglycerate after acquiring carbon dioxide as a resource. It was speculated 
that the Calvin cycle without protein enzymes could have been the first self-­
reproducing system at the origin of life (Hartman, 1998; Morowitz et al., 2000). 
However, the network modeling approach suggested that the Calvin cycle had a low 
probability of a random realization and the length and cost of the cycle are close to 
the extreme values (Zubarev et al., 2015). Thus, the Calvin cycle is likely a product 
of adaptive evolution via natural selection. Because natural selection requires hered-
ity, heredity should have existed before the emergence of the Calvin cycle.
5.1  Most Popular Scenarios: RNA World and Autocatalytic Sets

126
5.2  Primordial Soup and Chemical Evolution
Both scenarios, the RNA world and the protein world, assume that life originated in 
a so called “primordial soup” – a rich and diverse mixture of organic molecules in 
water. Various versions of a primordial soup can easily be prepared in a lab from 
inorganic components. In the famous experiment of Miller (1953), amino acids and 
other organic molecules were synthesized from inorganic gases and water by elec-
tric sparks. It was shown that nucleotides can be synthesized under presumably 
realistic abiotic conditions (Levy et al., 2000; Sanchez et al., 1968; Powner et al., 
2009; Benner et al., 2012). Thanks to sensitive instruments, various organic mole-
cules (amino acids, nucleotides, carbohydrates) have been identified in meteorites 
(Callahan et al., 2011; Cooper et al., 2001). All these facts are seen as evidence that 
a primordial soup could easily emerge on Earth prior to life.
The notion of primordial soup, however, remains purely theoretical. Nobody has 
shown that the concentration of diverse organic molecules under abiotic conditions 
can reach physiological thresholds comparable to those in living cells and support 
primitive metabolism. The natural concentration of nucleotides and amino acids is 
negligibly small without life, and not sufficient to make polymers (Luisi, 2015; 
Klevenz et al., 2010). For example, in the Murchison meteorite, nucleobases and 
sugars are present at a concentration of only ~1 ppm (Callahan et al., 2011; Cooper 
et al., 2001). Special mechanisms, such as thermal gradients across microporous 
minerals (Deamer & Georgiou, 2015; Copley et al., 2007), cycles of evaporation 
and rewetting (Damer, 2016), or selective absorption on clay particles (Bernal, 
1951), have to be invoked to produce somewhat higher concentrations from dilute 
sources. But the capacity of these mechanisms to yield physiological concentration 
of amino acids or nucleotides has not been demonstrated.
Another potential source of diverse organic molecules is chemical evolution that 
possibly occurs in inorganic compartments of hydrothermal vents (Ikehara, 2016; 
Benner et al., 2012; Koonin & Martin, 2005). Wächtershäuser (1988) thought that 
the energy from oxidation of FeS to FeS2 at the sea floor was used for direct reduc-
tion of CO2 and subsequent organic synthesis. He further suggested that life started 
from autocatalytic molecules similar to nicotinamide NADP+ or thiamine pyro-
phosphate (TPP), and that negatively charged organic molecules were adsorbed and 
concentrated on positively charged pyrite mineral surfaces. A related model assumed 
that formaldehyde was synthesized using reduction of CO2 catalyzed by UV radia-
tion and ZnS in compartments of hydrothermal vents (Mulkidjanian & Galperin, 
2007, 2009; Mulkidjanian, 2009). Then, the formose reaction was inferred to pro-
duce carbohydrates from formaldehyde. After that it is possible to speculate that 
RNA-mediated catalysis yields nucleotides from bases and sugars (Unrau & Bartel, 
1998). However, such scenarios are all unrealistic because formaldehyde concentra-
tions in simulated hydrothermal vent conditions are in the nanomolar range (Herschy 
et al., 2014), which is million fold smaller than the concentration required for the 
formose reaction (Michitaka et al., 2017). Thus, carbohydrates as well as more com-
plex molecules are unlikely to emerge in sufficient quantities following this 
5  Origins of Life

127
scenario. Thus, neither chemical evolution nor a primordial soup can provide 
resources for self-replication of polymers (Lane et al., 2010; Lane et al., 2013).
The abundance of chemical monomers is a critical factor that determines the pos-
sibility of self-production of polymers. For example, a nucleic acid polymer would 
not be able to replicate if only a few nucleotides appear in its close proximity. By a 
lucky chance, there may be enough nucleotides to complete one round of replica-
tion, but there would be no monomers left for the next round of replication. Thus, 
life could not have started with replication of nucleic acids or peptides. Such poly-
mers may persist only on the condition of an unlimited supply of monomers, and 
this requires a heritable mechanism for their synthesis from more simple and abun-
dant organic and non-organic resources (Copley et al., 2007; Sharov, 2009, 2016). 
This means that amino acids and nucleotides are products of life rather than precur-
sors. Moreover, they emerged via natural selection rather than chemical evolution.
5.3  Agential Approach to the Origin of Life
Despite of the large number of publications on the origin of life (cf. reviews: Ikehara, 
2016; Sponer et al., 2016; Weber, 2007), the problem is generally not addressed 
from the perspective of agency and function. Instead most researchers discuss the 
possible origins of specific molecules. Life is often confused with self-organization 
or autocatalysis, such as in crystal growth or dissipative structures (e.g., hurricanes, 
tornados, and flames) (Kauffman, 1986; Egel, 2012), even though these features are 
not in themselves sufficient for life. Self-organization has one important aspect that 
is necessary for life – namely the capacity to persist, despite perturbations, via posi-
tive feedback driven by dissipating energy. But neither self-organization nor auto-­
catalysis is sufficient for establishing or maintaining life. Physical self-organized 
systems eventually stop functioning without affecting any future self-organizing 
events, whereas living systems produce the next generation of living systems of the 
same kind (Deacon & Koutroufinis, 2014).
The problem of the origin of life cannot be adequately addressed by focusing 
solely on one specific component of cells. It is for instance meaningless to separate 
metabolism entirely from heredity, because metabolism can persist and evolve only 
if it is heritable, and heredity, in turn, requires metabolism as a source of organic 
molecules and energy (Jablonka & Szathmáry, 1995). Models of prebiotic networks 
suggest the importance of combinations of various kinds of molecules (Caetano-­
Anolles & Seufferheld, 2013; Nghe et al., 2015). Thus, we need to envision primor-
dial living systems as multi-component functional agents capable of capturing 
resources, dispersion, and heritable self-reproduction. Functions then emerged and 
changed simultaneously with chemical and structural changes. It is decisive to iden-
tify a context/niche in which organic molecules may become functional.
The agential approach to the origin of life can be traced back to the early theories 
proposed by Alexander Oparin (1953 [1924]) and John Haldane (1929), both of 
whom considered the importance of two levels: molecular and proto-cellular in the 
5.3  Agential Approach to the Origin of Life

128
organization of primordial life. They both assumed a period of accumulation of 
various organic molecules in water (e.g., a primordial soup). In addition, Haldane 
envisioned the importance of autocatalysis. Both considered the self-organization of 
organic molecules into proto-cells that carried out primitive metabolic functions. 
Oparin’s theorized cells formed via a liquid phase separation process, whereas 
Holdane considered cells enclosed in an “oily film” (i.e., membrane). Haldane 
emphasized the importance of self-reproducing gene-like hereditary molecules in 
these proto-cells.
Later versions of the agential model of abiogenesis were developed by Tibor 
Gánti (1971, 2003 [1971]), Freeman Dyson (1999), and Terrence Deacon (2006). 
Gánti proposed a chemoton model that specified the chemistry of simple metabolic 
functions in primordial cells, including replication of a template, metabolism, and 
waste disposal (Fig. 5.1). The system is enclosed in a semi-permeable membrane 
and includes multiple coupled autocatalytic cycles. Heredity is supported by tem-
plate replication. Gánti provided detailed kinetic model that includes carefully 
defined stoichiometry relations for each reaction. In the presence of sufficient 
resources, the system can reproduce by fission, and progeny cells receive copies of 
heredity molecules with possible mutations. Thus, the chemoton can theoretically 
evolve by natural selection. Gánti considered it as a hypothetical ancestor of all liv-
ing organisms. However, the chemoton is too complex to self-assemble by chance.
Another scenario is the assumption that self-replicating virus-like nucleic acids 
could have originated within mineral compartments of hydrothermal vents (Koonin 
& Martin, 2005; Koonin, 2009). The main difference from the chemoton model is 
that this model does not require a membrane because mineral compartments serve 
as natural enclosures. The main weakness of this model is its inability to explain the 
supply of monomers (e.g., nucleotides and amino acids) in physiological concentra-
tions (see above).

129
The only way to develop more realistic models of abiogenesis is to assume that 
life originated long before genes, and that hereditary functions were initially sup-
ported by self-renewal of component molecules via autocatalysis and/or cross-­
catalysis. Such a scenario was first proposed by Freeman Dyson (1999), who 
assumed that primordial cells with primitive metabolism emerged before nucleic 
acids did. He further discussed the scenario of RNA emergence via polymerization 
of ATP-like molecules, and the subsequent genetic takeover in evolution that wiped 
out the evidence of the earlier non-genetic life forms.
Terrence Deacon developed a model of a non-genetic primordial system called 
autogen1 (Fig. 5.2), which besides cross-catalysis included self-assembly of a multi-­
component unit that resembles a viral capsid (Deacon et al., 2014). This structure 
may have functioned for long-term survival in unfavorable conditions. Deacon sees 
the specific feature of life in “teleodynamics”, which is an intrinsic tendency to cre-
ate higher-order constraints that are beneficial for the self-organization of the whole 
system (Deacon, 2011). Teleodynamics is one of the features of what we call 
‘agency’. Deacon has admitted that his autogen model has serious challenges. In 
particular, the emergence and self-propagation of autogens requires conditions that 
do not exist without life, such as “(1) presence of significant quantities and concen-
trations of large polymers; (2) some considerable degree of structural similarity 
among these molecules; and (3) sufficient variety and degeneracy of their stereo-
chemical properties to support spontaneous autocatalysis and self-assembly” 
(Deacon, 2006: 145).
Another model of a primordial non-genetic system is based on chemical net-
works enclosed in compartments (Vasas et  al., 2012), where each compartment 
includes an equivalent of a Kauffman’s (1986) autocatalytic set. However, the popu-
lation of compartments in this model showed no capacity to evolve via natural 
selection, because the chemical composition of all compartments converged to the 
1 Initially it was called ‘autocell’ (Deacon, 2006).

same core (Vasas et al., 2012). Evolvability was observed only after the authors 
added a possibility of rare new molecular species appearing in the system.
5.4  Lipid World and Heritability in Molecular Assemblies
If no primordial soup existed, then there are only two alternative options for getting 
the versatile organic molecules necessary for life: fixation of gaseous components 
(CO2, CO, CH4), or decomposition of oil (i.e., a mixture of liquid hydrocarbons), 
which is the most abundant non-gaseous organic resource in the universe (Deamer, 
2011). The first option was explored by Hartman (1998) and Morowitz et al. (2000), 
who speculated that the Calvin cycle without protein enzymes could have been the 
first self-reproducing system at the origin of life. However, the Calvin cycle requires 
a lot of energy (e.g., ATP), which is not available in simple molecular assemblies. 
Also, simulations of molecular network structure have suggested that the Calvin 
cycle has extremely low probability of random realization (Zubarev et al., 2015). 
Thus, it is unlikely that life started from CO2 fixation.
The idea of the origin of life on oil droplets in water is partially consistent with 
the “lipid-world” scenario for the origin of life (Segré et al., 1998, 2000, 2001). 
According to the Graded Autocatalysis Replication Domain (GARD) model, amphi-
philic and hydrophobic molecules (e.g., lipids, amino acids, or alkenes) self-­
aggregate into vesicles in water and control association and dissociation rates for 
other molecules (Segré et al., 1998). Vesicles grow by accumulating molecules from 
the water solution and then divide after reaching a certain size (Fig. 5.3). Computer 
simulations showed that such self-reproducing vesicles segregate into multiple pop-
ulations, each characterized by a distinct metabolism, proving that heritable repro-
duction can be supported by a network of molecular interactions (i.e., compositional 
heredity) and does not require nucleic acids (Segré et al., 2001). However, further 
analysis of evolutionary dynamics indicated that lineages of vesicles described by

131
the GARD model do not have sufficient evolvability and thus cannot support open-­
ended evolution (Vasas et al., 2015). The main factor that limits evolvability in the 
GARD model is the lack of covalent bond catalysis capable of generating novel 
kinds of molecules that have not existed in the environment before.
A more advanced GARD model (called P-GARD) assumes polymerization of 
simple molecules into short oligomers via covalent bonds catalyzed by other com-
ponents of the assembly (Shenhav et al., 2005). This modification solves the evolv-
ability problem, because newly synthesized molecules can be unique and stable due 
to covalent bonds, and hence, they can perform hereditary functions. The appear-
ance of new molecule types or deletion of a molecule type is equivalent to mutation. 
These “mutations” change the rates of vesicle self-reproduction, and then the most 
successful lineage of vesicles (in terms of natural selection) becomes dominant 
(Inger et al., 2009). Further increase in evolvability can be achieved by an additional 
assumption that evolving lineages of vesicles modify their environment (Shenhav 
et al., 2007). P-GARD can be viewed as a hybrid model that places an autocatalytic 
set of molecules (Kauffman, 1986) into a hydrophobic vesicle of the GARD model. 
Another advantage of the P-GARD model is that it becomes independent from the 
assumption of a primordial soup. If autocatalytic molecular networks can make new 
kinds of molecules, then there is no need to assume a huge variability of organic 
resources in the environment. It is sufficient to have one or a few of major resources.
5.5  Coenzyme World
One of the authors of the current book has taken a somewhat similar approach to the 
P-GARD model and developed a coenzyme-world scenario of the origin of life, 
which assumes that primordial autocatalytic molecular networks emerged on the 
surface of oil droplets (Sharov, 2009, 2016).2 The first heritable autocatalytic net-
works were composed of relatively simple molecules (not polymers) that repro-
duced via conditional autocatalysis. Presumably, these molecules ware catalytically 
active and thus may have resembled existing coenzymes. Because many coenzymes 
(e.g., ATP, NAD, and CoA) are similar to nucleotides, we can consider them as 
potential evolutionary predecessors of RNA and DNA nucleotides (Kritsky & 
Telegina, 2004). Of these coenzymes, the AMP-containing cofactors seem to be 
most ancient (Yarus, 2011). This observation justifies the use of the term “coenzyme 
world” for this scenario.
Life could not have originated in a homogeneous 3-dimensional space, because 
high dimensionality slows down molecular interactions. Chemical reactions go 
faster on a surface than in a volume because molecules encounter each other more 
2 P-GARD model does not differentiate between the surface and inner space in the vesicle. The 
kinetics of chemical reactions depends on dimensionality, and thus it is different on the surface and 
inside a vesicle. Thus, the coenzyme-world model requires a different mathematical formalism 
than P-GARD, but it has not been developed yet.

readily in two dimensions than in three dimensions (Adam & Delbrück, 1968). 
Surfaces play an extraordinary important role in living cells and within bodies 
(Hoffmeyer, 1998). Most functional surfaces are represented by bilayer phospho-
lipid membranes, which separate cells from the environment, prevent the dissipa-
tion of cell resources, provide a sensorial interface with the outside world, support 
the structural scaffold for the cell, and carry tools for cell propulsion (e.g., flagella 
or pseudopodia). Eukaryotic cells have additional membrane functions associated 
with endoplasmic reticulum, nuclear envelope, and various organelles, such as 
mitochondria, plastids, golgi, vacuoles, and secretion vesicles.
Let us consider what kinds of surfaces could have been important for the origin 
of life. Among surfaces available on Earth-like planets (i.e. rocky planets with water 
and suitable atmospheric conditions for life), two kinds can be considered the most 
likely places for the origin of life: water–mineral and water–oil surfaces. Here, by 
“oil” we mean various hydrocarbons, mostly alkenes, which are likely to exist on 
early terrestrial planets (Marcano et al., 2003). These two kinds of surfaces are 
selected for discussion because they both include water. Life could not originate 
without water because most chemical reactions in living cells require water. We do 
not discuss air-water surface because it is too unstable and subject to wind and 
radiation. In this chapter we focus mostly on water-oil surfaces because (1) oil self-­
aggregates in water forming fine droplets or microspheres, which resemble living 
cells and can divide or merge, (2) oil-attached molecules are not fixed in space but 
can move around the surface and have a chance to interact with other oil-attached 
molecules, (3) oil can be used as a source of carbon for primordial life, and (4) oil 
droplets could be eventually transformed into a (phospho)lipid membrane (see Sect. 
5.9.). Mineral-water surfaces do not have these features, and are therefore less likely 
to have supported the emergence of the first self-reproducing and evolving molecu-
lar networks. Mineral surfaces may nevertheless have facilitated the origin of life if 
they were physically attached to oil droplets in water, given that minerals can sup-
port catalysis (Wächtershäuser, 1988).
Oil surfaces can be colonized from the water side by catalytically active self-­
reproducing simple molecules which could be precursors of life. We call them 
coenzyme-­like molecules (CLMs) because they may resemble coenzymes (Sharov, 
2009). Catalysis is necessary for self-reproduction of CLMs as well as for modifica-
tion of other molecules on the surface. Let us consider a hypothetical scenario of 
how CLMs can colonize the surface of oil droplets in water. Assume that simple 
precursors of CLMs exist in water but cannot anchor to the hydrophobic oil surface. 
However, some oil droplets may include a few fatty acids molecules with hydro-
philic ends that allow the precursors to attach and make a functional CLM (Fig. 5.4a). 
This CLM can now catalyze the oxidation of outer ends of adjacent hydrocarbons in 
the oil droplet, making more fatty acids, where additional CLMs can be assembled 
from precursors with (or without) catalytic help from already existing CLMs on the 
surface (Fig. 5.4b). A CLM is therefore a simple agent that performs two functions: 
self-reproduction (autocatalysis) and niche construction, which is making the oil 
droplet more accessible to CLM precursors.
5  Origins of Life

133
Fatty acids produced by CLMs make the surface hydrophilic, and this increases 
the chance of a droplet to split into smaller ones (Fig. 5.4c). Later, small droplets 
can coalesce with other oil droplets, i.e., capture new oil resources (Fig. 5.4d). Some 
components of CLMs could come from the oil phase rather than from the water. 
These may include microelements as well as organic molecules. Furthermore, some 
organic molecules can be obtained via degradation of oil itself. The hypothesis that 
oil droplets served not just as a habitat but also as a source of carbon for self-­
reproduction of CLMs seems very attractive because oil provides abundant organic 
resources. In particular, some organic molecules could have been derived from fatty 
acids by pathways similar to the beta-oxidation pathway. The idea that hydrocar-
bons were used by primordial systems as nutrients was proposed by Oparin (1953 
[1924]). Deamer (1999) wrote: “It seems likely that primitive cells incorporated 
lipid-like molecules from the environment as a nutrient, rather than undertaking the 
much more complex process of synthesizing complex lipids by an enzyme-­catalyzed 
process.”3
The emergence of self-reproducing CLMs could be facilitated by interaction of 
organic molecules with non-organic ions or crystals. Organic molecules produced 
by primordial systems were initially very simple, and simple molecules are not 
likely to act as strong catalysts. This limitation can be removed, however, if these 
small molecules acquired or modified their catalytic competence via interaction 
with non-organic ions or crystals. For example, amino acids readily interact with 
heavy metals such as cobalt, nickel, or zinc, and some of these complexes are

catalysts (Dutta et  al., 2014); vanadium has effects in carbohydrate metabolism 
(Gruzewska et  al., 2014), whereas iron and sulfur facilitate electron transfer 
(Kummerle et al., 2000). Oxidation of hydrocarbons can be facilitated by iron oxide. 
These inorganic compounds are natural contaminants in petroleum (i.e., biogenic 
oil), and thus it is reasonable to assume that they may be also present in abiogenic 
oil droplets.
Oil droplets with CLMs represent a two-level hierarchical system that includes 
self-reproduction at both levels: (1) level of catalytically active surface molecules 
and (2) level of oil droplets populated by communities of surface-bound molecules. 
Moreover, CLMs support self-reproduction at both levels because they change their 
local environment (i.e., surface properties of oil droplets) and this change enables 
them to capture resources, self-reproduce, and propagate to other oil droplets 
(Fig. 5.4). As a result, CLMs play the role of hereditary signs (i.e., coding mole-
cules) because they encode the surface properties of oil droplets (phenotype) and 
transfer the code to the next generation of colonized droplets in the form of addi-
tional copies of the same molecule kind (Sharov, 2009). Because of their self-­
reproduction capacity, oil droplets with a specific surface community of CLMs are 
higher-level agents that interpret CLMs as hereditary signs. This, then, may have 
been the beginning of biosemiosis (or of any semiosis whatsoever).
Besides oil droplets, CLMs can also colonize mineral surfaces (Wächtershäuser, 
1988); though minerals cannot be used as a source of carbon. Wächtershäuser 
assumed that CO2 was the source of carbon for the synthesis of organic molecules. 
However, carbon fixation from CO2 was hardly possible at the early stages of the 
origin of life (see Sect. 5.4). Thus, mineral surfaces could harbor primordial net-
works of self-reproducing organic molecules only if minerals were covered with a 
film of oil. Such primordial networks could spread along mineral surfaces, and then 
possibly be transported on oil droplets to colonize other patches of oleophylic min-
erals. Thus, mineral surfaces and oil droplets could have been two complementary 
niches for one and the same population of self-reproducing CLMs.
5.6  Diversification of Molecular Communities
The major criterion of progress in biological evolution at its largest scale is the 
increase of functional complexity (Sharov, 2006). Thus, the increase in the number 
of components and relations in molecular communities is the main path towards 
full-fledged organisms. The core of the primordial self-reproducing system is a 
minimal subset of irreplaceable coding components and coding relations. If any of 
these components or relations is lost entirely, then it cannot be recovered based on 
other components and relations. Establishment of new coding molecules depends 
on their capacity to self-reproduce as well as on their compatibility with already 
existing molecules. If new molecules strongly compete with other components for 
resources, then the self-reproduction capacity of the whole system may be 
compromised.
5  Origins of Life

135
The first path for the emergence of new coding molecules is de-novo acquisition, 
similar to the emergence of the first self-reproducing CLMs. Such acquisition can 
be facilitated by the coalescence of droplets carrying different coding molecules. 
Consider that some population of oil droplets has coding molecules of type a, and 
another partially separated population has coding molecules of type b. If droplets 
from different populations coalesce, they make a new kind of droplets with two 
types of coding molecules: a and b (Fig. 5.5a). If the new droplet splits up due to 
mechanical agitation, then the progeny droplets are likely to carry both kinds of 
coding molecules, because multiple copies of each are present in the parental sys-
tem. Thus, combinations of coding molecules can be inherited and make their own 
evolutionary lineages (Sharov, 2009). If the combination (a + b) is beneficial, then 
droplets with both coding molecules would reproduce faster than droplets with just 
one kind of coding molecules.
Initially, coding molecules were not connected and were transferred to offspring 
systems in different combinations at random. The probability of transferring the full 
set of coding molecules to descendants by pure chance may be problematic, espe-
cially if droplets carry too many kinds of coding molecules and some of them are 
present in a small number of copies. This combinatorial problem can be partially 
meliorated by the “stochastic corrector” mechanism, which is a preferential propa-
gation of systems with a full set of coding molecules (Szathmáry, 1999). Systems 
with an incomplete set of coding molecules are more likely to fail in surviving and 
reproduction because some of their functions appear missing. This kind of stochas-
tic correction is a primordial version of the purifying selection; and like the purify-
ing selection, it reduces the overall reproduction rate of the population.
An important consequence of the emergence of new kinds of coding molecules 
is the diversification of the downstream molecules. For example, if coding molecule 
A generates some products from available resources, then catalytic activities of the 
additional coding molecule B can be applied to the products of molecule A. Similarly, 
catalytic activities of A can be applied to the products of B. Thus, the increase of the 
number of coding molecules results in a much faster combinatorial increase in the 
Fig. 5.5  Emergence of new coding molecules. (a) Coalescence of oil droplets carrying different 
self-reproducing coenzymes. (b) Phosphorylation of molecule a, which is stably produced within 
the chemical community on the surface of oil droplets, results in the emergence of a new coding

reproducing molecules a. (Modified from Sharov, 2016)
5.6  Diversification of Molecular Communities

136
diversity of downstream molecules. This diversity could in turn increase the chances 
of acquiring new coding molecules through paths discussed below.
The second path towards the emergence of new kinds of coding molecules is the 
modification of existing coding and downstream molecules (Fig. 5.5b). It is impor-
tant that new coding molecules facilitate their self-reproduction. For example, if 
molecules of type a are already produced in the systems and the phosphorylated 
modification of a (i.e., ap) facilitates the phosphorylation of a, then a single phos-
phorylated molecule aP initiates a chain reaction that converts a into ap. This reac-
tion may initially be harmful due to a decrease in the number of molecules a, and 
weakening of functions supported by a. However, the molecular community may 
eventually develop protecting mechanisms such as shielding some molecules a 
from phosphorylation or inhibiting the catalytic activity of ap if it becomes too 
abundant. As a result, the system acquires a new kind of coding molecules ap, which 
can self-reproduce and support a new chemical function (i.e., phosphorylation). 
This molecule is heritable because the descendant systems are likely to get copies 
of ap after the division of oil droplets.
Finally, the third path towards the emergence of new coding molecules is the 
establishment of novel relations, such as polymerization (Sharov, 2009). Polymers 
may initially emerge as downstream products of non-polymeric coding molecules. 
For example, if a coding molecule a can catalyze the polymerization of molecules 
b, then it encodes the formation of long polymers b-b-b-b-... (Fig. 5.5c), which may 
function for example to stabilize the surface of oil droplets.
5.7  Evolutionary Potential
Long-term coexistence of multiple kinds of coding molecules on the surface of the 
same oil droplet inevitably leads to their cooperation, out of necessity. The term 
“cooperation” in evolutionary biology has two aspects. In the short term, it means 
that two agents interact, and this interaction is mutually beneficial in terms of 
increasing the rates of their reproduction, as exemplified by the hypercycle (Eigen 
& Schuster, 1979). The long term criterion of cooperation is coadaptation that leads 
to stronger interaction along the evolutionary time scale. But is it possible to talk 
about coadaptation in the evolution of simple molecules, such as coenzymes? We 
cannot expect that coding molecules easily change their chemical structure and 
keep their competence for self-reproduction. Thus, instead of looking for changes in 
the chemical structure of coding molecules, we consider changes in relations 
between molecules or changes in their local environment. By relations we mean 
weak or transient interactions that do not cause irreversible change in the molecule 
structure, as in catalysis. Relations can be also mediated by modification of local 
environments (e.g., surface properties of oil droplets). Potential relations between 
even simple molecules are can be diverse: two molecules may turn and approach 
each other from different sides, or interact via intermediate molecules that serve as 
signals or resources. There are many more potential cooperative relations as 
5  Origins of Life

137
compared to the number of potential structural modifications of a single molecule. 
These relations may become heritable signs if they reinforce each other. Thus, 
heredity can be supported not only by coding molecules but also by coding relations 
between molecules, and in fact by the whole network of relations. Note that the 
autopoiesis theory always emphasized the self-renewal of relations in addition to 
the self-­renewal of components (Maturana & Varela, 1980).
An important condition for primordial life is the capacity to evolve adaptively 
towards more complex functional molecules and pathways. Self-reproduction of a 
single kind of molecules (e.g., autocatalysis or crystal growth) is not sufficient for 
evolution, because in this case the set of alternative ways to reproduce is limited. 
Without heritable variation there is no Darwinian selection and no adaptive evolu-
tion. In rare cases, crystallization may follow multiple alternative pathways that 
provide a limited potential for change (Cairns-Smith, 1982). But the number of 
variations is always small and not sufficient for supporting long-term evolution. We 
believe that the evolutionary potential of primordial systems can be increased by 
cooperation between different kinds of CLMs. Thus, oil droplets likely harbored a 
community of self-reproducing molecules with cooperative and possibly conflicting 
relations.
Among all kinds of relations between molecules, the relations mediated by the 
local environment (e.g., by the surface properties of oil droplet or abundance of 
resources) seem most important in the context of evolution. Each kind of self-­
reproducing CLMs performs some function, such as capturing resources, storing 
energy, or catalyzing a reaction; and these effects may have been beneficial not only 
for this particular kind of molecules but also for other kinds of self-reproducing 
CLMs on the same oil droplet. If these beneficial effects are reciprocal and increase 
the rate of self-reproduction of the entire molecular community, then we can say 
that the involved molecules have a cooperative relation. The main advantage of 
molecular cooperation compared to modification of single molecules is in the 
increase of potential variability of outcomes. Modification of oil droplets is an 
example of “niche construction”, and was necessary for boosting the evolutionary 
potential of primordial systems. In summary, the evolvability of primordial molecu-
lar communities could have been supported by subtle changes such as modification 
of the local environment and cooperative relations between species of organic 
molecules.
5.8  Emergence of Template-Based Replication
The main factor that restricted the rate of primordial evolution was the absence of 
universal methods for producing new hereditary molecules. Transformation of such 
molecules via change of functional groups or polymerization enhanced the evolv-
ability to some extent. But the radical solution of this problem came only with the 
invention of template-based (or digital) replication. Replication can be viewed as a 
special case of autocatalysis applied to hetero-polymers, where each monomer is

added to the newly-constructed polymer sequentially based on a uniform simple 
rule applied to each monomer in another linearly aligned polymer that serves as a 
template (Szathmáry, 1999). Digital replication is universal in the sense that the rule 
of replication works for polymers of various lengths and for any sequence of mono-
mers from the allowed set. Using the terminology of Kauffman (2014), we can say 
that the invention of digital replication provided “enabling constraints” that 
expanded the boundaries of the heritable “adjacent possible”, and in this way, 
increased the evolutionary potential of life.
The origin of template-based replication may have happened as follows. 
Presumably, hetero-polymeric coding molecules with repetitive or partially random 
sequence already existed in primordial systems but their sequence was not con-
served at a single monomer resolution. It is possible that the frequency (or large-­
scale patterns) of monomer types was preserved approximately. Such polymers may 
initially stick to each other side by side on the surface of oil droplets to perform 
some function (e.g., increase mechanical stiffness of the surface or facilitate reac-
tions). If polymers have overhanging ends, then the shorter strand in a paired 
sequence can become elongated by adding monomers that weakly matched the lon-
ger strand (Fig. 5.6a). Natural selection may have supported the increase of fidelity 
of this process, which helped to produce better copies of existing polymers. 
Template-based replication probably started with copying short repeats (e.g., 
telomere-­like), and then progressed into copying longer repeats and entirely aperi-
odic sequences (Sharov, 2009) (Fig. 5.6b). First replicating polymers were probably 
similar to nucleic acids; however, the sugar-phosphate backbone of RNA does not 
support anchoring to the oil surface. In contrast, peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) with 
a pseudopeptide backbone are able to absorb at the lipid-water surface (Weronski 
et al., 2007). Thus, PNA-like molecules could have been evolutionary predecessors 
of RNA (Nelson et al., 2000). The emergence of digital replication was the turning 
point in the origin of life that substantially increased the evolutionary potential of 
primordial living systems (Jablonka & Szathmáry, 1995; Sharov, 2009).

5.9  Transition from Surface Metabolism 
to Membrane-Bound Cells
The evolution of primordial metabolism on the surface of oil droplets eventually 
reached a point of saturation because of two constraints: a limited supply of oil in 
the environment, and the two-dimensional surface of oil droplets. Although surface 
metabolism provides advantages during the emergence of life, its drawback is the 
limited capacity of the two-dimensional surface to store resources for the primordial 
agency. Also, the mobility of polymers in a two-dimensional space could be 
restricted, because long molecules cannot easily pass each other on a surface.
To overcome these limitations, primordial systems presumably transformed oil 
droplets into an outer membrane via engulfing water (Fig. 5.7). Agitation of oil 
emulsion in water easily makes nested droplets, but they are unstable. Cell-like 
organization is unlikely to yield any functional advantage if the membrane breaks 
easily. The membrane has to be strong enough to sustain mechanical disturbances, 
and osmoregulation is needed to prevent bursting. Membranes can be stabilized by 
replacing fatty acids with lipids, and especially, phospholipids. Lipids require glyc-
erol, which has to be synthesized within the system because it is not available in the 
environment. Thus, the emergence of metabolic pathways for glycerol synthesis 
was necessary for making stable membranes. An additional function of glycerol 
could have been making sugars that are suitable for storing energy, regulating osmo-
sis, and for making nucleic acids. It is not clear whether template-based replication 
of coding polymers appeared before or after the formation of a stable cell mem-
brane. But in any case, a combination of these two evolutionary events could have 
produced membrane bound cells with ribozyme-based catalysis that match the 
RNA-world model (Gilbert, 1986).

5.10  From the RNA World to Prokaryote Cells
As the number of coding molecules increased in evolution, the stochastic correction 
mechanism became less effective in keeping all coding components together. A sto-
chastic corrector has a significant fitness load because daughter cells with an incom-
plete set of coding molecules are not fully viable. This load increased with each 
additional type of coding molecules, which limited the increase in overall complex-
ity of the system. In addition, the stochastic correction mechanism requires abun-
dant copies of each type of coding molecules, so that at least one copy is transferred 
to each daughter cell. As a result, cells had to spend valuable resources for making 
redundant copies of coding molecules. These problems were resolved in evolution 
by concatenating heterogeneous coding molecules (e.g., RNAs) into one larger unit 
(e.g., a chromosome) and by developing mechanisms of controlled chromosome 
transfer to descendent cells.
Protein synthesis (translation) presumably emerged as a modified type of self-­
replication (Root-Bernstein & Root-Bernstein, 2015). Apparently, peptides existed 
before ribosomes and were synthesized individually by specific ribozymes. Because 
the first peptides were likely short and included only a few kinds of amino acids, 
their functional capacities were limited. According to Root-Bernstein and Root-­
Bernstein, the evolutionary fate of peptides changed when they were used to assist 
the self-replication of RNA. As a result, natural selection supported not only self-­
replication of the RNA itself, but also the production of helper peptides. In particu-
lar, peptides became longer and included a more specific sequence of amino acids. 
The diversity of animoacids increased in evolution. Particularly important was the 
emergence of amino acids that are currently found in catalytically active portions of 
proteins: lysine, cysteine, serine, threonine, aspartate, histidine, and tyrosine 
(Holliday et  al., 2009). The first four of them are rather simple and probably 
appeared earlier in evolution that the latter three. The evolution of peptide-assisted 
RNA replication also included the emergence of efficient catalysis of peptide bond 
formation and tRNA for transporting amino acids. This hypothesis is supported by 
the fact that the ribosomal RNA of bacteria Escherichia coli carries remnants of the 
entire set of tRNAs for all amino acids together with fragments of coding sequences 
for ribosomal proteins, polymerases, ligases, synthetases, and phosphatases (Root-­
Bernstein & Root-Bernstein, 2015). Thus, ribosomal RNA apparently originated 
from a genome that encoded a self-organizing and self-replicating network of 
molecules.
The correspondence between the triplets of nucleotides in the RNA molecule and 
corresponding amino acids in the encoded protein is determined by the genetic 
code. Although the genetic code we know today is nearly universal in all living 
organisms, it is not likely to have appeared initially in its current form. It is possible 
that the initial genetic code was based on nucleotide doublets rather than triplets, 
and encoded a smaller set of amino acid types (Patel, 2005; Travers, 2006). It is also 
likely that genetic code gradually evolved towards lower rates of translation errors 
(Novozhilov et al., 2007).
5  Origins of Life

141
Reconstructions of the Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA) of all known 
living organisms (Doolittle, 2000; Theobald, 2010) indicate that LUCA was far 
more complex than the RNA-world systems described above. The hypothetical 
LUCA had a DNA-based genome and fully developed machinery for programmed 
synthesis of proteins. The integrity of the DNA was maintained by a group of diverse 
enzymes, including DNA helicase, topoisomerase, ligase, and DNA repair proteins. 
The RNA-polymerase complex was used to synthesize mRNA copies of each gene. 
LUCA-type cells synthesized fatty acids, and thus were no longer dependent on the 
supply of abiotic oil. The outer membrane of LUCA included ion pumps, receptors, 
and other proteins. Although the genome of LUCA is a product of phylogenetic 
reconstruction, it can be viewed as a bacteria- or Archaea-like organism with a num-
ber of genes in the range from 500 to 1000 (Koonin, 2003, 2009). The difference in 
complexity between early cells with the first encoded proteins and LUCA-­type cells 
is hard to overestimate – it is comparable in scope to the difference between pro-
karyotes and multicellular eukaryotes.
5.11  The Age of Life
Most biologists believe that life originated on Earth almost immediately after its 
formation in the young Solar system. The earliest reliable traces of life are dated 
from 3.77 to 4.28 billion years ago (Dodd et al., 2017), and some researchers argue 
that the hypothetical LUCA must have originated nearly 4.5 billion years ago (Betts 
et al., 2018). An alternative hypothesis, known as panspermia, assumes that life is 
widespread in the Universe and can be transferred physically between planets and 
even between star systems within a galaxy. The possibility that life is present on 
many planets is indirectly supported by the discovery of bacterial life in bare envi-
ronments on Earth, such as the deep earth crust or Antarctic lakes under thick ice 
sheets (Robinson & Mikucki, 2018).
One of the authors of this book has used genome complexity as an evolutionary 
clock to estimate the age of life (Sharov, 2006). A reliable measure of genome com-
plexity has been proposed by Adami et  al. (2000), who suggested counting the 
length of non-redundant and functional DNA in the genome. In contrast, the total 
amount of DNA in a cell is not a reliable measure of genome complexity, because 
some single-cell organisms have more DNA by several orders of magnitude than 
human cells, a phenomenon known as the C-value paradox (Patrushev & Minkevich, 
2008). However, the length of nonredundant and informationally functional DNA is 
generally higher in evolutionary advanced lineages (e.g., animals) than in primitive 
unicellular organisms.
Some segments of DNA are involved in non-informational functions, such as the 
structural support of the nuclear matrix and nuclear lamina, chromosome condensa-
tion, regulation of cell division and homologous recombination, and the mainte-
nance and regulation of telomeres and centromeres (Cavalier-Smith, 2005; Rollins 
et al., 2006). These segments are mostly repetitive or random and not conserved, so 
5.11  The Age of Life

142
there is no reason to consider their contribution to genome complexity. By func-
tional DNA, we mean conserved sequences, which encompass the majority of 
genes, and regulatory modules such as promoters and enhancers (Kellis et al., 2014). 
Regulatory regions in mammalian genomes are less stable than genes, and not 
always highly conserved. An additional criterion of functionality in this context is 
the absence or strong depletion of transposable repeats (Simons et al., 2006). Based 
on Sharov’s estimate, about 15% of the mammalian genome is transposon-free, and 
therefore likely functional (Sharov, 2006).
If genome complexity of major phylogenetic lineages is plotted on a logarithmic 
scale against the time of their origin, the data points fit well to a straight line (Sharov, 
2006) (Fig. 5.8). This indicates that genome complexity has increased exponen-
tially, and doubled about every 340 million years (Sharov & Gordon, 2018). Similar 
estimates (360 million years) were obtained independently by Markov et al. (Markov 
et al., 2010). Such a relationship reminds us of the exponential increase of computer 
complexity, expressed as “Moore’s law” (Moore, 1965). Moore’s law is drawn from 
empirical observations and states that the number of transistors in integrated com-
puter chips doubles every 18–24 months. This is much shorter than the doubling 
time of genome complexity, but then tendency is similar.
Seen in context, the two examples give rise to a question: What do computers and 
living organisms have in common, given that complexity measures for both of them 
follow an exponential curve? First, the evolution of human technology is in a sense 
similar to biological evolution because both processes are driven by goal-seeking 
agents, such as humans and other organisms (Sinnott, 1962). Second, both pro-
cesses involve learning via trial and error, since natural selection is functionally 
similar to learning (Hoffmeyer, 2011: 48). Finally, both biological evolution and 
advances in computer technology are driven by positive feedback factors. In the 
case of genome evolution, existing genes help new genes to become established via 
gene duplication, cooperation, and providing functional niches for new genes. In the

case of technology, computers help to design and build more powerful computers, 
so that the more advanced one “generation” of computers are, the more advanced 
the next generation can become.
The relationship between genome complexity and the time of origin of organ-
isms can be extrapolated back in time to the origin of life, when genome log-­
complexity was zero, about 9.7 billion years ago (Fig. 5.8) (Sharov, 2006; Sharov & 
Gordon, 2018). This point corresponds to a primordial system with just one heredi-
tary sign, which must have been a CLM rather than a nucleotide (because nucleo-
tides are not catalysts and the origin of life requires catalysis).
Among the data used for regression, the two earliest points are the most uncer-
tain, and therefore make a major contribution to the variability of regression-based 
predictions. A sensitivity analysis that assumes variations of the two earliest points 
in the range of ±0.3 billion years and ±0.3 log10 bp genome length gives a range for 
the regression of ca. ±2 billion years (Sharov, 2006). If this model is correct, it is 
unlikely that life originated on Earth, since the age of Earth is only 4.5 billion years.
Marzban et al. (2014) have reanalyzed the regression data shown in Fig. 5.8 
using a new statistical approach where the measurement error is predicted based on 
a model that assumes a uniform frequency distribution of errors at all data points 
(Buonaccorsi, 2010). Their result indicates that the confidence interval of the age of 
life included 4.3 billion years, which implies that it is possible that life is not older 
than Earth. However, the assumption of the measurement error model (i.e., uniform 
frequency distribution of errors) does not apply to our data, because some data 
points (the more recent ones) are much more accurate than others. For this reason, 
the application of equation (9) in (Marzban et al., 2014) is not justified.
If ancestors of extant life on Earth originated before the existence of the Earth 
and Solar system, then we have to acknowledge that some primitive organisms must 
have been transferred to Earth or to the protoplanetary disk early in the evolution of 
the Solar system (Wallis & Wickramasinghe, 2004). Bacterial spores have unusu-
ally high survival rates even in very harsh conditions, and are therefore likely can-
didates for interstellar transfer. Rocks or water containing bacteria might be ejected 
into space from a planet via collision with comets or asteroids (Ehrlich & Newman, 
2009). Then bacterial spores may remain alive in a deep-frozen state for a time that 
may be sufficient for interstellar transfer to a new environment. On Earth, bacterial 
spores have been reported to have been revived after 25–35 million years of dor-
mancy (Lambert et al., 1998). The survival of active bacteria during cosmic travel 
between planets is an attractive hypothesis because active bacteria are able to repair 
their DNA and withstand the damaging effect of radiation (Johnson et al., 2007). In 
comparison, dormant spores cannot repair their DNA, and therefore DNA damage 
can only accumulate during long-distance travel. Testing of this hypothesis is cur-
rently not possible because it would require extensive analysis of soil or water sam-
ples from multiple planets in the Solar system and beyond.
It has been discussed whether bacterial spores and living bacteria can travel 
inside rogue planets or comets (i.e., planets and comets that do not orbit any star) for 
long distances (Abbot & Switzer, 2011; Badescu, 2011) and possibly give rise to 
life on new planets in neighboring star systems (Sharov & Gordon, 2018). The 
5.11  The Age of Life

144
hypothesis of panspermia may appear more plausible if it is proven that the Solar 
System originated from the remnants of an exploded parental star (Joseph, 2009). If 
the Earth incorporated some of the planet fragments from such a parental system, it 
might have been seeded by a diverse community of bacterial species and their 
viruses.
Regardless of how life emerged on Earth, it is conceivable that the age of life 
exceeds the age of planet Earth, since life might first have emerged on Earth-like 
planets in star systems that are billions of years older than our Solar system.

Conceptualizing Agency
Abstract  Here we present a systematic analysis of the phenomenon of semiotic 
agency: a capacity for acting purposefully and using signs to make informed 
choices. Semiotic agents have an extended ontological status because their exis-
tence depends on past purposeful activity of their own and/or ancestral agents, and 
also supports future purposeful activities. Semiotic agents exercise autonomy by 
making choices and having a degree of independence from the environment. The 
main aspects of autonomy are autopoiesis, self-governing, and semiotic freedom, 
which entail capacities for self-maintenance, self-control, and creative interpreta-
tion of signs, respectively. Some goal-directedness is present in all agents, even if it 
is not internally recognized by the agent itself. Goals are signs that motivate or initi-
ate agent activity; they can emerge via evolution or learning, or get programmed by 
parental agents or higher-level agents. Agents have different modes of individua-
tion, which refers to their separation from and interaction with the environment and 
other agents. All agents are produced by parental agents of similar (or higher) com-
plexity level. Agents can be classified into primary, self-reproducing agents, and 
secondary agents that are produced by primary agents and perform some of their 
functions. We reject the notion that semiotic agency is incompatible with mecha-
nisms. Lower-level agential functions are performed by mechanistic subagents, 
such as ribosomes in living cells.
6.1  Agency and Its Ontological Status
Agency is an empirical notion, and it is therefore not practically possible to formu-
late an exhaustive definition. Based on a sample of definitions summarized in 
Table  6.1, we find that the most notable feature of agency is teleology (end-­
directedness or goal-directedness). Sharov (2016) and Tønnessen (2015) point to 
autonomy (spontaneity, self-governing, and choice of action), whereas Tønnessen 
(ibid.) and Kockelman (2017) also include the semiotic capacity of agents in their 
definitions. Although these three features are different, they are strongly interdepen-
dent. Teleology needs semiosis because (i) goals are signs interpreted by agents, and 

154
(ii) goal-directed activities require such sign processes as memory and perception, 
because to achieve goals agents need to remember (or inherit) their habits and to 
monitor their own state and/or the state of the environment. Neither teleology nor 
semiosis is possible without autonomy.
One of the challenges to overcome is the common belief that the notion of agency 
is non-scientific. Agency, intentionality, and consciousness are by some scholars 
considered as illusions of folk psychology that are incompatible with science 
(Dennett, 1991: 304). Scientists’ frustration with the notion of agency is under-
standable, since history is full of examples of thinkers mistakenly populating the 
world with ‘agents’ that were not there. Religions and myths assumed the existence 
of spirits, gods, or fabulous creatures to ‘explain’ unknown phenomena. The long 
period in human history of blind belief in natural and supernatural agents was fol-
lowed by a categorical rejection of agency that has been encouraged in science by 
the success of Newton’s physics and the evolutionary theory of Darwin, which both 
deemphasize the role of natural agents. Newton’s models of motion rely to the uni-
versal laws of nature, which cannot account for agent-specific processes, such as 
heredity, evolution, phenomenal experience, and learning. Similarly, the theory of 
natural selection and especially its later version known as neo-Darwinism, use over-
simplified models of reality. One of the assumptions of neo-Darwinism is that 
heredity is based solely on DNA copying, which is considered a passive process 
involving random errors. Although neo-Darwinistic models may successfully pre-
dict the outcome of some laboratory experiments (Lenski & Travisano, 1994), they 
mostly fail to explain or account for the evolution of species in nature (Pigliucci & 
Müller, 2010).
Recent trends in science indicate a shift of interest from mechanism towards 
autonomous self-organizing processes that are typical for living organisms, their 
components, multi-organism communities, and the interaction of organisms with 
technical devices (Henning & Scarfe, 2009). We believe the time has come to bring 
the notion of agency back into science. In our endeavor we follow a conservative 
approach by using three restrictive heuristics. First, we limit agents to things that are

accessible for experiments, and have traditionally been explored by science, such as 
organisms, their parts, functionally integrated groups of organisms, and autono-
mous artifacts. Second, we do not explain agency by any hypothesized substances 
or forces other than those already known in modern natural science, social sciences 
and the humanities. And third, we do not link agency with unproven, speculative 
physical effects on organisms such as subatomic quantum factors, extra dimensions 
in space, string theory, or multiverse theory.
With these restrictions in mind, a natural question is why we need the notion of 
agency if the phenomena we aim to explain are already studied in biology in mecha-
nistic terms? Dennett rejects agency and consciousness for the reason, which he 
characterizes as user illusion (Dennett, 1991: 311–312). A user illusion means the 
illusion of a computer user that thinks she can move the cursor on the screen or 
move files from one location to another, whereas in fact all these operations are 
performed by computation. Following this logic, Dennett argues that consciousness 
is an illusion because it can be reduced to a “virtual machine, realized in the astro-
nomically adjustable connections of a human brain” (ibid: 431). Dennett’s criticism 
of the notion of agency (aiming to avoid a user illusion) leads to yet another more 
serious illusion: the illusion that the brain can be fully understood by mechanistic 
methods, such as isolating its parts and testing them.
Our approach is incompatible with the philosophy of Dennett; not because his 
theory refers to mechanisms, but because it does not go beyond mechanisms and 
cannot account for higher-level phenomena that include agency, teleology, auton-
omy, and consciousness. A simple agent can depend on biochemical (or silicon) 
mechanisms, but this does not make it into a zombie. The organization of an agent, 
even if it is mechanistic, is grounded in history, which is either evolutionary history, 
as in the case of a ribosome, or the history of human civilization and technology, as 
in the case of a robot. No agent, not even a mechanistic agent, is reducible to its 
parts, because the interactions and relations between parts (and with the environ-
ment) are products of past evolution and learning, and can yield unpredictable emer-
gent future effects. The evolution of agency is an open-ended process, and 
occasionally generates genuine novelties. Biosemiotics is not alone in holding these 
positions. But in contrast to cybernetics, autopoiesis, and enactivism, biosemiotics 
assumes the semiotic nature of agency (Hoffmeyer, 2008a, b; Sharov et al., 2015). 
The goals of semiotic agents are historically formed modules of sign-dependent 
preferences (interpretations) that are coherent with the functional organization of an 
agent, its maintenance, and reproduction.
The notion of semiotic agency also departs from the anthropocentric view of 
Descartes, who recognized agential capacities only in the human species. Cartesian 
dualism defends the autonomy of the human soul by postulating its categorical sep-
aration from the human body. This separation allows theorizing on the properties of 
the soul drawing on abstract axioms and pure reason. In contract, our theory consid-
ers embodiment as one of the constituent factors of organism autonomy. Agents are 
always embodied in some respect. We assume that human cognition is a natural 
phenomenon that is grounded in evolutionary history and neurophysiology. 
Following the Umwelt theory of von Uexküll (1957: 74–76), we assert that 
6.1  Agency and Its Ontological Status

organisms with different bodies, senses, effector organs, and nervous systems per-
ceive and utilize the same environment in different ways. There is no universal 
Platonic world that may be accessed by all organisms (or, indeed, by humans only) 
in order to make sense of the objects around them. Instead, all ideas and mental 
representations of objects are products of individual minds embodied in differently 
configured sentient bodies. Individual minds are subjective and never fully identical 
to other minds. Besides perception, animals also differ in their utilization of objects 
and therefore rely on different sets of object properties. Despite all these differ-
ences, the mental worlds of related animals (e.g., animals in the same species) dis-
play systematic similarities because of their common heritable development and 
behavior, and their common environment, and also due to intraspecific imitation and 
communication.
The ontological status of agents is rather complex. First, many agents are self-­
maintained processes rather than static things. For example, just like tornados or 
fires, organisms persist in a far-from-equilibrium state which is enabled by a con-
stant supply of energy. And second, agents, in contrast to tornados and fires, change 
their far-from-equilibrium state by modulating the flow of energy and enabling 
descendent agents to repeat the same changes later on. As a result, the trajectory of 
agents’ far-from-equilibrium state typically become internally stabilized, or in other 
words, become inherited as a habit or innate goal-directedness. Heritable habits 
have a tendency to evolve towards supporting the survival and reproduction of the 
carrier agent via natural selection (see Chap. 8 for details). In this way habits become 
more adaptive, they can therefore be called purposeful. Habits do not necessarily 
serve the organism’s selfish interests because agents are organized hierarchically 
and some habits are beneficial for a higher-level agent, such as the group, colony, or 
evolutionary lineage. Such habits can arise in the process of kin selection or group 
selection (c.f. discussion by Lloyd, 2020).
The capacity to develop and preserve purposeful habits is a fundamental prop-
erty of all self-reproducing agents. This creates a self-supporting and self-­developing 
feedback loop between an agent and its purposes: The existence of an agent is sup-
ported by purposeful agential activity, which in turn is supported by the agents’ 
existence. Thus, agents exist not only as they are, but also as being guided by the 
purposeful habits of their ancestors and their own. In other words, the existence of 
agents is purposeful, where purposes can be internal, as in organisms, and/or exter-
nal, as in cell subagents and human artifacts. Internal purposes make the ontology 
of organisms dynamic, because organisms change the way they exist when pursuing 
their purposes. For example, humans often reshape their lives by pursuing certain 
goals; and in a more general sense (not necessarily self-reflectively), any living 
agent does the same.
We consider agents as having an extended ontological status because their exis-
tence is conditioned by the purposeful activity of their ancestors (including parental 
agents) and their own purposeful activity. A similar idea has been expressed by 
Denis Walsh (2018: 182): “What organisms do is quite unlike what any other natu-
ral entities do. Organisms constitute a distinct ontological category. They are a spe-
cial kind of processual thing; they are agents.” Walsh believes that the special 
6  Conceptualizing Agency

157
ontological status of agency is grounded in the processual nature of agents. We 
agree that processes can be assigned a special ontological status, to distinguish them 
from static things. But not all processes are agential. Geysers and flames, for 
instance, are processes but not agents, since they are not goal-directed and lack a 
functional and evolutionary feedback loop between their existence and their pur-
poses. As these examples demonstrate, the ontological status of agents is extended 
further beyond the ontological status of processes.
Such an extended ontological status is not only a property of self-reproducing 
agents, but also a feature of dependent agents (e.g., humans’ autonomous artifacts) 
and subagents. Subagents are produced by higher-level agents for the purpose of 
outsourcing some of their functions to these subagents. For example, ribosomes, 
which are protein-producing subagents, are generated by cells (higher-level agents 
relative to ribosomes) in order to supply all cell components with the necessary 
proteins. Here, ribosomes exist because of the purposeful activity of their parental 
agents (cells) and because of their own activity. In contrast to the widespread view 
of a ribosome as a deterministic automaton, ribosomes are in fact context-dependent 
semiotic agents. For example, it interprets inosine in mRNA in a context-dependent 
way, resulting in re-coding or translational stalling (Licht et al., 2019). Furthermore, 
nonsense-mediated decay of mRNA depends on the context in which a stop codon 
is found in mRNA (Kurosaki & Maquat, 2016). Context-dependency has also been 
found in some protein receptors attached to the cell membrane (Lam et al., 2019).
The purposeful existence of agents supplies them with a kind of temporality 
which is unique to agents. Anything that is physical but non-agential also has a his-
tory, but only agents use their history and temporality as resources for functioning 
and further development. In short, agents keep a memory of the past to inform their 
momentary operation while positioning themselves with regard to anticipated future 
functioning. This kind of temporality can be called temporal thickness, using the 
term coined by Alfred Whitehead (1920: 56):
Simultaneity is the property of a group of natural elements which in some sense are compo-
nents of a duration. A duration can be all nature present as the immediate fact posited by 
sense-awareness. A duration retains within itself the passage of nature. There are within it 
antecedents and consequents which are also durations which may be the complete specious 
presents of quicker consciousnesses. In other words a duration retains temporal thickness.
The term ‘temporal thickness’ has been applied mostly to psychology and per-
ception. For example, Ginsburg and Jablonka (2019: 235) used it as one of the cri-
teria of consciousness. We prefer to expand its meaning by applying the term to all 
agents, because temporal thickness results from connecting traces of the past expe-
riences of agents (e.g., genes, memories, and habits) with their goals in the future. 
Even a simple externally programmed agent such as a thermostat displays temporal 
thickness, by keeping the past target temperature setting in its memory and applying 
it for differentiating the current ambient conditions into ‘hot’ and ‘cold’ categories 
in order to keep future temperatures close to the target (following its imprinted 
goal). The notion of agency with extended ontological status has the potential to 
transform science and philosophy in the long run.

6.2  Autonomy
Autonomy is a necessary, organizing feature of all semiotic agents. It involves self-­
sufficiency, self-government, and some level of independence from the environ-
ment. Agents are material, but thanks to their autonomy they have certain powers 
over material processes (both internal and external). Autonomy is always incom-
plete, because agents require external resources and rely on interaction with other 
agents. Some agents are more autonomous that others. Higher levels of autonomy 
are seen e.g. in autotrophic organisms that use only inorganic resources and energy, 
and thus are able colonizing bare rocks or disturbed habitats. These include many 
species of bacteria, archaea, and some plants. Most animals are heterotrophic 
because they consume other organisms or products of their activity (e.g., fallen 
leaves decomposed by bacteria and fungi) to get organic resources. Resource-wise, 
heterotrophic organisms are less autonomous than autotrophic ones. However, ani-
mals are much more autonomous than plants in their movement and behavior. The 
least autonomous organisms are parasitic species in all taxonomic groups because 
they are confined to the body of a host organism, which is used both as food and 
habitat. As we readily see, autonomy is a complex phenomenon with multiple com-
ponents. Here we will focus on three components: autopoiesis, self-governing, and 
semiotic freedom.
6.2.1  Autopoiesis
As defined by Humberto Maturana and Francisco Varela (1980: 112–113), autopoi-
esis refers to the self-sustainability of organisms in terms of self-repair and homeo-
stasis: “a living system is defined as a system by the concatenation of processes of 
production of components that generate the processes that produce them and consti-
tute the system as a unity in the physical space”. This represents a contemporary 
version of the Kantian concept of organisms as wholes, where “every part is recipro-
cally purpose, [end] and means” (Kant, 1914 [1790]: 204). It is also similar to sev-
eral other theoretical constructs proposed independently: metabolism-repair system 
(M,R) (Rosen, 1972), autocatalytic set theory (Kauffman, 1971, 1986), and the che-
moton model (Gánti, 2003 [1971]) (Fig. 5.1). An autopoietic system is productively 
and operationally closed, each component is produced and operated by some other 
component(s) of the system, and these processes support the integrity and identity 
of the whole unit. Varela described this feature as “operational closure”, where 
“organisms are fundamentally a process of constitution of an identity” (Varela, 
1997: 73–74).
Self-renewal and reproduction are applied not only to components but also to the 
organization of the whole that includes relations and interactions between compo-
nents. However, the self-reproduction of organisms is secondary to autopoiesis, and 
as such “it cannot enter as a defining feature of the organization of living systems” 
6  Conceptualizing Agency

159
(Maturana & Varela, 1980: 100). Living systems are organized hierarchically, but 
the autopoietic closure is distinct at each level, a feature which prevents the reduc-
tion of higher level units to the processes at lower levels. Finally, living systems are 
integrated with their ecological niche, and a niche cannot be defined independently 
of a living system that forms it.
The autopoiesis theory emerged in opposition to cognitivism, which relied on the 
computer metaphor of mind and saw cognition as implementation of deductive log-
ics. Maturana and Varela chose to avoid cybernetic and teleological notions such as 
information, representation, sign, goal, purpose, and function. Instead they tried to 
describe life and cognition mechanistically as physical self-support and self-­
production (Maturana & Varela, 1980: 78–79):
Autopoietic machine is a machine organized (defined as a unity) as a network of processes 
of production (transformation and destruction) of components that produces the compo-
nents which: (i) through their interactions and transformations continuously regenerate and 
realize the network of processes (relations) that produced them; and (ii) constitute it (the 
machine) as a concrete unity in the space in which they (the components) exist by specify-
ing the topological domain of its realization as such a network.
Unexpectedly, Maturana and Varela decided to use the term “cognition” despite 
of its cybernetic, semiotic, and teleological connotations. Moreover, they assume 
that cognition is coextensive with life and autopoiesis: “Living systems are cogni-
tive systems, and living as a process is a process of cognition. This statement is valid 
for all organisms, with and without a nervous system” (Maturana & Varela, 1980: 
13). We do not share this view, and reserve the notion of cognition for agents with 
advanced semiotic capacities such as representational perception and learning (see 
discussion in Chaps. 4 and 8).
Autopoiesis is an important feature of all organisms that ensures self-­maintenance 
and self-repair (Barandiaran, 2017; Maturana & Varela, 1980). It can support self-­
reproduction by supplying necessary cell components, although self-reproduction is 
not a universal feature of organisms because it is absent e.g. in worker bees and 
many hybrids (e.g., mules). However, we do not agree with the radical idea of 
Maturana and Varela that autopoiesis does not come in grades: “[t]he establishment 
of an autopoietic system cannot be a gradual process; either a system is an autopoi-
etic system or it is not” (Maturana & Varela, 1980: 94). In contrast, we assume that 
autopoiesis is often incomplete because many molecular components of organisms 
(e.g., amino acids or vitamins) are not synthesized internally but acquired from the 
environment or through food. Maturana and Varela attempted to fix the problem of 
incompleteness by assuming that an organism is integrated with its niche into a 
single autopoietic system. They postulated that “autopoietic machines have no 
inputs or outputs”, and yet indicated that “they can be perturbated by independent 
events” (ibid: 81). We agree that an organism’s niche is an important factor for 
agency, although it is not tightly integrated with the organism, and in many cases it 
is dispensable when animals move away from a primary habitat and use resources 
elsewhere. But the incorporation of the niche does not ensure a full autopoietic clo-
sure, because the components of the niche, in contrast to cell components, are not 
6.2  Autonomy

160
produced internally. Full autopoietic closure is therefore neither possible nor neces-
sary for organisms.
A substantial number of agents are not autopoietic. For example, most subagents 
of a cell (e.g., ribosomes, endosomes, and functional protein complexes) are allo-
poietic, which means that they are constructed and repaired by other agents. Some 
of these subagents have a limited capacity for self-repair after damage, but most 
often damaged subagents are destroyed. For example, defective ribosomes are 
tagged for degradation and then destroyed via autophagy (Mathis et al., 2017). All 
technological autonomous agents (robots) are allopoietic, and in this respect similar 
to ribosomes. In conclusion, autopoiesis is typical for a special type of autonomy 
rather than a universal feature of all agents.
6.2.2  Self-Governing
Self-governing is the capacity of agents to choose, execute, and regulate their 
actions in a goal-directed way. The self-governing of organisms may include auto-
poiesis, but it is more than that. Autopoiesis is a process that preserves the status 
quo, and is most relevant for describing cell metabolism and homeostasis. In addi-
tion to that, self-governing is also needed to control the changes of an organism 
(e.g., development, physiology, and behavior) and its niche construction. 
Autonomous human artifacts such as robots, may also require elements of 
self-governing.
We can attribute actions to an agency for three reasons. First, the embodied orga-
nization of an agent is the major factor that shapes the pattern of activities. 
Environmental factors can induce or modulate behaviors (e.g., as signs or con-
straints) but they cannot change the main pattern of activity that is determined by 
the agent itself. Second, most agents (e.g., organisms) anticipate external distur-
bances and develop tools for neutralizing or adapting to them. And third, most 
agents manage energy that is required for their activity. Organisms acquire energy 
either from organic material or inorganic sources (e.g., solar radiation or soil chemi-
cals). Intracellular subagents are supplied by energy-rich ATP molecules. Human 
autonomous artifacts either acquire energy from organic or inorganic sources or use 
energy supply generated by humans elsewhere.
Because of self-governing, the actions of organisms are often described as spon-
taneous (i.e., having no external cause) or induced (e.g., as habits). In the latter case, 
the timing of action depends on an external signal or disturbance, but the type of 
activity that is chosen has internal causes. Ginsburg and Jablonka (2019: 278) wrote 
that: “Constant spontaneous and induced activity [...] is a hallmark of life”. The 
notions of spontaneity and induction, however, do not imply goal directedness, and 
thus, they are not equivalent to self-governing, which is always goal-directed. 
Spontaneous and induced changes also occur in non-agential systems such as gey-
sers, hydrothermal vents, cloud formation, and lightening.
6  Conceptualizing Agency

161
How do we know if an agent is self-governed? Most humans have personal expe-
rience of setting goals and then choosing actions to reach these goals. We can also 
observe that the behavior of other people is generally consistent with the hypothesis 
of self-governed activity. To prove that their activity is indeed self-governed we can 
ask them if their actions were intended and planned. According to people responses, 
the majority of human actions are indeed self-governed. The existence of unin-
tended or uncontrolled actions (e.g., Parkinson tremors or sleep walking) does not 
contradict to the notion of self-governed behavior; it only limits its extent. This kind 
of reasoning, however, was considered non-scientific in behaviorism because inter-
nal mental states are not directly observable. Behaviorism overall ignored self-­
governing and focused the research on the external causes of animal action (Skinner, 
1938). Contemporary behavioral science has left the doctrine of behaviorism behind 
and uses modeling to explore the behavioral effects of hypothetical mental states 
(Turner, 2017: 1–2). The task of detecting self-governing in animals is more diffi-
cult because animals cannot talk as humans do, though they obviously communicate 
by other means. It is possible to infer some animal intentions and habits based on 
the “argument from analogy” (Romanes, 1883) as well as from shared associations 
between objective physiological states and subjective mental states (Morgan, 1903).
Self-governing is often understood narrowly as cognitive control of animal 
behavior. However, we assume that the notion of self-governing should also be 
applied to non-behavioral activities of organisms, such as metabolism, growth, dif-
ferentiation, and embryo development. Such an understanding of self-governing 
can be seamlessly extended to organisms without brains and a nervous system, such 
as simple animals, plants, fungi, protists, and bacteria. Their organization supports 
such activities as metabolism, growth, and differentiation; and these activities are 
regulated by specific signaling networks. Primitive organisms initiate actions auto-
matically in response to internal or external signals, but the pattern of activity is 
grounded in the evolved organization acquired in evolution (e.g., in innate habits). 
In this case, the choice of activity has been made somewhere in the history of the 
lineage and then assumed the form of a heritable habit. In summary, we think that 
self-governing is a feature of all semiotic agents.
The actions of organisms depend on a hierarchy of resources, tools, and scaffolds 
which needs to be generated beforehand. Obviously, not every use of these resources, 
tools, and scaffolds is intentional. Some actions may be accidental in some respect 
(e.g., via misinterpreted sign, malfunction, or failure). But the interdependency of 
functions can be used as an operational criterion for self-governing. For example, 
animal appendages appear in early stages of embryo development but become fully 
functional only after birth; thus, developmental choices made by cells and organs in 
the embryo support the running patterns of the adult animal. If several organs have 
developed in evolution to work together (e.g., bones, muscles, nerves, blood 
6.2  Autonomy

162
vessels), then their cooperative activity is likely to be goal-directed and actively 
chosen at some stage.1
The self-governing capacity of agents has been questioned because of its poten-
tial incompatibility with the principle of causality, which asserts that every event 
has a prior cause or a set of causes. Kant formulated this principle as follows: 
“Everything that happens (begins to be) presupposes something which it follows in 
accordance with a rule” (Kant, 1998 [1781]: 304). This principle is a useful heuris-
tic in many practical tasks ranging from finding a bug in a computer program to the 
analysis of criminal justice cases. But it is not helpful in the analysis of reaction-­
diffusion molecular systems, where small fluctuations in the local abundance of 
certain molecules become amplified into dissipative structures with highly hetero-
geneous spatial patterns. In this example, new spatial patterns emerge, starting from 
a uniform molecule distribution without any clearly identifiable cause. The principle 
of causality becomes non-operational due to the exponential increase in the num-
bers of prior causes. Assuming that molecules in an organism collide 1 billion times 
per second,2 the number of prior causes (chains of collisions) in 10 s will reach 1090, 
which exceeds the number of atoms in the Universe. According to Kauffman (2014), 
the overwhelming majority of potential configurations even of a simple protein mol-
ecule never happened in the history of the universe, which implies that probabilities 
of molecular events cannot be reliably measured due to their uniqueness (for details, 
see Sect. 1.2).
Searching for potential physical causes of human actions is not feasible, since 
we will never be able to record membrane potentials simultaneously in all the 100 
billion neurons and 1 quadrillion of synapses in the human brain. The causality 
principle should therefore be seen as a research tool with a limited range of useful 
applications. Here we assume that self-governing of agents does exist as a phenom-
enon and does not contradict known physical laws, as pointed out by Wiley (1994). 
Elements of self-governing exist in macro-molecular mechanisms such as ribo-
somes or functional protein complexes. These mechanisms are not deterministic, 
since they make errors and can stop functioning unpredictably. In contrast to physi-
cal phenomena such as e.g. geysers and lightening, molecular subagents are con-
structed by a higher-level agent (cell) to perform specific functions, and have a 
goal-directedness that is imprinted by their parental agents. Merely physical phe-
nomena do not display any similar purposeful goal-directedness, though they serve 
physical functions related to e.g. rebalancing flows of matter and energy.
The notion of self-governing is occasionally discussed under other names. For 
example, Barandiaran et al. (2009: 3) called it “interactional asymmetry” and char-
acterized as follows: “an agent is a source of activity, not merely a passive sufferer”. 
The authors compared agential causation with physical causation and found that 
1 The criterion of interdependency of functions can be applied only to relatively complex agents 
with a large number of functions. Proving self-government in simple agents with few functions 
may be more problematic.
2 For comparison, the number of collisions of a water molecule is about 1014 per second (Feynman 
et al., 2015).

they do not match well in a deterministic and statistical sense. To characterize inter-
actional asymmetry in agents, Barandiaran et al. used the term modulation, which is 
defined as a set of conditions and constraints that affect the dynamics aimed at a 
particular outcome. It is exemplified by the interaction of a diver with the rock sub-
strate that constraints his/her movement during the jump into the water. The authors 
define agency via three interrelated aspects: individuality, interactional asymmetry, 
and normativity.
6.2.3  Semiotic Freedom
Biosemiotics explains the phenomenon of autonomy by assuming that there is an 
extra layer of reality over physical processes, and this layer is of a semiotic nature 
and involves sign processes. As we argued above, it is meaningless to search for the 
initial physical cause of a human action. Instead, biosemiotics is focused on the 
emergence of biological meaning in living processes. For example, when a molecu-
lar receptor causes a signal cascade in a cell, this process appears meaningful 
because it is anticipated and recognized by cell components. We consider it as 
meaning because a weak initial signal is amplified at the cellular level and then, 
through cell interaction, is used to control a goal-directed body action. The process 
is semiotic because the organism interprets things and processes as signs, and selec-
tively uses these signs to regulate living functions. Organism functions have emerged 
via previous long-term adaptive changes such as evolution and/or learning. These 
changes occur at a different time scale than immediate physical causation. Semiosis 
creates temporal thickness by connecting different time scales, specifically, the 
immediate responses of the organism are interrelated with past evolutionary or cog-
nitive changes. When we study agents, long-term semiotic causes appear to be of 
greater importance than short-term physical processes. As Hoffmeyer (1992: 120) 
wrote: “The study of causal links should always be guided by the understanding of 
semiotic links, not vice versa.”
Let us use an example to discuss the semiotic nature of autonomy: a driver stops 
at a red light because she interprets the red light as a signal to stop. When the light 
changes to green, the driver starts moving because the green light is a signal to do 
so. According to the theory of Charles Peirce, the red light is a sign vehicle, the 
object is the status at the road intersection, where the traffic moves across the road, 
and the interpretant is the intention of a driver to stop followed by pushing down the 
brakes. Reference to the object explains why a particular interpretant is selected for 
the sign vehicle. We can also say that the red light stands for traffic movement 
across the road, and the driver interprets it by stopping. There is no physical deter-
minism in the response of the driver; instead there is a semiotic choice of action.
The semiotic aspect of autonomy is related to what is known as semiotic free-
dom, a notion introduced independently by Jesper Hoffmeyer and Norbert Wiley. 
Hoffmeyer defined it as “the depth of meaning that an individual or species is capa-
ble of communicating” (Hoffmeyer, 1992: 109). Wiley described it as a fusion of 
6.2  Autonomy

164
interpretation, determination, and freedom: “the action itself, which may flow from 
the interpretation, can be viewed as determined. [...] But the freedom is still there, 
back a step, in the creative act of interpretation” (Wiley, 1994: 15). Semiotic free-
dom requires methods of interpretation that associate incoming signs with interpre-
tants. All actions are executed via such methods, and we consider them as essential 
components of autonomy. However, it is a common mistake to assume that interpre-
tation methods are always conscious and rational. To overcome this confusion, 
Hoffmeyer (1992) suggested that there is no reason to reject a notion of unconscious 
interpretations. He wrote: “Even if the decision is first unconscious, why not to see 
it as a personal choice based on previous life experiences and on the highly personal 
but mostly unconscious calculation devices in the brain?” (ibid: 114). Interpretation 
and semiotic freedom can therefore be expanded further: to the human body and to 
all living systems.3 It is well known that animals and plants can choose their actions 
(i.e., growth and development for plants and movement for animals) based on 
demand and affordances. Nervous system can facilitate the choice of actions in 
animals, but it is not a necessary component for any capacity for choosing actions. 
Even single-cell amoeba and infusoria make choices by differentiating between 
edible and non-edible particles (Xinyao et al., 2006).
Due to semiotic freedom, autonomous agents are neither deterministic nor sto-
chastic. The probability of an animal appearing in a certain environment is uncer-
tain, because agents can choose their environment, and make choices related to 
movement. Moreover, in each environment, an animal can organize its behavior 
around different stimuli depending on its physiological needs and available 
resources. A rough approximation of animal behavior would be a set of rules or 
context-dependent preferences that specify likely responses to various external 
signs. Some actions can be interrupted due to a change in priorities. Despite of 
uncertainty, the growth, development, and behavior of agents is predictable to some 
extent on condition that we know their capacities and goals. For example, the rules 
for the egg laying behavior of a monarch butterfly are generally known (Jones & 
Agrawal, 2019). A female monarch lays eggs on the leaves of certain species of 
milkweed, which are acceptable as food for baby caterpillars that will emerge from 
the eggs. These species are recognized by the texture and volatile chemicals of 
leaves. Butterflies have complex perception capacities for detecting the smell and 
texture of leaves, as well as features of the habitat. Before laying an egg, a female 
fertilizes it using sperm stored in a spermatheca since copulation. Then an egg is 
glued to the surface of a fresh milkweed leaf. Behavioral choices of monarch 
females are mostly automated, although it is possible that behaviors are improved 
via learning. Despite of its complexity, the egg laying behavior is mostly successful 
in the natural habitats of monarchs.
Semiotic freedom implies a capacity of agents to receive sensorial inputs (i.e., 
signs) and use interpretation methods to process these inputs. For example, animals 
use various external senses (e.g., vision, hearing, smell, taste, and touch) as well as 
3 Hoffmeyer (1996: 64) seems to attribute semiotic freedom only to cognitive levels of semiosis.
6  Conceptualizing Agency

165
internal senses (pain and proprioreception) to select and modify their actions. 
Primitive informed choices can be found even in the activity of functional molecular 
complexes inside living cells. For example, with the help of tRNA adapters, a ribo-
some “reads” the linear sequence of nucleotides in the messenger RNA (mRNA) 
molecule and interprets each triplet of nucleotides as instruction to append a spe-
cific amino acid at the end of the synthesized protein molecule. Then the ribosome 
shifts the mRNA molecule by 3 nucleotides and adds another amino acid encoded 
by the next triplet (Lodish et  al., 2000). The semiotic function of biomolecular 
mechanisms in cells include interpretation of chemical signals as prompts to start, 
stop, or modify their activity, and production of other chemical signals that affect 
various subagents within a cell.
Biosemiotics equates semiosis, and a degree of semiotic freedom, with life 
(Anderson et al., 1984). The notion of life has historically mostly been applied to 
whole organisms. In addition, biologists agree that cells within multicellular organ-
isms are alive too. But there is no consensus on whether parts of a cell, such as 
mitochondria, ribosomes, chromosomes, and functional protein complexes are alive 
in their own right. Some biosemioticians assume that cells are minimal semiotic 
agents (Bruni, 2008: 367). This view is consistent with the practice in biochemistry, 
where cell parts are assumed to be non-living, and are regarded as reagents. It is not 
that important for practical purposes whether parts of cells are called alive or not; 
but there is no doubt that cell components are autonomous semiotic agents whose 
functions are essential for life. This idea can be further extended to human autono-
mous artifacts. It is certainly against our intuition to say that computers and robots 
are alive, and in a biological sense they are not, but they are autonomous agents that 
take care of some human functions and, in this respect, they are functionally similar 
to ribosomes and functional proteins in a living cell. This reasoning shows the 
advantage of using the notion of ‘agency’.
The ability of agents to develop new interpretation methods and change existing 
ones comprises a second-order semiotic freedom that represents an additional 
aspect of autonomy, namely semiogenesis, which is discussed in Chap. 8. This abil-
ity is realized via learning-like processes on varying levels of complexity. The sim-
plest one is heritable variation combined with natural selection, which exists in all 
species.
Another advantage of the agency-centric approach is its capacity to explain 
behavioral autonomy and cognition in organisms. There is no need to infer the exis-
tence of a homunculus to explain cognition. Instead, the cognition of an organism is 
the result of integration of semiotic processes in a hierarchy of autonomous sub-
agents. There is currently no consensus on the definition of cognition (or conscious-
ness). Here we assume that the crucial component of cognition is learning, which is 
the development of new mental representations of reality or rearrangement of exist-
ing representations.
Humans have reached advanced levels of semiotic freedom as compared to ani-
mals, due to the development of symbolic language, logic, and culture, among other 
things. Naturally, these capacities did not emerge from nothing, and some animal 
species (especially apes) display elements of symbolic communication, logic, and 
6.2  Autonomy

166
culture (Parker & Gibson, 1990; Sebeok & Umiker-Sebeok, 1980). Nevertheless, 
human cognitive competence is generally higher, and is being actively facilitated by 
sophisticated educational methods. Additional layers of humans’ semiotic freedom 
have emerged with the development of technology in general, and most recently, 
computers and related technology. The semiotic freedom of humans has a strong 
social component. Humans have reached high levels of social integration and col-
laborate in complex ways. This allows us to speak about cultures as superorganisms 
(Kesebir, 2012). Social interactions have a double effect on the individual: on one 
hand, they limit individual autonomy by adding constraints and responsibilities, but 
on the other hand, they open up new domains of semiotic freedom. For detailed 
analysis of individual and social human agency, see Chap. 3.
6.3  Goal-Directedness
The goal-directedness or normativity of agents can be defined as involving “goals or 
norms according to which they [agents] are acting” (Barandiaran et  al., 2009). 
Cognitive animals anticipate the results of their actions, and this anticipation serves 
as a motivation for selecting an action. They have mental representations of their 
goals, and can select appropriate habits or actions for reaching them. In contrast, the 
goals of simple agents such as bacteria are instantiated by sign-dependent prefer-
ences and constraints on their activities that have no representational links with 
empirical reality. Von Uexküll (1957: 42) applied teleology in the sense of goal-­
directedness only to animals that are capable of planning their actions via represen-
tational thinking. He did not attribute goals to a sea urchin, earthworm or tick 
because their behavior follows instincts which are “nature’s plan” rather than the 
“subject’s goal”. Here we disagree with von Uexküll, because goal-directedness is 
a more fundamental feature of agents than representational thinking, and we apply 
the notion of goal to all agents, including earthworms, ticks, bacteria, and even 
robots.4
Goals may emerge internally within agents (e.g., via learning); but they can be 
also programmed externally. For example, the heritable goal-directed behavior of 
organisms is programmed genetically (and epigenetically) by ancestors. External 
programming of goals is also typical for robotic devices (Cariani, 1998, 2011). A 
self-guided missile is programmed to classify objects into targets and non-targets 
and then to follow the target. Agents with externally-programmed goals can support 
a given static set of functions in agents, but they lack adaptability and thus may not 
be able to function properly in a changed environment.
Organisms have specific sets of goals at each level of their organization: molecu-
lar, cellular, tissue-specific, behavioral, and social. Goals at the molecular level 
4 In robots, major goals are programmed externally, whereas lower level goals can be generated 
autonomously.

167
include keeping physiological concentrations of metabolic resources (e.g., amino 
acids, glucose, ATP) and various kinds of proteins, maintaining chromosome integ-
rity, and modifying the cytoskeleton. Examples of cell goals are cell division, dif-
ferentiation, and performing cell-type specific functions: contraction for muscle 
cells, signaling for neural cells, and so on. Goals of the whole organism include 
eating, digestion, excretion, sensing, movement, mating, and reproduction. Finally, 
there are goals at the level of super-organisms (e.g., families, populations, species, 
and ecosystems) related to what is beneficial for them. Examples of the goals of a 
colony are communication of information about food (e.g., bee dances), construc-
tion of nests, defense (e.g., by soldier ants), and establishment of new colonies.
Humans widely use language and logic as tools for setting goals and making 
goal-directed activity more efficient. It makes sense to evaluate the meaning of 
statements (propositions) based on their practical value. This idea belongs to Charles 
Peirce, who developed the concept of pragmatism, or pragmaticism, as a part of his 
semiotic doctrine (Peirce, 1998 [1893–1913]: EP1.132). In particular, he suggested 
that true statements are valuable in human practice, whereas false statements are 
not. William James (1907) followed the ideas of Peirce but modified the concept of 
pragmatism by applying it to a much wider set of statements including those that 
cannot be verified experimentally, such as claims of the existence of god or beliefs 
in the beneficial effect of certain habits. Peirce dismissed such statements as meta-
physical, but acknowledged that some non-testable statements can be true based on 
logic alone. For example, we cannot check if a diamond is hard if it is broken, but it 
is true that the diamond was hard before it broke.
James’s pragmatism appears to be a very powerful heuristic because many 
human beliefs are not verifiable, but may still help to achieve certain goals. The faith 
in a god often supports a happy and meaningful life, no matter if the god exists or 
not. Similarly, some pharmaceutical drugs may bring benefits to patients, no matter 
if the proposed molecular mechanism of their action is true or false.5 James’s prag-
matism does not imply that true knowledge is not needed. Instead, it shows that the 
practical value of actions is not reduced to the logical value (i.e., true or false) of 
statements that support them. Thus, it makes sense to evaluate the practical value of 
an agent’s activity even if the mechanism of its effect remains unknown.
Goals belong to the category of “meaningful things” or “signs” (see Chap. 7). 
Only those signs serve as goals that motivate (or initiate) actions that are expected 
to bring benefits to the agent in question. The benefits of actions may be objective, 
if they support survival and reproduction of organisms, or subjective, if they bring 
emotional or other bodily satisfaction (pleasure). Let’s consider examples of goals 
in simple living systems such as a bacterial cell. Bacteria do not perceive their goals, 
but the goals exist in the form of innate habits acquired phylogenetically and 
encoded in the genome. For example, the goal to sustain basic metabolic processes 
in the cell is supported by the specific pattern of nucleotides in the promoter called

unintentional effects as well, e.g., a placebo effect.

a Pribnow box; it has 6 nucleotides TATAAT and is located approximately 10 base 
pairs upstream of the transcription start. This sign activates the expression of all 
genes that are not repressed, and it is interpreted by the RNA-polymerase protein 
complex, which recognizes the promoter pattern, binds to it, and activates transcrip-
tion (Saecker et al., 2011). Besides that, other genomic signs are necessary to sup-
port basic metabolic processes.
In general, the bacterial goal-supporting system can be described as an event-­
processing machine, where goals emerge in response to signals and are followed by 
relevant actions. The topology of the signaling network is mostly fixed by the 
genome, and the state of cells depends mostly on the current conditions. But bacte-
rial activities can be adjusted by habituation and sensitization based on memory of 
past conditions (Casadesus & D’Ari, 2002).
Eukaryotic cells have more complex goal-supporting signaling systems than pro-
karyotes. Their signal-processing pathways include more nodes and generally more 
robust and reliable than similar pathways in bacteria. Besides these quantitative 
differences, eukaryotic cells have a qualitatively more sophisticated long-term epi-
genetic memory than bacteria. They thus carry extensive non-genetic information 
and transmit it through cell divisions to the progeny cells. Epigenetic memory 
enables cells to remodel their regulatory networks autonomously even if the genome 
and immediate environment does not change. An example of such autonomous 
change is the differentiation of cells during the embryo development of animals. 
Even more advanced goal-supporting signaling can be found in the nervous system 
and brain of animals (see Chap. 4 for details). Animal goals can be positive (attrac-
tors) or negative (repulsors) and are often linked with emotions (e.g., desire, drive, 
aggression). An example of a repulsive motivation is a hunger state that an animal 
attempts to escape by using memory traces of past food-finding experiences 
(Ginsburg & Jablonka, 2019: 375). In cognitive animals, goals become integrated 
into a representational cognitive network, where representational mental states 
inform the animal “about what to do, in what manner, and toward what end” 
(ibid: 377).
In humans, goal-making has become the core of individual and social activity. A 
human life without goals is considered to be wasted. Human goals often become 
associated with emotions which can be positive or negative. Thanks to language 
communication and cultural integrity, humans have access to a lot of possible goal-­
directed strategies that were implemented by people in the past. There is plenty of 
choice, and one needs to employ certain navigation strategies to explore relevant 
goals. Humans are social beings, and therefore individual goals need to be inte-
grated with the social environment. Some people decide to change their social envi-
ronment to be better able to follow their individual goals in life.

6.4  Individuation
Individuation (or individuality) is a reflexive process of self-representation where 
individual features and components become attributed to agent’s self either con-
sciously or unconsciously. Individuation provides a semiotic integration of agent 
parts and defines a functional boundary/interface with the environment. Most exist-
ing theories consider psychological aspects of human individuation. Carl Jung 
described individuation as bringing the personal and collective unconscious into the 
conscious. He wrote “The aim of individuation is nothing less than to divest the self 
of the false wrappings of the persona on the one hand, and of the suggestive power 
of primordial images on the other” (Jung, 1967: par. 269). Gilbert Simondon devel-
oped a dynamic psycho-biological theory where individuation is a process of actu-
alization of initial potentials (Scott, 2014). In this perspective, an individual is never 
complete because there is always a path towards other unrealized potentials. 
According to Simondon, individuation resembles the growth of a crystal in terms of 
propagation in a space of possibilities.
Biological aspects of individuation are more diverse than psychological ones. 
Multicellular organisms face the problem of morphogenesis: developing a continu-
ous sequence of forms starting from an egg and ending with a fully-functional adult 
stage, where each intermediate form is functional and viable, and the transition 
between adjacent forms is realized by tools and processes (affordances) available at 
each time. A biological individual is therefore represented not simply by the final 
form but also by a continuous life cycle from egg to adult (Oyama et al., 2001).
The trajectory of morphogenesis is not fixed but becomes actualized in the con-
text of a local environment. Depending on the availability of resources, organisms 
may acquire local “accidental individuality” (Jonas, 1966: 80). Jonas used this 
example to emphasize the importance of form in life:
In fact, instead of saying that the living form is a region of transit for matter, it would be 
truer to say that the material contents in their succession are phases of transit for the self-­
continuation of the form (ibid: 80).
Individuation exists even in cases where individuals are not fully separated and 
appear functionally integrated. For example, we could ask whether conjoined twins 
(Fig. 6.1) represent a single organism or a pair of individuals. Gunnarson (2010: 
128) argued that because conjoined twins have separate brains (i.e., controlling 
organs) both of them are individuals. Gunnarson also claims that individuation can 
be preserved even in cases of stronger integration of twins, such as involving one 
head with two brains, or one brain stem (vegetative control) and separated cerebral 
cortices that control mental functions (ibid: 129–130). In our view, there are multi-
ple levels of individuation of varying strength. A pair of conjoined twins represents 
both a single super-agent organism and two lower-level subagents with each their 
individual human agency.
The example of conjoined twins shows that individuals may not be sole “owners 
“of their body. Instead, they have a joint ownership of shared parts of the body. 
Special coordination between the two minds of conjoined twins may be needed to 
6.4  Individuation

control the movement of shared legs. Similar sharing of bodies or their parts can be 
found in many other organisms, too. For example, a cell infected by a virus shares 
its ribosomes with the virus. A plant infected by aphids (sucking insects) shares 
some of its tissues (e.g., portions of leaves or stems), and aphids transform these 
tissues into a gall.
In hierarchically organized agents, individuation occurs at multiple levels. For, 
example cells in a multicellular organism have their own identity and developmen-
tal fate, whereas the identity of the whole organism includes its embryo develop-
ment, movement, behavior, and reproduction. Most organs in the body have partially 
autonomous regulation, and thus have their own individuation levels. For example, 
the heart has regular beats that are induced locally by the action potential generated 
in the sinoatrium node. An interesting example of organ autonomy is described by 
von Uexküll (1957: 32):
An external organ that contains a complete reflex arc is aptly termed a reflex person. Sea 
urchins possess a large number of such reflex persons, each of which performs its own 
reflex function by itself, without central control. To illustrate the contrast between animals 
built in this way and higher animals, I have coined the phrase: when a dog runs, the animal 
moves its legs; when the sea urchin runs, the legs move the animal.
Social species have at least two kinds of individuation: as separate organisms and 
as social units. The latter unity can be achieved via smells, acoustic signals, or facial 
recognition. Humans have multiple social identities related to their family, national-
ity, education, profession, and employment, etc. Joint production activities may

171
result in creation of joint property (e.g., house, publications, or patents). Social 
individuation can be established without a special controlling organ (i.e., a social 
brain) because individual brains can handle equally well both individual tasks and 
social functions. Thus, a lower-level agent can be employed by a higher-level social 
agency to perform social management functions.
Individuation also requires establishment of dynamical interaction between an 
organism and its environment, and the nature of interaction depends on the living 
strategy. In particular, plants and animals build their interaction with their environ-
ment on different principles. A plant is fully embedded in the soil environment that 
nourishes it, whereas “for the animal the relevant items of its environment are 
always at a distance” (Jonas, 1966: 104). A plant is continuously merged with its 
environment, while an animal defines and experiences a “split between self and 
world” (ibid.). The importance of separation of agents from the environment was 
emphasized by other scholars. Maturana and Varela (1980: 87) connected the notion 
of individuality with autopoietic closure. In this view, an autopoietic unity becomes 
stable due to its capacity to produce all its components including the membrane. 
Hoffmeyer emphasized the importance of the formation of a cell membrane at the 
origin of life, as a boundary and interface separating the inside from the outside 
(Hoffmeyer, 1998). Barandiaran et  al. (2009: 3–4) wrote that the asymmetry 
between an agent and its environment is not enough, any agency needs to distin-
guish itself from the outside: “the first condition for the appearance of agency is the 
presence of a system capable of defining its own identity as an individual and thus 
distinguishing itself from its surroundings; in doing so, it defines an environment in 
which it carries out its actions”.
Does this mean that all agents need a boundary? A membrane boundary is cer-
tainly beneficial for living cells, but in general, there are also alternative solutions 
for keeping components together. Molecules can be connected via covalent bonds 
(e.g., amino acids in a protein), hydrogen bonds (nucleic acids), electric charge, 
hydrophobicity, and matching 3-D shapes (binding of proteins to each other or to 
DNA). Organs are connected via adhesion and connective tissue. Epithelial cover in 
animals and plants does not function as a boundary to keep internal components 
together; instead, it functions mostly as a protective barrier to prevent desiccation, 
damage, and infection. Finally, multi-organism agents such as ant colonies do not 
have a distinct physical boundary (for the super-organism) and yet keep their integ-
rity via complex behavioral patterns and mutual recognition. Thus, generalizations 
about the universal role of boundaries in agents (Barandiaran et al., 2009; Hoffmeyer, 
1998) are exaggerated.6
Barandiaran et al. (2009) claim that agents always define their identity by distin-
guishing the inside components from the outside. Our view is that the criteria for 
individuation are different for simple protosemiotic agents and for more complex 
eusemiotic agents. Simple agents, such as bacteria, do not “know” of the existence 
6 Philosophers sometimes refer to non-physical boundaries, such as cultural or ethnical boundaries 
(see Harrison, 1999). However, Hoffmeyer and Barandiaran et al. seem to have meant physical 
boundaries, such as cell membranes.

of the outside world, since they receive no sensorial input besides individual signals 
generated by protein receptors in the membrane. In comparison, sentient animals 
access external objects by using various sensory channels which may include e.g. 
vision, sound, smell, taste, and touch, and each of these channels allows for recogni-
tion of complex spatial and/or temporal patterns. Such animals distinguish between 
the inside and outside and keep accumulating information and models about them-
selves and their environment.
6.5  Agents from Agents
One of the fundamental features of agents is that they never emerge spontaneously 
(except for very simple primordial agents at the origin of life); instead they are 
always constructed by some other agents, considered as parental agents (Sharov, 
2010). Agents are therefore interconnected into potentially infinite lineages of 
recursive construction. Clonal organisms (e.g., bacteria or rotifera) produce nearly 
identical progeny which later become parents of the next generation of clonal organ-
isms. This kind of recursive construction creates infinitely branching lineages that 
do not merge (Fig. 6.2a). In other cases, construction requires the coordinated activ-
ity of multiple parental agents (e.g., a male and female), which makes intersecting 
agential lineages (Fig. 6.2b). Lineage bundles of sexually-reproducing organisms 
are relatively homogeneous because the differences between sexes are usually small 
and limited to a few traits.
Only a few intra-cellular subagents make distinct lineages. These include chro-
mosomes, mitochondria, and plastids. In contrast to lineages of organisms, the lin-
eages of cell subagents require substantial help from other cell subagents. For 
example, chromosomes cannot divide without DNA polymerase and many other

173
enzymes that regulate DNA copying, chromatin remodeling and cell division. 
Mitochondria and plastids have their own genome, which is however small, and 
encodes only a small portion of their proteins. Lineages of mitochondria therefore 
have limited autonomy.
Most cell components are constructed by other kinds of subagents (Fig. 6.2c). 
The construction of proteins requires cooperative actions between RNA polymerase 
proteins, specific genes in the nucleus, and ribosomes: genes are used as templates 
to make complementary mRNA copies (transcripts), which are then exported to the 
cytoplasm and utilized by ribosomes as programs for protein synthesis. Then newly-­
constructed proteins contribute to the production of new ribosomes in two path-
ways: ribosomal proteins serve as building blocks of ribosomes; and RNA 
polymerase makes ribosomal RNA (rRNA) molecules, which then become self-­
assembled into ribosomes together with ribosomal proteins.
The rule that agents are always produced by other agents is also applicable to 
subagents of organisms. For example, new cells in multicellular organisms (e.g., 
animals and plants) always emerge via division of parental cells of the same kind. A 
multicellular organism includes a few hundred cell types specialized in various 
functions, and cells of the same type usually form clusters called tissues. Tissues are 
subagents of a multicellular organism, and originate from embryonic tissues during 
embryo development. Embryonic tissues are thus parental agents for differentiated 
tissues. In their turn, embryonic tissues originate from basic embryonic layers 
known as ectoderm, endoderm, and mesoderm, respectively. Furthermore, all cells 
of basic embryonic layers are descendants of a single fertilized egg, which is the 
“root” of the entire multicellular organism.
Parental agents cannot have a substantially lower functional complexity than 
descendent agents (Sharov, 2006). This means that functional complexity cannot 
increase rapidly in a sequence of generations. The reason why the functional com-
plexity of agents does not increase rapidly is that long evolutionary times are 
required to develop each new function via trail and error and facilitated by natural 
selection. Simultaneous and fast emergence of multiple novel functions is therefore 
impossible. This rule is an informational equivalent of the gradualism principle in 
the theory of evolution (Sharov, 2009b). If an agent is produced by two (or more) 
parental agents, then the total non-redundant complexity of the parental agents com-
bined is counted as a benchmark for the produced agent. The principle of gradual-
ism does not contradict the existence of emergent behaviors, which is an important 
property of life (Weber, 2009). It only restricts the rate of emergence by stating that 
new functions do not appear instantly but emerge gradually via modification of 
already existing functions. The origin of life does not contradict the principle of 
gradualism, either, because primordial agents were extremely simple and presum-
ably had only a few functions (Sharov, 2009a).
When assessing the functional complexity of organisms, it is important to 
account for potential functions, which can be generated by an agent without sub-
stantial learning or evolution. The progeny organism is produced as a subagent of its 
parent and then becomes separated in the form of an egg or a neonate. Therefore, it 
is substantially smaller than the parent and often does not carry many of the parental 
6.5  Agents from Agents

174
functions.7 However, it has a potential to develop all these missing functions later in 
the life cycle, and thus the total functional complexity is not lost in the process of 
reproduction.
The production of artificial agents by humans also satisfies the principle of grad-
ualism because humans equipped with technological tools have a higher level of 
functional complexity than any human-made device.8 The majority of human-made 
artificial subagents are assembled from parts by humans equipped with tools and 
robots, but some require elements of self-organization. For example, satellites are 
often unfolded and re-assemble in space after launch. Self-organization is also a 
common approach that is utilized in nanotechnology and in the production of syn-
thetic organisms.
Because agents do not emerge by chance, they persist in the world thanks to the 
continuous production by other agents. All agents are artifacts in the sense that they 
are manufactured by other agents, which means that “life is artifact making” 
(Barbieri, 2008). The world of agents is closed by the production relation, and in 
this way separated from the world of physical objects. The separation of agents 
from non-agents (i.e., physical objects) in some respect resembles the rejected idea 
of Cartesian dualism, and it is therefore important to formulate the differences 
between these two views. First, Cartesian dualism is about substances: the mind/
soul is opposed to the body/matter. In contrast, agents and non-agents are both 
material, but agents have an extended ontological status because of their goal-­
directedness, autonomy, and semiosis, which means that there is an extra dimension 
to their existence. Second, Cartesian dualism assumes no well-supported transition 
or evolution that connects the mind/soul with the body/matter. In our narrative, 
agents have originated from the physical world and evolved towards progressively 
stronger and more complex agential features. This corresponds to “the increase in 
semiotic freedom” that is observable in evolutionary history (Hoffmeyer, 2008c). 
Finally, Cartesian dualism was linked with theological assumptions about a mighty, 
agential God, whereas our theory of agents does not require supernatural explana-
tions (though it may be reconcilable with scientifically informed/compatible reli-
gious beliefs).
The notion of the self-reproduction of organisms is more complex that most 
people think, because organisms never make exact copies of themselves. The 
dynamics of an age-structured population includes (i) the production of new organ-
isms (e.g., eggs) by a subset of adult organisms and (ii) gradual aging of all organ-
isms that survive. Fecundity rates and survival rates are age-dependent, as assumed 
in the model of Leslie (1945). If the initial population includes some organisms in a 
reproductive age interval, then according to the model, the population numbers tend 
to increase exponentially, and the age structure converges to a stable proportion of 
individuals at each age (see Fig. 6.3). The youngest cohort is the most abundant, and 
7 Some species of organisms produce progeny that from the very beginning carry most of parental 
functions, especially in cases of vegetative reproduction.

the numbers of individuals decline gradually with their age. If the average reproduc-
tion rate is greater than the average mortality rate, then the population of organisms 
keeps growing until other factors (not included in the model) limit population 
growth by either increasing mortality and/or reducing fecundity.
The model can be made more realistic by distinguishing males from females and 
considering genetic variability between organisms. In addition, offspring organisms 
may differ genetically from parents due to mutation and recombination. Despite of 
these changes, the probability distribution of organism types in a population still

becomes stable after many generations. Thus, the population can persist even if the 
type of progeny somewhat differs from that of their parents.
6.6  Types of Agents
In a hierarchy of agents (Table 6.2, 2nd row), the central position is taken by organ-
isms, which are most autonomous, robust, and complex entities. Subagents of 
organisms include organs, tissues, cells, and cell components. Multi-organism 
agents include families, colonies, populations, species, holobionts, consortia, soci-
eties, and organizations. Finally, human autonomous artifacts belong to a non-living 
type of agents.
Agents are produced in two different ways: via self-reproduction or production 
by other kinds of agents. Most organisms have unlimited heritable self-­reproduction, 
which does not decline with time, whereas many subagents of organisms do not 
reproduce (e.g., most differentiated cells and cell components) or have limited 
reproduction capacities (e.g., embryonic cells). We call agents with unlimited heri-
table self-reproduction primary agents and other agents that lack this feature – sec-
ondary agents (Fig. 6.4 and third row of Table 6.2). The class of primary agents 
includes most organisms, except those that have no self-reproduction (e.g., worker 
bees, mules). In addition, primary agents include super-organisms such as colonies, 
populations, species, and symbiotic consortia. Life originated in the form of pri-
mary agents, and it is primary agents that make up the backbone of the evolutionary 
tree. Secondary agents are produced (or recruited) by primary agents for the pur-
pose of transferring and automating some of their functions. Figuratively speaking, 
some functions of primary agents are outsourced to dependent secondary agents. 
Autonomous human artifacts (e.g., computers and robots) are examples of second-
ary agents, these are typically specialized in computational or manufacturing func-
tions. Most secondary agents are tightly associated with their hosts and make a 
functional envelope for primary agents (Sharov, 2010: 1057).

Because primary agents are self-reproducing, they are connected into lineages 
that recursively link parental agents with their progeny agents. In sexual reproduc-
tion, lineages of individual organisms are bundled into species lineages, which are 
stable and can persist for millions of years. Symbiotic consortia also belong to pri-
mary agents, because of their self-reproduction and self-support. For example, 
lichen, which is a consortium of fungus, algae, and bacteria, have vegetative repro-
duction via the separation of fragments containing cells of all interacting species. In 
addition, the fungus in lichen can reproduce by spores which are spread far away 
and germinate alone without symbionts. The fungus can survive for a while alone, 
but after some time it finds and recruits new symbiotic partners.
An interesting example of a three-way symbiosis (precisely speaking, indirect 
mutualism) is presented by Robert Ulanowicz (2009). He describes a carnivorous 
aquatic plant Utricularia, known as bladderwort, which feeds on various freshwater 
zooplankton species, such as water flea, copepods, rotifers, and infusoria. It cap-
tures these microscopic animals with leaves that have been modified into bladder-­
like traps (Fig. 6.5). A hair on the top of it works as a trigger: if touched, an opening

will emerge at the end of the bladder and a small prey is then sucked inside. The 
opening closes and the trapped animal is slowly digested. The third component of 
the system is periphyton – a biofilm of bacteria, diatoms and other algae, which cov-
ers the leaves and branches of the bladderwort. Apparently, the surface of the plant 
is a favorable habitat for periphyton due to such factors as access to light and nutri-
ents. In addition, some species of bladderwort excrete sugar compounds to attract 
bacteria and bind algae to the surface. Zooplankton species get attracted to blad-
derwort plants covered with periphyton because they feed on algae and bacteria, and 
in this way the bladderwort captures more prey. These interactions appear beneficial 
for all three components of the system: periphyton grows faster on the surface of 
bladderwort, zooplankton increases in numbers due to abundant food, and the 
excess of zooplankton is consumed by bladderwort plants.
The three-component system described by Ulanowicz is certainly a primary 
agent, since it can spread to new habitats (i.e., other lakes), which is equivalent to 
self-reproduction, and it is evolvable. The system can evolve in two ways: by the 
coevolution of component species, and by the substitution of partner species. In the 
latter case, which is discussed in detail by Ulanowicz (ibid: 73–74), biological evo-
lution can be accelerated by the transfer of ecological relations from one species to 
another. Because of partner substitution, mutualistic consortia may survive local 
extinction of individual component species (ibid: 74). Also, if a system becomes 
disrupted after environment change but component species survive by using alterna-
tive resources, then the system has a chance to be reassembled in the future if condi-
tions allow it. This example shows that organisms may have hidden capacities to 
self-organize and acquire a new identity via interaction with other species.
Mutualistic ecological consortia are somewhat similar to human social units 
such as business or government organization. Although these units are not self-­
reproducing in a biological sense, they resemble primary agents because they grow, 
self-support, and evolve on par with other superorganisms. Management principles 
may be adopted by spinoff organizations, which is somewhat similar to reproduc-
tion. Organizations can also persist for a long time despite of a continuous replace-
ment of human participants (consider the Catholic Church, with almost 2000 years 
of history9). They also accelerate the evolution of human skills because of experi-
ence transfer between participants.
The self-reproduction of primary agents does not happen instantly, given that the 
construction of a new organism takes time and resources. Reproduction is therefore 
best considered as a life cycle, where all intermediate steps are represented by some 
kind of agents that are not identical to the initial agent. The simplest life cycle is that 
of cell division, where a cell splits into two almost identical daughter cells. This 
occurs in bacteria as well as in eukaryotic single-cell organisms. Multicellular 
organisms reproduce either by releasing individual cells (e.g., eggs or sperm) or by 
developing a bud from which a new organism develops. The latter type of life cycle 
is called vegetative reproduction, and is common in plants and some groups of 
9 Christian church experienced several splits in its history, which we do not consider here.

179
animals (e.g., in Cnidaria). Reproduction by the making of individual cells is the 
only option in most multicellular animals, where it is usually combined with fertil-
ization: a sperm enters an egg to make a zygote, which develops into an embryo and 
then eventually an adult organism. The egg is usually haploid, carrying only one 
copy of each chromosome. Sperm is always haploid, and thus, after fertilization, a 
zygote obtains a double set of chromosomes drawn from two parents. Some animals 
are parthenogenetic and produce eggs with a double set of chromosomes that can 
develop without fertilization.
Plant organisms often combine vegetative and sexual reproduction. Their sexual 
reproduction differs from animals in that they produce haploid spores that are not 
capable of fertilization. Plant organisms are therefore called sporophytes. Spores 
germinate (i.e., start dividing) and make a haploid multicellular organism called a 
gametophyte. In flowering plants, the gametophyte is reduced to a few cells; but in 
ferns, the gametophyte is relatively large. The gametophyte is a haploid organism 
that makes single cells, called gamets, which are equivalent to the eggs and sperm 
of multicellular animals. Male and female gamets emerge, making a zygote that 
produces a new diploid sporophyte plant.
We generally recognize agents by their activity (cf. Row 4 in Table 6.2): flying 
butterflies and birds, crawling lizards and ants, swimming fish and jellyfish. In a 
drop of pond water under the microscope we can find swimming infusoria or crawl-
ing amoeba. The notion of an inactive agent may therefore seem self-contradictory, 
since activity is central to agents. However, some organisms do not move far, for 
various reasons. For example, plants and fungi grow but their growth is so slow that 
we cannot see it. These organisms have an active metabolism at the molecular level, 
but we cannot observe this activity directly. Besides technical difficulties with 
detecting the activity of agents, there is a more fundamental problem: some animals 
and plants stop most of their activity for a prolonged period called dormancy, which 
helps them to survive in harsh or unpredictable environments. The most common is 
winter dormancy, which helps e.g. frogs and insects to survive freezing tempera-
tures. Some animals and plants in arid climate can survive severe desiccation. For 
example, midges Polypedilum vanderplanki live in semi-arid areas of Nigeria and 
Uganda, where their larvae develop in temporary mud pools after rain. If the mud 
gets dry before the end of larval development, the larvae stop normal activity and 
synthesize a large amount of sugar trehalose that increases their resistance to desic-
cation (Kikawada et al., 2005). Larvae become completely desiccated and show no 
metabolic activity; this state is called cryptobiosis (Watanabe et al., 2003). But after 
rain, they regain their activity. A desiccated larva is thus still an agent, which activ-
ity is temporarily disabled by environmental stress, but preserves its potency to 
restore normal functions and its identity.
Dormancy with complex regulation is common in insects, where it is called dia-
pause. Prolonged insect diapause usually continues for 2–3 years (Tauber et al., 
1986), and the longest length of diapause (17 years) was recorded in the yucca moth 
(Powell, 1989). The main biological advantage of prolonged diapause is spreading 
the risk (Den Boer, 1968). In some years, a population of insects may collapse due 
to unfavorable weather, shortage of food, viral epizootics, or abundance of natural

enemies. In the following year, the population has a chance to recover after reactiva-
tion of some individuals that spent the previous year in diapause.
Now let us consider the even more controversial notion of potential agent, which 
is a system (or vehicle) that requires substantial help from other agents to become 
functional. For example, DNA in a cell is a potential agent because on its own, it 
does not move and does not use energy. However, within living cells, DNA interacts 
with various subagents that perform transcription (i.e., mRNA synthesis), duplica-
tion, and segregation of DNA copies between daughter cells. Because most herita-
ble traits are encoded in the DNA sequence, the DNA molecule functions as a carrier 
of organism identity. Since DNA is a fragile molecule, most experiments are done 
with a whole nucleus that contains all DNA molecules (chromosomes) of the 
genome. For example, if the nucleus from a skin cell of an animal is inserted into 
the empty egg cell (i.e., egg cell without nucleus) of another animal, the egg can 
start developing into an organism that is genetically identical to the donor of the 
nucleus. This is how Dolly the sheep was cloned (Wilmut et al., 1997). A virus out-
side of its host organism is another example of a potential agent. It becomes “active” 
only after infecting a host cell where it takes advantage of active cell components. 
In contrast to dormant agents, potential agents are completely inactive on their own 
and have no activation program (such as an internal clock). The activation of a virus 
occurs only after an accidental encounter with a suitable host organism. Because of 
sufficient chances for activation, viruses can evolve similar to cellular organisms.
Human texts, messages, or books are potential agents too (in addition to being 
potential signs10). They are physically inactive, but they can be picked up by moti-
vated readers who may become dedicated followers of ideas described in the texts 
or messages. These followers may in turn revive some aspects of the author’s iden-
tity, and the author (or the message itself) can be seen as one of the parental agents 
of the followers in this context. We think that the notion of potential agent captures 
the idea of Winfried Nöth (2014: 188) that symbols in a human cultural environment 
have a life of its own: “[s]ymbols are not organisms of flesh and blood, but they do 
replicate themselves like organisms do, and, in their process of their replication in 
new contexts, symbols grow in meaning”.
The autonomy of agents can be assessed in relation to (i) resources, (ii) move-
ment, and (iii) semiosis (Rows 5, 6, and 7 in Table 6.2). Resource dependency has 
been already discussed in Sect. 6.2. In terms of movement, flying and actively 
swimming animals have the highest autonomy because they can move in a three-­
dimensional space. Tree-climbing and gliding animals also fit this category. Next go 
terrestrial animals that move in two dimensions, because their activity is generally 
limited to a horizontal plane. Soil-dwelling animals often have even more limited 
movements, which may often be confined to one dimension (e.g., in burrows). 
Finally, plants and sedentary animals have only growth and no free movement.11
10 See Chap. 7.
11 This description of movement does not include some special cases, such as passive floatation on 
the water surface, or passive movement in the air aided by silk thread (in some insects and spiders) 
or fluffy appendages (in seed spread). Other special cases include movement by chewing (in bark 
6  Conceptualizing Agency

181
In terms of semiosis, the most primitive agents are protosemiotic agents that 
respond to signals without perceiving objects. Eusemiotic agents can sense and 
classify objects, but many of them rely on innate habits, these are at a mid-level. 
Cognitive animals, such as mammals and birds, are capable of true learning. The 
highest levels of cognitive autonomy are associated with symbolic and abstract 
thinking. This is typical for humans, and to a limited extent observed in other pri-
mates and other mammals.
Multicellular organisms can be classified by the origin of their parts into homo-
genic and heterogenic (Row 8 in Table 6.2). Many plants and animals are composed 
of genetically homogeneous cells with nearly identical genomes. They grow either 
from a single initial cell (a fertilized egg or oocyte) or from a group of undifferenti-
ated parental cells (in the case of vegetative reproduction). In contrast, symbiotic 
organisms or consortia (e.g., lichen) are heterogenic because their cells come from 
distant evolutionary lineages. Recent studies show that symbiosis is far more com-
mon than previously thought. In particular, the body of animals and humans appear 
to harbor ecosystems of diverse microbes (mostly in the gut and on the skin) consti-
tuting a local microbiome (Bahrndorff et al., 2016; Knight et al., 2017). A multicel-
lular organism together with its microbiome is called a holobiont (Chiu & Gilbert, 
2015; Guerrero et al., 2013).
By degree of individuation, agents can be classified into single agents, colonies, 
and swarms (cf. Row 9 in Table 6.2). Single organisms are fully functional by them-
selves, although they may require a partner for reproduction and caregiving. When 
single organisms reproduce, their progeny become fully separated from the parent. 
Other organisms make colonies by keeping the links between parental and daughter 
organisms. A typical example is the banyan tree, which spreads out by making addi-
tional roots from branches, which then become new stems with their own branches 
and so on. Similarly, corals form colonies by asexual reproduction (i.e., budding). 
An unusual example is the slime mold colony, which is formed by aggregation of 
many amoeba-like cells. Swarm agency is formed by a functional aggregation of 
fully separated free-moving individuals, such as bee swarms or bird flocks. 
Aggregations of conspecific animals or plants can be called multi-organism agents 
only if there is evidence that the aggregation behavior is adaptive and has emerged 
via either natural selection or learning and involves meaningful interaction between 
the members of the aggregation.

est canopy by growing upward).
6.6  Types of Agents

6.7  Agents and Mechanisms
The machine metaphor is often perceived as a misleading simplification of the phe-
nomena of life and mind (Deacon, 2011; Emmeche & Hoffmeyer, 1991). A com-
mon motivation for separating life and mind from mechanisms makes use of the 
following arguments: (i) machines change their state following deterministic rules 
rather than internal goals and values, (ii) machines and computers can be pro-
grammed to respond to signs but they do not understand the meaning of signs, and 
(iii) machines are manufactured and programmed by humans, whereas organisms 
are autonomous agents that self-reproduce and develop from eggs into their defini-
tive shape. Hoffmeyer (1998: 34) considered computers as non-semiotic because 
“these have not (at least yet) been constructed to depend on the creative activity of 
an analogly coded version interacting with real world processes in such a way as to 
test the fitness of the digital specifications necessary for its own construction”.
In Chap. 1, we discussed New Mechanistic Philosophy (NMP), which softens 
the dualism of life/mind versus mechanisms. Several arguments help to bridge the 
gap between mechanism and agency. First, not all mechanisms are deterministic. 
Second, the interpretation of signs is often partial in both organisms and machines. 
For example, a cell produces proteins by a ribosomal mechanism without ‘knowing’ 
or referencing the function of these proteins. Similarly, computers use only a few 
aspects of input information (e.g., the order of characters, syntax, and synonymy). 
And third, although the production of mechanisms in human industry is allopoietic 
rather than autopoietic, mechanisms facilitate the reproduction of humans and their 
technology, which in effect also facilitates the “reproduction” of the mechanisms in 
question. Machine mechanisms thus participate in human-assisted self-production, 
somewhat analogous to the production of ribosomes in a cell.
We believe that progress in the understanding of life and mind lies in bridging the 
gap between life/mind and autonomous artifacts rather than in building a wall 
between them. In particular, biological evolution can from a mechanistic perspec-
tive be seen as a sequence of inventions of various instruments that are needed to 
perform living functions (Dennett, 1995). For example, cellular processes are based 
on molecular machines that copy sequences of nucleic acids, synthesize proteins, 
modify them and assemble them into new molecular machines. According to the 
notion of autopoiesis, components of organisms are self-produced, and in light of 
this, living systems themselves can be seen as artifacts (Barbieri, 2003).
The compatibility of mechanisms and semiosis is one of the central topics of this 
book. Therefore, we explore in some detail the arguments of Hoffmeyer who 
opposed this idea. Hoffmeyer (2013: 155) wrote:
In a biosemiotic optic, the genome is best understood as a very sophisticated “inventory 
control system,” a system that not only contains the specifications necessary to produce all 
the body’s protein and RNA molecules, but also a number of switches and locks by which 
an agent may access the archives. [...] So, if we imagine this as a computerized system and 
a given enzyme is needed, say a peptidase, the cell will click down the menu for enzymes, 
pick the submenu of peptidases, and select a suitable one among the different kinds of pep-
tidases on offer, depending on the kind of tissue and/or the concrete situation. [...] The most 
6  Conceptualizing Agency

183
important factor that has been turned around in the semiotic description of this process rela-
tive to more traditional informational descriptions, is that agency here resides within the 
cell, the tissue, or the organism, not with the genetic system. Harvard geneticist Richard 
Lewontin expressed clearly why this is necessary when he state that “genes do nothing”.
According to Hoffmeyer, agency resides within a whole cell but not within genes 
or other cell components. He further assumed that intracellular components form a 
computer-like mechanism, on which a cell “clicks down the menu” and makes 
selections. But how a cell can “click down the menu” and make selections without 
mechanisms? In fact, Hoffmeyer is fully aware of these mechanisms (e.g., sensing 
of external molecules, signal transduction, chromatin remodeling, and binding of 
transcription factors), describing them in the same paper and admitting that these 
mechanisms perform semiotic functions. He shows, for example, that an “unknown 
molecular signal” (sign vehicle) is transmitted to the nucleus of a cell and causes the 
binding of the transcription complex to the promoter of SRY gene, and this action is 
an interpretant which functions as a sign vehicle for the next step of interpretation 
(ibid: 154).
Apparently, Hoffmeyer denied agency and semiosis in cell components because 
each component does not capture the full meaning of molecular signs. For example, 
a membrane receptor in the cell does not ‘know’ the function of an external molecu-
lar signal. Similarly, proteins that perform DNA copying do not capture the full 
meaning of the processed genetic information. They handle one nucleotide at a 
time, and thus, cannot detect information encoded by the order of nucleotides in 
the DNA.
In contrast to Hoffmeyer, we assume that simple autonomous mechanisms (e.g., 
a ribosome or RNA polymerase complex) can participate in the interpretation of 
molecular signs even if they capture only a small portion of their meaning. Partial 
interpretation of signs is a common phenomenon in all agents, including cells and 
whole organisms, even humans. Workers in a factory, for instance, can produce 
specific machine parts without necessarily having any overview of the whole pro-
duction process.
Hoffmeyer’s position on agency does not help to explain the origin of life. Life 
did not originate in the form of full-fledged cells, and the best biosemiotic approach 
to the origin of life is not one that must assert that life originated before semiosis did 
(which would contradict the main biosemiotic thesis, namely that life and semiosis 
are co-extensive). All existing scenarios of the origin of life assume that cells origi-
nated from simple primordial self-reproducing mechanisms, comparable in their 
functions to cell components (see Chap. 5).
Lawrence Cahoone (2013: 171) has argued that Hoffmeyer’s version of biosemi-
otics needs to account for a primitive version of semiosis that can be performed by 
mechanisms:
Now, the ribosome does seem to read RNA. It seems legitimate to regard this as some kind 
of proto-semiosis. There is a reading of the information in a nucleotide sequence, and a 
construction of a matching sequence of amino acids. This is transcription (by mRNA) and 
translation (by tRNA), but is it interpretation? If so, it is a very mechanical kind of interpre-
tation, like a thermostat reading temperature or a computer translating Morse code. 
6.7  Agents and Mechanisms

184
Furthermore, does the cell interpret the RNA or does the ribosome? If the latter, does this 
expand semiosis beyond the living, since we may ask, is a ribosome alive?
We agree with Cahoone that a ribosome is a proto-agency capable of “reading” 
the RNA, and that this proto-semiotic process is performed by molecular mecha-
nisms. It is not that important whether or not a ribosome qualifies to be called ‘alive’ 
in its own right, but it is certainly an autonomous semiotic agent.
One of the heuristics of systems study is “functionalism”, which assumes that 
systems should be compared solely based on their functions rather than on their 
material composition. The idea was initially proposed as a foundation for “rela-
tional biology” (Rashevsky, 1938; Rosen, 1970), and was later called “functional 
isomorphism” (Putnam, 1975). If an artificial system performs the same (or similar) 
functions as a living organism, then, according to functionalism, there is good rea-
son to call it “alive”. However, it would be confusing and misleading to apply the 
term “living organism” to artificial devices. It is better and more accurate to use the 
term “agent”, which is equally fitting for living organisms and human-made autono-
mous devices.
Finally, we would like to note that biological analysis of cell mechanisms is car-
dinally different from the way mechanisms are studied in physics. Physics is focused 
on predicting system dynamics based on universal laws and a priori defined initial 
and boundary conditions. In contrast, biologists explore possible qualitative out-
comes in various scenarios of molecular activity, such as the production of new 
functional subagents, the modification of their activity via specific signal transduc-
tion pathways, and disposing molecular units that are not functional or not needed. 
In these transformations, boundary conditions are updated dynamically in order to 
either preserve a homeostatic state or switch to an entirely new dynamic attractor. 
Thus, biological approaches to mechanisms are in fact semiotic, although most 
biologists do not currently realize this. Our agential, semiotic approach explains 
phenomena such as cell function, adaptation, and evolution, which are not discussed 
in physics.

Chapter 7
Semiosis
Abstract  Sign is a semiotic tool, whose form is meaningful for certain agents. 
Agents use signs to regulate their activities, communicate with others, and accumu-
late knowledge in the form of heredity, memory, perception, representation, and 
cognition. Sign processes, collectively known as semiosis, vary in their complexity 
and function, and their types roughly fall in line with the hierarchy of agents. 
Actions of agents are always sign-mediated, and draw on some form of experience, 
which is also sign-mediated. The main difference between signs and agents is that 
the role of signs is to signify to agents, whereas the role of agents is to interpret 
signs and act accordingly. In a system hierarchy, agents are above signs because 
agents perform interpretation and create or reshape sign relations. We integrate the 
concept of semiosis with the notion of information in the sense of Gregory Bateson. 
Two aspects of signs are distinguished: a sign process has a material side and is 
space-time specific. A sign relation is a type of sign process that is embodied and 
encoded in an agent. Agents use sign relations to control material processes, and 
thereby have some powers to change matter. The second half of the chapter presents 
an overview of two basic levels of semiosis: (1) protosemiosis is a mechanistic pro-
cessing of signals inside living cells, where objects are not perceived; (2) eusemio-
sis constitutes a ‘minimal mind’ that supports perception and recognition 
(categorization) of objects.
7.1  Types of Signs and Semiosis
The contemporary understanding of signs is built mostly on the classical work of 
Ferdinand de Saussure and Charles Sanders Peirce. Saussure (1959) developed the 
notion of linguistic sign, which is composed of a signifier (sound-image) and signi-
fied (concept or meaning), and distinguished them from acoustic uttering and writ-
ten words. While the latter may be fixed, the meaning of a signifier may vary 
depending on the conventions of a language. Peirce’s theory is based on the triadic 
relation between sign vehicle (representamen), object, and interpretant. He wrote:

190
I define a sign as anything which is so determined by something else, called its Object, and 
so determines an effect upon a person, which effect I call its interpretant, that the later is 
thereby mediately determined by the former. (Peirce, 1998 [1893–1913]: EP2.478)
Peirce’s sign relation does not include an agent or interpreter, but it can be seen as a 
surrogate of agency: it is an agent stripped down of any features, except those that 
participate in a specific sign process. Peirce used the notion of sign beyond the lin-
guistic realm and applied it also to images, signals, thoughts, clues, and events. He 
distinguished between three main types of signs1: icons, indexes, and symbols that 
signify their objects by similarity, pointing (or reference), and convention (or habit), 
respectively (Peirce, 1931–1958: CP2.243-265). Thomas Sebeok was among the 
first who systematically applied semiotic terminology to the cognitive behavior of 
non-human animals (Sebeok, 1976). He proposed six ‘species of signs’: signal, 
symptom, icon, index, symbol, and name (Sebeok, 2001: 44–60). Umberto Eco 
classified signs into natural and artificial (Guillemette & Cossette, 2006), where the 
natural signs are those that are not produced by agents for signification and com-
munication purposes. Examples of natural signs are the sun, trees, flowers, and foot-
prints, as these are interpreted by humans or animals. In contrast, artificial signs 
(e.g., pheromones, bird songs, mental representations, and human books) are cre-
ated by agents for signification and/or communication purposes. The majority of 
artificial signs would never have existed materially if they had not been produced by 
agents for semiotic purposes.
The scope and diversity of sign processes, collectively known as semiosis, has 
expanded considerably with the rise of biosemiotics, which assumes that life and 
semiosis are coextensive (Anderson et al., 1984). In this view, there are also non-­
mental signs, at work in living cells and even in intracellular molecular processes, 
such as DNA replication and protein synthesis. Since living organisms represent a 
wide spectrum of complexity, functionality, and adaptability, it is natural that forms 
of signs and their complexity vary accordingly. One of the important tasks of biose-
miotics is to develop criteria for classifying sign processes (Kull, 2009). The most 
common way of classifying sign processes has been based on their occurrence in 
various systematic groups or levels of organization (Fig. 7.1). For example, zoose-
miosis refers to semiotic processes in animals (Martinelli, 2010; Sebeok, 1963) and 
phytosemiosis - to semiotic processes in plants (Krampen, 1981). Thomas Sebeok 
(1976) distinguished between endosemiotic and exosemiotic processes. The former 
refers to internal signification and communication in-between parts of an organism 
(organs, tissues, and cells), whereas the latter refers to the sign-mediated interaction 
of organisms with their environments and with other organisms. The notion of 
endosemiosis was later elaborated by Thure von Uexküll et al. (1993).
The discovery of molecular-level information processes in living cells prompted 
the introduction of the term protosemiosis – a primitive kind of interpretation of 
signs which is supported by mechanisms (Prodi, 1988a; Sharov, 2013; Sharov & 
1 Besides the icon-index-symbol triad, Peirce also proposed a combinatorial classification that 
included 10 types of signs, and many further distinctions.

Vehkavaara, 2015). Protosemiosis includes signaling pathways related to metabo-
lism and its regulation, such as transcription (i.e., mRNA synthesis), translation 
(protein synthesis), and signal transduction. In addition, vertical semiosis was sug-
gested to designate the transfer of hereditary messages between successive genera-
tions, as opposed to horizontal semiosis, which refers to both endo- and exo-semiotic 
interactions of individual organisms (Hoffmeyer, 1996).
Semiotic processes at the organism level include phytosemiosis and zoosemio-
sis; they are necessary for managing growth, development, and, in the case of ani-
mals, − behavior. Behavior patterns are strongly affected by social interactions 
between conspecific organisms; regulation of these interactions belongs to what is 
called social semiosis. Human communities have developed advanced forms of 
sociality that include organizations and culture. The latter can be understood as a 
system of historically accumulated and modified forms of behavior, knowledge, 
beliefs, attitudes, and values/goals, integrated by language and other communica-
tion media. Cultural semiosis therefore deserves a special status and should be 
regarded separately from social semiosis generally. Evolutionary semiosis refers to 
long-term events of adaptation and coadaptation in populations, species, and

higher-­level taxonomic lineages. Finally, ecosemiosis includes sign processes in the 
ecological realm. Organisms interact with the physical environment and with other 
organisms. From a holistic, unified perspective, organisms take part in the informa-
tional network which is created by the semiotic activities of all species in a certain 
habitat or ecosystem. This totality of semiosis can be referred to as the semiosphere 
(Hoffmeyer, 1996).2
Thure von Uexküll (1997) distinguishes between three types of semiotic phe-
nomena depending on the participation of the emitter and receiver of signs: infor-
mation (or signification), symptomatization, and communication. Dario Martinelli 
used a similar classification for zoosemiotics and named these types as: “significa-
tion”, when semiosis involves just a receiver interpreting a sign, “representation”, 
when a sign is produced by a sender to represent something, and “communication”, 
when the sender and receiver interact semiotically (Martinelli, 2010: 1). By repre-
sentation, Martinelli means “the way animals construct sense and, often, but not 
always, offer it to somebody else” (ibid., italics original). We generally agree with 
this approach of classifying semiosis, which is based on the role of agents (subjects, 
as senders and receivers of signs). However, we would like to make this classifica-
tion applicable to protosemiosis. The term “representation” is already taken in psy-
chology and semiotics,3 and it cannot be extended to such protosemiotic processes 
as DNA replication, signal transduction, or protein synthesis. Thus, we expand it to 
a broader category of production and manipulation of signs (where ‘sign’ means 
‘sign vehicle’). Besides mental representations, this category of sign processes 
includes copying, modification, and delivery of signs. All three types of semiosis 
include what Peirce called “interpretation”, but in different aspects. Examples of 
signification, production/manipulation of signs, and communication are shown in 
Table 7.1.
Like metabolism, semiosis is a routine activity for all organisms, though it comes 
in many different forms. Most acts of semiosis are nearly exact copies of semiotic 
activities performed by the agent or its ancestors in the past. However, occasionally, 
agents face new challenges that require that a new solution is found, and this is 
particularly the case for cognitively complex animals. In this book, we therefore pay 
attention to a special kind of semiosis, which is the emergence of new kinds of sign 
relations, as opposed to routine semiosis. We call this semiogenesis4 and devote 
Chap. 8 to a depiction of its role in evolution, development, and learning. In 
Table 7.1, semiogenesis would be a subcategory of ‘production of signs’, such as 
evolutionary or developmental adaptation, or producing a new mental 
representation.
The distinction between routine semiosis and semiogenesis is not trivial. Animals 
with advanced cognitive capabilities easily adjust the meanings of signs to various

sis, or as a global term incorporating all semiosis on planet Earth.

contexts, and this always constitutes a certain degree of novelty. The capacity to 
construct new meanings on the fly is highly developed in humans, who utilize the 
generative grammar rules of language to interpret new combinations of words 
(Chomsky, 1965). To make the distinction clear, we can define routine semiosis as a 
process involving a sign that is either habitual, accidental,5 or extrapolative. Habitual 
interpretation (or production) of signs is based on well-known cognitive and signal-
ing pathways. Accidental interpretation (or production) of a sign is not yet a novelty 
unless it is reinforced and becomes a new habit or communication tool. Similarly, 
meanings of signs that are extrapolated to familiar contexts or integrated into valid 
linguistic expressions are not fully novel because extrapolation rules are built into 
the cognitive architecture as routine elements. Semiogenesis requires stronger nov-
elty in comparison to routine semiosis, and generally takes longer times to emerge.
5 Here ‘accidental’ means non-intentional and non-encoded. Generally speaking, accidental inter-
pretation is not random because it is constraint by functional and semiotic organization of the 
agent. But in some contexts it can be seen as random.

7.2  Signs as Semiotic Instruments
We adopt an instrumental approach to semiotics, where signs are semiotic instru-
ments of agents.6 Marcel Danesi (2010: 138) wrote: “In effect, signs are tools – 
things (real or imaginary) that extend some sensory, physical, or intellectual 
capacity”. The instrumental approach to signs does not in any way mean that semio-
sis is always mechanistic, although we believe that the lower levels of semiosis are 
always mechanistic. Physicists explore matter looking for mechanisms, and the 
results of measurements are represented by signs in form of indices (e.g., the devia-
tion of a voltmeter arm from the zero level). Similarly, organisms use parts of their 
body as mechanisms to detect and measure the state of the world as expressed by 
signs (Fernández, 2008). Molecular-level sensorial mechanisms include chemore-
ceptors and photoreceptors, which convert external signs into internal signs that can 
be processed meaningfully by other cell components and ultimately by the organ-
ism.7 Like human instruments, signs are either produced by agents (e.g., signals) or 
picked up in nature if they are suitable for some purpose (e.g., cues). Like technical 
instruments, signs can be stored in depots for future use (e.g., in memory). However, 
not every instrument is a sign. A hammer is generally not a sign, but a key is a sign. 
The difference is that the utilized feature of a sign is its meaningful form8 rather than 
matter or energy.
By interpreting signs, agents initiate or modify their actions in a beneficial way9 
(Witzany, 2009). Such actions may include acquiring resources (e.g., food), produc-
tion of body components (e.g., inner resources, structural elements, or sub-agents), 
and reproduction. The performance of semiotic functions of living cells, such as 
copying, editing, transmission, and interpretation of hereditary signs, are also gen-
erally beneficial in the long run.
Not every physical form can turn into a sign; to be a sign it has to be meaningful 
and make a difference for some agent. Only meaningful forms with some kind of 
functional relevance can signify, but the majority of forms are meaningless and 
useless. For example, the number of potential forms for a single protein molecule10 
6 By instruments we do not mean abstract notions used merely for the convenience of a researcher. 
Instead, signs are semiotic instruments of those agents that are under investigation. To avoid confu-
sion, we remind the reader that the term ‘sign’ is used in the sense of ‘sign vehicle’ unless it is 
specified otherwise.
7 Here we consider signs from the stance of a meta-observer (e.g., a scientist). Molecular receptors 
do not “know” that they participate in information-processing. They act according to their design, 
similar to a thermostat.
8 Also called ‘information’, which is “a difference which makes a difference” (Bateson, 1987 
[1972]: 459).
9 Benefits are implicitly expected from the use of signs, but they are not always obtained.
10 Kauffman (2009) found that theoretically possible variations of a single protein molecule are 
more numerous than the number of particles in the universe. Moreover, the probability of each 
variation appearing cannot be assessed because there is not enough time in the history of the uni-
verse for realization of all variations.

far exceeds the number of potential meanings. In hierarchically organized agents, 
meanings are often interconnected across hierarchy levels via inclusive relations – a 
sign that is meaningful for a subagent often becomes meaningful (indirectly) for the 
higher-level agent which includes the subagent. For example, a key is “meaningful” 
for a lock when the lock is used by a human and plays the role of a dependent sub-
agent. Then, indirectly, the key is meaningful for a person who owns the lock. An 
odorant is meaningful for an olfactory receptor, and indirectly, it is also meaningful 
to an animal that carries this receptor in its nose. In summary, signs are semiotic 
instruments carrying meaningful forms utilized by agents for regulating their goal-­
directed activities and communication. In the case of mental signs, we do not know 
the nature of a sign vehicle and its form, but it makes sense to assume that some kind 
of physical form exists for mental signs as well.
The instrumental notion of sign is often rejected from the position of Peirce’s 
semiotics. For example, Winfried Nöth (2008: 325) wrote:
Although, in a way, it is true that human sign users create the signs and use them as their 
extensions, it is also true that humans are themselves signs. [...] Now, if humans are signs, 
and signs are instruments, which instrumental purpose do we humans serve? The idea that 
sign users, like messengers, are instruments serving to convey somebody else’s message is 
against the basic assumption of the autonomy of human beings.
Here, Nöth erroneously assumes that serving an instrumental purpose (that of 
serving as a sign for someone) violates human autonomy. However, the instrumen-
tal use of humans does not rule out respect for their autonomy – for instance, you 
can pay someone to cut your hair without being disrespectful of the hairdresser’s 
autonomy and dignity. Our disrespect for other humans, if any, lies not in our instru-
mental use of them as such, but in how we value and treat them (e.g. by reducing 
them to instruments only). Humans can serve as signs either intentionally (e.g., by 
communicating friendliness, or providing information) or unintentionally (e.g., a 
man with umbrella indicates rain). Human autonomy does not have to be seriously 
compromised in any of these cases.
7.3  Signs Are Agent-Specific
In biosemiotics, sign processes are regarded as agent-specific. This is the key fea-
ture of the Umwelt theory of von Uexküll (1982 [1940]: 29–30), who wrote:
Let us consider, for example, the stem of a blooming meadow-flower and ask ourselves 
which roles are assigned to it in the following four Umwelts: (1) In the Umwelt of a girl 
picking flowers, who gathers herself a bunch of colorful flowers that she uses to adorn her 
bodice; (2) In the Umwelt of an ant, which uses the regular design of the stem-surface as the 
ideal path in order to reach its food-area in the flowerpetals; (3) In the Umwelt of a cicada-­
larva, which bores into the sap-paths of the stem and uses it to extract the sap in order to 
construct the liquid walls of its airy house; (4) In the Umwelt of a cow, which grasps the 
stems and the flowers in order to push them into its wide mouth and utilizes them as fodder. 
According to the Umwelt-stage on which it appears, the identical flower stem at times plays 
7.3  Signs Are Agent-Specific

196
the role of an ornament, sometimes the role of a path, sometimes the role of an extraction-­
point, and finally the role of a morsel of food.
Another example of agent-specific interpretation is related to the aggregation 
pheromone of bark beetles. This pheromone is released by a beetle to attract other 
beetles of the same species to the infested tree for the purposes of mating and 
resource exploitation. The beetle’s behavior is beneficial for beetles because a col-
lective attack involving many individuals weakens the tree and increases the chances 
of its successful colonization. The same pheromone, however, is used as a cue by 
predators (Cleridae beetles), leading them to the bark beetles they prey on (Aukema 
& Raffa, 2005). Different agents interpret the same thing in distinct ways, because 
they have different sense organs, interpretation methods, and are guided by differ-
ent goals.
Agent-specific interpretation of signs is a key feature of this approach which thus 
provides biosemiotics theory with an empirical grounding. A sign vehicle for one 
agent is only a piece of junk for a different agent. Organisms differ in their capacity 
to detect and evaluate signs, which constitutes their first semiotic filter. They sense 
different portions of their environment. In addition, organisms differ in their aware-
ness of correlations and regularities in nature because of their specific evolution, 
development, and learning history. This second semiotic filter constraints and speci-
fies their capacity for using signs to predict future changes or uncovering the causes 
of processes and events. Signs identified by humans may thus appear non-relevant 
for animals that have different senses and knowledge, and vice versa.
Because signs do not always play their semiotic role, it is important to distin-
guish between effective signs (when used as such) and potential signs that currently 
do not play a semiotic role. This distinction is parallel to opposing effective and 
potential information (Queiroz et al., 2008). Similar to instruments that become 
functional only when associated with users (Fernández, 2008), signs should be 
accessible to agents in order to become interpreted. Thus, potential signs require 
either a direct access to interpreting agents or at least a real possibility of establish-
ing such access. For example, memories are potential signs because they are inte-
grated into cognitive networks and can be activated when necessary. Similarly, 
silent genes in a cell are potential signs because they are located inside of a compe-
tent agent and can become activated.
To clarify the notion of potential sign, consider a simple example, where a human 
uses a key to lock a barn door. When the key is separated from the lock, it is a poten-
tial sign. When it is used to open or close the lock, the key becomes an efficient sign. 
The lock is a simple semiotic agent when it is operated by a person. It is not active 
by itself, but it can become activated by a human. In this case, the lock represents 
the human who locked the door and protects his/her property from potential intrud-
ers. The lock is manufactured to perform the function of property protection, and it 
performs it by not opening without a key. Most agents are active by moving and 
doing something. But some functions require resistance to movement, and this 
resistance is also functional. In our example, the lock performs its function by not 
opening. The lock is a semiotic agency because it “recognizes” the key, which is a 
7  Semiosis

197
sign, by either opening or not opening.11 This interpretation is mechanistic but not 
deterministic because the lock can malfunction (e.g., due to rust or damage). The 
lock has an internal sign, which is a complementary copy of the lock pattern, but 
this sign is concealed. If it were accessible, it would be easy to make a key dupli-
cate. The internal sign controls the access to energy, which is the capacity of a 
human to turn the key inserted in the lock.
7.4  Sign Processes and Sign Relations
Signs have two aspects: first, they are material processes with specific space-time 
constraints that involve an agent/interpreter, sign vehicle, object, and interpretant; 
and second, signs are types of sign processes, which are embodied and encoded by 
an agent. The former material aspect constitutes a sign process, and the latter more 
abstract aspect is a sign relation.12 Note that the duality of a sign process and sign 
relation is more than a token-type theoretical construct, because here, the type (i.e., 
sign relation) is also embodied and encoded by a natural agent. Although sign pro-
cesses have a material side, they are not deterministic, because they depend on such 
immeasurable features as the prehistory of the agent (including evolution, develop-
ment, learning, and experience) and detailed situational context. Thus, sign pro-
cesses have to be dissected using semiotic causation (in addition to physical efficient 
causation13), which has been defined as “the bringing about of changes under the 
guidance of interpretation” (Hoffmeyer, 2008b: 149). We discuss semiotic causation 
and the related notion of semiotic freedom in more details in Chap. 8 “Semiogenesis” 
and Chap. 9 “Phenomenology”.
In the analysis of sign relations we continue the tradition of Sebeok (1976) and 
Hoffmeyer (2008a), who merged the semiotic theories of Peirce (1998 [1893–1913]), 
Morris (1977), and von Uexküll (1982 [1940]). Our contribution to this topic is that 
(i) we show the difference between protosemiosis in simple organisms (e.g., bacte-
ria) and eusemiosis in eukaryotic organisms, and (ii) dissect intermediate steps in 
eusemiotic perception that include integration of sensory signals and object recog-
nition (categorization). According to Peirce (1998 [1893–1913]: EP2.478), a sign 
relation interconnects a sign vehicle (representamen), an object, and an interpretant, 
which is the result of interpretation. Peirce did not include an interpreter (or agent) 
into the sign relation, and thus, Peirce’s sign relations are not agent-specific; they 
11 There are different levels of complexity of lock-and-key systems. Here we consider the simplest 
one where the form of the key is static. In biochemical lock-and-key systems, the form of a “key” 
component emerges as a result of its interaction with the “lock” component (Schneider, 2015). But 
even mechanical locks have a dynamic “anti-key” form, where the position of pins pushed by 
springs emerges in the process of their interaction with the key.
12 Here we use ideas of Kalevi Kull which were presented at the Biosemiotics Glade online seminar 
on December 18, 2020.
13 For example, physical causation appears useful in the context of criminal investigations.

include interpretations of a sign by all possible agents in all situations or contexts. 
In contrast, biosemiotics is focused on first-person (i.e., phenomenological) sign 
relations that are grounded in the evolution, development, and learning of a certain 
agent (or agent type). The importance of the agent or interpreter in semiosis was 
emphasized by Charles Morris (1971, 1977). Following Morris, we consider the 
agent/interpreter as a core component of sign relations, because it is the agent that 
interprets a sign and generates an interpretant. Based on von Uexküll’s theory, we 
assume that organisms can develop a first-person, subjective world of a phenomeno-
logical nature that includes agent-specific objects and interpretants. This approach, 
which we call “agential” or “agency-centered” biosemiotics, considers agency in its 
totality of functions and history. An agent is more than a set of sign relations because 
it embodies a goal-directed functional organization and uses signs as instruments 
for supporting its identity and power.
The structure of a sign relation depends on the semiotic competence of the agent. 
Simple organisms (e.g., bacteria) lack the capacity to perceive outside objects 
(Sharov & Vehkavaara, 2015). To regulate their functions, bacteria use primitive 
signs – signals that are interpreted directly as actions without making an association 
with an object. This kind of sign processes is known as protosemiosis. The term 
‘proto-semiotics’ was introduced by Giorgio Prodi in relation to molecular pro-
cesses in cells, such as detection of specific molecules by protein receptors (Prodi, 
1988b). The reason why Prodi considered molecular signaling in living cells as 
semiotic was the specificity of a reader to the sign. He wrote: “This semiotics (or 
proto-semiotics) is the basic feature of the whole biological organization (protein 
synthesis, metabolism, hormone activity, transmission of nervous impulse, and so 
on). In all these cases a specific relationship between a reader and its sign is clearly 
established” (Prodi, 1988b, cited in Favareau, 2010a: 329). To this we add that 
molecular signals are not only specific but also functional because they are used to 
initiate and/or regulate actions of autonomous and goal-directed (sub)agents, such 
as cells and their components.
Let’s consider bacterial chemotaxis as an example of protosemiosis (Fig. 7.2a). 
A bacterium detects glucose by using protein receptors on the surface of the cell. If 
a glucose molecule binds to the outer end of a receptor, the whole protein receptor 
molecule changes its shape (conformation), which serves as a sign for the bacterial 
cell, which is then interpreted by activating the rotation of flagella that propel the 
cell forward in the direction of glucose. The mechanism of interpretation includes 
the production of a secondary messenger (phosphorylated CheA protein) by the 
activated protein receptor, and the messenger transfers the signal to flagella (Porter 
et al., 2011). Here, glucose is the object, its binding to the protein receptor is the 
sign, and the rotation of flagella is the interpretant. A specific feature of protosemio-
sis is that objects are only detected but not perceived by the agent (Sharov & 
Vehkavaara, 2015). Perception requires pattern recognition within a large set of 
separately “wired” sensorial inputs related to one and the same object (see below), 
but here only one signal is generated after glucose binds to the receptor. Bacterial 
cells do not have additional senses to examine the composition of a glucose 
molecule.

In addition to chemoreceptors, bacteria have a special signaling pathway to 
detect glucose shortage. The signal comes from a protein that normally brings

Fig. 7.2  Scheme of sign relations that combine multiple semiotic theories (see details in the text): 
(a) a primitive sign relation typical for agents without mind (protosemiosis); (b) enriched sign 
relation in agents with mind (eusemiosis). The example of protosemiosis is bacterial chemotaxis 
(sensing glucose and moving towards it); and the example of eusemiosis is the interpretation of 
rabbit tracks by a hungry fox. In eusemiosis, agents develop an Umwelt – an iconic model of the 
world, where perceived objects are associated with habits and functional meanings in the Innenwelt. 
The activities of a fox are mediated by its Umwelt, whereas bacterial activity (i.e., swimming 
towards glucose) is not mediated by any Umwelt. Thus, the interactions of bacteria with the world 
can be explored only by external observers (e.g., biologists) – and the corresponding arrows in the 
figure (a) are dashed. All the components of sign relations are supported by habits (gray boxes) 
which emerged in evolution or via learning (available only in eusemiosis) as representations of the 
historical interaction of agents with objects

glucose into the cell. If this protein is idle (i.e., in the absence of glucose), then it 
activates synthesis of cAMP (a starvation signal) that switches metabolism to pro-
cessing of alternative nutrients (Bettenbrock et al., 2007). This signaling pathway is 
completely independent from chemoreceptors that control chemotaxis, as if they 
detect different objects, although both of them interact with the same glucose 
molecules.
This example is typical for the entire sensorial system of bacteria because they 
are not capable of perceiving objects. They live in a “solipsistic” experiential world 
where only signals are available, and these are not informative enough to be associ-
ated with specific components of empirical reality (i.e., objects). Moreover, bacteria 
generally do not separate “inside” from “outside” because signals (i.e., secondary 
messengers) generated by internal and external receptors are processed by similar 
molecular pathways.14 Bacteria have a primitive version of the subjective world, 
which we call a signal-world (Fig. 7.2a). Such a subjective world includes only 
signals of various kinds and is not differentiated into an Umwelt and an Innenwelt, 
which capture the external and internal portions, respectively, of the experiential 
world of animals (von Uexküll, 1921; see Fig. 7.2b). The simplified functional cir-
cles of bacteria are confined to the signal-world and do not refer to external reality, 
in contrast to functional circles in animals, which interconnect the subject and the 
object (see Fig. 2.1).
The idea that simple organisms lack a capacity to perceive objects has been 
expressed before. Brogaard (1999: 207) wrote: “Non-human animals such as micro-­
organisms may have both appetite and a primitive form of sensation, but they have 
presumably no appearance or perception of bounded, solid objects located in space 
and time”. Similarly, Martin Krampen argued that there are no objects in phytose-
miosis. He wrote (Krampen, 1981, cited in Favareau, 2010a: 268): “In the absence 
of a functional cycle in plants, there is no way by which different afferent signals 
can be fitted together with efferent signals to form the signifiers and signifieds of 
‘objects’”.15
Von Uexküll calls the non-perceived outer world of an organism the Umgebung; 
it means the surroundings that have an impact on the organism in terms of physics 
or chemistry (Tønnessen, 2019: 419). For example, glucose belongs to the Umgebung 
of bacteria unless it is bound to bacterial chemoreceptors and thus sensed by the 
bacteria. Although glucose is not perceived by bacteria, it still can be considered as 
14 This does not preclude bacteria from interaction with external objects. Many bacteria have pro-
tein appendages called pili, which are used for automated interaction with external objects. Pili are 
used for immune defense (because of their antigenic properties) and for binding to the outer sur-
faces. Some bacteria have tools for distal sensing, such as photoreceptors and magnetoreceptors, 
although bacteria do not associate these senses with distal sources of light or magnetic field.
15 We disagree that perception of objects and functional circles (defined by Uexküll 1957) are not 
available in plants. The root endings of plants can presumably recognize objects such as soil types 
or roots of other plants and select the direction of their growth. Also, plants have functional circles, 
such as making a bud in a broken stem or branch which produces a young shoot. However, the 
capacity of plants to perceive objects and perform functional cycles is substantially limited as 
compared to the capacities of animals.

an object-component of the bacterial sign relation, because the presence of glucose 
in the environment has shaped the evolution of bacteria for billions of years. Glucose 
has an imprint in the bacterial genome, which can be seen as a simple version of an 
“idea” or “ground”, as advocated by Peirce (1931–1958: CP2.228). The imprint of 
glucose is represented by habits of sensing, association, and movement, which 
emerged in evolution and empower bacterial agents to interpret signals of glucose 
binding to receptor protein.
The object is an important component of sign relations because it serves as a 
criterion of deception. If bacterial chemoreceptors bind molecules of an artificial 
sweetener that have a similar shape to glucose, they may send erroneous and pos-
sibly damaging signals to cell metabolism because the sweetener has different prop-
erties than the genetically expected object (glucose). This effect can explain why 
consumption of artificial sweeteners by mice may result in a change of gut micro-
biota, as reported by Suez et  al. (2014). Although bacterial cells cannot detect 
deception, because they do not perceive glucose as objects, the evolving lineages of 
bacteria can be more successful in detecting it as a result of differential survival of 
clones, and by modifying their sensing capabilities and/or metabolism by natural 
selection to increase survival.
Protosemiosis exists not only in bacteria but also in the metabolism of eukaryotic 
organisms, where it is combined with eusemiosis, which occurs at higher functional 
levels. According to Thure von Uexküll (1986: 211), vegetative organisms (includ-
ing plants and fungi) and individual cells do not perceive objects in the outside 
world: “Plants are solipsistic systems. Since they do not know about objects there is 
no point of describing them as subjects. They are only able to distinguish ‘self’ and 
‘nonself’”. Although we agree that many processes in plants (especially cell metab-
olism) are fully autonomous and not dependent on sensing of outside objects, the 
overall conclusion of Thure von Uexküll that plants are solipsistic is not true (see 
footnote 14). Plant branches grow in the direction of light and away from the shade. 
Cells in a plant communicate by releasing and sensing growth factors and hor-
mones. Carnivorous plants develop complex traps meant for capturing insects and 
other small animals, and these traps operate via sensing the touch of a moving ani-
mal. An overview of semiosis in plants can be found in the paper “Phytosemiosis” 
by Martin Krampen (1981).
Frederick Stjernfelt described bacterial chemotaxis as involving a dicisign, a 
kind of signs introduced by Peirce. According to Stjernfelt (2014: 1), the dicisign “is 
a sign that which makes a truth claim due to its double involvement – denotative and 
descriptive – with the same object” . The key example of a dicisign is a proposition 
that specifies the quality or state of an object, such as “The cat is on the mat”. In 
contrast to Peirce, who viewed propositions as elements of human language and 
logic, Stjernfelt proposes a purely functional interpretation of propositions (he calls 
them ‘natural propositions’), where ‘truth’ is replaced by ‘utility’. He interprets the 
dicisign of bacteria as a habit “acquired phylogenetically”, which “connects a spe-
cific, typical aspect of molecular shape, with a specific, typical action” (Stjernfelt, 
2014: 142).
7.4  Sign Processes and Sign Relations

202
We agree that bacterial cells can connect glucose sensing with the rotation of 
flagella, which cause bacterial movement. However, this connection is not a sign for 
bacteria. Instead, bacteria use the genome to make protein tools for sensing and 
interpreting signals. The genome does not instruct bacteria with regard to how pro-
teins should interact with each other, because the function of proteins is not deter-
mined by the sequence of nucleotides (see Chap. 8 for details). The function of 
proteins emerges as a result of the interaction of many cell subagents in their physi-
cal form, including ribosomes, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase, membrane organiza-
tion, flagella, to list just a few. Thus, the connection between sensing glucose and 
flagella motion is not encoded anywhere in bacteria.16 But the bacterial genome can 
be explored by a molecular biologist, who by using abduction can predict this con-
nection by combining facts about the genome with experimental knowledge of pro-
tein functions. We therefore disagree with Stjernfelt who holds that bacteria are 
instructed by a dicisign on how to connect the sensing of glucose with flagella 
motion. Instead, bacteria perform physiological functions without ‘knowing’ what 
they actually do and for what purpose.
The emergence of a minimal mind in organisms is one of the major steps in the 
evolution of semiosis, which we call eusemiosis. Most likely it occurred after the 
origin of eukaryotic cells (see Chap. 4), although more developed minds appeared 
only in multicellular animals after the origin of nervous system. Agents with mini-
mal mind have diverse sign processes: some of them (e.g., in metabolism, signal 
transduction, and gene activation) still belong to protosemiosis, however other pro-
cesses that involve perception and handling of objects may belong to the early 
stages of eusemiosis. In single-cell eukaryotes, eusemiotic interactions take the 
form of phagocytosis, digestion, excretion, and mitosis. The key feature of eusemio-
sis is the capacity of agents to perceive and recognize objects. Organisms with a 
minimal mind are not solipsistic and experience the internal and external world in 
the form of objects and parts that can be explored and manipulated. In the terms of 
von Uexküll, these organisms have both an Innenwelt (inner subjective world) and 
an Umwelt (outer subjective world) (Tønnessen, 2019: 419). With their capacity to 
perceive and manipulate objects, eusemiotic organisms have closed, complete func-
tional circles in the sense of von Uexküll (1982 [1940]).
An example of an eusemiotic sign relation is illustrated by the perception of prey 
tracks by a fox (Fig. 7.2b). The animal agency is represented by both the inner and 
outer components of a subjective world: an Innenwelt and an Umwelt, respectively. 
Animal perception is substantially more complex than sensing in bacteria. Animal 
senses generate a large number of signals (e.g., visual and olfactory), which are 
processed individually (i.e., without summation) and become organized into a sen-
sory input pattern. Then, the sensory input pattern is recognized by a fox as ‘animal 
tracks’, which is an immediate object.17 Here, animal tracks play two distinct roles: 
16 Here ‘encoded’ means making a sign that is interpreted by some subagent in the cell.
17 This term of Charles Peirce is explained in Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: “The first 
effect of Peirce’s greater appreciation of the parallels between inquiry and his sign theory is a 
distinction between the object of the sign as it we understand at some given point in the semiotic 
7  Semiosis

as a sign vehicle and as an object. The recognition of the object leads to the first 
interpretant, which is a mental motivation for further exploration. The fox continues 
interacting with the same object and eventually recognizes it as ‘rabbit tracks’. The 
updated idea of the object is then interpreted as a motivation to search for a rabbit 
(the second interpretant). When a rabbit appears in the visual field, it plays the role 
of a sign that is recognized as a rabbit-object and updates the idea of the actual rab-
bit. An interpretant of this sign (the third one) can be a plan for hunting the rabbit. 
Such interpretation processes belong to the Umwelt (i.e., outer phenomenal world), 
whereas habits belong to the Innenwelt.
The main differences of eusemiosis (e.g. fox hunting) compared to protosemio-
sis (e.g. bacterial chemotaxis) are: (i) in eusemiosis, signs are sensed not as lone 
signals but as patterns in large sets of signals associated with an object; (ii) the 
sensorial pattern is recognized as an external object of a specific type (this implies 
categorization); (iii) the agent keeps interacting with the same object while reveal-
ing additional features, updating percepts, and double-checking its recognition of 
the object; and (iv) the perceived object can be associated with another object (that 
is not necessarily perceived), and the agent can generate a new interpretant that 
motivates it to search or follow the associated object with the help of other sign 
relations.
A sign can refer to an object in various ways, such as by similarity, by being a 
part (or feature) of an object, or by being caused by an object (e.g., smoke as a sign 
is caused by fire as an object, and rabbit tracks (signs) are made by a rabbit (object)). 
A sign relation can also exploit a correlation between a sign and object in space and/
or time. For example, the tracks after a rabbit make a path that can be followed to 
find the rabbit. In other cases, a sign carries no clue to guess the object, and then the 
connection between sign and object is set by convention or habit. In the case of 
human symbols, the reference to objects is merely a sort of conceptual pointing to 
our previous experience with this type of objects.
Mental activity that brings the idea of an object in response to a sign is a part of 
the interpretation process. Naturally, there is a question, why the object is not 
counted as a result of interpretation, i.e., as a component of interpretant. Peirce’s 
triadic sign relation is grounded in his elaborate metaphysics. This is how El-Hani 
et al. (2008: 88–89) describe it:
Peirce conceives a ‘Sign’ or ‘Representamen’ as a ‘First’ which stands in such a genuine 
triadic relation to a ‘Second’, called its ‘Object’, so as to be capable of ‘determining a 
Third’, called its ‘Interpretant’, to assume the same triadic relation to its Object in which it 
stands itself to the same Object (CP 2.274. See also CP 2.303, 2.92, 1.541).
The interpretant is often treated “as the translation or development of the original 
sign [...] allowing us a more complex understanding of the sign’s object” (Atkin, 
2010). In the biosemiotic context, it makes sense to view the interpretant as a 
process, and the object of the sign as it stands at the end of that process. The former he calls the 
immediate object, and the later he calls the dynamic object.” (Atkin, 2010).
7.4  Sign Processes and Sign Relations

204
translation of the object in relation to the organism’s needs and habits. Hoffmeyer 
(2008a: 23) describes the following examples:
	(i)	 a sensory cell in the skin responds to applied external pressure and generates an 
interpretant in the form of a sequence of action potentials sent via nerve cells to 
the brain; and
	(ii)	 the sensorial input from a large number of receptors is recognized as a slap that 
is translated mentally as a sign of anger and aggression, which is an interpretant.
The object in a sign relation thus comprises static aspects of interpretation that 
represent the nature of the object as perceived by a certain agent (or type of agents), 
whereas the interpretant is a dynamic aspect of interpretation due to its dependency 
on the current goals of the agent and context of its activity. Because of context-­
dependency, the cognitive pathways of interpretation make a branching network, 
and additional signs are used for further selecting direction at each node. Although 
the object component of a sign relation is static in a particular sign process, it can 
change after evolution, organism development, or learning. In particular, it can be 
quite different for entirely unrelated organisms.
Sign relations can be dissected in more detail when necessary. In a classical 
example, where smoke is a sign of fire, the smoke is sensed by its attributes such as 
smell or visual appearance. Let’s focus on smell, since its mechanism is simpler. 
Before smell is perceived cognitively (i.e., via the brain), it is detected by receptors 
at the cellular and molecular levels. Specialized olfactory receptor cells are located 
in the epithelium on the upper surface of the nasal cavity (Fig. 7.3a). These are 
bipolar neurons with dendrites that carry many hair-like microscopic cilia extended 
into the mucus on the surface of the olfactory epithelium. The cilia carry receptor 
proteins anchored in the cell membrane, which become activated by specific odor 
molecules (Fig. 7.3b). Each receptor cell is specialized in sensing a specific odor, 
but there are many receptor cells responsible for detecting each odor type.
A minimal agent at the molecular level is a receptor protein anchored in the 
membrane of a receptor neuron. The receptor protein is a protosemiotic subagent 
which changes its three-dimensional structure (i.e., conformation) in response to the 
binding of an odor molecule (odorant), and this change is a sign that is interpreted 
by way of a cascade of molecular-level events. First, the enzyme adenylyl cyclase 
becomes activated, and it starts converting ATP into cyclic-AMP (cAMP) (Fig. 7.3b). 
Molecules of cAMP is a downstream signal that triggers opening of cAMP-gated 
sodium channels, letting sodium ions move into the cytosol and causing the depo-
larization of the cell membrane. If depolarization is strong enough, it initiates a 
propagating wave of action potential that travels along the axon to synapses con-
necting a receptor neuron with the dendrites of mitral cell neurons in the olfactory 
bulb (Fig. 7.3a). Then, mitral cells pass neural signals to the brain. All steps in this 
cascade are protosemiotic interpretations that do not include any reference to the 
object (an odorant molecule). The reference to a larger object (smell of smoke) 
comes only later by interaction with mental memory at the cognitive level. This 
example shows that cognition is supported by protosemiosis at the level of sub-
agents, such as protein receptors, receptor cells, and mitral cells. These subagents

do not “know” the cause of their activity and its final purpose, but they reliably fol-
low their goal-directed routine, which is imprinted in their genome. The results of 
their activity are interpreted by cognitive subagents in the brain and involve 
eusemiosis.
In contrast to bacteria, eukaryotic cells can establish analogs of dicisigns that 
encode connections between distinct subagents and their functions, as hypothesized 
by Stjernfelt (2014). For example, neurons cells connect to each other via synapses

activates adenylyl cyclase. Adenylyl cyclase converts ATP into cAMP, which opens cAMP-gated 
sodium channels. This leads to depolarization of the membrane, and if depolarization is strong 
enough it causes a propagating wave of action potential (i.e., electrical signal) that travels along the 
axon to synapses on the dendrites of mitral neurons in the olfactory bulb. Then, mitral cells pass 
neural signals to the brain

that play the role of dicisigns. Object perception and categorization seems to be 
essential for communication based on dicisigns because interacting agents should 
be able to recognize each other as objects and track the function of each other. We 
expect that natural dicisigns can be employed only by eusemiotic agents with a 
minimal or advanced mind.
7.5  Sign and Agency
Apparent circularity can be noticed in defining agents by their capacity to interpret 
signs, and also defining signs as semiotic instruments utilized by agents. The circu-
larity, however, can be explained in an evolutionary context. It appears that signs 
and agency are not just closely related concepts, but have common evolutionary 
roots. In particular, primordial molecular agents that emerged at the origin of life 
were self-interpreting agent-sign hybrids. But later in evolution, agential roles such 
as autonomy and teleology became separated from the signification functions of 
signs, which are mostly passive. Signs and agents have distinct roles18: signs inform 
agents (signify), whereas agents interpret signs and act. Signs, therefore, are not 
equivalent to agents, although some signs are also agents if these roles are combined 
as explained below. The role of agent is active and purposeful, and thus we consider 
it more important than signification. Meaning is grounded in agency, as has been 
proposed by Sergio Rodríguez (2016: 170):
In this way, in an agentive approach to meaning, grounding should be considered in relation 
to purposeful action: in order to understand meaning one must understand also how pur-
poses emerge, because meaning is purposefully driven.
The roles of agents and signs result from agent activity. The self-determination 
of agents does not imply a circular logic; instead it is a spiral, where agents build 
future agential roles of their own as well as of their progeny. Progeny organisms 
inherit some of their agential roles from parents and develop other roles through 
development, learning and imitation. The notion of ‘role’ is useful for avoiding 
confusion when a thing or system is named by its role. For example, a sunflower is 
a sign (index) pointing to the sun. Besides that, a sunflower plant is also an agent 
that grows, withstands environmental factors, and reproduces.
In a system hierarchy, agents are generally above signs in terms of complexity 
and control. For example, organisms carry a large number of diverse signs (e.g., 
genes, epigenetic traits, and mental states) that help them to organize activities at 
multiple structural and functional levels. Additionally, the body of an organism can 
play the role of a sign for other organisms – this sort of signification is important for 
ecological interaction between organisms. Besides signs, organisms carry multiple 
levels of subagents, specialized in performing various tasks ranging from interpret-
ing signs (e.g., sensors, signaling networks) to effector organs used for executing 
18 The role-based behavior of agency was emphasized by Tomáš Šalamon (2011: 105).
7  Semiosis

207
movement and other actions. Organisms obtain energy from food or solar radiation 
to support their activities and all components of organisms are elaborately inte-
grated to increase the efficiency and reliability of major vital functions. The agency 
is a dynamic functional whole, also called ‘organization’. It would therefore be an 
oversimplification to say that an organism is just a sign or a set of signs. Despite the 
fact that signs can change the activity of agents, it is the agent who is in charge of 
sign relations and not vise versa, because agents create and modify sign relations 
(Sharov et al., 2015).
Nevertheless, there are cases where agent and sign roles are so strongly inte-
grated that the units performing both roles deserve to be called agent-sign hybrids. 
Besides the primordial molecular agents mentioned above, agent-sign hybrids are 
abundant among molecular components of all living cells. For example, a protein 
kinase A (PKA) is an intermediate step in a signal transduction pathway that regu-
lates cell metabolism. The PKA is activated in response to sensing a stress hormone 
adrenaline (via sequential action of a membrane receptor, G protein, adenylate 
cyclase, and cAMP), and functions as a sign of stress. In liver cells, the PKA acts as 
an agent and a sign by phosphorylating its target proteins: acetyl-CoA carboxylase 
and pyruvate dehydrogenase, which become inhibited after phosphorylation. As a 
result, liver cells stop producing fat and switch to producing glucose, which is 
needed as energy for stress-response.
The majority of mental signs are passive memory states that are not agents. 
However, some memory states are active agent-sign hybrids represented by acti-
vated cognitive subagents. In particular, mental interpretants are not only signs for 
cognition but also active cognitive subagents that initiate chains of downstream 
interpretation and activity. For example, seeing smoke in a house activates the inter-
pretant of potential fire. Neurophysiologically, this interpretant is represented by an 
executive cognitive subagent (cognit) that starts planning emergency activity for 
triggering an alarm, escape, and rescue. Thus, a mental interpretant is more than a 
sign, it is also a subagent that starts interpreting other signs. A special case of down-
stream activity of a mental interpretant is the reproduction of the initial sign that 
caused its activation. Such signs, which are called ‘memes’, can hijack neighboring 
minds and proliferate within a human community like parasites (Dawkins, 1976). 
This idea is consistent with the teleological features of symbolic legisigns, which 
can be traced back to the theory of Peirce (1998 [1893–1913]: EP2.322, 1931–1958: 
CP2.222), as reported by Nöth (2014: 171, 177).
The interdependency of agency and signs should not threaten the importance of 
the notion ‘agent’ if the agential and signification roles are clearly separated. Thus, 
we neither reduce agents to signs nor signs to agents. Instead, we defend the neces-
sity to consider both notions: agency and sign, despite of their interdependency and 
partial overlap. In particular, we disagree with Peirce who reduced agency to signs:
It is that the word or sign which man uses is the man himself. For, as the fact that every 
thought is a sign, taken in conjunction with the fact that life is a train of thought, proves that 
man is a sign; so, that every thought is an external sign, proves that man is an external sign 
(Peirce, 1931–1958: CP5.314, italics original).
7.5  Sign and Agency

208
A thought is certainly important in human life, but human activities are not less 
important than thoughts. The ultimate value of a person is in her/his activity rather 
than in thoughts alone. We do not accept Peirce’s idea that agency is equivalent to a 
sign (“the word [...] is the man himself”). The primary human role is to be an agent 
with human capabilities, being a sign is a subordinate role. In the example discussed 
by Peirce, the agency is present not only in the whole organism (person) but also in 
the cognitive subagent (cognit) which represents the thought. Peirce prefers using 
the term ‘interpretant’ in a logical context as separated from the activity of neurons 
that empower cognition. In contrast, we assume that the interpretant is embodied as 
a cognitive subagent and has a dual role: as a sign for the person’s cognition and as 
a subagent for progressing neural processes.
Susan Petrilli (2013: 8) reinterprets Peirce in a biosemiotic way:
Peirce developed a semiotic approach to subjectivity, which means to say he redefined the 
self [i.e., agent] in a semiotic key: the self is a sign or, rather, a sign relation, therefore it 
cannot be conceived separately from sign material; the self converges with the verbal and 
nonverbal language it uses and is at once transcendent with respect to the latter.
In this statement, Petrilli does not insist that the ‘self’ is nothing more than a 
sign; instead she argues that agency has a semiotic nature and requires verbal and 
nonverbal communication. With this, we agree.
7.6  Sign and Information
The terms sign and information originate from different and somewhat incompati-
ble traditions. Signs are generally seen as carriers of mental meanings, whereas 
information theory as developed by Claude Shannon (1948) is focused on the 
mechanical transmission of signals (e.g., numbers or characters) over communica-
tion channels where errors are possible. This theory ignores the semantic aspects of 
communication, and instead measures the reliability of signal transfers. Assuming 
that each symbol is transmitted independently, the quantity of information is mea-
sured by the average reduction of uncertainty about the original message per symbol 
after receiving the message that passed through the channel. The theory of informa-
tion has been successfully applied to such fields as computer algorithms, encryp-
tion, and genetic code. Because the information theory deals with mechanisms, it 
became a symbol of the reduction of life and mind to computation (Dennett, 1991; 
von Neumann, 1966). It is particularly influential in molecular biology, where the 
DNA sequence is interpreted as genetic (or genomic) information. Donald Favareau 
(2010b: 29–30) assumes that the notion of gene as a functional unit of heredity was 
a predecessor of the concept of information. In contrast to human words, genes are 
not interpreted by mind, and yet, they are meaningful in the sense of affecting the 
phenotypic traits of organisms.
In the history of biosemiotics, there has been a period of rebellion against the 
notion of information, in an attempt to replace it with Peirce’s semiotics. For 
7  Semiosis

209
instance, Hoffmeyer (2008a: 61) wrote: “For an up-to-date biology must acknowl-
edge that the biochemical concept of information is just too impoverished to be of 
any explanatory use”. He criticized Jablonka (2002) for using the term ‘informa-
tion’: “even if Jablonka’s understanding of the information comes close to the 
biosemiotic concept of a sign, she strangely enough still thinks that it is important 
to preserve the notion of information as something that can be moved from one 
place to another” (Hoffmeyer, 2008a: 61). Søren Brier (2008: 435) associates infor-
mation with non-living systems, and separates it from signs and semiosis in living 
organisms: “information – as we use the concept in the sciences – is protosemiotic 
and tied to the level of formal causation. But that which is usually called ‘informa-
tion processes’ on the level of cells I acknowledge as sign processes or sign games.”
We agree with Brier (2008) that “information is not enough” if we want to under-
stand nature, but in a different sense than his. Instead of abandoning the notion of 
information in biology, as suggested by Brier and Hoffmeyer, we advocate a conver-
gence between the concepts of sign and information, and think that both of them are 
needed to characterize different aspects of biosemiosis. The notion of information 
can be applied to large aggregates of signs such as a genome, glossary, or database. 
In contrast to individual signs, these sources of information are seldom interpreted 
or manipulated in their totality. For example, the genome is handled as a whole only 
during cell division, whereas in non-dividing cells small segments of a genome 
(e.g., genes or regulatory units) are accessed and interpreted by many different sub-
agents (proteins) for mRNA synthesis and its regulation. The notion of information 
is also beneficial when applied to messages passed through a long chain of agents 
or subagents, such as in gene regulatory networks, neural networks, or phylogenetic 
lineages. In this sense, ‘information’ is similar to ‘meaning’ that is preserved in a 
sequence of passages or translations between agents. Giuseppe Longo (2020) 
emphasizes that information as a meaning carrier should be clearly distinguished 
from the formal elaboration and transmission of signs, i.e., information as theorized 
by Shannon (1948).
An important step towards integration of semiotics and information theory was 
taken with the development of semantic and pragmatic aspects of information. In 
particular, Bateson (1987 [1972]: 459) considered information “a difference which 
makes a difference” for an organism or some other agent. The first difference is 
perceived by an agent and represents the semantic aspect, and the second difference 
is the value of information and represents the pragmatic aspect (in the sense of 
James). To differentiate Bateson’s kind of information from Shannon’s kind, Eva 
Jablonka introduced the notion of biological information, which is characterized by 
(i) causing a specific reaction of the receiver, which is (ii) mostly functional and 
beneficial (i.e., selected in evolution or learned), (iii) where this reaction depends on 
the organization of the source rather than energy content or raw chemical composi-
tion, and (iv) the variation of the source of information (if present), causes consis-
tent variation in the corresponding changes of the receiver (Jablonka, 2002: 582). 
These conditions can also be used as criteria for a sign if the receiver is an agent. 
Note that Jablonka’s approach does not require knowing the mechanisms of 
7.6  Sign and Information

210
information processing – thus it represents a valuable approach for non-mechanistic 
studies.
One of the authors of this book has used a similar approach and applied the term 
functional information to all semiotic agents: “To preserve and disseminate their 
functions, agents use functional information – a set of signs that encode and control 
their functions” (Sharov, 2010: 1050). The term ‘functional information’ was inde-
pendently used by Csányi and Kampis (1985) and Fresco et al., (2017). In the latter 
paper it was applied to phylogenetic and ontogenetic learning processes, which are 
based on two components: exploration and selective stabilization in a receiver 
organism. The taxonomy of ‘difference makers’ (i.e., elements of functional infor-
mation) proposed by Fresco et al. includes cues, signals, natural, and non-natural 
information (ibid.).
Queiroz, Emmeche, and El-Hani approach the theory of information from the 
position of Peirce’s semiotics. They describe Peirce’s triadic sign relation (Sign – 
Object – Interpretant) as “a triadic process of communication of a form from the 
object to the interpretant through sign mediation” (Queiroz et  al., 2008: 79). 
Following Peirce, Queiroz et al. do not include the interpreter (or agent) in the sign 
relation; but they acknowledge that the interpreter’s behavior is constrained by 
semiosis: “the form — as a regularity embodied in the object — constrains the inter-
preter’s behaviour through the mediation of a sign” (ibid: 81). Queiroz et al. apply 
their terminology to the notion of biological information (Jablonka, 2002) and to 
genes. They interpret Jablonka’s ‘source’ of information as an object and the effect 
upon the receiver as an interpretant (Queiroz et al., 2008: 85). In contrast, biologists 
usually associate the source of information with a sign vehicle rather than with 
object (Bruni, 2008; Hoffmeyer, 1996, 2008a). In another example, El-Hani et al. 
(2008:124) consider the DNA sequence of a protein-coding gene as a sign rather 
than object, which seems not consistent with the terminology of the same authors in 
(Queiroz et al., 2008: 85).
An obvious sign of progress is that many philosophers now recognize the impor-
tance of semantic and pragmatic aspects of information and do not consider it as 
something that is purely non-mental and mechanistic. In contemporary literature, 
information is often presented as knowledge (in a wide sense) obtained from obser-
vations, experiments, or data, no matter how it is stored (e.g., in the brain, genome, 
a book, or computer) (Rowley, 2007). However, the convergence we call for between 
the concepts of sign and information is still incomplete. Bateson and Jablonka both 
recognize semantic and pragmatic aspects of information, but they avoid using 
semiotic terms. Queiroz et al. consider information as a semiotic process, but they 
do not apply the notion of agency and insights from Jamesian pragmatism. We 
believe that closing the conceptual gap between information and semiotics requires 
a biosemiotic approach based on the idea of semiotic agency (Tønnessen, 2015: 125).
7  Semiosis

211
7.7  Protosemiosis: No Perception of Objects
The rest of the chapter offers systematic descriptions of main levels of complexity 
of semiosis in various agents. As discussed above, semiotic theory has mostly been 
developed for studying human cognition and, to some extent, the behavior of sen-
tient non-human animals (i.e., animals with a brain). A more general approach that 
considers levels of semiosis in all organisms was developed by Terrence Deacon 
(1997), and more recently by Kalevi Kull (2009). Both relate the types of semiosis 
to Charles Peirce’s classification of signs. In particular, Kull distinguishes between 
vegetative, animal, and cultural types of semiosis, which are presumably based on 
iconic, indexical, and symbolic signs, respectively. An earlier version of this clas-
sification was proposed by Thure von Uexküll (1986). It was also inspired by the 
Aristotelian classification of souls into nutritive, sensible, and rational types. 
According to Kull, vegetative semiosis is not limited to plants but occurs at “the 
cellular and tissue level of most groups of organisms” (Kull, 2009: 15), including 
bacteria, protists, and fungi. The terms “vegetative” and “animal” are reminiscent of 
phylogenetic branches of plants and animals, though they are not directly connected 
to these. For example, many lineages of simple animals are not capable of associa-
tive learning (Ginsburg & Jablonka, 2019), and therefore do not qualify for animal 
semiosis in Kull’s conception.
The main problem with this approach is in our judgement in the concept of veg-
etative semiosis, which according to Kull is based on iconic recognition. Peirce 
distinguished between icon, index, and symbol based on the relation of a sign with 
its object, where this association is processed by an interpreting mind. But molecu-
lar subagents in living cells that perform vegetative functions do not perceive objects 
and have no interpreting mind. Thus, Peirce’s term ‘icon’ may not be relevant for 
metabolism and other vegetative functions. Accordingly, we suggest replacing the 
concept of vegetative semiosis with an entirely different concept, namely that of 
protosemiosis, which was first proposed by (Prodi, 1988a). In this view, molecular 
subagents interpret signals (proto-signs) as actions, bypassing a reference to objects 
(Sharov & Vehkavaara, 2015).
In comparison, Peirce considered analogs of mind and semiosis in mechanisms, 
such as a thermostat, and called them ‘quasi-mind’ and ‘quasi-semiosis’ (Nöth, 
2002: 84–85). We do not use these notions, because Peirce applied them in the con-
text of panpsychism and hylozoism, which are in our view incompatible with biose-
miotics. For example, Peirce wrote: “Thought is not necessarily connected with a 
brain. It appears in the work of bees, of crystals, and throughout the purely physical 
world” (Peirce, 1931–1958: CP 4.551). Søren Brier and Cliff Joslyn (Brier & Joslyn, 
2013: 144) succinctly remark:
The biosemioticians who hope that Peircean pragmatic semiotics can act as a new and suf-
ficient paradigmatic framework have to face his three categories and “phaneroscopic” 
ontology of emptiness, combined with his hylozoist view of matter and mind and his 
Agapistic integrative view of science and religion.
7.7  Protosemiosis: No Perception of Objects

212
By using the term ‘protosemiosis’ instead of ‘quasi-semiosis’ we mean to avoid 
confusion with Peirce’s controversial metaphysics.
As discussed above, protosemiotic agents, such as bacteria, do not perceive 
objects around them. Bacterial chemoreceptor proteins do not provide information 
on what glucose is. Thus, the meaning of a downstream sign (e.g., secondary mes-
senger) is not the presence of glucose but the fact that the chemoreceptor protein has 
changed its conformation. Bacteria can sense external objects with their protein 
appendages: flagella and pili (Ellison et al., 2017; Hug et al., 2017), but the result of 
this sensing seems to be limited to making a distinction between a touch and no 
touch; we have found no evidence that it provides information about the object itself.
According to Bruni (2008), stereochemical key-and-lock binding of a signaling 
molecule to a protein receptor is an example of categorical sensing, where a digital 
output is produced from the analog input of a spatial pattern. We consider this pro-
cess as entailing detection rather than recognition or categorization of a signaling 
molecule, because protein receptors do not provide information on the nature of the 
outside object. Such misunderstandings can be traced back to Prodi (1988a, cited 
from Favareau, 2010a: 329) who wrote:
In philosophical terms, an enzyme is a reader that ‘categorizes’ reality determining the 
ensemble of all the molecules which can factually react with it. The term category is used 
here both in a Kantian sense (a ‘point of view’ of a reader who gives order to the world) and 
an Aristotelian sense (the objective ensemble of things presenting a given character).
We think that comparison with Kant and Aristotle is not relevant in the case of 
protosemiosis, because they both meant human perception and categorization, 
which is eusemiotic.
Notions of recognition and categorization are relevant only for those analog-to-­
digital transitions where the analog pattern is already internalized by an agent via a 
large number of receptors whose output signals are processed separately, as in the 
case of visual or tactile perception in animals. Separate processing is necessary for 
detecting specific patterns in signals coming from large sets of spatially distributed 
photoreceptors or tactile receptors. In contrast, in bacteria, signals originating from 
multiple receptors of the same kind are not processed separately. They are simply 
summed up and the downstream action is initiated if the cumulative signal exceeds 
a certain threshold (Bruni, 2008). Threshold-based interpretation of signals can be 
called “categorization” in the sense of selecting a category of action to be initiated 
when the threshold is reached. But this does not involve any categorization of out-
side objects. In other words, signal-processing networks in bacteria do not support 
the analysis of complex sensorial patterns, which is necessary for perception and 
recognition of objects.
If an organism can perceive objects (as in eusemiosis), it can also be expected to 
choose how to interact with a specific object. The decision of a bacterial cell to 
move during chemotaxis, in contrast, is based on a cumulative signal from many 
chemoreceptors that are bound to different molecules of glucose. The cell reacts to 
the average ambient concentration of glucose rather than to a specific object such as 
an individual molecule.
7  Semiosis

213
Perhaps the most complex interaction of bacteria with external objects is conju-
gation, when two bacteria exchange a portion of their genetic material in the form 
of a plasmid (Ryan & Ray, 2004: 57–64). If bacteria could perceive their conjuga-
tion partner as an object, we would expect that the interaction between cells could 
be aborted actively if the partner showed unexpected properties. Abortion of inter-
action should not be confused with the malfunction that occurs when the process is 
stalled or terminated due to factors that are not likely to be products of adaptive 
evolution or learning. So far, we have not found any evidence that bacterial conjuga-
tion includes perception.
An important instance of protosemiosis is the processing of nucleic acids, such 
as DNA replication, mRNA synthesis, and protein synthesis. In these processes, 
intra-cellular subagents (e.g., proteins, ribozymes, or riboproteins) make new mac-
romolecules by a sequential processing of other macromolecules that are used as 
templates. These semiotic processes belong to protosemiosis because they are based 
on simple syntax rules (or codes) which are applied sequentially and do not involve 
any recognition (categorization) based on internal models. Macromolecules are pro-
duced but not perceived as objects by cells and their subagents.
Nucleic acids have evolved for storing hereditary signs rather than for perception 
of external reality. These two functions tend to be mutually exclusive, because per-
ception requires high sensitivity to external signals, whereas heredity requires a 
minimum of external disturbance. Therefore, the DNA sequence is well isolated 
from the outside world. But some disturbances of the bacterial genome are allowed, 
under strict control by cell subagents. Most of these disturbances are limited to 
recombination with a plasmid or insertion of small fragments of viral DNA into the 
immune genes known as CRISPR loci (Barrangou & Marraffini, 2014). These pro-
cesses can be confused with perception because they create an internal copy of the 
DNA from external agents. But as we argued above, DNA copying is based on 
sequentially applied codes and does not meet the criteria for perception since there 
is no model-based recognition of objects.
Although we have not found any evidence of eusemiosis in bacteria, it is con-
ceivable that future studies might show that some bacteria have elements of object 
perception that satisfy the criteria for eusemiosis. If that turns out to be the case, it 
is unlikely that such processes are present in all bacterial species. It would thus 
remain a fact that at least some species of bacteria are fully protosemiotic. This in 
turn proves that life is possible without the perception of objects.
Although protosemiotic signs are primitive, in the sense of involving mechanis-
tic interpretation and lacking a reference to objects, they can be assembled into 
complex networks that regulate cellular functions. As an example, let us consider 
the assembly of actin filaments in eukaryotic cells (Sharov, 2017). Actin is an abun-
dant protein that makes the cytoskeleton via polymerization into long fibers. It 
emerged in evolution for a specific purpose: to make flexible filaments that can be 
easily assembled, disassembled, and integrated into the cytoskeleton of cells. These 
filaments control cell shape and allow crawling over a surface (Lodish et al., 2000). 
Actin is a polarized molecule with its (+) end generally fitting by its shape and 
charge to the (−) end of another actin molecule, a feature which allows them to bind 
7.7  Protosemiosis: No Perception of Objects

214
to each other specifically. The assembling of actin proteins into a filament is more 
than a chemical reaction of polymerization, because it is controlled by various sig-
nals. Actin monomers readily bind to the terminal actin molecules in a fiber, but not 
to free-flowing actins. This means that an attachment of actin to the filament makes 
a signal for binding of the next actin molecule. The signal travels along the filament 
at the tip of its growth and results in the construction of the full filament (Fig. 7.4).
The polymerization of actin is controlled by its interaction with additional sig-
naling molecules. Actin protein has a special “pocket” in its three-dimensional 
shape that fits exactly to the ATP molecule. Specific binding of ATP changes the 
shape of the protein and unlocks its capacity to become attached at the growing (+) 
end of the filament (Lodish et al., 2000). Thus, actin filaments cannot grow without 
ATP. Actin protein acts as an agent when it binds to the tip of a filament, and binding 
takes energy in the form of ATP, which is hydrolyzed to ADP immediately after 
incorporation of actin monomer into the filament. Dissociation of actin occurs at the 
(−) end of the filament, which results in a “treadmill effect”. Tropomodulin protein, 
however, caps actin polymers at the (−) end and prevents dissociation of monomers. 
Another protein, CapZ, caps actin filaments at the (+) end and inhibits polymeriza-
tion. Initiation of new actin filaments (or new branches of existing filaments) is 
controlled by the Arp2/3 complex of proteins.
Several other proteins regulate the assembly of actin filaments. For example, 
cofilin binds to ADP-bound actin monomers (i.e., products of filament disassembly) 
and keeps them in the ADP-bound form, preventing reuse in polymerization. Profilin 
reverses this effect by facilitating the exchange of actin-bound ADP for ATP. As a 
result, actin monomers dissociate from cofilin and become available for the assem-
bly into filaments. Polymerization of ATP-actin monomers can be inhibited by thy-
mosin beta which specifically sequesters ATP-bound actin. All these regulatory 
proteins emerged in evolution and in effect allow cells a full control of their cyto-
skeleton in order to crawl on the surface, change their shape, and establish contacts 
with neighboring cells.
Protosemiosis is based on automated sign processing, and thus resembles com-
putation, which is often viewed as a non-semiotic process since computers cannot 
capture the meaning of signs. Umberto Eco (1976) excluded molecular processes 
from consideration in semiotics. Marcello Barbieri (2008: 594) wrote: “A computer 
contains codes but is not a semiotic system”. However, there is no theoretical reason 
why semiosis cannot be automated, as long as semiotic agency is involved. 
Automated processing of signs is common in living organisms. Simplicity and 
speed are the main advantages of automated responses. Automated sign processing

in protosemiosis should not be neglected in biosemiotic theory (Sharov & 
Vehkavaara, 2015).
Protosemiotic organisms, such as bacteria, cannot perceive objects and their 
interaction with the outside world is limited to sensing and reacting to signals. 
Bacteria interact transiently with external molecules and macro-objects via sensors 
and appendages and receive signals that result from these interactions. In contrast, 
eukaryotic cells have long-lasting, complex interactions with objects such as sym-
bionts (mitochondria, chloroplasts), stress granules, cargo vesicles, external parti-
cles, and neighboring cells, and actively collect relevant information about these 
objects. It is therefore conceivable that eukaryotic cells combine protosemiotic 
molecular signaling (used for regulating metabolism and signal transduction) with 
elements of eusemiosis, which is a higher-level type of sign processing that includes 
perception and recognition of objects. Eusemiosis does not in all cases require a 
nervous system or brain, but eusemiotic agents must have at least a minimal capac-
ity for object recognition (Sharov, 2013). The epigenetic system is far more devel-
oped in eukaryotic cells than in prokaryotes and provides extensive and dynamic 
rewritable memory which can be involved in object perception and recognition. We 
consider the transition to eusemiosis as equivalent to the emergence of a minimal 
mind, which is likely to have accompanied the eukaryotic transition (Fig. 7.5).
7.8  Eusemiosis: The Emergence of a Minimal Mind
Mind is mostly known as a human faculty which is responsible for conscious expe-
rience and intelligent thought. Components of the human mind include perception, 
memory, reason, logic, modeling of the world, motivation, emotion, and attention 
(Premack & Woodruff, 1978). This list can easily be expanded to other kinds of 
human mental activities as well. Defects in mental functions (e.g., in logic, atten-
tion, or communication) are considered as a partial or complete loss of the faculty 
of mind. In short, mind is traditionally seen as a collection of human mental func-
tions. However, this definition tells us nothing about the nature of mind. Human

216
mental functions are so diverse that it is difficult to evaluate their relative impor-
tance. The best way to identify the fundamental components of mind is to track its 
origin in primitive organisms. The mental activities of animals are similar to human 
cognition in many aspects, for instance by involving perception, memory, modeling 
of the world, motivation, and attention (Griffin, 1992; Sebeok, 1972). Truly abstract 
reasoning is likely only found in the most cognitively complex animals (though 
reasoning in the form of making inferences is a more widespread phenomenon). 
This indicates that human reasoning and rationality is not a fundamental element of 
mind, but rather a late, advanced addition to the variety of mind.
The existence of mind in animals is now generally accepted among biologists 
(Ginsburg & Jablonka, 2019; Low et al., 2012). However, several difficult questions 
remain unanswered. For example, where is the lower evolutionary threshold for 
mind? Does mind require consciousness? For these reasons, it is necessary to define 
what a minimal mind is. Here we assume that a minimal mind, the simplest or most 
basic mind possible, is a tool for recognizing objects that is based on the interpreta-
tion of complex sensorial patterns (as well as sensorimotor interactions). This con-
trasts with direct responses to one or few signals, as in protosemiosis. As discussed 
above, the origin of mind marks a transition from protosemiotic agents, where signs 
directly control actions, to eusemiotic agents, where signs are associated with 
objects. Carl Pantin (1956: 588) described this transition in the following way:
The really important first step in the evolution of advanced behaviour is the replacement of 
simple stimuli or simple patterns of stimulation for the genesis of behaviour, by an abstract 
model of objects in the real world — that same real world of objects with which our own 
naïve realism endows the world. The ant reacts to stone and so do we, rather than reacting 
to the very different initial sensory inputs by which these are detected by ants and men.
Here we examine the main principles of object recognition (i.e. token-type asso-
ciation), using visual perception as an example. Obviously, eusemiosis did not start 
with vision, which emerged much later, but vision is a useful example for explaining 
how minds work. The recognition of objects is dynamic and based on the conver-
gence of a multidimensional sensorial input in the mental phase space to one of the 
mutually exclusive meta-stable states (or regions), also known as attractors 
(Fig. 7.6). Recognition of visually perceived objects can be split into four steps. The 
first step is sensing, and involves photoreceptors capturing small portions of the 
image and sending their signals to the brain. At the second step, the visual field is 
partitioned into objects using color and contrast as boundaries, and one of the 
objects is selected as a focus of interest. At the third step, signals related to the 
object are integrated and projected to the multidimensional mental state, which rep-
resents the initial perception (i.e., mental impression) of the object (cf. the straight 
gray arrows in Fig. 7.6). This roughly corresponds to what von Uexküll (1957: 375) 
called a ‘perceptual image’. Finally, the fourth step involves the internal dynamics 
of mind along a trajectory that starts with the perceptual image and converges to one 
of the attractors representing the type of object (i.e., categorical perception). Each 
attractor represents a discrete (i.e., digital) meaningful category (e.g., a fruit, tree, or 
predator), and reaching an attractor implies the successful recognition of an object. 
7  Semiosis

217
In this case, the mind works as a classifier that identifies the type of an object based 
on complex sensorial data.
For simplicity, we assume that all sensorial information is acquired before send-
ing it for mental processing. In real life, however, organisms usually recognize 
objects dynamically, and sensing is not separated in time from mental processing 
but runs in parallel. Mental trajectories are thus not fully autonomous, but can be 
adjusted by additional sensorial input which is generated while an organism contin-
ues interacting with an object. In an ideal situation, the result of object recognition 
does not change after another round of exploration. But in some cases, object rec-
ognition fails when trajectories that start in different initial perception states do not 
converge towards the same attractor. Then the result may depend on what features 
of the object are handled first (as in the parable on blind men exploring an elephant).
This model shows that sensing alone is not sufficient for object recognition. 
Organisms need to combine sensing with internal mental models – in this case a set 
of attractors in the mental phase space. The importance of mental models in percep-
tion was advocated by von Uexküll (1957) and also by Kenneth Craik (1943). 
Learning about a new kind of objects requires changes in the mental model, to 
accommodate for an additional attractor. The main epistemological problem with 
the mental models of animals (and humans) is that they are not directly accessible 
for measurement, and thus remain hypothetical. The relationship between inferred

attraction used for recognizing objects. Gray straight arrows point to perceptual images, which are 
mental proxies of initial visual perceptions/impression of objects; black curved arrows show the 
mental dynamics that lead to one of the attractors (red dots); reaching an attractor is equivalent to 
object recognition (i.e., categorical perception). (Modified from Sharov & Vehkavaara, 2015)
7.8  Eusemiosis: The Emergence of a Minimal Mind

218
mental models and objective neurophysiological processes is not fully explored and 
can be case-specific.
From a physiological point of view, an attractor is implemented as a specific pat-
tern of neuronal activity, also known as a “brain-object” (Swan & Goldberg, 2010). 
However, these patterns of activity cannot be presented as a mechanism with prede-
termined parts and relations. Instead, recognition of objects activates a large number 
of semi-redundant signal-processing pathways, whose involvement changes from 
one instance to another. Thus, studying an isolated signaling pathway does not 
explain mechanistically how sensorial information is mapped to objects in each 
specific case (although it may be helpful for exploring potential mechanisms and 
designing pharmacological interventions to mediate problems related to vision). To 
explain perception, it is more meaningful to consider the convergence of mental 
state trajectories within attractor domains than to dissect individual signaling mech-
anisms and pathways.
In animals, the recognition of an object is often associated with relevant func-
tional actions, making a functional circle (Fig. 2.1) as defined by von Uexküll 
(1957). After an object is recognized, its type serves as an interpretant which from 
then onwards plays the role of a sign (occurring to the ‘central receptor’ in the inner 
world and processed by nervous system) that becomes associated with another sign 
(occurring to the ‘central effector’ and processed by muscles), after which the 
organism executes a certain behavior pattern that is either innate or learned. A sim-
ple example of a functional circle at work is found in the behavior of an eyeless 
tick,19 which awaits its prey (a deer or other mammal) hanging on vegetation with 
its legs spread out (Fig. 7.7). Ticks recognize their prey mostly by the smell of 
butyric acid (ibid: 7), which emanates from any mammal, as well as chemicals such 
as carbon dioxide and ammonia (Soares & Borges, 2012; van Duijvendijk et al., 
2017). In response to these chemicals (perceptual cues), ticks become active and 
either catch the hair of a moving animal or drop down on the animal’s body. This 
reflex is innate and does not require learning. Because ticks have no vision, they 
cannot develop visual representations of objects; instead they perceive prey by a 
smell pattern combined with a subsequent sensorimotor experience, such as attach-
ing to a prey and checking whether the surface of the prey is covered by warm hairy 
19 Some but not all ticks have eyes. Their vision is at any rate very limited.

skin. Ticks have no interest in (or need for) accumulating specific facts about their 
prey, only in identifying suitable prey (i.e., mammals). To achieve this, they only 
need to follow their innate routine step by step, and check the success of every 
action through the stepwise unfolding of their main functional circle. Representations 
generated in this process are not merely about the object (prey), but rather about the 
checkpoints in the tick’s functionally structured subject-object interaction.
If an organism intends to interact with an object, it needs a capacity to lock its 
interaction with that object. Locking interaction ensures that the organism directs 
its activity towards the same object that it has sensed and recognized. The simplest 
mechanism for locking interaction is via mechanical contact (e.g., by binding, 
engulfing, or holding). Among the most powerful methods of locking interaction 
with objects is visual tracking, which has been “invented” independently in lineages 
of both invertebrate and vertebrate animals. Visual tracking of objects can work at 
large distances, it thus allows animals to know their environment in depth and in 
detail. For instance, fish easily distinguish approaching prey species from predators, 
and act accordingly. Visual tracking can help no matter what moves: an object or an 
organism itself. It can also substantially augment the capacity of organisms to rec-
ognize objects – for instance, an organism can move around the object and discover 
new features that were not visible from the original point of view.
Another advantage of eusemiosis is that it supports mental goals and anticipation 
in organisms. Mental mechanisms similar to those that categorize external objects 
can be used for categorizing internal states and for evaluating them as favorable or 
unfavorable. This kind of self-categorization is useful for regulating behaviors and 
contributes to the animal’s cognitive and behavioral complexity. For example, a 
self-recognized hunger state activates food-searching or hunting activity, whereas a 
self-recognized danger state activates stress responses and escape movements. The 
search for a favorable self state is a basic form of anticipation.
An advanced type of eusemiosis is cognition, also known as consciousness, 
which is characterized by learning, acquired representations, attention, emotion, 
anticipation, and motivation. These capacities vary in their complexity; for exam-
ple, basic anticipation is limited to a search for a favorable self state (see above), 
whereas advanced anticipation also includes attention, emotion, and imagination. 
Cognition is typically present in sentient animals, i.e. animals with a nervous sys-
tem and a brain. As discussed in Chap. 4, we apply the term ‘learning’ only to rep-
resentational mental processes that involve relatively long-lasting adaptive changes 
in behavior, which are actively constructed and not innate. Because cognition facili-
tates the emergence or modification of sign relation, we discuss it systematically in 
Chap. 8 on Semiogenesis.

Semiogenesis
Abstract  Semiogenesis is the emergence of new or modified sign relations in 
agents. New sign relations emerge by way of the interpretive activities of agents and 
subagents in adaptive evolution, development, physiology, and behavior. The gene-­
centric concept of evolution needs to be replaced by an agency-centric concept. The 
genome may change passively and randomly, but agents’ interpretation of the 
genome is active and guided by the logic of agent functions. Natural selection can 
facilitate semiogenesis in evolution indirectly by increasing the share of organisms 
with strong semiogenic potential in lineages, as well as by genetic accommodation. 
Developmental and physiological adaptations emerge via adjustment of living func-
tions of individual organisms and their parts. Examples include the plasticity of the 
immune system, muscles, and other organs. Behavioral adaptations have reached 
high levels of semiotic freedom in animals with cognitive capacities, such as asso-
ciative learning, representational memory, anticipation, and emotion. Advanced lev-
els of cognition are characterized by unlimited associative learning, use of symbols, 
and rational thinking supported by intentionality, which represents a belief-desire 
coupling. Each new level of semiogenesis brings along qualitative changes that 
elevate the historical rate of increase of the overall semiotic complexity of agents.
8.1  Defining Semiogenesis
Semiotics has traditionally been focused on routine sign processes involving inter-
pretation and communication. Saussure explored the signifying functions of spoken 
words (signifiers) in language, which are associated with mental concepts or mean-
ings (signifieds), while Peirce, with a broader approach, studied how signs are inter-
preted in relation to objects. These sign processes belong to what we can call routine 
(or habitual) semiosis, because they are based on well-established sign relations 
(see Chap. 7). As Campbell et al. (2019: 354) remark, “the terms describing learning 
and cognition are mostly absent in the classic semiotic terminology”.
Another approach is studying the changes in sign relations, which is known as 
evolutionary semiotics (Cariani, 1998; Kull, 2014; Sharov, 2016b; Campbell et al., 

226
2019). Walter Koch applied this kind of approach for the analysis of the origin of 
language, art, and literature, and called it semiogenesis1 (Koch, 1982, 1984). We 
think that ‘semiogenesis’ is a better term for a phenomenon of sign relation emer-
gence or change than ‘evolutionary semiotics’ because sign relations change not 
only via biological evolution, but also by embryo development, animal learning, 
and creative activities in humans. One of the authors of this book has characterized 
semiogenesis as “the numerous instances and processes of semiotic causation2 [that] 
represent all we know as creativity and ingenuity, and much of what we recognize 
as novelty” (Tønnessen, 2012: 248).
The creative role of agents in the interpretation of signs is expressed even stron-
ger in Hoffmeyer’s notion of semiotic freedom which has been elaborated through a 
series of publications (Hoffmeyer, 1992, 1996, 2014). Hoffmeyer assumes that 
semiotic freedom is incompatible with physical determinism, and extends beyond 
quantitative mechanistic relations. This is central to our outlook. He wrote:
I opted for the expression semiotic “freedom” rather than semiotic “depth” in order to save 
giving the (false) impression that we are dealing with a quantitative term on a par with logi-
cal depth. My aim, in calling it semiotic freedom, is to establish the creative dimension of 
the semiosphere. (Hoffmeyer, 1996: 66)
In biology, the main aspects of semiogenesis are adaptation and adaptability in a 
broad sense, including knowledge and cognition. The term ‘adaptabiity’ covers 
meta-adaptations which generate or support a class of adaptations. Examples of 
adaptable systems are heredity (i.e., genes, chromosomes, mitosis, and epigenetic 
states), the body plan of animals (germ layers, gastrulation, skeleton, appendages 
and organogenesis), as well as patterns of morphological and physiological 
variation.
Although the term “semiogenesis” is relatively new, the historical and dynamical 
approach to semiosis has been widely explored in biosemiotics. Among the prede-
cessors of biosemiotics, it is necessary to mention Henry Bergson (1998 [1911]), 
who developed the concept of creative evolution, and Jakob von Uexküll, who 
emphasized the pivotal role that organisms have in developing their own meaningful 
relations with the environment. Von Uexküll (1926: 317) wrote:
the external world offers to the organism a certain number of properties separated in space 
and in time, from which to select, and there with the possibility of making a poorer or a 
richer surrounding-world [Umwelt]. But the external world itself takes no part in the selec-
tion, which has to be made by the organism without external assistance.
According to Carlo Brentari (2015: 60), von Uexküll, in contrast to Darwin’s 
idea of the primacy of environmental factors, considered organisms as active 
1 A similar term, semiopoiesis, has been proposed recently by (Dos Santos 2018).
2 The notion of semiotic causation was introduced by Jesper Hoffmeyer, who defined it as the 
“bringing about of changes under the guidance of interpretation in a local context” (Hoffmeyer 
2008: 149). In general, semiotic causation does not always imply semiogenesis as defined in this 
book; however in this context (i.e., creativity, ingenuity, and novelty), Tønnessen meant 
semiogenesis.

players in evolution, where behavior is mediated by the interpretation of various 
objects as meaningful. In our paper authored together with Timo Maran we (Sharov 
et al., 2015: 362) wrote:
Emphasizing the active role of organisms has crucial implications for understanding the 
dynamics of ecological and evolutionary processes. By altering sign relations, organisms 
are capable of influencing what and how they recognize and respond to, and what environ-
mental resources they make use of [...] Semiotic activity allows the organism to manipulate, 
to a certain degree, ecological factors that act upon it. The organism thus alters and 
­maintains its own ecological niche [...] Organisms reshape sign relations, and not only those 
sign relations that are under their own control, but also in other species. This is especially 
evident in parasitism, where parasites modify the behaviors of their hosts in a way that is 
beneficial for the parasite. For example, insects infected by virus or fungus often tend to 
crawl up on the vegetation, which facilitates the spread of the infection.
New sign relations usually emerge via modification or combination of already 
existing sign relations. Semiogenesis is therefore typically gradual. Novel interpre-
tation patterns need time for stabilization to become consistent with the long-term 
goals of an agent and its gradual accumulation of experience via trial and error.
Semiogenesis is not a universal feature of agents. It is, however, present in most 
primary agents (e.g., in organisms), and without it, life would never have emerged 
and evolved. Secondary agents (e.g., ribosomes, protein complexes, and computers) 
generally do not give rise to semiogenesis, except robots with AI, some of which 
display elements of behavioral semiogenesis. Most secondary agents persist and 
function by following a program supplied by parental primary agents.
8.2  Semiogenesis in Evolution
8.2.1  Adaptation Is a Biosemiotic Phenomenon
The most ancient type of semiogenesis is associated with adaptive evolution, which 
started with the origin of life and has continued in all lineages of organisms. 
Adaptation is one of the central notions in evolutionary theory, as well as in other 
fields of biology such as physiology, molecular biology, behavioral science, and 
ecology. In neo-Darwinism, adaptation is quantified by the effect of phenotypic (or 
genetic) change on the survival and reproduction rate of organisms. This is called 
fitness. Although this approach is useful for estimating the rate of phenotype (or 
genotype) turnover in a population, it is focused on the consequences of adaptation 
(i.e., survival and reproduction) rather than on adaptation itself.
In contrast, biosemiotics sees adaptation as a semiotic phenomenon, involving a 
meaningful relation between the structural and functional features of organisms and 
features of their environment. The term ‘adaptation’ also refers to the processes that 
produce adaptive relations between organisms and their environment. For example, 
eyes have emerged in animal evolution because the environment on Earth is illumi-
nated by the sun. In full darkness, eyes would not have evolved. The shape, size, and 
8.2  Semiogenesis in Evolution

internal structure of organs is optimized for successful functioning: legs are opti-
mized for walking and running, wings for flying, and eyes for seeing. The camou-
flage coloration of some animals helps them to hide and avoid being seen by 
predators. Adaptation is not fitness but fittedness – a relation between an organism 
and its environment. Hoffmeyer called it semiotic fitness: “The evolutionarily rele-
vant fitness concept, semiotic fitness, should ideally measure the semiotic compe-
tence or success of natural systems in managing the genotype-envirotype translation 
processes” (Hoffmeyer, 1997: 370). In particular, phenotypic traits are interpretants 
constructed by organisms via the interpretation of hereditary signs (e.g., genes and 
epigenetic profile) and environmental signs in order to be successful in performing 
their living functions. Because organisms include subagents, there are also internal 
adaptations, where the structure and function of each subagent is meaningfully 
related to other subagents and the external environment.
Organisms transfer adaptations to their progeny via self-reproduction, which 
involves supplying progeny with hereditary signs together with a minimal agency 
capable of interpreting hereditary signs and constructing the phenotype. 
Reproduction connects parental and descendent organisms into multi-generational 
lineages that survive much longer than individual organisms, and preserve most of 
their identity in a sequence of generations. “Heredity is semiotic survival”, as 
Hoffmeyer (1996: 24) succinctly wrote. This means that organisms keep their iden-
tity and adaptations via heredity despite of generation replacement.
Semiotic survival is based on the interaction between two heredity channels, 
which are informational and agential, respectively. Replication and transfer of DNA 
sequences represents only the informational component of reproduction, which by 
itself does not make another organism. An equally important channel of heredity is 
represented by agents that are capable of reading and interpreting genetic informa-
tion (Sharov, 2014) (Fig. 8.1). In order to guide the differentiation and movement of 
cells in a developing embryo, genetic information has to be interpreted by intra-­
cellular subagents and whole cells. These subagents are encoded in the genome, but 
this is not sufficient, cells require a set of actual physical subagents to interpret the 
genes (Sharov & Gordon, 2013). The epigenetic components of cells and multicel-
lular organisms are highly dynamic, and we therefore attribute them to the agential 
channel, along with necessary tools and scaffolds.
This concept of two-channel heredity explains how organisms preserve their 
morphology and functions across generations despite the fact that genes do not 
determine the phenotype. The concept has been envisioned by Hoffmeyer and 
Emmeche (1991: 127) in their paper on code duality, where they claim that life 
“needs at least two codes: one code for action (behaviour) and one code for mem-
ory – the first of these codes necessarily must be analog, and the second very prob-
ably must be digital” (italics original). Later Hoffmeyer elaborated on this concept: 
“Genes are not the only things handed down from one generation to the next. A 
highly complex cellular system, the egg, and an external environment are inherited 
by the organism” (Hoffmeyer, 2013: 150).
Many features of living cells are not genetically encoded (c.f. Griffiths, 2001). 
This includes all metabolic molecules (e.g., sugars, amino acids, nucleobases, 
8  Semiogenesis

229
coenzymes, and lipids). Neither is the genetic code (mapping of triplets of nucleo-
tides to amino acids) encoded in the genome, instead, it depends on aminoacyl-
tRNA synthetase molecules. Proteins can fold properly only in a very narrow range 
of physical and chemical conditions. These conditions are preserved by agents, and 
not encoded in the genome. In consequence, neither the three-dimensional structure 
of proteins nor their function is genetically encoded. A cell cannot restore many of 
its organelles if all their copies are lost. Examples of irreplaceable organelles are 
outer membranes, nuclear membranes, centromeres, mitochondria, plastids, and 
ribosomes. As we see, the agential channel of heredity is no less important than the 
informational channel, and genes alone do not determine the phenotype of organ-
isms, contrary to what is assumed in neo-Darwinism.
8.2.2  Emergence of Novel Adaptations
A common belief, namely that new adaptive traits appear in evolution by natural 
selection, is a myth. According to Darwin (1866), natural selection means nothing 
more than a change of phenotype frequency in heterogeneous populations. If organ-
isms with phenotype A have higher rates of survival and reproduction than organ-
isms with phenotype B, and these phenotypes are heritable, then after many 
generations, organisms with phenotype A will become more abundant than organ-
isms with phenotype B. The immediate effect of natural selection is in this view just 
population dynamics. For example, there is no new adaptation when some bacterial

cells die after antibiotic treatment, as other cells that happen to be resistant to anti-
biotics continue their growth and reproduction. Resistance has been detected even 
in cells that never encountered antibiotics (Wright, 2010). The theory of natural 
selection explains the spread of new adaptations in a population, but it does not 
explain their emergence (Wagner, 2014). Darwin assumed that adaptive heritable 
phenotypes can appear by chance, but he could not present any evidence for this. He 
wrote (Darwin, 1866: 157):
I have hitherto sometimes spoken as if the variations—so common and multiform in organic 
beings under domestication, and in a lesser degree in those in a state of nature—had been 
due to chance. This, of course, is a wholly incorrect expression, but it serves to acknowl-
edge plainly our ignorance of the cause of each particular variation.
In neo-Darwinism, which is also known as the Modern Synthesis (MS), the 
emergence of new phenotypes is explained as a direct consequence of mutations 
that gradually modify quantitative traits, and some of these phenotypes can be adap-
tive (Mayr & Provine, 1980). This approach is known as a gene-centric, and was 
inspired by the central dogma of molecular biology proposed by Francis Crick 
(1958, 1970), which claims that information is processed strictly one way from 
DNA sequence to the order of amino acids in a polypeptide, which is then self-­
organized into a functional protein. A logical extension of the dogma is the idea that 
the genotype determines the phenotype (Fig. 8.2a). According to von Neumann 
(1966), the process of phenotype construction is analogous to a cellular automata, 
which can construct any configuration from its description encoded in a linear string 
of symbols (analogous to nucleotides in DNA). This was called a universal con-
structor. All possible phenotypes of organisms are encoded by some DNA sequence, 
and therefore, in this view, novel phenotypes appear in evolution when a corre-
sponding DNA sequence is materialized via random mutations. Mutagenesis is con-
sidered an engine of evolution, and mutated genotypes are deterministically 
translated into phenotypes.3
Neo-Darwinism’s notion that mutations are the primary causes of evolutionary 
change is not supported by facts. There is no evidence of adaptive mutations in 
nature that modify the sequence of amino acids in a protein and appear beneficial 
immediately in natural undisturbed conditions. Such adaptive mutations would 
require at least one precise nucleotide substitution. Considering that the rate of 
mutations is very low – only 2.2 × 10−9 per base per year in mammals (Kumar & 
Subramanian, 2002), it would take thousands of years for an adaptive mutation to 
appear in a population. However, the time to adaptation arrival is critical, since 
populations are always in a condition of struggle for existence, a fact which was also 
emphasized by Darwin. If an adaptive mutation arrived after a thousand years, it 
would be too late, because either the population would already be extinct, or 
3 Here we present a radical version of the gene-centric approach and do not attribute it to any spe-
cific individual researcher. We are aware that many scientists who have worked within the neo-­
Darwinism paradigm have recognized its limitations and discussed alternative research approaches.
8  Semiogenesis

231
environmental conditions would have changed, so that the arrived trait would no 
longer be adaptive.
Another problem is that the gene-centric approach cannot explain the origin of 
molecular and developmental mechanisms that translate DNA sequences into phe-
notypes. The universal constructor (e.g., von Neumann’s) which makes the pheno-
type is not supposed to change. If changes are allowed, then the constructor is no 
longer universal, and its capacity to support all possible phenotypes can be ques-
tioned. In this case the phenotype may in fact depend more on interpretation mecha-
nisms than on the DNA itself, and in result, the gene-centric doctrine becomes 
jeopardized. But a universal constructor is at any rate too complex to emerge instan-
taneously in its final form.
The gene-centric approach has been criticized by biologists who advocate the 
importance of embryo development in evolution. This field of research is known as

subagents and whole organisms that interpret the DNA sequence and environmental signs. Genes 
play a supporting role by maintaining heredity and allowing genetic accommodation. The image 
of a fly is generated by the genotype builder. (Roote & Prokop, 2013)

“evo-devo” or the “extended evolutionary synthesis” (Pigliucci & Müller, 2010). 
According to Massimo Pigliucci (2008: 890), “several authors have hinted at the 
fact that the modern synthesis [MS] is not sufficient to account for evolutionary 
novelties, implying more or less forcefully that the MS is incomplete in some major 
respect”.
Pigliucci (ibid.) has provided a list of alternative explanatory principles that are 
important for evolutionary theory but ignored in neo-Darwinism. The first of them 
concerns complexity theory. It is well-known that complex systems have emergent 
dynamic properties and can undergo qualitative self-organizing changes. These fea-
tures explain phenotypic similarities in unrelated organisms and combinatorial pat-
terns of variation in taxonomic groups of different rank. Conrad Waddington (1957) 
used complexity theory to explain how epigenetic changes such as gene expression 
can affect differentiating cells and developing embryos.
The second principle is phenotypic and genetic accommodation, which was 
highlighted by West-Eberhard (2003). Phenotypic accommodation means the estab-
lishment of compensatory morphological, physiological, and behavioral changes in 
response to various disturbances, either external or internal. For example, many 
mammals can learn to walk on their hind legs if the front legs are damaged due to 
mutation or injury (West-Eberhard, 2003). The word ‘learn’ here implies more than 
just behavior, it also involves morphological and physiological changes. Some phe-
notypic responses can become a new norm if the range of plasticity (controlled by 
hereditary signs) is modified by natural selection; this phenomenon is known as 
genetic accommodation. Pigliucci (2008: 893) wrote: “The key point of phenotypic-­
genetic accommodation is that the genetic change follows, rather than precedes, the 
phenotypic change”. Similar ideas have earlier been developed by Ivan Schmalhausen 
(1949) and Conrad Waddington (1953).
The third principle concerns the existence of epigenetic inheritance, which trans-
fers information through a large number of cell divisions, and can preserve some 
adaptive traits of multicellular organisms between generations. In this way, epigen-
etic inheritance can facilitate genetic accommodation by providing more time for 
the action of natural selection.
Ideas developed within the extended evolutionary synthesis can be reformulated 
as postulating the primacy of agency in adaptive evolution. We propose replacing 
the gene-centric approach with an agency-centric approach that attributes adapta-
tion to the interpretive activities of organisms and their subagents (Fig. 8.2b). DNA 
has no meaning alone (i.e., without interpretation mechanisms), and a mutation has 
no evolutionary significance unless it is interpreted as meaningful. Mutations are 
disturbances that may trigger adaptations, but they are not adaptations in them-
selves. They can become adaptive only when they are followed by phenotypic 
accommodation, which is based on developmental and behavioral mechanisms of 
interpretation. This idea has been clearly formulated by Andreas Weber (2011: 149), 
who writes that “genetic instructions do not act as orders, but rather as perturbations 
being interpreted by an auto-maintaining developmental centre”.
As we see it, the roots of evolutionary adaptation are to be found in the interpre-
tation of hereditary signs and in the adaptive plasticity of organisms and their parts. 
8  Semiogenesis

233
This is a dramatic change of methodology for the theory of evolution compared to 
what neo-Darwinism offers. As an alternative to a concept of genetic determinism, 
we emphasize the semiotic role of organisms and their parts in acting as agents that 
creatively interpret hereditary signs and environmental sings. Phenotype building 
includes continuous adjustment and error correction, which provides semiotic feed-
back from the functional activity of the developing embryo. An organism, therefore, 
is not a zombie-like creature driven by genes, but a master agent that interprets 
hereditary signs in the context of biological functions and the local environment.
To achieve adaptation, organisms and their constituent parts need to monitor the 
results of living functions. This is assumed in the concept of the functional circle 
(von Uexküll, 1928, 1957). When problems arise, the adaptive response of the 
organism includes controlling the damage and attempting to restore the functions of 
the organism or cell by sending relevant regulatory signals. Accordingly, J. H. van 
Hateren has proposed a model of evolution which in addition to objective fitness 
incorporates subjective fitness, as it is perceived by organisms (van Hateren, 2015). 
Even simple organisms can take advantage of evaluating their subjective fitness, by 
increasing their functional and behavioral variability if their subjective fitness is 
low. In this perspective, the process of adaptation resembles the chemotaxis of bac-
teria: Starving bacteria initiate rapid movements (increasing variability of condi-
tions), and this helps them to find new sources of nutrients. But after arriving to a 
nutrient-rich area, the bacteria switch back to local slow movements. The model of 
van Hateren clearly shows that adaptation (and adaptive evolution) is semiotically 
driven, when it is mediated by the perception of one’s own fitness, and subsequent 
selection of activity.
The agent-centric approach resembles components of Lamarck’s theory because 
it assumes that acquired adaptations have a substantial role in evolution. But it is 
also compatible with Darwin’s idea of natural selection and does not contradict the 
facts of molecular biology and genetics. The genome may change passively and 
randomly, but its interpretation is active and guided by the logic of organism func-
tion and embryo development. The emergence of new functions can result from 
reinterpretation of the genome, in cases where old tools, resources, and control 
algorithms are adopted for novel purposes (Sharov, 2016a). Thus, the phenotypic 
saltation envisioned by Richard Goldschmidt (1940) appears possible, even if the 
genome changes gradually. Goldschmidt assumed that natural selection operates at 
two levels: in microevolution, it supports small quantitative adaptive changes (as 
assumed in neo-Darwinism), whereas in macroevolution, it can support rare qualita-
tive changes of a larger extent.
A well-documented case of adaptive evolution in a wild population is the change 
of wing color in the peppered moth in England. Originally, moths had white wings 
with dark speckles, a color pattern that helped them to hide from predators on the 
bark of white birch trees. However, after the industrial revolution, when birches 
became dark from soot, and light-colored moths sitting on the dark background 
became clearly visible to predator birds, this sign relation became non-adaptive. 
After a while, a dark form of the same species (called carbonaria) appeared in the 
polluted areas and soon became dominant (True, 2003) (Fig. 8.3).
8.2  Semiogenesis in Evolution

234
Dark coloration in moths is caused by pigment melanin, and it was therefore of 
interest to check if the change of moth phenotype was linked to melanin producing 
genes. A group of researchers from Liverpool led by Ilik Saccheri explored all 
known melanin-related genes, but found no association with the carbonaria pheno-
type (Van’t Hof & Saccheri, 2010). Later Saccheri’s team used a method called 
linkage analysis to pinpoint the genome locations that have the strongest association 
with the phenotype. The final search was narrowed down to a segment of 400,000 
base pairs in chromosome 17. All differences in this region were explored individu-
ally and only one gene called cortex turned out to be associated with the carbonaria 
phenotype. The gene was modified by a macromutation – an insertion of a transpo-
son, which is a virus-like DNA sequence capable of making its own copies in other 
genome locations (Van’t Hof et  al., 2016). But the mechanism of color change 
remains unexplained.
Many moth species have a capacity to change the wing color when adapting to 
new conditions, for example after moving to a new habitat. This means that the

235
peppered moth evolutionary episode could have been well “rehearsed” in the his-
tory of moth ancestors. The role of transposon insertion is likely equivalent to a 
nonspecific disturbance that triggered activations of an already existing internal sig-
naling pathway for changing wing color. In this example, the mutation is not an 
instruction to make dark wings, but simply a disturbance that was interpreted by 
developmental mechanisms as color change. This is a case of semiogenesis because 
a new phenotype is heritable, irreversible, and matches the ecological needs of 
moths. The adaptive value of the carbonaria form is somewhat accidental, because 
the new color could have been yellow or brown instead of black. But it could not 
have been red, green, or blue, because these colors are not supported by the devel-
opmental mechanisms of this kind of moths. It may be that the initial effect of the 
mutation was brown color, which was then adjusted by natural selection towards 
black color. This example shows that the mutation only served as a trigger of the 
internal agential response. The novel phenotype should be attributed to the 
moth’s agency.
The main advantage of the agency-centric approach is in the recognition of the 
organism’s subagents as autonomous and self-adapting units which are capable to 
modify their activities in response to various contexts within a cell. They are prod-
ucts of long evolution that has supported their goal-directed activities in line with 
cell regulatory mechanisms and regulatory signals from higher level agents. The 
communication between subagents has been developed by millions of years of 
coevolution.4 Subagents support not only high efficiency of individual functions, 
but also robustness, modularity, and fast adaptive response under emergency condi-
tions. These features would never emerge if evolution was driven by gene-centric 
mechanisms only. Moreover, subagents are multifunctional and can even perform 
additional activities for which they have not been designed by evolution. In other 
words, agents provide new evolutionary opportunities:
The ability [of bacteria] to develop resistance [to antibiotics] is based on the presence of 
multifunctional enzymes capable of degrading toxic molecules; it appears that only minor 
changes are required to adjust these enzymes for processing a new chemical. If bacteria had 
no enzymes to destroy toxic molecules then genetic variation would never yield antibiotic 
resistance. This example shows that variation is not random but depends on the presence of 
molecular tools that provide an opportunity for performing specific functions. Each molec-
ular tool not only performs a specific function in the cell but also adds a new dimension of 
additional or alternative functions that may appear in the future evolution. Thus, by expand-
ing the repertoire of molecular tools organisms can build up their evolvability and increase 
their chances of avoiding extinction and propagating in the long-term. (Sharov, 2014: 14)
This means that adaptive evolutionary changes originate from the plasticity of 
the existing parts of an organism, or in other words from the phenotype. The possi-
bility of a novel function arises from the multi-functionality of organism parts. Each 
organ, tissue, cell, or protein complex has many potential functions, including those 
4 The notion of coevolution is traditionally applied to a pair of interacting species, such as a preda-
tor and its prey (Abrams 1991). But here we use it to describe evolutionary dependencies between 
parts of an organism, which constitute partially autonomous subagents (see also Chap. 10).
8.2  Semiogenesis in Evolution

236
that have never been used. It is well known that human artifacts can perform func-
tions they were not designed for. For instance, a screwdriver designed to rotate a 
screw can also be used as a measuring device, a ruler, a lever, or a weapon. It is thus 
conceivable that organisms use their parts in similarly creative ways. Animals may 
use their legs, which evolved for walking, for swimming, object picking, or gliding 
in the air. Insect ancestors used their thorax appendages for gliding in the air, and 
these appendages later transformed into wings (Snodgrass, 2018 [1935]: 212).
The emergence of new adaptations in evolution somewhat resembles cognitive 
processes in organisms which helps explaining how organisms solve practical prob-
lems during their lifetime or in a sequence of many successive generations. The 
logical derivation of cognitive solutions is known as abduction, a term coined by 
Charles Peirce (1931–1958: CP 5.172). Eugenio Andrade (2011: 131) assumed that 
evolution is based on ‘natural abduction’, which “is the process through which 
organisms elaborate a possible response to environmental changing conditions by 
using all existing structural resources accumulated and selected along evolutionary 
processes”. He considers that abduction is a source of novelty in evolution 
(ibid: 133):
Neither induction, nor deduction, account for the origin of new hypotheses, in an analogous 
manner evolution cannot rely exclusively on blind chance exploration of the entire morpho-
space, and not either on deterministic definition of the right configuration. Instead, the ori-
gin of evolutionary variations depends on random biased search of a limited morphospace 
(the set of forms that are really attainable at a defined time in what Kauffman (2000, 
p. 197–219) defines as the “adjacent possible”). Likewise, abduction is based on selection 
of internal states (genetic and epigenetic) that function as representation of their external 
world, oriented by guessing and intuitions that lead to venture an alternative that can be 
right or wrong, in the former case there is survival in the second death.
Evolutionary adaptations of animals emerge not only from processes of organ-
ism development and phenotypic accommodation but also from their behavior. 
When animals learn new behaviors, their body parts become involved in new func-
tions, and these events may cause a systemic change of the relationship between 
genes and organism fitness; thus, evolution may take an entirely new direction. This 
effect was named after James Mark Baldwin (1896). Although the Baldwin effect is 
difficult to validate, it has been supported as a viable hypothesis by several evolu-
tionary biologists (Dennett, 2003; Depew & Weber, 1995). The Baldwin effect is an 
attractive hypothesis because it can explain the high rates of evolution in birds and 
mammals, which are generally the two most intelligent lineages of animals 
(Hoffmeyer & Kull, 2003). Behaviors can change very rapidly, even within one 
generation. They can therefore boost evolutionary rates by guiding the direction of 
evolutionary change (Sharov, 2016b).
Animal behavior can also affect evolution via niche construction (Odling-Smee 
et al., 2003). The niche is not only a product of evolution, a kind of ‘extended phe-
notype’, but also a factor that affects the direction and rate of evolutionary change. 
On one hand, “organism-driven changes in environments persist as a legacy to mod-
ify selection on subsequent generations” (Laland & O’Brien, 2010: 305); this effect 
is called ecological inheritance (Odling-Smee, 1988). Furthermore, emergent 
8  Semiogenesis

237
niche-construction traits can become heritable “by generating disequilibrium 
between niche-constructing alleles and alleles whose fitness depends on resources 
modified by niche construction” (Laland & O’Brien, 2010: 305).
As discussed, semiogenesis in evolution often results from the interpretative 
activity of organisms or their subagents (e.g., Baldwin effect or van Hateren effect). 
This phenomenon has been called semiotic selection (Maran & Kleisner, 2010: 191, 
italics original):
The term semiotic selection (sensu stricto selection because of semiosis) has therefore been 
proposed (Maran, 2008: 177) to embrace all phenomena where subject-specific 
­interpretation comes into play. The effect of semiotic selection can be suspected, for 
instance, in cases where there is a specific one-to-one correspondence between the percep-
tible characteristics of one animal and the perceptual organs of the other.
One of the special cases of semiotic selection is semiotic co-option, which
describes a situation when some feature, either novel or previously existing, that was shaped 
for serving a particular role or having a specific meaning within the Umwelt of an organism, 
is recognized as meaningful by another organism. (Maran & Kleisner, 2010: 196)
The evolutionary adaptations of animals and plants cannot develop gradually in 
their mature functional form, because neither whole organisms nor their constituent 
parts persist through multiple generations. Instead, they develop from scratch in 
every generation, via context-dependent interpretation of hereditary signs. This 
means that evolutionary adaptations are second-order sign relations that are built 
upon repeated interpretation of hereditary signs in every generation. As a result, 
evolutionary adaptation emerges from changes at two interdependent levels: fast 
adaptations occur in organisms and a slow adaptation occurs in the lineage. First, 
organisms interpret hereditary signs and the environment for the purpose of produc-
ing an adaptive phenotype, as well as adaptive physiological and behavioral 
responses (Fig.  8.4a, b). Then, surviving organisms reproduce and supply their 
progeny with copies of their hereditary signs, including genes. The success in sur-
vival and reproduction depends on the first adaptations (i.e., the phenotype and the 
responses of organisms), which represents semiotic survival. The progeny of organ-
isms that survived and reproduced have, in average, somewhat greater adaptation 
capacities than their parental generation (including those that did not survive till 
reproduction or did not reproduce). Changes of hereditary signs driven by semiotic 
survival get accumulated over a sequence of generations, and may eventually result 
in a substantial evolutionary (i.e., slow) adaptation (Fig. 8.4c).
8.2.3  Natural Selection
In the previous subsection we showed that evolutionary adaptations are rooted in the 
creative and context-dependent adaptive plasticity of organisms and their constitu-
ent parts. It appears that natural selection can facilitate this process indirectly, by 
increasing the numbers of organisms with a strong semiogenic potential in their 
8.2  Semiogenesis in Evolution

238
lineages. The current level of adaptation in organisms (which can be measured by 
relative fitness) is a good predictor of the semiogenic potential in the lineage in the 
future. This means that natural selection can facilitate future adaptations, because it 
increases the abundance of those organisms that are more likely to produce stronger 
adaptations in their progeny. Let’s assume that bacterial resistance to antibiotics is 
a quantitative trait, and that initially two genotypes are present: (A) which is par-
tially resistant to antibiotics, and (B) which is not resistant. If bacteria are not 
exposed to antibiotics, then both subpopulations, A and B, will reproduce equally 
well and some organisms may acquire mutations and epigenetic changes that either 
increase or decrease their resistance to antibiotics5 (Fig. 8.5, left). In the presence of 
antibiotics (at low concentrations), only a few bacteria with genotype B survive, 
whereas most bacteria with genotype A survive and reproduce faster due to lack of 
competition with genotype B (Fig. 8.5 right). The relative abundance of partially 
resistant bacteria (clone A), which are more likely to acquire mutations and epigen-
etic changes that facilitate resistance to antibiotics, is increased due to natural selec-
tion. After several generations in the presence of antibiotics, some organisms in 
5 Here, for brevity, we use gene-centric terminology as if a mutation is a physical cause of pheno-
typic changes. In reality, the causation is semiotic rather than physical, and mediated by interpreta-
tion mechanisms.

clone A display much higher levels of resistance than those in the same clone with-
out antibiotics.
Hoffmeyer (1996: 22) describes the process in semiotic terms: “the lineage inter-
prets the niche conditions as a sign of the demands that will be made on future 
generations. Using the reproductive pattern as its tool the lineage alters the DNA 
text, which is then passed on.” In our example, a niche condition is the presence of 
antibiotics, and heritable reproduction with modifications is a reproductive pattern. 
Of course, a lineage of bacteria has no mental capacities to anticipate that current 
niche conditions will persist and affect future generations in similar ways. Nor does 
it “know” that replicated DNA can help future generations to cope with the environ-
ment. Heritable reproduction with modifications is a semiotic mechanism that 
emerged in its most primitive form at the origin of life, and was then improved by 
natural selection. Improvements include increased robustness of the genetic code 
and protein synthesis to mutations (Wagner, 2011), regulation of the rate of muta-
tions, epigenetic regulation of gene expression and function, and epigenetic heredity.
The form of natural selection that causes gradual changes of quantitative traits 
directed towards higher levels of functionality and adaptation is called positive 
selection. The rate of change is generally slow and often requires hundreds or thou-
sands of generations to become observable. Positive selection can be explained by a 
model where the fitness of organisms (i.e., the rate of reproduction) is specified for 
each genotype or phenotype. To keep the model simple, we consider fitness, w, as a 
function of a single heritable quantitative phenotypic trait, x (Fig. 8.6). The function 
is assumed to be smooth because similar phenotypes have similar fitness. If the 
environment has been stable for a long time, organisms attain nearly optimal pheno-
types located at point A, where the fitness function reaches its maximum value. 
Because there is no gradient of fitness at the maximum point A, there is no positive 
selection and no evolution. Most mutations for organisms near point A do not pro-
vide any selective advantage and many of them are harmful. Hence, only purifying 
selection, which eliminates detrimental mutations, occurs. Purifying selection does

not contribute to semiogenesis, because it simply preserves existing interpretations 
of hereditary and environmental signs.
Now let’s consider a lasting change of the environment, such as a long-term 
drought or the disappearance of the main food resource. The fitness of organisms 
drops from point A to B and the maximum of fitness function appears shifted as 
shown by the dashed line in Fig. 8.6. Because the phenotype of organisms is now 
located on the slope of the fitness function (point B) and the phenotypic trait is heri-
table, positive selection would favor any random mutation that shifts the phenotypes 
uphill the fitness function. After many generations, the population can reach a new 
fitness maximum C. This simplified model is consistent with the mathematical the-
ory of natural selection (Price, 1970, 1972) in which the evolutionary change of a 
phenotypic trait is generally proportional to the covariance of the trait with fitness.
Although mutations are not the primary causes of adaptation, they are needed for 
stabilizing adaptive traits in evolving lineages, an effect known as genetic assimila-
tion (Waddington, 1953) or genetic accommodation (West-Eberhard, 2003). If new 
adaptations are not reinforced genetically, they are fragile, due to the low heritabil-
ity that results from being supported only by epigenetic mechanisms. These emerg-
ing adaptations can also suffer from poor coordination and lack of support from 
other functional systems in the organism. Genetic change via natural selection is 
therefore needed to increase the heritability and improve the performance of new 
adaptations. This requires non-specific random mutations, which occur every gen-
eration, and thus there is no long waiting time for them to appear. The same epigen-
etic state of a cell (e.g., gene expression profile) can be achieved in many alternative 
ways, mediated by various mutations. For example, the amount of protein produced 
by a gene can be changed by modifying transcription factor binding, chromatin 
modifications, alternative splicing, mRNA degradation rates, protein folding, inter-
ference through protein-protein interactions, protein modifications and degradation,

and so on. As a result, there are thousands of genome locations where mutations can 
change the expression of a gene. The idea of the phenotypic origin of adaptations 
followed by genetic accommodation was formulated as follows: “genes are follow-
ers not leaders in evolution” (West-Eberhard, 2003: 20), it has also been character-
ized as “phenotype first” (Palmer, 2004).
8.2.4  Systemic Patterns of Variation in Evolution
Biological evolution is a complex phenomenon, and it cannot be reduced to the 
tendencies towards adaptation discovered by Lamarck and Darwin. Besides adapta-
tions there are many other trends in evolution that also needs to be explained. Lev 
Berg (1969) viewed evolution as a “nomogenesis”, a process controlled by the laws 
of morphogenesis. Nikolai Vavilov (1922) discovered that phenotypically similar 
species of grasses often belong to several phylogenetically separated genera, which 
points to a common morphogenic potential in their evolution. He called them 
“homologous series in hereditary variation”. Sergei Meyen (1973) discovered that 
variation of plant leaves follow a clear pattern, as shown in Fig. 8.7. Possible modi-
fications include three basic types: (a) bifurcation at the end, (b) feather-like branch-
ing, and (c) palm-like branching, and some combinations. However, a bifurcation at 
the end of the leaf is never combined with feather-like or palm-like branching.
Meyen (1973) introduced the notion of a repeated polymorphic set (RPS) which 
is a generalization of Vavilov’s “homologous series in hereditary variation”. RPSs 
can be found in both inter-specific and intra-specific polymorphism. Examples of 
Fig. 8.7  Scheme of segmentation of leaves (up to the 2nd order of branching). (From Meyen, 1973)
8.2  Semiogenesis in Evolution

242
the latter type include adaptive plasticity, consequences of mutations, stress, and 
teratogenesis. Some RPSs represent variations of polymeric parts of organisms 
(e.g., segments of worms, plant leaves and hairs) or organ shapes at different stages 
of development. A similar notion of “the law of related deviations” was proposed by 
Nikolai Krenke (1933–1935). According to Krenke, abnormal morphologies, 
whether they are heritable or non-heritable, may closely resemble normal morphol-
ogies in evolutionary related species or genera. Abnormal morphologies may there-
fore uncover specific morphogenic capacities in organisms that can be also utilized 
in the evolution of related lineages.
Law-like patterns of variation have been studied in many kinds of animals. In his 
pioneering book On Growth and Form, D’Arcy Thompson (1917) showed that 
shapes of different kinds of fish follow the same plan and can be converted one into 
another by non-uniform stretching or shrinking (Fig. 8.8a). Boris Shvanvich (1949) 
identified the pattern of bands and eyespots on butterfly wings and its variation 
(Fig. 8.8b). From a semiotic point of view, RPSs are interpretants of developmental 
signs, and the emergence of new RPSs is an example of semiogenesis.
Based on the knowledge of the laws of polymorphism it is possible to reconstruct 
the formal ‘space’ of potential shapes, which is also called morphospace (Brakefield, 
2009). It includes shapes of currently existing and extinct species, as well as those 
shapes that never existed in organisms but may appear in the future. In this respect, 
David Raup (1966) proposed a formal model of all potential shapes of snail shells.
It is not fully clear why and how RPSs emerge in evolution. Polymorphic sets 
could appear as a byproduct of developmental adaptations (see Sect. 8.3), and in 
particular, as a result of epigenetic regulation (Waddington, 1957). If RPSs are uti-
lized for display, as it is in the case of butterfly wing patterns (Fig. 8.8b), they may 
facilitate communication between organisms, both within and across species. It is 
Fig. 8.8  Examples of the law of polymorphism: (a) – transformation of fish shape (modified from 
D’Arcy Thompson, 1917); (b) – prototype of the Nymphalidae wing pattern (left image) and its 
realization in various species of Erebia (right 4 images). (Modified from Shvanvich, 1949)
8  Semiogenesis

243
conceivable that such RPSs serve as a kind of syntax or grammar that have emerged 
via semiotic selection (in the sense of Maran & Kleisner, 2010).
Another explanation is that RPSs are means for increasing levels of adaptability 
in evolving lineages. Patterns of variation can represent what Kauffman (2014: 3) 
called “enabling constraints” that allow lineages to attain new adjacent possible 
adaptive states in evolution. If so, RPSs provide novel evolutionary opportunities 
for species: “Metaphorically speaking, regulated variation can be compared to hand 
rails on a narrow hanging bridge that provide an opportunity for a person to cross 
the river” (Sharov, 2014: 10). This hypothesis is difficult to verify, but it has been 
expressed in various forms by many biologists. For example, Lucien Cuénot (1914) 
described “preadaptations”, where “the structure of organisms often plays the lead-
ing role in evolution by narrowing down the set of new functions that can be acquired 
with the use of already existing structures” (Sharov, 2014: 11). Gould and Vrba 
(1982) has called this phenomenon “exaptation”. Gould and Lewontin (1979: 581) 
argue that evolutionary constraints may “become more interesting and more impor-
tant in delimiting pathways of change than the selective force”.
8.3  Adaptation in Development
The second level6 of semiogenesis is the embryo development and growth of multi-
cellular organisms such as animals and plants. The occurrence of semiogenesis in 
embryo development contradicts a common belief, namely that the phenotype is 
determined by the genotype. In contrast, we assume that embryo development is 
accompanied by the emergence of new levels and sub-levels of agency, which fol-
low learning-like activities to acquire competence in their functioning. This process 
is associated with the emergence of new sign relations which are encoded in the 
three-dimensional structure of a developing organism as well as in the epigenetic 
state of individual cells in the body. This kind of embodied memory is then used as 
a scaffold for the subsequent activities of an organism and its parts. Most develop-
mental adaptations emerge repeatedly in each new organism, and therefore the 
degree of novelty is often small. Nevertheless, elements of novelty are always pres-
ent because of the context-dependent modification of development in response to 
the ever-changing environment.
The most convincing example of semiogenesis during development is the selec-
tion of T-cells in thymus. T-cells perform their immune functions by binding foreign 
protein fragments (peptides) that are connected to the major histocompatibility 
complex (MHC) protein. The T-cell receptor gene is modified by cell-specific 
recombination of random segments of the parental gene, and thus, the binding prop-
erties of the protein receptor synthesized from the gene are variable among cells and 
heritable. To ensure the functionality of T-cells, they are subject to positive and 
6 After evolution.
8.3  Adaptation in Development

244
negative selection in the thymus (Starr et al., 2003). Positive selection7 ensures that 
T-cells can bind MHC protein within 3–4 days. Cells that fail to bind MHC on the 
surface of thymic epithelium die. T-cells that survive positive selection move into 
the second portion of the thymus, where they undergo negative selection. Negative 
selection is needed to ensure that T-cells do not bind self-peptides derived from 
native proteins synthesized in the same organism. Binding to native proteins may 
cause an autoimmune disease, where normal tissues are attacked by immune cells 
(e.g., T-cells). In the second portion of thymus, T-cells encounter macrophages (i.e., 
phagocytic immune cells) that carry various self-peptides on their surface. T-cells 
that bind self-peptides become marked for destruction. Only those T-cells that 
passed through both positive and negative selection can leave thymus and enter 
blood circulation. Each of these cells is specialized in binding to a specific type of 
foreign proteins without targeting any native proteins. Because there are a large 
number of T-cells circulating in the blood, they together mediate a defense response 
against most major types of foreign proteins. In semiotic terms, each T-cell that 
passed selection in thymus can respond to some foreign protein, which is a sign 
vehicle, and initiate a defense action, which is the interpretant. Defense actions 
depend on the type of a T-cell: cytotoxic T-cells kill virus-infected cells (or cancer 
cells), whereas helper T-cells activate other types of immune cells and produce sig-
naling molecules that are necessary for the inflammation response. This example 
shows that developing cells can undergo selection that makes them semiotically 
competent. The process resembles evolution by natural selection (or artificial selec-
tion) applied to cells within an organism instead of to organisms within a population.
Gerald Edelman, who won a Nobel Prize in 1972 for his study of immune cells, 
hypothesized that the selection of cells within an organism is not limited to the 
immune system but also occurs in other parts of an organism, including the nervous 
system. He summarized his theory in the book Neural Darwinism – The theory of 
neuronal group selection (Edelman, 1987). His main idea is that embryogenesis and 
the development of a nervous system is a self-organizing process that includes ele-
ments of selection. Neurons establish contacts with each other based on the selec-
tive adhesion of protein molecules to the outer surface of other cells. Interacting 
cells regulate the fate of each other by exchanging signals that control survival, 
apoptosis (self-induced death), differentiation, and excitation. Contacts between 
neural cells, called synapses, support complex communication processes that regu-
late the future strength of the connection based on a self-reinforcing feedback. In 
particular, groups of neurons can form strong connections between each other if 
they process functionally interrelated stimuli. This theory was criticized on the 
grounds that neural groups, in contrast with natural selection and immune selection, 
have no true replication (Fernando et al., 2008). Nevertheless, selective adhesion 
and communication between cells can result in the emergence of neural networks 
that, for example, function as cognitive subagents (cognits). Because these circuits

selection.

develop new behavioral and developmental sign relations, Edelman’s theory sup-
ports the existence of semiogenesis in embryo development.
The role of genes in development is regulatory rather than prescriptive, and 
leaves substantial freedom to the developing embryo (Sharov, 2014). According to 
Waddington (1957), the fate of a cell, tissue, or organ can be described as a trajec-
tory of a ball that rolls in a ragged landscape (see Fig. 4.3), where the local topology 
of valleys and ridges is shaped by a gene regulatory network and sensory signals. 
The path of development and differentiation is generally irreversible, and the set of 
future possibilities becomes progressively narrowed. Some changes in this process 
nevertheless remain possible at the bifurcation points in the epigenetic landscape, 
where the direction of development can be modified by signals coming from neigh-
boring cells or from the environment.
The development of the nervous system of animals entails a large number of 
choices that are not inscribed in the genome. Axons of neurons select their path 
through the body and reach target tissues and individual target cells following 
chemical signals. This process is strongly affected by previous developmental 
events and may result in various kinds of phenotypic accommodation (West-­
Eberhard, 2005). Synapses that connect neurons are highly dynamic: some become 
established, and some disappear if they are not used. Neural connections are subject 
to adaptive changes which represent semiogenesis at the cellular level and can be 
translated into behavioral changes.
8.4  Physiological and Behavioral Adaptations
8.4.1  Physiological and Behavioral Plasticity
The third level of semiogenesis in organisms is represented by physiology and 
behavior, which include reversible changes of the body that are associated with 
specific functions. Physiological processes are internal and often restricted to a spe-
cific organ, whereas behavior is usually associated with movements of the whole 
body coordinated by the nervous system. The physiology and behavior of organisms 
are traditionally studied in the context of responses to incoming stimuli, both envi-
ronmental and internal. Here, we are mostly interested in the adaptive role of these 
responses.
Animals, plants, and even single-cell organisms adjust their habits to local condi-
tions, and in this way change their physiological and behavioral sign relations, thus 
contributing to semiogenesis. For example, dung beetles can utilize dung with dif-
ferent kinds of composition and smell, and change their preferences accordingly. 
The preferences of adult beetles may depend on the rearing conditions they experi-
enced at larval stages (Dormont et al., 2010); and thus, prior experiences help adults 
in selecting high-quality dung for laying eggs. Examples of physiological adaptive 
plasticity are habituation and sensitization, which are ubiquitous to all levels of life. 
8.4  Physiological and Behavioral Adaptations

246
Habituation is a non-conscious way of adapting to repeated conditions or stimuli, 
for example, by reducing sensitivity to the stimuli or increasing tolerance. For 
example, the sensitivity of bacterial chemoreceptors is decreased after repeated 
stimulation, being controlled by the methylation of receptor protein (Porter 
et al., 2011).
Physiological and behavioral adaptive plasticity is necessary for the establish-
ment of ecological interactions between organisms. Each ecosystem is unique and 
there is no universal genetic prescription for how to manage an organism’s interac-
tion with any possible environment. Animals without cognitive capacities as well as 
plants, fungi, and single-cell organisms all rely on their innate physiological and 
behavioral plasticity for adjusting their habits to specific environments.
An alternative strategy to adaptation is niche construction, which is the modify-
ing or shielding of the environment via specific behaviors (Odling-Smee et  al., 
2003). Many aphids8 inject analogues of plant hormones into the plants they feed 
on, which causes abnormal thickening of plant tissue, called gall. A gall provides 
easily accessible food for aphids (Larson & Whitham, 1991) and protects them from 
natural enemies (Stone & Schönrogge, 2003). In some cases, organisms at imma-
ture stages construct the niche for the following stage. For example, caterpillars of 
a silkworm spin a cocoon before turning into a pupa, and this cocoon protects the 
pupal stage from predators, parasitoids, and harmful environmental factors. Other 
examples of niche construction are spider webs, bark beetle tunnels, rodent bur-
rows, and bird nests.
8.4.2  Learning and Cognition
Learning is usually defined as gaining knowledge, skills, and values/preferences. 
This notion is strongly linked with human learning, which is a complex phenome-
non with a diverse internal taxonomy (Bloom et al., 1956). We restrict the notion of 
‘learning’ to cognitive representational processes; other individual behavioral adap-
tations such as habituation and sensitization belong to plasticity. In this respect, we 
disagree with Campbell et al. (2019: 355) who apply the notion of ‘learning’ to all 
cases of acquiring or modification of sign relations.
According to the “perceptual symbol” theory of Lawrence Barsalou (1999, 
2003), the basic type of representation, which he called “modal representation”, 
results from the reenacting of certain components of the sensorial neural pattern that 
is associated with an object (i.e., perception image) but without external stimuli.9 In 
other words, the same mental states are used both for perception and for making 
modal representations. Barsalou assumes that sensorial input patterns are generated 
8 Aphids are small plant-dwelling insects.
9 Barsalou (1999) contrasted modal representations with amodal ones, where concepts are repre-
sented by abstract elements (e.g., list of parts, frames, logic formula) that bear no similarity to 
perceptual states.

by neural simulators. In comparison with our model of categorical perception (Fig. 
7.6), the generation of a modal representation is a cognitive process that goes in a 
reverse direction (i.e. from type to particular) than the process of object recognition 
(from particular to the type).
Major kinds of learning are imprinting, psychomotor learning, orientation learn-
ing, and associative learning. Imprinting is a special case of learning because it is 
acquired non-consciously, and its relation to cognition can therefore be questioned. 
However, imprinting is representational, and the retrieval of imprinted representa-
tions is a part of animal cognition. Psychomotor learning (Iliadi et al., 2016) sup-
ports complex movements of animals such as running, swimming, flying, or holding 
objects. Although elementary actions (e.g., muscle contraction) are often controlled 
unconsciously, the sequences of actions together with feedback regulation are usu-
ally represented consciously in all cognitive animals. Such animals can deliberately 
initiate psychomotor actions and learn new patterns of activities. Orientation, or 
active learning, happens when animals (or humans) encounter new objects or situa-
tions and memorize their features and relations. This is often accompanied with 
interaction with new objects, such as walking around it, smelling, grabbing, biting, 
and so on. Because of orientation learning, animals acquire classifiers of new 
objects.
Experimental studies of associative learning in animals are discussed in Chap. 4. 
Major examples of associative learning are classical conditioning and instrumental 
conditioning, which are known in most classes of vertebrates and some inverte-
brates, such as arthropods and mollusks (Ginsburg & Jablonka, 2019: 294). A well-­
documented example of animal learning in nature is the emergence of a new feeding 
behavior in blue tits in England. These birds became attracted to door-delivered 
milk bottles and learned how to open a bottle and reach the milk (Lefebvre & 
Boogert, 2010) (Fig. 8.9). This behavior is certainly an example of learning, but it

248
should not be seen as an entirely new one. It emerged from a combination of already 
existing innate and acquired habits, such as orientation reflex and pecking move-
ments that were used previously to break the shell of nuts or the cover of insects.
In contrast to behavioral plasticity, which is based on heritable habits regulated 
by a nervous system or epigenetically, learning is supported by an advanced kind of 
memory – representational memory, which requires a nervous system with a brain 
(Nee & D’Esposito, 2016). Non-representational memory performs only regulatory 
functions, whereas, representational memory supports concepts, such as objects, 
feelings, beliefs, or ideas. Concepts are similar to classifiers and can be used for 
recognizing object types; however, they have several additional features. First, rep-
resentational memory connects concepts with their mental representations in the 
form of mental images or abstract schemes. Second, it carries an inventory of 
already learned concepts. By accessing this inventory, animals can recognize that a 
certain object is new. New objects usually attract animal attention (this is an orienta-
tion reflex), and if an object appears useful (e.g., edible), then an animal learns to 
recognize it and forms a concept that is added to the mental inventory. And third, 
representational memory includes a network of relations between concepts, which 
is also known as a conceptual field (Barsalou, 1999). Most concepts are linked with 
attributes, functionally related concepts, similar concepts, and mental images. 
Because of this feature, animals can use representational memory to associative one 
concept (e.g., a feeling) with another, entirely different concept (e.g., food). 
Concepts can function as mental interpretants that activate relations with other con-
cepts. For example, emotional and anticipative feelings are important for motivating 
animal activity and strengthening of memory associations.
When a cognitive animal thinks about an object that is not perceived, it may 
attempt to find it. For this purpose, animals use search images of objects, which can 
be reminiscent of visual representations. The term was coined by Jakob von Uexküll 
and is used in partly similar, partly different ways in contemporary ethology (for a 
discussion on the relevance of Uexküll’s notion, see Tønnessen, 2018). Von Uexküll 
(1957: 375) wrote: “Search images undoubtedly exist in the Umwelt of dogs. When 
the master orders his dog to retrieve a stick, the dog [...] has a quite specific search 
image of the stick”. Search images are used as templates for filtering incoming sen-
sorial data (e.g., images, sounds, smells) and finding potentially matching objects. 
This process was emulated by a computational method called “dynamic logic” that 
has been used in AI projects (Fig. 8.10) (Perlovsky, 2007).
Any update of representational memory, such as the establishment of a new con-
cept or a new association between concepts, implies learning and semiogenesis. In 
cases of radical change of the environment (e.g., when animals are domesticated), a 
semantic network of concepts may require a major revision, and this is also an 
instance of semiogenesis. Jean Piaget distinguished between two types of learning 
in relation to their degree of novelty: assimilation concerns fitting new experiences 
into already existing ideas, whereas accommodation involves reshaping existing 
ideas (or models) to increase their logical integration (Block, 1982).
8  Semiogenesis

249
8.4.3  Advanced Cognitive Functions
In Chap. 4 we already discussed advanced cognitive functions in animals, such as 
reflective cognition and unlimited associative learning (UAL) (Ginsburg & Jablonka, 
2019: 226), also known as non-elemental learning (Giurfa, 2003). UAL requires 
mental abstract operations such as developing classifiers not only for objects but 
also for parts and features of objects. The semiotics of parts is often considered as a 
special domain of knowledge called meronomy (Kull, 2019) or mereology 
(Gruszczyński & Varzi, 2015). Animals capable of recognizing parts and their com-
binations can recognize whole objects based on the composition of their parts rather 
than from non-partitioned perception images. In an evolutionary perspective, this 
development leads to increased use of models and logic.
In general, models are informative representations of some objects. In this sense, 
any learning can be called ‘modeling’. However, the term ‘model’ is mostly used in 
the sense of a rule that remains true or brings success in a large number of similar 
situations. In other words, models are generalized representations. One approach to 
modeling is using quantitative parameters that can change from one situation to 
another. Such a parametric approach was implemented in the “dynamic logic” 
model, where visual data are searched for specific shapes with varying parameters 
(e.g., the width of a crescent was adjusted in Fig. 8.10).
Using models allow animals to verify their perceptions. The correctness of object 
categorization is of vital importance for many of them. If a food item is not correctly 
identified, an animal may either starve by rejecting edible food, or get poisoned or 
wounded by eating non-edible things. To improve the accuracy of object recogni-
tion, animals use verification via additional sensorial input and additional classifi-
ers. For example, a predator is chasing a prey by following the tracks. Eventually, 
the prey appears in the visual field and the predator has a chance to assess whether 
or not the prey is worth chasing. The model of hunting in the cognition of a predator 
includes additional variables such as images of potential prey. If a perceived animal 
is a skunk then it is better for a predator to leave it alone because skunks can spray 
predators with an irritating liquid with a strong, unpleasant smell. Interestingly, 
animals with strong defense capacities often develop warning coloration to simplify 
their recognition by predators. Skunks, for example, have contrasting 
Fig. 8.10  “Dynamic logic” as a method for image analysis. A parameterized pattern is used to 
search large input data to detect matching elements. (Modified from Perlovsky, 2016)
8.4  Physiological and Behavioral Adaptations

250
black-and-­white stripes on their body that cannot be confused with any other animal 
and are easy to learn.
Animals use models for predicting their own movements and the movements of 
other organisms (e.g., prey or predators). For example, squirrels need to adjust their 
jumps to the distance between the branches of a tree. A fox can project the shortest 
path for capturing a moving rabbit. The flying behavior of birds requires complex, 
instant modeling that accounts for speed, lifting power, and potential obstacles. 
Bees use spatial models to navigate towards sources of food in relation to the sun 
even if the sun changes its position in the sky. However, it is not clear if the spatial 
models of bees are learned, imitated, or based solely on instincts.
Thomas Sebeok and Marcel Danesi (2000) distinguished between three levels of 
semiotic modeling. The primary modeling system is based on the instinctive capac-
ity of organisms to associate perceptual properties of objects with iconic mental 
representations. The secondary modeling system associates objects with each other 
and with global reference systems, such as time and space, and establishes index 
relations. Finely, the tertiary modeling system is responsible for constructing 
abstract symbolic relations such as numbers and shapes, and connect observations 
with cultural contexts.
The role of modeling increased dramatically in human ancestors with the advent 
of language. Daniel Dor (2015: 24–25) describes language as a communication 
technology for transferring the experience of imagination:
The communicator provides the receiver with a code, a plan, a skeletal list of the basic 
coordination of the experience—which the receiver is then expected to use as a scaffold for 
experiential imagination. Following the code, the receiver raises past experiences from 
memory and then reconstructs and recombines them to produce a novel, imagined 
experience.
The interpretation of vocal or written sentences requires modeling operations 
such as recognizing individual words, associating words with concepts, and inte-
grating concepts with a meaningful idea or thought. Thus, language-based human 
concepts are mutually comprehensible. In particular, “A critical aspect of human 
concepts is their mutual comprehensibility; the sharable properties are what we 
want to understand first and foremost” (Barsalou, 1999: 624).
Human language is a product of long and mostly gradual evolution, unification, 
and rare technological revolutions (Dor & Jablonka, 2010). The communicative 
advantages of language are immense, but this topic is beyond the scope of our book. 
We will just cite Ginsburg and Jablonka, who assumed that language helps humans 
to share their experiences and models of reality, and in this way, makes our experi-
ential world objective: “The common ground of the shared words led to the reifica-
tion of what they signified — the signifieds became ‘objective’ because they were 
shared through collective identification and went beyond the individual’s idiosyn-
cratic experience” (Ginsburg & Jablonka, 2019: 475).
According to Terrence Deacon (2012), one of the specific features of language is 
the use of symbols. However, Deacon’s understanding of symbols is quite different 
from Peirce’s approach, where symbols are considered as signs that refer to objects 
8  Semiogenesis

251
by convention or habit, but not by similarity or connection (e.g., material, causal, or 
spatial). Peirce’s symbols may include simple reflexes and conditioning, but Deacon 
(2012: 10) sees this understanding of symbols as oversimplification: “The focus on 
arbitrary correlations as the defining attribute of symbolic reference is a serious 
oversimplification that collapses critical distinctions between sign vehicle and ref-
erential properties.” Deacon’s theory is more in line with linguistic and psychologi-
cal traditions, where symbols are viewed as signs of abstract ideas or forms which 
are logically connected to other abstract ideas or forms. Accordingly, Deacon (1997: 
69–83) defined symbols as signs with a “dual reference” referring both to real 
objects and other sings, and where references to objects depend on the references to 
other signs. For this reason, symbols cannot be reduced to simple correlations or 
arbitrary associations. Deacon wrote:
To learn symbols we begin by learning symbol-object correlations, but once learned, these 
associations must be treated as no more than clues for determining the more crucial rela-
tionships. (ibid: 83)
According to Deacon, learned associations between arbitrarily different things 
are indexes rather than symbols, and they are easily learned by many animals. In 
contrast, symbols with a dual reference lie mostly in the domain of human language, 
although some primates can learn symbols if they interact closely with humans. 
Symbols can include iconic or indexial components, but these features are not 
essential for symbolic reference. What is essential is the “dependency on an external 
system of relations” to other signs and “the constructive nature of this interpretative 
process” (ibid: 13). Because symbols often include iconic or indexial components, 
they can easily be misinterpreted as icons or indexes. Thus, children or animals that 
are learning to use symbols require a phase of un-learning, which implies restrain-
ing themselves from simplified interpretation of symbols as icons or indexes 
(Deacon, 1997).
Symbols in Deacon’s sense are mostly used by humans, but some elements of 
symbolic reference occur in animals too. For example, cats bring captured mice to 
their owners to show their respect and asking for patting or reward. Similarly, dogs 
may bring a newspaper or shoes to their owner. Dogs understand their service roles 
well when they help a shepherd or a hunter. These symbols are grounded in the 
social habits of the wild ancestors of these animals, and are relatively simple in 
comparison to human symbols.
A powerful method for model construction is logic with its three main types of 
inference: induction, deduction, and abduction (also known as retroduction), as 
summarized by Charles Peirce (1931–1958: CP 2.226–241). Induction is reasoning 
from particulars to something generic, whereas deduction is derivation of particu-
lars from something generic; these types of inference were described already by 
Aristotle. The novel idea of Peirce was abduction, which is inference to the best 
explanation or model for a phenomenon. Unlike induction and deduction, abduction 
cannot be formalized, because it includes elements of guesswork and may yield 
multiple competing hypotheses. Contemporary statistical evaluation against exist-
ing evidence (Karvetski et al., 2013) and other heuristic tests (Heuer, 1999: 95–109)

allow critical evaluation of each hypothesis and provide reasons for selecting the 
best hypothesis/model. This approach can e.g. be applied for verification of object 
categorization by animals, as discussed above. Lorenzo Magnani (2009) explored 
eco-cognitive aspects of abductive reasoning in animals, humans, and AI. He distin-
guished between ‘creative abduction’ that is used to generate plausible hypotheses 
and ‘selective abduction’ that helps in testing and selecting the best hypothesis 
among available ones.
Logic aids humans, but also brings serious challenges to human language, 
because it generates paradoxes (Sainsbury, 2009: 127). Another problem is that 
logic can be used to construct artificial sets of objects that are not classifiable. A 
simple example is negation: ‘masculine’ vs. ‘non-masculine’. The problem is that 
the set of ‘non-masculine’ objects is not classifiable because we do not know its 
characteristics. The closest notion to ‘non-masculine’ seems to be ‘feminine’, but 
these notions are certainly not equivalent. Similarly, ‘non-feminine’ is not equiva-
lent to ‘masculine’. Algirdas Julien Greimas proposed a semiotic square to compare 
such notions. He considered the relation between ‘masculine’ and ‘feminine’ to be 
one of contraries, and the relation between ‘masculine’ and ‘non-feminine’ to be an 
implication (Hendricks, 1989). Co-evolution of logic and language is an interesting 
phenomenon that keeps enriching human cognitive capacities.
8.4.4  Intentionality
Cognition is a necessary tool for intentional behavior, which is a higher level of 
goal-directed activity of agents. According to Daniel Dennett (1987: 23–25), the 
behavior of intentional systems can be explained reasonably well by a heuristic 
called the intentional stance:
Here is how it works: first you decide to treat the object whose behavior is to be predicted 
as a rational agent; then you figure out what beliefs that agent ought to have, given its place 
in the world and its purpose. Then you figure out what desires it ought to have, on the same 
considerations, and finally you predict that this rational agent will act to further its goals in 
the light of its beliefs”. (ibid: 17)
This reasoning became a foundation for belief-desire psychology. The belief 
module of cognitive agents is more than an object classifier; it also includes an 
ontology: cognitive representations of objects, features, relations, events, and 
actions, as well as facts about existing objects and events that occurred (possibly 
linked to specific space-time references), and association/correlation between them. 
Desires/goals can be modeled as associations of existing components of the world 
with values, needs, and emotions. Examples of the basic desires of people, accord-
ing to Dennett, are “survival, absence of pain, food, comfort, procreation, entertain-
ment” (ibid: 20). Thus, the belief-desire model allows abstract problem solving 
without trials and errors, which constitutes rational learning or thinking.
8  Semiogenesis

253
Our understanding of the intentional stance is somewhat different from the one 
proposed by Dennett. Dennett emphasizes that beliefs and desires of agents are 
selected on the basis of common sense, and some general considerations, such as 
the place of an agent in the world and its purpose. In contrast, we consider the inten-
tional stance as a part of science, more specifically, biosemiotic science. Accordingly, 
we consider common sense as not sufficient, and advocate using behavioral and 
physiological data to improve our understanding of animals’ beliefs and desires.
Charles Turner elaborated the principle of intentionality by asserting that beliefs 
and desires are not fixed, but instead, dynamically adjusted depending on the state 
of the agent, such as disease, hunger, or fear. He wrote:
Every intentional act is guided by what is designated as wise by the subject’s currently 
active mental model, whether it is the subject’s baseline model (measured for adequacy 
against objective wisdom) or a deviation there from (foolishness) that is traceable to distort-
ing influences on the subject’s beliefs and desires. (Turner, 2017: 5)
In other words, he assumed that rationality can be biased depending on the state 
of the agent. Turner included the “currently active mental model” into his definition 
of intentionality. He remarked that “the mental model is more appropriately treated 
as a tool for customizing beliefs and desires to the situation” (ibid: 4). In addition, 
the rationality of agents is limited by a number of factors, including emotions and 
the availability of actions. Turner proposed the term “wisdom” to evaluate the 
degree of rationality: “Wisdom, as used here, is a measure of the practical under-
standing and rationality of intentional beings” (ibid.). For example, based on behav-
ioral tests, stressed or sick animals demonstrate lower levels of “wisdom” comparing 
to healthy animals.
Intentional animals often find themselves in a dilemma where two or many 
desires cannot be pursued simultaneously. To resolve a dilemma, agents need to 
associate various kinds of desires with a single generalized value which stands for a 
reward or reinforcement. Then, associations of desires with reward can be moved 
into the “belief” module, whereas the “desire module” becomes reduced to the 
choice between “greed” associated with maximization of rewards, and “explora-
tion”, which includes desires that are stripped of their reward component. This 
model of intentionality is generally assumed in the domain of reinforcement learn-
ing (Sutton & Barto, 2018).
8.5  Growth in Semiotic Complexity
Semiogenesis creates new sign relations, and in this way increases the overall semi-
otic complexity of agents, which can also be called functional complexity because 
most sign relations in organisms represent some function.10 The biological functions 
10 Most human symbols are not linked with biological functions, but they typically serve important 
intellectual, aesthetic, emotional or social functions.

254
of the lowest level are performed by proteins, which are encoded in the genome. 
Longer proteins also tend to perform more complex functions (i.e., employing a 
larger set of sign relations), and the length of proteins is roughly proportional to the 
length of the coding region in the corresponding gene. Consistent with these two 
assumptions, Adami et al. (2000) proposed to measure the “biological complexity” 
of organisms by the size of their functional and non-redundant genome.11 Adami 
et al. suggested quantifying complexity from the fitness weights of each nucleotide 
in the genome, but this information is not available. A more practical approach is to 
consider the functional genome as the total size of non-redundant and functional 
(e.g., coding and regulatory) regions in all chromosomes (Sharov, 2006). It is better 
to call this measure “genome complexity” because it does not account for those 
functions that are programmed epigenetically.
The rate of increase of genome complexity in evolution appears to be driven by 
various positive feedback loops. First, some genes benefit from the function of other 
genes (Eigen & Schuster, 1979); second, new genes often originate via the duplica-
tion and recombination of already existing genes in the genome (Patthy, 1999; 
Massingham et al., 2001); and third, large genomes support more distinct regulatory 
networks and morphological elements at various scales than smaller genomes do, 
which in turn provide them with new functional niches for emerging novel genes. 
Because of these mechanisms, the genome complexity has increased roughly expo-
nentially in evolution with a doubling time of ca. 340 million years (Sharov & 
Gordon, 2018) (see Chap. 5).
However, the increase of genome complexity in evolution was not fast enough to 
explain the emergence of higher forms of life. If semiogenesis were restricted to the 
genome alone, the Earth would likely still be populated only by single-cell organ-
isms. However, life ‘discovered’ a way to accelerate semiogenesis in evolution by 
expanding the epigenetic information. In contrast to genes, epigenetic signs are 
rewritable at any time and can be copied whenever needed. A reliable and large 
eukaryotic genome was able to support complex protein interactions, including pre-
cise modification of proteins and sensing of these modifications. As a result, besides 
their regular functions, all proteins in a cell became targets of protein modification, 
where every protein can be used for writing messages, erasing them, and writ-
ing again.
Eukaryotes started progressively using epigenetic memory to encode or modify 
their functions. Because the epigenetic memory is rewritable, it can easily support 
phenotypic plasticity in embryo development. Several types of epigenetic signs are 
closely associated with chromatin, which includes DNA and a large number of scaf-
folding and regulating proteins. Chromatin consists of a DNA double helix looped 
around clusters of histone proteins that carry extending tails (Fig. 8.11). Amino 
acids in these tails can be marked by attaching various chemical groups, such as 
methyl, acetyl, or phosphate, and these marks serve as chemical signs for molecular 
11 Initially, the size of the genome was evaluated by total DNA content per cell, which led to the 
C-value paradox (Patrushev & Minkevich, 2008) (see also Chap. 5).

255
subagents. For example, EED protein, which ‘recognizes’ tri-methylation of lysine 
(K) at position 27  in histone protein H3 (shortly, H3K27me3), binds to the 
H3K27me3 chromatin mark, and recruits the PRC2 complex (Margueron et al., 
2009). The histone mark H3K27me3 is needed for condensing the chromatin and 
making genes inactive in this segment of the genome. The PRC2 molecular com-
plex is a subagent that maintains and expands repressive chromatin marks in the 
genome. It contains enzyme EZH2 (Sarma et al., 2008), which is capable of apply-
ing new H3K27me3 chromatin marks to other histone tails located nearby. This 
process of interaction between chromatin, EED, and EZH2 repairs missing chroma-
tin marks and supports the propagation of chromatin marks along the chromosome 
(Fig. 8.11). When DNA is duplicated, the repressive chromatin marks are restored 
by PRC2 in both DNA copies, so that epigenetic memory is preserved after cell 
division.
Some epigenetic signs (in germ cells) can be transferred to the descendent organ-
isms, but the bulk portion of epigenetic information is not heritable and is lost with 
the death of an organism. Thus, the functional complexity of organisms is a combi-
nation of the genetic portion that increases gradually in a sequence of generations, 
and the epigenetic portion that grows with embryo development in every generation 
and then collapses at death (Fig. 8.12). As the epigenetic portion of semiotic com-
plexity has increased, the role of the genome has shifted from direct coding and the 
controlling functions of an organism to also creating scaffolds for the embryo devel-
opment (i.e., making the epigenetic landscape). The developing body then takes 
over these functions later in life. Due to a faster increase of epigenetic complexity, 
the total semiotic complexity of multicellular organisms (i.e., the sequence of peaks 
in the green line, Fig. 8.12) has increased faster than genetic complexity (the blue 
line) in evolution.

8.5  Growth in Semiotic Complexity

256
Let’s summarize the advantages for organisms to develop the epigenetic level of 
semiotic complexity on the top of the basic genetic level. First, the genome is not 
rewritable and thus cannot encode the plasticity of phenotypes. Second, embryonic 
cells can divide without losing complexity, whereas physical division of an adult 
animal or plant is most often not practically possible. Only simple animals can 
divide (e.g., a planarian), but the division of a complex animal is a formidable prob-
lem that so far has no solution (although some animals can regenerate a limb or tail). 
Thus, the body of complex animals and plants has to be mortal. The obvious disad-
vantage of such life cycle is the loss of the most of epigenetic complexity with the 
death of an organism. But a mortal body brings important advantages to the lineage 
because old individuals are replaced by young healthy organisms with increased 
adaptability to the changing environment. If organisms were dividing as adults, then 
it would be hard to preserve differentiated cells in a healthy condition forever.
At some level of epigenetic complexity, animals developed a nervous system and 
a brain. The initial functions of the nervous system could have been to extend epi-
genetic regulation to animal behavior and movement, which were initially mostly 
heritable. The semiotic power of brains increased dramatically after the emergence 
of learning, which expanded behaviors beyond heritable instincts and enabled 
organisms to develop mental representations of objects and explore new classes of 
objects. Similar to epigenetic signs, most cognitive complexity is lost with the death 
of an organism, except for a few sign relations that are passed on to the offspring 
and to peers via teaching, playing, and imitation. But despite of a shortness of con-
scious lifespan, cognition provides a tremendous advantage to animals by 
Time

of semiogenesis are shown: genetic, epigenetic, and cognitive. Epigenetic complexity increases in

groups of animals; it reappears in each generation after the completion of embryo development and 
onset of fetal development. The rate of increase of epigenetic and cognitive complexity is exagger-

supporting complex behaviors such as running, flying, and communicating with 
peers, which all require instant self-assessments.
Cognitive semiosis further accelerated the increase in the overall semiotic com-
plexity of organisms in evolution (the sequence of peaks in the orange line, 
Fig. 8.12). This increase of cognitive complexity is more difficult to measure than 
the growth of genomic complexity because we still do not know how most mental 
functions are enabled. The size of a brain can be used as a first approximation of 
cognitive complexity. The brain size also correlates with the dimensions of the body 
(McHenry, 1975), which makes comparisons difficult. Plots of brain mass versus 
body mass, nevertheless, lead to clear classifications and trends (Jerison, 1973). The 
functionality of the brain may depend more on its structure (e.g., on surface area, 
neuron density, or connectedness) than on the volume (Roth & Dicke, 2005), but 
these features are difficult to quantify. More reliable trends in brain size can be 
detected only within a narrow taxonomic group. For example, the regression of 
log10-transformed brain size (CC) against time (My) has a slope of 0.189 (t = 35.43, 
p < 0.001, r2 = 0.87) (Shultz et al., 2012), which implies a doubling time of 1.59 
million years. Thus, the rate of brain increase in evolution exceeds the rate of 
increase of genome complexity 214-fold, which shows the advantage of cognitive 
semiogenesis as compared to genome-based semiogenesis.
The origin of humans marks another major change in the pattern of growth of 
functional complexity (it is not shown in Fig. 8.12), because humans invented meth-
ods to transfer cognitive complexity between minds. With the advent of language, 
the content of human memory became shared between individuals and preserved in 
subsequent generations. This has resulted in a continuous growth of both linguistic 
and cultural complexity of human cultures. This qualitative transition has fueled a 
further acceleration of functional complexity in human activities. A rough estimate 
of the doubling time of human cultural semiosis can be obtained from quantifying 
the historical increase of language units. For example, the number of characters in 
the Chinese language increased from ca. 2500 at 3200 years ago (the Oracle bone 
script) to ca. 5000–6000 at the present time (Norman, 1988), which yields the dou-
bling time of ca. 2800 years. Another approach is to track the total number of lan-
guages against historical time. The analysis of 10 human language lineages (such as 
Indo-European, Austronesian, Bantu, and Semitic among others) showed a dou-
bling time of language counts ca. 700 years (Hamilton & Walker, 2019). Based on 
these estimates, the rate of growth of human linguistic semiosis is 568–2271 folds 
greater than the rate of increase of brain size in Hominids.
This overview of the types of semiogenesis shows that each new level brings 
qualitative changes and elevates the rate of exponential increase of the overall semi-
otic complexity of agents.

Chapter 9
Phenomenology
Abstract  In this chapter we discuss the phenomenological tradition within phi-
losophy with emphasis on representative phenomenological positions on subjectiv-
ity, sentience, consciousness and self-consciousness, and make the argument that 
giving phenomenology a biosemiotic grounding will make it more comprehensive. 
Even though both Husserl and Heidegger, two classics of phenomenology, acknowl-
edged that animals have subjective lifeworlds, their respective phenomenologies 
were clearly anthropocentric. The same goes for most mainstream versions of con-
temporary phenomenology. Heidegger states this anthropocentric bias plainly when, 
after referring to the Umwelt theory of Jakob von Uexküll, he claims that animals 
are “poor in world”. The Umwelt theory offers an alternative, more pluralistic 
framework for phenomenology  – a phenomenology beyond the human, with a 
biosemiotic basis. Von Uexküll’s Umwelt theory was discussed by Merleau-Ponty 
and has further inspired several contemporary philosophers within and beyond phe-
nomenology. In the chapter we also discuss the relation between semiotics and phe-
nomenology, including Peirce’s ideas and recent calls for a naturalized 
phenomenology. While modern phenomenology was from its inception program-
matically presented as anti-naturalism, leading contemporary phenomenologists 
favour realignment between phenomenology and naturalism. With its roots in sign 
theory and biology, biosemiotics can contribute further to this endeavour, and be an 
important piece in the puzzle when realigning phenomenological studies of subjec-
tive experience and behaviour with natural science.
9.1  What Is Phenomenology? And What Could It Be?
Before defining what phenomenology amounts to, an important distinction should 
be introduced, since the term ‘phenomenology’ is referred to in two entirely differ-
ent academic settings. Namely, it is informative to distinguish between ‘philosophi-
cal phenomenology’, which concerns phenomenology as a philosophy, and 
‘scientific phenomenology’, which concerns empirical studies built on a phenome-
nological theoretical foundation and applying some form of phenomenological 

264
methodology for data gathering and analysis (Giorgi, 2000). The latter strain of 
phenomenology is typically associated with qualitative approaches to studying 
human or societal phenomena. This chapter will cover and critically discuss phe-
nomenology in both these senses. Some issues related to phenomenology’s dual 
role as philosophy and scientific approach will be addressed in Sect. 9.3 “Naturalized 
Phenomenology”. A brief historical overview of phenomenology’s development 
was provided in Chap. 2 and will not be repeated here (see Sect. 2.7. Classical 
Phenomenology: Husserl, Heidegger, and Merleau-Ponty).
Smith (2018) defines phenomenology as “the study of structures of conscious-
ness as experienced from the first-person point of view.” With this starting point, 
one would think that phenomenology as a study should concern animal conscious-
ness1 just as much as it concerns human consciousness. This is no less the case given 
that phenomenologists tend to agree that several animals, as well as humans, have 
first-person experience.2 However, many phenomenologists have suggested or 
assumed that in order to be of relevance for phenomenology, the conscious experi-
ence in question must be reflective. With that stricter definition of phenomenology, 
phenomenology is not, without qualification, the study of structures of conscious-
ness as experienced from the first-person point of view in general. Instead, it is the 
study of structures of reflective consciousness as experienced from the first-person 
point of view. And as it happens, there is considerable disagreement among phe-
nomenologists about whether the consciousness of various animals is reflective, as 
it tends to be in the case of human beings,3 or merely pre-reflective. Perhaps in 
consequence of this, mainstream phenomenology typically focuses on human expe-
rience only. With the exception of mentions of animal lifeworlds in passing in a few 
classical works, that has been the case historically, and it remains the case today.
The anthropocentric bias that has been evident in the history of phenomenology 
to date has arguably led to neglect of key questions related to the phenomenological 
nature of animal forms of experience, and of foundational questions about phenom-
enological experience broadly considered. Given this anthropocentric heritage, and 
the tradition of limiting phenomenological inquiry to studies of reflective 
consciousness, many mainstream phenomenologists take the default position that 
phenomenological notions are appropriate for use only in a human context and 
question the relevance of applying them in non-human contexts. Many therefore 
1 In this chapter we mainly use the notion ‘consciousness’ rather than ‘cognition’ because the for-
mer concept is a better match with the traditional discourse in phenomenology.
2 We here apply the term ‘animal’ in the sense in which it is applied within biology. In popular sci-
ence and lay language, the term is often taken to refer to sentient animals only. Most phenomenolo-
gists would probably agree that all sentient animals have a first-person experience.
3 Stereotypically, human beings are regarded as having reflective consciousness, without reserva-
tion. But there are clearly many exceptions to this rule, e.g., in early life stages and possibly during 
sleep. In fact, even though human beings for the most part have reflective consciousness, no human 
being has reflective consciousness throughout the entire lifetime. The ways in which human con-
sciousness can be reflective are also eroded under the influence of certain brain diseases including 
Alzheimer’s disease and other instances of dementia, and during abnormal mental states such as 
psychosis.
9  Phenomenology

265
regard phenomenology as a method of the ‘human sciences’ (see e.g. Yee, 2019). 
When attempts are made to go beyond the human realm in phenomenology, charges 
of anthropomorphism are not uncommon, and some scholars assert that human con-
cepts are not at all applicable beyond the realm of human consciousness. However, 
taking this position would imply ignoring the fact that all scientific and philosophi-
cal concepts are “human” in the trivial sense that they are expressed in human lan-
guage – and yet, this has not stopped scientists and philosophers from other fields of 
study from investigating and describing non-human nature (no matter how tenta-
tively) with the use of “human” concepts.
This raises the question of whether or not there are methodological consider-
ations – e.g., easier access to human minds than to animal minds due to the oppor-
tunities we have for using language as a mediating tool in data gathering – that 
could justify the neglect of animal consciousness within the phenomenological tra-
dition. Within psychology, methods for “descriptive phenomenology” (e.g., Giorgi, 
2009) are typically focused on analysis of texts and transcriptions of verbal inter-
views, thus systematically utilizing human beings’ capacity for use of language in 
their reflective expression of thoughts and experiences. The same methods can for 
obvious reasons not be used in the study of animal consciousness.4 Nevertheless, as 
is made evident by comparative psychology, there are empirical methods for study-
ing animal consciousness on a case study basis, including studying consciousness 
across the human/non-human divide in a comparative fashion. Such comparative 
studies generally draw on methods in ethology (including various methods for 
observation of behavior) and cognitive sciences.
Since hardly anyone today claims that only humans are conscious, and since it is 
scientifically possible to study animal consciousness using empirical approaches, 
there is no convincing reason why phenomenology should be fundamentally differ-
ent from other fields of study in which both human and non-human phenomena are 
examined. In this context, applying “human concepts” on animal phenomena does 
not in any way imply that animal phenomena “are human”, or that no distinction can 
or should be made between human and animal phenomena. With this said, it is per-
tinent to note that applying the same phenomenological notions which has for the 
most part been applied in a human context in the context of animal consciousness 
might in many cases require clarifications, nuances or introduction of finer distinc-
tions to avoid conflating dissimilar phenomena. The fact that little attention has so 
far been devoted to studying animal consciousness within phenomenology only 
reinforces this point. Many phenomenological terms are well-developed in studies 
of human experience, but in need of further consideration or development when 
applied in the context of non-human, animal experience.
Besides the methodological considerations, two main explanations of why most 
phenomenologists have tended to study only human phenomena are conceivable. 
4 However, interviews with various experts on animal behaviour (who may be academics or practi-
tioners such as e.g. farmers, veterinarians or zookeepers) can fruitfully be used to inform and 
enrich studies of animal consciousness within a more-than-human descriptive phenomenology 
(Tønnessen, 2021, forthcoming).
9.1  What Is Phenomenology? And What Could It Be?

266
This could either be because they have been influenced by the traditional anthropo-
centric bias of the discipline, and in consequence of this, have been poorly informed 
about animal biology and consciousness. Or it could be because the human con-
sciousness is of a so exceptional nature that comparing it to animal forms of con-
sciousness is not informative or relevant.5 This latter stand would be a version of 
human exceptionalism, the idea that humans and human phenomena are literally 
exceptional and therefore incomparable to non-humans and non-human phenom-
ena. While human exceptionalist stands might in some cases be intellectually justifi-
able, in so far as they are backed by solid evidence and argumentation, they can only 
legitimately be defended by rational arguments with roots in empirical reality.
It is in this context worth noting that even though both Edmund Husserl 
(1859–1938) and Martin Heidegger (1889–1976) predominantly focused on the 
human consciousness and underlined the distinctness of the human kinds of con-
sciousness, lifeworlds and phenomena, none of them denied the reality of animal 
forms of these (see Husserl, 1954, 1970 and Heidegger, 1995). Already this should 
secure a place within phenomenology for studies of non-human phenomena, and for 
a broad biology-based version of comparative phenomenology where human and 
non-human phenomena are studied in comparison. Heidegger states his anthropo-
centric bias and moderate exceptionalist stand plainly when, after referring to the 
Umwelt theory of Jakob von Uexküll, he claims that animals are “poor in world” 
(ibid: 176, 185, 192, 193, 196). In characterizing animal lifeworlds in this way, he 
distinguishes animal lifeworlds as essentially inferior to human lifeworlds, but nev-
ertheless acknowledges the existence of animal lifeworlds.
In his main work Being and time, Heidegger (1962 [1927]) stresses the excep-
tional character of human experience, consciousness and existence by introducing 
the notion of the Dasein (literally: there-being). This is a term that applies only to 
human beings, and which is closely associated with another of Heidegger’s key 
notions, “being-in-the-world” (In-der-Welt-sein). Heidegger thus indicates that ani-
mals and other non-humans have no form of being in the world that compares 
with – i.e., is on par with – the human way of being in the world. In Heidegger 
(1995) the human being is characterized as “world-forming”, whereas the animal is 
poor in world, and the stone is “worldless”. Heidegger does not deny that non-­
human organisms are in the world, or that animals experience being in the world, 
but in his view, they do not relate to the world in any way that resembles how human 
beings relate to being in the world, and their mode of existence is therefore funda-
mentally different from ours. Though Heidegger develops a distinct, inventive 
5 Combining these two explanations might be most correct. Even if the neglect of animal con-
sciousness were mostly due to an anthropocentric bias, the exceptional nature of aspects of human 
consciousness could help explain some of the disinterest in non-human forms of consciousness, 
since this exceptional character makes ignoring at least some aspects of animal forms of con-
sciousness more reasonable. And conversely, even if the neglect of animal consciousness were 
mostly due to the exceptional nature of human consciousness, an anthropocentric bias (i.e., a pre-
dominant bordering on exclusive focus on the human form of consciousness) could help explain 
the neglect of animal consciousness given the lack of competence on animal consciousness such a 
bias will result in.

267
terminology for his version of phenomenology and for expressing his views on the 
human being’s place in the world, the core of his argumentation draws on the main-
stream phenomenological idea that human beings are distinguished by their (par-
ticular kind of) reflective consciousness.
The Umwelt theory of Jakob von Uexküll offers an alternative, more pluralistic 
framework for phenomenology  – a phenomenology beyond the human, with a 
biosemiotic basis. Roepstorff (2001: 755) acknowledges that “his outline of what 
could perhaps be called a biological phenomenology is at least as important” as his 
explicitly semiotic contribution. Tønnessen (2011a, b, 2015) has labelled phenom-
enology drawn from the Umwelt theory ‘Uexküllian phenomenology’, arguing that 
the Umwelt theory represents a genuine, novel perspective within the phenomeno-
logical tradition. According to this eco-phenomenological outlook, there are “count-
less worlds within worlds that spin in the depths of this world that we commonly 
inhabit” (Abram, 1996: 19). In this ‘more-than-human’ natural world, to borrow 
Abram’s phrase, the human being is far from alone in being a subject endowed with 
a lifeworld filled with phenomena. Unlike other phenomenal subjects, however, the 
human being is capable of conducting science, which in effect gives us some impres-
sion of and ideas about the phenomenal worlds of non-humans as well. With its 
roots in ethological research and its philosophical inclinations, the Umwelt theory 
is uniquely positioned as a suitable framework for phenomenological investigations 
into the nature of human and non-human phenomena and how they compare to each 
other. Given this comparative perspective on different Umwelten/lifeworlds, it is 
also well positioned to shed light on the way in which empirical science ultimately 
has its foundation in the human lifeworld, as Husserl (1954, 1970) stressed.
The relation between the phenomenologies of Husserl and Merleau-Ponty is 
interesting, both regarding what they have in common and regarding how they differ 
from each other. This is pertinent to mention here since the ‘Lebenswelt’ notion 
introduced by Husserl and further developed by Merleau-Ponty represents the clear-
est point of resemblance between Umwelt theory and classical phenomenology. 
After Husserl’s death, the Lebenswelt notion is widely regarded as Husserl’s most 
important contribution to phenomenology. This is the case for some of his central 
followers in phenomenology, such as Merleau-Ponty, and even more so for several 
non-philosophers inspired by Husserl. For example, the sociologists Alfred Schütz 
and Thomas Luckmann further developed the Lebenswelt notion and described how 
it could be applied in empirical sociological studies (Schütz & Luckmann, 1973). In 
health science, such as nursing research, phenomenological investigations often 
take the form of lifeworld (i.e. Lebenswelt) accounts (see Dahlberg & Drew, 1997 
for a programmatic paper and Koch, 1995 for a review of Husserl’s influence on 
nursing research).6 This might have come as a surprise to Husserl himself had he 
lived to see what shape his long-term influence was to take, given that the Lebenswelt 
notion does not play such a significant role in the writings published during his 
6 Along with Husserl’s phenomenology, Heidegger’s hermeneutics has also been influential as 
theoretical foundation for qualitative approaches within nursing science.

lifetime. As Spiegelberg (1982: 538) observes, “what Merleau-Ponty attempted was 
to go beyond Husserl by consciously extrapolating certain lines, mostly from un-­
published texts, as far as he knew them, and by playing down others in the published 
writings.” This revisionist approach to Husserl’s philosophy might make Merleau-­
Ponty and Husserl’s phenomenologies appear more similar than they in fact were. 
On the other hand, Merleau-Ponty fruitfully pinpointed promising aspects of 
Husserl’s thoughts and contributed to developing them further. This has also helped 
making Umwelt theory and phenomenology more compatible (we will return to the 
question about how similar the Lebenswelt and the Umwelt notion are in the section 
‘Consciousness’).
In the next two sections we investigate the relationship between semiotics and 
phenomenology, and phenomenology’s historical and contemporary relation to nat-
uralism. After these preparatory outlines of foundational importance, we move on to 
discuss how phenomenology treats – and could treat – the central biological phe-
nomena of subjectivity, sentience, consciousness and self-consciousness.
9.2  Semiotics and Phenomenology
For various reasons, the relation between semiotics and phenomenology is multifac-
eted and complex. The history of this relation goes back to 1902, when Charles 
Sanders Peirce (1839–1914) started conceiving of a field of study called ‘phenom-
enology’ (in English) the year after Edmund Husserl had used the term 
‘Phänomenologie’ (in German) prominently for the first time ((Husserl, 1901, see 
also Spiegelberg, 1956: 165).7 Peirce continued to use the term for the next few 
years (Stjernfelt, 2007), but eventually abandoned it for various other terms includ-
ing ‘phaneroscopy’ (Spiegelberg, 1956): 165), which is what most contemporary 
semioticians refer to when naming Peirce’s phenomenology (see also Pietarinen & 
Issajeva, 2019). Peirce did not use the term phenomenology in any paper that was 
published during his lifetime (Spiegelberg, 1956: 164) – but in the text “Minute 
logic” from 1902 (Peirce, 1931–1958: CP 2.120) he discusses “[p]henomenology, 
whose business it is simply to draw up an inventory of appearances without going 
into any investigation of their truth.” In Peirce 1903 (reprinted in Peirce, 1998 
[1893–1913]), a syllabus printed for teaching purposes, he writes about phenome-
nology that it “ascertains and studies the kinds of elements universally present in the 
phenomenon; meaning by the phenomenon, whatever is present at any time to the 
mind in any way” (ibid: 259).
As discussed by Stjernfelt (2013), semiotics and phenomenology as they are 
conceived of today both have a history of origin in which resistance to 
7 Though the term is associated with Husserl, and Husserl adopted it as the name of his brand of 
philosophy, he did not coin the term. By the time of Husserl’s adoption of the term, it had already 
been in use for more than a century, including by prominent philosophers such as Hegel and Kant 
(Spiegelberg, 1982).

psychologism was central at the outset. In Stjernfelt’s words (ibid: 2), psychologism 
is “the idea that the content and structure of thought and signs form part of the 
domain of psychology – so that the study of minds and brains forms the primary or 
even the only way of accessing these issues” (see also Kusch, 2020). An implication 
of psychologism may be “that signs and their meaning are nothing more than the 
individual psychic or neuronal phenomena supporting them or associated with 
them” (Stjernfelt, 2013: 2). In Stjernfelt’s view (ibid: 32), however,
If signs were only particular, fleeting, and shifting epiphenomena of brains and minds, this 
would not only give up signs as such as objects of scientific study, but it would, in turn, 
destroy even psychology itself along with all other sciences, because sciences, as already 
Aristotle realized, always intend general structures, even when they describe particular 
objects.
The general understanding in contemporary semiotics is that “the expression, the 
content as well of the reference of semiotic structures cannot be thus reduced to 
individual mental representations” (ibid: 3). Instead, “the sign vehicle, its content, 
and reference are seen as objective types that may, in turn, give rise to widely differ-
ing mental associations in the single sign user without those associations being 
central to the objectivity of the sign” (ibid: 3).
Stjernfelt credits anti-psychologism with having been crucial for the establish-
ment of semiotics as a field of study in its own right. “During the founding period 
of modern semiotics in the decades around 1900,” he writes (ibid: 1), “the refusal to 
take signs to be reducible to psychological phenomena was crucial for the establish-
ment of logical and semiotic phenomena and structures as autonomous objects of 
research.” This refers to Peirce’s anti-psychologism, which was particularly conse-
quential in the late phase of his authorship during which he developed his versions 
of both phenomenology and semiotics in detail (ibid: 13). In a similar way, Husserl’s 
anti-psychologism – i.e., his refusal to understand the phenomena of phenomenol-
ogy as reducible to psychological phenomena – motivated the foundation of modern 
phenomenology.
As Stjernfelt observes, the anti-psychologism of Peirce and Husserl has some 
central points of criticism in common. They both “strongly argue for a conception 
of logic, semiotics, and mathematics that is independent of the individual mind” 
(ibid: 19) and draws a distinction between individual thoughts and logical form. 
Stjernfelt remarks that this distinction “anticipates Peirce’s later distinction between 
existing Secondness and real Thirdness, just as it anticipates Husserl’s between real 
and ideal” (ibid: 12). By distinguishing the ideal from the empirically real, Husserl 
refers to the generality of the phenomena of logics, semiotics, mathematics – and 
phenomenology. This is not so different from Peirce’s conception of semiotics, in 
which signs “as identically repeatable, possess the same ideality – or generality – as 
the logical propositions constructible from signs” (ibid: 19–20).
Husserl and Peirce’s reflections on these issues concern the nature of different 
categories of phenomena, but they also concern their understanding of science gen-
erally and of different particular sciences and their relation to each other. For 
Husserl, an important point was that psychologism was in his view irreconcilable 
9.2  Semiotics and Phenomenology

with the role that logic has as foundational for science at large. “In his mature 
period, Peirce argued – just like Husserl – in the crucial two steps that (1) logic is 
primary to psychology, while, in turn, (2) phenomenology is primary to logic” (ibid: 
17). In other words, both these thinkers conceived of phenomenology as being pri-
mary and foundational with respect to psychology and any other empirical science.
There are several reasons why the parallel development of the works of Peirce 
and Husserl in this respect is of interest in the context of semiotic agency. Not only 
did both thinkers conceptualize phenomenology, they also both theorized on semi-
otic issues (cf. e.g. Husserl, 1994); see also Pietarinen et al., 2019). As part of his 
anti-psychologism, like Peirce, Husserl too thought that “semiotic issues and the 
structure of theories” were “beyond psychology” (Stjernfelt, 2013: 14). However, 
the two differed fundamentally in their view on the relation between signs and con-
sciousness. While Husserl thought that the occurrence of signs relies on conscious 
subjectivity, Peirce thought that conscious subjectivity relies on signs (Stjernfelt, 
2013: 19). In other words, unlike Husserl, who thought that conscious subjectivity 
was primary and signs secondary, Peirce thought that signs were primary and con-
scious subjectivity secondary (for a related discussion, see de Jesus, 2016).
A contemporary version of phenomenology informed by biosemiotics will not 
necessarily side with Peirce over other phenomenologists in all respects. As we will 
see in the next section, phenomenology as outlined by Peirce has limitations with 
regard to whether or not it is reconcilable with naturalized phenomenology. In con-
trast, the phenomenology of Maurice Merleau-Ponty was more interactive with the 
empirical sciences, as exemplified by his treatment of von Uexküll’s Umwelt theory 
in his lectures in the late 50s (Merleau-Ponty, 2003). Here Merleau-Ponty recog-
nizes the Umwelt as “an intermediary reality between the world such as it exists for 
an absolute observer and a purely subjective domain” (ibid: 167). “The Umwelt is 
never total”, Merleau-Ponty remarks, “we are englobed in an Umgebung that our 
Umwelt cannot englobe” (Merleau-Ponty, 2003: 178). In Merleau-Ponty’s interpre-
tation, the Umwelt “is not presented in front of the animal like a goal; it is not pres-
ent like an idea, but as a theme that haunts consciousness” (ibid.). In this conception 
of animal knowledge, Merleau-Ponty notes (ibid.), “we no longer see where behav-
ior begins and where mind ends” (for more on Merleau-Ponty’s relation to von 
Uexküll’s work, see Buchanan, 2008, for von Uexküll’s influence on philosophers 
more generally see Brentari, 2015).
The affinity between some forms of phenomenology and some forms of semiot-
ics has been noted by several authors (e.g. Lanigan, 2007; Sonesson, 2007, 2013, 
2015, 2017; Tønnessen et al., 2018; Wąsik, 2018). In cognitive semiotics, Sonesson 
and Zlatev (Zlatev, 2009, 2018) are among those who have acknowledged connec-
tions between phenomenology and semiotics but also stressed – partially in conflict 
with a biosemiotic perspective – that they do not think that all Umwelt experience 
should be regarded as phenomenological in nature. Sonesson (Sonesson, 2006) also 
stresses that the (in his view human) Lebenswelt notion should not be conflated with 
the (in his view animal) Umwelt notion.
9  Phenomenology

271
9.3  Naturalized Phenomenology
Traditionally, phenomenology has been associated with a declared anti-naturalism. 
According to Papineau (Papineau, 2020), the current usage of the term “naturalism” 
has its origin in “debates in America in the first half of the last century”, when a 
group of philosophers “aimed to ally philosophy more closely with science” by 
arguing that “reality is exhausted by nature, containing nothing ‘supernatural’”. In 
this view, “the scientific method should be used to investigate all areas of reality, 
including the ‘human spirit’”. Papineau further notes that the term has “no very 
precise meaning in contemporary philosophy”, and “is not a particularly informa-
tive term as applied to contemporary philosophers” (ibid).
In contemporary discussions, prominent phenomenologists such as Dan Zahavi 
(2004, 2010), Shaun Gallagher (2012) and Evan Thompson (2014) have called for 
a reconsideration of phenomenology’s relation to naturalism by way of the develop-
ment of a ‘naturalized phenomenology’ that is more in line with current scientific 
and philosophical thinking. In biosemiotics, Vehkavaara (2002) has similarly called 
for naturalization of semiotic concepts, and some scholars (Harney, 2015; Tønnessen 
et al., 2018) have acknowledged the efforts to naturalize phenomenology and the 
relevance of these efforts for biosemiotic theorizing.
Phenomenology’s troublesome relation to naturalism goes all the way back to 
Husserl’s early work (see also Kurtz, 1969, Ratcliffe, 2013, Suarez, 2019). Merleau-­
Ponty (2003) describes Husserl’s ambivalent attitude to naturalism. “Husserl’s 
thought”, says Merleau-Ponty (ibid: 71), “is divided between two tendencies:” 
“Overcoming the natural, naïve attitude, which does not know what it does to the 
extent that it believes in the world and is ignorant of the reasons for its belief” (this 
implies rejecting naturalism), and “an effort to understand the natural attitude in 
order to clarify it” (in Merleau-Ponty’s interpretation this implies rehabilitating 
naturalism, cf. ibid.: 72). The latter tendency in Husserl’s work eventually led him 
to describe the Lebenswelt (lifeworld) as the pre-reflexive, subjectively experienced 
world which is prior to any philosophical or scientific understanding, and the ulti-
mate source of any science or knowledge (Husserl, 1954, 1970). “The role of phe-
nomenology” is in this sense “not so much to break the bond that unites us with the 
world as to reveal it to us and explicate it” (Merleau-Ponty, 2003: 71).
“If philosophy begins with the natural attitude”, Merleau-Ponty (ibid: 79) asks, 
“will it ever leave it behind, and if it could, why would it? Such are the questions 
that bother Husserl, and which explain the contradictory positions that he took on 
the constitution of Nature.” For much of his career, Husserl was an outspoken 
defender of transcendental idealism in the form of transcendental phenomenology, 
which was presented as being fundamentally opposed to naturalism.8 In Yee’s words 
(Yee, 2019: 9), transcendental phenomenology “studies the intrinsic structures of 
8 In a similar way, through his reliance on Kant, Jakob von Uexküll has been criticized for his ideal-
ist outlook, which several contemporary semioticians with inclinations towards empirical science 
find problematic.
9.3  Naturalized Phenomenology

272
consciousness through the contents of experience that is transcendent to the struc-
tures of consciousness.” Specifically, phenomenology in this view “makes a ‘tran-
scendental’ turn away from merely attending to an object to considering the 
conditions of the object’s possibility” (ibid: 7). This is related to the fact that Husserl 
“persistently questioned the foundations of knowledge about the world” (ibid: 4). In 
the perspective of transcendental phenomenology, the task of phenomenology is to 
prepare the ground for theorizing in the empirical sciences (cf. ibid.: 5). 
Phenomenology does this by focusing “on the phenomenon as it is given to us in our 
consciousness of it (that is, given ‘originarily’), and before we reflect on it, think 
about it, conceptualize and categorize it, or explain it” (ibid: 5).
The ‘phenomenological reduction’ that Husserl suggested to use methodically 
involved suspending or setting aside “all empirical and psychological theories of 
natural science” (ibid: 12) when investigating specific phenomena. This is also 
known as making use of the phenomenological ‘epoché’ (referring to a deliberate, 
methodical suspending of judgement). The basic idea is to study the phenomenon 
“as it is” in consciousness, without making any assumptions about empirical reality, 
which is beyond consciousness. This methodology has been met with principled 
criticism from hermeneuticians, whose approach, contrary to that of Husserlian 
transcendentalism, is systematically based on contextualization. From their per-
spective, Husserl’s phenomenological reduction is unattainable because it involves 
systematically decontextualizing phenomena. Husserl’s thoughts on this point are 
also problematic from the vantage point of naturalized phenomenology, since it 
detaches phenomenological investigations from empirical sciences rather than inte-
grating them with each other. Interpreted more positively, we could say that 
Husserl’s principle of phenomenological reduction should encourage us, in our phe-
nomenological studies, to critically re-examine any beliefs we might have which 
colour our understanding of the phenomena we study.
When Merleau-Ponty refers to Husserl’s “contradictory positions […] on the 
constitution of Nature”, he refers primarily to conflicting conceptions in Husserl’s 
manuscript Ideen II, which was only published posthumously (English translation: 
Husserl, 1989).9 This can serve to illustrate the implications of Husserl’s ambivalent 
attitude to naturalism. One of Husserl’s positions in Ideen II entails that nature 
“equals Cartesian nature such as the scientists conceive it” (Merleau-Ponty, 2003: 
72). This is an “idea of the real, the in-itself, as a correlate of pure knowing, and in 
a sense for Husserl this Nature contains everything” (ibid: 73). In the same manu-
script, however, Husserl also details a quite different conception of nature, accord-
ing to which nature is “that with which I have a relation of an original and primordial 
character” (ibid: 78). In Husserl’s own words (1989: 171), in this conception nature 
is the realm of the
9 Merleau-Ponty based substantial parts of his interpretation and further development of Husserl’s 
thoughts on the latter’s unpublished manuscripts. Through visits to the Husserl Archive in Louvain, 
Merleau-Ponty had access to several of these prior to their posthumous publication.
9  Phenomenology

objects which can be primally present not just to one subject, but […] to all […] subjects 
(as soon as they are constituted). The totality of objects that can be given as primally present 
and that make up a domain of common primal presence for all communicating subjects is 
nature in the first and original sense.
Here, Husserl presents an understanding of nature that is relational and appears 
to relate to empirical sciences by making geological and evolutionary history con-
stitutionally important for perceiving organisms. “Such a philosophy of nature”, 
Merleau-Ponty remarks (ibid: 79), “was difficult to integrate into the framework of 
a transcendental idealism.” It is, however, more compatible with contemporary nat-
uralized phenomenology than more idealistic versions of Husserl’s phenome-
nology are.
We have earlier seen that Husserl favoured studying phenomena as they appear 
in consciousness without making any assumptions about their relation to empirical 
reality. Peirce defines his version of phenomenology in similar ways, a fact which is 
problematic from the standpoint of naturalized phenomenology. In 1902, Peirce 
(1931–1958: CP 2.197) writes that a “‘phenomenon’ is to be understood in the 
broadest sense conceivable; so that phenomenology might rather be defined as the 
study of what seems than as the statement of what appears. It describes the essen-
tially different elements which seem to present themselves in what seems.” Here 
Peirce even downplays the idea of phenomenology as the study of appearances by 
characterizing it instead at the study of what seems to be. On another occasion, in 
1905, at a time when he referred to ‘phaneroscopy’ rather than phenomenology, he 
writes (ibid: CP 1.284) that phaneroscopy.
is the description of the phaneron; and by the phaneron I mean the collective total of all that 
is in any way or in any sense present to the mind, quite regardless of whether it corresponds 
to any real thing or not. […] If you ask present when, and to whose mind, I reply that I leave 
these questions unanswered, never having entertained a doubt that those features of the 
phaneron that I have found in my mind are present at all times and to all minds. So far as I 
have developed this science of phaneroscopy, it is occupied with the formal elements of the 
phaneron.
Such an understanding of phenomenology is incompatible with a naturalized 
phenomenology informed by empirical sciences – and unsurprisingly, it has not 
materialized as an important field of study. As de Tienne (2004) remarks, 
“Phaneroscopy as a research activity isn’t practiced anywhere and hasn’t attracted 
any wide following […] Peirce scholars are divided about what that science is sup-
posed to be and to do, and about how exactly it relates to semiotics”. As outlined by 
Peirce, Phaneroscopy is also irreconcilable with any version of phenomenology that 
builds on Umwelt theory. Within an Uexküllian phenomenology, distinguishing 
between phenomena, i.e. Umwelt objects, that correspond to ‘real things’ (i.e. 
empirical objects) and phenomena that do not correspond to ‘real things’ (i.e. imag-
inary objects) can be highly informative and help us understand biological and 
behavioural phenomena (cf. e.g. the discussion of symbolic cat play in Tønnessen 
2009 and the discussion of ‘search images’ in Tønnessen 2018). Furthermore, 
designing phenomenology so as to study only phenomena that are “present at all 
9.3  Naturalized Phenomenology

274
times and to all minds” does not equip it to study species-specific lifeworlds with 
evolutionary histories.
In his posthumous work The crisis of European sciences and transcendental 
phenomenology, Husserl (1954), English transl. Husserl, 1970) presented the 
Lebenswelt (lifeworld) as the forgotten foundation of the sciences. In the words of 
Spiegelberg (1982: 146), Husserl’s final project was to reinvigorate science by real-
izing “that science was in fact nothing but a distillate, as it were, from the fuller 
life-world”. Husserl’s observations on this point resonate well with von Uexküll’s 
observations about scientists’ Umwelt as the ultimate source of scientific knowl-
edge as described in the final pages of Bedeutungslehre (von Uexküll, 1956 
[1934/1940]). In similar ways, and building directly on Husserl’s work, Merleau-­
Ponty (1962 [1945]: viii–ix) also called for “reawakening the basic experience of 
the world, of which science is the second-order expression”. Merleau-Ponty gener-
ally had a more positive and curious attitude to empirical sciences than Husserl did.
“It is my belief”, the contemporary eco-phenomenologist David Abram stated 
some 30 years ago (Abram, 1988: 101), “that the phenomenological investigations 
of Maurice Merleau-Ponty provide the seeds of a new and radical philosophy of 
nature that remains true to the diversity of experience within the Biosphere of this 
planet”. With this starting point, one would think that Abram, the single philosopher 
who has arguably contributed the most to contemporary eco-phenomenology, had 
developed a version of phenomenology that is compatible with naturalized phenom-
enology. However, Abram complicates his relation to empirical science by leaning 
towards animism (Abram, 1996, 2010).
“To define another being as an inert or passive object”, he writes (Abram, 1996: 
56), “is to deny its ability to actively engage us and to provoke our senses; we thus 
block our perceptual reciprocity with that being”. In itself, this is a valuable obser-
vation, and if ‘another being’ had been defined as another organism, the observation 
would be perfectly compatible with Uexküllian phenomenology. But Abram goes 
on to claim (Abram, 1996: 56) that to “the sensing body, no thing presents itself as 
utterly passive or inert.” This statement is in line with the classical Husserlian phe-
nomenological principle of studying the phenomena of lifeworlds as they appear 
prior to the influence of science and theory, and also has support in perceptual stud-
ies involving infants, oral cultures, and animal experience. A considerable problem, 
however, is that portraying all perceived objects as animate by nature, and operating 
with that perspective alone, makes the subject/object distinction collapse and thus 
having no bearing on any further analysis. There is then no room, within Abram’s 
phenomenology, for distinguishing between biotic and abiotic phenomena in scien-
tific terms. For this reason, there are clear limits to the compatibility of Abram’s 
phenomenology with Umwelt theory and with Uexküllian phenomenology. Just like 
Husserl and Peirce, Abram too ultimately restricts phenomenology to studying phe-
nomena as they appear regardless of their relation to empirical reality.
9  Phenomenology

275
9.4  Subjectivity
Given that phenomenology is devoted to studying conscious experience from a first-­
person point of view (Smith, 2018), the typical phenomenological experience that 
can be studied within this framework is intimately related to the subjectivity of the 
individual phenomenological subject. However, how the topic matter of subjectivity 
is approached by phenomenologists depends, for one thing, on whether phenome-
nology is conceived of as having an anthropocentric or a more-than-human outlook. 
Two questions to address are therefore these: Who qualifies as a subject endowed 
with subjectivity, in the view of phenomenologists? And how does this compare 
with a biosemiotic outlook? The short and preliminary answers to these questions 
are, first, that according to a phenomenological outlook any conscious organism is 
a subject endowed with subjectivity of some sort, and second, that according to a 
biosemiotic outlook some organisms that are not conscious may also be subjects 
endowed with subjectivity. In phenomenology, due to its predominant limitation to 
the human realm, issues such as individuality, intentionality and intersubjectivity in 
animals have for the most part been neglected and are seriously understudied. 
Notable exceptions involve some treatment in works by Merleau-Ponty (2003) and 
Abram (1996, 2010), and a growing but not always empirically oriented interest in 
animal perspectives in contemporary phenomenology.10
One way to approach subjectivity is to contrast subjects with objects. Throughout 
his work, Husserl applies several different notions of objecthood, according to 
Arnold (2020). He (ibid: 105) identifies five different concepts of objects that are 
“operative in Husserl’s phenomenology”. One of these defines an object as “an 
intentum, i.e. the non-subjective pole of an intentional act” (ibid: 108). This defini-
tion of objects fits well with the understanding that phenomenology is preoccupied 
only with objects that appear in consciousness. However, Husserl also refers to 
objects as “‘something’ […] on which all other, non-formal characterisations rest” 
(a formal concept of objects), “something which can be counted or can be an ele-
ment of a set” (a numerical concept of objects), “the ‘substrate of possible predica-
tions’” (a logical concept of objects), or “something that is real or ideal” (an 
existential concept of objects) (ibid: 108). While none of these are necessarily 
incompatible with the understanding that phenomenology is preoccupied only with 
objects that appear in consciousness, they do not relate directly to the subjecthood 
of experiencing organisms, except insofar as these four concepts of objects, too, are 
objects of thoughts in the human consciousness.
In a biosemiotic perspective, subjectivity is a core feature of most if not all 
organisms (some of which may be endowed with diffuse or distributed forms of 
subjectivity rather than coherent organismic subjectivity). In consequence of this, in 
a biosemiotic understanding the realm of subjectivity is not restricted to, or identical 
with, the realm of consciousness. Whereas consciousness always has an aspect of 
10 The latter thus mostly takes the form of ‘philosophical phenomenology’ without being properly 
informed by ‘scientific phenomenology’ in this context.
9.4  Subjectivity

276
involving subjectivity, non-conscious subjectivity also occurs, in several species. 
This contrasts with the usual phenomenological perspective, which is only preoc-
cupied with consciousness, and also contrasts with the anti-subjectivist tendencies 
in the phenomenologies of Husserl and Peirce, with their principled focus on how 
“the same” objects appear to different phenomenological subjects. As this simple 
contrasting shows, biosemiotics applies ideas about subjectivity more widely than 
classical phenomenology does. In order to explain the progression in evolutionary 
or classificatory terms from less to more subjective lifeforms, the biosemiotic point 
of view requires an introduction of finer distinctions within the realm of 
subjectivity.
A possible way to frame degrees of and progression in subjectivity is by way of 
Jesper Hoffmeyer’s notion of semiotic freedom (Hoffmeyer, 1996), which refers to 
the depth and range of meaning an organism is capable of relating to. The greater 
semiotic freedom an organism has in this sense, the more subjective is it. Organisms 
capable of relating complexly to meaning are more semiotically complex, and for 
those organisms that make use of cognition we can state that they are thus also more 
cognitively complex than cognitive organisms that relate to meaning in less com-
plex ways. “Semiotic freedom (or interpretance)”, as Hoffmeyer (2010: 164) argues, 
“allows a system to ‘read’ many sorts of ‘cues’ in the surroundings, and this would 
normally have beneficial effects on fitness.” While a general progression in the his-
tory of life towards more complex organisms might be hard to prove by other mea-
sures, “it is quite obvious that semiotic complexity or freedom has indeed attained 
higher levels in later stages, advanced species of birds and mammals in general 
being semiotically much more sophisticated than less advanced species” (ibid., with 
reference to (Hoffmeyer, 1996). “Allowing for semiotic freedom in the organic 
world”, Hoffmeyer (2010: 164) argues, “significantly changes the task of explaining 
emergent evolution, because semiotic freedom has a self-amplifying dynamic.” 
Relatedly, Hoffmeyer’s notion of ‘semiotic causation’, which concerns “the bring-
ing about of changes under the guidance of interpretation” (Hoffmeyer, 2008: 149), 
makes clear how semiotic freedom is related to organisms’ choice-making and has 
real-life consequences, with the most subjective organisms having the greatest influ-
ence on their surroundings (cf. also Chap. 11, Human agency and ecology).
In his work with developing the Umwelt theory, von Uexküll (1921) initially 
theorized that all organisms have an Umwelt. In his last and most mature work, 
however, Bedeutungslehre, published in 1940, he stated that whereas animals, 
humans and unicellular organisms have an Umwelt, plants and fungi instead have 
what he called Wohnhüllen (dwelling-worlds; (von Uexküll, 1956 [1934/1940]). In 
this conception, plants and fungi relate to signs, i.e., engage in biosemiosis, and 
have a form of semiotic agency, but they are not properly speaking subjects in the 
same way as organisms endowed with an Umwelt are. The crucial difference, in von 
Uexküll’s depiction, is that there are no functional cycles at work in Wohnhüllen, 
and thus no distinct actions carried out by plants and fungi either. However, a 
Wohnhülle can, on par with an Umwelt, be understood as an individual/organismic 
lifeworld which partakes in the phenomenal world at large (Tønnessen et al., 2016: 
145), and in this sense plants and fungi, too, are phenomenological subjects. It 
9  Phenomenology

would however be more precise to characterize them as quasi-subjects than as 
proper subjects, and their subjectivity is of a more diffuse and distributed character 
than the subjectivity of humans, animals and unicellular organisms.11
The difference between a biosemiotic view and a simplistic phenomenological 
view on the phenomenal complexity of organisms is shown in Fig. 9.1. In this sim-
plistic phenomenological view, which several if not a majority of contemporary 
phenomenologists hold, only human beings experience and relate to phenomena.12 
This might further be seen as a precondition for e.g. free will and subjectivity, which 
may in consequence in this view also be uniquely human features. A major problem 
is then to explain how such complex phenomena as human beings are capable of 
experiencing and relate to can come about, without anything in nature resembling it 
the slightest. In a biosemiotic view, in contrast, there is continuity between the phe-
nomena that simple organisms experience and relate to, and those that complex 
organisms, including human beings, can experience and relate to. In this view, phe-
nomenal complexity is a graded phenomenon. While all organisms experience and 
relate to phenomena, the phenomena that human beings relate to are vastly more 
complex than those that simple organisms relate to, and human beings relate to 
phenomena in much more complex ways. These two divergent views on phenome-
nal complexity may (or may not) converge in a similar understanding of human 
phenomena.
Naturally, several nuances should be introduced in describing the varieties of 
subjectivity displayed by different organisms that are endowed with an Umwelt (see 
e.g. discussion in Tønnessen et al., 2018). As mentioned, Hoffmeyer’s notion of 
semiotic freedom is suitable for indicating semiotic, cognitive and phenomenologi-
cal complexity. In relation to Fig. 9.1, a reasonable interpretation of the biosemiotic 
11 It should be noted that the fact that unicellular organisms are proper subjects in this sense whereas 
plants and fungi are quasi-subjects does not imply that plants and fungi are less semiotically and 
phenomenologically complex than unicellular organisms. Usually, they engage in more complex 
biosemiosis.
12 Their denial of any phenomena experienced by animals may be consistent with their possible 
acknowledgement of animal consciousness and subjectivity, provided that they regard only reflec-
tive self-consciousness as the subject matter of phenomenology and regard the human species as 
the only species endowed with reflective self-consciousness.

view on phenomenal complexity is that increasing phenomenal complexity tends to 
be correlated with increasing semiotic freedom and increasingly complex forms of 
semiotic causation. In a similar vein, increasing phenomenal complexity also tends 
to be correlated with increasingly complex forms of subjectivity.
In the following, some key steps towards increasing cognitive complexity are 
treated, starting with sentience and continuing with consciousness and eventually 
self-consciousness.
9.5  Sentience
Having sentience is often equated with being endowed with consciousness (see van 
Gulick, 2018), but is also associated with the ability to experience qualitative states. 
Within a moral context, the focus is usually on the capacity for feeling e.g. pleasure 
and pain. In this more specific sense, being sentient concerns having a life that can 
be experienced as either good or bad. These moral aspects of sentience are relevant 
e.g. for phenomenological investigations within the fields of psychology, health and 
social studies, and for phenomenological investigations that make connections with 
issues within animal ethics.
While sentience is related to conscious experience, it also specifically relates to 
sensation and perception. It is in this context worth noting how Merleau-Ponty’s 
phenomenology differs from Husserl’s phenomenology in how it relates to percep-
tion. As explained by Spiegelberg (1982): 560), Merleau-Ponty’s thesis on the ‘pri-
macy of perception’ “simply means that perception constitutes the ground level for 
all knowledge, and that its study has to precede that of all other strata such as those 
of the cultural world and specifically that of science.” Merleau-Ponty’s philosophy 
about perception was thus “a phenomenology of the world as perceived rather than 
of the perceiving act” (ibid: 560–561), which in contrast was Husserl’s main focus. 
Husserl approached perception first of all as an act of consciousness. In Merleau-­
Ponty’s outlook, “perception emerges as the act designed to trace elementary mean-
ing as actually already present in the world prior to our interpretations. This 
emphasis on meaning as discovered, not bestowed by investing acts, is certainly 
new, though it is not an absolute innovation” (ibid: 563). This gives Merleau-Ponty’s 
phenomenology an affinity with philosophical realism and makes it compatible with 
empirical sciences. Again, we see how Merleau-Ponty’s work is the one among the 
classics in phenomenology that resembles von Uexküll’s outlook the most.
It is often asserted that von Uexküll built the Umwelt theory on Kant’s philoso-
phy, and there is some truth to this claim. Von Uexküll related first and foremost to 
Kant’s Critique of pure reason (Kant, 1914 [1790]) – notably, he adopted Kant’s 
term ‘Erscheinungswelt’ (phenomenal world, or literally ‘world of appearances’), 
and his notion that all reality is subjective appearance, i.e. relative to some subject 
(von Uexküll, 1928: 2). However, when Kant wrote about the phenomenal world, he 
regarded only human beings as phenomenal subjects, just like he in his treatments 
of rationality restricted himself to studying human rationality. In the introduction to 
9  Phenomenology

279
Theoretische Biologie, von Uexküll (ibid: 9, translated here by M. Tønnessen) made 
clear not only how the Umwelt theory builds on Kant’s outlook, but also how it dif-
fers from it:
[t]he task of biology consists in expanding the lessons of Kant’s research in two directions: 
1. to take into account the role of our bodies, particularly our sense organs and our central 
nervous system, and 2. to study other subjects’ (the animal’s) relations to objects.
Von Uexküll’s two modifications of Kant’s perspective makes the Umwelt theory 
focused on embodied minds and principally non-anthropocentric where Kant’s 
approach was less focused on bodily aspects and clearly anthropocentric. It is also 
worth noting that von Uexküll, in his acknowledgement of the embodied nature of 
minds, established such a notion well before Maurice Merleau-Ponty (1962 [1945]) 
did. An important feature of the Uexküllian understanding of embodied mind is that 
the lifeworld of an organism is what connects the phenomenological subject with 
physical reality. The subject and its relevant environment are in a sense indistin-
guishable, to the effect that we should conceive of the organism-in-its-environment 
as a whole rather than think of organisms and their environment as separate entities. 
Likewise, we should conceive of mind as an embodied phenomenon, since any 
mind is intimately associated with a body with specific sensory capacities and a 
specific repertoire of actions, and the affordances of a specific physical environment.
As already indicated, sentience is a feature, or capacity, of animals that is often 
referred to as particularly relevant for moral consideration in animal ethics (see e.g. 
Regan, 2004). For the utilitarianist Peter Singer (1975), sentience, understood as the 
capacity for feeling pleasure and pain, is the morally relevant property, and the dis-
tinguishing feature of any individual worthy of moral consideration. Phenomenologist 
David Abram for his part focuses on the role our human sentience has for “our 
carnal, sensorial empathy” with non-humans and nature, stating that a new environ-
mental ethic may emerge “through a renewed attentiveness to this perceptual dimen-
sion that underlies all our logics” (Abram, 1996: 69).
Tønnessen and Beever (2014) agree that sentience is a morally relevant property, 
and of particular concern within animal ethics, but argues that sentience is just a 
special case of biosemiosis, which is more broadly what is morally relevant, par-
ticularly in the context of environmental ethics. Semiotic agency, i.e., the capacity 
for making use of signs, is in this biosemiotic perspective a more basic and more 
fundamental capacity than sentience, though sentience is an advanced form of semi-
otic agency and as such important in its own right. Framed phenomenologically this 
biosemiotic approach to ethics can be taken to imply that it is ultimately the biose-
miosis which underpins sentience that makes sentient organisms subjects of the 
phenomenological world at large.
9.5  Sentience

280
9.6  Consciousness
There is no general consensus about how consciousness should be defined or con-
ceptualized, although it is clearly about mental phenomena (van Gulick, 2018). 
When the term is applied to whole organisms, we are concerned with creature con-
sciousness; when it is applied to mental states or processes, we are dealing with 
what is called state consciousness. Depending on the definition of consciousness, a 
creature can be said to be conscious e.g. if it is sentient, if it is wakeful (awake and 
alert), if it is self-conscious, if there is something that it is like to be this creature (cf. 
Nagel, 1974), if it is a subject of conscious states, or if it is conscious about various 
things. A conscious state, in its turn, may be e.g. a state one is aware of, a qualitative 
state, a phenomenal state, or a state with narrative elements (van Gulick, 2018). 
Phenomenal states are associated with ‘phenomenal consciousness’, which van 
Gulick (ibid.) notes “is perhaps more properly applied to the overall structure of 
experience”.
As Allen and Trestman (2017) point out, “[q]uestions about animal conscious-
ness” — in particular, which animals have consciousness and what (if anything) that 
consciousness might be like — are both scientific and philosophical.” In conse-
quence, progress in our understanding of animal consciousness will “require inter-
disciplinary work by philosophers willing to engage with the empirical details of 
animal biology, as well as scientists who are sensitive to the philosophical com-
plexities of the issue.” The philosophical aspects of the questions include phenom-
enological dimensions – and as we have seen, consciousness-related issues are the 
core interest of phenomenologists as conventionally defined.
In Husserl’s work, there is a clear connection between his late development of 
the Lebenswelt notion and the phenomenological subject’s relation to conscious-
ness. “Consciously we always live in the life-world” Husserl (1970: 379) wrote. In 
this conception, subjective experience is intimately related to consciousness and 
how we consciously navigate our lifeworld, which is where and how ‘the world’ 
appears to us, in Husserl’s final but unfinished version of phenomenology. 
“Conscious of the world as a horizon,” Husserl wrote (ibid: 379), “we live for our 
particular ends, whether as momentary and changing ones or as an enduring goal 
that guides us.”
The Umwelt notion of von Uexküll and the Lebenswelt notion of Husserl are 
interrelated and overlap, and they were developed around the same time. However, 
while Husserl had the chance to read much but not all of von Uexküll’s work on the 
Umwelt notion, von Uexküll did not have any chance to read Husserl’s most mature 
work on the Lebenswelt notion, since these texts were only published posthumously. 
As noted by Tønnessen (2011b: 27), the.
version of The Crisis that was published in Husserl’s lifetime was published in 1936, two 
years after Uexküll’s book Streifzüge durch die Umwelten von Tieren und Menschen and 
four years before Bedeutungslehre (see von Uexküll, 1956 [1934/1940]), Uexküll’s last 
major work – but notably with the drafted sections about the Lebenswelt omitted. Two years 
later Husserl died, and ten years before the drafts on the Lebenswelt were published post-
humously as part of an expanded version of The Crisis in 1954, Uexküll died.
9  Phenomenology

281
Spiegelberg’s only mention of von Uexküll and the Umwelt notion in his book 
The Phenomenological Movement: A Historical Introduction (Spiegelberg, 1982) 
concerns Husserl’s development of the Lebenswelt notion. What Husserl sought to 
capture with the Lebenswelt notion was according to Spiegelberg (ibid: 146).
the world as experienced by a living subject in his particular perspective, however distorted, 
hence clearly a subjective and relative affair. The only form in which this concept had found 
entrance into science was that of a subjective environment (Umwelt) as introduced into 
animal psychology especially by Jakob von Uexküll.
An important question in the light of Umwelt theory, which with its methodol-
ogy for studying a variety of species-specific lifeworlds is pluralistic by design, is 
whether Husserl’s Lebenswelt notion was intended to be applied only on human 
lifeworlds, or on animal lifeworlds too. In many contexts Husserl refers only to 
humans and their conscious experience, and there is no doubt that this is primarily 
what Husserl was concerned with. But in some cases, he made explicit mention of 
animal lifeworlds. In one of the texts included as an appendix to the posthumous 
version of The crisis, Husserl (1970: 331) thus discusses a new attitude.
toward men and animals not as bodies to be investigated consistently and descriptively in 
the attitude oriented towards nature but as men (or animals) who have their bodies as living 
bodies, who have their personal surrounding world [Umwelt], oriented around their living 
bodies as the near-far world.
The most reasonable interpretation of this statement is that Husserl acknowl-
edged that animals, on par with humans, are endowed with an Umwelt in von 
Uexküll’s sense.13 The question of how the Umwelt notion relates to the Lebenswelt 
notion, however, remains. This is clarified in another passage (ibid: 238, our empha-
sis), where Husserl writes:
As the correlative abstraction teaches us, man (and everything else that is real in animal 
form) is, after all, something real having two strata and is given as such in pure experience, 
purely in the life-world [Lebenswelt] […] The individual psychology must, then, be the 
foundation for a sociology and likewise for a science of objectified spirit (of cultural things), 
which after all refers, in its own way, to the human being as person, i.e., to the life of the 
soul. And all this can be applied by analogy – just as far as the analogy reaches – to ani-
mals, to animal society, to the surrounding world [Umwelt] with its specifically animal 
signification.
Here Husserl makes two claims that are important in our context: (1) that animals 
too are “given […] in pure experience, purely in the life-world [Lebenswelt]”, and 
(2) that his philosophy of the Lebenswelt “can be applied by analogy – just as far as 
the analogy reaches – to animals […] to the surrounding world [Umwelt] with its 
specifically animal signification.” Although the Umwelt notion and the Lebenswelt 
notion are not identical or of identical range (amongst other things because von 
Uexküll applied the Umwelt notion to some non-conscious organisms, such as 
13 In Husserl (1970) ‘Umwelt’ is consistently translated as ‘surrounding world’, cf. ibid.: 6, foot-
note. Although ‘Umwelt’ is also the German word for ‘environment’, in the quotation Husserl 
appears to use the term in von Uexküll’s sense rather than in the common sense.
9.6  Consciousness

282
unicellular organisms), they clearly overlap, and Husserl himself saw them as 
interrelated.
A crucial difference between the two notions is that whereas von Uexküll with 
the Umwelt notion favoured Pluralism (in the terminology of (Jaroš & Maran, 
2019), Husserl arguably favoured Gradualism, the idea that humans have superior 
faculties but that there is continuity between animal and human capabilities.14 In this 
outlook, acknowledgement of the existence of animal Lebenswelten and Umwelten 
may imply that these too are worthy study objects within phenomenology, in so far 
as they involve conscious experience, although they may only be of interest to the 
extent that they resemble the human Lebenswelt (this appears to have been Husserl’s 
view). Within the classification of Jaroš & Maran, Heidegger must rather be under-
stood to favour Transformativism, the view that humans have superior faculties with 
there being discontinuity between animal and human capabilities (ibid: 385). In 
Heidegger’s view, therefore, the fact that several animals are endowed with con-
sciousness, and with an Umwelt, does not prove that the thesis that the phenomeno-
logical world at large is pluralistic by nature is correct.
On a final note, although initially focused on individual experience, phenome-
nology has developed to address social aspects of phenomena as well (for an over-
view, see Mulligan, 2001). Due to its anthropocentric heritage, however, no similar 
emphasis has been given to social aspects of phenomena in animals, even though 
animals too evidently operate with social structures. On this point phenomenology’s 
contributions to studies of animal consciousness to date is insufficient and underde-
veloped and needs elaboration and new research in dialogue with more established 
approaches to animal consciousness. What further phenomenological studies in this 
direction can contribute with is e.g. a better understanding of animal 
intersubjectivity.
9.7  Self-Consciousness
The contemporary phenomenologists Gallagher and Zahavi (2019) distinguish 
between pre-reflective self-consciousness and reflective self-consciousness, with 
the former being primary and underlying any kind of conscious experience. Pre-­
reflective self-consciousness concerns “an implicit and first-order awareness” and 
“is related to the idea that experiences have a subjective ‘feel’ to them” (ibid.). 
Gallagher and Zahavi indicate that phenomenologists “are in close to unanimous 
agreement about the idea that the experiential dimension always involves such an 
implicit pre-reflective self-awareness”, and observe that an “implication of this is 
obviously that the self-consciousness in question is so fundamental and basic that it 
can be ascribed to all creatures that are phenomenally conscious, including various 
non-human animals.” This understanding also implies that being endowed with 
14 The same can probably be said about (Merleau-Ponty, 1962 [1945]).
9  Phenomenology

283
pre-reflective self-consciousness is a necessary, but not a sufficient condition for 
being endowed with reflective self-consciousness. “Many animals who possess pre-­
reflective self-consciousness”, Gallagher and Zahavi (ibid.) state, “obviously lack 
the cognitive resources needed for reflective self-ascriptions.”
So-called ‘mindreading’ is by many considered to be crucial to the human form 
of consciousness, and to have significant implications for human sociality. According 
to Ravenscroft (2019) mindreading rests on “an important set of human cognitive 
capacities” where the capacities involved “are almost always assumed to be closely 
related, perhaps in virtue of their being produced by a single underlying cognitive 
mechanism.” Human mindreading involves.
	1.	 The capacity to predict human behavior in a wide range of circumstances.
	2.	 The capacity to attribute mental states to humans.
	3.	 The capacity to explain the behavior of humans in terms of their possessing 
mental states. (Ravenscroft, 2019)
The capacity for mindreading is sometimes referred to as having a ‘theory of 
mind’, with the implication that those individuals or species that have a theory of 
mind are able to understand and relate to the mental states of other individuals. This 
can involve understanding the beliefs, desires, and intentions of others. While opin-
ions differ on whether or not any non-human species have a theory of mind, the 
common understanding is that all normally functioning adult human beings have a 
full-fledged theory of mind, i.e. are capable of mindreading, and that this capacity 
normally appears and develops during childhood. However, there are also discus-
sions about ‘marginal cases’ involving human beings who are not (fully) capable of 
mindreading (cf. our discussion of marginal cases of humans in Chap. 3). Some 
individuals with high-functioning autism or Asperger syndrome, for instance, “often 
possess a late-acquired, explicit theory of mind, which appears to be the result of 
effortful learning” (Frith & Happé, 1999: 1). Depending on how strictly reflective 
self-consciousness is defined, it is reasonable, in our view, to acknowledge that 
some animals too are self-conscious in a sense that involves reflectivity. At any rate, 
the reflective self-consciousness of human beings stands out by being intimately 
associated with the human capacity for language. As Abram (1996) narrates in The 
spell of the sensuous. Perception and language in a more-than-human world, the 
transition in human history from oral cultures to alphabetic cultures has likely had 
profound effects on how humans perceive the world. In Abram’s words (ibid: 112), 
“the literate self cannot help but feel its own transcendence and timelessness relative 
to the fleeting world of corporeal experience”. By using ancient Hebrew and Greek 
culture as case studies, Abram demonstrates how the emergence of written lan-
guages is associated with consequential changes in how we think, believe, and per-
ceive. Our linguistic capabilities are truly unique, and their very uniqueness may 
have deceived us into disregarding anything non-linguistic and thus thinking that 
our capacity for self-conscious reflectivity is more unique than it really is.
Abram is also concerned with the ways in which technology has the potential to 
further alienate or decouple human beings from ecological reality in perceptual and 
experiential terms, in effect making us neglect the fact that we are materially 
9.7  Self-Consciousness

284
embedded in nature. “Today”, Abram (1996: ix) notes, “we participate almost 
exclusively with other humans and with our own human-made technology.” This 
has led to “a strange inability to clearly perceive other animals – a real inability to 
clearly see, or focus upon, anything outside the realm of human technology, or to 
hear as meaningful anything other than human speech” (ibid: ix). Our modern hab-
its of “manipulating abstract symbols” – increasingly on screens – “while our mus-
cled body is mostly inert” (Abram, 2010: 189) has also contributed to detaching 
thinking from bodily activities, unlike e.g. in oral cultures where stories are told as 
one walks through ancestral lands (as retold by Abram, 1996), or the custom of 
lecturing and discussing while walking in the peripatetic school of Aristotle.
While there are ongoing scientific and philosophical discussions about to what 
extent some animals, too, display self-consciousness, there is little doubt that our 
specifically human form of reflective self-consciousness distinguishes human expe-
rience and our capacity for taking action to shape the world according to our prefer-
ences and agendas. In this sense the human being is indeed “world-forming”, as 
Heidegger (1995) claimed on a more abstract level. Sartre (1958) gave this human 
exceptionalist outlook an existentialist orientation and emphasized that human 
beings must make radical choices to choose who we want to be. In a biosemiotic 
outlook, however, the emergence of free will in humans must be understood on the 
background of an evolutionary history of increasing semiotic freedom (Hoffmeyer, 
1996), and we cannot legitimately characterize other sentient living beings as 
entirely bereft of free will or world-forming abilities.

Composite Agency
Abstract  In this chapter we argue that the multiplicity of subagents is a typical 
feature of agency which is necessary for a higher-level agent’s reliable self-­
construction, robustness, and adaptability. The composite organization allows for a 
dialectic balance between interests and functions of the whole and its parts. We 
argue that subagents are semi-autonomous and coexist in a partially cooperative, 
partially antagonistic unity that evolves over time. They generate adaptive varia-
tions of structures and functions that help organisms to improve performance and/or 
survive severe environmental changes. Subagents interact at both physiological and 
evolutionary time scales. One interaction strategy is guiding semiogenesis, which 
happens when one subagent provides scaffolding that facilitates, represses, or re-­
directs the evolution or learning of another subagent. Composite agents emerge 
either via integration of homogenous components, i.e. reproduction of identical 
low-level agents without separation followed by specialization, or symbiogenesis, 
i.e. integration of diverse low-level agents into a symbiotic community followed by 
co-adaptation. The long-term future fate of specific composite agents is fundamen-
tally uncertain, and this gives rise to a “mixed identity”. In some cases, agents can 
acquire subagents (e.g., genes or symbionts) from other organisms. Some subagents 
may break free, infect other agents, or kill their host organism.
10.1  The Composite Nature of Agents
Any living organism encompasses a multitude of subagents. A human body has ~30 
trillion cells (Sender et al., 2016), and the human brain has 86 billion neurons, i.e. 
nerve cells (Herculano-Houzel, 2009). Each cell in turn includes about 21,000 
protein-­coding genes and  >  18,000 non-coding genes (ENCODE Consortium, 
2012). The human genome further includes ca. 5 million transposable elements, of 
which 0.7 million are retro-viral fragments (Treangen & Salzberg, 2011). The 
human body is a consortium of many biological species that are linked via symbio-
sis, commensalism, and parasitism relationships. This means that the human body 
is in effect a holobiont (Gilbert et al., 2012). And the human body is not unique in 

292
this regard. There is no eukaryotic organism that does not encompass symbionts or 
parasites.
Organisms perform a large variety of living functions, and each function requires 
specific tools and regulatory networks. A single agent cannot be equally efficient in 
executing all these tasks simultaneously; it needs sub-agents for performing indi-
vidual tasks. For example, a single-cell ciliate Paramecium (infusoria) has numer-
ous organelles that are dedicated to specific functions (Fig.  10.1). The gullet is 
needed for feeding and making food vacuoles, which are responsible for food diges-
tion. Undigested particles are removed from the cell at the anal pore. Osmosis is 
regulated by contractile vacuoles. Cilia on the surface are used for locomotion, 
whereas trichocysts are used as weapons for self-defense. Many cilates carry photo-
receptors that help them in navigation and avoiding direct sunlight. The micronu-
cleus is the main storage of genetic information (chromosomes), whereas the 
macronucleus carries multiple copies of actively transcribed chromosome fragments.
All organelles have autonomous functions and employ self-regulating signaling 
networks  – they therefore qualify as subagents. For example, the discharge of 
trichocysts in Paramecium is mediated by local calcium-dependent mechanisms 
(Plattner, 2015). Similarly, food vacuoles are autonomous and regulate all stages of 
digestion (Ramoino et al., 1996).
The role of subagents is not limited to their everyday tasks; it may also include 
potentially life-saving activities induced in emergency situations. For example, bac-
teria have a variety of detoxifying metabolic pathways (e.g., esterases, hydrolases, 
dehydrochlorinases, amidases, oxireductases) that can be utilized for degrading for-
eign chemicals, including some that they have never previously encountered (e.g., 
synthetic antibiotics and pesticides) (Russell et al., 2011). Some insects thus benefit 
from the detoxifying capacity of symbiotic bacteria when exposed to pesticides

(Kikuchi et al., 2012). Because symbiotic bacteria reproduce much faster than their 
eukaryotic host organisms, they can adapt to detoxify novel chemicals faster than 
their hosts can.
Individual organisms play the role of subagents in multi-organism agents, which 
include colonies of social insects, populations, species, ecological communities, 
and human social units from families to organizations and cultures. For example, a 
colonial animal called siphonophore consists of many jelly fish-like individuals 
(Fig. 10.2a). Another example is a termite colony living in a mound – a product of 
the cooperative work of several millions of insects (Fig. 10.2b). The mould can be 
up to 5 m tall, and a large portion of it is used for farming a symbiotic fungus which 
grows on grass remnants that is collected by termites around the nest. Biologist 
Scott Turner (2000) describes termite moulds as “living architecture”. And a termite 
nest is indeed a dynamic structure: it takes several years to build, and needs to be 
repaired after each heavy rainfall. Termites detect damages based on the change of 
carbon dioxide concentration and air flow inside the nest. They then fill their mouths 
with mud and rush to the problem area, where they use mud to patch the hole in 
the wall.
Finally, the third example is the International Space Station with its crew 
(Fig. 10.2c). The Station is the product of the work of thousands of people. It is 
inhabited by up to 6 people at a time and can also house experimental animals and 
plants. The presence of people is essential for managing the station, communicating 
with Earth, and conducting experiments.

10.1  The Composite Nature of Agents

10.2  Interaction of Subagents
Several approaches can be taken to classifying interactions between subagents. 
First, we can distinguish between material and semiotic interactions. Material inter-
actions have only material consequences, where an agent, for example, contributes 
to the synthesis of resources, tools, and scaffolds that are shared with other sub-
agents. Material interactions encompass e.g. assembly, destruction, or binding to 
other subagents. In contrast, semiotic interactions generate some form of semiosis, 
such as the interpretation of signs produced by other subagents, a production of 
signs that may affect the activity of other subagents, and communication. Examples 
of semiotic interactions include signal transduction pathways inside living cells that 
convert sensing signals generated by chemoreceptors into regulatory signals that 
control gene expression in the nucleus, hormonal regulation of organs in animals, 
and pheromone communication between individuals in a colony of ants. Many 
actual interactions display a combination of semiotic and material components, and 
often these are equally important. For example, macrophages first recognize patho-
gens or infected cells via semiotic interaction, and then physically destroy them via 
material interaction.
Interaction between subagents is goal-driven. The goals of subagents are mostly 
consistent with the goals of the whole organism, and this consistency is needed for 
forming and maintaining cooperative relations between subagents. For example, 
animals in dangerous situations produce adrenaline in order to activate energy pro-
duction and succeed in a fight-or-flight response. In target cells, adrenaline activates 
systems that produce calcium, and calcium in turn serves as a signal for mitochon-
dria to activate oxidative phosphorylation and generate a large amount of energy in 
the form of ATP (Luongo et al., 2015). Since mitochondria survive and reproduce 
only within host organisms, it is beneficial for them to provide host cells with ATP 
when energy is demanded.
In antagonistic interactions, one of the subagents can modify the goals of its host 
or partner. For example, the single-cell parasites Toxoplasma gondii change the 
behavior of infected mice, which become attracted to cats’ urine (Ingram et al., 
2013). This response is apparently beneficial for the parasites, because infected 
mice are more likely to be eaten by cats, and these parasites can reproduce sexually 
only within cats. Similarly, the parasitic fly Apocephalus borealis can change the 
behavior of infected honeybees. Larvae of this parasite reprogram the brain of bees 
to distal dispersal, which facilitates the dispersal of the parasite (Core et al., 2012).
Teleology, or more specifically the pursuing of purposes, is the main reason why 
agency exists as a whole system. The goals of subagents are not isolated tasks but 
associated back with the goals of the organism. As we see, subagents can perform 
higher-level functions – the functions of the organism. This means that an organism 
exists as a higher-level agent even if its functions are performed by subagents.
The notion that a subagent can represent a higher-level agency by performing its 
functions contradicts the principle of hierarchy which is typical for the mechanistic 
worldview. Such a switch of roles and participatory activity requires plasticity in 
10  Composite Agency

agential organization which is called heterarchy – a system where the different parts 
have flexible ranks in terms of their regulation capacities. The concept of heterarchy 
was proposed by Warren McCulloch (1945) in relation to nervous networks. It has 
later been applied to various fields of biology, social studies, and biosemiotics 
(Bruni & Giorgi, 2016).
The functions of subagents can be ranked by the degree with which their current 
goals match with (or support) the goals of an organism. The ranking can change 
during development or in stress situations. But there are also some stable patterns in 
subagent ranking. For example, brain neurons generally have a higher rank than 
their target cells in the muscles, gut, or skin. Similarly, hormone glands normally 
have a higher rank than target organs. Relative to these ranks, the interactions 
between subagents can be classified into lateral, top-down, and bottom-up. Lateral 
interactions are those that are not momentarily controlled by a higher-level agency, 
whereas top-down and bottom-up interactions are directed either from a higher-­
level agency to its subagents or vice versa, respectively. An example of a top-down 
regulation is nerve signals traveling from the brain to other organs, whereas nerve 
signals traveling from sensory organs to the brain exemplify bottom-up interactions. 
Lateral interactions typically support local processes such as calcium release in the 
muscles or heart.
10.3  Benefits of Modularity
There seem to be no immediate advantage to a composite agent as compared to an 
agent that has no autonomous subagents. All functions can be controlled from a 
single center based on incoming sensorial inputs, and yet, organisms always consist 
of partially autonomous subagents and do not use exclusively centralized control 
systems. A question therefore naturally arises: Why are living agents composite?
Some answers come from the technology of complex artificial systems including 
engineering, robotics, and programming. The main principle of designing such sys-
tems is modularity, which means partitioning the whole mechanism into semi-­
autonomous modules and minimizing the central control. Modularity in technical 
agents means that subagents (modules) are characterized by a number of features. 
The first of them is self-governing – a capacity to monitor the internal state and the 
state of the local environment, and to initiate actions when this is necessary to pur-
sue the goals of a module. Second, the functional core of each module is protected 
from external disturbances via isolation, compensation, and possibly, error-­
correction and self-repair. Third, modules provide an easy-to-use interface for inter-
action with other modules and with external agents. Simplification of an interface is 
achieved by increasing the internal complexity that is hidden inside each module. 
Finally, the fourth feature is security, which involves protection against external 
break-ins and non-authorized agential activities.
It appears that living systems use similar principles of modularity, and organize 
accordingly. The term ‘modularity’ has been adopted in developmental and 
10.3  Benefits of Modularity

molecular biology (Schlosser, 2004). In this context, subagents in organisms are 
similar to technical modules in that they are self-governed, protected from distur-
bances, and provide easily operated interfaces for interaction with other subagents. 
The security of organisms is supported mostly by the immune system.
Gerhard Schlosser (2004) advocates a process-oriented understanding of mod-
ules in development and evolution. An organism is in his view just a snapshot of a 
continuous life-cycle process which involves a sequence of interactions between 
organs, cells, and intracellular components with their respective environments 
within and outside of organism boundaries. Schlosser wrote: “Modules can be char-
acterized as those types of subprocesses that are integrated and relatively autono-
mous” (ibid: 520). By ‘integration’ he refers to the essential role of interactions 
within components of a module for the function of the whole module, whereas 
‘autonomy’ refers to the relative independence of the input-output relations in a 
module from the changes in other modules. The components of a module are not 
necessarily physically integrated, instead they can be distributed in space and keep 
their functional integrity via distal communication (e.g., in neural networks) or by 
transient interactions (e.g., immune cells). Modules are often organized into 
domains, where the same input-output rule has multiple instantiations:
For example, hedgehog [gene] signaling is activated in many floor plate cells of the devel-
oping vertebrate spinal cord, but they all form a single domain, because they all depend on 
induction from the notochord. (ibid: 526)
The first benefit of modularity is easy to grasp – this concerns speed. If an agent 
is complex enough and it is operated by a single control unit, then the control unit 
becomes a bottleneck for incoming signals. The performance of computers, for 
example, depends on their CPU clock. The only way to increase the speed of signal 
handling is to allow parallel processing and manage signals locally where possible. 
The computer industry has already switched to parallel processors, but the number 
of individual processors (cores) generally remains small. Only in graphics process-
ing units (GPUs), the number of cores is increased to a few thousand. Although 
individual biological processes are slower than in computers, organisms avoid sig-
naling bottlenecks as a result of the enormous scale of their parallel processing. 
According to the analysis of Ho et al. (2018), there are 7.9 × 107 protein molecules 
per yeast cell. Even if only 1% of protein molecules are functional at a time, there 
would be hundreds of thousand instantiated catalytic processes that are distributed 
in the cytoplasm, membrane, nucleus, and other organelles.
Second, subagents are reusable: they can be recruited by different subsystems 
and/or duplicated and modified for slightly different jobs (Schlosser, 2004: 
540–541). For example, DNA topoisomerase I and II are encoded by different genes 
which originated from some common ancestral gene. At some point of evolution 
their functions diverged: topoisomerase I became specialized in the unwinding of 
the DNA helix for both transcription and replication via the breaking of one of the 
10  Composite Agency

297
stands,1 whereas topoisomerase II resolves DNA knots via the breaking of both 
strands (Lodish et al., 2000). Gene regulatory modules also become reused to simi-
lar functions. For example, gene modules that regulate limb patterning and growth 
are reused for each limb with slight modifications.
The third advantage is that biological modularity facilitates robustness (Schlosser, 
2004: 520), which entails protection of the functionality of subagents from distur-
bances both internal and external. Examples of internal disturbances are mutations, 
the activity of transposons, errors in transcription and translation, misfolding of 
proteins, and abnormal regulation of metabolism or gene expression. External dis-
turbances can be caused by changes in neighbor subagents, a deficiency of resources, 
or physical damage. These problems can be compensated for or repaired locally in 
the affected subagents. If despite of these protective responses a cell fails to operate 
normally, it enters a self-destruction pathway (apoptosis), or it may become con-
sumed by immune cells (e.g., macrophages). As a result, organisms can tolerate 
substantial damages and deregulation, and still remain alive and functional. In this 
respect, living systems are more robust than technical agents.
Finally, the fourth benefit of modularity is adaptability (plasticity) at physiologi-
cal, developmental, and evolutionary time scales. Each subagent is a source of 
potential adaptations. Some adaptive functions are ready to be used on demand – 
such as stress responses; others may require epigenetic or behavioral adjustment 
and tuning. Because of the robust and easy to use interface, unexpected interactions 
between subagents generally do not cause mutual damage but tend to be interpreted 
meaningfully and functionally. Because of their relative autonomy, subagents can 
adapt during development and even evolve in a sequence of generations without 
disrupting the functions of other subagents in the organism. As a result, modular 
organization provides conditions for combinatorial use of the adaptive responses of 
multiple modules (Wagner, 1996: 541).
Because developmental and evolutionary adaptations occur at different time 
scales and are controlled by different mechanisms, Schlosser (2004: 542–543) has 
proposed to distinguish between modules of development and modules of evolution. 
Many developmental modules are evolutionary conserved, which indicates that they 
also function as modules of evolution. According to Schlosser (ibid.), because of the 
interdependency of components within a developmental module, these components 
experience “internal selection”, where the fitness contribution of a component 
depends on other components of the module rather than on the external environ-
ment. This idea can be traced back to Ivan Schmalhausen (1949), who proposed a 
similar concept of “stabilizing selection”, which is driven by internal relations 
between regulatory components and makes embryo development stable in evolution.
According to Schlosser (2004), modules of development may also function as 
modules of evolution if two conditions are met. The first condition is reciprocal 
autonomy, which implies that a given module is not sensitive to the changes of other 
1 Strand is a single chain of nucleotides in DNA, whereas the DNA helix (in a chromosome) is 
formed by two reverse-complementary strands of DNA bound to each other like two sides of 
a ladder.
10.3  Benefits of Modularity

298
modules, and furthermore that other modules are not sensitive to the changes of the 
given module. The second condition is that “the effects of heritable variations rela-
tively faithfully mimic the effects of perturbations during development such as envi-
ronmental fluctuations or somatic mutations” (ibid: 546). The latter condition can 
be violated if heritable variations have pleiotropic effects in multiple modules that 
are differently regulated by developmental mechanisms.
10.4  Semiogenesis in Composite Agents
In Chap. 8 we showed that semiogenesis, which is the emergence of new or modi-
fied sign relations in agents, depends on the plasticity and adaptability of compo-
nent subagents. Here we discuss advanced levels of semiogenesis that require 
continuous long-term interaction and communication between subagents, specifi-
cally guiding interactions and the emergence of super-agents.
10.4.1  Guiding Semiogenesis
The interactions of subagents in organisms often allow them to have a considerable 
freedom in their behavior. In particular, in guiding semiogenesis, a subagent appears 
to constrain the range of either learning or evolution in a partner subagent without 
diminishing its capacity to learn and/or evolve (Sharov, 2017).
The phenomenon of guiding semiogenesis can be found at all levels of organism 
complexity. For example, viruses often integrate into the genome of bacteria and use 
a toxin-antidote system to prevent their bacterial hosts from developing antiviral 
defense mechanisms (Villarreal, 2009). Both the toxin and antidote are encoded by 
genes in the viral genome. After infection, the virus can integrate into the bacterial 
genome, and both the toxin and antidote genes become transcribed. Then, toxin and 
antidote proteins are synthesized on bacterial ribosomes, but the toxin is inactivated 
by an antidote and therefore does not harm the bacterial cell (Fig. 10.3b). If a bacte-
rial cell manages to remove or inactivate the virus, then both the toxin and the anti-
dote will stop being synthesized. Then the unstable antidote protein quickly 
disappears, but the stable toxin persists and kills the bacterial cell (Fig. 10.3d, e). By 
analogy, it can be said that infected bacteria become addicted to the presence of 
viruses and experience a “withdrawal syndrome” after getting rid of the virus 
(Villarreal, 2009: 37). This addiction-like mechanism blocks an evolutionary path-
way in bacterial cells by not allowing them to develop anti-viral defense mechanisms.
Another example of subagents’ guiding semiogenesis takes place in animals 
capable of psychomotor learning. In philosophy, human beings have traditionally 
been seen as a unity of body and mind. However, the interactions between body and 
mind are largely ignored in science. The development and activity of the body is 
studied by embryology and physiology, whereas the dynamics of mind is a subject 
10  Composite Agency

of cognitive science. Unfortunately, these two approaches are mostly conducted 
independently of each other. Biosemiotics, with its emphasis on studying agency, 
and specifically composite agency, offers a new way of bridging this gap by consid-
ering body and mind as two subagents that are connected via reciprocal guiding 
semiogenesis. Here we discuss how internal senses, such as pain, serve as a guiding 
scaffold for the developing mind, and how mental functions affect the development 
and evolution of the body.
We have all had the not-so-pleasant experience of pain. Given its negative, 
unpleasant significance, a natural question is: why do we experience it? Why has the 
pain system emerged and persisted in evolution? Apparently, life would be much 
more comfortable without pain, and doctors and pharmaceutical companies work 
hard to disrupt and compensate for it. Pain receptors emerged very early in the evo-
lution of animals, and exist in all vertebrates and some invertebrates. Their initial 
function might have been to protect the body from damage via fully automated 
innate reflexes. Some of these are still in operation. For example, after touching a 
hot object, we feel pain and unconsciously pull away our hand thanks to a reflex 
arch that is executed by spinal cord neurons (see Fig. 4.6). The sequence of neuron 
excitations is sufficient to support a reflex. However, the reflex of pulling away a 
hand after feeling pain does not explain why pain should be felt as an unpleasant 
experience. It appears that the feeling of pain has an important role in evolution 
because it provides negative reinforcement for associative learning. In particular, 
pain motivates animals to perform activities to reduce actual or potential damage to 
their body (Bonavita & De Simone, 2011). In light of this, it is reasonable to expect 
that animals that are not capable of associative learning (e.g., Cnidarians) do not 
feel pain.

tion of toxin and antidote stops, the antidote degrades fast, and a more stable toxin remains in the

Pain appears to function as an interface between the body and mind which facili-
tates animal learning  – and this is where the guiding interactions take place. 
Examples of pain-mediated learning include avoiding to fall or be hit by something, 
and other painful experiences such as self-biting. Once experienced, pain is easily 
associated with related signals, such as a hot stove or rapidly moving objects. 
Making such associations turns into conditioned behaviors aimed at avoiding pain.
The pain sensorial system also serves to carry information about the location of 
the part of the body that is hurt. Thus, in addition to associating pain with general 
discomfort, we perceive pain as a well-localized disturbance. Information about the 
source of pain helps us to develop more precise behaviors for avoiding pain and 
damage. If we accidentally touch a hot surface, we move away our hand rather than 
our foot. This kind of response is facilitated by the structure of the nervous system 
and brain, involving what is known as sensory-motor coupling. Parts of the human 
body are mapped onto the brain cortex along the central groove (Fig. 10.4), where 
motor cortex areas are located near sensorial cortex areas for the same body part 
(Schott, 1993). Information on the source of pain is also utilized for attracting 
organism’s attention to wounds and other injuries. Animals use wound licking as a 
sort of antibacterial first aid, since saliva contains enzymes, lysozyme, peroxidase, 
defensins, and antibodies, which all have bactericide properties. Some components 
of the saliva (thrombospondin) further have antiviral capacities.
Sensorimotor coupling in the brain plays a scaffolding role for psychomotor 
learning. For example, the synchronous bending of all fingers of the hand is a domi-
nant pattern of motion that is supported by direct neuron connections, whereas 
bending of individual fingers is a harder problem which requires more specialized 
neural activity (Schieber, 1990). According to Schieber, the ability to bend all fin-
gers simultaneously has been of primary importance for our primate ancestors, 
since it is required for grabbing branches or fruits. At the same time, this evolution-
ary scaffolding makes it harder for humans to learn e.g. playing the piano or a violin.

Many animals reuse the pain system for other functions such as interacting with 
relatives and other members of a colony. For example, fighting and punishment are 
used to support the dominance relations between animals and to protect resources 
(food, mating partners). Playful biting is a common element of interaction between 
mammals, where it may indicate a warning or affection. There are furthermore even 
more complex cognitive effects that rely on pain, such as socially complex organ-
isms’ capacities for “feeling” the pain of others in empathy or in grief.
The sense of pain is just one of the scaffolds that are provided by the body to 
facilitate animal learning. Other important sensorial scaffolds include propriocep-
tion and mood chemicals. Proprioception yields information on the state of muscle 
contraction and the relative position of body parts. Some of these signals come from 
intrafusal fibers in muscles that are connected with the endings of sensory neurons. 
Proprioception signaling plays an important role in learning useful movements. 
Mood chemicals include neurotransmitters and hormones that affect animal emo-
tions, such as dopamine, serotonin, and sex hormones. Dopamine signaling func-
tions as a positive reinforcement for various behaviors.
Considering the important role of body scaffolds in learning, it is necessary to 
reevaluate the notion of the heritability of learned habits. The common view in 
behavioral sciences is that only innate behaviors/reflexes are heritable, whereas 
learned behaviors are not heritable. This distinction between innate and learned 
behaviors is fundamental in that innate behaviors are executed from the first attempt 
and do not change, whereas learning requires relatively long periods of trials and 
errors. Learned behaviors often improve with experience. But this difference should 
not be equated with a dichotomy between heritable versus non-heritable behaviors. 
Because learning is guided by a set of bodily scaffolds, which are largely heritable 
traits, the resulting learned habits also appear to be heritable (at least partially). If 
learned behaviors were not heritable, it would be difficult to explain how they can 
be nearly identical in most animals within a population, and why these behaviors 
must have persisted in several lineages over millions of years.
In neo-Darwinism theory, heritability is equivalent to determinism, as if a 
genome determines the phenotype. It was therefore a revolutionary turn in biologi-
cal thinking when Waddington proposed a new model of heritability according to 
which genes do not determine the phenotype but instead regulate embryo develop-
ment in a context of changing internal and external conditions (Waddington, 1968). 
This model became a cornerstone of the evo-devo concept, and led to the develop-
ment of the extended evolutionary synthesis (Pigliucci & Müller, 2010). The model 
of an epigenetic landscape can be further expanded to learning traits and learning 
trajectories. It is natural to expect that learning trajectories can converge due to 
common sensorial information, effector organs, sensory-motor coupling, and other 
networks and scaffolds, which together can be seen as behavioral analogs of the 
epigenetic landscape. One example of such an approach is analysis of the epigenetic 
landscape of alcoholism (Krishnan et al., 2014).
Convergence of behavioral trajectories does not contradict the fact that many 
learned behaviors vary among individuals. These variations can be caused by differ-
ences in body scaffolds, development history, social rank, personality, the

environment, individual experiences, or other contextual factors. Variability in 
behaviors may also result from the presence of multiple equally adaptive distinct 
patterns of actions. For example, predators may benefit either from catching their 
prey on the run, or from hiding and waiting for approaching prey. These two strate-
gies may be equally successful, but they require entirely different behaviors. The 
multiplicity of adaptive strategies can presumably support rapid changes in behav-
iors within the life span of an individual. It may also result in mixed strategies where 
both behaviors are used, depending on the situation.
Now let us consider some reciprocal effects of mind-driven behaviors on the 
development and evolution of the body. Lamarck was apparently the first to notice 
the effect of behavioral change on the strengthening of corresponding organs via 
exercise. Many animal species exhibit substantial physiological and even morpho-
logical plasticity in response to behavioral change. The mechanisms of these effects 
are not fully clear, but it is conceivable that the body adapts to new mind-driven 
behaviors such as in cases of phenotypic accommodation (West-Eberhard, 2003). 
Another reciprocal effect of mind and behavior on the body is associated with the 
Baldwin effect,2 where behavioral changes affect the direction of natural selection 
in various organs (Baldwin, 1896).
10.4.2  The Emergence of Composite Agents
The integration of agents into a composite agency in the course of evolution was 
first analyzed by Valentin Turchin (1977), who characterized it as involving a meta-
system transition (see also Chap. 4). This phenomenon has been repeatedly re-­
discovered and presented under different names and within different contexts, 
including major evolutionary transitions (Maynard Smith & Szathmáry, 1995; 
Szathmáry & Maynard Smith, 1995; Ginsburg & Jablonka, 2019), the evolutionary 
increase of semiotic freedom in organisms (Hoffmeyer & Stjernfelt, 2016), and 
hierarchogenesis (Mikhailovsky, 2018a, b). In this subsection we analyze semiotic 
aspects of this process, with particular emphasis on how sign relations are rear-
ranged and expanded when previously independent agents become integrated into a 
super-agency.
Seven major events of integration of simpler agents into progressively more 
complex composite agents are summarized in Fig. 10.5: (1) functional coenzyme-­
like molecules at the origin of life were integrated into autocatalytic polymers, (2) 
the emergence of RNA-world cells, (3) the emergence of prokaryotic cells, (4) the 
emergence of eukaryotic cells, (5) the emergence of multicellular organisms, (6) 
integration of single-cell and multicellular organisms into social and symbiotic sys-
tems, and (7) the emergence of civilization, with its ecological consequences. We do 
not have direct evidence related to the initial two events, and their status therefore

remains hypothetical.3 All these transitions took place over a long time period; how-
ever, after being established, some of the transitions are now repeated in every gen-
eration in an accelerated fashion. For example, each multicellular organism develops 
from a single eukaryotic cell, and then builds its symbiotic and social relations with 
other organisms before realizing the full scope of its species-specific activities.
Events of integration may also happen at the level of subagents (Turchin, 1977). 
For example, neurons are integrated into complex networks, and a number of pho-
toreceptors are integrated into an image-capturing retina. After this integration, a set 
of subagents can execute new emergent functions that would not be possible for any 
of the subagents in isolation.
Turchin (1977) described one of the pathways towards the emergence of com-
posite agents as follows (Fig. 10.6a). First, nearly identical lower-level agents (e.g.,

progeny cells originated from a single ancestral cell) become integrated into a single 
unit. Second, they become specialized via division of labor. Finally, the third step is 
the establishment of new higher-level controlling networks that integrate and coor-
dinate the functions of the emerging composite agent. The latter step is often associ-
ated with the loss of the capacity for self-reproduction for certain subagents. 
Because this pathway starts with a homogenous set of lower-level agents we call it 
integration of homogenous components.
Turchin, however, did not foresee that composite agency can also become estab-
lished via symbiosis of entirely distinct kinds of previously free-living agents 
(Fig. 10.6b). At the first step in this pathway (step I), lower-level agents of various 
kinds start living jointly, and establish mutually beneficial (i.e., symbiotic) relations. 
Second, interacting agents are subjected to co-adaptation and specialization (step 
II). The last step (III) is the establishment of new, higher-level controlling networks. 
The regulation may include the digestion or destruction of subagents for regulatory 
purposes (e.g., a partial destruction of gut microbiota in animals) or control of their 
reproduction (e.g., of mitochondria in eukaryotic cells). Because this evolutionary 
pathway relies on the symbiosis of lower-level agents, it is called symbiogenesis.
The importance of symbiogenesis in evolution has been advocated by Lynn 
Margulis (1998), who collected extensive evidence proving that eukaryotic cells 
originated via symbiosis of unrelated species of prokaryotes. In particular, mito-
chondria and plastids have been shown to be descendants of free-living bacteria. 
Another example of symbiogenesis concerns the origin of lichen via the symbiosis 
of fungus, aglae, and bacteria (Honegger, 2012). Symbiosis often originates from

commensalism or parasitism; both of these relationships require close contacts 
between organisms of different species, which is a precondition for development of 
mutually beneficial interactions. An example of benefits in symbiosis is that latent 
viral infection often protects the host from other infections (Barton et al., 2007; 
Lederberg, 1951).
Many symbionts are transmitted vertically to the offspring of host organisms via 
various mechanisms, e.g. intra-genomically (latent viruses), intra-cellularly (mito-
chondria, plastids, rickettsia), via contamination of egg shells (insect gut microbi-
ota) or shared habitat (e.g. fungi spores carried by bark beetles). If symbionts are not 
transmitted vertically, they can be recruited from the environment. For example, 
lichen-forming fungus recruits algae, and micorrhyzae-forming plants or orchids 
recruit fungus (Honegger, 2012). After the recruitment, the culturing of externally 
acquired subagents is functionally equivalent to the use of animals and plants in 
human agriculture. Symbiogenesis is now widely accepted in biology as a possible 
evolutionary path towards systems of high complexity (Seckbach, 2006).
No matter how it is formed, a living composite agent represents a self-­reproducing 
superorganism. The metasystem transition therefore results in the appearance of a 
new, larger unit of natural selection. Composite agents have heritable phenotypes, 
and their heredity is supported by the genomes and epigenetic factors of their com-
ponents, as well as by heritable interactions between components. Combined with 
natural selection, heritable variation can result in the development of superagent-­
level adaptations such as improved lateral, top-down, and bottom-up interaction 
between subagents. For example, the integration of composite agents can start with 
lateral interactions such as mutual scaffolding and sharing of resources. The first 
multicellular organisms may have shared their extracellular matrix, mineral depos-
its, and nutrients. However, to preserve the composition of subagents in the long 
term, composite agents also need top-down interactions, and the emergence of these 
may require natural selection at the superagent level.
Organisms mostly rely on the self-reproduction of subagents to replenish their 
numbers. The loss of all subagents of a certain kind may thus appear to be irrevers-
ible, except for those organisms that can replace missing subagents via synthesis, 
construction, remodeling, or recruitment from the environment. The loss of sub-
agents may be lethal for the super-agent if the subagents are irreplaceable and their 
functions cannot be compensated for by other subagents. This kind of effect on the 
mortality of super-agents facilitates natural selection that favors development of 
regulatory mechanisms to maintain a safe minimum number of any irreplaceable 
types of subagents. For example, cells cannot survive if they lose all their mitochon-
dria or all copies of some important metabolism-related gene (e.g., RNA poly-
merase-­II). Therefore, eukaryotic cells have developed a complex cell division 
process, called mitosis, which ensures that the most important subagents (e.g., chro-
mosomes, centrioles) are distributed in equal numbers between daughter cells.
Multicellular organisms use cell reprogramming to compensate for the loss of 
some kinds of cell types. Most organs/tissues carry undifferentiated stem cells that 
are capable of replenishing specialized cell types. However, the reprogramming 
capacities of these cells are limited. For instance, neural stem cells can differentiate 
10.4  Semiogenesis in Composite Agents

only into neurons but not into muscle or skin cells. Similarly, myocytes can differ-
entiate only into muscle cells and not into neurons.
The benefits of these top-down interactions can be offset by the selfish bottom-up 
strategies of individual subagents, if they exploit the system by excessive self-­
reproduction and by exhausting communal resources, stopping their expected pro-
duction services, or leaving the system. Examples of such selfish activities are well 
known at various levels of biological organization. The self-production of misfolded 
prion proteins results in various kinds of neural degeneration in animals. The uncon-
trolled self-reproduction of cells causes cancer. Cancer cells often exploit host 
resources by stimulating the growth of blood vessels into a tumor, or they avoid 
detection by the immune system (Vinay et al., 2015). Similarly, replication of trans-
posable genetic elements (mostly of viral origin) populates the genome with non-
functional junk DNA and often damages the function of genes.
Leaving a higher-level agent is a real possibility for many subagents. For exam-
ple, cancer cells can turn into evolutionary independent parasitic species if they 
become transmitted between animals (Murchison et al., 2014). There is also evi-
dence that some symbionts are able to switch to alternative host species, showing a 
certain plasticity in their evolutionary paths (Bright & Bulgheresi, 2010). Such 
internal conflicts are inevitable in composite agents because they stem from the 
semiotic freedom of subagents, and freedom cannot be fully suppressed without a 
loss of the evolutionary advantages that are associated with the composite nature of 
agents. In this way, composite agents maintain a balance between the interests of 
partially cooperating and partially conflicting subagents.
If selfish behaviors become frequent, they trigger the emergence of tighter con-
trol mechanisms that restrict or even disrupt the self-reproduction of certain sub-
agents. The emergence of such top-down regulations requires natural selection at 
the superagent level. Full disruption of reproduction can be applied only to replace-
able subagents (e.g., to differentiated cells in multicellular organisms); otherwise 
the whole system may stop growing or die. Examples of self-reproducing and non-­
replaceable subagents inside cells include genes, mitochondria, plastids, the plasma 
membrane, and centrioles. However, the reproduction of all these components is 
under strict top-down control. For example, mitochondria and plastids, which origi-
nated from ancient free-living bacteria, have lost the majority of their genes which 
were translocated to the main genome in the nucleus of the eukaryotic cell. Thus, 
neither mitochondria nor plastids can live independently outside of host cells.
Multicellular organisms have developed complex mechanisms to restrict any 
unlimited reproduction of somatic cells. In particular, telomere length progressively 
decreases with each cell cycle of somatic cells, and this eventually stops cell divi-
sion (Lodish et al., 2000). Only germ cells are allowed to reproduce indefinitely. 
Mammalian germ cells protect their status via the simultaneous expression of mul-
tiple synergistically acting genes that support the expression of each other (Chen 
et al., 2008). Accidental activation of any single gene from this set of germ-line 
specific genes has no consequences, because any of these genes cannot function 
alone. However, cancer cells can overcome this security protection by shutting 
down certain repressive components of the gene regulatory network (e.g., p53

signaling). Since the integrity of the whole system can be threatened by the uncon-
trolled reproduction of pathogens, symbionts, or cancer cells, organisms require 
advanced protective subagents that are collectively known as the immune system.
In multi-organism agents such as colonies of social insects, the reproduction 
capacity of individual organisms is controlled by complex social interactions. The 
majority of bees, ants, and termites do not reproduce. Only the queen and a small 
number of males are allowed to reproduce; these behaviors are supported by physi-
ological design and controlled by chemical and behavioral communication between 
individuals. Group-living mammals (e.g., certain species of rodents, ungulates, and 
primates) have also developed complex behavioral control of the reproduction in 
each group.
Jay Lemke (2000) explored the semiotic consequences of metasystem transi-
tions. He noted that the emergence of a new hierarchical level of biological organi-
zation is often associated with integration of lower-level information sources (e.g., 
signals) into higher level interpretations, which may in turn function as higher-level 
signals. Lemke formulated the “principle of alternation”, where quantitative topo-
logical changes are converted to qualitative typological signals or, vise versa, typo-
logical signals modify the quantitative topological features of higher-level 
components. For example, the quantity of a chemical (e.g., a neuro-transmitter) may 
be converted into the discrete neuronal firing.
The problem of emergence in composite agents has been explored mathemati-
cally by Nils Baas (2006). He introduced the notion of a hyperstructure, which is a 
set of lower-level agents that employ observational mechanisms, where obtained 
observations regulate the set of interactions between agents. The interaction of 
lower-level agents results in the emergence of higher-level agents, which in turn can 
be integrated into the next level of composite agents. Some events of emergence can 
be deduced (or computed), whereas others are observed but appear not deductible.4 
The formation of higher-level agents can be associated with the appearance of new 
observers and new observation mechanisms and frames, which in our terms repre-
sent semiogenesis.
10.5  Mixed Identity
Having a multi-level organization brings enormous advantages to evolving living 
beings. In particular, it supports the division of labor between subagents and ensures 
plasticity, robustness, and the evolvability of sign regulatory networks. But multi-­
levelness also brings with it the problem of coordination between partially autono-
mous subagents. Many subagents have enough autonomy for independent learning 
4 For instance, Gödel sentences in a formal system are observed as true but cannot be deduced from 
axioms (Baas & Emmeche, 1997).
10.5  Mixed Identity

308
and evolution, and thus the phenotype of an organism often combines a mosaic of 
features developed by its subagents.
Organisms carry with them a multitude of various parasites and symbionts, such 
as transposable elements and viruses integrated into the genome, intracellular para-
sitic bacteria (e.g., Wolbachia), protozoan latent infection (e.g., Toxoplasma), and 
gut microbiota. Moreover, the physiology of the human mind indicates that there is 
no central decision-making element in the brain; instead there is a “society of mind” 
composed of many subagents (e.g., neurons and groups of interconnected neurons) 
which usually come to “agreement” via a sort of negotiation (Minsky, 1986). Similar 
ideas were developed by Lorenz, who referred to “the great parliament of instincts” 
where instincts compete and compromise on their values. He wrote that “its true 
democratic nature has developed through a probationary period in evolution, and it 
produces, if not always complete harmony, at least tolerable and practicable com-
promises between different interests” (Lorenz, 2002 [1963]: 83). The phenotype 
and behavior of organisms is, in our perspective, a product of a multitude of interac-
tions between subagents that are integrated by a semiotic network.
The partial independence of multiple coexisting subagents often leads to internal 
conflicts, especially if subagents belong to different species. Some parasites and 
symbionts change the phenotype or behavior of the host organism for their own 
benefit, as we discussed in subsection 10.2. Viruses recruit host ribosomes to pro-
duce viral proteins and eventually kill the cell in a lytic cycle (Fig. 10.7a). However, 
many viruses do not kill their host organism, but instead become integrated into its 
genome and then reproduce together with the host in a lysogenic cycle (Vander Elst 
& Meyer, 2018). In this case, a parasite and its host become integrated into a system 
with mixed identity, where subagents do not attempt to get full control over 
each other.
Multi-agent semiotic networks are burdened with an intrinsic uncertainty associ-
ated with their development and evolution. This can be compared to quantum uncer-
tainty. A bacterium with a latent virus infection has three potential long-term 
outcomes (Fig. 10.7b): (i) it can recover by killing or inactivating the virus, (ii) it 
may die, releasing viral particles, and (iii) bacteria and virus may continue coexist-
ing. In the latter case, the virus can bring certain advantages to the bacterium, such 
as immunity against other viruses (Villarreal, 2009).
Mixed identity is a common phenomenon in all organisms. Due to horizontal 
gene transfer and sexual reproduction, individual genes often have their own phylo-
genetic trees, which only approximately match the phylogeny of whole organisms 
(Puigbo et al., 2013). Reconstructed evolutionary trees therefore do not perfectly 
match each other, as shown in the example of a fragment of prokaryote tree 
(Fig. 10.8). The implication is that we cannot be 100% sure whether or not an organ-
ism belongs to a certain species, instead there is a probability distribution. Maureen 
O’Malley and Eugene Koonin (2011) refers to this phenomenon as a “statistical tree 
of life”.
Horizontal gene transfer is most common in prokaryotes, but also happens in 
eukaryotes, where it is usually mediated by viral infections or symbiosis. Although 
the majority of horizontal gene transfers are either lethal or non-functional, in rare 
10  Composite Agency

309
cases they result in a rapid change in the phenotype of recipient species (Koonin & 
Galperin, 2003). For example, the capacity for photosynthesis appeared in individ-
ual species within unrelated lineages of bacteria, and it is supported by similar 
genes, indicating multiple events of horizontal gene transfer in the past (Villarreal, 
2009: 131). In eukaryotes, gene mixing occurs mostly by sexual reproduction. 
Despite of interbreeding barriers between species, there are always some chances 
for hybridization, and some hybrids turn out to be fertile.
The development of agent identity is a dynamic and non-deterministic process, 
which is similar to individuation as treated by Gilbert Simondon (Scott, 2014). 
Mixed identity appears typical for many organisms because they may follow alter-
native potential pathways in their development, learning, and interaction with their 
symbionts and parasites. In this way, mixed identity contributes to semiotic

Chapter 11
Human Agency and Ecology
Abstract  A precondition for understanding current ecology is to understand how 
human agency influences ecology. In this chapter we describe the world-changing 
effects of human agency. A key notion in this context is the ‘Anthropocene’, the 
geological epoch in which human agency predominates as a causal factor. Drawing 
on Umwelt theory, we explain how human agency can work as a driver of environ-
mental change. Special attention is given to the ecological function of human–ani-
mal assemblages and other human–animal complexes, since it is primarily by way 
of utilization of animals that humans have a dominant impact on ecosystems. The 
descriptive part of the chapter is followed by a normative part focused on how envi-
ronmental sustainability can be achieved and how animal welfare can be improved. 
In our view, achieving environmental sustainability requires societal transforma-
tions that can be modelled using Umwelt theory. The semiotic agency of human 
beings must in this context be approached from different angles simultaneously and 
take both semiotic and efficient causation into account. An implication of our per-
spective is that socio-ecological transformations must align with coordinated socio-­
cultural transformations. For instance, human values and identity (features of the 
human Innenwelt) must change for human perception and practices (features of the 
human Umwelt) to change. With regard to animal welfare, we discuss both farm and 
wildlife settings, and emphasize the importance of facilitating the animals’ auton-
omy and needs-fulfilment.
11.1  The World-Changing Effects of Human Agency: 
The Emergence of the Anthropocene
Over the last generation, there has been growing acknowledgement of the under-
standing that human beings are changing the global ecology of our planet. Today, 
the notion of the ‘Anthropocene’ is often used to promote or problematize the view 
that we live on a human-dominated planet. In its current meaning, this term was first 
introduced in year 2000 (Crutzen & Steffen, 2003), and has since gained traction in 
the environmental discourse. As the name suggests, the Anthropocene is the era of 

314
the human species. From our perspective in this book, the Anthropocene idea is a 
vivid expression of the world-changing effects of human agency. In physical format, 
this can be observed e.g. in terms of how land mass is rearranged for human pur-
poses. Zalasiewicz et al. (2016) give an overview of the scale and diversity of what 
they call ‘the physical technosphere’, understood as the material output or traces of 
human activities on planet Earth.1 They estimate that the current mass of the tech-
nosphere is approximately 30 trillion tones (Tt)”, including structures that are in 
active use as well as material residue such as the nearly 1 Tt of CO2 we have left 
behind in the aerial technosphere (the authors also refer to an urban, a rural, a sub-
terranean, and a marine technosphere).
The context in which the Anthropocene notion was launched is that of geological 
time scales. The Anthropocene is a suggestion for a new label for our current geo-
logical epoch, which has previously been called the ‘Holocene’ and defined as the 
time since the last ice age. If one accepts the introduction of the Anthropocene 
notion as a geological designation, an important question is: When did the Holocene 
end, and the Anthropocene start? Prominent Anthropocene scholars have suggested 
that the Anthropocene started around the time of the industrial revolution, when the 
global human economy was picking up steam and several kinds of resource use 
started skyrocketing (Steffen et al., 2011). Alternative proposals refer to the first 
noticeable climatic changes caused by human beings, which were related to early 
agriculture and forestry practices several thousand years ago (Ruddiman, 2003), or 
more recent events such as the first test of a nuclear bomb, which left atmospheric 
traces all over the world (Zalasiewicz et al., 2015; for a discussion of different sug-
gestions, see Crutzen & Steffen, 2003).
This chapter covers human impact on ecology in both wildlife settings and other 
settings, including indoor, more or less industrialized environments related to ani-
mal husbandry. The latter are in some cases highly controlled environments and 
may in extreme cases resemble a laboratory environment more than they resemble 
outdoor environments. However, outdoor environments are also to varying degrees 
influenced and shaped by human agency. Given a scale of varying degrees of human 
control and impact, the most controlled indoor environments in which animals are 
kept represent one extreme, with wilderness areas with little human impact repre-
senting the extreme in the other end. Since animals as well as human beings are 
ecological creatures that are always embedded in an ecology of some sort, we 
should not believe that conditions stop being “ecological” just because we keep 
animals indoors. The tangible characteristics of these specific ecologies is what is of 
interest in the context of an outline of human ecology (for a contemporary outline 
based on a multi-scale ecosemiotic approach, see Tønnessen, 2020a). The high pro-
portion of mammals (measured by biomass, cf. Bar-On et al., 2018) that currently 
live in industrial indoor environments, utilizing intensive animal husbandry 
1 The Earth’s crust is made of 81 stable (i.e. non-radioactive) elements. Absolutely all of these are 
mined and utilized by human beings (Bonnet & Woltjer, 2008: 242).

technology and practices, is telling of the high degree of ecological impact human 
beings have in our age.
From one perspective, the human ecological dominance that we can witness 
today is simply a consequence of the global dominance of one species. Humans and 
animals alike tend to be more concerned with their conspecifics than with individu-
als of other species. This amounts to speciesism (i.e., favoring individuals of one’s 
own species over others with no other justification than reference to species mem-
bership – see e.g. Singer, 1975). Speciesism is ethically unjustified by definition, 
and a sign of human bias in our moral judgements. As such it is lamentable. Animal 
protectionists often accuse a majority of human beings of being guilty of specie-
sism, but it is not clear whether human beings apply speciesism to a larger extent 
than other species do. In light of many animals’ inclination to favour their own kind, 
it is not surprising that a species that achieves global dominance will use this posi-
tion to its own advantage, whether this happens deliberately or habitually. On the 
other hand, one might perhaps claim that given our high degree of self-reflectivity 
humans should be able to claim the moral high ground and avoid speciesism 
altogether.
The influence of human agency has increased exponentially as the human popu-
lation has increased and various factors have contributed to more potent agency. 
These include longer lives and better health, the extension of education from the 
selected few to almost everybody, scientific progress, and more advanced applica-
tion of technical knowledge. In the context of the environmental impact of human-
ity, it is also significant that a number of countries recently have or soon will go 
through the so-called ‘demographic transition’, transitioning from a situation with 
high mortality and high birth rates to a situation with low mortality and low birth 
rates (Lee, 2003). The larger share of young people this results in mid-way in the 
transition is correlated with higher economic growth rates, partly because a larger 
share of people is active in work life. In a later stage, with a higher share of elderly 
people, there are more mouths to feed due to the lower mortality combined with 
longer life expectancy. In many cases, what is a good development in terms of 
human development and quality of life may have detrimental effects on the 
environment.
Overall, several observations indicate that human agency taken as a whole has 
become more potent over time. These include e.g. the consistently increasing cli-
mate gas emissions globally (IPCC, 2014, cf. also IPCC, 2018), the accelerating 
decline in biodiversity (Ceballos et  al., 2015; IPBES, 2019; WWF, 2018) and 
increasing human dominance (Bar-On et al., 2018) of biological diversity, and deto-
riating developments in various Earth systems (Rockström et  al., 2009; Steffen 
et al., 2011). However, it is also important to be aware of the fact that the environ-
mental impact per person is by some measures (e.g., in terms of land use) lower 
today than in previous times. Furthermore, the carbon intensity of the global econ-
omy has generally been declining for several decades. This means that the increase 
in climate gas emissions globally is not the result of a more carbon intensive econ-
omy; instead, it is the outcome of an economy that has grown faster than the carbon 
intensity has declined. This is some of the background for contemporary 
11.1  The World-Changing Effects of Human Agency: The Emergence…

316
discussions about economic growth, where some (e.g. Asafu-Adjaye et al., 2015) 
believe that “greener” growth is the answer to the ecological crisis, whereas others 
(e.g. Næss, 1989) hold that economic growth is part of the problem and that the 
economy must transition to a system that does not rely on growth.
From a systems perspective, we can consider the human population, the human 
economy, and the natural environment as three dynamic systems that are coupled 
and interrelated. The development of the ecological crisis can in this light be 
explained by human population dynamics combined with the (interrelated) dynam-
ics of the human economy, with both of these human systems also adapting continu-
ally in response to changes in the natural environment (e.g. concerning the 
availability of resources). Such dynamics were famously explored in The Limits to 
Growth (Meadows et al., 1974), which focused both on historical developments and 
scenarios for the future. Below in this chapter, we present a three-dimensional inter-
active semiotic model of environmental change (Sect. 11.2) and of societal transfor-
mations (Sect. 11.6) that builds on a biosemiotic perspective drawn from 
Umwelt theory.
By today, the international society has acknowledged that the current human 
economy is not environmentally sustainable in the long run and that systematic 
changes are required. The term ‘sustainable development’ was launched by the 
World Commission on Environment and Development (WCED, 1987), and has 
more recently been operationalized in terms of a number of environmental, social 
and economic ‘sustainable development goals’ (United Nations, 2015b) which the 
international community aims to achieve by 2030. This implies improving living 
conditions for human beings while simultaneously reducing the environmental 
impact of human activities. According to O’Neill et al. (2018) no country currently 
offers its inhabitants decent living conditions in an environmentally sustainable way.
In the environmental discourse, particular emphasis has for the last 25 years or 
so been put on climate change, with the Paris agreement (United Nations, 2015a) 
marking the international community’s commitment or at least ambition in this con-
text. The role of technology is hotly debated. While technological innovations have 
no doubt contributed decisively to human development and improved living condi-
tions, they have also made environmental degradation of an unprecedented scale 
possible, which ultimately can threaten the continued existence of the human spe-
cies. In the context of climate change, those who have the most belief in technologi-
cal solutions have suggested to use so-called ‘geo-engineering’, defined as “the 
deliberate large-scale manipulation of the planetary environment to counteract 
anthropogenic climate change” (The Royal Society, 2009: 1). We will return to dif-
ferent attitudes to how environmental problems could be solved later on in this 
chapter.
This chapter starts out with a description of the ways in which human agency can 
be a driver of environmental change (Sect. 11.2), before delving into the role of 
human-animal complexes (Sect. 11.3) and the ecological function of human-animal 
assemblages (Sect. 11.4). From a biosemiotic point of view, a central question is 
how a semiotic understanding of the ecological crisis can contribute to finding a 
way forward in terms of what kinds of systemic changes that are required. We return 
11  Human Agency and Ecology

317
to this question in Sect. 11.5, “Sustainability: How to address Environmental 
Problems”, which is followed by a treatment of related issues in animal husbandry 
(Sect. 11.6) and wildlife management (Sect. 11.7). The chapter concludes with an 
outline of the potential for human interaction with animals in mixed communities 
(i.e., human–animal communities).
Another question concerning the relevance of semiotics in the context of the 
ecological crisis is whether there is any resemblance between semiotic and non-­
semiotic global notions, such as the ‘semiosphere’ (Lotman, 2009) and the 
‘Anthropocene’. The two notions are not intended to cover the same phenomena, 
with the former referring to the realm of signs and the latter to a geological epoch in 
the history of life. However, in Jesper Hoffmeyer’s biosemiotically informed con-
ception of the semiosphere (Hoffmeyer, 1996), the semiosphere corresponds to the 
biosphere and thus shares the global environmental aspect with the Anthropocene 
notion. Another reason to think of the semiosphere in this biosemiotic sense as 
related to the Anthropocene is the fact that evidence of human dominance over eco-
systems is traceable in the semiotic properties and dimensions of the biosphere, i.e. 
in the semiosphere.
The notion of the semiosphere is most often used in purely descriptive terms. 
This was the case even for Hoffmeyer’s use of the term. However, it would arguably 
make sense to operate with a normative notion of semiosphere as well. This would 
shed new light on the dynamics and interrelations between cultural and natural sign 
systems, and enable us to distinguish between sustainable or healthy human semio-
sis and unsustainable or unsound human semiosis in an ecological context (cf. also 
Tønnessen, 2021). The normative dimension of the notion of semiosphere would for 
instance be related to issues such as fairness or some form of sustainable balance in 
relations between humans and non-humans (cf. ibid.), or humanity’s fair share of 
land and resources. Developing a normative notion of semiosphere will also allow 
us to integrate descriptive ecosemiotic theory (e.g. Nöth, 2001) with biosemiotic 
ethics (which is briefly treated in Sects. 11.5 and 11.6).
11.2  Human Agency as a Driver of Environmental Change
The ways in which human agency functions as a driver of environmental change can 
be approached from different academic perspectives. Framing anthropogenic envi-
ronmental change in terms of the Anthropocene idea in effect involves combining a 
long-term historical perspective with a geological perspective. This framing suc-
ceeds in highlighting significant planet-scale events and developments. However, in 
and by itself, it only allows for explaining the impact that human agency has on the 
natural world in physio-chemical terms, i.e., in terms of efficient causation. Applying 
a semiotic perspective as a supplement to physio-chemical perspectives allows us to 
explain the impact of human agency in and on the natural world in much more detail.
Figure 11.1 depicts a semiotic model of environmental change which incorpo-
rates the physio-chemical environment by way of Uexküll’s notion of the

‘Umgebung’ (surrounding) of an organism. The Umgebung of an organism can in 
the context of the model be defined as incorporating everything that has an impact 
on the organism in terms of physics or chemistry. In the model, the Umgebung con-
stitutes one of three “dimensions of living nature” (Tønnessen, 2019: 419), along 
with the ‘Innenwelt’ (inner subjective world) and ‘Umwelt’ (outer subjective world) 
of the organism – together, the Umwelt and the Innenwelt form the subjective expe-
riential world of the organism. Framed in this way, all three dimensions of living 
nature are described using notions from von Uexküll’s work (von Uexküll, 1921).2
This model shows how semiotic and physical forces in form of signals and cau-
sation work in tandem, and how semiotic phenomena and processes can have an 
influence on the development of the physical environment, and vice versa. A basic 
assumption of the model is that signals which emerge from each of the dimensions 
of living nature (specifically environmental signals, Umwelt signals, and Innenwelt 
signals) have an impact on the other dimensions. For instance, environmental sig-
nals constitute some of the material, as it were, of an Umwelt. Similarly, Umwelt 
signals constitute some of the material of the Innenwelt, and Innenwelt signals con-
stitute some of the material of the Umwelt.
A key element in this dynamic process is the ‘semiotic causation’ that involves 
“the bringing about of changes [in the Umgebung] under the guidance of 
2 While Jakob von Uexküll did not himself develop any systematic account of human impact on 
ecosystems, his most accessible works (von Uexküll, 1956 [1934/1940], translated to English as 
von Uexküll, 2010 [1934/1940]) make use of a number of examples of human–animal interaction 
and animal behavior in human-dominated environments.

319
interpretation” (Hoffmeyer, 2008: 149) and occurs at the interface of the Umwelt 
and the Umgebung. The better known efficient causation occurs within the dimen-
sion of the Umgebung, i.e. within the physical environment.
As designed in Fig. 11.1, the model is applicable on any organism endowed with 
an Umwelt. By applying the model on the human species, and thus using it to 
describe the development of the human Innenwelt, Umwelt, and Umgebung over 
time, we can get a sense of the ways in which human agency can serve as a driver 
of environmental change globally. In effect, this has happened by circumstances in 
the physical environment (human Umgebung) triggering changes in the human 
Umwelt (human experience of its surroundings) which have in turn triggered 
changes in the human Innenwelt (related e.g. to identity, selfhood and values). The 
changed Innenwelt has again triggered changes in the human Umwelt, which have 
triggered changes in the physical environment (through changed human behaviour 
towards it), and so on, in ever new Innenwelt transitions (Tønnessen, 2019) and 
Umwelt transitions (Tønnessen, 2009). In the long run, these transitions en masse 
constitute Innenwelt trajectories (Tønnessen, 2019) and Umwelt trajectories 
(Tønnessen, 2014).
Since the model presented in Fig. 11.1 is applicable on any organism with an 
Umwelt, it also allows for exploring how animal Umwelten have changed and been 
impacted by human agency over time. Any organism has to adapt to changing envi-
ronments; and most animals in the Anthropocene have to adapt to increasingly 
human-dominated environments. In brief, animals’ Umwelten have in this context 
changed due to the ways their Umgebung have changed as a result of human impact, 
and furthermore as a result of humans’ direct actions towards them, and humans’ 
impact on other animals of significance to them, both of which is ultimately experi-
enced by the animals through their Umwelt, which might in turn affect the develop-
ment of their Innenwelt.
As stressed by the design of the model, while many animals currently strive to 
adapt to anthropogenically induced environmental changes, they do so with their 
semiotic agency intact, as active and not merely passive subjects. Semiotic causa-
tion can be identified not only with regard to human agency, but in principle just as 
much with regard to animal agency, and any living agency for that matter. 
Anthropogenic semiotic causation stands out in recent and contemporary ecological 
developments by its at times overwhelming force and magnitude, but this must not 
lead us to think that we are the only true agents on the planet.
As one of us have stated in earlier work, the ecological crisis can be character-
ized as “an ontological crisis with historical roots in humankind’s domestication of 
animals and plants, which can be taken as archetypical for our attempted planet-­
scale taming of the wild” (Tønnessen, 2010b: 375). The centrality of domestication 
in the history of the human species is also stressed by Diamond (2002: 700), who 
characterizes it as “the most momentous change in Holocene human history”. In the 
terminology of the model of environmental change presented earlier, the emergence 
of domestication marks a key Umwelt transition in the history of the human species, 
with profound effects for the subsequent Umwelt trajectory of mankind, and reper-
cussions for the physical environment of a multitude of species and thus also for

their Umwelten and Innenwelten. This is one of the topics we turn to in the next 
subsection.
11.3  Human-Animal Complexes (Domestication)
A human–animal complex can be defined as any complex of humans and animals 
for which human agency plays a significant role for the coming to be and mainte-
nance of the complex. Thus defined, human–animal complexes play an important 
role in human ecology, directly by way of the human animal–relations that are 
installed or supported in this way, and indirectly by the effects these have on vegeta-
tion, landscapes etc. In the long run of human history, human–animal complexes 
have played an important role at least for 15,000 to 100,000 years or so, when dogs 
emerged from the domestication of wolves. Meanwhile, the significance of human 
ecology for ecology more widely has increased as the human species has increased 
its geographical range to all inhabitable continents and the human population has 
grown from maybe 1 million individuals 300,000  years ago and 4 million 
10,000 years ago to maybe 50 million individuals 3000 years ago (Kremer, 1993), 
and so on.
As Horard-Herbin et al. (2014) remark, “[t]he dog was the first animal to be 
domesticated by the Upper Paleolithic hunter-gatherers, but their domestication 
process remains difficult to understand, in terms of chronology, geographic origin, 
and recurrence of the phenomenon.” Current genetic and archeological evidence 
does not make for a coherent picture. Ancient literal sources indicate that dogs were 
tracking partners helping in hunting (ibid: 27), and it is likely that this has also been 
an important part of the background for the very first domestication of the wolf. 
Forming inter-species hunting teams would have been mutually beneficial in terms 
of feeding strategies and outcome. At this stage, human beings and wolves also had 
several behavioral traits in common, with specimen of both species living in mostly 
family-based groups of social hunters (Hall & Sharp, 1978).
The ecological importance of human–animal complexes has increased over time, 
as the nature of human–animal complexes has evolved, and new complexes have 
been formed. A major event was the agricultural revolution, which marked a transi-
tion from a nomadic or semi-nomadic hunter-gatherer lifestyle occasionally aided 
by dogs to more sedentary lifestyles in permanent settlements organized around 
farming and animal husbandry. When humans started keeping animals for food, it 
meant that the competition for prey changed character, as humans now had to pro-
tect livestock from predators.
Kleisner and Stella (2009) point to “the fact that many parallel characters have 
appeared in various domestic forms that [were] selected for different purposes”, and 
theorize that “parallel similarities appear in different groups in response to their 
interaction with the umwelt of a particular host” (ibid: 454), namely the human 
Umwelt. This has magnified the impact of human activities and was the starting 
point for the organization of complex ecologies around humans and their 
11  Human Agency and Ecology

321
settlements. Animal husbandry made not only the establishment of villages, but also 
the establishment of towns and eventually cities possible, thus gradually changing 
the social organization of human communities drastically. Tønnessen (2010a) out-
lines how an expanding human ecology eventually gave rise to several global spe-
cies affiliated with the human species, including both animal and plant species.
In modern times, the keeping of animals has continued growing in volume and 
ecological impact despite a gradual transition from sustenance agriculture globally 
to shrinking numbers of increasingly effective farmers. From a phenomenological 
perspective, this has meant that a growing number of animals are born into human 
captivity or custody and live their lives in human-made or human-controlled envi-
ronments, with livestock held for food production purposes now being the most 
prominent category of contemporary mammals (Bar-On et al., 2018). At the same 
time, the majority of human beings now live in environments where they no longer 
encounter farm animals.
In extension of the discourse on domestication of animals, some scholars have 
theorized that the domestication process also had profound effects on humans, 
resulting in ‘human domestication’ (see e.g. Leach, 2003). In this view, sedentism 
or other lifestyle changes triggered human beings to become more collaborative and 
docile (i.e., ‘domesticated’). Leach (ibid: 360) argues that human domestication 
was the result of “the artificial protective environment created by humans and shared 
progressively with animals and plants”, which contributed to an increase and conse-
quent concentration of their numbers and to conscious or unconscious interference 
in breeding. For the human, the combination of adoption of a built environment, 
change in diet consistency, and lowered mobility brought about morphological 
changes similar to those seen in certain domestic animals.
From a biosemiotic perspective, this might make sense, since changes in human–
animal relations tend to have effects for humans and animals alike, and environmen-
tal changes are dynamical by nature (cf. Fig.  11.1). At any rate, portraying a 
domestication process as entirely controlled by humans appears misleading, given 
that animals too have semiotic agency and adapt and behave dynamically.
11.4  The Ecological Function 
of Human-Animal Assemblages
A special case of human–animal complexes is the human–animal assemblage, 
which is characterized by the intimate association and highly coordinated behavior 
of a human and an animal. From an phenomenological perspective, the human 
Umwelt and the animal Umwelt are more tightly interlinked for humans and ani-
mals partaking in human–animal assemblages than for humans and animals that 
partake in other forms of human–animal complexes, where the human and the ani-
mal may in some cases not interact at all. Functionally, a human–animal assemblage 
may appear to be one organized unit (for example, consider a rider and a horse, or a

blind person with a guide dog – cf. Magnus, 2016), and its ecological functioning 
will also tend to be unitary. In cases where a human–animal assemblage is con-
trolled and directed by human agency, the assemblage enables the human being to 
increase its functional range and impact by intent momentarily. Shepherd dogs are 
an example of animals partaking in a human–animal assemblage that has the explicit 
purpose of controlling other animals, in this case a flock of sheep (for a zoosemiotic 
analysis, see Westling, 2014). Shepherd dogs are simultaneously an example of 
working animals. In some cases, companion animals – i.e., animals held for com-
pany – can also partake in human–animal assemblages, provided that they are highly 
coordinated with their human companions. Some animals, such as shepherd dogs, 
guarding dogs, and police dogs, are in contemporary times usually held privately on 
par with companion animals, and thus serve a dual purpose for their keepers.
Working animals come in many forms, including service animals, livestock 
(“production animals”), and animals used for transportation and related purposes. 
The use of working animals for transport or tillage is known as ‘animal traction’, 
and includes passenger and pack transport as well as various forms of pulling work 
(Starkey, 2005). “In various parts of the world”, as Starkey (ibid: 478) write, “cattle, 
buffaloes, yaks, horses, donkeys, mules,3 camels, llamas, elephants, reindeer, goats 
and dogs are used for transport, crop cultivation, water-raising, milling, logging and 
land excavation or levelling.” While different species are or have been important in 
different parts of the world, overall, oxen have been particularly important for 
ploughing of fields, and horses for animal-powered transport.
It is especially clear that humans and animals form functional human–animal 
assemblages in cases that involves riding and in cases where animals pull sledges, 
carts or carriages operated by humans. In these cases, the working animals and 
humans have to be highly coordinated in both physical and temporal terms. But 
working animals also in effect form assemblages with humans in cases where they 
carry out functions defined by humans without physical proximity to the humans as 
controlling agents, as in the case of carrier pigeons.
Horses were first domesticated around 4000 B.C. and have for millennia been 
important for human transport. For several centuries they had a profound impact on 
urban sceneries. They have also played a central role in warfare. While their role in 
transport has diminished in many parts of the world after the advent of the car (see 
McShane & Tarr, 2003), horses still carry out traditional work in parts of South 
America, Asia, Africa and Eastern Europe (FAO, 2020). In other parts of the world, 
such as in several Western countries, horses are now mostly kept for recreational or 
therapeutical purposes or for sport.

11.5  Sustainability: How to Address 
Environmental Problems
Two opposite approaches to addressing environmental problems and achieving sus-
tainability are represented by deep ecology (Næss, 1989) and ecomodernism 
(Asafu-Adjaye et al., 2015). The standpoint of deep ecology is that the ecological 
crisis is likely to accelerate until fundamental changes are made in our worldview, 
values, ideology, the economy and our use of technology. This presupposes a turn 
from seeking economic growth to appreciating the quality of life, and a turn from 
anthropocentric values and worldviews (where only human interests are consid-
ered) to values and worldviews that incorporate an acknowledgement of non-­
humans. The standpoint of ecomodernism, in contrast, implies that solving the 
environmental crisis requires acceleration in our modernization efforts combined 
with a more targeted use of land and technology. Unlike deep ecology, ecomodern-
ism is distinctively anthropocentric in that its adherents typically refer only to the 
human valuation of non-humans and their interests when considering different solu-
tions to environmental problems, rather than making any reference to the value of 
non-humans in their own right. Judging by the standards of deep ecology (Næss, 
1973), ecomodernist thought belongs to the ‘shallow’ ecology movement and not to 
the ‘deep’ ecology movement. Eileen Crist (2015) suggests that a fundamental 
problem with the ecomodernist outlook is that whereas human freedom is consid-
ered a core value – particularly “the social and material freedoms that modernity 
offers” (ibid: 250) – the freedom of non-humans is in effect neglected or actively 
suppressed.
Attempts to integrate ecosemiotics and deep ecology as perspectives on the eco-
logical crisis have been made by Tønnessen (2003), Kull et al., (2004) and Kull 
(2011).4 A feature of the deep ecological perspective that is a good fit with ecosemi-
otics, is its insistence on the value and relevance of non-human lifeforms and ways 
of life. From the perspective of this book, this can suitably be framed in terms of the 
semiotic agency of non-human organisms, and the ecological relations they engage 
in. This is also consistent with the idea of biosemiotic ethics (Tønnessen & Beever, 
2014), which locates the basis for moral consideration in the capacity for semi-
otic agency.
One of Næss’ friends and sources of inspiration was the Norwegian eco-­
existentialist Peter Wessel Zapffe (1899–1990), who, like Næss, was an outdoor 
recreation enthusiast and mountain climber, and who early called for nature conser-
vation and protection of wilderness areas. In Chap. 2, we saw examples of anthro-
pocentric existentialism – and existentialism has mostly been an anthropocentric 
endeavor, with the eco-existentialism of Zapffe (1993 [1933], 1996 [1941]) 
representing a rare exemption. While any kind of existentialism focuses on human 
agency, only instances of eco-existentialism such as that of Zapffe problematizes 
4 For a thorough treatment of this, and also of the opposition between deep ecology and ecomod-
ernism, see Tønnessen, 2021.

324
the role that human agency plays in an ecological context. It is also a significant fact 
that Zapffe (1996 [1941]) builds the foundation of his biological outlook on von 
Uexküll’s Umwelt theory.
From a wholistic perspective, we need solutions that make it easier and not 
harder to solve other environmental problems. For example, diets with less meat and 
animal products will require less land and energy use, thus improving human health 
while also facilitating the achievement of biodiversity and climate change goals 
(EAT–Lancet Commission, 2019).5 In a similar manner, natural climate solutions 
such as natural reforestation and more generally rewilding contributes to solving the 
climate change problem while simultaneously contributing to reinvigorate and safe-
guard biodiversity (Griscom et al., 2017). In extension of this, solutions to environ-
mental problems should also be compatible with safeguarding the social welfare of 
human beings (O’Neill et al., 2018). This implies assessing the resource use associ-
ated with meeting human needs and making sure that high welfare levels are 
achieved in ways that are environmentally sustainable in a short- and long-term 
perspective.
Figure 11.2 shows a model for societal transformations that builds on and further 
develops the model depicted in Fig. 11.1. This model is applicable on the human 
species only, and it is applicable on various social transformations, not just the soci-
etal transformation that is now needed to make human societies sustainable. Human 
5 A more vegetarian diet is also in line with more proper consideration of animal welfare concerns, 
provided that the lower emphasis on the quantity of meat, egg and milk produced is supplemented 
with more emphasis on the quality of these products, in a way that incorporates ethical concerns 
related to the living conditions of the animals involved in the production.

societies have always relied on the natural environment and adjusted to a changing 
environment. The difference this time is the accelerating speed of several anthropo-
genic environmental changes, which point towards trajectories for environmental 
change that appear very troublesome. Our socio-cultural development path, related 
to our human Innenwelt, and our socio-ecological development path, related to our 
human Umwelt, will have to adjust constructively in order to make sure that envi-
ronmental change does not spiral out of control. This will involve changes in our 
human values, beliefs, worldview and behavior, just like deep ecology prescribes 
(Næss, 1973, 1989).
Amongst other things, the required societal transformation will involve a funda-
mental revision of our economic outlook. So far, we have thought that only human 
beings are economic stakeholders, that only human beings desire goods and need 
resources, and in consequence, we have thought of economics as a field of study 
where human valuation is the only relevant kind of valuation. In the future, we will 
have to learn to think about other organisms as economic stakeholders, too, and to 
acknowledge the value of what they consider to be valuable as well. This will 
require a new attitude to goods and to resources, since we will have to acknowledge 
that we are not the only living beings on this planet with desires, values and needs 
(Tønnessen, 2020b).
11.6  Animal Welfare: Facilitating Autonomy 
and Needs-­Fulfilment in Animal Husbandry
In this subsection we address how the perspective of semiotic agency can inform 
discussions about animal welfare in the context of animal husbandry. Since the 
enactment of the semiotic agency of individual animals is telling of, and central to, 
their needs, we think that acknowledging the semiotic agency of domesticated ani-
mals should entail that the autonomy of these animals is facilitated, and their needs-­
fulfilment accommodated.6
In current agriculture, particularly industrialized forms of animal husbandry, 
plenty of attention is paid to needs-fulfilment for domesticated animals, whereas the 
autonomy of domesticated animals received less consideration. This is partly 
because needs-fulfilment is on some points, particularly related to feeding and 
health, required in order to maintain or enhance productivity in livestock systems. 
Facilitation of the autonomy of domesticated animals, on the other hand, is often 
regarded as either unwarranted given the use of animals in agriculture as production 
animals, or impractical given the detrimental effects such facilitation may have on 
productivity.
There are, however, some examples of innovative, modern animal husbandry 
practices that facilitate the domesticated animals’ autonomy without having any

negative effect on productivity. For example, while animals are typically tied up in 
a stall in traditional stall barns, in a loose housing barn, animals can move more 
freely. Many loose housing systems for dairy cows are equipped with milking robots 
and ample opportunities for feeding at will. In these systems the dairy cows can 
basically choose when to feed, and when to be milked. This facilitates the animals’ 
autonomy to a considerable extent compared to how feeding and milking is orga-
nized in stall barns. However, both stall barns and loose housing barns are in-door 
systems, which have some disadvantages compared to out-door pastures which give 
dairy cows and other animals more dietary choices while also letting them choose 
freely when to feed.7
In industrialized forms of animal husbandry involving dairy cows, the mother 
cow and the calf are usually separated straight after the calf’s birth for production 
purposes. This compromises one of the most fundamental animal needs for many 
mammals, namely the caregiving and bonding that takes place within the mother–
neonate relation. Researchers (e.g. (Johnsen et al., 2015a) have investigated the sig-
nificance of nursing (suckling) for the cow–calf bond. This experimental study 
concluded that the cow and the calf “form a bond independent of nursing”, when 
they are allowed to be together (ibid: 50). When given a chance to suckle, the calf 
would do that, but those that were instead fed by an automated milk feeder demon-
strated similar inclinations to allogroom with their dam (mother), and to reunite 
with them after having been separated from each other. An implication of these 
findings is that the cow and the calf’s social need for forming a cow–calf bond can 
be met and facilitated without any suckling.
Another study (Johnsen et al., 2015b) shows that physical contact between dairy 
cows and calves after having been physically separated by a fence-line reduces 
stress and thus improves animal welfare. This was measured by comparing distress 
vocalizations and alert behaviour in form of high-head posture with ears pointing 
towards the cow for two groups of cows and calves, with cows and calves in one 
group having visual and physical contact over/under a fence-line, and cows and 
calves in the other group being separated by a wall and having only auditory contact 
(ibid: 11).
From a biosemiotic perspective, these findings make good sense. Social needs 
and feeding needs may overlap to some extent e.g. in the sense that the nursing situ-
ation gives opportunities for bonding, but sociality and feeding nevertheless satis-
fies distinct needs, as von Uexküll makes clear with his distinction between the most 
common functional cycles, which includes that of the partner and that of food/nutri-
tion.8 Physical proximity in a barn is not sufficient for satisfying social needs if 
communication channels and different opportunities for contact are blocked or 
thwarted. By facilitating physical, visual, auditory etc. contact, the forming of 
7 In out-door environments, humans are responsible for protecting animals in their care from preda-
tors, whether by herding, secure fences, or by other means.
8 Strictly speaking, the functional cycle of the partner is in Uexküll’s work restricted to the sexual 
partner, but in a generalized form it may be understood as relating more widely to any social part-
ner (cf. treatment in Tønnessen, 2014: 167–170).
11  Human Agency and Ecology

327
healthy social bonds and the fulfilment of basic social needs have much better 
chances. This concerns needs-fulfilment, but also autonomy, since more “open” sys-
tems that allow for various forms of contact between cows and calves (and compa-
rable mother–neonate relations) also facilitate autonomy by giving the animals 
more choices in their social relations.
A general animal welfare challenge for most domesticated animals concerns 
reproduction. Both in agriculture and in zoological gardens, the animals’ reproduc-
tion tends to be tightly controlled by humans.9 This limits or does completely away 
with the reproductive autonomy of the animals, and may also eliminate their chance 
for courtship. Another widespread concern relates to mass sociality, which is the 
social context for some livestock species in industrialized agriculture, particularly 
for poultry and pigs. Any animal needs social support, and this should be facilitated 
(Rault, 2012). These welfare problems are considerable, and hard to solve satisfac-
torily within an industrial-type framework. Proper solutions would for some species 
require more small-scale farming in the case of mass sociality, and an entirely dif-
ferent form of animal husbandry in the case of reproductive autonomy.
It is also worth keeping in mind that cognitively complex animals, as livestock 
often are, may have individual needs in addition to species-specific needs (Richter 
& Hintze, 2019). This speaks in favor of meeting the particular needs not only of 
each particular species, but also of each particular individual animal, taking its spe-
cific situation and preferences into account (cf. the biosemiotic particularism pro-
moted in Beever & Tønnessen, 2017, and Kull, 2001 and his emphasis on the 
subjective experience of animals).
11.7  Wildlife Management: Facilitating Autonomy in Wild 
Animals and Other Wildlife
In this final subsection we address how the perspective of semiotic agency can 
inform discussions about animal welfare in the context of wildlife management. 
Unlike what is the case for domesticated animals, the needs of wild animals are 
seldom met with the direct involvement of human beings. While the connection 
between the animal’s semiotic agency and needs is basically the same for wild ani-
mals as for domesticated animals (with the animal’s agency tailored to pursue 
needs-fulfilment), the issue of needs-fulfilment must therefore be framed in a differ-
ent light. No matter how human beings can accommodate the needs of wild animals, 
this must for the most part happen indirectly and have the effect that wild animals 
are enabled to fulfil their needs on their own. This presupposes that wild animals are 
granted ample access to land and resources, and that direct human interference with 
their lives is restrained.
9 For a zoosemiotic analysis of zoos, see Mäekivi, 2018.
11.7  Wildlife Management: Facilitating Autonomy in Wild Animals and Other Wildlife

328
Facilitating autonomy in wild animals and other wildlife may be an even more 
important task than bearing responsibility for needs-fulfilment in this context. This 
is, firstly, because the autonomy of wild animals is often neglected or infringed 
upon by current wildlife management practices, which often relies on lethal man-
agement methods (bluntly speaking, culling) and zoning practices involving geo-
graphical zones where specific wild species are deemed unwelcome. And secondly, 
because if the autonomy of wild animals is not facilitated, this will also complicate 
needs-fulfilment. Predators, for instance, need access to natural prey; in the absence 
of natural prey species, many predators are left either starving, migrating, or getting 
too close to human settlements in search of food.
More use of non-lethal management methods (discussed in Tønnessen, 2016) 
would give wild animals including predators more freedom to roam around. It 
would still be possible to manage their whereabouts, by scaring tactics etc., when 
needed in order to protect e.g. livestock or children. A counterargument could be 
that non-lethal wildlife management would not allow us to control their population 
sizes. However, humans’ current predation patterns imply that adult prey and thus 
the reproductive capital of populations is targeted at much higher rates than what is 
the case for other predators (Darimont et al., 2015). This is one of the reasons why 
current hunting and fishing practices lead to unsustainable population declines for 
several species. Changed predation patterns and reduced predation is required for 
the sake of restoring biodiversity (IPBES, 2019; WWF, 2018).
Besides giving wildlife more space and opportunity to flourish, we should also 
make sure that human activities do not disturb wild animals too much, e.g. by all the 
noises that motorized and industrialized activities generate today, over land as well 
as over and under water, resulting in a sort of auditory pollution which disturbs 
several animals (cf. (Farina, 2016).
On a final note, we will have a look at ‘mixed communities’ of humans and ani-
mals, and briefly discuss what possibilities these offer for human interaction with 
animals. The notion of mixed communities was introduced by Arne Næss (1974) to 
promote conviviality between humans and non-humans, which he envisioned to live 
within one and the same environment. The notion has a non-anthropocentric flavor 
given the more-than-human understanding of communities as including both 
humans and non-humans that it relies on. It further contrasts with the zoning prac-
tices mentioned above, for which the impulse is that wild animals, domesticated 
animals, and humans should live in separate areas.
Næss’ article was written to comment on conflicts involving large predators, 
specifically wolves and brown bears, and their occasional predation on sheep in 
more or less remote pastures. Under normal circumstances, human beings cannot, 
of course, interact with wild animals such as wolves and bears in the same way as 
humans can interact with domesticated animals such as sheep. The kind of human–
animal relationships that could be established in a mixed community would there-
fore necessarily have to be diversified, with proximity to some animals and respectful 
distance to others.
Næss’ mixed community has some empirical parallels both historically and in 
some parts of the contemporary world, where animals were, or are, intermingling

with the general population of human beings, some places even in urban areas. 
Considering conviviality as a morally attractive scenario, it is a fair vision for a 
sustainable future world. It would also resonate well with some of the thinking of 
political philosopher and animal advocate Will Kymlicka (2018), including his idea 
that human rights should be based on what we have in common with animals, such 
as sentience and dignity, rather than on what distinguishes us from them. Such a 
mindset about ourselves, animals, and physical organization of mixed human–ani-
mal settlements, would also enable us to care for animal and human welfare in one 
and the same context, as some (e.g. Pinillos et al., 2016) have suggested we should 
(cf. the One welfare agenda).

Agentology: Crosspollination of Science 
and Philosophy
Abstract  We call the science on semiotic agency in all its forms ‘agentology’, 
adopting the term coined by Tomáš Šalamon. The establishment of this new disci-
pline is justified by the fact that the class of all agents is easily distinguishable from 
other things in the universe by empirical studies. In our perspective, agentology is 
inspired by and can draw from biosemiotics, which provides a rich philosophy of 
science platform capable of integrating sister disciplines including information the-
ory, constructivism, enactivism, evolutionary epistemology, and phenomenology. 
Biosemiotics offers naturalization of semiotics and, unlike most competing theo-
ries, steps boldly into the post-mechanistic multi-disciplinary domain of science. 
Only phenomenology has developed some similar ideas which are compatible with 
a semiotic understanding of reality. But phenomenology is currently not sufficiently 
naturalized in dialogue with empirical sciences and can therefore not by itself pro-
vide a similarly rich foundation for agentology.
12.1  Emergence of Agentology
The concluding chapter is conceived to develop a more general idea on the science 
of agency, which we call agentology. The term was defined by Tomáš Šalamon, 
(2011: 103) as “the methodology for developing agent-based models” and applied 
to the analysis of humans, non-human animals, and artificial intelligence (AI). Here 
we understand agentology in a broader sense as research on semiotic agency, includ-
ing on organisms’ autonomy and semiotic freedom, which are ideas inspired by 
biosemiotics. We see the perspective of agentology thus understood as a novel way 
of thinking with broad interest for the life sciences, and think that it deserves to be 
considered as a distinct paradigm of science (Kuhn, 1970). In a similar sense, Robert 
Ulanowicz (2009), in his book A Third Window, considered the study of agency as 
involving an alternative view on nature which is distinct from the preceding con-
cepts of law-based causation formulated by Newton and stochastic process-based 
dynamics, represented by evolutionary and ecological theories.

334
Biosemiotics has already been presented as a new paradigm (Anderson et al., 
1984), but it has suffered from an internal split between studying protosemiosis and 
code biology on one hand and building on Peirce’s anthropocentric semiotics where 
agency is deemphasized and not included into the sign relation, on the other hand. 
There is a need for an integrated, empirically based notion of agency that is not 
reduced to a single function, such as e.g. ‘interpreter’, ‘observer’, ‘sign maker’ or 
‘actor/operator’. In our perspective, agency is rather a unity of various interrelated 
semiotic and physical functions. We believe that focusing on agency-centered semi-
otics and integrating mechanistic and non-mechanistic approaches within the agen-
tology umbrella can reunite factions in biosemiotics, and also attract researchers 
from sister disciplines such as information theory, constructivism, evolutionary 
epistemology, enactivism, and phenomenology.
The new discipline of agentology is justified by the fact that the class of all 
agents is well separated from other non-agential objects in the universe. As dis-
cussed in Chap. 6, agents have an extended ontological status due to the fact that 
their existence is purposeful. The class of agents is closed via a production relation; 
and only agents are semiotic beings. Agentology is largely based on the principles 
of biosemiotics, but unlike biosemiotics, it fully encompasses human agency, tech-
nological agency,1 and ecosemiotics. Another important difference is that agentol-
ogy emphasizes the leading role of agency, knowledge, and learning, and is thus 
agent-centered, whereas biosemiotics is traditionally focused on the work done by 
signs, while the role of agents is acknowledged to varying degrees.
The novelty of agentology becomes clear if we take a look back in time and 
compare it with the preceding major scientific paradigms. Aristotle’s philosophy is 
one of the earliest paradigms of science that introduced a detailed vocabulary for 
describing natural variations of things, their causes, and dynamics. It replaced a 
large portion of pre-scientific metaphysics that relied mostly on essence- or rule-­
based reasoning. The next paradigm was Newtonian and modern physics which 
elaborated the notion of efficient causality in the form of universal laws and deter-
minism. This boosted the development of experimental science and technology, but 
totally eliminated agency and intentionality from science. A third paradigm emerged 
with the evolutionary and ecological theories of Lamarck, Darwin, and Haeckel.2 In 
these theories, the agential nature of organisms was accepted to a certain extent; but 
Darwin and his followers emphasized mechanistic elements in the evolutionary 
process.
Pioneer theories supporting the autonomy and goal-directedness of agents 
appeared at the end of the nineenth and beginning of the twentieth century. These 
included the works of Baldwin, Bergson, James, and von Uexküll. The influence of 
these theories, however, remained limited due to the general dominance of the 
mechanistic approaches in science (e.g., physics, chemistry, neo-Darwinism, and 
1 There is no consensus on whether technosemiotics is a part of biosemiotics.
2 The notion of ecology was coined by Haeckel in 1866; but the theories of Lamarck and Darwin 
are ecological in their core. Darwin (1866) called it the “economy of nature”.

genetics). The twentieth century brought a new paradigm in form of cybernetics and 
information theory, which added a new digital layer on the top of mechanistic think-
ing. The founders of cybernetics were interested in applying their ideas to animals 
and other organisms (Wiener, 1948; von Foerster, 1995), but the main direction of 
development in cybernetics was targeted at supporting computational technology, 
which is inherently deterministic.3 The emergence of molecular biology and genom-
ics at the turn of the twentieth century was a good fit with the cybernetic-­information 
paradigm and adopted its terminology (e.g., information, code, transcription, trans-
lation, and error).
Interest towards autonomous agents started growing in science from the end of 
twentieth century and onwards. This trend can be seen in various domains of sci-
ence and the humanities. Second-order cybernetics and artificial intelligence study 
autonomous agents and adaptive adjustment of regulatory circuits (von Foerster, 
2003). The Extended Evolutionary Synthesis acknowledged goal-directedness and 
creativity at various levels of biological organization (Pigliucci & Müller, 2010). 
Physiology and behavioral science crossed the boundaries of deterministic 
approaches, and moved beyond simple reflexes. Cognitive science developed a 
multi-agent concept of “society of mind” (Minsky, 1986). Linguistics has to some 
extent merged with semiotics and elaborated the pragmatic aspects of language. 
Philosophy has assumed more flexible positions towards the meaning of truth, 
which has resulted in the emergence of areas such as evolutionary epistemology and 
radical constructivism. However, the major advances in the study of agents have 
been made in the interdisciplinary areas of biosemiotics and enactivism.
12.2  Biosemiotics – An Integrating Platform 
for Agential Studies
Agential studies are currently spread over separate disciplines and factions and we 
would like to advocate the need for unification. Our analysis indicates that the most 
comprehensive approach to semiotic agency is based on biosemiotic theory, which 
can be considered as the core of agentology. However, biosemiotics needs to accom-
modate additional concepts that originate from information theory, constructivism, 
enactivism, and phenomenology. Some key points are highlighted in the following 
subsections.

machine learning.

12.2.1  Connections with Information Theory
Information theory is strongly influenced by the mechanistic paradigm, and for this 
reason it has been criticized by scholars in biosemiotics (Hoffmeyer, 2008; Brier, 
2008). However, probabilistic models of information theory depict the lowest level 
of sign processes that is performed by mechanisms well. This means that biosemiot-
ics can be integrated with information theory and provide agential grounding for, 
and evolutionary explanations of, probabilistic models by placing them within a 
wider context and avoid oversimplified mechanistic interpretations. This will imply 
to consider agential properties, such as the goals, benefits, autonomy, and life cycle 
of organisms, as well as the evolutionary consequences of agential properties. Let 
us discuss a couple of examples where biosemiotics can supplement information 
theory and provide better explanations of biological phenomena.
Probabilistic models of natural selection, such as Fisher’s theorem (Fisher, 1930) 
or Price equation (Price, 1972, 1995), predict that the frequency of deleterious 
alleles tends to decrease in a sequence of generations, whereas the frequency of 
beneficial alleles tends to increase. The former prediction is supported by genomic 
data showing the evolutionary conservation of functionally important regions of the 
genome. These regions are conserved because of the so-called purifying selection, 
which means the preferential survival and reproduction of non-mutated genotypes. 
In contrast, the latter prediction, on beneficial alleles, has no support from genom-
ics, since there are no beneficial mutations. The notion of a beneficial mutation is a 
misnomer, because all mutations are random damages of the DNA code. A text or a 
message would never get more informative due to errors; so why should we expect 
an adaptive effect from errors in the genome? Regardless of this point, biological 
evolution does indeed show a clear tendency towards developing adaptive pheno-
type features, as if beneficial mutations existed.
Biosemiotics resolves this dilemma by making two assumptions. First, the sur-
vival and reproduction of organisms is frequently challenged by mutations and/or 
external disturbances, therefore the life of organisms is a struggle for existence. The 
notion of a struggle for existence was introduced by Charles Darwin, although he 
mostly emphasized external factors, underestimating the importance of internal dis-
turbances. If organisms existed in optimal conditions, there would be no room for 
their improvement. Metaphorically, a person standing on the top of a hill has no 
option to go further up. The second assumption biosemiotics makes is that mutated 
DNA sequences are interpreted by a hierarchy of subagents such as protein com-
plexes, organelles, cells, and organs. These subagents are products of long-term 
evolution, and have acquired “experience” in solving various living problems such 
as detoxifying chemicals, fighting infection, using alternative sources of metabolic 
energy, and transferring regulatory signals within cells and between organs. 
Subagents are therefore capable of ameliorating existing living problems, and muta-
tions can happen to activate some of these capacities via one signaling pathway or 
another. In summary, there are no beneficial mutations, but mutations can in some 
12  Agentology: Crosspollination of Science and Philosophy

337
cases be interpreted in a beneficial way by subagents in various stages of the 
life cycle.
A second example of biosemiotic reinterpretation of probabilistic models belongs 
to cognitive science. In the first half of the twentieth century, the dominating para-
digm for studying animal behavior was behaviorism, which was focused on external 
factors’ effect on animal behaviour (Skinner, 1938, 1981). Elementary behaviors 
were explained as either innate instincts or learned conditioned reflexes. These 
behaviors were treated as neural mechanisms triggered by external stimuli. The 
main motivation for developing this methodology was a desire to consider only 
directly observable facts about animal behavior. Behaviorism thus rejected attempts 
to reconstruct the internal mental states of animals, regarding these as inaccessible 
for scientific exploration.
A different approach was proposed by Jakob von Uexküll (1982 [1940]), who 
assumed that animals develop internal models of their environment, summarized in 
the notion of an Umwelt. In his view, external stimuli are perceived by organisms as 
signs that require interpretation; in other words, perception is meaningful. The 
Umwelt theory is semiotic in its spirit, although Uexküll only used semiotic termi-
nology of his own and was not familiar with the semiotic theory of his time. The 
advantage of Umwelt theory in comparison to behaviorism is that it explains that 
instincts and conditioned reflexes are elements of a larger cognitive system that 
encompasses complex interpretation processes, and makes clear that animals are 
capable of active meaning-making.
The publications of Uexküll remained mostly unknown to English-speaking 
scholars at that time. Only a few researchers acknowledged his contribution to 
ethology (Sebeok, 1972, 1976). However, many biologists became dissatisfied with 
behaviorism and realized the importance of considering internal mental states for 
explaining animal behavior. Instead of the semiotic Umwelt theory, several of them 
advocated a computer metaphor for mental activities (Dennett, 1991). Such a posi-
tion became known as cognitivism. In one of the most popular versions of this the-
ory, internal mental states are interpreted as probabilistic hypotheses that are used 
for computing expectations. When the outcome is different from the expectation, 
the difference is called a “prediction error”. In this view, learning is understood as 
minimization of prediction error (Schultz & Dickinson, 2000; Schultz, 2016). 
Another version of this model is called the Free Energy Principle (Friston et al., 
2006). Although these models are useful for solving specific optimization problems 
in AI, they do not explain the phenomenon of animal cognition. Cognition consti-
tutes a larger and more complex semiotic system, where processes that are respon-
sible for minimization of prediction errors only represent a small part of the whole 
system. Uexküll’s Umwelt theory is substantially richer than cognitivism, because 
it captures the emergence of cognitive states in evolution and in individual develop-
ment. A fundamental point is that the objects surrounding an animal are interpreted 
in relation to the organism’s living functions. Sentient animals are capable of cate-
gorizing objects and associating them with previous experiences. Their cognitive 
system is based on sign relations and is not reducible to computation. Computation 
processes change the states of pre-existing elements (transistors), whereas mental

338
activity includes construction of new cognitive elements: object categories, ideas, 
feelings, emotions, which we collectively call ‘concepts’. On the neurophysiologi-
cal level, these new elements can be represented by neurons, synapses, self-­
organizing organelles, or proteins with new conformations. Cognition is always 
embodied and cannot be fully separated from the activities of the whole organism. 
This implies that body construction and niche construction are integrated with cog-
nition. To sum up, biosemiotics can place information theory models within a 
broader semiotic context.
12.2.2  Connections with Constructivism 
and Evolutionary Epistemology
Constructivism4 generally denotes a theory of human knowledge that emphasizes 
the importance of active involvement of learning subjects in knowledge-building 
and rejects the idea that knowledge comes via passive imprinting or copying 
(Riegler, 2006; Tobias & Duffy, 2009). In systems science, constructivism is used to 
describe agents that actively modify the world as opposed to assuming passive 
observers and predictors (Klir, 1991). In philosophy, the term has been used to 
emphasize that behaviors are often not guided directly by the real world, but appear 
mediated by previously constructed internal representations of reality (Liu & 
Matthews, 2005). In this aspect, constructivism can be misinterpreted as implying 
that mental representations are not constrained by reality. However, if we accept the 
notion of a unity between mind and body, evolution and cognition, and the indi-
vidual and the social, as emphasized by Vygotsky (Liu & Matthews, 2005) and 
Piaget (Piaget & Inhelder, 1967), then internal representations are strongly con-
strained (although not strictly determined) by various interactions (both physical 
and cultural) in the past. In this way, constructivism is closely linked with the phi-
losophy of pragmatism (James, 1954; Dewey, 1998).
The theory of meaning developed by von Uexküll can also be regarded as related 
to pragmatism and constructivism (Sharov, 2001). The ideas of constructivism in 
relation to biology were further developed by von Foerster and Bateson (Riegler, 
2006). The theory of code biology attempts to link construction of meaning with 
semiotics (Barbieri, 2003, 2008). In particular, Barbieri considers the synthesis of 
polypeptides based on the genetic code as involving construction of meanings (i.e., 
meaning-making). Construction of knowledge can be recursive (i.e., built upon 
results of previous acts of construction) (Bickhard, 2005), and can therefore generate 
complex self-sustaining processes that are equivalent or at least close to what we call 
‘semiosis’. Several researchers have explored the relations between biosemiotics 
and constructivism (Bielecka, 2012; Brier 2008; Huber & Schmidt-Tannwald, 2008; 
4 It is closely related to constructionism (Noss & Clayson, 2015) and evolutionary epistemology 
(Riegler, 2006).
12  Agentology: Crosspollination of Science and Philosophy

339
Favareau, 2010; Vehkavaara & Sharov, 2017). In particular, the origin of life can be 
understood in light of the emergence of simple self-constructing semiotic networks 
that have progressively increased their complexity in evolution (Sharov, 2016).
An important development was the emergence of radical constructivism, as pro-
posed by Ernst von Glasersfeld (von Glasersfeld, 1984), who assumed that knowl-
edge is a kind of biological adaptation and may not necessarily represent reality by 
way of any iconic correspondence. In other words, agential knowledge fits to reality, 
in a Darwinian sense, but it does not necessarily involve representational relations 
to it. We see the merit of radical constructivism in focusing on the pragmatic rela-
tion between knowledge and reality, which is indeed a fundamental feature of 
agency. This is especially important for understanding the behavior of primitive 
organisms such as bacteria, which apparently cannot perceive objects in the envi-
ronment (Sharov & Vehkavaara, 2015).
Evolutionary epistemology needs to be mentioned among other philosophic the-
ories of cognition that are strongly linked with constructivism and James’s pragma-
tism. The term “evolutionary epistemology” was coined by Donald Campbell 
(1974), but its theoretical roots can be traced back to Baldwin (1896), who devel-
oped a “genetic epistemology” and proposed a model of evolution where animal 
behaviors are both products and factors of evolution. The central idea of evolution-
ary epistemology is that our understanding of human knowledge should be natural-
ized. It achieves this, in particular, by applying concepts of biological evolution to 
the accumulation of animal and human knowledge and the development of cogni-
tion (Campbell, 1974; Gontier, 2006b). Knowledge is then seen as a form of adapta-
tion that evolves by mechanisms that are similar to natural selection, e.g., by testing 
hypotheses (Popper, 1972). Cambell’s understanding of evolution is mostly neo-­
Darwinean, whereas, Franz Wuketits (2006) argues that seeing adaptation as a mat-
ter of fitting to the environment is an oversimplified approach, and suggests that 
internal factors such as adaptability are no less important in the evolution of knowl-
edge. Another development in evolutionary epistemology is the recognition that 
horizontal evolution (i.e., via symbiosis and communication) plays an important 
role in the evolution of knowledge and is complementary to the traditionally 
acknowledged vertical evolution (i.e., via succession of generations) (Gontier, 
2006a). Among other things, the notion of horizontal evolution can help us to under-
stand better the historical development of human languages.
12.2.3  Connections with Enactivism
The phenomenon of agency is central to both enactivism and biosemiotics 
(Tønnessen, 2016). Enactivism was first launched by Varela, Thompson and Rosch 
(1991) as a cognitive extension of the autopoiesis theory (Maturana & Varela, 1980), 
where autopoiesis is understood as a process by which living systems maintain 
themselves. This is how Evan Thompson (2007: 13) describes the main ideas of 
enactivism:
12.2  Biosemiotics – An Integrating Platform for Agential Studies

340
The first idea is that living beings are autonomous agents that actively generate and main-
tain themselves, and thereby also enact or bring forth their own cognitive domains. The 
second idea is that the nervous system is an autonomous dynamic system: It actively gener-
ates and maintains its own coherent and meaningful patterns of activity, according to its 
operation as a circular and reentrant network of interacting neurons. The nervous system 
does not process information in the computationalist sense, but creates meaning. The third 
idea is that cognition is the exercise of skillful know-how in situated and embodied action. 
Cognitive structures and processes emerge from recurrent sensorimotor patterns of percep-
tion and action. Sensorimotor coupling between organism and environment modulates, but 
does not determine, the formation of endogenous, dynamic patterns of neural activity, 
which in turn inform sensorimotor coupling. The fourth idea is that a cognitive being’s 
world is not a prespecified, external realm, represented internally by its brain, but a 
­relational domain enacted or brought forth by that being’s autonomous agency and mode of 
coupling with the environment. The fifth idea is that experience is not an epiphenomenal 
side issue, but central to any understanding of the mind, and needs to be investigated in a 
careful phenomenological manner.
As presented here by Thompson, all five ideas by and large resonate well with the 
perspective of biosemiotics, though the latter stands out by being more positive to 
notions of representation and by regarding most biological activity as sign-based. In 
enactivism, the concept of agency appears essential because, according to Cameron 
(2001: 456),
Autopoiesis does not logically require agency, but an autopoietic entity will only survive 
insofar as the dynamic adaptation of its structural coupling can maintain those variables 
essential to its autopoiesis within their essential limits in an unpredictable environment, and 
this requires agency.
Barandiaran et al. (2009: 1) defined agency as “an autonomous organization that 
adaptively regulates its coupling with its environment and contributes to sustaining 
itself as a consequence” . They stipulate three specific conditions of agency, namely 
“a) a system must define its own individuality, b) it must be the active source of 
activity in its environment (interactional asymmetry) and c) it must regulate this 
activity in relation to certain norms (normativity)” (ibid.). Anthony Chemero (2009: 
386) assumes that “the agent and the environment are non-linearly coupled, they 
together constitute a non-decomposable system”. The idea of the agent–environ-
ment integration is not entirely new. It has been initially proposed as a part of the 
Umwelt theory by von Uexküll (1982 [1940]), but became more widely known 
from its formulation in the autopoiesis theory. In contrast to Maturana and Varela5, 
Barandiaran et al. (2009: 5) accepted the notion of normativity: “Agents have goals 
or norms according to which they are acting”. However, this version of enactivism 
does not acknowledge the semiotic nature of normativity and perception. In a fol-
low-­up paper, Barandiaran (2017) assumes a pluralist approach to the autonomy of 
agents, where multiple levels of autonomy are recognized: the autonomy of cells, 
multicellular organisms, behaviors, inter-subjective and social interactions.
The main difference between enactivism and biosemiotics is that enactivism 
relies on physics and self-organization as a theoretical foundation for agency and 
5 Maturana and Varela (1980) viewed teleology as unnecessary.
12  Agentology: Crosspollination of Science and Philosophy

avoids semiotic terms and reasoning. Enactivism is appealing to scholars who advo-
cate that all branches of science have a common physical basis and believe that 
semiotic theorizing is just a renaming game that does not bring with it any scientific 
value in terms of explaining phenomena. In other words, for enactivism, physics is 
the hallmark of science targeted at uncovering universal laws of nature, whereas for 
biosemiotics, physics is one of several epistemic approaches that have been success-
ful in developing satisfactory models of some aspects of reality.
Scholars who advocate biosemiotics emphasize the semiotic nature of agents. 
Semiosis is however not another name for soul, and biosemiotics does not attempt 
to revive the Cartesian dualism. Like enactivism, biosemiotic philosophy is also 
monistic rather than dualistic, because it accepts the origin of life from non-living 
matter, the origin of cognition from non-cognitive forms of life, and the importance 
of mechanisms in primitive forms of semiosis (i.e., in protosemiosis). The reason 
why biosemiotics accepts semiotic terminology is that physics and self-organization 
theories are not sufficient to explain such features of agency as autonomy, evolution, 
learning, and cognition. By itself, physics can only help us understand processes in 
inanimate nature and simple short-term processes in living systems (mostly those 
that can be replicated in vitro). This view cannot be dismissed as non-scientific, 
since biosemiotics is fully compatible with current knowledge in physics and other 
natural sciences and assumes that physical laws are not violated by living and cogni-
tive agents. In summary, it is legitimate to consider semiotics as providing an addi-
tional and complementary epistemic approach for the study of complex agents. 
Biochemistry is another example of an epistemic approach that cannot fully be 
reduced to physics and chemistry.
Despite the differences, a progressive tendency towards integration of enactivism 
with biosemiotics is observable. Andreas Weber (2001: 11) thus notes that theoreti-
cal developments in enactivism “can be fruitful for a Biosemiotic approach to 
organism”, and further points out that “Varela himself already applies concepts as 
e.g. ‘signification’, ‘relevance’, ‘meaning’ which are de facto Biosemiotic.” Weber 
also argues that the work of Varela “shows a close association of the fields of embod-
ied cognition, biological phenomenology, and semiotics, conflating in what could 
best be called a biology of subjective agents” (ibid: 12). A more recent example of 
convergence between enactivism and biosemiotics is Paolo de Jesus’ (2016) pro-
posal for a “biosemiotic enactivism”. As de Jesus argues, the Umwelt theory of 
Uexküll, Peirce’s foundational theorizing in semiotics, and more recent publica-
tions in biosemiotics by Sebeok, Hoffmeyer, and others can support the core argu-
ments in enactivism.
12.2.4  Connections with Phenomenology
Phenomenology is by many considered as the natural arena for studies of human 
consciousness and related phenomena, and the phenomenological movement has 
developed rich accounts on human agency. These are valuable contributions to 
12.2  Biosemiotics – An Integrating Platform for Agential Studies

agentology as we conceive of it. However, contemporary phenomenology has the 
following three major shortcomings. Firstly, it shows reluctance to discuss non-­
human consciousness and related phenomena, which means that it is not at present 
a comprehensive arena for studies of consciousness. Secondly, it shows reluctance 
to become fully integrated with relevant empirical sciences, which means that many 
forms of contemporary phenomenology end up as uninformed by the natural sci-
ences and unable to contribute to a proper understanding of real-world phenomena. 
And thirdly, it lacks semiotic contextualization of phenomenal experience, which 
means that phenomenology’s understanding of phenomena becomes more limited 
than it potentially can become.
Interaction with biosemiotics can help alleviate all these three shortcomings. By 
starting to devote the same attention to non-human consciousness as it now does to 
human consciousness, phenomenology can become a much more comprehensive 
arena for studies of consciousness and related phenomena. This will also make phe-
nomenologists more able to recognize similarities across species, and in turn what 
is truly genuinely human. As for engaging more fully with the empirical sciences, 
we support the ongoing attempts to naturalize phenomenology, which is an agenda 
that aligns well with the agenda for naturalizing semiotics. Such a development will 
make phenomenology an even more interesting resource for “soft” human sciences, 
for which it is already important. Additionally, such a further empirical turn would 
make phenomenology a valuable tool and resource for the natural sciences, particu-
larly biology, as well. This will also contribute to making phenomenology’s contri-
butions to our understanding of consciousness more accurate and informed. 
Concerning the third and last point, a semiotic contextualization of phenomenal 
experience will strengthen phenomenology by making for a more comprehensive 
outlook on and analysis of consciousness and related phenomena. By combining a 
more-than-human orientation with an empirical orientation and semiotic contextu-
alization, several new research paths will open up for the phenomenological move-
ment, and this broader outlook will also strengthen phenomenological findings and 
make these more credible.
The Umwelt theory of Jakob von Uexküll represents the most natural overlap-
ping theory of common interest to phenomenology and biosemiotics. It is at this 
stage worth recalling that the Umwelt theory in von Uexküll’s pioneering version 
has not only inspired modern phenomenologists, but was from the outset a biologi-
cal theory inspired by Kant’s notion of the ‘Erscheinungswelt’ (phenomenal world). 
By integrating phenomenology with biosemiotics, which is today the primary heir 
of von Uexküll’s mindset, in the new, common endeavor of agentology, the phe-
nomenological ideas that inspired von Uexküll in his biological work can become 
reunited, as it were, with modern phenomenology. At the same time, phenomenol-
ogy will in this way become informed by contemporary semiotic and empirical 
perspectives.
Biosemiotics, for its part, have some things to learn from phenomenology as 
well. In particular, phenomenological studies and observations should serve as a 
reminder about all the nuances that are to be found within the study of human con-
sciousness. Biosemioticians should not only be careful and attentive when making 
12  Agentology: Crosspollination of Science and Philosophy

343
distinctions between different lifeforms and species – which they typically are – but 
also be aware that in the case of human beings, our closest study object, several 
distinctions and nuances must be made for us to be able to paint an informative and 
accurate picture. Framed in semiotic terms, biosemioticians should acknowledge 
that anthroposemiosis (human semiosis) is a complex field of study. This is particu-
larly pertinent in the case of biosemiosis in human–animal and human–environment 
relations. While there is enormous variety on the animal end environmental side of 
such relations, there is also considerable variety and complexity on the human side. 
Just as phenomenologists should not neglect non-human consciousness, biosemioti-
cians should not neglect the great diversity in the forms that human consciousness 
can take. With thousands of different cultures and languages currently in existence, 
along with various categorizations of social groups and identities, biosemiotic stud-
ies of human–animal and human–environment relations must be case-specific and 
draw on relevant cultural, sociological and linguistic knowledge, complementary to 
biological and semiotic knowledge.
On a final note, Umwelt theory in von Uexküll’s classical version is underdevel-
oped in the context of human Umwelten. For one thing, he did not systematically 
investigate the implications for human Umwelt experience of the added linguistic 
dimension of the human Umwelt. If it is true that “language is not external to 
Umwelt, but internal to it”, and “changes the human Umwelt […] by fundamentally 
transforming it” (Tønnessen, 2015: 83), there is clearly work to be done in develop-
ing Umwelt theory further for proper application in human settings.6
12.3  Major Conclusions of the Book
	 1.	 A semiotic agent, which is a system capable of acting purposefully by selecting 
actions while making use of signs, is a distinct category of being with extended 
ontological status because of a feedback loop between the agent’s existence and 
purposes. Its being is both a result of past purposeful activity and a source of 
purposeful activity in the future. Such an interconnection of past and future 
through the purposeful being of an agent accounts for the temporal thickness of 
semiotic agents. Agents can be distinguished from the merely physical world by 
recognizing productive, regulatory, and epistemic relations: (i) with the excep-
tion of primordial agents, all agents are produced only by other agents, (ii) 
agents have the power to control some physical processes in their bodies and in 
the environment, and (iii) advanced agents develop internal models of the world.
	 2.	 The notion of semiotic agency overcomes Cartesian dualism. Firstly, agents 
vary in their complexity, ranging from simple functional mechanisms in living 
cells and human technology to complex organisms and even superorganisms. 
6 A step in this direction is taken in the development of a “tripartite model of the human Umwelt”, 
involving the core Umwelt, the mediated Umwelt, and the conceptual Umwelt of human beings 
(cf. Tønnessen, 2014).
12.3  Major Conclusions of the Book

344
Thus, there is a continuous scale of agential properties and capabilities, instead 
of a binary choice between rational agents and non-agents as in the Cartesian 
outlook. Secondly, complex agents are always multi-level: they construct, 
recruit, or grow subagents of lower complexity to help perform their functions, 
including the top-down regulatory functions. And thirdly, agents are embedded 
in their environments by way of embodied perception, functional circles, and 
niche construction. It is therefore not meaningful to understand the agential 
realm and the physical realm as having sharply defined boundaries.
	 3.	 Agents are of a semiotic nature because they use signs to regulate their func-
tions, communicate with others, or accumulate knowledge in the form of 
­heredity, memory, perception, representation, and cognition. A sign is a semi-
otic tool that (thanks to its form rather than matter or energy) prompts agents to 
perform functional activity. Sign processes, collectively known as semiosis, 
vary in their complexity and functions. Important forms of semiosis can be 
categorized as signification (whereby an agent associates a sign with meaning), 
representation and manipulation of signs (whereby an agent produces a sign to 
keep it in memory or to inform others), and communication (whereby agents 
use signs to exchange meanings with each other). The actions of agents are 
always sign-mediated, and draw on some form of experience, which is also 
sign-­mediated. Most often, action and experience should therefore be seen as a 
whole, as sign-mediated action-and-experience.
	 4.	 Although agents and signs are intricately related to each other in evolutionary 
and functional terms, they perform distinct roles: the role of signs is to signify, 
whereas the role of agents is to interpret signs and act. In a system hierarchy, 
agents are generally above signs, except in rare cases where agent-roles are not 
differentiated from sign-roles (e.g., at the origin of life). Signs can in effect 
change the activity of agents, but agents are ultimately in charge of sign rela-
tions, not the other way around.
	 5.	 Semiotic agents require autonomy, which presupposes a degree of indepen-
dence from the environment, and especially, by anticipation and being proac-
tive. Main aspects of autonomy include autopoiesis, self-governing, and 
semiotic freedom, which entail that agency is a self-producing mechanism, a 
self-controlling cybernetic system, and a semiotic system, respectively. Besides 
autonomy, agents require goal-directedness (i.e., teleology) by projecting their 
historically accumulated experiences to activities in the future. Teleology is not 
limited to agents capable of cognition, but applies to any organism, since all 
organisms pursue goals. Non-mental goals occur in eukaryotic organisms with 
innate behaviors and even in prokaryotes.
	 6.	 The first semiotic agents in evolutionary history were simple primordial sys-
tems (or proto-organisms) at the origin of life. In evolution, simple organisms 
became integrated into composite agents via reproduction without separation 
(integration of homogenous parts) and symbiosis (symbiogenesis). Examples 
of composite agents are eukaryotic cells, multicellular organisms, families, 
colonies, populations, and symbiotic consortia. The evolution of composite 
agents has progressed by specialization of subagents and the emergence of top-­
12  Agentology: Crosspollination of Science and Philosophy

345
down semiotic control. Simple agents and lower-level subagents are mecha-
nisms. Lower-level interpretations are always performed by mechanisms. 
However, the mechanistic approach is insufficient for studying complex agents, 
where mechanisms can be replaced without loss of functionality and the exact 
mechanism therefore does not matter. In light of this, we propose extending 
science beyond mechanisms into the domain of semiotic agency, but without 
abandoning the mechanistic approach where it works.
	 7.	 Phenomenal experience corresponds to organism-level semiosis, whereas 
lower-level semiosis is sub-phenomenal (somatic) and underpins the organ-
ism’s phenomenal experience. The organism uses phenomenal semiosis to 
engage with other organisms and its environment. Phenomenal semiosis com-
prises a phenomenal lifeworld (e.g. an Umwelt) for which the organism is the 
agent. Organism-level semiotic processes are subject-specific and involve vary-
ing grades of competence. While all organisms are subjective by being first-­
person wholes, some organisms (particularly sentient organisms) are more 
extensively subjective than others. The organism’s degree of subjectivity 
depends on the character and complexity of its semiotic organization.
	 8.	 Sign processes and relations (i.e., types of embodied and encoded sign pro-
cesses) are categorized into two basic levels: protosemiosis and eusemiosis. In 
protosemiosis, which is a rudimentary form of semiosis, signs are interpreted as 
actions, not as perceived objects. More advanced sign relations belong to euse-
miosis (i.e., full-fledged semiosis), where signs include references to objects, 
and are interpreted as being related to object categories. Eusemiosis is further 
partitioned into sublevels: a lower-level type supported by heritable habits, and 
a higher-level type that involves cognition and supports learning, acquired rep-
resentations of reality, and intentionality. Advanced forms of cognition are 
characterized by the use of symbols, reasoning, and language.
	 9.	 Semiogenesis is the emergence of new kinds of sign relations in agents. It can 
be either spontaneous or triggered by environmental change or internal distur-
bance, such as mutation, damage, or infection. New sign relations are estab-
lished as a result of the activities of agents via adaptive evolution, development, 
and behavior. Mutations are not primary causes of adaptive evolution, but some 
mutations are interpreted creatively by cells and/or their subagents based on 
their innate adaptive competence, and such interpretation may help an organism 
to survive and reproduce. Other adaptations emerge due to physiological and 
behavioral plasticity and are later stabilized by genetic accommodation. In cog-
nitive animals and humans, the major source of semiogenesis is the learning of 
new behaviors, concepts, and models of reality.
	10.	 Semiotic agency is not restricted to humans – it is a natural phenomenon that is 
found in all living organisms, organism parts, multi-organism autonomous 
units, and even in autonomous human artifacts. The specifically human form of 
semiotic agency stands out not by involving subjectivity, phenomena, and self-­
consciousness, as many philosophers think, but by being unusually complex, 
multifaceted, and adaptable. The world-altering abilities of the human species 
are not unique in principle. The current human dominance of global ecology is 
12.3  Major Conclusions of the Book

346
the empirical result of our species’ growing numbers and impact historically 
and anthropocentric priorities in our dealings with the environment. The human 
dominance has resulted in accelerating unsustainable change. This has caused a 
global environmental crisis which can now only be overcome by self-­consciously 
changing the way we make use of our semiotic agency and relate to the 
environment.
	11.	 Biosemiotics offers the most comprehensive theoretical platform for studying 
semiotic agency, and can serve as the main foundation for agentology, the gen-
eral study of agents and agency at all levels – from functional mechanisms to 
organisms and super-organisms. With its interdisciplinary and empirical 
­orientation, biosemiotics can help to integrate other approaches into agentol-
ogy. This includes information theory, constructivism, evolutionary epistemol-
ogy, enactivism, and phenomenology.

Glossary
Abiogenesis  The formation of living organism(s) from inorganic substances; the 
term is applied mostly to the origin of life.
Action  The goal-mediated activity of a semiotic agent.
Adaptive plasticity  Capacity of organisms to change their phenotypes and behav-
iors adaptively based on innate mechanisms in response to signals and distur-
bances (external and internal). Examples are habituation, sensitization, and 
phenotypic accommodation.
Agency  See: Agent; Semiotic agency.
Agent  A system with a capacity of acting purposefully by selecting actions with 
regard to signs. Agents are produced by parental agents for autonomous purpose-
ful activity.
Animal  A multicellular organism (kingdom Animalia) that feeds on organic mat-
ter. The stereotypical animal is endowed with sentience.
Animal welfare  The health, happiness and well-being of animals as reflected in 
their experience and typically related to fulfilment of animals’ needs.
Anthropocene  Term first coined by Paul Crutzen and Eugene Stoermer to desig-
nate the geological epoch of Earth that is predominated by anthropogenic envi-
ronmental changes.
Anthropocentrism  The belief that the species of Homo sapiens has achieved an 
incomparable level of perfection in evolution. This view implies human suprem-
acy and exceptionalism in environmental ethics.
Archaea (cf. archaebacteria)  One of the three domains introduced in the taxo-
nomic classification of all life onEarth by Carl Woese. Belongs to Prokaryotes; 
differs from Bacteria mostly by the composition of the cell membrane and 
enzymes involved in DNA replication.
ATP  Adenosine triphosphate, a coenzyme used as an energy carrier in the cells of 
all known organisms.

350
Autocatalytic set  A collection of entities (e.g., macromolecules), each of which 
can be created catalytically by other entities within the set, so that a whole set is 
able to catalyze its own production.
Autonomy  Self-sufficiency, self-government, and (relative) independence from the 
environment. See also: Autopoiesis; Semiotic freedom.
Autopoiesis  The capacity of a complex system to create and maintain itself. The 
term is applied to self-reproducing living systems.
Axon  Appendage of a neuron that transmits signals from the neuron body to mus-
cles or other neurons. Each neuron has a single axon that does not branch except 
for the very end of it.
Biosemiotics  An interdisciplinary approach that integrates theoretical biology 
with semiotics and supports biological grounding of semiosis. Subfields include 
ecosemiotics (the study of ecological semiosis) and zoosemiotics (the study of 
animal semiosis).
Calvin cycle  A circular metabolic pathway which is a light-independent compo-
nent of photosynthesis that allows carbon fixation from CO2 and produces pre-
cursors of sugar.
Catalyst  A material that speeds the kinetics of chemical reactions via structural 
features and is not consumed in the process. In a living organism, enzymes are 
proteins that act as catalysts.
Categorization  The action of placing an object into a category (class, type). Also: 
creating or managing categories of objects.
Cellular automata  A modeling platform realized as a grid of cells whose states 
evolve in discrete time steps according to a defined set of rules. The state of each 
cell depends on the states of the neighboring cells.
Centromere  Location of a chromosome used for attachment of microtubules dur-
ing cell division (mitosis); centromeres usually have no genes and include DNA 
repeats.
Chromatin  Complex of genomic DNA with scaffolding proteins (e.g., histones) in 
the nucleus of cells. Chromatin is needed mostly to fold (condense) and unfold 
DNA, prevent DNA damage, control gene expression, and for DNA replication.
Chromatin modification  Transformation of specific amino acids in histones by 
covalent attachment of various functional groups, such as methylation, phosphor-
ylation, acetylation, and ubiquitination. Chromatin modifications are molecular 
signs that are created by specific enzymes for regulating chromatin conformation 
(e.g., condensation versus release). Special protein sensors can detect histone 
modifications and recruit enzymes that make modifications in the adjacent frag-
ments of chromatin.
Classifier  An agent or subagent that assigns objects to one or multiple classes. See 
also: Categorization.
CLM  Coenzyme-like molecule.
Coenzyme  Catalytically active nonpolymeric molecule which often functions as 
an activator of proteins (enzymes). Examples of coenzymes are coenzyme A, 
ATP, NADH, flavin, and heme. Many coenzymes are known as vitamins.
Glossary

351
Coenzyme world  Hypothetical scenario of the origin of life that is focused on 
coenzyme-like molecules as primitive catalysts and hereditary agents that are 
assumed to be predecessors of nucleic acids and extant coenzymes.
Cognit  A spatially distributed network of cortical neurons that functions as a cog-
nitive subagent. According to the original definition by Fuster (2006), it is a unit 
of memory and knowledge.
Cognition  Mental competence of animals with a central nervous system that sup-
port consciousness and is characterized by representational memory, learning, 
imagination, emotion, and anticipation. Cognition implies conscious experience.
Complexity  Complexity relates to the manifold (non-simplistic) organization of 
something. In a biosemiotic understanding, the phenomenological (experience-
related) complexity of an organism tends to increase along with its biological 
(physiological) complexity.
Consciousness  Mental state of having awareness (representations) of something. 
Consciousness requires a central nervous system and supports proper subjective 
experience. See also: Self-consciousness.
Cooperation  A phenomenon which occurs when two (or more) agents work 
together in a way that is beneficial for both of them (or for the community of 
agents). Beneficial effects often include increased survival, reproduction, and 
persistence of identity and relations.
Culture  A culture is a way of life that is shared by a group of individuals, that char-
acterizes the group, and that is maintained by way of social regulation. Culture is 
a defining element of the identity of human individuals.
C-value paradox  Lack of correspondence between the total amount of DNA in a 
single cell (C-value) and the level of organism complexity.
Cybernetics  The science of communication and autonomous control in both mech-
anisms and living things.
Cytokines  Extracellular proteins and peptides that stimulate cell activities, includ-
ing cell division. Typical examples are growth factors that regulate embryo 
development, and interferon and interleukin that activate the immune system.
Cytoskeleton  A network of protein filaments and tubules in the cytoplasm of living 
cells, supporting their shape, movement, and integrity.
Darwinism  A theory developed by Charles Darwin that explains the evolution of 
organisms by descent with modification through variation and natural selection. 
Darwinism differs in kind from the modern synthesis (or neo-Darwinism) which 
is focused on changes in gene frequencies (unknown to Darwin) in a population 
over generations via natural selection.
Dendrites  Branching appendages of a neuron that receive signals from other neu-
rons via synapses and transfer signals to the neuron body.
Differentiation of cells  Differentiation is a transformation of cells towards special-
ization in certain functions, such as a muscle cell or a neuron. A fertilized egg is 
an undifferentiated totipotent cell that can differentiate during embryo develop-
ment to produce all cell types required in the adult organism.
DNA (deoxiribonucleic acid)  The DNA molecule encodes genetic information in 
living cells. It has a double-helix structure with two heteropolymers of nucleo-
Glossary

352
tides that are wound together. Each strand of the helix is a sequence of nucleo-
tides (connected via sugars), which play the role of letters from a short alphabet 
of four characters (A, T, G, and C). The second strand of DNA has a reverse-
complementary sequence to the first strand, so that A binds to T and C binds to G.
DNA repair  A collection of processes by which a cell identifies and corrects dam-
age to the DNA molecules that encode its genome.
DNA replication  When a cell divides, its genome, represented by one or several 
DNA molecules, needs to be copied so that two identical genomes are distributed 
between two daughter cells. The DNA double-helix is unwound by topoisomer-
ase and split into single strands by helicase. The DNA polymerase enzyme binds 
to the single-strand DNA and synthesizes a reverse-­complementary strand of 
DNA molecules from single deoxyribonucleotides.
Domains of life  The largest three evolutionary lineages of life (here referring 
to kinds of organisms) are represented by Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukaryotes. 
Bacteria and Archaea are often together considered as Prokaryotes because they 
have similar organization.
Ecological crisis  An ecology of Earth is in a state of crisis if current developments 
in relations within the web of species are not sustainable. From an objective 
point of view, the Anthropocene is equivalent to a state of global ecological crisis 
which is anthropogenic. See also: Environmental problem; Sustainability.
Ecology  The web of species in a certain environment. Also, a domain of biological 
sciences that studies interaction between organisms and the dynamics of popula-
tion numbers.
Economy  Commonly refers to the resource utilization and, in extension, value cre-
ation of the human species (cf. also Anthropocentrism).
Ecosemiotics  See: Biosemiotics.
Embryogenesis  Process in which an embryo emerges and grows from a single cell 
(fertilized egg) due to cell division and differentiation.
Emergence  Any phenomenon in which the interactions between entities or parts 
inside an entity allow for new properties that the individual entities or parts did 
not have, or could not perform.
Empathy  The capacity to feel or understand the perspective of someone else.
Environment  The physio-chemical, spatio-temporal surroundings of some organ-
ism. See also: Ecology; Umwelt.
Environmental crisis  See: Ecological crisis.
Environmental problem  A problem with the environment of a human being or 
some other organism, and the ecology of that environment, that makes it chal-
lenging, difficult or impossible for the organism to meet its needs.
Enzyme  A protein that acts as a catalyst.
Epigenetic factors  Internal factors of cells (e.g., gene activity/expression, protein 
interaction) or organisms that cannot be explained merely in terms of genetic 
encoding. Some epigenetic traits are passed down for a limited number of cell 
divisions and even generations.
Epigenetic heredity  Heredity that is not based on the DNA sequence. Epigenetic 
heredity is stored in DNA modifications (e.g., methylation) that do not alter the 
Glossary

353
sequence, chromatin modifications, protein structure, and membrane structure, 
which are preserved after cell division. Epigenetic heredity can be passed to 
the next generation of multicellular organisms, but it is less stable than genetic 
heredity.
Epoché  Term with origin in Antique Skeptical philosophy, implying taking a pause 
from making a judgement. In contemporary phenomenology, the epoché repre-
sents a methodical pause or suspension of judgement in the course of inquiry.
Ethics  Theorizing about moral matters (cf. morality). While some non-­humans too 
are endowed with morality, only human beings are capable of ethical reflection, 
i.e. of relating to moral matters in a theoretical fashion.
Eukaryotes  The evolutionary advanced domain of life which is characterized 
by large cells with a nucleus, chromosomes, endoplasmic reticulum, well-­
developed cytoskeleton, and mitochondria. It is assumed that mitochondria and 
chloroplasts (organelles in plant cells) originated from symbiotic (or parasitic) 
bacteria. The nucleus is enclosed inside a double membrane, which is called a 
nuclear envelope.
Eusemiosis  Interpretation of signs mediated by reference to an object or object 
type; presumably emerged in eukaryotic single-cell organisms.
Evolution of life  In biology, evolutionary theory assumes that various types of ani-
mals and plants have their origin in other preexisting types. Evolutionary theory 
also assumes that distinguishable differences between living organisms are due 
to modifications that occurred in previous generations. See: Darwinism.
Evolvability  The ability of a population of organisms to not merely generate heri-
table diversity, but to generate adaptive heritable diversity, and thereby acceler-
ate the development of adaptations through natural selection. Also concerns the 
degree to which a specific lineage can evolve.
Experience  The organism’s (first-person perspective) coherent “feeling” of what 
happens to it, momentarily. Experience involves the subject’s processing of 
external signs. By partaking in semiosis, all organisms have a degree of experi-
ence, though unlike proper subjects, quasi-subjects do not have proper subjective 
experience.
Existentialism  School of thought that emphasizes the existential circumstances of 
human beings. Primarily concerned with investigating matters of meaningful and 
authentic living, and revealing inauthentic, oppressive or absurd living condi-
tions. The implied research agenda is overlapping with that of phenomenology 
and hermeneutics.
Extended Evolutionary Synthesis  A revision of evolutionary theory that rejects 
the monopoly of the mechanistic paradigm (assumed in neo-­Darwinism) and 
emphasizes the role of organism agency. Phenotype, ­development, behavior, 
learning of organisms, and ecological interactions appear not less important 
in evolution than genes and mutations. This approach supports phenotypic and 
genetic accommodation, multilevel selection, increasing robustness and evolv-
ability, and the heritability of some somatic and behavioral variations via epigen-
etic heredity and niche construction.
Glossary

354
Extended ontological status  A distinct category of being based on a feedback loop 
between the agent’s existence and purposes. Its being is both a result of past pur-
poseful activity and also a source of purposeful activity in the future.
Function (biological)  Repeatable activity that is initiated by living agents for the 
purpose of achieving (or keeping) life-related goals. Functions are encoded in the 
memory and/or genome that is to be preserved over time.
Flagellum (pl. flagella)  Rotating thin protein appendage on the surface of bacteria 
(or archaea) used for locomotion and sensing.
Gene  In genetics: A unit of heredity, which determines or modifies the phenotype 
of organisms or cells and is transferred from a parent to offspring. In molecular 
biology: a distinct fragment of a chromosome and DNA sequence that is tran-
scribed in the form of mRNA or non-coding RNA. Most characterized genes are 
protein-coding, which means that the mRNA synthesized from the gene sequence 
by RNA-polymerase is then translated into the protein sequence by a ribosome.
Genome complexity  The total length of functional and nonredundant DNA 
sequences in a genome.
Goal  A sign that motivates or initiates agent activity. Goals either emerge within 
agents via development and learning, or get programmed by parental agents or 
higher-level agents.
Habit  The action of an organism, whose timing may depend on external or external 
signals, while the type of activity is programmed internally by hereditary factors 
or memory.
Heteropolymer  A polymer derived from two or more different types of monomers. 
Examples: proteins, nucleic acids.
Hermeneutics  Historically: the theory, or method, of interpretation. Initially 
applied only to key texts (e.g. biblical and judicial texts). In contemporary times: 
A humanities-centered tradition for interpreting and contextualizing meaningful 
phenomena.
Human agency  The characteristics of human agency develops through different 
life stages. At a mature stage, human agency has some unique features due to 
human beings’ involvement in a culture, use of language, and advanced form of 
self-consciousness, among other factors.
Human being  Individual belonging to the human species (Homo sapiens).
Human–animal assemblage  A human–animal assemblage is a human and an ani-
mal with intimate association and highly coordinated behavior. Such an assem-
blage represents a special case of a human–animal complex.
Human–animal complex  Any complex (functional unit) of humans and animals 
for which human agency plays a significant role for the coming to be and main-
tenance of the complex.
Human–animal relation  Any firmly established (engrained, routine or habitual) 
or more fluid relation between humans and animals. Behavioral patterns that 
maintain human–animal relations are influenced by humans’ ideas about and 
understanding of the animals, and by animals’ response to and experience with 
human behavior.
Glossary

355
Human ecology  The segment of ecology at large that involves the human being 
and where human agency therefore plays a role. As a result of the semiotic cau-
sation that is governed by humans, and the dominating role of human agency in 
the current epoch of the Anthropocene, human ecology currently accounts for a 
substantial part of ecology at large.
Hylozoism  The philosophical view that all things in the world are in some 
sense alive.
Individual  A subject with individual traits (i.e. traits that distinguishes it from 
other singular organisms). Like subjectivity, individuality comes in degrees.
Information  Data or message that can be interpreted. Sensu Claude Shannon, it 
refers to the level of uncertainty of a message. In biosemiotics: a sign or set of 
signs (together with their sign relations) that are interpreted by agents for initia-
tion and regulation of their functions. Example: genetic information.
Intentionality  The capacity of cognitive animals to generate mental states that rep-
resent external things and associate them with pursued goals.
Interpretant  The result of interpretation of a sign; e.g., mental change, action, 
or result of action. In Peirce’s semiotics, the interpretant is related to the object 
of a sign.
Intuition  Spontaneous or unguided thinking. Moral theory often refers to our 
moral intuitions, our “sense of what is right”.
Judgement  Thoughtful, reflective reasoning involving evaluation of evidence 
related to some decision that is to be made.
Language  A specifically human system of communication and symbolic represen-
tation, that comes in thousands of versions.
Learning  Development and storage of non-innate interpretation mechanisms, 
which generally require representational cognition. Learning is opposed to adap-
tive plasticity, which is based on an innate program.
Life  Life generally refers to living organisms (e.g., animals, plants, fungi, protists, 
bacteria), which are self-reproducing systems with self-sustained metabolism, 
heredity, and regulation. In the context of the origin of life, life refers to sim-
pler autonomous systems, including viruses, that may have been predecessors 
of organisms.
Lifeworld  Originally coined by Edmund Husserl, the Lifeworld (Lebenswelt) con-
stitutes the “lived experience” of a human or non-human. All phenomena appear 
in (individual or collective) Lifeworlds. See also: Umwelt.
Lipid world  Scenario of the origin of life that is focused on lipid-like molecules as 
predecessors of cell membranes and carriers of heredity.
LUCA  The last universal common ancestor (LUCA) is a hypothetical common 
ancestor of all living organisms on Earth. The genome of LUCA is a reconstruc-
tion based on stochastic mathematical models.
Macroevolution  Long-term evolutionary changes that take millions of years and 
include qualitative changes such as the emergence of new species and higher-
level taxons.
Measurement error model  Regression models that account for measurement 
errors in independent variables.
Glossary

356
Memory  Traces of past experience that can be accessed by an agent and is used for 
constructing future activities.
Microevolution  Short-term evolutionary changes that can be traced in natural or 
laboratory populations. These changes are mostly quantitative and can be char-
acterized by the frequency of certain alleles.
The Modern Synthesis  See: Neo-Darwinism.
Mind  Minimal mind is eusemiosis. Advanced mind includes subjective experi-
ence. All conscious organisms, i.e. organisms with a central nervous system, are 
endowed with mind.
Mitosis  Cell division in eukaryotes, which includes resorption of nuclear mem-
brane, duplication of chromosomes, their condensation, pairing, and equal distri-
bution between daughter cells.
Moore’s law  An empirical trend in the development of computer technology which 
states that the number of transistors per chip increases exponentially, doubling 
approximately every 12–18 months.
Morality  A sense of what is right or wrong in terms of certain evaluative, standard-
setting moral norms and values. All moral agents (i.e. beings capable of act-
ing morally) are endowed with morality. Most humans and some animals have 
(degrees of) morality. In evolutionary terms, morality is a further development 
of social normativity.
mRNA  Messenger RNA is a single-strand RNA sequence, which is a copy of a 
DNA coding sequence of an individual gene. mRNA is synthesized directly on 
the single-strand DNA template by RNA-polymerase enzyme, and this process 
is called transcription.
Natural selection  Differential survival and reproduction of individuals due to dif-
ferences in their heritable phenotypic traits.
Naturalized Phenomenology  A form of phenomenology that is consistent with, 
and informed by, facts from empirical sciences.
Needs  Any organism has needs that have to be met for it to survive and thrive. 
These include needs related to nutrition, reproduction, and a suitable habitat; 
some organisms further have a number of social and other needs.
Neo-Darwinism (cf. Modern Synthesis)  A theory that integrated Darwin’s ideas 
of evolution of organisms by descent with modification through variation and 
natural selection with population genetics. It is based on mathematical models 
that predict changes of gene frequencies in populations over time via natural 
selection.
Neurons  Cells specialized in transferring electrical signals in the nervous systems 
of animals.
Object  Something that appears to, or is related to, a subject (typically: some-
thing that is observed by a subject). Objects in a subject’s Umwelt are called 
“Umwelt objects”. In Peirce’s semiotics, objects are interrelated with signs and 
interpretants.
Organic molecules  Complex molecules which contain carbon and are typically 
used for the construction of organisms’ bodies.
Glossary

357
Organism  A fundamental autonomous functional unit of life that is typically 
capable of reproduction. Includes single-cells (prokaryotes and unicellular 
eukaryotes) and multicellular animals, plants, and fungi. Some organisms (e.g., 
parasites) have limited autonomy.
Origin of life  Concerns how life emerged in an initially abiotic world. This is dis-
cussed either as a general issue (i.e., how life emerged in the universe), or as 
a more limited issue in the context of Earth history (i.e., how life appeared on 
Earth). See also: abiogenesis.
Panpsychism  The philosophical view that all things in the world have a mind or a 
mind-like quality.
Panspermia  Theory stating that life or the chemical precursor of life had an extra-
terrestrial origin and was transported to a suitable environment (such as Earth) on 
a space body (comet, asteroid or planet) or by some other means.
Perception  Organization, identification, and interpretation of sensory information 
by organisms or other agents. Categorical perception translates sensorial input 
into categories of objects or signs (e.g., words).
Perceptual image  Mental state that integrates sensorial data related to an object 
of interest.
Phenomenon  A phenomenon is something that appears to someone in their experi-
ence. Arguably, all phenomena are underpinned by semiosis.
Phenomenology  The study of phenomena in human and non-human experi-
ence. Contemporary phenomenology was established by Edmund Husserl (ca. 
1900). Phenomenological studies can focus e.g. on how objects/phenomena 
or Lifeworlds/Umwelten are constituted, what is characteristic for someone’s 
experience, or how different phenomenal beings interact. See also: Naturalized 
Phenomenology.
Pilus (pl. pili)  A thin protein appendage on the surface of bacteria (or archaea) 
used for attaching to surfaces, sensing, and immune protection.
Plant  A multicellular eukaryotic organism (kingdom Plantae) that uses photosyn-
thesis to make organic molecules (carbohydrates) from CO2. The typical plants 
include trees, grasses, ferns, moss, and multicellular algae (sea weeds).
Polymerization  Process where monomer molecules become connected covalently 
or via specific binding and form linear polymer chains or three-­dimensional 
networks.
Polypeptide  Linear chain of amino acid monomers linked by peptide (amide) 
bonds, forming a protein molecule or a part of it. A polypeptide can be folded 
and modified in a cell to make a 3-dimensional functional protein.
Primary agents  Agents capable of self-reproduction (often with some help from 
other agents), such as organisms, cells, mitochondria, chromosomes.
Prokaryote  Small single-cell organisms without a membrane-bound nucleus, 
mitochondria, and other membrane-bound organelles. Prokaryotes include two 
domains: Bacteria and Archaea. In contrast, cells with nuclei and organelles are 
placed in the domain Eukaryota.
Protosemiosis  Interpretation of signs (signals) by simple agents (e.g., ribosome or 
bacteria) as actions without any reference to objects.
Glossary

358
Replication  Making a copy of another object or sign. When applied to hetero-
polymer molecules (e.g., DNA), it means template-based replication, where each 
monomer is, first, paired with a complementary monomer, and then become 
attached to the end of the polymer which is a result of replication.
Ribosome  Organelle of all living cells formed by two subunits of RNA molecules 
integrated with specific proteins, which had evolved for a programmed synthesis 
of polypeptides (which then become proteins). Ribosome binds to messenger 
RNA (mRNA) which serves as a program that determines the order of amino 
acids in the synthesized polypeptide.
RNA world  Hypothetical stage of primordial evolution representing cells with 
heredity based on self-replicating RNA molecules, which were not capable of 
programmed peptide synthesis via the genetic code. The RNA world was ini-
tially seen as the first step at the origin of life, but later it has been considered as 
an intermediate step.
Routine semiosis  A sign process (e.g., interpretation) that is mostly habitual; it 
also can be accidental (non-intentional), or extrapolative.
Search image  Mental state that is used as a template for filtering incoming senso-
rial data (i.e., perceptual images, sounds, smells) and finding potentially match-
ing objects.
Secondary agents  Agents not capable of self-reproduction, such as ribosomes, 
proteins, and human autonomous artifacts.
Self-consciousness  A form of consciousness that is self-reflective and enables self-
conscious humans and non-humans to relate consciously to themselves, thus 
enhancing their semiotic agency by way of an advanced form of intentionality.
Semiogenesis  The generation of new or modified sign relations by agents via evo-
lution, development, and learning. It is opposed to routine semiosis.
Semiosis  The use of signs by agents, such as in signification, representation, and 
communication.
Semiotic agency  The capacity of acting purposefully and using signs to make 
informed choices. All organisms are endowed with semiotic agency. Other semi-
otic agents include autonomous cell subagents, cells, organs, populations, eco-
logical consortia, families, communities, cultures, humanity, and autonomous 
artifacts.
Semiotic agent  An agent endowed with semiotic agency.
Semiotic causation  Term coined by Jesper Hoffmeyer to designate the causal 
power and impact of interpretative, semiotic agents as reflected in how they 
affect the organization of physio-chemical reality. Semiotic causation supple-
ments efficient causation without contradicting it.
Semiotic freedom  The capacity of agents for spontaneous and non-­deterministic 
semiotic activity, such as choosing signs (for interpretation) and goals, as well as 
creative interpretation of signs.
Semiotics  The study of signs. Semiotic studies may apply a processual (emphasiz-
ing sign processes) or systemic perspective (emphasizing sign relation and sign 
systems), etc.
Glossary

359
Sensing  The conversion of external signs (e.g., signal molecules, photons, oscilla-
tions of air) into internal signs (signaling proteins, neural signal) by an agent or 
subagent.
Sentience  The capacity for sensing and feeling in organisms endowed with 
consciousness.
Sign  Semiotic tool that prompts an agent, thanks to its form rather than matter or 
energy, to perform some activity, which tends to be beneficial for it. Agents use 
signs to perceive the environment, regulate their activities, communicate with 
others, and accumulate knowledge. In Peirce’s semiotics, a sign is a triadic rela-
tion between a sign vehicle (representamen), object, and interpretant. ‘Sign’ 
often means ‘sign vehicle’.
Sign process  A process of sign interpretation by an agent or subagent. It is a mate-
rial process with specific space-time constraints. Its result (an interpretant) can 
be a resource, tool, sign vehicle, or agent.
Sign relation  A type of sign process that is embodied and encoded by an agent (or 
type of agents). In Peirce’s semiotics, the sign relation dynamically intercon-
nects a sign vehicle (representamen), object, and interpretant.
Sign vehicle  Something that stands for something else for agency. In Peirce’s semi-
otics, it is representamen.
Signal  Evolutionary primitive sign that is directly involved in perception-­action (or 
sensing-action) coupling. In protosemiosis, all signs are signals.
Social regulation  Social regulation occurs among individuals in species that form 
cooperative societies and involves adaptation of behaviour influenced by pre-
dominant social norms and expectations. Human agency involves a high degree 
of social regulation e.g. in the context of ethics (moral ­regulation), economy 
(regulation of resource utilization and value creation), and law (formalized nor-
mative regulation).
Subagent  A subagent is an agent that helps a higher-level agent to pursue or fulfil 
a purpose. Subagents are often physically included in the body of a higher-level 
agent (e.g., cells in the body of animals and plants).
Subject  An organism (or other agent) that is capable of (centered, unified) experi-
ence, and thus has a coherent subjective outlook. See also: semiotic agency.
Subjectivity  The feature of being subject-like. Comes in degrees, ranging from 
proper subjects (with centered, unified experience) such as most animals to 
quasi-subjects (with fragmented or distributed experience) such as plants and 
fungi. Subjectivity also refers to subject-specific semiotic processes, which can 
be studied by science.
Sustainability  Sustainability concerns meeting the present needs of humans and 
non-humans without compromising the ability of future generations of humans 
or non-humans to meet their needs.
Symbiogenesis  An evolutionary theory based on the assumption that the cohabi-
tation and cooperation of unrelated organisms may result in the emergence of 
a larger organism type with the original organisms as subagents. In particular, 
eukaryotic cells presumably originated from a symbiosis of prokaryotic cells.
Glossary

360
Symbiosis  Interaction between different organisms or populations that associate 
with each other physically, typically to the advantage of both.
Symbol  In linguistics and cultural studies: a sign of an abstract idea or form, logi-
cally connected to other abstract ideas or forms. In Peirce’s semiotics: a sign 
whose meaning is established by convention or habit.
Taxonomic group (taxon)  Group of organisms linked by evolutionary relations 
(e.g., common origin) and overall similarity, which is seen by taxonomists to 
form a unit of various rank such as a species, family, or class.
Teleology  In biosemiotics: goal-directedness (purposefulness) in the function of all 
agents. In the humanities: human or divine intention.
Telomere  The end of a chromosome that contains specific satellite DNA repeats. 
The function of telomeres is to maintain the integrity of a chromosome and pre-
vent its shortening during cell division.
Template-based replication  See: Replication.
Transposon  Repetitive DNA originating from parasitic viruses that often have a 
capacity to make additional copies of themselves in other genome locations.
tRNA  Transport RNA which is used to bring amino acids to ribosomes and to 
control protein synthesis. tRNA carries anticodon site (3 nucleotides) that deter-
mines the specificity of the genetic code, i.e., matching to triplet nucleotides 
in mRNA.
Umwelt  Means ’environment‘ or ’surroundings‘ in German (literally: ‘surrounding 
world’). Jakob von Uexküll used this term for a model of the ­self-­centered world 
of an organism, which includes all the meaningful objects in aspects that are 
associated with the organism’s functions. See also: Lifeworld.
Wildlife  Collective name for wild animals, plants and other organisms. In the 
Anthropocene, wildlife is typically marginalized due to the practically pervasive 
role of human agency.
Wildlife management  The public management of wildlife, aiming to achieve con-
servation goals and/or optimal resource utilization.
Zoosemiotics  See: Biosemiotics.
