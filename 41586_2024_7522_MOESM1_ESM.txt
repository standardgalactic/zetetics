SI-1. Six reasons why many find the hypothesis that language mediates thought—the hy-
pothesis that we argue against in our piece—appealing. 
 
1) The desire for biological discontinuity between humans and other animals. 
The idea that language mediates thought (i.e., that language endowed humans with a new repre-
sentational format) more straightforwardly allows for a potential discontinuity between non-hu-
man animals and humans. 
 
2) The desire for a one-factor explanation of differences between humans and non-human an-
imals. 
The hypothesis that language gave rise to our ability to think is more parsimonious than the hy-
pothesis whereby language and thinking independently increased in their sophistication over the 
course of human evolution. 
 
3) The inner speech phenomenon. 
Many have a sensation of a voice in their heads when they think—what is often referred to as in-
ner speech (Fernyhough & Borghi, 2023). Attempts to systematically assess the presence of in-
ner speech have revealed that the phenomenon is not universal: a substantial fraction of the pop-
ulation does not experience this phenomenon (Roebuck & Lupyan, 2020) and even those who 
do, only report engaging in inner speech some of the time (Heavey & Hurlburt, 2008; Alderson-
Day & Fernyhough, 2015). This evidence already rules out a strong version of the idea that inner 
speech is critically necessary for thinking. However, given that for many, engaging in inner 
speech appears to be a common experience, this phenomenon deserves further investigation. 
 
4) The intuition that linguistic explanations crystallize thinking. 
Explaining (teaching) an idea to someone, including casting it in a linguistic format, can help 
crystallize the idea, sharpen the argumentation, and lead to an increased level of understanding 
(Lombrozo, 2006). Whether linguistic formulation specifically is critical to these effects remains 
unclear, but even if it is, such effects are unlikely to be mediated by the core language-processing 
mechanisms that support lexical access and syntactic structure building—the mechanisms dis-
cussed in ‘The language network in the human brain’ of this piece. In particular, this intuition 
applies to argument chains, which connect information across a relatively long, multi-sentence 
timescale. However, the language network is relatively insensitive to information at this time-
scale. In particular, the language areas are characterized by a relatively short ‘temporal receptive 
window’ (Hasson et al., 2008), only integrating information across the span of up to ~10 words 
(Pallier et al., 2011; Shain, Kean et al., 2024), and do not show sensitivity to discourse-level 
structure (Lerner et al., 2011; Blank & Fedorenko, 2020; see Fedorenko et al., 2024 for a re-
view). Nevertheless, these effects deserve more scientific attention. The mechanisms discussed 
in Cantlon & Piantadosi (2024) could play a role here. 
 
5) The intuition that speaking a particular language (e.g., German or Mandarin) is associated 
with different ways of thinking. 
The idea that the language you speak affects how you think, often referred to as the Sapir-Whorf 
hypothesis or the Whorfian hypothesis (Casasanto, 2012; Whorf, 1956/2012), has received a lot 
of attention in the last few decades (e.g., Majid et al., 2004; Casasanto, 2008; Lupyan, 2012; 
Dolscheid et al., 2013). Empirically, the approach typically involves comparing speakers of 

3 
different languages, where the languages differ in whether they have words for a particular con-
cept or whether they mark a particular grammatical distinction, and performance of these differ-
ent groups is examined on some cognitive task where the distinction is relevant, to test whether 
access to a certain linguistic representation is associated with better performance. Unfortunately, 
many experimental findings from this line of work do not appear to be robust to replication (e.g., 
i) Boroditsky, 2001 – failures to replicate: Chen, 2007; January & Kako, 2007; Tse & Altarriba, 
2008; ii) Boroditsky et al., 2003 – failure to replicate: Mickan et al., 2014; iii) Winawer et al., 
2007 – failures to replicate: Martinovic et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2023). 
 
Furthermore, some conceptual confusion exists in the literature about the relationship between 
language and culture, and about the directionality of the putative cross-linguistic differences. In 
particular, culture unquestionably shapes cognition, making certain aspects of the world more 
salient (e.g., Pitt et al., 2022). These cross-cultural differences are, of course, reflected in lan-
guage given that we use language to convey the contents of our minds. For example, a culture 
that has no utility for numbers/counting is not going to invent words for exact numbers (e.g., 
Frank et al., 2008) and a culture that does not have artifacts that only differ in color may not have 
many color terms (e.g., Gibson et al., 2017). However, cultural demands shaping cognition (and, 
correspondingly, language) is quite different from the hypothesis that speakers of different lan-
guages will think fundamentally differently because of some feature of their language, even if 
cultural considerations are identical. 
 
6) The term “language of thought (LOT)”. 
One popular hypothesis about the representational format of thoughts is called a “language of 
thought” (Fodor, 1975). The core idea is that thoughts are built out of smaller atomic pieces, just 
like programs are built out of a small collection of operations, or sentences are built out of 
words. Fodor in particular argued that such a compositional, rule-based system would be re-
quired to explain the compositionality of our thinking, as well as the systematic patterns of rea-
soning that we engage in. Modern versions of this theory have found empirical support across 
many domains (Goodman et al., 2008; Piantadosi et al., 2012; Piantadosi et al., 2016; Amalric et 
al., 2017; Rule et al., 2020; Dehaene et al., 2022; Sablé-Meyer et al., 2022; Yang & Piantadosi, 
2022; Ellis et al., 2023). However, although some have argued that natural language is the lan-
guage of thought (e.g., Chomsky, 1965), the evidence reviewed in the main text does not support 
this possibility. Instead, it appears that we possess a language of thought—or, more likely, multi-
ple languages of thought (see Mandelbaum et al., 2022 for a recent discussion)—that are linked 
to, but separable from, our linguistic abilities. In fact, this is how most current computational im-
plementations are structured, where the representational systems hypothesized for the language 
of thought are distinct from the types of systems that are thought to underlie natural language.

SI-2. Select quotes about the role of language in thinking and cognition (relevant to Box 1). 
 
Chomsky (in Piatelli-Palmorini, 1980): 
• “ … language is so deeply involved in many aspects of thinking… a substantial part of 
what we call thinking is simply linguistic manipulation, so if there is a severe deficit of 
language there will be severe deficit of thought” 
• “ … thinking is a domain that is quite different from language, even though language is 
used for the expression of thought, and for a good deal of thinking we really need the 
mediation of language” 
 
Carruthers (2002): 
• “ … natural language syntax … is crucially necessary for inter-modular integration… 
non-domain specific thinking operates by accessing and manipulating the 
representations of the language faculty” 
 
Gleitman & Papafragou (2012): 
• “ … several credible lines of experimental and developmental evidence suggest 
significant influence of linguistic representation during on-line processing in many 
cognitive and perceptual domains: Insofar as languages differ in the short-term 
processing demands that they pose to listeners, interpretational outcomes and styles, 
including characteristic ambiguity resolution, may look quite different cross-
linguistically…” 
 
Gentner (2016):  
• “ … language serves as a cognitive tool kit that allows us to represent and reason in 
ways that would be impossible without such a symbol system” 
 
Lupyan (2016):  
• “ …The unique design features of language such as its categorical and discrete format 
allow it to augment basic cognitive and perceptual processes.  … Normal human 
cognition is language-augmented cognition.”
