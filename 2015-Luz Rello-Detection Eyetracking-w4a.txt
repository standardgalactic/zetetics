ABSTRACT 
Worldwide, around 10% of the population has dyslexia, a 
speciﬁc learning disorder. Most of previous eye tracking ex­
periments with people with and without dyslexia have found 
diﬀerences between populations suggesting that eye move­
ments reﬂect the diﬃculties of individuals with dyslexia. In 
this paper, we present the ﬁrst statistical model to predict 
readers with and without dyslexia using eye tracking mea­
sures. The model is trained and evaluated in a 10-fold cross 
experiment with a dataset composed of 1,135 readings of 
people with and without dyslexia that were recorded with 
an eye tracker. Our model, based on a Support Vector Ma­
chine binary classiﬁer, reaches 80.18% accuracy using the 
most informative features. To the best of our knowledge, 
this is the ﬁrst time that eye tracking measures are used to 
predict automatically readers with dyslexia using machine 
learning.

1. INTRODUCTION 
Dyslexia is the most common neurological learning dis­
ability [24]. It aﬀects from 10 to 17.5% of the population in 
the U.S.A. [23] and from 8.6 to 11% in Spain [6, 25] and has 
a considerable presence in web text [1]. Competitive reading 
and writing is required in our education system; therefore 
school failure is associated with dyslexia, even if dyslexia is 
not related to overall intelligence [24].

Dyslexia detection is crucial. When diagnosed, dyslexia 
can be treated avoiding its consequences such as high rates 
of academic failure. At the same time, diagnosing dyslexia is 
not a trivial task; it is expensive and it normally requires an 
expert. Also, dyslexia manifestations vary depending on the 
language. In fact, dyslexia is called a hidden disability due 
to the diﬃculty of its diagnosis in languages with shallow 
orthographies [72], as Spanish. 
Previous eye tracking studies with people with dyslexia 
from psychology research have concluded that the eye move­
ments of people with dyslexia are not the cause but the re­
ﬂection of the diﬃculties they have while reading [21, 45, 49]. 
Although there are number of studies that presents how eye 
tracking measures show individual diﬀerences [12, 37, 40], 
most of the studies agree in ﬁnding signiﬁcant diﬀerences 
among readers with and without dyslexia. 
Human-computer interaction studies that use eye tracking 
with people with dyslexia have normally focused in ﬁnding 
the most accessible text presentations [55, 57]. Again, diﬀer­
ences between people with and without dyslexia were found. 
Even if eye tracking measures have already been used to 
predict where people tend to look [26] or to improve the 
interface design of search engines [17], among others; we 
believe this is the ﬁrst eﬀort to automatically detect dyslexia 
using eye tracking measures. 
In this paper we present a statistical model to classify 
readers with and without dyslexia using a Support Vec­
tor Machine binary classiﬁer. We trained the model with 
a dataset composed of 1,135 readings of Spanish speakers 
with and without dyslexia from 11 to 54 years old recorded 
with an eye tracker. 
The contribution of this paper is: 
–  a statistical model to classify Spanish readers with and 
without dyslexia that achieves 80.18% accuracy in a 
10-fold cross validation experiment.1 
Next section focuses on dyslexia and its detection. Section 
3 explains related work that have shown diﬀerences between 
populations using eye tracking. We present the dataset used 
in Section 4 and show the experiments with our statistical 
model in Section 5. We discussed the results in Section 6. 
Finally, we draw conclusions and future work in Section 7.

2. DYSLEXIA DETECTION 
Dyslexia is deﬁned as a speciﬁc learning disability with 
neurological origin. It is characterized by diﬃculties with 
accurate and/or ﬂuent word recognition and by poor spelling 
and decoding abilities. These diﬃculties typically result as 
a deﬁcit in the phonological component of language that is 
often unexpected in relation to other cognitive abilities. Sec­
ondary consequences may include problems in reading com­
prehension and reduced reading experience that can impede 
growth of vocabulary and background knowledge [24, 30]. 
Dyslexia detection is crucial since academic failure is as­
sociated with dyslexia when it is not detected and treated 
accordingly [14]. Diagnosing dyslexia and early detection 
of risk of dyslexia have been addressed from diﬀerent ﬁelds, 
especially in psychology and neuroimaging. 
In psychology, traditional paper based diagnosed of 
dyslexia such as TALE [70] for Spanish or Diagnostischer 
Rechtschreibtest [18] for German, analyze both reading and 
writing skills. Diagnoses of dyslexia are conﬁrmed when the 
reading and the spelling performance of the child is signif­
icantly under the level expected due to her or his age and 
general intelligence.2 
More recently, Lyytinen et al. [32] created the computer 
game Literate, later called GraphoGame [31],3 which was de­
veloped to identify children at risk of having dyslexia before 
school age in Finland. Its exercises are aimed towards the 
connection of graphemes (letters) and phonemes (sounds). 
They conducted two user studies with 12 and 41 children 
between 6 and 7 years old with very promising results. Al­
though these exercises were conceived as preventive train­
ing, children who used Literate improved their accuracy in 
grapheme-phoneme connections, reading words, and naming 
phonemes after playing for less than 4 hours. 
On the other hand, neuroimaging with children with 
dyslexia has revealed relationships between brain responses 
at infancy and later reading performance. Molfese [36] re­
ported that there are brain responses (event-related brain 
potentials) to speech sounds within 36 hours of birth that 
can be used to discriminate children who would become 
readers with dyslexia with 8 years old. The accuracy of 
this prediction is 81%. 
3. EYE MOVEMENTS AND DYSLEXIA 
Related work on diagnose and early detection of risk of 
dyslexia is very extensive and comes from diﬀerent ﬁelds 
such as cognitive neuroscience, psychology or biology. In 
this related work we only focus on how eye tracking mea­
sures have been studied in relationship with dyslexia. These 
studies come from psychology and human-computer interac­
tion research. 
3.1 Psychology Research 
Rayner [50] presents a review of the studies from the mid 
70’s to the 90’s that have used eye movements to investigate 
cognitive processes. He demonstrates that eye movement 
measures can be used to infer moment-to-moment cognitive 
processes in reading. For instance, shorter ﬁxations are as­
sociated with better readability while longer ﬁxations can 
2Other causes, like insuﬃcient vision and hearing ability, 
brain injury or lack of opportunity to learn, have to be ex­
cluded ﬁrst [10]. 
3https://graphogame.com/ 
indicate that processing loads are greater. As a matter of 
fact, non impaired readers present longer ﬁxations at low-
frequency words than at high-frequency words [22, 27, 46, 
51, 54, 59]. 
The eye movements of readers with dyslexia are diﬀer­
ent from regular readers. 
People with dyslexia as well 
as beginner readers, make longer ﬁxations, more ﬁxations, 
shorter saccades4 and more regressions than readers without 
dyslexia [11, 35, 50]. 
During the 80’s-90’s it was discussed to which extent eye 
movements are the cause of reading problems. If eye move­
ments were a causative factor, then dyslexia could easily be 
diagnosed with a simple eye movement test. There have 
been some studies concerning whether eye movements are 
the cause of dyslexia: erratic eye movements [41, 42, 43], in­
stability during ﬁxation [11], and selective attentional deﬁcit 
[13, 15, 44]. However, the results presented in those exper­
iments could not be later replicated by others (see [3, 5, 
38, 39, 65, 66] for erratic eye movements; Raymond et al. 
[47] for instability during ﬁxation; and [16, 28, 52, 53, 64] 
for selective attentional deﬁcit). At the same time, Tinker 
[67, 68] and Rayner [48, 50] studies show how eye move­
ments are generally not a cause of the reading disability but 
were a reﬂection of other underlying problems. More con­
cretely, there are three studies that are consistent with the 
conclusion that eye movements reﬂect the diﬃculties that 
individuals with dyslexia have while reading and that are 
not the cause of the reading problem. 
First, Hy¨ona and Olson [21] found that readers with 
dyslexia show the typical word frequency eﬀect in which 
low-frequency words are ﬁxated longer (ﬁxation duration, 
number of ﬁxations, and regressions) than high-frequency 
words. 
Second, Pirozzolo and Rayner [45] and Olson et al. [39] 
found that when people with dyslexia were given a text ap­
propriate for their reading level, their eye movements (ﬁx­
ations, saccades, and regressions) were much like those of 
regular readers at that particular age level. 
Third, Rayner [49] showed that regular children’s eye 
movements (ﬁxation durations, saccade lengths, and the size 
of the perceptual span) shared the characteristics of read­
ers with dyslexia when they were given a text that was too 
diﬃcult for them. 
Taking into account all these studies the evidence sug­
gests that the vast majority of people with dyslexia have a 
language processing deﬁcit and, that their eye movements 
simply reﬂect their diﬃculty processing language [50]. 
Later literature on eye tracking and dyslexia have focused 
on the eﬀect of other factors, such as regular orthogra­
phy [20], orthographic neighbors [33], or letter length and 
phoneme length [34]. 
3.2 Human-Computer Interaction 
In her PhD thesis, Rello [55], performed twelve eye track­
ing experiments –and eleven sub experiments– to explore the 
impact of text presentation and text content on the readabil­
ity and comprehension of people with dyslexia. 
The text presentation parameters tested were typeface, 
font size, colors, character spacing, line spacing, paragraph 
spacing, diﬀerent grey scales for text, and column width [61]. 
On the other hand, the text context parameters were word 
frequency and word length [59], diﬀerent kind of numerical

representations [60], verbal paraphrases, graphical schemes, 
keywords, and diﬀerent strategies of lexical simpliﬁcation 
[58]. Each experiment had between 23 to 48 participants 
with dyslexia plus a control group. In all the experiments, 
except from one –where the participants had to read texts 
with orthographic errors [56]– there were found signiﬁcant 
diﬀerences between participants with and without dyslexia 
regarding eye tracking measures. 
3.3 What is missing? 
Previous literature on eye movements and dyslexia have 
found pattens, correlations, individual diﬀerences, and sig­
niﬁcant diﬀerences between populations. However, to the 
best of our knowledge, none of them have applied machine 
learning to classify people with and without dyslexia, that 
is, to detect readers with dyslexia. 
What is missing is the connection of two points that were 
not previously joined: eye tracking measures and machine 
learning techniques to predict readers with dyslexia auto­
matically. 
4. DATASET 
We used a dataset derived from an eye tracking experi­
ment with 97 subjects with normal or corrected-to-normal 
vision; 48 of then with diagnosed dyslexia. The participants 
with dyslexia (22 female, 26 male) presented a conﬁrmed 
diagnosis of dyslexia. Their ages ranged from 11 to 50 (¯x 
= 20.96, s = 9.98). Except from 3 participants, all of the 
participants were attending school or high school (26 partic­
ipants), or they were studying or had already ﬁnished uni­
versity degrees (19 participants). The group of participants 
without dyslexia was composed of 49 people (28 female, 21 
male). Their ages ranged from 11 to 54 (¯x = 29.30, s = 9.03). 
Except from 5 participants, the rest were either attending 
or had ﬁnished school or high school (17 participants) or 
university (27 participants). 
This dataset was derived from a within-subject design ex­
periment. Each participant read 12 diﬀerent texts with 12 
diﬀerent typefaces. The texts and the fonts were counter­
balanced to avoid sequence eﬀects. Therefore, the data with 
respect to text-font combinations was evenly distributed. 
The twelve fonts were: Arial, Arial Italic, Times and 
Times Italic – the most common fonts used on screen 
and printed texts, respectively [8]–; OpenDyslexic and 
OpenDyslexic Italic – designed speciﬁcally for people with 
dyslexia–5; Verdana, recommended by the British Dyslexia 
Association [4]; Courier – the most common example of 
monospaced font [8]–; Helvetica and Myriad – broadly used 
in graphic design and typeface of choice of Microsoft and 
Apple, respectively –; Garamond – for its strong legibility 
for printed materials [8]– and CMU –widely used in scien­
tiﬁc publishing, as is the default of the typesetting program 
TeX, as well as a free typeface supporting many languages 
[29]. 
The readings of each text were recorded using eye track­
ing, the user preferences towards the fonts were gathered 
using questionnaires with ﬁve-point Likert scales. Compre­
hension questions were presented at the end of each text as 
a control variable. 
5http://opendyslexic.org/ In this typeface the letters are more 
diﬀerentiated compared to regular fonts. For example, the shape 
of the letter ‘b’ is not a mirror image of ‘d’. 
The text used in the experiments met comparability re­
quirements. They were extracted from the same book, Im­
postores (‘Impostors’), 6 by Lucas S´anchez [62]. They all had 
the same genre and same style; the same number of words 
(60 words); similar word length, with an average length 
ranging from 4.92 to 5.87 letters; absence of numerical ex­
pressions, acronyms, and foreign words, because people with 
dyslexia especially encounter problems with such words [9]. 
An example of a text read by the participants is given in the 
Appendix. 
The text presentation was also controlled, except from 
the typeface. All the texts were left-justiﬁed, using a 14 
points font size, and the column width did not exceeded 70 
characters/column, as recommended by the British Dyslexia 
Association [4]. The color used was the most frequently used 
in the Web for text: black text on white background. 
The equipment used was the eye tracker Tobii 1750 [69], 
which has a 17-inch TFT monitor with a resolution of 
1,024×768 pixels. The time measurements of the eye tracker 
have a precision of 0.02 seconds. Hence, all time values are 
presented in the dataset with an accuracy of two decimals. 
The eye tracker was calibrated individually for each partic­
ipant and the light focus was always in the same position. 
The distance between the participant and the eye tracker 
was constant (approximately 60 cm. or 24 in.) and con­
trolled by using a ﬁxed chair. 
For more details about the experimental design on how 
these readings were collected, please refer to [55]. 
Therefore, our dataset is composed of readings marked 
as D if the participant has dyslexia and N if not, there are 
12 readings per participant, that is 1,164 readings; 29 of 
these readings were not properly recorded with not a number 
values. Hence, we removed those readings from the dataset 
having a ﬁnal dataset containing 1,135 readings. From the 
dataset we extracted the following features: 
–  Age of the participant: ranging from 11 to 54 years 
old. 
– Typeface: One of the 12 typefaces used for the text. 
–  Italic: This is a binary feature with two values, italic 
when the text had an italic type and roman when the 
text had a roman type. 
–  Serif: This is a binary feature with two values, sans 
serif when the font of the text had an typeface with­
out serif -Arial, Helvetica, Myriad, and Verdana–, and 
serif when the text had typefaces with serif –CMU, 
Garamond, and Times–. 
–  Typeface designed for dyslexia: A binary feature 
that shows when the font in the text had a typeface 
speciﬁcally designed for people with dyslexia. 
–  Typeface preference of the participant: Value 
given to a typeface by the participant using a ﬁve-
point Likert scale. 
–  Number of visits: Total number of visits to the area 
of interest. 
–  Mean of visit: Duration of each individual visit 
within the area of interest (the text). 
6http://www.impostores.es/#/Impostores 

–  Sum of visits (in the following, reading time): 
Sum of all the visits. This is equivalent to the reading 
time of the whole text. 
–  Mean of ﬁxation: When reading a text, the eye does 
not move contiguously over text, but alternates sac­
cades and visual ﬁxations, that is, jumps in short steps 
and rests over pieces of text. It denotes how long the 
eye rests still on a single spot of the text. 
–  Number of ﬁxations: Total number of ﬁxations 
while reading a text per visit. 
– Sum of ﬁxations: Sum of all ﬁxations. 
Some of the features have numeric (real or integer) values, 
so we established some ranges for each of them to discretize 
the data. For instance, the age of the participants is divided 
in 3 diﬀerent groups: (1) younger than 14 years old, (2) from 
14 to 19 years old, and (3) from 20 to 54 years old. 
5. EXPERIMENTS 
In order to ﬁnd out whether it is feasible to detect read­
ings of users with dyslexia, we set up a machine learning ex­
periment. Machine learning is the scientiﬁc discipline that 
studies algorithms that can learn from data and make pre­
dictions. The output of a machine learning algorithm is 
called a model which is capable of making predictions given 
unseen data (normally for evaluation). 
We carried out an experiment with a binary classiﬁer 
of LIBSVM [7] in the polynomial Support Vector Machine 
(SVM) set-up. An SVM is a method for supervised learning 
that analyzes data and recognize patterns for classiﬁcation. 
Given a set of training examples, each marked as belonging 
to a category, an SVM training algorithm builds a model 
that assigns new examples into the categories. It represents 
the examples as points in space and classiﬁes them accord­
ing to hyperplanes. When there is an input for the classiﬁer 
it tries to assign a hyperplane to the input and then this is 
the classiﬁcation output. Our SVM is trained on datasets 
as the one described in Section 4, and it is able to perform 
predictions on new readings. 
We performed a 10-fold cross validation experiment by di­
viding the data in 10 diﬀerent roughly equal subsets (10% 
of the data in each subset). Then we trained a statistical 
model on the rest of the data (90%) and tested on the cor­
responding fold by iterating 10 times, at the end we had all 
the data tested independently. We randomized the data and 
we did stratiﬁed sampling to ensure a similar distribution of 
data in all folds. We also kept all readings by the same user 
in the same fold, meaning that we had, in each fold, a similar 
number of readings marked as participants with and without 
dyslexia, and that a user does not serve for training a model 
that will predict readings of the same user. The idea is to see 
how the results of the statistical analysis will generalize on 
an independent dataset, in our case: new readings. We used 
10-fold cross validation because it is normally recommended 
for smaller datasets when a single train-development test 
split might not be informative enough [2]. 
Table 1 shows the accuracy of the SVM models for each 
of the folds. This result suggests that the model is able 
to predict readings of users with dyslexia quite accurately 
with a ﬁnal result of 80.18% by using the most informative

features (reading time, mean of ﬁxations and age of the par­
ticipants),7 meaning that the statistical models are able to 
make a correct prediction in 910 of the 1,135 readings. 
The features that we found useful for classiﬁcation were: 
(1) reading time, (2) mean of ﬁxations, and (3) age of the 
participant. Some features that were useful standing alone, 
such as (1) number of visits or (2) number of ﬁxations were 
not useful when they are used jointly with the features listed 
above, due to redundancy as they express very similar infor­
mation. Other features, such as typeface, italic or serif do 
not aﬀect at all in the predictions, which is also expected, 
and good news, because they are independent from the par­
ticipant. This means that we are able of detecting users 
with dyslexia without taking into account the typeface. 
6. DISCUSSION 
First, it is worth noting that the age of the participants 
range from 11 to 54 years old, and the users with dyslexia 
tend to improve their reading skills with age. In order to 
test whether this was aﬀecting the ﬁnal result we run the 
same experiment (with the same folds), as in Section 5, by 
removing the age of the participant as a feature. Table 2 
shows the results of the SVM models without considering 
the age of the participants. The ﬁnal result is 76.38 of ﬁnal 
accuracy (losing 3.8 points). This indicates that the age of 
the users shows clearer diﬀerences in their reading perfor­
mance. Nonetheless, in the dataset, the age average of the 
participants with dyslexia is 20.96, with a standard devia­
tion of 9.98 while the age average of the participants without 
dyslexia is 29.20 with a standard deviation of 9.03 [55]. If the 
ages of both groups were perfectly matched, we could expect 
to have more homogenous results between folds. Nonethe­
less, we had more participants without dyslexia without 
higher education (5) than participants with dyslexia (3) [55]. 
Fleshing out a bit more the results, we also observe that 
some folds achieved higher results than others, being 96.26% 
the highest and 61.21% the lowest, even though we per­
formed stratiﬁed sampling we encountered this outcome. 
This means that some of the readings are diﬃcult to pre­
dict. For instance, a participant with dyslexia who is 50 
7It is worth noting that we did not perform an in-depth fea­
ture selection experiment; we just tested the features one by 
one and in combination and we tested the same conﬁgura­
tion for all the folds, but we plan to perform more experi­
ments in this direction. However, we would need a bigger 
dataset to do so.

years old and might have already overcome most of its read­
ing issues, would be ideally classiﬁed as a participant with 
dyslexia, however our model fails and classiﬁes it as a partic­
ipant without dyslexia. We believe that the main problem is 
the size of the dataset, since having more input data would 
lead our model to generalize better in those cases. There­
fore, in order to improve our results, we plan to increase 
the dataset by carrying out more eye tracking experiments. 
Moreover, the age of the participants is also playing a role in 
this issue, since we have participants that range from 11 to 
54 years old, we also believe that having diﬀerent datasets 
depending on the age of the participants will also lead to a 
proper classiﬁcation of the readings, since our model is gen­
eral and a ﬁrst attempt trying to predict dyslexia based on 
eye tracking measures. 
As we mention above, the features related with the type­
face were not useful for classiﬁcation. Even that previous 
work has shown that typeface have a signiﬁcant impact on 
the readability of people with and without dyslexia, this 
fact does not have an impact to diﬀerentiate their readings. 
The fonts that improve the readability of people without 
dyslexia are also beneﬁcial for the readability of people with 
dyslexia [55]. This can explain why typeface is not an infor­
mative feature for classiﬁcation, similarly of the font related 
features, such as, serif, italic, and fonts designed for people 
with dyslexia. 
Even if the results of this experiment are only valid for 
Spanish language, previous literature on eye tracking has 
found signiﬁcant diﬀerences on eye movements for languages 
with deeper orthographies such as English [21], German [20] 
or Bulgarian [19] as well as it was reported for Spanish [35]. 
Therefore we believe that dyslexia prediction in other lan­
guages using eye tracking measures is feasible, especially in 
languages with shallow orthographies where reading speed 
is a strong indicator for diagnosing dyslexia, such as Spanish 
[63] or Italian [71]. 
7. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK 
The eye movements of readers with dyslexia are diﬀerent 
from regular readers. People with dyslexia have longer read­
ing times, make longer ﬁxations, and make more ﬁxations 
than readers without dyslexia. In this paper we have shown 
how these characteristics can be used to train a machine 
learning model. 
We have presented a method that predicts readings of 
people with dyslexia with 80.18% of accuracy. To the best of 
our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst attempt to build a statistical 
model to predict automatically readers with dyslexia using 
eye tracking measures. The model uses common eye tracking 
features such as reading time, mean of ﬁxation, as well as 
the age of the participant. However, note that these are 
only seminal results on this topic and that the dataset was 
intended for other purposes. 
Dyslexia is called a hidden disability because it is hard 
to diagnose. Diagnosing dyslexia is crucial to address this 
condition but estimations of dyslexia are much higher than 
the actual diagnosed population. Our model is just the ﬁrst 
attempt on predicting dyslexia by using a machine learning 
approach with eye tracking measures. However, we believe 
it has a great potential impact. 
This study suggests that eye tracking measures have the 
potential to be used to diagnose dyslexia in the future. Eye 
trackers are becoming more and more aﬀordable and reading 
a text in silence is less intrusive than being exposed to the 
tests needed in current diagnoses. Moreover, there are other 
human-computer interaction measures that were found to be 
related to eye tracking measures, such as mouse tracking, 
that are yet to be explored. Their potential applications go 
from diagnosing to user modelling via their interaction with 
the computer. 
For future work we plan to enlarge the dataset by carry­
ing out more eye tracking experiments in diﬀerent languages. 
Then, we also plan to try with other kind of classiﬁers, such 
as perceptron learning, recursive neural networks, or con­
ditional random ﬁelds. Currently, we are exploring other 
human-computer interaction measures to detect dyslexia in 
collaboration with schools.
