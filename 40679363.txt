 ABSTRACT
 It is shown that ß, the initial postmaximum rate of SN brightness decline (in the B band) d
 by Pskovskii, may have a smaller dispersion among S Ne Ia in elliptical galaxies than in a
 types of galaxies. Contamination of the sample by S Ne Ib is unlikely to be the primary cause
 difference. Although the number of objects is very small, it is also possible that the velocity 
 ejecta in elliptical galaxies is lower than in spiral galaxies. If correct, these observations provid
 first direct evidence for physical differences among SNe la in different environments; redde
 variations due to gas and dust are unlikely to produce most of the observed dispersion in ß am
 spirals. One obvious possibility is that the SNe la in spiral galaxies come from intermedia
 stars and that differences in the metallicities, accretion rates, or other properties account for
 observations. A more extreme, improbable explanation is that not all SNe la in spiral galaxies r
 from carbon deflagrations of carbon-oxygen white dwarfs.
 Key words: photometry-supernovae-white dwarfs
 1. Introduction
 One of the most notable characteristics of Type la
 supernovae (SNe la) is that the blue light curves of differ-
 ent objects, as well as their optical spectra at a given
 phase, are all very similar, at least during the first few
 months past maximum brightness. This is understood in
 terms of the standard model of SNe la (e.g. , Woosley and
 Weaver 1986), in which a carbon-oxygen (C-O) white
 dwarf in a binary system is demolished by a carbon defla-
 gration wave once the mass of the star reaches the Chan-
 drasekhar limit. The early time light curves of most
 SNe Ib, a spectroscopically distinct subclass, also appear
 to be similar to those of SNe la (Porter and Filippenko
 1987; Ensman and Woosley 1988).
 It has long been suspected, on the other hand, that the
 light curves of SNe I do exhibit some heterogeneity. Bar-
 bon, Ciatti, and Rosino (1973; see also Barbon, Cappaci-
 oli, and Ciatti 1975), for example, divided SNe I into
 "fast" and "slow" subclasses, depending on properties of
 the light curve within 1-2 months of maximum bright-
 ness. (Note that the spectroscopic distinction between
 SNe la and SNe Ib had not yet been recognized, but
 these are unlikely to correspond to the "fast" and "slow"
 photometric subclasses (Porter and Filippenko 1987).) A
 more quantitative scheme was proposed by Pskovskii
 (1984, and references therein; hereafter referred to as
 P84). He defined the parameter ß to be the mean rate of
 brightness decline in the B band (expressed as magni-
 tudes per 100-day interval) from maximum light to the
 well-known "elbow" in the light curve. Although Doggett
 and Branch (1985) did not include the possibility of sys-
 tematic differences when constructing their "average"
 SN I light curve, several studies (Pskovskii 1977; P84;
 Branch 1981) had previously claimed that ß is correlated
 with other physical properties of SNe I, such as peak
 absolute magnitude and expansion velocity.
 The early reluctance to accept the photometric hetero-
 geneity of SNe I (e.g., Sandage and Tammann 1982) was
 due to the rather scanty nature of the available evidence,
 to conflicting statements in the literature, and to the
 possibility of substantial observational errors. Recently,
 however, conclusive photometric and spectroscopic dif-
 ferences have been found among several SNe la.
 SN 1986G in Centaurus A, for example, declined much
 more rapidly than most SNe la at optical wavelengths
 (Phillips et al. 1987), and its infrared light curve was also
 different (Frogel et al. 1987). Moreover, the measured
 expansion velocity of its photosphere decreased more
 rapidly than that of the well-observed SN Ia 1981B.
 Schneider et al. (1987) show that SN 1987D in UGC 7370
 also had a lower expansion velocity than SN 198 IB at a
 comparable phase, and some of its absorption troughs
 were deeper than those in SN 1981B. SN 1984A in
 NGC 4419, on the other hand, had higher expansion
 velocities than SN 1981B (Branch 1987). A careful study
 by Branch, Drucker, and Jeffery (1988) provides solid
 evidence against the suggestion, made by Pearce, Col-
 gate, and Petschek (1988), that this apparent discrepancy

 between SN 1984A and SN 1981B is due to errors in the
 assumed epochs of maximum brightness. Indeed, many
 S Ne Ia exhibit different photospheric expansion veloc-
 ities at a given phase (Branch et al. 1988). From a theoret-
 ical point of view, this is not unexpected; Woosley (1989)
 argues that the flame speed in the carbon deflagration
 should vary among S Ne la, with several observable con-
 sequences.
 It is of great interest to see whether the noted differ-
 ences among S Ne Ia are linked in any way with the stellar
 populations in which they occur. A definite correlation
 might imply, for example, that the properties of the pro-
 genitor are affected by the environment, or that more
 than one type of progenitor is involved. The relative
 dearth of high-quality data precludes a detailed study at
 this time, but here I discuss some preliminary compari-
 sons between ß and galaxy T types (de Vaucouleurs, de
 Vaucouleurs, and Corwin 1976; hereafter referred to as
 RC2). They suggest a smaller degree of heterogeneity
 among S Ne Ia in elliptical galaxies than in spiral galaxies.
 2. The Sample
 I use as my sample the list of SNe I in Table 1 of P84,
 with a few modifications described below. According to
 Branch (1986), spectra are not available for 15 of the 48
 objects. Unless Pskovskii used unpublished or unknown
 (to Branch) spectra, they were presumably classified as
 SNe I by the shape of their light curves. It is now gener-
 ally acknowledged (e.g. , Oke and Searle 1974) that such a
 procedure is risky, so these objects should be considered
 as SN I "candidates". No known SNe Ib are in the list
 (Porter and Filippenko 1987; Branch 1986), but it is im-
 possible to distinguish between the la and Ib subtypes
 from the existing spectra of nine of the SNe. A few
 SNe Ib, and even one or two misclassified SNe II, may
 contaminate the sample, though this is unlikely to affect
 my conclusions. If the 24 SNe lacking firm la classification
 are excluded from the analysis, the number of objects
 becomes rather small (24), with only three objects in
 elliptical galaxies. For the time being I treat all 48 SNe as
 SNe la, but in the future it will be important to develop a
 better sample. Near the end of Section 3, I briefly com-
 pare the average ß of six SNe in elliptical galaxies (all
 presumed to be SNe la, since no other subtype has ever
 definitely been seen in ellipticals) with that of the 21
 confirmed SNe la in spiral galaxies.
 Values of ß for all objects were determined by P84 in a
 uniform manner. A special effort was made to improve the
 ß estimates over those published in the first extensive list
 (Pskovskii 1977). All photographic measurements were
 transformed to blue (B band) magnitudes, and uncertain-
 ties were assigned to each ß.
 Despite the care put into the derivations of these ß
 values, it is hard to believe that the quoted uncertainties,
 many of which are only 0.1-0.2 mag, are realistic. To
 illustrate this, I discuss SN 1976G in NGC 488, for which
 P84 lists ß = 8.6 ± 0.1 mag (100 d)"1. The only data
 available, published by Wegner (1979), show that the
 decline is defined entirely by a single measurement (not
 made by Wegner) at the bright end and a tightly spaced
 cluster of measurements (made by Wegner) at the faint
 end. There is absolutely no guarantee that the true light
 curve followed the line defined by the two endpoints; but
 even if there were, an error of only 0. 1 mag in the single
 bright endpoint translates into a difference of 0.4 mag
 (100 d)"1 in ß! Furthermore, it is not even certain that the
 object was a SN la, since no spectrum was obtained.
 SN 1976G is, admittedly, an extreme example, but it
 strongly suggests that the ß values, and especially their
 quoted uncertainties, should be viewed with due caution.
 In fact, the uncertainties are not used in my analysis.
 Before proceeding, a few modifications to the P84 data
 set are necessary. SN 1975S (Wegner 1977) is excluded
 because its light curve suggests a Type II classification.
 SNe 1895B, 19651, and 1972E are also rejected; their
 parent galaxies (10 = non- Magellanic irregular), although
 classified as T = 0, probably deserve a large physical T
 type because they have much younger stellar populations
 than true early type (T = 0) SO/a galaxies. SN 1962P is
 excluded because its parent galaxy (NGC 1654) does not
 have a sufficiently reliable classification. SN 1954A in
 NGC 4214, which Branch (1986) classified as a "peculiar"
 SN I, also deserves special attention. Its spectrum ex-
 hibits strong absorption lines of helium (McLaughlin
 1963; Branch 1972), suggesting that it is a helium-rich
 SN Ib (Harkness et al. 1987) as opposed to a helium-poor
 SN Ib (Wheeler et al. 1987). Although Porter and Filip-
 penko (1987) did not include SN 1954A in their list of
 definite or very probable SNe Ib, their paper was written
 before the existence of helium variations among SNe Ib
 was fully appreciated. SN 1954A should now be consid-
 ered as a nearly certain SN Ib; in any case, it is unlikely to
 be a SN la, so it is removed from the sample. As men-
 tioned above, 48 confirmed or candidate SNe la remain in
 the list.
 The T type of each galaxy is taken from RC2. The only
 exception is NGC 1316 (SN 1980N), for which RC2 claims
 T = -2; the work of Schweizer (1981) shows that the
 object is a cD galaxy, so T = -4 is more appropriate. It is
 worth pointing out that for spiral and lenticular galaxies,
 there are quite a few discrepancies between galaxy T
 types given in RC2 and the corresponding Hubble types
 (Sandage and Tammann 1987) or DDO types (Maza and
 van den Bergh 1976). This does not affect my conclusions,
 however, since few (or zero) ellipticals seem to have been
 misclassified as galaxies of later type. Moreover, it was
 found that the data set is not sufficiently large to search for
 significant differences between various subclasses of spi-

 rais. For homogeneity, therefore, I use RC2 in a
 except the one mentioned above.
 3. Distribution of ß Values
 Figure 1 shows a plot of SN ß versus the T type of
 parent galaxy. Despite the small number (7) of S
 elliptical galaxies (T = -6 through -4), the ß value
 except one are in a tight cluster. The single high
 crepant object, SN 1939B in NGC 4621, has ß = 
 This has the largest uncertainty assigned to any
 P84, but casual inspection of the data (Minkowsk
 shows that the brightness decline is undeniably
 steep. According to P84, no other SN I comes cl
 having such a high ß; SN 19631 in NGC 4178 is th
 ner-up, with ß = 13.5 ± 0.3. The rapid declin
 SN 1939B may have been caused by a helium deto
 (Nomoto 1982; Woosley, Taam, and Weaver 1986) 
 than by the usual carbon deflagration, but in this c
 should have been spectroscopically distinct from or
 S Ne Ia and Ib. To my knowledge no spectrum o
 available. Since SN 1939B deviates so greatly from
 SNe la in elliptical galaxies, I exclude it from fu
 consideration.
 The six remaining SNe la in elliptical galaxies (the "E
 subsample") have a median ß of 8. 45 and a mean of 8. 62 ±
 0.96. By comparison, the 41 other SNe, almost all of
 which have T > 1 (i.e., Hubble type Sa or later; the "S
 subsample"), have a median ß of 8.40 and a mean of 8.50
 ± 2.02. The medians and means of these subsamples are
 almost indistinguishable, but the dispersions differ by
 more than a factor of two. Unfortunately, the E subsam-
 ple is so small that the difference does not necessarily
 indicate that the two subsamples are drawn from two
 distinct populations; nevertheless, the probability is suffi-
 ciently high to be intriguing. The nonparametric Siegel-
 Tukey test (e.g., Neave and Worthington 1988), for exam-
 ple, shows that the dispersion of the S subsample is larger
 than that of the E subsample at roughly the 30% signifi-
 cance (i.e., 70% confidence) level. Is this the first hint of a
 physical difference between SNe la in elliptical and spiral
 galaxies? A much larger sample of objects should be used
 to confirm and strengthen the result.
 From Figure 1 it is clear that galaxies having some small
 range of T types do not dominate the ß dispersion among
 SNe la in the S subsample. Formally, it is instructive to
 divide the S subsample into three roughly equal groups.
 SNe in galaxies with T = -3 through 3 (SO through Sb; N
 = 13) have median ß = 8.60, (ß) = 8.52 ± 2.23; those
 with T = 4 - 5 (Sbc, Sc; N = 15) have median ß = 8.70,
 <ß> - 8.59 ± 1.81; and those with T = 6 - 10 (Scd

 for SN 1939B (T = 5), SNe I in elliptical galaxies appear to have a smaller range of ß values than those in other types of galaxies. This is also the case
 when one considers only the confirmed SNe la.

 region (if one is present).
 4. Discussion
 The data presented above reveal that most SNe la in
 elliptical galaxies grow dimmer at nearly the same rate, at
 least at blue wavelengths. (Note that we have very little
 information about the bolometric light curves of SNe.)
 The scatter in decline rates among SNe la in spiral galax-
 ies, on the other hand, is larger, although only at the 70%
 (or smaller) confidence level. Moreover, there is marginal
 evidence that SNe la in elliptical galaxies typically have
 lower expansion velocities than those in spirals. Finally,
 as mentioned by Filippenko (1988), perusal of many re-
 cent spectra of SNe la gives the impression that SNe la
 occurring near arms and H il regions in spiral galaxies
 exhibit greater variations (at a given phase) than those in
 ellipticals. The data, together with a more complete dis-
 cussion, will be given in a future paper.
 A number of factors may contribute to the observed
 scatter of ß in the S subsample. As already mentioned, it
 is possible that a few SNe Ib (or even SNe II) contaminate
 the S subsample of presumed SNe la; the same analysis
 done with the 21 confirmed SNe la gave a smaller disper-
 sion for ß. Another point that must be considered is
 extinction, since Leibundgut (1988) has recently shown
 that ß increases with increasing EB_V. Although the range
 of extinction suffered by SNe la in spiral galaxies is un-
 doubtedly greater than that in elliptical galaxies, making
 this effect potentially important, I don't believe it ac-
 counts for most of the observed ß dispersion in the S
 subsample. To make ß go from 9.2 to 10.6 mag (100 d
 for example, EB_V must increase from 0.0 to 1.0 mag
 change in visual extinction of over 3 mag. Since most
 the SNe la used in my analysis were located in the ou
 regions of spiral galaxies, the typical extinction was prob
 bly not so high. Furthermore, the ß dispersion in th
 subsample was caused as much by small values of ß as by
 large values of ß, yet the mean ß was equal to that of the
 subsample. This suggests extinction was not the dominan
 factor.
 Metallicity differences between spiral and elliptical
 galaxies might also be invoked to explain the difference in
 dispersions, but it is not certain that they would lead to
 sufficiently large variations in the physical state of the
 white-dwarf progenitors. As explained by Woosley
 (1989), in some carbon deflagration models the effective
 flame speed has a slight inverse dependence on the car-
 bon abundance, and this affects the bolometric light
 curve. Another possible metallicity effect is the cooling of
 the carbon convective core during the initial stages of the
 runaway by the convective URCA process (Woosley and
 Weaver 1986; Nomoto 1989); higher metallicity results in
 the production of more nuclei having atomic mass 22 and
 23, and these are the principal cooling agents. It is not yet
 clear, however, how this modifies the light curve.
 A very attractive hypothesis, possibly related to metal-
 licity differences, is that the progenitors of SNe la can be
 relatively young (intermediate mass), as well as old (low
 mass), with the explosions of young progenitors showing
 greater heterogeneity than those of old progenitors.
 Bertola and Sussi (1965) were the first to propose that
 SNe I may have two different types of progenitors. This
 idea was further developed in a systematic way by Dalla-
 porta (1973). The specific evidence for a young stellar
 population is that SNe I in spiral galaxies generally appear
 in the disks rather than the halos. More importantly,
 many SNe I appear superposed on, or very close to, spiral
 arms of galaxies (e.g., Johnson and MacLeod 1963; Van
 Dyk 1986). The latter statement conflicts with Maza and
 van den Bergh (1976), who conclude that SNe I are not
 associated with spiral arms and therefore arise primarily
 in old populations. Several excellent examples of SNe I in
 the vicinity of spiral arms (e.g., SN 1975O, SN 1975P,
 SN 1986A) are illustrated by Ciatti and Rosino (1978) and
 by Dekker, D'Odorico, and Arsenault (1988), but of
 course some of these may simply be chance superposi-
 tions. Additional observations are needed to resolve the
 problem.
 Following the early studies, Oemler and Tinsley (1979)
 argued convincingly that a majority of SNe I come from
 short-lived stars, even if those in elliptical galaxies are
 produced by very old stars. The basic evidence is that (a)
 SNe I are very common in non- Magellanic irregular (10)
 galaxies such as NGC 5253, which are characterized by an

 5. Conclusions
 Very marginal evidence has been found that SNe la in
 elliptical galaxies are more photometrically homogeneous
 (in the B band) than those in other types of galaxies. Major
 differences in stellar populations could produce the ob-
 served dispersion among the decline rates of SNe la in
 spiral galaxies. If so, certain changes may be required in
 our models of SNe and stellar evolution. These questions
 should be pursued with vigor until they are resolved. It is
 imperative, of course, to confirm and quantify the obser-
 vational variations among SNe la; high-quality light
 curves and spectra should, therefore, be obtained of as
 many SNe la as possible in all types of galaxies. A pho-
 tograph of each galaxy, showing the SN, must also be
 taken in order to study the environments of SNe. Eventu-
 ally, a narrow-band Ha image should also be obtained, to
 show the distribution of H il regions near the position of
 theSN. With modern, multifiber spectrographs, it will be
 feasible to make detailed studies of the immediate envi-
 ronments of SNe and of many H II regions in their parent
 galaxies.
 The work reported here was done while I was a visiting
 astronomer at the Royal Greenwich Observatory; it is a
 pleasure to thank Elena and Roberto Terlevich for their
 warm hospitality and for many useful conversations. An
 interesting discussion with Sidney van den Bergh at the
 Elizabeth and Frederick White Research Conference on
 Supernova 1987A (Canberra, Australia, June 1988) pro-
 vided part of the motivation for this study. Useful com-
 ments on a preliminary version of this paper were pro-
 vided by D. Branch, J. C. Shields, and S. E. Woosley. My
