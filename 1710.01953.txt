Abstract
The double copy is a much-studied relationship between scattering amplitudes in gauge and
gravity theories, that has subsequently been extended to classical ﬁeld solutions.
In nearly
all previous examples, the graviton ﬁeld is deﬁned around Minkowski space. Recently, it has
been suggested that one may set up a double copy for gravitons deﬁned around a non-trivial
background. We investigate this idea from the point of view of the classical double copy. First,
we use Kerr-Schild spacetimes to construct graviton solutions in curved space, as double copies
of gauge ﬁelds on non-zero gauge backgrounds. Next, we ﬁnd that we can reinterpret such cases
in terms of a graviton on a non-Minkowski background, whose single copy is a gauge ﬁeld in the
same background spacetime. The latter type of double copy persists even when the background
is not of Kerr-Schild form, and we provide examples involving conformally ﬂat metrics. Our
results will be useful in extending the remit of the double copy, including to possible cosmological
applications.

Introduction
The structure of gauge and gravity theories, and the relationships between them, continue to be the
subjects of active research. An important example of such a relationship is the double copy [1–3],
which states that perturbative scattering amplitudes in gravity theories both with and without su-
persymmetry can be obtained from their counterparts in a non-abelian gauge theory by exchanging
the couplings, and also replacing colour information with kinematic information in a prescribed
way. This relies on a certain colour-kinematics interplay – BCJ duality – being possible in the
gauge theory [1]. Both BCJ duality and the double copy are proven at tree-level [3–11], where
the latter is equivalent to the known KLT relations [12] between gauge and gravity amplitudes,
that arise from string theory. At loop level these properties remain conjectural, although highly

non-trivial evidence exists at multiloop level in a variety of theories [2,13–34]. All-order evidence is
possible in certain special kinematic limits [35–42], and other related studies can be found in [43–67].
It remains unclear whether or not the double copy is an accident of perturbative scattering am-
plitudes, or represents a much deeper relationship between gauge, gravity and related theories. A
number of recent studies have therefore looked at whether or not other quantities can be matched
up and, if so, whether the relevant relationship is related to the double copy for amplitudes. Refer-
ence [68] considered a family of exact classical solutions in gravity, stationary Kerr-Schild metrics,
and found that these could indeed be single-copied to Yang-Mills theory. Well-known gravitational
objects such as the Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes emerge as special cases. The Kerr-Schild
framework can also be generalised to include (time-dependent) plane waves, and known properties
of amplitudes in the self-dual sector of Yang-Mills theory and gravity [10]. The case of an arbi-
trarily accelerating particle was considered in ref. [69]. This also has a Kerr-Schild form, which
has the eﬀect of forcing the radiation to appear as a source term on the right-hand side of the
Yang-Mills and Einstein equations. This source term could be related to known amplitudes for the
Bremsstrahlung of photon and graviton radiation, thus more tightly establishing the link between
the classical and amplitude double copies.
Reference [70] went beyond the simple Kerr-Schild form used in ref. [10], in considering the Taub-
NUT solution. This has a double Kerr-Schild form, yet nevertheless can be single copied to a gauge
theory dyon, whose magnetic monopole charge maps to the NUT charge in the gravity theory.
Furthermore, ref. [70] already hinted at the possibility of constructing a double copy around a non-
trivial background metric (namely the de Sitter metric), and we will return to this in what follows.
Further work relating to the classical double copy has investigated whether or not the source terms
in the ﬁeld equations are physically meaningful [71], and whether the copy can be extended to solu-
tions involving inverse powers of the coupling [72,73]. An alternative body of work has focused on
constructing gravity ﬁelds from convolutions of gauge ﬁelds, in a variety of theories [59,74–78]. The
double copy has also been applied to classical solutions generated order-by-order in perturbation
theory [79–81].
Recently, ref. [82] considered generalising the double copy for amplitudes to include a non-trivial
background metric in the gravity theory. Let us deﬁne the graviton hµν according to
gµν = ¯gµν + κhµν,
(1)
where gµν is the full metric, and κ = √32πGN, with GN Newton’s constant. In the standard BCJ
double copy for amplitudes [1–3], one identiﬁes the background metric ¯gµν with the Minkowski
metric ηµν, so that zero graviton corresponds to the complete absence of gravity. One may instead
consider a diﬀerent choice, and indeed there may be good practical reasons for doing so: in a variety
of astrophysical and / or cosmological applications, one must analyse perturbations around a non-
trivial background metric. Reference [82] considered the particular case of so-called sandwich plane
waves, namely plane wave solutions whose deviation from Minkowski space has a ﬁnite extent in
space and time 4. One may consider such waves in either gauge theory or gravity, and the authors
demonstrate explicitly that a three-point amplitude for a graviton deﬁned as the deviation from
4More precisely, such waves are conﬁned to a ﬁnite region of the lightcone coordinate u = z −t, for a wave
travelling in the +z direction.

Figure 1: Two possible interpretations of a double copy in curved space: in type A, a gauge ﬁeld
has a non-trivial background ﬁeld ¯Aa
µ in Minkowski space, and copies to a graviton deﬁned on a
curved background ¯gµν, where ¯gµν and ¯Aa
µ are themselves related by a double copy relationship.
In type B, a gauge ﬁeld on a non-dynamical curved background ¯gµν double copies to a graviton
deﬁned around the same background.
a gravitational sandwich wave can be obtained as the double copy of a gauge theory three-point
function, where the gauge ﬁeld is deﬁned around a gauge theory sandwich wave. They further note
that this procedure is obtainable from ambitwistor string theory [83] (see also [84,85]), which would
in principle provide a general framework for formulating a similar procedure for diﬀerent types of
background.
Given the previously observed links between the Minkowski space amplitude double copy of refs. [1–
3] and the classical double copy of refs. [68–70], the results of ref. [82] suggest that some analogue
of the curved space amplitude double copy should also be possible for classical solutions. The aim
of this paper is to study this issue, and we will present a number of examples. Firstly, we will
construct Kerr-Schild solutions on a curved background by trivially rewriting single Kerr-Schild so-
lutions. We will be able to interpret such solutions as double copies of gauge ﬁelds with non-trivial
backgrounds, and we will call this relationship a type A curved space double copy. We will also ﬁnd
an alternative interpretation, namely that one may regard the graviton as being the double copy
of a gauge ﬁeld living on a non-dynamical curved spacetime background, which we will refer to as
type B. The diﬀerence between these two double copies is shown schematically in ﬁgure 1, and the
second of these is perhaps at odds with what one normally means by the double copy, which relates
entire gravity solutions to gauge theory counterparts in ﬂat space. It is then presumably the case
that the type B map is not fully general, but exists only in special cases. That does not however,
reduce its usefulness, where it applies.
After examining simple Kerr-Schild examples, we will generalise our ﬁndings to multiple Kerr-Schild
solutions, including a reexamination of the Taub-NUT spacetime considered in ref. [70]. Finally, we
will show a family of non-trivial examples of the type B double copy map, in which the background
spacetime is conformally ﬂat, without a Kerr-Schild form. This illustrates that this second type
of double copy map may be more applicable than na¨ıvely thought, and can also provide a double
copy in cases in which it is not known how to construct a double copy of type A.
The structure of the paper is as follows. In section 2, we brieﬂy review relevant details regarding
3

the classical double copy that will be needed in what follows. In section 3, we study Kerr-Schild
solutions from the viewpoint of a curved space double copy. In section 4, we consider the example
of Kerr-Schild solutions built upon conformally ﬂat background metrics. Finally, in section 5, we
discuss our results and conclude. Technical details are contained in the appendix.
2
The classical double copy
Here, we brieﬂy review the double copy for classical solutions of refs. [68–70]. Given that this will
be the focus of our paper, we will not discuss in detail the corresponding story for amplitudes (see
e.g. [86–88] for pedagogical reviews). Our starting point is to consider Kerr-Schild metrics, in which
the graviton, deﬁned in eq. (1), is given by
hµν = κ
2φkµkν.
(2)
Here φ(xµ) is a scalar function, and kµ is a 4-vector that is null and geodetic both with respect the
background and the whole metric. That is
gµνkµkν = ¯gµνkµkν = 0,
kµDµkν = 0,
(3)
where Dµ is the covariant derivative associated with the background metric, i.e. Dρ(¯gµν) = 0. The
null property implies that the index of the Kerr-Schild vector kµ can be raised with either ¯gµν or
gµν, where the inverse metric takes the simple form
gµν = ¯gµν −κ2
2 kµkνφ.
(4)
Upon substituting the ansatz of eq. (1) into the Einstein equations, one ﬁnds a linear form for the
Ricci tensor with the particular index placement shown below:
Rµ
ν = ¯Rµ
ν −κhµ
ρ ¯Rρ
ν + κ
2Dρ (Dνhµρ + Dµhρ
ν −Dρhµ
ν) ,
(5)
where ¯Rµν is the Ricci tensor associated with ¯gµν. Thus, if one ﬁnds a ﬁeld φ and Kerr-Schild
vector kµ such that the Einstein equations (vacuum or otherwise) are solved, this constitutes an
exact solution i.e. the graviton receives no higher order corrections.
Equation (5) simpliﬁes in the case that the background space is taken to be Minkowski
Rµ
ν
¯gµν →ηµν
−−−−−−→κ
2∂ρ (∂νhµρ + ∂µhρ
ν −∂ρhµ
ν) .
(6)
For a given ﬁeld φ and Kerr-Schild vector kµ, one may deﬁne a (non-abelian) gauge ﬁeld according
to
Aa
µ = caφkµ,
(7)
where ca is an arbitrary constant colour vector. For all stationary Kerr-Schild metrics (i.e. those
not depending explicitly on time), this gauge ﬁeld solves the linearised Yang-Mills equations:
∂µF a
µν = 0,
(8)
4

where F a
µν is the abelian-like ﬁeld strength tensor 5
F a
µν = ∂µ Aa
ν −∂ν Aa
µ.
(9)
To see this, note that eqs. (2, 6) imply
R0
i
¯gµν →ηµν
−−−−−−→κ
2∂ρ

∂i(φ k0 kρ) −∂ρ(φ k0 ki)

(10)
where we use latin indices to denote spatial components. Without loss of generality, one may choose
a coordinate system such that k0 = 1, such that the result of eq. (8) follows. As in gravity, the lin-
earisation of the ﬁeld equations is exact, so that the gauge ﬁeld receives no higher order corrections.
The gauge ﬁeld of eq. (7) is referred to as the single copy of its corresponding Kerr-Schild graviton
hµν, by analogy with the BCJ double copy for amplitudes [1–3]. In fact, the two double copies
are related to each other. One way to see this is take the zeroth copy of eq. (7), which involves
replacing the remaining copy of the vector kµ with a second colour vector:
Φaa′ = ca ˜ca′ φ.
(11)
This is a solution of a biadjoint scalar ﬁeld theory, whose equation is
∂2Φaa′ −yfabc ˜fa′b′c′Φbb′Φcc′ = 0,
(12)
where fabc and ˜fa′b′c′ are structure constants associated with two (potentially diﬀerent) Lie groups.
Indeed, eq. (11) is such that the nonlinear term in eq. (12) vanishes, leaving the simpler equation
∂2Φaa′ = 0.
(13)
When sources are present on the right-hand side, we can then interpret φ as a scalar propagator,
integrated over the source distribution. The fact that one does not modify the function φ upon tak-
ing the single or zeroth copies of eqs. (2, 7) is similar to the fact that denominators of amplitudes
(themselves interpretable as scalar propagators) remain the same in biadjoint scalar, gauge and
gravity theories. As mentioned above, stronger evidence for the connection between the classical
and amplitude double copies comes from considering the accelerated particle, where the Kerr-Schild
description recovers known amplitudes for the emission of soft photons and gravitons [69].
It is not known how to fully generalise the classical double copy to exact solutions which are not
of Kerr-Schild form. One way to make progress is to construct solutions order-by-order in a per-
turbation expansion in κ, as explored in refs. [79–81]. One may also explore known generalisations
of the Kerr-Schild ansatz. An example is the double Kerr-Schild ansatz, in which the graviton has
the form
hµν = κ
2
h
φ1kµkν + φ2lµlν.
i
(14)
There are now two scalar ﬁelds φi, and two separate Kerr-Schild vectors kµ and lµ, each of which
satisﬁes the null and geodetic requirements of eq. (3), as well as the mutual orthogonality condition
gµνkµlν = ¯gµνkµlν = 0.
(15)
5The non-linear term that is usually present in the non-abelian ﬁeld strength vanishes upon substituting the ansatz
of eq. (7).
5

Unlike in the single Kerr-Schild case, this ansatz is not guaranteed to linearise the Einstein equa-
tions: one ﬁnds a correction term to eq. (5), whose explicit form (in the present notation) may be
found in ref. [70]. A special case where linearity indeed occurs is the Taub-NUT solution [89,90],
whose Kerr-Schild form was ﬁrst presented in ref. [91]. The two terms in eq. (14) contain, respec-
tively, a Schwarzschild-like point mass M at the origin, and a NUT charge N, where the latter
gives rise to a rotational character in the gravitational ﬁeld at spatial inﬁnity. Reference [70] single
copied this solution by analogy with eq. (7):
Aa
µ = cah
φ1 kµ + φ2 lµ
i
.
(16)
Note that the single copy is taken term-by-term, analogous to the BCJ double copy for ampli-
tudes. The gauge theory solution was found to be a dyon. The electric charge in the gauge theory
maps to the Schwarzschild mass, as it must do for consistency with the pure Schwarzschild case.
The magnetic monopole charge of the gauge theory solution maps to the NUT charge, thus mak-
ing precise the statement that the Taub-NUT solution can be thought of as magnetic-monopole-like.
Of particular interest for the present study is the fact that ref. [70] considered the Taub-NUT
solution on a de Sitter background, as well as Minkowski space. The corresponding gauge ﬁeld was
then found to satisfy the curved space Maxwell equations
DµF a
µν = 0,
(17)
where Dµ is the covariant derivative associated with de Sitter space, and
F a
µν ≡DµAa
ν −DνAa
µ = ∂µAa
ν −∂νAa
µ
(18)
is the curved space ﬁeld strength tensor 6. This is already an example of the type B double copy
illustrated in ﬁgure 1, in which a graviton deﬁned around a non-Minkowski background is identiﬁed
with a gauge ﬁeld living on the same (non-dynamical) background. Given the fact that this map
is not what one ordinarily associates with the double copy, it is not clear what, if at all, the zeroth
copy of the gauge ﬁeld corresponds to. For the Taub-NUT example of ref. [70], the biadjoint ﬁeld
Φaa′ = ca ˜ca′
φ1 + φ2

(19)
was found to satisfy the equation
D2Φaa′ ≡DµDµΦaa′ = −2λΦaa′,
(20)
where λ is the cosmological constant. It was speculated that this was a solution of the biadjoint
theory conformally coupled to gravity, with Lagrangian
L = 1
2(DµΦaa′)(DµΦaa′) −y
6fabc ˜fa′b′c′Φaa′Φbb′Φcc′ −R
12Φaa′Φaa′,
(21)
where R is the Ricci scalar, a property making use of the fact that R ∝λ for de Sitter spacetime.
The constant of proportionality is precisely such as to make eq. (20) follow from eq. (21), in four
spacetime dimensions.
Having reviewed all necessary details regarding the Kerr-Schild double copy, we now turn to the
investigation of other curved space examples.
6The second equality in eq. (18) follows from the fact that terms involving the Christoﬀel symbol vanish upon
forming the antisymmetric combination of covariant derivatives.

Kerr-Schild solutions in curved space
As stated in the introduction, our examination of curved space instances of the classical double copy
is motivated by the results of ref. [82], concerning a double copy of type A. This associates a gauge
theory amplitude in the presence of a non-trivial background ﬁeld, with a gravity amplitude deﬁned
with respect to a non-Minkowski background metric, where the gauge and gravity background ﬁelds
should be related. In this section, we will see that Kerr-Schild solutions indeed provide a natural
framework for constructing such double copies for exact ﬁeld solutions, rather than perturbative
amplitudes.
3.1
Single Kerr-Schild solutions
The simplest such examples can be constructed, albeit rather artiﬁcially, by starting with single
Kerr-Schild metrics around Minkowski space. We may split up such solutions according to
gµν = ηµν + φkµkν
= ηµν + φ1kµkν + φ2kµkν,
(22)
where we have introduced
φ1 = ξφ,
φ2 = (1 −ξ)φ,
0 ≤ξ ≤1.
(23)
Thus, as is well-known (see e.g. [92]), any given single Kerr-Schild metric can always be thought of
as a double Kerr-Schild metric. Following the discussion of section 2, it is straightforward to single
copy eq. (22) term-by-term, resulting in the gauge ﬁeld
Aa
µ = cah
φ1kµ + φ2kµ
i
.
(24)
This is itself a rewriting of eq. (7), that is ultimately possible due to the linearity of the ﬁeld
equations in the Kerr-Schild double copy. However, we can reinterpret eqs. (22, 24) as follows. By
deﬁning
¯gµν = ηµν + φ1kµkν,
(25)
we may rewrite eq. (22) as
gµν = ¯gµν + ˜hµν,
˜hµν = φ2kµkν,
(26)
so that the solution of eq. (22) may be regarded as containing a graviton ﬁeld involving only the
ﬁeld φ2, deﬁned with respect to the non-Minkowski background ¯gµν. On the gauge theory side, we
can deﬁne
¯Aa
µ = caφ1kµ,
(27)
so that the solution of eq. (24) becomes
Aa
µ = ¯Aa
µ + ˜Aa
µ,
˜Aa
µ = caφ2kµ.
(28)
This is thus our ﬁrst example of a type A curved space double copy, for classical solutions rather
than amplitudes. A gauge ﬁeld deﬁned with respect to a non-trivial background ﬁeld copies to
a graviton ﬁeld with a non-trivial background, where the two backgrounds are themselves related
7

(i.e. they are themselves Kerr-Schild, so we know how to double copy them).
As indicated in ﬁgure 1, there is another way to consider double copies in curved space (type B).
Namely, it may be possible to single copy a graviton deﬁned with respect to a non-Minkowski
background, to a gauge ﬁeld living on the same background. To this end, one may consider the
graviton ﬁeld ˜hµν of eq. (26), which single copies to the ﬁeld ˜Aa
µ of eq. (28). On the gauge theory
side, one may impose the same background ¯gµν, and examine the curved space Maxwell equations
Dµ ˜F a
µν = jν,
(29)
where ˜F a
µν is the ﬁeld strength tensor formed from the gauge ﬁeld ˜Aa
µ. For a consistent double copy
of type B, one requires that the source current is somehow related to the energy-momentum tensor
in a recognisable way, so that the two solutions are related. Let us give two examples. Firstly, one
may consider the Schwarzschild metric, for which
φ = 2M
r ,
kµ = (1, 1, 0, 0),
(30)
where we adopt spherical polar coordinates (t, r, θ, φ). Writing the graviton as
hµν = 2M1
r
kµkν + 2M2
r
kµkν,
M1 + M2 = M,
(31)
we may deﬁne the background ﬁeld
¯gµν = ηµν + ¯hµν,
¯hµν = 2M1
r
kµkν,
(32)
and then single copy the graviton
˜hµν = 2M2
r
kµkν
(33)
to get a gauge ﬁeld
˜Aa
µ = ca
r kµ.
(34)
The curved space Maxwell equations of eq. (29) then yield 7
ja
µ = 0,
(35)
which is indeed consistent: the Schwarzschild metric is a vacuum solution in General Relativity.
Here we ﬁnd that its curved space single copy is also a (gauge theory) vacuum solution, on the
curved space deﬁned by ¯gµν.
A second example is given by de Sitter spacetime, which has the Kerr-Schild form
φ = λr2,
kµ = (−1, 1, 0, 0),
(36)
where λ is the cosmological constant. Splitting this similarly to eq. (31) gives
hµν = λ1r2kµkν + λ2r2kµkν,
λ1 + λ2 = λ.
(37)
7Here, we do not include the delta function source at the origin, corresponding to the point charge (mass) sourcing
the ﬁeld ˜Aa
µ (hµν).
8

We can then deﬁne the graviton
˜hµν = λ2r2kµkν,
(38)
whose single copy gauge ﬁeld
˜Aa
µ = caλ2r2kµ
(39)
satisﬁes the curved space Maxwell equation with
ja
ν = (6λ2, 0, 0, 0).
(40)
Again this makes sense: the graviton is sourced by a constant energy density ﬁlling all space which,
in the gauge theory, becomes a constant charge density. The single copy has thus turned momen-
tum degrees of freedom into colour degrees of freedom, precisely as in the ﬂat space case examined
in ref. [70] (and also the single copy for amplitudes [1–3]).
We have not been able to prove in general that the curved space Maxwell equations are satisﬁed for
arbitrary single Kerr-Schild solutions that are rewritten in the form of eq. (26). However, we have
at least shown for some special – and, indeed, astrophysically relevant – cases, a type B double
copy map is possible. The question then arises of how general this map is. The conventional double
copy, in its simplest form, relates a gauge theory to a gravity theory. A gauge theory on a curved
background (even if this is non-dynamical) would appear to involve gravity, and thus this type of
double copy map seems to relate a coupled Einstein-gauge theory system to itself. One does not
then expect this map to be fully general, or to apply to supersymmetric generalisations that are
known to work in ﬂat space.
Evidence towards this viewpoint can be gleaned by examining the zeroth copy. As discussed in
section 2, the Kerr-Schild ﬁeld φ is found to satisfy the linearised biadjoint scalar ﬁeld equation,
and can be interpreted as a scalar propagator. In the type II double copy, we can take the zeroth
copy of the gauge ﬁeld ˜Aa
µ to generate a scalar ﬁeld
˜Φaa′ = ca˜ca′φ2,
(41)
and consider the curved space linearised biadjoint equation
DµDµΦaa′ = ca˜ca′ξ,
(42)
which deﬁnes ξ. For the Schwarzschild and de Sitter examples, we ﬁnd
ξSWC = −4M1M2
r4
,
ξdS = 6λ2 −10r2λ1λ2
(43)
respectively, which we can not straightforwardly interpret as being related to the source current in
the gauge theory. It thus seems that the type B double copy can indeed associate a gauge theory
solution in curved space with a gravity counterpart, at the expense of not having a consistent
zeroth copy. This also sheds light on the speculation of ref. [70], that the zeroth copy for a curved
background may result in a biadjoint scalar theory conformally coupled to gravity (eq. (21)). The
results of eq. (43) provide a simple counter-example to this conjecture, showing that the situation
is more complex than previously thought.

3.2
Multiple Kerr-Schild solutions
In the previous section, we used single Kerr-Schild solutions to provide some ﬁrst examples of
curved space double copies, of both type A and type B. Here, we study whether such conclusions
also apply to more complicated solutions.
As a ﬁrst generalisation, we may consider multiple
Kerr-Schild solutions in Minkowski space, namely those of form
gµν = ηµν +
X
i
φik(i)
µ k(i)
ν ,
(44)
where each vector k(i)
µ is null and geodetic with respect to both the Minkowski and full metric, and
the set of Kerr-Schild vectors obeys the mutual orthogonality relations
ηµνk(i)
µ k(j)
ν
= gµνk(i)
µ k(j)
ν
= 0,
∀i, j.
(45)
In certain cases, this ansatz linearises the mixed Ricci tensor Rµ
ν, and thus provides an exact solution
of the Einstein equations 8. We further consider the general class of multi-Kerr-Schild solutions
in which each term in the graviton is itself a solution of the linearised Einstein equations. In the
stationary case, we may then single copy eq. (44) to produce a gauge ﬁeld
Aa
µ = ca X
i
φik(i)
µ .
(46)
Given that each term in the graviton constitutes a stationary Kerr-Schild solution, the results of
ref. [68] immediately imply that each term in eq. (46) satisﬁes the linearised Yang-Mills equations.
Linearity then implies that the complete ﬁeld of eq. (46) is also a solution, and thus a well-deﬁned
single copy of the gravity result.
As for the solution of eq. (22), we can use any multi-Kerr-Schild solution of the form of eqs. (44,
46) to construct a type A curved space double copy. To do this, one may partition the terms in
eq. (44) into two sets Γ1 and Γ2, before deﬁning
¯gµν = ηµν +
X
i∈Γ1
φik(i)
µ k(i)
ν ,
¯Aa
µ = ca X
i∈Γ1
φik(i)
µ ,
(47)
and
˜hµν = ηµν +
X
i∈Γ2
φik(i)
µ k(i)
ν ,
˜Aa
µ = ca X
i∈Γ2
φik(i)
µ .
(48)
The full gravity and gauge ﬁelds may now be written as
gµν = ¯gµν + ˜hµν,
Aa
µ = ¯Aa
µ + ˜Aa
µ.
(49)
This is indeed an example of the type A double copy shown in ﬁgure 1: the gauge ﬁeld ˜Aa
µ deﬁned
with respect to the background ﬁeld ¯Aa
µ double copies to the graviton ˜hµν, deﬁned with respect to
the background metric ¯gµν.
8Examples involving more than two terms are the higher dimensional Taub-NUT-like solutions of refs. [93,94].

eq. (46), we may deﬁne the biadjoint ﬁeld

The fact that each term in the gauge ﬁeld satisﬁes the linearised Yang-Mills equations implies,
again from ref. [68], that each term in eq. (50) satisﬁes the linearised biadjoint scalar equation.
Similarly to eq. (47), we may then deﬁne
¯Φaa′ = ca˜ca′ X
i∈Γ1
φi,
˜Φaa′ = ca˜ca′ X
i∈Γ2
φi,
(51)
so that the full biadjoint ﬁeld can be written
Φaa′ = ¯Φaa′ + ˜Φaa′.
(52)
This is a direct analogue of the type A double copy between gauge theory and gravity: a classical
ﬁeld deﬁned with respect to a background copies between biadjoint scalar and gauge theory. The
relationship between the three theories is shown in ﬁgure 2. Given that we will always be talking
about solutions of the linearised Yang-Mills equations from now on, we will omit colour indices and
vectors in what follows.
We may also examine whether or not it is possible to construct a type B double copy for multi-
Kerr-Schild solutions, by considering speciﬁc examples. In section 3.1, we saw that this was indeed
possible for the Schwarzschild and de Sitter solutions, split according to eqs. (22, 23).
More
generally, we can take either of these gravitons as part of the background metric ¯gµν, and allow
either of them to be the perturbation ˜hµν. The full list of possibilities is enumerated in table 1,
where the full metric is given by eq. (22), with kµ = (1, 1, 0, 0) in spherical polar coordinates. The
ﬁrst two rows contain the pure Schwarzschild (SWC) and de Sitter (dS) metrics, and the third /
fourth rows the cases already considered in the previous section. Finally, the ﬁfth and sixth rows
contain the metric formed by perturbing the Schwarzschild solution with a de Sitter Kerr-Schild
graviton, and vice versa. For each metric, we give an expression for the timelike component jt of

the source current that appears in the curved space Maxwell equation of eq. (29) (the spacelike
components are found to vanish in all cases), as well as the quantity ξ that appears on the right-
hand side of the curved space linearised biadjoint equation (eq. (42)).
In all cases, the type B single copy indeed holds. That is, the gauge theory contains a source
current consistent with the perturbation term in the gauge ﬁeld: zero in the Schwarzschild case 9,
and a uniform charge density in the de Sitter case, whose counterpart in gravity is the cosmolog-
ical constant. There are no terms in the source current which are sensitive to the ﬁeld φ1, which
would invalidate the picture of ﬁgure 1. The zeroth copy holds only in the cases of a pure single
Kerr-Schild solution (i.e. the cases considered in the original classical double copy of refs. [68,70]).
For all of the double Kerr-Schild solutions, the source includes a position-dependent term that has
no immediately evident counterpart in the gauge or gravity theory.
In the above examples, the full metric contains two Kerr-Schild terms, each of which has the same
vector kµ, corresponding to a spherically symmetric system. We can then ask what the most general
results for jt and ξ are, for unspeciﬁed functions φ1(r) and φ2(r). The results are
jt = 2φ′
2(r)
r
+ φ′′
2(r) = ∇2
Mφ2,
ξ = ∇2φ2 = jt(1 −φ1(r)) −φ′
1(r)φ′
2(r).
(53)
Here ∇2 is the Laplacian operator associated with the full background metric, and ∇2
M the corre-
sponding operator in Minkowski space. We thus conclude that if φ2 is associated with a vacuum
solution in Minkowski space, the type II single copy is well-deﬁned, in that it is also a vacuum
solution. However, the source for the zeroth copy involves the background ﬁeld φ1 and thus does
not seem to have a meaningful interpretation. Of course, the ﬁelds φ1 and φ2 in eq. (53) are not
arbitrary, but must be ﬁxed by the Einstein equations. For the case of spherically symmetric (and
stationary) vacuum solutions up to the presence of a cosmological constant, the only possible so-
lutions are the Schwarzschild and de Sitter cases examined already in table 1. Nevertheless, the
general form of the current in eq. (53) does not rule out that there may be non-trivial solutions
with extended sources, such that one may still ﬁnd a consistent single copy interpretation. It is not
known even in the ﬂat space case how to construct such maps (see e.g. refs. [69,71] for discussions
9As earlier, we do not bother showing the delta function source at the origin.
12

of source terms in various contexts).
Above we have discussed cases in which the background scalar ﬁeld φ1 is spherically symmetric.
Our results are more general than this, however. We have explicitly checked that our conclusion
that the type B single copy is a vacuum solution if φ2 is associated with a vacuum solution in
Minkowski space, holds true even if φ1 has an arbitrary spatial and temporal dependence.
It is furthermore useful to note that, as in the ﬂat space cases considered in ref. [68], one may
transform the type B single copy gauge ﬁeld into a more recognisable form. Starting with the
gauge ﬁeld in spherical polar coordinates,
Aµ = φ2(−1, 1, 0, 0),
one may perform a gauge transformation
Aµ →A′
µ = Aµ + Dµχ(r) = Aµ + ∂µχ(r),
(54)
where
χ(r) = −
Z r
dr′ φ2(r′),
(55)
so that eq. (54) implies
A′
µ = (−φ2, 0, 0, 0).
(56)
Thus, φ2 indeed has the interpretation of an electrostatic potential.
As implied above by the above results, the type B double copy is not necessarily expected to be a
fully general map between exact solutions in gauge and gravity theories in curved space. However,
it is interesting to examine whether or not it shares the property of the type A (and amplitude)
double copies, in being independent of the number of spacetime dimensions d. Indeed, one may
show that for a d-dimensional background metric ¯gµν of the form of eq. (25), the gauge ﬁeld ˜Aµ of
eq. (28) satisﬁes the Maxwell equations, with a current density given by 10
jµ = (∇2
Mφ2, 0, 0 . . . , 0),
(57)
where the Minkowski-space Laplacian on the right-hand side is in (d −1) space dimensions. Thus,
our above discussion generalises for any d. We present a proof of these statements in appendix A.
Having examined multiple Kerr-Schild solutions where each term contains the same Kerr-Schild
vector kµ, it is instructive to instead consider an example in which these vectors can be diﬀerent.
One such example is the Taub-NUT solution, for which the metric takes the form
gµν = ηµν + φkµkν + ψlµlν.
(58)
The Minkowski line element can be written as
ds2 = −dt2 +
ρ2
a2 + r2 dr2 + ρ2dθ2 + (r2 + a2) sin2 θdϕ2
(59)

while the scalar functions φ and ψ are given by

.
(63)
As for the various metrics considered in table 1, in considering the type B single copy, we can take
either of the Kerr-Schild terms to be part of the background metric, resulting in two possibilities:
Case 1:
gµν = ¯gµν + φkµkν,
¯gµν = ηµν + ψlµlν,
Case 2:
gµν = ¯gµν + ψlµlν,
¯gµν = ηµν + φkµkν.
The gauge ﬁelds obtained from the single copy of the perturbation term in both cases satisfy
homogeneous Maxwell equations
jν = 0,
(64)
so that the single copy is indeed consistent (n.b. the Taub-NUT solution is a vacuum solution).
The zeroth copy factor is given in both cases by
ξ = 4φψ(ρ2 −2r2)
ρ4
,
(65)
so that, consistently with our previous results, the type B single copy does not appear to be mean-
ingful.
Let us summarise the results of this section. We have examined whether it is possible to construct
a double copy for classical solutions that mimics the result found for amplitudes in ref. [82]. We
have indeed found such a procedure, based on the same Kerr-Schild solutions that were used to
formulate a ﬂat space double copy in refs. [68–70]. In this picture, a gauge ﬁeld deﬁned with respect
to a non-trivial background ﬁeld copies to a graviton deﬁned with respect to a background metric,
where the background ﬁelds in the two theories are related. We were able to relate the background
ﬁelds due to the fact that they obeyed the original Kerr-Schild double copy by themselves. Fur-
thermore, there is a well-deﬁned zeroth copy, in which the resulting biadjoint ﬁeld is also deﬁned
with respect to a background, where the latter is the zeroth copy of the background gauge ﬁeld.
We call this procedure a type A curved space double copy, to distinguish it from an alternative
procedure (type B) in which the gauge ﬁeld lives on a non-dynamical curved spacetime, and copies
to a graviton ﬁeld deﬁned with respect to the same spacetime. In this picture, the zeroth copy does
not appear to be meaningful, in that the biadjoint ﬁeld appears not to be physically related to its
14

gauge theory counterpart, due to the presence of unwanted source terms.
In all of the above cases, we knew how to construct a type A double copy due to the fact that we
could relate the background gauge ﬁeld with its gravitational counterpart. The type B double copy,
however, does not require such a relationship, as the same curved metric appears in both the gauge
and gravity theories. It is then interesting to look for examples of this relationship in which the
background metric is not of Kerr-Schild form, and thus cannot be single-copied according to the
procedure of refs. [68–70]. We have indeed found such examples, which we describe in the following
section.
4
Conformally ﬂat background metrics
In this section, we consider conformally ﬂat spacetimes.
More speciﬁcally, we consider space-
times whose metrics can be written (in some coordinate system) as a conformal transformation of
Minkowski space:
¯gµν = Ω2(xµ)ηµν.
(66)
As the bar notation on the left-hand side already suggests, we will use such metrics as background
metrics for Kerr-Schild solutions. This will work for any conformally ﬂat metric, given that if kµ
is null and geodetic with respect to the Minkowski metric, it is straightforward to show that it is
also null and geodetic with respect to ¯gµν.
As a warm-up, let us examine the case where the background is the well-known Einstein static
universe. For convenience, we will adopt the coordinates and conventions of ref. [95], such that the
line element is
d¯s2 = −dt2 + dr2 −2a sin2 θdϕdr + |β|2
D2 dθ2 + (|β|2 + a2 sin2 θ) sin2 θdϕ2,
(67)
where
D = 1 −(a2/R2
0) sin2 θ,
β = (R2
0 −a2)1/2 sin r
R0
+ ia cos θ.
The Ricci tensor and scalar for this metric take the particularly simple forms
¯Rµν = 2
R2
0
(¯gµν + ¯uµ¯uν),
¯R = 6
R2
0
,
(68)
respectively, where uµ is the unit timelike vector given by
¯uµ = (1, 0, 0, 0),
¯uµ = (−1, 0, 0, 0).
(69)
We can construct a solution
gµν = ¯gµν + 2Hkµkν
(70)
15

of single Kerr-Schild form, where for the Kerr-Schild term we adopt the notation of ref. [95] for
ease of comparison. The Kerr-Schild vector kµ is deﬁned by
√
2kµ = (−1, −1, 0, a sin2 θ),
(71)
while the scalar function
H = mDµkµ,
(72)
with Dµ the covariant derivative associated with ¯gµν. The solution deﬁned by eqs. (70-72) cor-
responds to a rotating black hole over the Einstein static universe. In order to further examine
the eﬀect of this perturbation, we note that the mixed-index Ricci tensor of the full metric can be
recast in the form
Rµ
ν = −2
R2
0
(1 −H)(δµ
ν + uµuν),
(73)
where we have introduced the vectors
uµ =
¯uµ
√
1 −H ,
uµ =
1
√
1 −H (¯uµ +
√
2Hkµ).
(74)
The Einstein equations then become
Rµ
ν −1
2δµ
ν R = −8π((ρ + p)uµuν + pδµ
ν ) + Λδµ
ν.
(75)
That is, the matter content of the theory is that of a perfect ﬂuid, whose energy density ρ and
pressure p are given in this case by
8πρ = 3
R2
0
(1 −H) −Λ,
(76)
8πp = −1
R2
0
(1 −H) + Λ.
(77)
We see that the presence of the Kerr-Schild term acts to redeﬁne the parameters associated with
the background metric, reminiscent of the split Kerr-Schild metrics we considered in section 3.1. A
number of other such solutions are presented in ref. [95].
We may single copy the graviton appearing in eq. (70) by deﬁning the gauge ﬁeld
Aa
µ = caHkµ,
(78)
which we ﬁnd satisﬁes the homogeneous linearised Yang-Mills equation
DµF µν = 0,
(79)
where Dµ, as above, is the covariant derivative for the Einstein static universe. This provides an
example of the type B double copy of ﬁgure 1: on the gravity side, a ﬂuid is needed to source the
background metric. There is no corresponding source current in the gauge theory, as there is no
16

background gauge ﬁeld, unlike in the type A double copy.
In the previous examples of the type B double copy, we saw that the zeroth copy did not appear
to have a meaningful interpretation. Interestingly, in the present example the ﬁeld H satisﬁes the
homogeneous linearised biadjoint scalar equation
D2H = 0,
(80)
which indeed leads to a well-deﬁned zeroth copy for this case.
Having seen a particular example of the type B single copy for non-Kerr-Schild backgrounds, let us
now consider the general case of background metrics of the form of eq. (66), where the Minkowski
metric is given in spherical polar coordinates (t, r, θ, φ), so that the conformally transformed metric
takes the form
¯gµν = Ω2(xµ)diag(−1, 1, r2, r2 sin2 θ),
(81)
Upon constructing the gauge ﬁeld
Aµ = kµφ2(r),
kµ = (−1, 1, 0, 0),
(82)
we ﬁnd that this satisﬁes the curved space Maxwell equation (in the spacetime whose metric is ¯gµν)
DµF µν = jν,
jν =
 ∇2
Mφ2
Ω4(xµ), 0, 0, 0

,
(83)
where ∇2
M is the Minkowski space Laplacian operator. Note that this result does not require the
conformal factor Ωto have spherical symmetry - it may be a general function of (t, r, θ, φ). From
eq. (83), we see that if the gauge ﬁeld of eq. (82) satisﬁes a vacuum Maxwell equation in Minkowski
space, it also does so in the conformally transformed metric, analogous to the double Kerr-Schild
examples considered in the previous section. Thus, the Minkowski space single copy extends to a
type B curved space double copy, even though the background metric ¯gµν does not have a Kerr-
Schild form, and thus is not immediately amenable to a type A single copy. We may also examine
the type B zeroth copy, and one ﬁnds the curved space linearised biadjoint equation
DµDµφ2 = ∇2
Mφ2
Ω2(xµ) + 2φ′
2(r)∂rΩ(xµ)
Ω3(xµ)
.
(84)
The second term on the right-hand side involves a spatial derivative of the conformal factor, which
is not present in the gauge theory source. Thus, it does not seem possible to interpret the zeroth
copy in general, in line with our previous conclusions for the type B procedure.

Discussion
The aim of this paper has been to examine whether or not the classical double copy of refs. [68–70]
can yield gravitons deﬁned around a non-Minkowski background metric. Our motivation is the
recent study of [82], which constructs such a procedure for amplitudes. They consider gauge ﬁelds
corresponding to perturbations around a plane-wave solution, whose amplitudes double copy to
amplitudes for gravitons deﬁned with respect to a gravitational plane wave background. We call
17

this an example of a type A curved space double copy, depicted schematically in ﬁgure 1, and in
which a gauge ﬁeld deﬁned with respect to a non-trivial background copies to a graviton deﬁned
with respect to a non-Minkowsi metric, where the background ﬁelds in both cases are related. We
have shown that one can indeed construct such a double copy for classical solutions, based on Kerr-
Schild solutions, which underlie the classical double copy of refs. [68–70] in ﬂat space. Furthermore,
there is a well-deﬁned zeroth copy, which maps the gauge ﬁeld to a biadjoint scalar ﬁeld, satisfying a
linearised equation of motion. This is itself interesting for the curved space amplitude double copy
of ref. [82]. There, the authors considered three-point amplitudes, which do not contain propagator
factors. For the ﬂat space double copy, the fact that the zeroth copy exists for classical solutions
is related to how one deals with propagator factors in amplitudes. Thus, the fact that the zeroth
copy also works for the type A curved space double copy suggests that the results of ref. [82] can
indeed be generalised to higher-point amplitudes.
We also saw that it was possible to interpret the type A classical double copy in an alternative
way, namely that one can associate a graviton deﬁned with respect to a non-Minkowski background
metric, with a gauge ﬁeld living on the same spacetime. We named this a type B double copy, and
presented a number of non-trivial examples. In almost all of the cases studied here, the zeroth copy
does not have a meaningful interpretation, suggesting that the type B double copy is not a fully
general relationship between gauge and gravity theories that is rooted in ﬁrst principles, but rather
a map that applies in certain special cases. Nevertheless, it could be very useful to have such a
map, particularly when the background spacetimes (e.g. the de Sitter metric) are cosmologically
relevant. Furthermore, a type B double copy may exist even when it is not known how to formulate
a type A copy, due to e.g. having a background metric that is not of Kerr-Schild form - we have here
given the explicit example of conformally ﬂat metrics, including the Einstein static universe. One
may prove in general that for stationary spherically symmetric gauge ﬁelds on a conformally ﬂat
metric, a vacuum Maxwell equation in Minkowski space implies a vacuum solution on the curved
space, and thus a meaningful type B single copy.
Our results provide a way of extending the classical double copy of ref. [68–70], and will prove
useful in further investigations of the double copy, and its applications. A number of avenues for
further work suggest themselves. Firstly, it would be interesting to know whether a type A double
copy can be set up for background metrics that are not Kerr-Schild. Secondly, it would be useful to
systematically determine the circumstances in which the type B double copy applies, including the
possible addition of non-trivial source terms. Finally, one may investigate whether the type A or
type B double copies allow for new insights or calculations relevant for astrophysics and cosmology.

A
The type B single copy in d dimensions
In this appendix, we consider the Maxwell equation for the gauge ﬁeld
Aµ = φ2(r)kµ,
kµ = (−1, 1, 0, . . . , 0)
in a d-dimensional spacetime with spherical polar coordinates (t, r, θ1, . . . , θd−2) whose metric is
given by
¯gµν = ηµν + φ1(xρ)kµkν.
Note that, for the sake of generality, we allow φ1 to depend on all coordinates. One may then
construct the ﬁeld strength tensor
Fµν = DµAν −DµAν = ∂µAν −∂νAµ,
where the second equality follows in the absence of torsion. It is straightforward to show that the
only non-zero components of this tensor are
Ftr = −Frt = −φ′
2(r).
(85)
The curved space Maxwell equation is given by
DµF µν = ∂µF µν + ¯Γµ
µα F αν + ¯Γν
µα F µα = jν,
(86)
where ¯Γα
βγ is the Christoﬀel symbol associated with ¯gµν. From the standard result
¯Γα
βγ = 1
2¯gασ(∂β¯gγσ + ∂γ¯gβσ −∂σ¯gβγ),
one ﬁnds that the only non-zero Christoﬀel symbols are given by
¯Γt
tr = −¯Γr
rr = −1
2(1 + φ1)∂rφ1 + 1

The current in eq. (86) is then found to be

where
