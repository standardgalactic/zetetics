OTHER TRIGONOMETRIC PROOFS OF PYTHAGORAS
THEOREM
NUNO LUZIA
Abstract. Only very recently a trigonometric proof of the Pythagoras theo-
rem was given by Zimba [1], many authors thought this was not possible. In
this note we give other trigonometric proofs of Pythagoras theorem by estab-
lishing, geometrically, the half-angle formula cos θ = 1 −2 sin2 θ

1. Pythagoras theorem
Pythagoras theorem is ilustrated in ﬁgure below.

a2 + b2 = c2
To prove this theorem it is enough to consider the particular case c = 1, for then
the general case follows by rescaling. Deﬁne the trigonometric functions sin θ and
cos θ, for 0 < θ < 90◦, as usual (see Figure 1).

valid for 0 < α, β, α−β < 90◦, can be proved geometrically without using Pythago-
ras theorem (see [1]). Zimba [1] used these formulas to prove Pythagoras theorem.
The addition formula
cos(α + β) = cos α cos β −sin α sin β,
0 < α, β, α + β < 90◦, can, in the same way, also be proved geometrically without
using Pythagoras theorem, from which it follows the half-angle formula
cos θ = cos2 θ
2 −sin2 θ
2.
(2)
If we use Pythagoras formula (1) in (2) then we get
cos θ = 1 −2 sin2 θ
2.
(3)
What if we could prove (3) without using Pythagoras theorem? Then using (2) and
(3) we would get the Pythagoras formula (1) !
1.1. Proof of half-angle formulas. First we observe the simple fact that in an
isosceles triangle with two equal sides with length 1, forming an angle θ, the length
of the other side is 2 sin θ
2. This can be seen by dividing the isosceles triangle in
two right triangles with an angle θ
2. See Figure 2.

Also the other angles β of the isosceles triangle satisfy θ + β + β = 180◦or
β = 90◦−θ
2. Of course, by deﬁnition, cos(90◦−θ) = sin θ and sin(90◦−θ) = cos θ.
Now consider the two right triangles as in Figure 3, which together form an
isosceles triangle as in Figure 2.

Using the trigonometric relations for the right hand side triangle, we get
1 −cos θ = 2 sin θ
2 cos(90◦−θ
2),
sin θ = 2 sin θ
2 sin(90◦−θ
2),
or
cos θ = 1 −2 sin2 θ
2,
(4)
sin θ = 2 sin θ
2 cos θ
2.
(5)
As mentioned before, (4) together with (2) imply the Pythagoras formula (1).
1.2. Another proof. Here we prove the Pythagoras theorem using formulas (4)
and (5) (instead of using formulas (4) and (2)). We get
cos2 θ + sin2 θ = 1 −4 sin2 θ
