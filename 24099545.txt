 HISTORICAL NOTES
 from the one he got from Wallis and
 Brouncker' and 'he had been able to
 extract from it a formal proof of the fact
 that it always leads to a solution'. The
 method 'which Wallis credits to
 Brouncker' is 'equivalent to the Indian
 cakravala method as well as to the mod
 em treatments based on continued frac
 tion'.

 Addendum
 Fifty years of the exact solution of ^s'n8 was a teacher (and later became the headm
 ter) of a Jewish school in Germany from 1934 to No
 vember 1938. When his school was damaged, he
 the two-dimensional Ising model by
 Onsager managed to leave Germany. It was as late as 1949 that
 he realized that his name had become famous.
 It seems that Ising also agrees that the model should

 Avinash Khare model' became popular following the title of Peierls'
 paper12.
 [Curr. Sei., 1995, 69, 816-821] It appears that Heisenberg in his 1928 paper8 also
 thought that at least eight nearest neighbours are needed
 We would like to make the following correc- for a phase transition. We are not sure whether this
 tions/additions which we learnt after the paper was comment by Heisenberg refers to the Ising model or to
 written. the new model he proposed in that paper.
