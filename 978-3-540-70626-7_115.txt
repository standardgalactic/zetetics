Using the fact (deducible from the power series expansion of exp x) that
exp(−ietσ1) = (cos et −iσ1 sin et) one can easily deduce just from the rules
given above that the probability identiﬁed above is (sin et)2. The calculation is
carried out without referring to any space-time picture of what is going on.

Matter Waves
Bruce R. Wheaton
Among the audacious proposals in the evolution of natural philosophy, Louis de
Broglie’s (1892–1987) claim in 1923 that atoms possess a wave-property sits at top
rank. Substantial matter had from ancient times been ascribed to particles like those
we encounter everyday. While there was always doubt whether light is material or
a disturbance in a medium (see  wave-particle duality) there had never been much
doubt about matter. A noteworthy, late nineteenth century exception in the wake of
Maxwellian success in ﬁeld theory came to be called “the electromagnetic world-
view,” based on Kantian idealism, that described ponderable matter as secondary
properties of the primary æther.
However, Albert Einstein’s (1879–1955) tri-partite recasting of matter, light, and
time in 1905 gave a molecular explanation in accord with that of Jean Perrin (1870–
1942) to long-observed  Brownian motion, and atoms prevailed. In the 1920s,
practical concerns of physicists in France led to de Broglie’s recognition of a para-
dox, particularly in the domain of  x-rays, when he tried to bring coherence to
both new theories: of the quantum and of relativity.
France may seem an unlikely locale and 31-year old Louis de Broglie an even
more unlikely source for so earth-shaking an inspiration. But under the tutelage of
elder brother Maurice (1875–1960), Louis and a cadre of young physicists tried
to apply the new ﬁn-de-si`ecle discoveries in physics to improve French industrial
process control. Entirely privately funded, and virtually independent of academic

Fig. 1 M. de Broglie & A. Dauvillier’s sample at C, irradiated with x-rays, emits electrons into
the normal magnetic ﬁeld that are sorted by velocity onto photoplate PP’. From M. de Broglie, Les
rayons x (Paris, 1922), 142
physics, Maurice’s “Laboratoire franc¸aise des rayons-x” drew talent from all of Eu-
rope. For our purposes the most important was Alexandre Dauvillier (1892–1979),
whose passion was the x-ray  photoelectric effect. Together with Maurice, he
showed experimentally by the 1921 Solvay congress, that x-rays must be absorbed
by matter in discrete quantum units, using β-ray spectroscopy to measure velocities
of emitted  electrons (Fig. 1). In all cases the corpuscular behavior of e-m radi-
ation prevailed. Charles Ellis (1895–1980) presented equivalent results for nuclear
 γ-rays at the same session.
“Little Louis” heard all of the Solvay discussions and tried to bring coherence to
what he called the “dual wave-particle nature of radiation.” He turned to Einstein’s
other two remarkable products of 1905, the  light-quantum and relativity theory. In
brief, relativity predicts that time intervals on a moving particle will appear length-
ened to a stationary observer: that makes an observed frequency lower. But quantum
theory predicts a moving particle possesses more energy and exhibits a higher fre-
quency. Louis found a clever, most perplexing, way to reconcile this conundrum.
“We debated the most pressing and bafﬂing issues of the time,” Louis recalled to his
elder brother, “particularly the interpretation of results in your experiments on the
x-ray photoeffect.”
Louis’ inspiration in 1923 was to posit a virtual wave that accompanies (actually
precedes) every particle of matter. He had turned Einstein’s light-quantum on its
head: if light can be corpuscular, matter can be undulatory. Every particle of matter,
he posited, has a guiding “phase wave” that travels faster than the particle such that
vpvw = c2. The advantage is that these two oscillations maintain constructive inter-
ference at a moving point in space that essentially deﬁnes the observed trajectory of
the particle. His hypothesis owed much to prior work by Vito Volterra (1860–1940),
Marcel Brillouin (1854–1948) and Erwin Schr¨odinger (1887–1961) on theories of
“retarded potentials.” Louis’ phase wave travels faster than the velocity of light, has
wavelength λ = h/p, carries no energy, and so he referred to it as an onde ﬁctiv.

But this wave has a physical signiﬁcance beyond a mere calculating device. On its
basis he derived the action-integral representation of stable electron orbits in the
Bohr atom (each revolution a standing wave-like band), and explained the contem-
poraneous Compton–Debye effect. This inﬂuential experiment on generalized x-ray
scattering also conﬁrmed the corpuscular nature of x-rays. The audacious proposal
of an inescapable wave-property of atoms “stuck the issue right under the nose” of
Erwin Schr¨odinger who clariﬁed the concept into the new  wave mechanics in
1926. Louis’ phase wave of 1923 also predicted diffraction of an electron beam,
experiments corroborated by 1929 leading to his Nobel Prize.
