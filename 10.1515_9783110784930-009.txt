Contentful Syllogistic Inference
Contentful syllogistic inference consists simply in putting in contentfully determi-
nate propositions or concept expressions (i.e., propositions like ‘Socrates is mortal’
or concept expressions like ‘mortal’ and ‘human being’) in place of propositional or
conceptual variables in the schemata for syllogistic inferences and consequences.
However, in the present Section I will consider contentful syllogistic inferences
only insofar as they contain contentfully determinate concept expressions which
implicitly occur in the calculus of functions as well and play a foundational role in
it. To this extent, this Section has only a preparatory character with respect to the
sixth and seventh Sections. It shows that the language of the calculus of functions
differs from the language of the syllogistic mainly in that the former involves com-
plex conceptual contents and logically relevant structures of such contents. This
Section also shows that this involvement entails a linguistic transformation of the
logical rules of the syllogistic, without in any way affecting the validity of these
rules. It shows, finally, that contrary to a widespread opinion, the syllogistic is
completely capable of explaining the logical validity of inferences that seem to
obey no rules other than those peculiar to the calculus of functions.
§ 64 Notation
To be able to present some concrete conceptual contents which may occur in
premises and conclusions of syllogistic inferences, I will substitute for some con-
cept variables certain conceptual constants and for others certain constellations
of logical and descriptive signs of the following kind.
(1) I use as logical signs:
(a) the three quantifier prefixes (∀xi) . . .’ (as the prefix for the universal quanti-
fier), ‘(∃xi) . . .’ (as the prefix for the existential quantified) and ‘(∇xi) . . .’
(as the quantifier prefix for a singular proposition) (each with i ≧1),
(b) the predicator prefix ‘(′xi) . . .’ (with i ≧1).
(2) As descriptive signs I use:
(a) Individual constants ‘a1’, ‘a2’, ‘a3’, etc.;
(b) Functional expressions
https://doi.org/10.1515/9783110784930-009

‘F1 (x1)’, ‘F2 (x1)’, ‘F3 (x1)’, etc.,
‘F1 (x1, x2)’, ‘F2 (x1, x2)’, ‘F3 (x1, x2)’, etc.,
...
‘F1 (x1, . . ., xn)’, ‘F2 (x1, . . ., xn)’, ‘F3 (x1, . . ., xn)’, (with n > 2) etc.;
in these expressions the different argument places (in which the individual
variables ‘x1’, ‘x2’, . . ., ‘xn’ appear) can be fully or partly occupied by individual
constants; they can also be occupied, fully or partly, by one and the same indi-
vidual constant or by one and the same individual variable;
(c) Conceptual constants ‘ξ1’, ‘ξ2’, ‘ξ3’ etc., and ‘ζ1’, ‘ζ2’, ‘ζ3’, etc.
(3) Metalinguistic designations:
(a) As a substitute for an individual variable ‘x1’ or ‘x2’ or ‘x3’ etc., I use the itali-
cized lower-case letter ‘v’.
(b) As a substitute for an individual constant ‘a1’ or ‘a2’ or ‘a3’ etc., I use the itali-
cized lower-case letter ‘t’.
(c) As a substitute for an arbitrary (and arbitrarily complex) functional expres-
sion, but which contains only one freely occurring variable ‘v’, I use one of
the expressions ‘A (v)’, ‘B (v)’, ‘C (v)’, etc.
(d) As a substitute for a conceptual constant ‘ξ1’ or ξ2’ or ‘ξ3’, etc., I use ‘ξ’ (without
an index numeral) and likewise for a conceptual constant ‘ζ1’, or ‘ζ2’ or ‘ζ3’,
etc., I use ‘ζ’ (without an index numeral).
(4) Abbreviations:
(a) ‘F1’, ‘F2’, and ‘F3’ may be abbreviated by ‘F’, ‘G’, and ‘K’, ‘x1’, ‘x2’, and ‘x3’ by ‘x’,
‘y’, and ‘z’, and finally ‘a1’, ‘a2’, and ‘a3’ by ‘a’, ‘b’, and ‘c’.
(b) ‘Ạ((′v) A (v), ζ)’ is abbreviated by ‘[A (t)]’,
‘A ((′v) A (v), ξ)’ by ‘(∀v) A (v)’,
‘I ((′v) A (v), ξ)’ by ‘(∃v) A (v)’ and finally
‘Ạ((′v) A (v), ξ)’ by ‘(∇v) A (v)’.
The square brackets in ‘[A (t)]’ deserve special notice, since they may not be set
aside without further ado. Namely, if A equals N B, then ‘[A (t)]’ abbreviates
the expression ‘Ạ((′v) N B (v), ζ)’, which, it should be noted, is not equivalent to
‘N Ạ((′v) B (v), ζ)’. Hence, ‘[N B (t)]’ and ‘N [B (t)]’ are not equivalent either. The
square brackets may be omitted only if it is provable that two formulas, which
differ from each other only by the occurrence of one of these two expressions
in each, render equally valid rules.

§ 65 Comments on the Notation
With the signs and sign connectors I have introduced in § 64 and which I will discuss
more precisely in what follows, expressions are introduced which stand for concept
words or components of certain concept expressions. Among such components, I
also count the expressions which are called quantifiers in modern logic books. These
are abbreviations for expressions which take the place of the grammatical subject in
categorical propositions, but they can also appear as components of concept words.
1. The conceptual constant ξ abbreviates the specific concept expression ‘object
which is a member of the non-empty domain of the objects designated by “v”.
This constant can take the place of a concept variable in a syllogistic expression.
2. The conceptual constant ζ abbreviates the specific concept expression ‘bearer
of the proper name t’. This constant can also take the place of a concept variable
in a syllogistic expression.
3. The predicator (′v) always appears as a prefix, and always in connection with a
functional expression which by itself contains a freely occurring individual vari-
able v. This prefix transforms an open proposition of the form A (v) into a concept
expression, so that ‘(′v) A (v)’ is equivalent to the concept expression ‘object which
is designated by “v” in A (v) and for which A (v) holds’.
4. The universal quantifier (∀v) always appears as a prefix, and always in con-
nection with a functional expression which by itself contains a freely occurring
individual variable v. This prefix transforms an open proposition of the form A
(v) into a universal affirmative categorical proposition, so that ‘(∀v) A (v)’ is
equivalent to the syllogistic expression A ((′v) A (v), ξ).
5. The existential quantifier (∃v) always appears as a prefix, and always in con-
nection with a functional expression which by itself contains a freely occurring
individual variable v. This prefix transforms an open proposition of the form A
(v) into a particular affirmative categorical proposition, so that ‘(∃v) A (v)’ is
equivalent to the syllogistic expression I ((′v) A (v), ξ).
6. The quantifier (∇v) always appears as a prefix, and always in connection with
a functional expression which by itself contains a freely occurring individual var-
iable v. This prefix transforms an open proposition of the form A (v) into a singu-
lar affirmative categorical proposition, so that ‘(∇v) A (v)’ is equivalent to the
syllogistic expression ‘Ạ((′v) A (v), ξ)’.
Remark: The relationship between an open proposition A (v) and one of the ex-
pressions which transforms this proposition into a closed proposition, i.e., the
Section Five Contentful Syllogistic Inference § 65
263

relationship between A (v) and one of the expressions t, (∀v), (∃v) and (∇v),
corresponds to the relationship between the grammatical predicate and a gram-
matical subject of a categorical proposition. The grammatical subject is, namely,
that part of the proposition which specifies or names that about which a categorical
proposition deals. By contrast, the grammatical predicate is that part of the proposi-
tion which contains what the categorical proposition states about what it deals with
(cf. § 27). Thus, t, (∀v), (∃v) or (∇v) name or specify that about which a certain
categorical proposition deals, namely, taken in sequence: the individual t, every in-
dividual v, some individual v, or precisely the individual v. By contrast, A (v) con-
tains precisely that which is categorically stated about these subjects, namely: that
A (v). (‘A (v)’ here means the same as ‘v is an A’, where ‘v’ only designates an empty
place.)
Hence, the prefix (′v) can be taken as an operator which transforms a gram-
matical predicate A (v) into a logical predicate, i.e., into a concept expression (a
so-called term). Namely, ‘(′x) A x’, ‘(′y) B (y)’, etc. are to be regarded as expressions
which can stand for concept expressions of an arbitrary content, in the same way
as ‘α’, ‘β’, etc. can. In other words, they fulfill the same task as concept variables.
Unlike them, ‘(′x) F x’, ‘(′y) G (y)’, etc. always stand for concept expressions of a
specific content. Namely, these expressions indicate that they correspond exclu-
sively to one-place (monadic) functional expressions ‘F (x)’, ‘G (y)’, etc.
Frege noticed that functions have something to do with concepts and objects
have something to do with arguments of functions. Yet since he confused the
grammatical predicate with the logical predicate and the grammatical subject
with the logical subject, he erroneously believed he could equate concepts with
functions and that ‘F (a)’ expresses not a relation between concepts, but rather
stands for a “logically basic relation” (see §§ 25–28 and §§ 32–35 above).
§ 66 Examples of Contentful Syllogistic Inference
The language of signs discussed in § 65 can be employed directly for the sake of
presenting concrete contentful inferences (not only modes of inference or inference
rules). It goes without saying that all valid rules and modes of inference from §§
53–63 remain valid when concept expressions of the form (′v) A (v), with an arbi-
trary interpretation for A, are substituted for a concept variable (α, β, . . .) in all
places of its occurrence. But there is also a kind of contentful inference whose va-
lidity, though it is based on universally valid basic syllogistic rules, is not derivable
from these as before. Consider as illustration the following inference.
264
Part II Section Five Contentful Syllogistic Inference

Example:
All circles are figures.
Thus: if someone draws something that is not a figure, then someone draws something that is
not a circle.
This inference can be presented symbolically in such a way that one makes use
only of syllogistic formulas, but in that case a notation like the one discussed in §
65 must be used.
To this end, we can introduce the following conventions for the translation of
the terms ‘circle’ and ‘figure’. The functional sign ‘C (x1)’ abbreviates the open propo-
sition (or the grammatical predicate) ‘. . . is a circle’. Then the formula ‘(′x1) C (x1)’
stands for the specific term ‘circle’. In the same way, ‘F (x1)’ serves to abbreviate the
grammatical predicate ‘. . . is a figure’, so that ‘(′x1) F (x1)’ stands for the specific term
‘figure’. On the basis of these two stipulations, we may render the premise of the
above inference: ‘All circles are figures’ with the formula
‘A ((′x1) F (x1), (′x1) C (x1))’.
In addition, we can render the proposition ‘this object is a circle’ with the formula
‘Ạ((′x1) C (x1), ξ1)’,
and, similarly, the proposition ‘if something is a circle, then it is a figure’ with the
formula
‘H (I ((′x1) C (x1), ξ1), Ạ((′x1) F (x1), ξ1)’.
Now let the functional sign ‘D (x2, x1)’ abbreviate ‘x2 draws x1’. The expression
‘(′x2) (∃x1) D (x2, x1)’ is then equivalent to the term ‘drawer of something’,
whereby ‘something’ means a member of the domain which is referenced in the
x2-position of the functional sign that appears in the present context. On the basis
of this further stipulation, we may write for ‘someone draws an object’:
‘I ((′x2) (∃x1) D (x2, x1), ξ2))’.
The proposition ‘If someone draws something, then this is not a figure’ can be ex-
pressed by the formula
‘H (I ((′x2) (∃x1) D (x2, x1), ξ2)), N Ạ((′x1) F (x1), ξ1))’,
Section Five Contentful Syllogistic Inference § 66
265

so that the proposition, ‘If someone draws something that is not a figure, then
someone draws something that is not a circle’ takes the following shape:
H (H (I ((′x2) (∃x1) D (x2, x1), ξ2), N Ạ((′x1) F (x1), ξ1)),
H (Ạ((′x2) (∃x1) D (x2, x1), ξ2), N Ạ((′x1) C (x1), ξ1))).
The following proof shows that exclusively syllogistic rules can be brought into
play to make clear the validity of this inference.
Proof:

A ((′x1) F (x1), (′x1) C (x1))

H (I ((′x2) (∃x1) D (x2, x1), ξ2), N Ạ((′x1) C (x1), ξ1)))

Second example:
All circles are figures.
Thus: if, when something is a figure a has not drawn it, then, when something is a circle, a
has not drawn it.
Symbolically:
A ((′x) F (x), (′x) C (x))
∴H (H (I ((′x) F (x), ξ1), N Ạ((′x) D (a, x), ξ1)),
H (I ((′x) C (x), ξ1), N Ạ((′x) D (a, x), ξ1))).

As the example just discussed shows, it is not yet the mere use of functional signs
which leads to an expansion of the domain of deductive logic that breaks open the
limits of the syllogistic. As will be seen further below, and especially after § 72, we
overstep these limits only when we abandon our practice up to now of only accept-
ing such rules which are valid on the basis of definitions alone.
§ 67 Abbreviation Rules
If one assumes the conventions recommended in §§ 64 and 65, syllogistic expressions
can be transformed according to the following rules in such a way that, both concept
variables and conceptual constants become superfluous as required descriptive signs
and the signs for conceptual relations are dispensable as logical constants:
1. Abbreviation for a formula for a singular categorical proposition:
Ạ((′v) A (v), ζ) ≻≺[A (t)]
(V. 1)
2. Abbreviation for a formula for a universal categorical proposition:
A ((′v) A (v), ξ) ≻≺(∀v) A (v)
(V. 2)
Section Five Contentful Syllogistic Inference § 67
267

3. Abbreviation for a formula for a particular categorical proposition:
I ((′v) A (v), ξ) ≻≺(∃v) A (v)
(V. 3)
4. Abbreviation for a formula for a singular categorical proposition:
Ạ((′v) A (v), ξ) ≻≺(∇v) A (v)
(V. 4)
The validity of these eight rules follows directly from the comments given in § 65
and the notation introduced in § 64. Since, according to these comments, quantifiers
are not truly logical constants, but rather only signs that abbreviate syllogistic ex-
pressions of a certain quantity, these rules should not be regarded as principles, but
rather as transformation rules, which serve merely to abbreviate syllogistic expres-
sions for certain categorical propositions with complex predicate expressions.
§ 68 Examples of Contentful Syllogistic Inference (Continued)
We have seen in § 66 that the validity of the inference
All circles are figures.
Thus: if someone draws something that is not a figure, then someone draws something that is
not a circle.
is provable according to syllogistic rules, if one presents it in the following form:
A ((′x1) F (x1), (′x1) C (x1))
∴H (H (I ((′x1) (∃x2) D (x2, x1), ξ1), N Ạ((′x1) F (x1), ξ1)),
H (Ạ((′x1) (∃x2) D (x2, x1), ξ1), N Ạ((′x1) C (x1), ξ1))).
According to the transformation rules listed in § 67, the conclusion of this infer-
ence can now be transformed and abbreviated, and this in such a way that all the
concept variables, conceptual constants, and expressions for conceptual relations
that appear in it disappear. For the expression ‘I ((′x1) (∃x2) D (x2, x1), ξ1)’ we may
substitute ‘(∃x) (∃y) D (y, x)’. For ‘Ạ((′x1) C (x1), ξ1)’ and ‘Ạ((′x1) F (x1), ξ1)’, we can
insert the expressions ‘(∇x) C (x)’ and ‘(∇x) F (x)’. We then get:
H (H ((∃x) (∃y) D (y, x), N (∇x) F (x)), H ((∃x) (∃y) D (y, x), N (∇x) C (x)).
One can also arrive at this formula by applying rules (V. 3) and (V. 4) to the last
line of the derivation from § 66.
In just the same way, we can now also present the inference
268
Part II Section Five Contentful Syllogistic Inference

All circles are figures.
Thus: if, when something is a figure a has not drawn it, then, when something is a circle, a
has not drawn it.
by writing:
A ((′x) F (x), (′x) C (x))
∴H (H ((∃x) F (x), N (∇x) D (a, x)),
H ((∃x) C (x), N (∇x) D (a, x))).
If in addition we want to avoid the use of the signs ‘(∇x) . . .’ and ‘(′x) . . .’, then
we must, with the example inferences considered here, alter both the logical
form of the premises as well as the logical form of the conclusions. This can be
done, for example, first by weakening the categorical form as it appears in the
premises to a hypothetical form and, second, by replacing the bound variables as
they appear in the conclusions in all places with the same individual constant. In
this way, the inference just considered becomes this one:
If something is a circle, then it is a figure;
Therefore: if a, when b is a figure, has not drawn b, then a, when b is a circle, has not drawn b.
or into the inference:
If b is a circle, then b is a figure;
Therefore: if a, when b is a figure, has not drawn b, then a, when b is a circle, has not drawn b.
An inference of this form can also be proven with the syllogistic method of deri-
vation. It has the symbolic form:
H ([C (b)], [F (b)])
∴H (H ([F (b)], N [D (a, b)], H ([C (b)], N [D (a, b)])).
Its validity can be proven as follows:
Proof:
[1] H (Ạ((′x) C (x), ζ2), Ạ((′x) F (x), ζ2)),
H (Ạ((′x) F (x), ζ2), N Ạ((′x) D (a, x), ζ2))
∴H (Ạ((′x) C (x), ζ2), N Ạ((′x) D (a, x), ζ2))
(II. 13)
[2] H (Ạ((′x) C (x), ζ2), Ạ((′x) F (x), ζ2))
∴H (H (Ạ((′x) F (x), ζ2), N Ạ((′x) D (a, x), ζ2)),
H (Ạ((′x) C (x), ζ2), N Ạ((′x) D (a, x), ζ2))
(II. 1) [1]
Section Five Contentful Syllogistic Inference § 68
269

By substituting ‘[D (a, b)]’, ‘[K (b)]’, and ‘[F (b)]’ for ‘Ạ((′x) D (a, x), ζ2)’, ‘Ạ((′x) C (x), ζ2)’,
and ‘Ạ((′x) F (x), ζ2)’ in line [2] of this derivation, we get the following formula
H ([C (b)], [F (b)])
∴H (H ([F (b)], N [D (a, b)], H ([C (b)], N [D (a, b)])).
We get this formula by applying the transformation rule (V. 1) from § 67 to line [2].
§ 69 Further Abbreviation Rules
We can gain more than the transformation rules of § 67 from the conventions of §
65. They govern the manner of notation for syllogistic expressions in such a way
that further derivation rules can be formulated with them. According to the explana-
tion of the concept expression ‘(′v) A (v)’ in § 65 (3) and the comment on § 65, concept
expressions of the type ‘(′x) A (x)’ are, unlike expressions of the type ‘(′x) F (x)’, inde-
terminate in such a way that they can play the same role as concept variables α, β,
etc. We can thus say that α, β, etc. can substantially play the role of abbreviating
expressions of the type ‘(′v) A (v)’, ‘(′v) B (v)’, etc. In just the same way, the concept
expressions ‘(′v) N A (v)’, ‘(′v) N B (v)’, etc. can be represented by the equivalent
briefer concept expressions Nα, Nβ, etc. Hence, the expressions Y ((′v) A (v), β)
and Y ((′v) N A (v), β), with Y equal to A, I, or Ạ, differ only by their manner of
notation from the expressions Y (α, β) und Y (Nα, β). Because of this equivalence
in meaning, the following rules hold:
Y ((′v) A (v), β) ≻≺Y (α, β) (with Y = A, I, or Ạ)
(V. 5)
Y ((′v) N A (v), β) ≻≺Y (Nα, β) (with Y = A, I, or Ạ)
(V. 6)
These rules are to be considered as abbreviation rules as well.
According to § 53, the rules (III. 8) to (III. 10) hold for expressions of the form
A (Nα, β), I (Nα, β), and Ạ(Nα, β), in sequence. From the application of rules (V. 5)
and (V. 6) to these three rules, rules (V. 7) to (V. 9) result:
A ((′v) N A (v), β) ≺N I ((′v) A (v), β)
(V. 7)
I ((′v) N A (v), β) ≺N A ((′v) A (v), β)
(V. 8)
Ạ((′v) N A (v), β) ≺N Ạ((′v) A (v), β)
(V. 9)
