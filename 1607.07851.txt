ABSTRACT
Context. Investigations into the substructure of massive star forming regions are essential for understanding the observed relationships
between core mass distributions and mass distributions in stellar clusters, diﬀerentiating between proposed mechanisms of massive
star formation.
Aims. We study the substructure in the two largest fragments (i.e. cores) MM1 and MM2, in the infrared dark cloud complex SDC13.
As MM1 appears to be in a later stage of evolution than MM2, comparing their substructure provides an insight in to the early
evolution of massive clumps.
Methods. We report the results of high resolution SMA dust continuum observations towards MM1 and MM2. Combining these data
with Herschel observations, we carry out RADMC-3D radiative transfer modelling to characterise the observed substructure.
Results. SMA continuum data indicates 4 sub-fragments in the SDC13 region. The nature of the second brightest sub-fragment (B)
is uncertain as it does not appear as prominent at the lower MAMBO resolution or at radio wavelengths. Statistical analysis indicates
that it is unlikely to be a background source, an AGB star, or the free-free emission of a HII region. It is plausible that B is a runaway
object ejected from MM1. MM1, which is actively forming stars, consists of two sub-fragments A and C. This is conﬁrmed by
70µm Herschel data. While MM1 and MM2 appear quite similar in previous low resolution observations, at high resolution, the sub-
fragment at the centre of MM2 (D) is much fainter than sub-fragment at the centre of MM1 (A). RADMC-3D models of MM1 and
MM2 are able to reproduce these results, modelling MM2 with a steeper density proﬁle and higher mass than is required for MM1.
The relatively steep density proﬁle of MM2 depends on a signiﬁcant temperature decrease in its centre, justiﬁed by the lack of star
formation in MM2. A ﬁnal stellar population for MM1 was extrapolated, indicating a star formation eﬃciency typical of regions of
core and cluster formation.
Conclusions. The proximity of MM1 and MM2 suggests they were formed at the similar times, however, despite having a larger
mass and steeper density proﬁle, the absence of stars in MM2 indicates that it is in an earlier stage of evolution than MM1. This
suggests that the density proﬁles of such cores become shallower as they start to form stars and that evolutionary timescales are not
solely dependent on initial mass. Some studies also indicate that the steep density proﬁle of MM2 makes it more likely to form a
single massive central object, highlighting the importance of the initial density proﬁle in determining the fragmentation behaviour in
massive star forming regions.

1. Introduction
A complete understanding of the relationship between the distri-
bution of density peaks in regions of high-mass star formation
(i.e. the core mass function, CMF) and the distribution of stellar
masses in clusters, the initial mass function, IMF (e.g. Könyves
et al. 2010; Alves et al. 2007) may provide an insight in to the
mechanisms responsible for the formation of massive stars (e.g.
Goodwin et al. 2007).
In order to compare the CMF and IMF in a star forming re-
gion, we must be able to accurately characterise its substructure
i.e. the level of fragmentation it contains. Studying fragmenta-
tion in high mass star forming regions requires high resolution
observations of the earliest stages of massive star formation (e.g.
Beuther & Schilke 2004; Zhang et al. 2009; Swift 2009; Bon-
temps et al. 2010; Wang et al. 2011, 2014). The earliest evolu-
tionary stages of high mass protostars are diﬃcult to identify,
but have characteristics consistent with those seen in massive
infrared dark clouds (IRDCs). These IRDCs are cold (10–20K;
Pillai et al. 2006; Ragan et al. 2011), dense regions within giant
molecular clouds (with column densities > 1022cm−2; Peretto
& Fuller 2009), manifesting themselves as regions of extinc-
tion against the mid-IR emission from the galactic plane (e.g.
Peretto & Fuller 2009). Here we investigate sub-fragmentation
in SDC13, a region comprising 3 Spitzer IRDCs from the Peretto
& Fuller (2009) catalogue (SDC13.174-0.07, SDC13.158-0.073,
SDC13.194-0.073) at a distance of 3.6kpc (Peretto et al. 2014).
Peretto & Fuller (2009) use the term fragment to describe
local peaks in column density between contours of 8µm opac-
ity for the IRDCs in their catalogue (see Appendix A in

Peretto & Fuller 2009). They ﬁnd 18 fragments in extinction
in SDC13. IRAM 30m MAMBO (Max- Planck-Millimeter-
Bolometer) 1.2mm dust continuum observations towards SDC13
indicate fragments of a similar size and position to those seen in
extinction, however, the map is dominated by two comparatively
large fragments, MM1 and MM2 (see Table 2 below and Peretto
et al. 2014). Based on the size of MM1 and MM2 (∼a few times
0.1pc), we consider the term fragment to be analogous to the
term core, and will refer to MM1 and MM2 as such. MM1 is
not seen in extinction and is associated with 8µm emission, in-
dicative of active star formation. MM2 shows no evidence of star
formation activity, lacking both 8µm emission and 24µm emis-
sion (associated with warm dust), making it a good candidate for
a massive prestellar core (Figure 1).
In this paper we investigate the substructure in MM1 and
MM2 using high angular resolution (< 3′′) observations at mil-
limetre wavelengths (Section 2). This is achieved using the Sub-
millimeter Array (SMA1; Ho et al. 2004), an 8-element radio
interferometer located at the summit of Mauna Kea in Hawaii,
to obtain 1.3mm continuum observations of MM1 and MM2
(Section 3). The aim is to gain an insight into the mechanisms
responsible for massive star formation. As MM2 appears to be
in an earlier stage of evolution than MM1, a comparison of the
substructure of MM1 and MM2 may also provide an insight into
the early evolution of massive stars and star clusters.
2. SMA Observations and Data Reduction
Observations were performed using 6 antennas of the SMA at
230 GHz. At this frequency the FWHM of the primary beam is
∼55′′. Both the extended array conﬁguration and compact array
conﬁguration were utilised on the 8th March 2012 and the 30th
June 2012 respectively. An overview of the observing parame-
ters and the maximum spatial scales that each conﬁguration is
sensitive to are given in Table 1. We observed two overlapping
ﬁelds, centred on MM1 and MM2.
The calibration of the visibility data was performed using
MIR, a software package written in IDL for the purpose of re-
ducing SMA data. A time-dependent phase and gain calibration
was carried out using quasars 1733-130 and 1743-038 for obser-
vations in both the compact and extended conﬁgurations. Obser-
vations in the lower sideband (LSB) cover the frequency range
216.8-220.8 GHz, and in the upper sideband (USB) 228.8-232.8
GHz. There is a uniform spectral resolution of 0.84 MHz (∼1.1
km s−1).
For observations in the extended conﬁguration, the quasar
3c279 was used as the band-pass calibrator; Mars was used to
calibrate the ﬂux, and the observed system temperature (Tsys)
varies from 150-200 K. For observations in the compact conﬁg-
uration, Uranus was used to calibrate both the band-pass and the
ﬂux, and 120K < Tsys < 220K.
After calibration, the visibility data were exported to the ra-
dio interferometry data reduction package MIRIAD (Multichan-
nel Image Reconstruction, Image Analysis and Display, Sault
et al. 1995) for further processing and image production. Spec-
tral line and continuum data were separated, and line-free con-
tinuum data from both antenna conﬁgurations in both sidebands
were combined for each pointing. In this paper we present results
from continuum observations only.

The continuum map shown in Figure 2 is a linear mosaic
of the pointings towards MM1 and MM2, corrected for primary
beam attenuation. The mosaic was produced using the linmos
command in MIRIAD with the taper option selected. This at-
tempts to counteract excessive noise ampliﬁcation at the edge
of the mosaic to produce uniform noise across the whole im-
age (see Sault et al. 1996). The data used combines observations
in the upper and lower side band for both the compact and ex-
tended conﬁgurations for each pointing. With natural weighting,
the map has a synthesised beam with dimensions 3.73′′ × 2.52′′,
position angle (P.A.)≈41.55◦, and a 1σ rms of ∼1 mJy.
3. SMA 1.3mm Continuum Image
The 1.3mm continuum emission towards MM1 and MM2 is
shown in Figure 2. We use the term sub-fragment to describe
the substructures we ﬁnd within MM1 and MM2 (which is
analogous to the term condensation, often used to describe the
0.01 pc-scale structures within cores). If we allow sub-fragment
boundaries to be deﬁned by 3σ contours, we ﬁnd that MM1 and
MM2 consist of a total of four sub-fragments, which we have la-
belled A, B, C, D. Table 2 gives the J2000 coordinates and some
of the physical properties calculated for A, B, C and D.
Sub-fragment dimensions a×b of subfragments A and D
were estimated based on the 3σ contours in the 1.3mm con-
tinuum map (Figure 2). The position angles (PA) of A and D
were determined by ﬁtting each with a 2-D gaussian using the
Pick Object function in GAIA (Graphical Astronomy and Im-
age Analysis Tool, part of the Starlink astronomical software
package). For the weaker subfragments C and D, we estimate
diameters to be 4 ± 1′′.
The integrated and maximum ﬂux value for each sub-
fragment was determined by performing aperture photometry
on the 1.3mm continuum image. This was carried out using the
imstat function in MIRIAD. Assuming a typical dust tempera-
ture of 15K (e.g. see Rathborne et al. 2007; Peretto et al. 2014),
the mass for each sub-fragment can then be estimated from its
integrated ﬂux using:
M =
Fνd2
Bν(Tdust)κν
,
(1)
where Fν = the integrated ﬂux at frequency ν, d is the distance
to the source (≈3.6kpc) and Bν = the Planck function at a dust
temperature Tdust. The opacity at ν is calculated using
κν = 10(ν/1.2THz)βcm2g−1
(2)
(Hildebrand 1983), with β= 1.5 (see Wang et al. 2011), such that
κ1.3mm = 0.8cm2g−1. The masses of MM1 and MM2 given in Ta-
ble 4 of Peretto et al. (2014) were calculated from the 1.2mm
MAMBO integrated ﬂux, assuming a temperature of 15K for
MM1 and 12K for MM2, and an opacity κ1.2mm = 0.5cm2g−1.
Thus we apply conversion factors of 0.6 and 0.5 respectively, to

obtain the masses for MM1 and MM2 as quoted in Table 2, al-
lowing a more accurate comparison to the masses we calculate
for A, B, C and D.
We obtain masses of 46.8 M⊙and 40.6 M⊙for MM1 and
MM2 respectively. These are similar to average core masses
found in previous studies of massive star forming regions (e.g.
Motte et al. 2007; Rathborne et al. 2006; Zhang et al. 2009). The
masses of sub-fragments A, B, C and D in SDC13 range from
∼2–12M⊙. These should be considered lower limits as they have
not been rescaled to take in to account the ﬁltering of extended
emission at 1.3mm (e.g. see Bontemps et al. 2010; Duarte-Cabral
et al. 2013), although this is not likely to be a large eﬀect as
the sources are close to unresolved. The sub-fragment masses
we obtain are in agreement with those obtained by Wang et al.
(2011) for sub-fragments in the the star forming region G28.34
(1.4-10.6M⊙).
In Figure 3, the contours from the SMA 1.3mm continuum
observations are overlayed on single dish MAMBO 1.2mm con-
tinuum data, obtained using the IRAM 30m telescope (Peretto
et al. 2014).
Three of the sub-fragments A, C, and D appear to be as-
sociated with MM1 and MM2. Sub-fragment B appears to be
associated with the slight extension between MM1 and MM2.
However, whilst it has a mass approaching that of the bright-
est sub-fragment A (Table 2), it is much less prominent in the
MAMBO data, indicating that it is not associated with a signiﬁ-
cant extended envelope of emission. In addition, while it appears
that sub-fragment B is close to the position of source MM18 in
Figure 1 of Peretto et al. (2014), the distance between the peak
of B and MM18 is larger than its 2′′ position uncertainty. Neither
does it correspond to any peak in JVLA NH3 data (Williams et
al., in prep.). In Section 4 we investigate possible candidates to
explain the appearance of sub-fragment B.
Two of the sub-fragments A and C coincide with MM1, with
the brightest of the two, sub-fragment A, at its peak. This could
be indicative of fragmentation in MM1. We further investigate
this possibility using images from the Herschel Infrared Galac-
tic Plane Survey (Hi-GAL, Molinari et al. 2010, Section 5).
Sub-fragment D coincides with the peak of MM2, however,
whereas MM1 and MM2 are of similar size and ﬂux at 1.2mm
(Table 2), sub-fragment D is ∼5 times fainter than sub-fragment
A at 1.3mm. An object similar to MM2 is seen in the molecular
cloud complex Cygnus X. In their MAMBO survey of Cygnus
X, Motte et al. (2007) ﬁnd a 1.2mm mass of 100 M⊙for the
massive cloud core CygX-N40, yet in further studies using the
higher resolution of the PdBI (Bontemps et al. 2010; Duarte-
Cabral et al. 2013) CygX-N40 is barely detectable. This result
is attributed to the ﬁltering of extended emission at 1.3mm. The
absence of a star in MM2 indicates that it is in an earlier stage of
evolution than MM1 which might suggest a more diﬀuse phys-
ical structure, providing a possible explanation for the missing
ﬂux at 1.3mm.
We aim to further understand the physical diﬀerences that
give rise to such observational diﬀerences at higher resolutions.
We use RADMC-3D, a software package designed for astro-
physical radiative transfer calculations in 1-D, 2-D and 3-D ge-
ometries (Dullemond 2012) to model MAMBO 1.2mm obser-
vations of MM1 and MM2 (Section 6) and use the CASA data
reduction software (McMullin et al. 2007) to process the result-
ing images and simulate our SMA 1.3mm observations (Section
7).
4. Sub-fragment B
Sub-fragment B, seen in the SMA data, has a mass (based on its
1.3mm ﬂux) approaching that of sub-fragment A, and yet it is

Notes. M1.2mm is the mass of MM1 and MM2 (extracted from Peretto et al. 2014) and multiplied by a conversion factor (see text). R is the
deconvolved radius of MM1 and MM2 as calculated by Peretto et al. (2014). a×b is the non-deconvolved size of A, B, C and D; PA is the position
angle, Fpeak is the peak ﬂux at 1.3mm, Fint is the 1.3mm integrated ﬂux, and M1.3mm is the total 1.3mm mass of A, B, C and D. The equivalent

much less prominent in the MAMBO data, indicating that it is
not associated with a signiﬁcant extended envelope of emission.
We consider the possibility that sub-fragment B is a background
source, an AGB star, the free-free emission of a HII region, or a
runaway object.
Maloney et al. (2005) performed a ﬂuctuation analysis on
data from the 1.1mm Bolocam Lockman Hole Survey in order
to constrain the slope and amplitude of the number count dis-
tribution of high redshift galaxies at λ=1.1mm. They ﬁnd the
best-ﬁtting power-law model to have an index δ = 2.7, a diﬀer-
ential number density at 1 mJy n0 ≈1595 mJy−1deg2, and an
integrated number density N(>1 mJy)≈940. These three param-
eters are related by,
n0 = (δ−1)N(> S )S δ−1,
(3)
where S is the peak ﬂux density. The peak ﬂux density of B is
SB ∼12 mJy (Table 2). Applying Equation 3, we ﬁnd that N(>12
mJy)≈13.7. Based on the SMA beamsize, and the overlap of
the two pointings, our observations cover an area of ≈0.0003
degrees2. The probability of ﬁnding a background source within
this region is ∼0.004. Therefore, it is unlikely that B is back-
ground source.
Object B is not listed in any AGB catalogues and, since
its angular diameter (see Table 2) makes it too large to be an
AGB star unless it resides within a few parsecs of the Earth (e.g.
Villaver & Livio 2007), it is highly unlikely that it is yet to be
identiﬁed. Using the surface density of dust envelope AGB stars
in the solar neighbourhood, calculated by Olivier et al. (2001),

we calculate the probability of ﬁnding an AGB star within the
region observed to be ∼5.7 × 10−5.
In order to determine whether B could be the result of emis-
sion from a HII region, we looked at a 5GHz radio continuum
image of the SDC13 region obtained by the VLA CORNISH
survey. The rms noise in the images is <0.4 mJy beam−1, which
would allow detection of an unresolved UCHII region around a
B0 star at 16 kpc (Purcell et al. 2013). Source B is not associ-
ated with any CORNISH radio source, so it can not explained by
emission from a HII region.
One further possibility is that B is a runaway object that
has been ejected from MM1, and its continuum emission arises
from a circumstellar disk. About 40% of O stars and ∼10% of B
stars are thought to be runaways, and the ejection of stellar em-
bryos from star forming regions, via many body interactions in
clustered environments (the dynamical ejection scenario, DES;
Poveda et al. 1967), has been proposed as a method of brown
dwarf formation (e.g. Bate 2009). Assuming a DES for B, we
can estimate its potential ejection velocity based on its distance
from the centre of MM1 (i.e. its distance from sub-fragment A)
and the approximate time since ejection. A lower limit on the
distance between A and B can be obtained from their observed
separation on the sky. This is ∼28′′, equivalent to ∼1.5×1018cm
at a distance of 3.6kpc. An upper limit on the time since ejection
is equivalent to their formation timescale (∼105 years for mas-
sive prestellar/protostellar objects). Based on these values, we
thus calculate a lower limit for the hypothetical ejection velocity
of B of ∼5kms−1. The expected escape velocities for O/B run-
aways are ∼200–400kms−1 ( e.g. Gvaramadze et al. 2009). Based
on our calculated lower limit for the velocity of sub-fragment B
it is plausible that it B is a runaway object.
5. Herschel Hi-GAL Observations
Figure 5 shows Hi-GAL images at 350, 250, 160 and 70µm, ob-
served towards SDC13. The 160µm Hi-GAL ﬂux peaks at A,
and the 70µm ﬂux peaks over A and C, indicative of star forma-
tion activity in this region. Conversely, sub-fragment D is dark in
the Hi-GAL 70µm images. This would suggest that D does not
contain any embedded sources and may therefore be in an earlier
stage of evolution than A and C.
The SMA continuum data (Figure 2) indicates that MM1
consists of two sub-fragments (A and C). However, A and C ap-
pear unresolved in the Herschel observations at all wavelengths.

Notes. Data was extracted from 70µm Herschel observations of MM1
using the Hyper algorithm (Traﬁcante et al. 2015).
At 70µm, Hi-GAL observations show an elongated source cov-
ering the positions of A and C. The resolution of the image is
insuﬃcient, however, to conﬁrm whether this elongated source
is the result of emission from two objects.
Source extraction was performed at all Hi-GAL wavelengths
with the Hyper (Hybrid Photometry and Extraction Routine) al-
gorithm (Traﬁcante et al. 2015). Hyper is an enhanced version
of classical aperture photometry, designed to take into account
the strong background variability and source crowding typical
of Galactic observations. Sources are modelled with 2-D Gaus-
sians, allowing the FWHM to vary between 1 and 2 times the in-
strumental PSF. The background is subtracted automatically by
Hyper. It estimates several backgrounds, modelled with polyno-
mials of diﬀerent orders, and chooses the best background model
based on which results in the lowest residuals. The ﬂux is esti-
mated within a 2-D Gaussian region with aperture radii equal to
the Gaussians FWHM (Traﬁcante et al. 2015). Hyper identiﬁed
2 sources at 70µm, Her1 and Her2. The results of the source ex-
traction and photometry for Her1 and Her2 are shown in Table
3.
The initial parameters for our RADMC-3D models of MM1
and MM2 (Section 6) are derived based on an SED ﬁt to Hi-
GAL observations towards MM1 at 160, 250 and 350 µm, as-
suming a distance to SDC13 of d ≃3.6 kpc. We use an el-
liptical aperture with axes equal to the FWHMs derived from
a 2-D Gaussian ﬁt at 250 µm. The SED ﬁt is performed us-
ing a single-temperature greybody model with ﬁxed β=1.5,
and temperature and mass as free parameters. The results of
the ﬁt are shown in Figure 4. We ﬁnd an MM1 luminosity
LHi−GAL = 1080L⊙, radius RHi−GAL = 1.93 × 1018cm (∼0.6 pc)
and core mass MHi−GAL = 243M⊙(equivalent to a dust mass
Mdust = 2.43M⊙, assuming a gas:dust mass ratio of 100:1). We
used the physical properties of MM1 derived from this SED to
model MAMBO observations of MM1 and MM2 (Section 6).
6. Modelling with RADMC-3D
Using RADMC-3D, we model the dust continuum emission of
MM1 and MM2 with 1-D logarithmically spaced, spherically
symmetric models with inner radii Rin = 1 × 1016cm (based
on typical values for best-ﬁt models to high-mass cores given
in Table 5 of Williams et al. 2005). This corresponds to ∼0.2′′ at
the distance of SDC13. Our initial estimates for the outer radius
(Rout = 1.93 × 1018cm) of our model dust clouds and the total
dust mass (Mdust = 2.4M⊙) are based on the SED ﬁt to the Hi-
GAL data for MM1 (Section 5). We use dust opacities calculated
by Ossenkopf & Henning (1994) for coagulated dust grains with
thin ice mantles, at a gas density of 105 cm−3 and a Draine &
Lee (1984) dust grain size distribution.
Spitzer MIPSGAL observations of the IRDC SDC13 indi-
cate a 24µm source at the centre of MM1, indicating the pres-
ence of a central star (or multiple system). There is no evidence
of such a source at the centre of MM2 (Figure 1). The eﬀect of
including a stellar source at the centre of our models is there-
fore investigated. We cannot rule out the presence of a multi-
ple system at the centre of MM1, however for simplicity we use
a single object at the centre of our models. We base the lumi-
nosity of the central star (L⋆= 1080L⊙) on the luminosity of
MM1, which is derived from the Hi-GAL data (Section 5). We
estimate the contribution of the dust emission to the total lu-
minosity (in the absence of a star) using a modiﬁed blackbody
function (e.g. see Battersby et al. 2011) at a temperature of 15
K, normalised to the MM1 1.2mm MAMBO ﬂux. We ﬁnd a
contribution of ∼14L⊙from dust emission, which is negligible
compared to the total luminosity. The remaining stellar proper-
ties (mass M⋆= 7.36M⊙, radius R⋆= 4.94R⊙and temperature
T⋆= 14914 K, corresponding to a class B ZAMS star) are cal-
culated using typical relationships between the luminosity, mass,
radius and temperature of main sequence stars (Schulz 2012).
For prestellar cores (without a central source), the domi-
nant source of radiation will be external. To account for this,
we include an external radiation ﬁeld in our models based on the
ISRF in the solar neighbourhood. Our models cover wavelengths
0.01 ≤λ ≤1000µm, therefore our model ISRF covers emission
in this range, incorporating contributions from the cosmic mi-
crowave background (CMB), infrared emission from dust, and
photons of starlight (Draine 2011).
The earliest models of core collapse describe isolated spher-
ical cores which are pressure bounded, isothermal and non-
fragmenting i.e. Bonnor-Ebert (BE) spheres (Bonnor 1956;
Ebert 1955). For a critical BE sphere on the verge of gravita-
tional collapse, there are a family of solutions corresponding to
spheres with diﬀerent initial density distributions. Each consist
of a uniform density central core (whose size and density varies
with temperature) and an outer envelope with density ρ ∝r−2
(where r is the radius). At one extreme of this group of models is
the Shu (1977) solution, which describes the inside-out collapse
of a singular isothermal sphere (SIS) i.e. a sphere with inﬁnite
central density and ρ ∝r−2. At the other extreme of the fam-
ily of BE spheres, the Larson-Penston solution (Larson 1969;
Penston 1969) describes the collapse of a cloud with uniform
density, that acquires large infall velocities at all radii.
During the inside-out collapse of a SIS, described by Shu
et al. (1987), the density increases fastest in central regions, with
collapse occurring ﬁrst at the centre and then propagating out-
wards via an expansion wave (Shu 1977). The result of the col-
lapse is an infalling central region in free-fall collapse (ρ ∝r−1.5)
surrounded by a static envelope (retaining the isothermal density
distribution (ρ ∝r−2). Other theoretical models invoke diﬀer-
ent density proﬁles at various points during the process of col-
lapse (e.g. Foster & Chevalier 1993; Basu & Mouschovias 1994;
Whitworth & Ward-Thompson 2001), however, Foster & Cheva-
lier (1993) found that following the formation of the central pro-
tostar, density proﬁles tend towards those seen for SISs. More
recently, based on numerical simulations of core and protostar
formation in supersonic ﬂows, Gong & Ostriker (2009, 2011)
ﬁnd the ρ ∝r−2 density proﬁle to be an attractor for the collapse
of a molecular cloud core at the point of protostar formation, re-
gardless of the mechanism responsible for the collapse. Similar
results have been found for models of massive cores (Tilley &
Pudritz 2004).
Observations of low mass star forming regions (e.g. Young
et al. 2003) show core density proﬁles ρ ∝rα with −2.0 ≤α ≤
−1.5, in agreement with the predictions of models of collapsing
cores (e.g. Shu et al. 1987; Foster & Chevalier 1993). However
the density distributions of high mass cores have been more dif-

C. McGuire et al.: The structure and early evolution of massive star forming regions
ﬁcult to characterise due to the relative scarcity of massive cores
and their more complex environments. Beuther et al. (2002) pre-
sented a study on a large sample of massive star forming re-
gions and found a typical value of α = −1.6 for their density
distributions. Additional previous modelling and observations of
high mass star forming regions have found a range of density
distributions with −2.25 ≤α ≤0 (e.g. Wolﬁre & Churchwell
1994; Garay & Rodriguez 1990; Hatchell & van der Tak 2003;
Williams et al. 2005). As such, we model our spherical dust
clouds with density distributions ρ ∝rα (where −3.0 < α ≤0).
The upper limit on α is a consequence of our mass normalization
(see Equation 4).
Figure 6 compares the MAMBO 1.2mm continuum ﬂux dis-
tributions observed towards MM1 and MM2 for a range of power
law density distributions. Using the initial Hi-GAL derived es-
timate for the core radius Rout = RHi−GAL = 1.93 × 1018cm, we
obtain good ﬁt to the slope of the MAMBO 1.2mm observations
of MM1 using a model with a central source and a density dis-
tribution ρ ∝r−1.5 (model A2a). This is similar to the observed
density proﬁles of protostellar cores in low-mass star forming
regions, and is suggestive of free-fall collapse (Shu 1977; Shu
et al. 1987), consistent with infall around the central star seen in
the Spitzer data (Figure 1). In order to also ﬁt the peak of the
MM1 observations using this density distribution, we require a
model dust mass (i.e. the mass of dust only) Mdust = 2.33M⊙.
We initially modelled MM2 as a dust envelope without a cen-
tral source, with Rout = RHi−GAL. A reasonable ﬁt to the slope of
the MM2 MAMBO data is then obtained for a model with a
power law density distribution ρ ∝rα, with −2.9 < α < −2.5
(models D3a and D4a respectively). This is steeper than ex-
pected for an SIS collapse scenario. The best ﬁt models to MM2
have dust masses in the range 6.17M⊙< Mdust ≤6.49M⊙. In-
spection of the MIPSGAL images suggests there may be some
heating due to an enhanced radiation ﬁeld in this region (Figure
1). In principle this would lower the mass of MM2, but the ef-
fect would be subtle. This heating may however account for the
spread in the radial proﬁle of MM2 (e.g. see grey lines in Figure
6). The temperature and density proﬁles of the best ﬁt models
(with Rout = RHi−GAL) to MAMBO observations of MM1 and
MM2 are shown in Figure 7. This ﬁgure shows that the tem-
perature proﬁle of the best ﬁt model to MM2 drops down to
∼4 −5 K at its centre. While temperatures as low as 6 K have
been seen in some sources (e.g. Harju et al. 2008), massive star
forming regions and IRDCs are typically observed to have tem-
peratures of ∼10 −15 K. We therefore investigated the eﬀect of
setting a lower temperature proﬁle limit of 10 K on the result-
ing RADMC-3D model density proﬁles. This temperature limit
could be justiﬁed by the eﬀect of cosmic ray heating, for exam-
ple. We found than while the 10 K lower temperature limit did
result in a shallower density distribution for the best ﬁt model to
MM2 (α ∼2.0) this is still steeper than the density proﬁle found
for MM1. This ﬁxed minimum temperature did however result
in a decreased model mass of ∼230M⊙for MM2.
In an attempt to further improve the ﬁt to the MAMBO ob-
servations of MM2 we tried and successfully ﬁtted a number
of diﬀerent models to the MM2 data which correspond to a va-
riety of physical conditions. These included models with trun-
cated density distributions (expected for cold cores embedded
in warmer gas; Fischera 2014); and two-part power law den-
sity proﬁles, consistent with observations of central ﬂattening in
prestellar cores (e.g. Beuther et al. 2002; Andre et al. 2000). The
SMA data provides additional constraints on these models. In
Section 7, we describe the use of the CASA data reduction soft-
ware (McMullin et al. 2007) to process our model images and

produce SMA 1.3mm simulations to investigate if we are able to
reproduce our 1.3mm observations (Figure 2).
7. CASA Simulation of SMA Observations
Initially, the RADMC-3D models of MM1 and MM2 were added
linearly into a blank ﬁeld to create a single sky model using the
CASA imaging toolkit functions. The CASA task simobserve
was then used to generate visibility data. This created four mea-
surement sets, one for each SMA array conﬁguration at each
sideband. The date and hourangle were set such that the UTC
and date for each observation matched the true observations. The
zenith opacity was set to give Tsys values for the simulations
which matched the highest values measured in the SMA obser-
vations with each array. The on source time, comprising multiple
scans toward two pointings, matched the observed data in length.
An artiﬁcial phase calibration cycle was included such that the
time coverage of the uv-plane was as close as possible to real
observations. The measurement sets (MS) for each sideband for
each array were then concatenated together, giving a single MS.
Finally, imaging of the visibility data was carried out using
the CASA clean task in mosaic mode, with a clean box at each
source position and a threshold of ∼0.45mJy, (a mid point value
between the ∼0.3mJy for the compact data, and ∼0.6mJy for the
extended data). The cell size (0.52′′ × 0.50′′) and the restoring
beam (3.78′′ × 2.52′′, PA= 41.55◦) were ﬁxed to match the real
data image values. Examples of the results of the CASA simula-
tion process are shown in Figures 8 and 9.
Figure 8 shows the result of the CASA simulation using
models A2a and D3a (see Section 6 and Table 4). The resulting
sub-fragments A2a and D3a are of similar size and ﬂux, with
peak ﬂuxes FA2a = 1.68 mJy/beam and FD3a = 1.52 mJy/beam
respectively (i.e FA2a ∼10% larger than FD3a). In comparison,
the peak ﬂuxes of sub-fragments A and D in the SMA 1.3mm
data (coincident with MM1 and MM2 in the MAMBO data) are
FA = 13.6 mJy/beam and FD = 4.9 mJy/beam respectively i.e
FA ∼2.8 times larger than FD (see Table 2). We ﬁnd we were
able to better match the observed peak ﬂuxes FA and FD (and
therefore their ratio FA/FD) by adjusting the value of Rout in the
RADMC-3D models of MM1 and MM2.

We normalize our RADMC-3D models based on the total
dust mass Mdust, which we use to calculate a normalisation con-
stant ρ0 (the density at the outer radius Rout). For a density dis-
tribution ρ = cRα and ρ0 = cRα

A consequence of this method of normalisation is that Mdust ∝
Rout i.e. an increase/decrease in Rout in our models requires
an increase/decrease in Mdust to maintain the same density
distribution. This increase/decrease in Mdust results in an in-
crease/decrease in ﬂux from the model.
For example, as shown in Figure 9, we are better able
to match the observed ﬂuxes FA and FD with increased
outer radii for the RADMC-3D models of MM1 and MM2
(Model A2b with RA2b = 3.5 × 1018cm and Model D3b with
RD3b = 2.9 × 1018cm respectively; see Table 4). This sub-
sequently increases the model peak ﬂuxes, giving values
FA2b = 10.5mJy and FD3b = 4.2mJy resulting in a ﬂux ratio
FA2b/FD3b ∼2.5. This is similar to the ratio of the observed
ﬂuxes for sub-fragments A and D, FA/FD ∼2.8. Figure 9 in-
dicates that adjusting the model outer radii as described above
does not have a signiﬁcant eﬀect on the quality of the ﬁt to the
MAMBO observations.
Simulations performed using models of MM2 with trun-
cated and two-part power-law density proﬁles produce model
sub-fragments that are too diﬀuse to be detected. As such, we
consider models A2b and D3b to be the best-ﬁts for MM1 and
MM2 respectively, as they provide the closest match to both
the MAMBO and SMA observations. The best ﬁt model to
MM1 is therefore a cloud of total mass ∼360M⊙(assuming
gas:dust=100:1), radius Rout = RA2b = 3.5 × 1018cm and density
proﬁle r ∝ρ−1.5, with a central star of temperature T⋆= 14914K.
The best ﬁt model to MM2 has a total mass ∼824M⊙, radius
Rout = RD3b = 2.9 × 1018cm and density proﬁle r ∝ρ−2.5 and
does not contain a central star. Peretto et al. (2014) ﬁnd masses

8. Discussion and Summary
High resolution SMA 1.3mm observations toward MM1 and
MM2, the two largest fragments (i.e. cores) in SDC13 (as ob-
served with MAMBO at 1.2mm with lower resolution), indicate
the presence of 4 sub-fragments A, B, C and D (Figure 2). Three
of the sub-fragments A, C and D are associated with the cloud.
One of the sub-fragments, B, does not appear to be associated
with a signiﬁcant extended envelope and is much less prominent
in the MAMBO 1.2mm observations (Figure 3). The nature of
B remains unconﬁrmed, but statistical analysis indicates that B
is unlikely to be a background source, an AGB star or free-free
emission of a HII region. However B could plausibly be a run-
away object (see Section 4).
MM1 consists of two sub-fragments: A, at its centre and a
fainter sub-fragment C. The fragmentation of MM1 into two ob-
jects is conﬁrmed by Herschel Hi-GAL observations at 70µm
(see Figure 5). MM2 consists of only one object at its centre
(sub-fragment D). Although MM1 and MM2 look similar at the
lower MAMBO resolution, with a similar size and brightness, at
the higher resolution of the SMA, they look very diﬀerent (Fig-
ure 3), with the object at the centre of MM1 (sub-fragment A) ap-
pearing much brighter than the object at the centre of MM2 (sub-

fragment D). We are able to reproduce this eﬀect with CASA
simulations of SMA observations, using RADMC-3D models
with single power law density distributions and extended outer
radii (see Figure 9, Section 7).
MM1 is associated with 8µm emission indicative of active
star formation. MM2 shows no evidence of emission at 8µm or
24µm making it a good candidate for a prestellar core (Figure 1).
MM2 requires a steeper density proﬁle and higher mass to model
its emission (r ∝ρ−2.5; Mdust∼824M⊙) compared to those re-
quired for MM1 (r ∝ρ−1.5; Mdust∼360M⊙). The relatively steep
denisty proﬁle required to model MM2 depends on a signiﬁcant
temperature decrease at its centre (see Section 6), which can be
justiﬁed by the lack of star formation in the core. Increasing the
minimum temperature decreases the required model mass, but
for temperatures ∼10 K, MM2 still requires a steeper model
density proﬁle than MM1.
A further example of a higher-mass core at an earlier evolu-
tionary stage than a neighbouring lower-mass core, can be found
in Stephens et al. (2015).
8.1. The Future Stellar Population in SDC13
Based on our models, MM1 contains one star with a mass of
∼7.36M⊙. We can use this to estimate the possible future stel-
lar population which MM1 could produce, by assuming that the
stars will have an IMF distribution of masses, and conserva-
tively normalising the IMF to have one star in the mass range
6M⊙≤M⋆≤9M⊙. Adopting a power law form of the IMF,
dN ∝M−αdM (where 2.3 ≤α ≤2.35, Salpeter 1955; Kroupa
2002), we ﬁnd that MM1 could potentially form ∼25–26 stars
in the mass range 1M⊙≤M⋆≤120M⊙. Kroupa (2002) estimate
that stars in this mass range make up ∼6.1% of the total number
of stars in the galactic ﬁeld (for an IMF with α = 2.3). This sug-
gests that MM1 has the potential to form at least ∼409 stars in to-
tal (with masses 0.01M⊙≤M⋆≤120M⊙). Based on the average
stellar mass ( ¯m=0.38M⊙) given by Kroupa (2002), this equates
to a total stellar mass ∼155M⊙. Using the total mass of MM1
(∼360M⊙, derived from the best-ﬁt RADMC-3D model; Section
7), this is equivalent to a star formation eﬃciency of ∼43%, con-
sistent with the relatively high star formation eﬃciencies seen
in regions of dense core and cluster formation (e.g. Wilking &
Lada 1983; Hillenbrand & Hartmann 1998; Koenig et al. 2008).
MM2 might be expected to form a similar population of stars to
MM1 in the future.
8.2. The Evolution of MM1 and MM2
The absence of a star in MM2 suggests that it is in an earlier
stage of evolution than MM1. However, based on the proximity
of MM1 and MM2, one could assume that they were formed at
the same time. This would suggest a shorter evolution timescale
for MM1 than for MM2. Diﬀerences in star formation timescales
could be the result of diﬀerences in the size and density of the
region in a large scale dynamical collapse scenario (e.g. Peretto
et al. 2014) or diﬀerences in turbulent and/or magnetic support
between regions (Myers & Fuller 1993; McKee & Tan 2003).
Peretto et al. (2014) ﬁnd a slightly higher value for the velocity
dispersion in the vicinity of MM2 (σtot ∼0.84 kms−1) than in the

C. McGuire et al.: The structure and early evolution of massive star forming regions
vicinity of MM1 (σtot ∼0.81 kms−1), however the diﬀerence is
small and does not translate into enough additional support to
prevent the collapse of MM2. The slight diﬀerence in the mea-
sured velocity dispersion of the turbulent motions around MM1
and MM2 is therefore not a plausible explanation for their dif-
ferent evolutionary stages.
In order to explain the observed distribution of protostellar
and prestellar cores in the Perseus molecular cloud, Hatchell &
Fuller (2008) suggest that higher-mass prestellar cores will have
shorter evolutionary timescales. If this is the case, MM1 may
have had a larger initial mass than MM2. Based on our best ﬁt
models however, MM2 is currently ∼460M⊙more massive than
MM1 (Section 7). It is possible that MM1 could have experi-
enced mass loss after the formation of its central protostar via
accretion on to the star, but, based on our best ﬁt model, only a
small proportion of the mass diﬀerence can be accounted for in
the star at the centre of MM1 (∼7 M⊙).
A further possibility is that the observed mass diﬀerence be-
tween MM1 and MM2 is the result of outﬂows from the stars in
MM1. The three-colour image of SDC13 shown in Figure 1 indi-
cates an extended green (8.0µm) biconical structure in the vicin-
ity of MM1, characteristic of emission from PAHs excited by
UV photons. IR emission in the Spitzer IRAC bands, observed
towards regions of star formation, has been shown to trace the il-
lumination of outﬂow cavities by scattered light from central star
forming objects (Qiu et al. 2006; Tobin et al. 2007; Velusamy
et al. 2011). The presence of 8µm biconical emission around
MM1 provides evidence for the existence of a bipolar outﬂow
cavity (and therefore a bipolar outﬂow) in this region. However,
the removal of ≳460 M⊙would imply an unusually high mass
loss rate ∼5 × 10−4–5 × 10−3 M⊙yr−1 over 105–106 years, com-
pared to a typical value of ∼10−4 M⊙yr−1 for similarly sized
clumps (e.g. Zhang et al. 2005; de Villiers et al. 2014).
An alternative explanation for the mass diﬀerence between
MM1 and MM2 could be that MM2 may have continued to
increase in mass once MM1 started star formation. However,
using the mass inﬂow rate estimated by Peretto et al. (2014)
(∼2.5 × 10−5 M⊙yr−1) this would imply an age diﬀerence ∼107
years between MM1 and MM2. This is unrealistically long given
the presence of embedded young stars in MM1 and the ∼105 yr
timescale for the formation of massive stars (e.g. McKee & Tan
2002).
The density proﬁle in MM1 is consistent with that expected
for a collapsing region whereas the proﬁle of MM2 is steeper, or
at least has a steeper outer envelope. This diﬀerence may reﬂect
how a clump density proﬁle evolves as the clump evolves to-
wards forming stars. With its apparent coeval, similar mass, but
star forming, neighbouring clump in a near identical environ-
ment, MM2 is an important laboratory for further study towards
understanding how massive clumps evolve towards the forma-
tion of massive stars. The steep density proﬁle of MM2 may
also make it more likely to form a single massive central object.
This is based on evidence presented by Girichidis et al. (2011),
who ﬁnd that massive stars predominantly form from cores with
initial density proﬁles that are strongly centrally condensed (in-
dependent of support from radiation or magnetic ﬁelds). They
conclude that the initial density proﬁle of star forming cores is
perhaps the most important factor in determining the fragmenta-
tion, evolution and ﬁnal mass distribution of massive star form-
ing regions.
