Without knowledge of human cognitive processes, instructional design is blind. 
In the absence of an appropriate framework to suggest instructional techniques, we 
are likely to have difficulty explaining why instructional procedures do or do not 
work. Lacking knowledge of human cognition, we would be left with no overarching 
structure linking disparate instructional processes and guiding procedures. Unless 
we can appeal to the manner in which human cognitive structures are organised, 
known as human cognitive architecture, a rational justification for ­recommending 
one instructional procedure over another is unlikely to be available. At best, we 
would be restricted to using narrow, empirical grounds indicating that particular 
procedures seem to work. We could say instructional procedure A seems better than 
procedure B but why it works, the conditions under which it works or how we can 
make it work even better would be rendered unanswerable and mysterious.
In contrast, knowledge of how we learn, think and solve problems – human 
cognitive architecture – can provide us with a coherent, unifying base that can be 
used to generate instructional hypotheses and data. That base can explain why some 
instructional procedures work while others fail. Seemingly disparate, even contra-
dictory data can be explained and reconciled. Most importantly, human cognitive 
architecture can be used to generate instructional procedures that we otherwise 
would have considerable difficulty conceiving. The structures that constitute the 
framework of human cognitive architecture provide an essential prerequisite to 
instructional design for both researchers and professional educators. Those struc-
tures allow us to make sense of instructional design issues. Further, we can use our 
knowledge of human cognitive architecture to devise instructional theories.
One such theory is cognitive load theory that was explicitly developed as a the-
ory of instructional design based on our knowledge of human cognitive architec-
ture. Cognitive load theory consists of aspects of human cognitive architecture that 
are relevant to instruction along with the instructional consequences that flow from 
the architecture. This book begins by considering categories of knowledge in Part  
I, human cognitive architecture in Part II, categories of cognitive load in Part III, 
followed by the instructional effects that flow from these theoretical considerations 
in Part IV and the conclusions in Part V.
Preface

Preface
In recent years, the cognitive architecture used by cognitive load theory has 
been expanded and anchored within a biological evolutionary framework. 
Evolution by natural selection has a dual role in cognitive load theory. First, as 
indicated in Chapter 1 of Part I, we can classify information into two categories. 
The first category, known as biologically primary knowledge, consists of informa-
tion that we have specifically evolved to acquire while the second category, known 
as biologically secondary knowledge, is information that we need for cultural 
reasons but have not specifically evolved to acquire. Educational institutions were 
devised to facilitate the acquisition of biologically secondary information and 
cognitive load theory deals almost exclusively with that category of information. 
Chapter 1, by analysing these distinct categories of knowledge, provides an intro-
duction to the evolutionary base used by cognitive load theory.
Evolution by natural selection has a second, equally important role in cognitive 
load theory. Evolutionary theory is usually considered as a biological theory 
explaining how biological structures, including entire species, arose. That function 
is, of course, the primary purpose of evolutionary theory. Nevertheless, evolution-
ary theory can be considered from an entirely different perspective, as a natural 
information processing system. By thinking of evolutionary theory in terms of the 
manner in which information is processed, we can extend evolutionary concepts to 
other information processing systems such as human cognition.
Biological evolution is not normally considered in information processing terms 
but there are advantages to thinking of it in this way. When considered as an infor-
mation processing system, biological evolution is able to tell us about a particular 
class of theories, natural information processing theories. These theories tell us how 
information is processed in nature and evolution by natural selection provides us 
with the best known and most detailed natural information processing theory. By 
treating biological evolution as a natural information processing theory, we can 
throw substantial light on the characteristics of this class of information processing 
systems because of the large amount of knowledge that we have available to us 
about biological evolution.
Knowing how natural information processing systems such as biological evolu-
tion function is particularly important because human cognition provides another 
example of a natural information processing system. If we know how biological 
evolution functions as a natural information processing system, that knowledge can 
be used to tell us how human cognition functions because human cognition also is 
a natural information processing system, analogous to evolution by natural selec-
tion. Knowing the characteristics of natural information processing systems in 
general can tell us about some of the central characteristics of human cognition.
Thus, if we know how biological evolution works, it may tell us much about 
how human cognition works, assuming both are natural information processing 
systems. If we assume the way we learn, think and solve problems is part of nature 
because we are part of nature, we need to know how nature learns and solves 
problems. That aim can be achieved by treating both evolution by natural selection 
and human cognition as a natural information processing system. Chapters 2–4 of 
Part II establish and discuss the suggested analogy between evolution by natural 

vii
Preface
selection and human cognition. In the process, those chapters provide the cognitive 
architecture that lies at the heart of cognitive load theory.
Cognitive load theory’s emphasis on human cognitive architecture and its evolu-
tion is not an end in itself. The ultimate aim of the theory is to use our knowledge 
of human cognition to provide instructional design principles. The cognitive archi-
tecture discussed in Part II tells us that when processing biologically secondary 
information, human cognition includes a working memory that is limited in capac-
ity and duration if dealing with novel information but unlimited in capacity and 
duration if dealing with familiar information previously stored in a very large long-
term memory. Instruction needs to consider the limitations of working memory so 
that information can be stored effectively in long-term memory. Once appropriate 
information is stored in long-term memory, the capacity and duration limits of 
working memory are transformed and indeed, humans are transformed. Tasks that 
previously were impossible or even inconceivable can become trivially simple. 
Accordingly, the aim of instructional design is to facilitate the acquisition of knowl-
edge in long-term memory via a working memory that is limited in capacity and 
duration until it is transformed by knowledge held in long-term memory. The char-
acteristics of that memory can provide guidelines relevant to designing instruction. 
The initial process of specifying instructional design principles begins in Part III of 
this book.
The cognitive load imposed on working memory by various instructional proce-
dures originates from either the intrinsic nature of the instructional material, result-
ing in an intrinsic cognitive load, or from the manner in which the material is 
presented and the activities required of learners, resulting in an extraneous cogni-
tive load. Chapter 5 in Part III introduces the instructional applications of cognitive 
load theory by outlining the categories of cognitive load, their interactions and their 
instructional consequences. Chapter 6 discusses techniques that have been used to 
measure cognitive load.
The chapters of Part IV discuss the range of instructional effects generated by the 
theory. Over 25 years, researchers from around the globe have used cognitive load 
theory to generate a variety of instructional procedures. Those procedures character-
istically are tested for effectiveness by comparing them to more traditional methods 
using randomised, controlled experiments. When the results of such comparisons 
indicate the superiority of a new procedure over a commonly used procedure, a 
cognitive load effect is demonstrated. Cognitive load effects provide us with novel 
instructional guidelines that constitute the ultimate aim of cognitive load theory. 
These guidelines constitute the major justification for devising cognitive load theory 
and are discussed in Chapters 7–17. Each chapter describes one or more of the 
cognitive load effects generated by the theory with each effect indicating an instruc-
tional procedure, tested for effectiveness, and recommended for use. The conclusions 
of Chapter 18 tie together the various strands of the preceding sections.
Over the two to three decades that cognitive load theory has been used as an 
instructional theory, it has undergone considerable development and change. In an 
example of a feedback loop, the changes to cognitive load theory have been driven 
largely by the instructional effects generated by the theory. Most commonly, 

viii
Preface
the theory has generated a new instructional procedure at a point in time and that 
procedure has been demonstrated in a particular curriculum area using a specific set 
of materials. On occasions, the effect has failed to generalise to a different area and 
different conditions. Such failures require an explanation and that explanation usu-
ally results in both theory development and new instructional effects and proce-
dures. In this manner, the edifice that constitutes cognitive load theory has been 
constructed.
Ultimately, the theory stands or falls according to its ability to generate novel, 
useful, instructional procedures, a justification common to all instructional theories. 
We hope cognitive load theory passes this test. The most recent version of the 
theory, along with the instructional procedures generated by the theory over many 
years is presented in this book. We begin, in the next chapter, by using evolutionary 
theory to categorise knowledge.

Acknowledgements
There are far too many people who have contributed to cognitive load theory over the 
years to be able to thank in anything other than general terms. The first group to thank 
is the army of research students who ultimately did most of the work associated with 
the theory. Many of those students from around the world have since become highly 
respected international scholars in their own right. Without them, this book would not 
have been written. We owe them a debt of gratitude that can never be repaid. One of 
those ex-students, Elizabeth Owen, carefully read the manuscript and eliminated 
many of our more clumsy efforts. We thank her for her work, emphasising that any 
remaining confusions are entirely our responsibility. Another research student, Chee 
Lee, funded by the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences at UNSW, did a magnificent 
job of organising our reference list and assisting with the figures. Her patience knows 
no bounds!
The empirical work described in this book and largely carried out by research 
students required the testing of countless students (using those randomised, con-
trolled experiments!) in many of the population centres around the world. They 
deserve a special thank you. We hope that as small compensation, our procedures 
have assisted them in their studies.
Our many collaborators from around the world have contributed far more to 
cognitive load theory than we could ever achieve. The theory is theirs, not ours.
Lastly, and most importantly, we would like to thank Susan, Robyn and Marika. 
They have put up with us and for them, cognitive load theory has been a near lifetime 
sentence!

The first step that we need to make in considering the manner in which human 
cognition is organised is to categorise knowledge. Different categories of knowl-
edge may be acquired, organised and stored in different ways and require different 
instructional procedures. Understanding how we deal with different categories of 
knowledge is a requirement in determining which aspects of human cognition are 
important from an instructional design perspective.
There are a very large number of ways of categorising knowledge but fortu-
nately, most knowledge category distinctions that can be made are irrelevant from 
an instructional point of view because they have no demonstrated differences in 
their instructional implications. One category that is relevant concerns the distinc-
tion between knowledge we have specifically evolved to acquire, known as biologi-
cally primary knowledge, and knowledge that has more recently become important 
for cultural reasons, known as biologically secondary knowledge. In Chapter 1, we 
discuss the distinction between biologically primary and secondary knowledge and 
the instructional implications that flow from that distinction.
We deal quite differently with biologically primary and biologically secondary 
information. Recognising faces, recognising speech, using general problem-solving 
strategies, and engaging in basic social relations provide examples of biologically 
primary knowledge that we have evolved to acquire. Such knowledge is modular. 
We evolved to deal with the various types of primary knowledge at different times 
and in different ways. For example, we might expect that the cognitive processes 
required to allow us to learn to recognise faces is likely to be very different from 
the processes that allow us to recognise spoken words. While we have an ability to 
easily learn to recognise a large range of human faces or to recognise the immense 
number of sounds required by our native language without tuition, the manner in 
which we acquire those skills is likely to be quite different with divergent cognitive 
processes. Furthermore, not only do the skills required to recognise faces and 
sounds differ from each other due to their modularity, such biologically evolved 
primary abilities require a different form of cognition from the general information 
processing required to acquire biologically secondary knowledge.
Biologically secondary knowledge is knowledge more recently required by soci-
eties for cultural reasons. Examples are reading, writing or any of the many other

topics for which instruction is provided. Instructional design is largely concerned 
with biologically secondary, not primary knowledge. When dealing with secondary 
knowledge, human cognition provides an example of a general, information pro-
cessing engine. It is general because, in contrast to the structures that process pri-
mary information, the secondary processing engine is capable of processing a wide 
range of information categories. Furthermore, since instructional design is con-
cerned largely with secondary, not primary knowledge, a description of the cogni-
tive machinery driving the acquisition of secondary knowledge can lead directly to 
instructional design procedures.
Why Instructional Design Needs to Distinguish Between 
Biologically Primary and Secondary Knowledge
Human structures and functions are the product of evolution by natural selection. 
Everything, from structures such as our opposable thumb to functions such as oxy-
gen/carbon dioxide transfers in our lungs, exists due to a long history of evolution 
over countless generations. While the evolution of our physical structures and func-
tions tend to dominate our awareness when we consider our evolutionary history, 
the evolution of the human mind tends to take a back seat. We less frequently think 
of the human mind as an entity that evolved and even more rarely consider the 
consequences of an evolutionary view of human cognition. There are some impor-
tant educational consequences that flow from considering brain structures and their 
resultant cognitive functions as the product of evolution by natural selection. 
Considering human cognition from an evolutionary perspective can yield novel 
insights into the functioning of the human mind and those insights may, in turn, 
yield instructional insights (Sweller, 2003, 2004; Sweller & Sweller, 2006). In this 
chapter we will consider the two categories of knowledge introduced above that we 
have evolved to acquire, biologically primary and biologically secondary knowl-
edge. How we acquire those two categories of knowledge and the consequent 
instructional implications will be analysed.
The distinction between biologically primary and biologically secondary knowl-
edge was suggested by Geary (2007, 2008). By distinguishing between these cate-
gories of knowledge, Geary has provided a unique base for educational psychology. 
He differentiates between biologically secondary knowledge that is learnable and 
teachable and biologically primary knowledge that is learnable but not teachable 
because it is usually learned without being explicitly taught. In the process, he 
explains many otherwise puzzling findings. Indeed, his formulation has the poten-
tial to not only change instructional design but to change our view of ourselves.
The contrast between primary and secondary knowledge constitutes the core of 
Geary’s treatment. We have evolved to assimilate biologically primary knowledge. In 
some ways, it can be seen as instinctive knowledge that we are programmed to acquire 
and so does not need to be taught. On the other hand, we also can assimilate biologi-
cally secondary knowledge; but because it is knowledge we have not had to deal with 

5
Biologically Primary Knowledge
during our evolutionary history, it is different and acquired in a fundamentally different 
manner to biologically primary knowledge. Biologically secondary, unlike primary 
knowledge, needs to be explicitly taught within a culture. The secondary knowledge 
we acquire is largely dependent on the culture in which we develop. Since it is culture 
specific, it will alter from culture to culture. While secondary knowledge develops 
from primary knowledge, the characteristics of the cognitive processes associated with 
the two systems are in many respects quite different and those differences have instruc-
tional ramifications. We will begin by considering biologically primary knowledge.
Biologically Primary Knowledge
Humans have a wide repertoire of skills based on biologically primary knowledge. 
We sometimes take those skills for granted because they are universal, acquired 
effortlessly and frequently unconsciously, without explicit instruction. For example, 
we readily recognise and distinguish between human faces and recognise physical 
objects, learn how to interact with other humans, and learn to physically interact 
with our environment through movement, without explicit instructional pro-
grammes. Learning to listen and speak a first language is one of our most important 
biologically primary skills. We do not require curricula or learning and teaching 
programmes indicating how we should be taught our first language. The very con-
cept of a curriculum devised to teach a first language to normally developing chil-
dren is likely to be seen as peculiar. And yet, immeasurable amounts of information 
must be processed and stored in order for us to be able to listen and speak. For 
example, when learning to speak, we must simultaneously learn to manipulate and 
coordinate our lips, tongue, breath and voice in a large number of variations. We 
learn but are not taught this skill. There is no curriculum that anyone has devised 
to teach us how to talk and, indeed, most of us would have no conception of how to 
teach someone to speak their first language. We do not need to have such a curricu-
lum because we have evolved to learn how to speak without being taught. Despite 
the immense amounts of information required in learning how to speak a first 
­language, we experience no discernible cognitive load in acquiring the necessary 
skills in this or any other biologically primary area.
Why are the skills associated with these tasks so easily acquired despite their huge 
information content? We readily learn these skills because we have evolved to learn 
them over countless generations as a necessary condition of our biological survival. 
They constitute our biological rather than cultural inheritance and we expect most 
people to learn these skills irrespective of the culture in which they have developed. 
Geary (2007, 2008) categorised such instinctively acquired skills as biologically or 
evolutionary primary skills that require biologically primary knowledge.
Biologically primary knowledge is modular with every primary skill largely inde-
pendent of every other skill. Each primary skill is likely to have evolved quite sepa-
rately to every other primary skill, probably during a different evolutionary epoch. The 
manner in which we learn to recognise faces or the manner in which we learn a first 

6

language may bear little relation to each other. They are related only in that during two, 
quite different evolutionary epochs, we have evolved to acquire the knowledge 
required to learn to recognise faces and to speak. Because of this evolutionary history, 
both skills are acquired easily and effortlessly, without explicitly being taught.
We tend not to know we are acquiring primary knowledge and most primary 
knowledge is acquired when we are very young. We do not need to instruct people 
in the acquisition of primary knowledge. Membership of a functioning society is all 
that is required. Indeed, our ability to set up primitive societies is itself an example 
of biologically primary knowledge.
There are no definitive tests that identify biologically primary knowledge. The 
manner in which information is acquired provides the only available procedure that 
points to the presence of biologically primary knowledge. If we can acquire infor-
mation easily and rapidly in an area without having to first consciously, actively 
learn and without explicit teaching, then that area almost certainly constitutes bio-
logically primary knowledge.
Biologically primary knowledge provides a base for most aspects of human 
cognition. Because we have evolved to easily, rapidly and automatically store huge 
amounts of some categories of information in long-term memory, we are provided 
with a basic source for human ingenuity, creativity and skill. But biologically pri-
mary knowledge in itself, while essential, does not lead directly to those aspects of 
human cognition that we interpret as constituting intelligent behaviour. For exam-
ple, while speaking is an example of biologically primary knowledge and we learn 
to speak easily and automatically by immersion in a culture, we also can con-
sciously learn to speak in a new and different manner and can be explicitly taught 
to speak differently from the manner in which we grew up to speak. We may, for 
example, learn that certain grammatical constructions are either appropriate or 
inappropriate in our culture. We may be taught that it is appropriate to say ‘It isn’t 
here’ but inappropriate to say ‘It ain’t here’. We also may be taught certain complex 
language skills associated with particular academic disciplines. Skills that require 
a substantial alteration in the expression of biologically primary knowledge are no 
longer biologically primary. They belong to biologically secondary knowledge.
Biologically Secondary Knowledge
Human culture is constantly changing, no more so than in recent times, with our 
stock of knowledge increasing exponentially. The nature of that new knowledge is 
quite distinct from the biologically primary knowledge discussed in the previous 
section. We have evolved to learn the motor and cognitive processes required to 
speak, for example, and will do so without explicit tuition. In contrast, while we 
require many aspects of biologically primary knowledge in order to learn to write, 
learning to write is a vastly different skill to learning to speak. We have not evolved 
to learn to write. We have only been able to write for a few thousand years, far too 
short a time to be influenced by biological evolution. Indeed, for most of the period 
after humans learned to write, only a tiny minority of people could write. It has only 

7
Biologically Secondary Knowledge
been with the advent of mass education in the last 100 years or so, and only in some 
societies, that most people have learned to write. The manner in which we have 
evolved to learn to speak has not and could not be recapitulated in learning to write. 
Accordingly, the instructional processes required to learn to write are vastly differ-
ent from those required to learn to speak. The instructional processes differ because 
the cognitive system used to learn to speak is different from the system used to 
learn to write. Writing provides an example of biologically secondary knowledge 
rather than the biologically primary knowledge required to speak.
As well as the many different types of biologically primary knowledge we have 
evolved to acquire, each with its own acquisition system, we also have a system, 
probably unitary, for acquiring biologically secondary knowledge (Geary, 2007, 
2008) required for cultural reasons but which we have not specifically evolved to 
acquire. In contrast to the ease with which we acquire biological primary knowl-
edge, the acquisition of biologically secondary knowledge is effortful and con-
scious. While we will learn to speak just by immersion in a speaking society, we 
are unlikely to learn to write just by immersion in a writing society. Learning to 
write requires more than immersion. Being surrounded by people who speak pro-
vides a guarantee that most persons will learn to speak. Being surrounded by people 
who write provides no guarantee that a person will learn to write. Learning to write 
requires conscious effort and because acquiring secondary knowledge can be dif-
ficult, and because the importance of acquiring such knowledge is critical to mod-
ern societies, we have set up massive educational structures with the sole purpose 
of assisting learners to acquire secondary knowledge. Educational institutions exist 
in order to perpetuate and advance culture. While the acquisition of culture is 
dependent on biologically primary knowledge, culture itself does not consist of 
such knowledge. Rather, it consists of biologically secondary knowledge. We have 
not evolved to acquire most aspects of our culture automatically and unconsciously, 
especially advanced culture, in the way we acquire biologically primary knowl-
edge. We require formal and informal institutions to acquire the biologically sec-
ondary knowledge that constitutes culture.
While we have not evolved to acquire any particular biologically secondary skill 
in the manner in which we have evolved to acquire particular primary skills, we 
have evolved the cognitive system that permits the acquisition of a possibly infinite 
range of secondary skills. That cognitive system will be discussed in detail in 
Chapters 2–4 of Part II.
Whether a skill requires some form of institutional support for its acquisition can 
be used as an informal guide to whether the skill relies largely on biologically 
­primary or biologically secondary knowledge . Primary knowledge acquisition does not 
require institutional support while secondary knowledge acquisition does require 
such support. Every subject, every curriculum area from cooking to physics ­consists 
heavily of biologically secondary knowledge. How we acquire biologically 
­secondary knowledge provides the major theme of this book.
Since the processes by which secondary knowledge is acquired are quite different 
to those required to obtain primary knowledge, we might expect the instructional 
processes also to differ. The fact that we do not acquire secondary knowledge auto-
matically or unconsciously has instructional consequences. In Geary’s (2007) words 

8
1 Categories of Knowledge: An Evolutionary Approach
(Geary’s italics), ‘most children will not be sufficiently motivated nor cognitively able 
to learn all of secondary knowledge needed for functioning in modern societies with-
out well organized, explicit and direct teacher instruction.’ (p. 43). Simply leaving 
students to learn by constructing their own knowledge while immersed in an appro-
priate environment may be desirable or even unavoidable when dealing with the pri-
mary knowledge that we have evolved to acquire. Such procedures are not desirable 
when dealing with secondary knowledge that is culturally invented by humans. We 
have not evolved to specifically acquire such knowledge and so we require quite dif-
ferent and in some senses, ‘artificial’ techniques for assisting learners. As will be 
discussed in the next section, those techniques require highly explicit guidance.
Instructional Consequences
The division of biologically primary and secondary knowledge has instructional 
implications for both categories. With respect to primary knowledge, many of the 
general cognitive skills that are sometimes the subject of instructional procedures 
are skills that are basic and essential to human life. We are very likely to have 
evolved to acquire general cognitive skills as opposed to the more domain-specific 
skill which is associated with the subjects taught in educational institutions. As 
indicated above, if we have evolved to acquire general cognitive skills, they are 
biologically primary and are learnable but not teachable because they are automati-
cally acquired. Attempting to teach biologically primary knowledge may be futile.
There are even more important instructional implications associated with bio-
logically secondary knowledge. While general cognitive strategies constitute 
­biologically primary knowledge, domain-specific knowledge taught in educational 
institutions constitutes biologically secondary knowledge. Secondary knowledge 
needs to be explicitly taught and is usually consciously learned, unlike primary 
knowledge. Expecting learners to acquire secondary knowledge via immersion may 
be just as futile as expecting biologically primary knowledge to be teachable 
(Sweller, 2008). The specific instructional consequences that flow from the charac-
teristics of biologically secondary knowledge will be discussed in detail in Part  IV. 
In this part, we will discuss more general instructional consequences associated 
with both primary and secondary knowledge, beginning with primary knowledge.
Instructional Consequences Associated with Biologically  
Primary Knowledge
There are a large range of general cognitive skills that are likely to be biologically 
primary, evolved activities. Our ability to engage in general problem solving, plan-
ning, decision making and thinking provide obvious candidates. We learn these 
skills but there is little evidence that they can be taught. Means–ends analysis is the 

9
Instructional Consequences
most important, best-known, general problem-solving strategy discussed in the 
­literature (e.g., Newell & Simon, 1972; Sweller, 1988). Several steps are required 
to use this general strategy irrespective of the problem domain. We must simultane-
ously consider the current problem state and the goal state, search for differences 
between these two states, search for legitimate problem-solving operators that can 
be used to reduce any differences found between the current and the goal state, and 
choose a problem-solving operator to apply to the current problem state. Once a 
problem-solving operator has been applied to a problem state, a new state is cre-
ated. We now must check to see if the new state corresponds to the goal state. If it 
does, the problem is solved. If it does not, the procedure is used recursively until 
the goal is attained. This means–ends strategy will be described using an elemen-
tary algebra transformation problem.
Assume we are using a means–ends strategy to solve the algebraic problem, 
a + b = c, solve for a. We begin with the current problem state which also is the 
initial state, (a + b = c). That state needs to be transformed in one or more moves 
into the goal state where the goal state consists of a isolated on the left-hand side 
of the equation. To accomplish this aim, we must search for any differences 
between the current problem state and the goal state. In this problem, there is only 
one difference. The equation has ‘+b’ located on the left side. To solve the ­problem, 
we must eliminate ‘+b’ from the left side. The next step required by a means–ends 
strategy is to search for legitimate problem-solving operators to eliminate ‘+b’ 
from the left side of the equation. That step will satisfy the requirement to reduce 
the differences between the current problem state and the goal state. In the case of 
algebra, the rules of algebra provide the problem-solving operators. Subtracting the 
addend (+b) from both sides of the equation will eliminate +b from the left side. 
Once this move has been made, we must check if the goal has been attained. In this 
case, the goal has been attained and so the problem is solved.
We use a general problem-solving strategy such as means–ends analysis when-
ever we must solve a problem for which we do not have domain-specific knowledge 
of a solution. For example, junior high school students beginning to learn algebra 
are likely to use the strategy as described above. Most readers of this book will not 
use a means–ends strategy to solve this algebra problem. After some exposure to 
algebra, a domain-specific strategy will be used. With sufficient experience of alge-
bra, a person will instantly recognise the problem as one that requires subtraction 
of the addend from both sides. A search for differences between the given and goal 
states or a search for problem-solving operators that will reduce any differences 
found will not be necessary. Problem solvers will have learned to recognise the 
relevant problem states and know which solution move is appropriate for each state 
without searching for moves. They will immediately subtract b from both sides of 
the equation without engaging in a search for an appropriate move. Recognising 
problem states and their appropriate moves only occurs after considerable learning 
and only applies to particular, domain-specific problems. In contrast, a means–ends 
strategy is general because it can be applied to a large range of novel, unrelated 
problems that we might encounter. We only use the strategy when we are novices 
and do not have domain-specific knowledge that we can use to generate moves.

10
1 Categories of Knowledge: An Evolutionary Approach
Evidence that novices use means–ends analysis while experts use ­domain-­specific 
knowledge when solving problems comes from the substantial literature on expert–
novice differences. For example, Larkin, McDermott, Simon, and Simon (1980a, b) 
found that novices, when solving physics problems, work backwards from the goal 
using a means–ends strategy while experts work forward from the givens using 
previously acquired knowledge. Sweller, Mawer, and Ward (1983) demonstrated 
the switch from a backward working, means–ends strategy to a forward working 
knowledge-based strategy. These results indicate that if we are aware of knowledge 
indicating a problem solution, we will routinely use that knowledge. In the absence 
of knowledge of appropriate problem-solving moves, we will use a means–ends 
strategy.
As far as we are aware, there are no successful examples in the problem-solving 
literature demonstrating improved problem-solving performance following the 
teaching of a means–ends strategy. We suggest it is unteachable because all normal 
humans have evolved to use the strategy. For survival, our ancestors needed to know 
how to use means–ends analysis. Without a means–ends strategy, we could not 
search for food, cross a river or find a route from point A to point B. We all use the 
strategy without explicit instruction because it is part of our repertoire of biologi-
cally primary knowledge.
All examples of general problem-solving strategies are likely to be equally 
unteachable for the same reason that means–ends analysis is unteachable. General 
cognitive strategies are very likely to uniformly consist of examples of biologically 
primary knowledge. The ease and automaticity with which we learn to use general 
problem-solving strategies without instruction provide evidence that they are 
acquired as primary knowledge. There are many examples of recommended general 
problem-solving strategies (see Polya, 1957); however, they cannot be taught to 
improve problem-solving performance because they consist of biologically primary 
knowledge which is acquired naturally. An example is provided by recommenda-
tions suggesting that when faced with a difficult problem for which we are unable to 
find a solution, we should think of a similar problem for which we know the solution 
moves (Polya, 1957). Teaching problem solvers to consider a similar problem is no 
more likely to be effective than teaching them to use a means–ends strategy. If we 
can think of them, we automatically generalise knowledge from previous, similar 
problems. Whenever we solve a familiar problem, we automatically treat it as 
though we know the problem and its solution even though it always differs in some 
respects from previous problems. If we know of a similar problem that can assist us 
in solving the current problem we will always use that similar problem because the 
knowledge that similar problems with similar solutions are useful is an example of 
biologically primary knowledge. If we cannot think of a similar problem, exhorta-
tions to think of a similar problem are pointless. Attempting to teach people to think 
of similar problems when solving unfamiliar problems is likely to remain just as 
unteachable in the future as it has in the past. We know of no randomised, controlled 
experiments indicating the effectiveness of such a strategy. Without such biologi-
cally primary, general problem-solving techniques we could not have survived and 
so we have evolved to assimilate them rapidly and easily without tuition.

11
Instructional Consequences
A similar argument applies to all general cognitive techniques such as planning, 
decision making and thinking. We have evolved to engage in all of these techniques 
as part of our survival mechanism. Until clear bodies of evidence become available 
indicating that very general cognitive techniques are teachable as well as learnable, 
we should assume that general cognitive techniques consist of biologically primary 
knowledge that we acquire automatically. Some cognitive techniques are learned 
automatically and so cannot be taught.
What would constitute evidence for learnable/teachable general problem-solving 
strategies? Such evidence requires far transfer data from randomised, controlled 
experiments that alter one variable at a time. Test materials must be unrelated to 
learning materials to ensure that a general problem-solving strategy has been 
acquired rather than domain-specific knowledge. Anecdotal data does not consti-
tute evidence. Nor does data from before/after tests without a control group, or a 
controlled experiment in which multiple variables are altered simultaneously. All 
of these techniques are compromised because any results obtained can be due to a 
variety of irrelevant factors. Far transfer tests are essential because if a general, 
cognitive strategy has been acquired, it should be usable and beneficial under novel 
conditions and transfer tests can be used to ensure that any effect found is not due 
to enhanced, domain-specific learning. To this point, there has been no sign of such 
a body of evidence in favour of teachable, general cognitive strategies becoming 
available. (A possible exception is considered in Chapter 3 in a discussion of 
brainstorming.)
Instructional Consequences of Biologically Secondary Knowledge
Biologically secondary knowledge is teachable but the manner in which we teach has 
been bedevilled by our failure to distinguish between primary and secondary knowl-
edge. We have assumed that since the bulk of what humans learn outside of educa-
tional institutions is acquired effortlessly without direct, explicit instruction, the best 
way to improve instructional procedures is to eliminate explicit instruction. 
Constructivist, discovery and problem-based learning advocates have assumed that 
withholding information from learners should be beneficial because explicit informa-
tion is not required for people to acquire much of the information we need to function 
in our societies (Kirschner, Sweller, & Clark, 2006; Mayer, 2004). Rather than show-
ing learners how to best solve a problem, it is assumed that they learn more, or at least 
learn better, if they discover how to solve the problem by themselves, with minimal 
levels of guidance from instructors. This view assumes that learners need to learn how 
to construct knowledge for themselves and so explicit instructional guidance should 
be avoided in favour of having learners discover knowledge.
From a historical perspective, discovery learning should be seen as the precursor 
of a long line of indirect, inquiry-based teaching procedures that culminated in con-
structivist teaching. While the procedures have differing titles depending on the era 
of their popularity (discovery learning, problem-based learning, inquiry ­learning, 

12
1 Categories of Knowledge: An Evolutionary Approach
constructivist learning amongst others) it is not possible to distinguish between them 
and they should be considered as essentially identical. All assume that information 
should be withheld from learners during instruction (Sweller, 2009a).
The reasons why constructivist teaching is assumed by many to be superior are 
not entirely clear because the reasons tend neither to be based on any obvious cog-
nitive architecture nor on a body of data. Nevertheless, it seems possible to discern 
two categories of explanation. The first category assumes that withholding informa-
tion from learners will, paradoxically, result in their acquiring that information better. 
The act of discovering information improves the quality of information according 
to this view. Discovered knowledge should be qualitatively better than directly 
taught knowledge (Bruner, 1961).
If this view was correct, then knowledge acquired during problem solving 
should be superior to knowledge acquired while studying worked examples. 
Evidence for this proposition is entirely absent. In fact, rather than providing sup-
port, the evidence is contrary to a discovery learning/constructivist position. Klahr 
and Nigam (2004) found no difference between the quality of knowledge of science 
learners who discovered a science principle as opposed to those who were explicitly 
instructed in the principle. The only difference was that those who were required to 
use a discovery approach took longer with fewer students learning the principle. 
Furthermore, evidence based on the worked example effect (Sweller & Cooper, 
1985) is quite the reverse of what we should expect based on a constructivist, dis-
covery learning viewpoint. The worked example effect occurs when learners learn 
more and are better at solving subsequent problems after studying worked examples 
rather than solving problems. That evidence will be discussed in detail in Chapter 8. 
Only when expertise develops does solving problems become a viable instructional 
technique, as discussed in Chapter 12.
The second argument why discovery learning/constructivist teaching procedures 
might be effective is less concerned with the acquisition of curricula information 
directly, but instead is concerned with learning to discover information in general. 
This view assumes that withholding information improves learners’ ability to sub-
sequently discover information. In other words, discovering information is assumed 
to be a general skill that needs to be taught as a useful technique for the acquisition 
of curriculum knowledge. Unless we are taught how to discover knowledge, we will 
not be able to find most of the knowledge we need.
It will, of course, be apparent from our previous discussion on the instructional 
consequences of primary knowledge that there is every reason to suppose that teach-
ing people how to construct knowledge or giving them practice in constructing 
knowledge is likely to be futile. For survival, we have evolved to construct knowledge 
and so knowledge construction is a primary skill with all the characteristics of a pri-
mary skill. We learn the skill easily, automatically and without tuition. Of course, if 
learning to discover knowledge is defined as learning to use a library or the Internet, 
those skills do need to be taught but they should be taught directly and explicitly 
because they consist of biologically secondary knowledge. We have not specifically 
evolved to learn to use a library or the Internet. We have evolved to construct knowl-
edge and so there is no point attempting to teach knowledge construction.

13
Conclusions
In summary, teaching students by having them discover the laws, rules, concepts 
and procedures of a discipline with minimal guidance by withholding easily pre-
sented information so that they can learn to construct knowledge is pointless if 
learners automatically construct knowledge. While the concepts and procedures of 
a discipline constitute secondary knowledge that needs to be taught, our ability to 
construct secondary knowledge is based on primary knowledge and so we do not 
need to be taught how to construct secondary knowledge. We merely need to be 
taught the relevant concepts and procedures, not how to acquire them. Furthermore, 
there is no evidence for the assumption that knowledge acquired by discovery is 
superior to knowledge acquired by explicit instruction. We automatically construct 
knowledge because it is an essential, evolved, primary skill that can no more be 
explicitly taught than recognising faces or listening to a first language. If so, empiri-
cal evidence for the effectiveness of constructivist teaching compared to direct 
instruction may never become available because primary skills are learned, not 
taught.
Conclusions
David Geary’s formulation is interesting from a purely scientific perspective. It is 
critical from an instructional design perspective. If his views are valid, many of the 
currently, commonly used instructional procedures are utterly misguided and 
urgently need reform.
In this chapter, highly influenced by the work of Geary, we have suggested that 
knowledge can be divided into biologically primary knowledge that we have 
evolved to acquire and biologically secondary knowledge that has become impor-
tant for cultural reasons. Primary knowledge is learned easily, automatically and 
unconsciously and cannot be taught. Secondary knowledge is culturally acquired 
knowledge that has become important in a particular culture. It is learned con-
sciously and with effort and should be explicitly taught. Secondary knowledge is 
the domain of most of the curricula that can be found in educational institutions. 
Those institutions were devised specifically to teach biologically secondary 
­knowledge because we have difficulty acquiring such knowledge without explicit 
tuition. It is quite misguided to treat biologically secondary knowledge as though it 
is primary knowledge.
Cognitive load theory and the remainder of this book are concerned in the most 
part with biologically secondary knowledge. Part II deals with those aspects of 
human cognitive architecture associated with processing biologically secondary 
information. This chapter used evolutionary theory to suggest that categories of 
knowledge differ depending on the extent to which we have evolved to acquire 
them. In discussing human cognitive architecture associated with biologically sec-
ondary information, a deeper use of evolutionary theory is required. The very 
machinery of evolutionary theory may be closely associated with the machinery of 
human cognitive architecture. It will be suggested in Part II that the information 

14
1 Categories of Knowledge: An Evolutionary Approach
processing characteristics of human cognitive architecture recapitulate the ­information 
processing characteristics of evolution by natural selection. As a ­consequence,  
we can use the processes of evolution to throw light on how we learn, think and 
solve problems. And, of course, how we learn, think and solve problems is essential 
to instructional design.

Human cognitive architecture refers to the manner in which the components that 
constitute human cognition such as working and long-term memory are organised. 
The characteristics of human cognitive architecture when dealing with biologically 
secondary knowledge are considered in Chapters 2–4. While Chapter 1 in Part I 
indicated how biological evolution can be used to distinguish between important 
categories of knowledge, Chapters 2–4 of Part II use an evolutionary perspective in 
a quite different manner. In Chapters 2–4 the well-known machinery of biological 
evolution is used to throw light on what we suggest is the similar, analogous machin-
ery of human cognition when dealing with biologically secondary information. 
Biological evolution requires a store of genetic information that determines the func-
tions and activities of an organism in a particular environment. Those functions and 
activities are passed on to succeeding generations but can be altered by random 
mutations of the genetic material. If those mutations are adaptive for the species in 
the same or a new environment they are retained resulting in a change in the genetic 
information stored. If they are not adaptive, they are jettisoned. In this way, informa-
tion is stored, transmitted and changed during evolution by natural selection.
This information processing system is not unique to biological evolution. The 
same processes are used to deal with secondary information by the human cognitive 
system. They belong to a category of systems that occurs in nature and so we will 
refer to them as natural information processing systems. These systems govern the 
activities of natural entities. Evolution by natural selection and human cognition are 
analogous because both provide examples of a natural information processing 
system.
Nature includes many information processing systems. Every living organism 
depends for its survival on an information processing system that allows it to deal 
with the various categories of information that the organism must deal with in its 
natural environment. These information processing systems vary in complexity and 
sophistication from relatively simple to immensely complex. We are concerned 
with the most sophisticated of those systems, biological evolution and human cog-
nition. They have several definitional characteristics. First, sophisticated natural 
information processing systems are able to create novel information intended to 
deal with a variety of environments. Second, having created novel information and 
determined that it is effective, sophisticated natural information processing systems 
Part II
Human Cognitive Architecture

Part II Human Cognitive Architecture
can remember that information for subsequent use or eliminate it if it is not effective. 
Third, these systems can use stored information to govern their activities. Fourth, 
they can disseminate effective information across space and time.
A sophisticated natural information processing system must meet these defining 
characteristics and, of course, it can be seen that the characteristics apply to human 
cognition. We do create novel information, have procedures for remembering that 
information, can use information to govern our activities and are able to dissemi-
nate information. While the characteristics apply to human cognition, it is not 
coincidental that they apply equally to evolution by natural selection. Evolution 
also creates, remembers, uses and disseminates information. Since both human 
cognition and biological evolution are sophisticated natural information processing 
systems that create, disseminate, use and remember information, it is plausible to 
conjecture that they both rely on the same basic information processing machinery 
to function. The operation of that machinery is based on a set of principles.
The components of natural information processing systems can be described in 
many ways but in this book five basic principles will be used: the information store 
principle; the borrowing and reorganising principle; the randomness as genesis 
principle; the narrow limits of change principle; and the environmental organising 
and linking principle. These principles will be shown to underlie both biological 
evolution and human cognition and so human cognition can be treated as an ana-
logue of biological evolution. An application of these principles to human cognition 
provides us, in effect, with a cognitive architecture whose principles have already 
been established in evolutionary biological science as an integrated, natural infor-
mation processing system. If the same principles can be applied to both human 
cognition and biological evolution, we potentially have a cognitive system that we 
know functions because evolution by natural selection is an established, function-
ing theory. In this manner, the established mechanisms of biological evolution can 
be used to throw light on the far less well-established mechanisms of human cogni-
tion. The five natural information processing system principles described in 
Chapters 2–4 will be shown to apply equally to biological evolution and human 
cognition. We will begin with the information store principle.

Natural environments tend to be both highly complex and highly variable. The 
frequently immeasurable number of variables associated with natural environments 
tends to be in constant flux. Most animals and plants must survive in complex, vari-
able environments dealing with day and night, summer and winter, drought and 
flood. Any natural information processing system must find a way to handle this 
complexity and variability. Nevertheless, despite the complex, variable environ-
ment in which a natural information processing system must function, it must be 
able to treat its environment as familiar and predictable. It must be able to ignore 
variability that does not matter to its functioning while responding to variability 
that does matter. In one sense, the manner in which this complexity is handled is 
straightforward. Immense complexity is handled by immense information stores. 
Natural information processing systems build sufficiently large information stores to 
handle most of the vagaries inherent in their environments.
How Natural Information Processing Systems Store Information
Evolutionary Biology
The manner in which the need for a large information store is met by evolutionary 
biology is well known. All genomes include a huge amount of DNA-based infor-
mation that determines most biological activity (Portin, 2002; Stotz & Griffiths, 
2004). The size of any genome must be large because organisms survive in 
­complex, information-rich environments. A simple, small information store is 
unlikely to be able to deal with the complexity of any natural environment. A large 
and sophisticated store is needed to deal with the inevitable environmental varia-
tions it will face.
There is no agreed measure of genomic complexity or size. Nevertheless, all 
genomes consists of, at a minimum, thousands, or in many organisms, billions of 
base pairs that can be considered units of information. (There is no consensus on 
Chapter 2
Amassing Information: The Information Store 
Principle

18
2 Amassing Information: The Information Store Principle
what should be used as a measure of complexity but all measures yield very large 
numbers of units of information.) The genetic functioning of organisms and species 
rely on that large store of information. If all natural information processing systems 
require a large store of information, it follows that human cognition also must rely 
on an equivalently large store of information.
Human Cognition: Long-Term Memory
The role of long-term memory in cognition provides an analogical equivalent to a 
genome in evolutionary biology. Like a genome in biology, long-term memory acts 
as a very large store of information. The bulk of our normal, everyday activities are 
familiar. When we say something is ‘familiar’ what we really mean is that it is 
based on information in long-term memory. That information permits us to engage 
in activities from automatically recognising the huge number of objects we see 
from minute to minute to planning our routine daily activities. All depend on a 
huge, organised knowledge base held in long-term memory.
Storing biologically primary and biologically secondary information.  It can be 
argued that much of the information stored in long-term memory consists of bio-
logically primary knowledge. We have evolved to acquire enormous amounts of 
primary knowledge in order to survive and function in our world. For example, 
when we listen and speak, much of both the physical and social aspects of our 
activities are based on a massive store of primary knowledge held in long-term 
memory. Similarly, our ability to effortlessly navigate our physical world provides 
an indicator of knowledge stored in long-term memory. We see and recognise a 
large number of objects and faces and can engage in a wide range of physical activi-
ties. Many of these activities can be learned without lengthy training and so are 
indicative of primary knowledge held in long-term memory.
Our primary knowledge base enables us to engage in many of the activities that 
we frequently consider to be easy and simple. In fact, in information processing 
terms, many ‘simple’ activities are anything but simple. They appear simple solely 
because we have acquired them as biologically primary skills and all biologically 
primary skills are seen as simple and easy. The enormous amount of stored infor-
mation required to engage in most biologically primary activities can be seen from 
the difficulty we have in readily programming computers to mimic primary skills 
such as recognising voices. That difficulty arises from the large knowledge base 
required by these skills. We have evolved to rapidly acquire a large knowledge 
base but because of its size and complexity, an equivalent knowledge base can be very 
difficult to readily program into a computer.
As an example, consider a simple task such as going outside to pick a flower. 
Learning to go outside and pick a flower is not a task that requires a long period of 
training. Despite its simplicity, programming a computer to engage in a similar task 
would require an enormous expenditure of time and effort and indeed, as far as we 
are aware, such a task is beyond today’s robot-connected computers. In reality, it is 

19
How Natural Information Processing Systems Store Information
an immensely complex task that only appears simple to us because it is based on a 
huge, primary knowledge base held in long-term memory. We may contrast other 
tasks that computers are programmed to do. Compared to going outside and accom-
plishing a simple task such as picking a flower, it is much easier to program a 
computer to play chess at grandmaster level or to carry out complex mathematical 
operations. We see these tasks as immensely complex because they are based on 
secondary knowledge that we have not evolved to acquire.
The extent to which we are able to go outside and pick a flower or carry out 
mathematical operations are both determined by the amount of knowledge held in 
long-term memory. Nevertheless, the category of knowledge required by the two 
tasks is quite different. Picking a flower requires biologically primary knowledge 
that is quantitatively immense but easily acquired because we have evolved to 
acquire that knowledge. Complex mathematics requires secondary knowledge that 
we have not specifically evolved to acquire and so is much more difficult. The 
knowledge base is probably greater in the case of the flower-picking exercise even 
though we acquire a flower-picking knowledge base much more readily than math-
ematical skills. As indicated above, the evidence that going outside to pick a flower 
may require a larger knowledge base than even complex mathematical operations 
comes from the differential ease of programming a computer to accomplish both 
tasks. It is probable that the information associated with biologically primary 
activities may constitute the bulk of the knowledge we hold in long-term memory.
Evidence for the size and function of stored biologically secondary information. 
While most knowledge held in long-term memory probably can be categorised as 
primary, in absolute terms our secondary knowledge base is still immeasurably 
large. De Groot’s (1965) and Chase and Simon’s (1973) work on chess can be used 
to indicate to us the immense amount of secondary information held in the long-term 
memory store. Furthermore, that seminal work indicated for the first time that many 
higher-level cognitive activities that were assumed to rely minimally or not at all on 
long-term memory were largely driven by the contents of the long-term store.
The initial impetus for de Groot’s work was the fact that chess grandmasters 
almost always defeat weekend players. He was concerned with finding the factors 
that almost invariably result in this outcome. What knowledge does a grandmaster 
have, in what activities does a grandmaster engage, to enable such dominance? 
There is a range of plausible hypotheses that, if valid, could provide an answer to 
this question. Indeed, several possible answers associated with problem-solving 
skill seem to have been intuitively assumed by most people who either played chess 
or thought about the factors that lead to chess skill.
One easily accepted plausible hypothesis is that grandmasters engage in a 
greater level of problem-solving search for suitable moves than weekend players. 
They may be particularly skilled at using means–ends analysis, for example. 
When using a means–ends strategy, grandmasters may search to a greater ‘depth’ 
than weekend players. That means instead of only considering the consequences 
of a small number of moves ahead they may consider a much longer series of moves. 
Considering the consequences of a longer rather than shorter series of 
moves should result in being able to choose better moves. Alternatively, chess 

20
2 Amassing Information: The Information Store Principle
grandmasters may engage in a greater search ‘in breadth’. Whenever they had to 
make a move, they might consider a large range of alternative moves while a 
weekend player may only consider a small number of alternative moves. If a 
larger number of alternatives are considered we might expect a better move to be 
found than if only a smaller number of alternatives are considered.
In fact, de Groot found no evidence that grandmasters’ superiority derived from 
either a greater search in depth or a greater search in breadth than weekend players. 
He found only one difference between different levels of players and that difference 
seemed to be quite unrelated to problem-solving skill. Rather, it was concerned 
with memory. De Groot showed chess players board configurations taken from real 
games for about 5 s before removing the pieces and asking the players to attempt 
to replace them in the configuration that they had just seen. The results indicated 
that masters and grandmasters were able to reproduce the board configurations that 
they were shown with a high degree of accuracy. In contrast, less-able players were 
far less accurate in replacing the pieces (see also, De Groot & Gobet, 1996).
De Groot obtained this result for chess board configurations taken from real 
games. He did not attempt to investigate if the same result could be obtained for 
pieces placed on a board in a random configuration rather than a real game 
­configuration. Instead, Chase and Simon (1973) replicated de Groot’s result but in 
addition ran exactly the same experiment placing the pieces on the board in a 
­random configuration. The results were much different. For random configurations, 
there were no differences between more- and less-expert chess players. All players 
performed equally poorly on random configurations compared to grandmasters 
reproducing real game configurations. Only expert players faced with real game 
configurations performed well on this memory test. Less-expert players performed 
poorly on both real game and random configurations while expert players per-
formed poorly on random configurations only.
In principle, these results are able to provide a full explanation of chess expertise 
without recourse to any other factors. Skill at chess is not based on an ability to 
think through a series of unique and ingenious chess moves. Expertise derives from 
learning to recognise many thousands of the board configurations that are found in 
chess games as well as learning the moves that are the most likely to be successful 
for the various configurations. This skill is acquired slowly over many years of 
consistent, continuous practice. That practice needs to be carried out with the 
explicit intention of improving performance, called ‘deliberate practice’ (Ericsson, 
Krampe, & Tesch-Romer, 1993). A chess grandmaster typically requires 10 years 
of deliberate practice before acquiring a high level of expertise.
Until de Groot’s and Chase and Simon’s work, the cognitive changes that 
occurred due to practice were essentially unknown. We now know what is learned 
during practice. According to Simon and Gilmartin (1973), chess grandmasters 
have stored in long-term memory tens of thousands of board configurations along 
with the best moves associated with those configurations. The source of chess-
playing skill derives from that stored information rather than some mysterious 
thinking skill. Paradoxically, it is more likely that a less-skilled player must engage 
in complex thought because a less-skilled player does not have large numbers of 

21
How Natural Information Processing Systems Store Information
board configurations and their associated moves stored in long-term memory. In the 
absence of stored knowledge, moves must be generated by problem-solving search. 
With the development of expertise, the need for problem-solving search activities 
is reduced. Instead, the best move at each choice-point becomes apparent without 
having to engage in search because that best move can be retrieved from long-term 
memory. Novices need to use thinking skills. Experts use knowledge.
This account of chess skill can be used to explain the phenomenon of simulta-
neous chess. In demonstration games, a chess grandmaster can simultaneously 
play and defeat a dozen weekend players. In the absence of a long-term memory 
explanation for chess skill, we would need to ask how anyone could possibly 
simultaneously devise multiple strategies for playing a dozen, complex, different 
games. The answer, of course, is that it is not possible, but nor is it required. Only 
the grandmaster’s opponents must attempt to devise a strategy for their single 
game. The grandmaster can arrive at a board and irrespective of the progress of the 
game, look at the board configuration, immediately recognise it and recall the best 
move for that configuration. That process then can be repeated for the remaining 
boards. A novel game strategy does not need to be devised for each board. In con-
trast, the grandmaster’s opponents do need to devise a novel strategy for their 
single game. In the absence of relevant information stored in long-term memory 
indicating the best move for each configuration, either a strategy or more probably 
random moves (see below) will be needed by less-knowledgeable players.
The findings associated with the game of chess are not, of course, unique. The 
cognitive processes associated with chess skill can be expected to apply to every 
area requiring biologically secondary knowledge. In particular, topics taught in 
educational institutions can be expected to have similar cognitive profiles as found 
in chess. In any biologically secondary area, we can expect the major, possibly sole 
difference between novices and experts to consist of differential knowledge held in 
long-term memory. Increased problem-solving skill should be directly caused by 
increased knowledge of relevant problem states and their associated moves rather 
than due to the acquisition of unspecified, general problem-solving strategies.
All of the readers of this book have skills similar to those exhibited by chess 
grandmasters. The only difference is that those skills are, for most people, in fields 
other than chess. If readers were asked to look at the last sentence for about 5 s and 
then replicate the very large number of letters that constitute that sentence, most 
could do so easily and accurately. Similar to the chess results, that skill disappears 
for randomly ordered letters. Replicating the letters of a sentence is in principle, no 
different to replicating the pieces from a chess board taken from a real game. The 
only difference is that educated people spend many years practicing reading while 
chess grandmasters spend many years practicing and studying chess. The cognitive 
consequences are identical.
As might be expected, findings similar to those obtained in chess have been 
obtained in many areas including understanding and remembering text (Chiesi, 
Spilich, & Voss, 1979), electronic engineering (Egan & Schwartz, 1979), program-
ming (Jeffries, Turner, Polson, & Atwood, 1981) and algebra (Sweller & Cooper, 
1985). These findings have important instructional implications that in conjunction 

22
2 Amassing Information: The Information Store Principle
with other aspects of human cognitive architecture discussed below have guided the 
instructional processes discussed in this book.
De Groot’s findings not only have implications for instruction, they also 
provide us with vital information concerning the nature of human cognition and 
in the process have the potential to change our view of ourselves. De Groot’s 
results provide us with some of the most important findings to be found in the 
field of human cognition. Humans may have a natural tendency to consider 
long-term memory as little more than fairly limited sets of isolated facts and 
incidents. Long-term memory can easily be considered to have a quite periph-
eral role in really important aspects of human cognition such as problem solv-
ing and thinking. De Groot’s findings turn this view on its head. The function 
of long-term memory is vastly more important than simply enabling us to recall 
events, meaningful or otherwise, from our past. Instead, long-term memory is 
not only central to human cognition, but central to those aspects of cognition 
that are seen as representing the apex of the human mind. We require long-term 
memory for all higher-level cognitive activities such as problem solving and 
thinking. Expertise in such high-level cognitive processes is entirely dependent 
on the content of long-term memory. We are competent in an area because of 
information held in long-term memory. Furthermore, that information held in 
long-term memory may be the major reason for competence and skill.
Schema theory. Given the importance of information held in long-term memory, it 
is appropriate to analyse the form in which that information is held. Schema theory 
provides an answer. The theory became important with the work of Piaget (1928) 
and Bartlett (1932). Bartlett described an experiment that clearly indicates the 
nature and function of schemas. He asked one person to read a passage describing 
events from a foreign culture. That person then wrote as much of the passage as 
could be remembered. The remembered passage then was presented to a second 
person with the same instructions; the second person’s written passage then was 
given to a third person etc. This process was repeated until a total of 10 people had 
read and recorded their memory of the previous person’s passage.
Bartlett analysed the changes that occurred from passage to passage. He found 
two effects: levelling or flattening according to which unusual descriptions of events, 
such as descriptions of ghosts that appeared foreign to the readers tended to disap-
pear; and sharpening, according to which descriptions of events that were familiar 
were emphasised. Descriptions of battles that appear commonly in Western literature 
and culture provide an example of features that were sharpened. What was remem-
bered were not the events depicted in the original passage but rather, schematic 
representations of those events. Long-term memory holds countless numbers of 
schemas and those schemas determine how we process incoming information. What 
we see and hear is not determined solely by the information that impinges on our 
senses but to a very large extent by the schemas stored in long-term memory.
Schema theory became increasingly important in the 1980s, providing an 
­explanation of aspects of problem-solving performance. A schema can be defined 
as a cognitive construct that permits us to classify multiple elements of information 
into a single element according to the manner in which the multiple elements are 

23
How Natural Information Processing Systems Store Information
used (Chi, Glaser, & Rees, 1982). Most people who have completed junior high 
school algebra, for example, are likely to have a problem-solving schema that 
­indicates that all problems of the form a/b = c, solve for a, should be solved in the 
same manner, by multiplying both sides of the equation by the denominator on the 
left side (b). Anyone who has acquired this schema will treat this and all similar 
problems requiring a similar solution as the same entity to be treated in the same 
way despite any differences between examples. With sufficient levels of expertise, 
all of the individual elements such as the pro-numerals and the mathematical sym-
bols that constitute this and similar problems are treated as a single element by the 
relevant schema. As a consequence, any information that appears to correspond to 
this schema will be treated in an essentially identical manner. We will attempt to 
solve all problems such as the above algebra problem in a similar manner. In effect, 
the schema provides a template that permits us to effortlessly solve the problem.
The manner in which problem-solving schemas function provides us with 
immense benefits. We are able to solve problems that otherwise would be difficult 
or impossible to solve. Unfortunately, the same processes also have negative con-
sequences that appear unavoidable. Sometimes, a problem will appear to be relevant 
for a particular schema but, in fact, is not relevant. Schemas held in long-term 
memory not only can render difficult problems easy to solve but can render simple 
problems very difficult to solve if the schema is erroneously assumed to provide an 
appropriate template. When we attempt to solve a problem by using an inappropri-
ate schema because the problem looks as though it belongs to a particular category 
of problems but does not belong to that category, we have an example of einstellung 
or mental set (Luchins, 1942; Sweller, 1980; Sweller & Gee, 1978). Schemas stored 
in long-term memory may be essential for us to function but they also can prevent 
us from seeing what would otherwise be obvious.
Automation. Newly acquired schemas must be processed consciously and some­
times with considerable effort. With increasing practice schemas can be used with 
less and less conscious processing. Instead, they can be used automatically and 
largely without effort (Kotovsky, Hayes, & Simon, 1985; Schneider & Shiffrin, 
1977; Shiffrin & Schneider, 1977). Our ability to read provides a clear example. 
Initially, when we are learning to read, we must consciously process each individual 
letter. With increasing practice, we acquire automated schemas for individual letters 
but still may need to consciously process the groups of letters that constitute words. 
With additional practice, word recognition becomes automated and even groups of 
familiar words can be read without conscious control. With high degrees of automa-
tion, conscious effort may only need to be expended on the meaning of text. Thus, 
competent English readers of this text not only have schemas for individual letters 
that permit the recognition of an infinite number of shapes, including hand-written 
letters, a large combinations of letters that form words, phrases and sentences also 
can be recognised automatically. The lower-level schemas for letters and words 
become increasingly automated with increasing competence and no longer need to 
be consciously processed because they have been automated. In contrast, beginning 
English readers are unlikely to have the same level of automation and will need 
much more effortful processing to fully understand the text.

2 Amassing Information: The Information Store Principle
Instructional Implications
The role of long-term memory in learning and problem solving provides us with a 
purpose and function for instruction. The purpose of instruction is to increase the 
store of knowledge in long-term memory. If nothing has changed in long-term 
memory, nothing has been learned. Instructional procedures that cannot describe 
what has changed in long-term memory run the risk that nothing has changed and 
nothing has been learned.
Not only do we know that an increase in knowledge held in long-term memory 
is central to learning, we now have a much better idea of what is learned and stored 
as a consequence of instruction. While we do store very domain-general concepts 
and procedures in long-term memory, these do not usually provide appropriate 
subject matter for instruction. General problem-solving strategies such as means–
ends analysis must be stored in long-term memory but they cannot easily be the 
subject of instruction because they are acquired automatically and unconsciously 
as part of our biologically primary knowledge. Knowledge that can be the subject 
of instruction tends to be much more narrow. It is domain specific rather than 
domain general.
De Groot’s work on chess indicated the astonishing extent of that specificity. We 
can learn the rules of chess in about 30 min and using those rules, we can theoreti-
cally generate every game that has ever been played and that ever will be played. 
Learning those rules is essential to chess skill but in another sense, it is trivial. Real 
chess skill comes from acquiring automated schemas. Good chess players must 
learn to recognise countless numbers of board configurations and the best moves 
associated with each configuration. Without that knowledge, knowing the rules of 
chess is largely useless. Exactly the same principle applies to learning in every 
­curriculum area. For competence, we must acquire domain-specific schemas in cur-
riculum areas that we wish to learn. While we need to learn the well-defined rules 
of mathematics and science or the more ill-defined rules associated with language-
based disciplines such as literature or history, that knowledge will not take us very 
far. For real competence, we also must learn to recognise large numbers of problem 
states and situations and what actions we should take when faced with those states 
and situations.
De Groot’s lesson should not be forgotten when designing instruction. In areas 
where we have not evolved to acquire knowledge, covered by most curriculum 
areas, knowledge consists of large numbers of domain-specific schemas that 
must be acquired. That knowledge provides a complete description of expertise. 
De Groot did not find that chess grandmasters had vastly superior repertoires of 
general problem-solving strategies, or indeed, cognitive, meta-cognitive, or think-
ing strategies. Furthermore, there is no body of literature demonstrating enhanced 
levels of these skills in expert chess players. We argue that such strategies are likely 
to be biologically primary and so do not need to be taught. Instead of general strate-
gies, chess grandmasters had knowledge of chess board configurations and the best 
moves associated with those configurations. Differing levels of that knowledge are 

25
Conclusions
sufficient to fully explain differing levels of chess expertise. Domain-specific 
knowledge is also sufficient to fully explain expertise in curriculum areas. We must 
carefully consider whether many recently popular instructional techniques associ-
ated with inquiry, problem-based or constructivist learning procedures that do not 
emphasise domain-specific knowledge have any base in our cognitive architecture 
(Kirschner, Sweller, & Clark, 2006). Such techniques appear to proceed without 
reference to long-term memory or any of the other aspects of human cognition 
discussed in the next two chapters.
Conclusions
The information held in the long-term memory store is central to all facets of 
human cognition just as the information held in a genomic store is central to the 
information processes necessary for evolution by natural selection. The immense 
size of these stores is necessary to enable them to function in complex natural 
­environments. A natural information store must be sufficiently large to enable it to 
respond flexibly and appropriately to a very large range of conditions. In the case 
of human cognition, our long-term memory store is sufficiently large to enable the 
variety of cognitive activities, both biologically primary and secondary, engaged in 
by humans. The next issue concerns how natural information stores are acquired. 
That issue is covered by the borrowing and reorganising principle and the random-
ness as genesis principle, covered in Chapter 3.

How do natural information processing systems acquire information? The information 
store principle discussed in Chapter 2 indicates that in order to function in a complex 
environment, natural systems require a massive store of information that can guide 
activity. The manner in which that information is acquired is of immediate interest to 
anyone concerned with instructional design and instructional procedures. One of the 
critical functions of instruction, given the centrality of the information store, is to 
­provide efficient and effective procedures for acquiring the information that is to be 
stored in long-term memory.
As was the case when determining the characteristics of the stores of ­information 
required by natural information systems, we can use evolution by natural selection 
to provide insights into the processes by which natural systems acquire informa-
tion. Those processes can be applied analogically to human cognition. There are 
two basic processes used by natural systems to acquire information: a procedure for 
obtaining organised information from other information stores termed the borrow-
ing and reorganising principle and a procedure for creating novel information 
termed the randomness as genesis principle. This chapter is concerned with these 
two principles.
The Borrowing and Reorganising Principle
The information store requires huge amounts of information. The vast bulk of that 
information is obtained via the borrowing and reorganising principle which applies 
equally to both evolution by natural selection and human cognition.
Biological Evolution
The manner in which information is acquired by a genome is well known. 
Reproduction, either asexual or sexual, provides the process by which almost all 
Chapter 3
Acquiring Information: The Borrowing  
and Reorganising Principle  
and the Randomness as Genesis Principle 

28
3 Acquiring Information: The Borrowing and Reorganising Principle
the information held by a genome is obtained. In the case of asexual reproduction, 
an exact copy of a genome, apart from mutations, is transmitted to all descen-
dents. During asexual reproduction a cell splits into two cells that are identical to 
each other and to the parent cell. In contrast, sexual reproduction is organised to 
ensure that the information held in a genome must, for structural reasons, differ 
from all ancestors. Information is borrowed equally from both male and female 
ancestors and combined to form a unique genome that not only differs from 
all ancestors but also from all current and future genomes with the exception of 
genetically identical siblings. In this manner, sexual reproduction simultaneously 
is able to superimpose variety, novelty and creativity on a process that otherwise 
involves exact transmission.
Asexual reproduction provides a biological example of borrowing without 
reorganising. Each descendant borrows its entire genome from its immediate 
ancestor without alteration. Sexual reproduction provides a biological example 
that includes both borrowing and reorganising. Information is borrowed from 
ancestors during sexual reproduction but it is reorganised during the borrowing 
process to create a novel information store. Each of our cells contains a mix of 
information from both our mother and father. That mix of borrowed and 
­reorganised information results in the creation of a unique individual. We will 
consider analogical processes of borrowing and reorganising in human cognition 
as well as processes requiring borrowing alone.
Human Cognition
The analogy is relatively straightforward. Almost all of the secondary knowledge 
stored in long-term memory is borrowed from other people. This secondary 
knowledge is stored in the long-term memory stores of individuals and can be 
transmitted to other individuals. Our ability to receive such knowledge from others 
and to transmit it most likely depends on a biologically primary skill. It is an 
evolved skill that allows us to communicate that knowledge to each other. For 
example, while learning to read and write are secondary skills, the use of language 
in general and the need to communicate with other people do not need to be 
taught. We have evolved to communicate with other people and do so automati-
cally as a primary skill.
There are several processes we use to communicate. Imitation (Bandura, 1986) 
can be central to many of the activities in which we engage. It is very probably a 
skill based on biologically primary knowledge. We are likely to have evolved to 
imitate other people and do so automatically without being taught. Our propensity 
to imitate is associated with considerable neurological evidence that has become 
available recently via the newly discovered mirror neuron system. While mirror 
neurons fire when we make a movement, interestingly, the same neurons also fire 
when we see other people make the same movement, when we think about a move-
ment or even when we hear a sentence about a particular movement (Grafton, 

29
The Borrowing and Reorganising Principle
Arbib, Fadiga, & Rizzolatti, 1996; Iacoboni et al., 1999; Tettamanti et al., 2005). 
Given these characteristics of the mirror neuron system, it may be plausible to 
­suggest that this system is basic to our propensity and ability to imitate movements 
of other humans. Similar imitative mechanisms may also apply to other cognitive 
activities. Knowing how to imitate other people is not an activity that needs to be 
taught despite the complexity associated with the task. It is a biologically primary 
skill. Imitative activity occurs automatically in humans without instruction because 
it is biologically driven and essential for intellectual development. We have evolved 
our ability to imitate and that ability is used to acquire knowledge.
Not only is our propensity to imitate likely to be biologically primary, much of 
the knowledge that is acquired via imitation is primary knowledge and we are likely 
to acquire most of our primary knowledge through imitation. Nevertheless, imita-
tion also is used in the acquisition of secondary knowledge. Any instructor in any 
educational institution who demonstrates a complex, novel procedure to students is 
relying on the human propensity to imitate. We assume that when we demonstrate 
something to learners that they will assimilate the knowledge associated with that 
demonstration. In other words, we assume that learners will imitate us. The act of 
imitation borrows information from the long-term memory of an instructor to be 
stored in the long-term memory of the learner.
The imitative process, of course, is rarely perfect. The learner already has 
­information in long-term memory and the new information must be combined with 
previously stored information. A process of reorganisation will occur that will 
result in changes to the new information in a manner similar to the changes that 
occur during sexual reproduction. Those changes may be beneficial or may be 
­detrimental and so all deviations from the original, imitated source must be tested 
for effectiveness. Beneficial changes from the original source should be retained 
while detrimental changes should be eliminated. If the changes are sufficiently 
detrimental, the learning episode will have failed. If the deviations from the source 
are neutral or even beneficial, the learning episode is successful.
Imitation is not the only way in which we obtain information from others. 
Nevertheless, it is basic and the other, more common techniques humans use to 
provide each other with biologically secondary information are essentially a deriva-
tive of imitation. Rather than showing people how to do something using the visual 
modality of observation associated with imitation, we can, in effect, ‘show’ people 
how to do something using the auditory modality of speech or its visual equivalent, 
written material. Thus, we not only imitate other people, we also listen and read. In 
an instructional context, our intention when listening or reading is to acquire the 
secondary knowledge held in the long-term memory of others. Almost all of the 
information we acquire in instructional contexts is obtained either by listening, 
reading or looking at diagrams and pictures. When we borrow information from 
others in an instructional context, we do so by listening to what they say, reading 
what they write or studying diagrams or animations that they have produced. In this 
way, information is borrowed from the long-term memories of others and 
­assimilated into our long-term memory. As is the case for direct imitation, the 
transfer of information via procedures related to imitation is never exact. It usually 

30
3 Acquiring Information: The Borrowing and Reorganising Principle
is reorganised and combined with information already held in long-term memory. 
That transformation will either have a negative, neutral or positive effect. If it has a 
negative effect, the information will either have to be transformed further or 
­jettisoned if meaningful learning is to occur. If the transformation has neutral or 
positive effects it can be stored in long-term memory. Of course, misconceptions 
also can be stored in long-term memory if it is not clear that they are misconcep-
tions. Once stored, misconceptions can have negative consequences for extended 
periods unless they are corrected.
The evidence is strong that borrowed information is reorganised. The previous 
chapter on the information store principle indicated that knowledge in long-term 
memory is stored in the form of schemas. Those schemas are borrowed from other 
people and the process of schema acquisition usually involves some degree of 
­reorganisation. Evidence for that process of reorganisation comes from the studies 
by Bartlett (1932) discussed in the previous chapter. As previously discussed we 
reduce or eliminate (flatten) those aspects of the information obtained from others 
that bear little relation to previous knowledge stored in long-term memory while 
emphasising (sharpening) those aspects of the new information that correspond 
with information previously stored. In this way, borrowed information is reor-
ganised when it is combined with current knowledge in long-term memory to 
construct a new schema. The new schema that is constructed is likely to be different 
in informational content to the schema being borrowed.
The process of reorganisation has other characteristics that need to be discussed 
because they are central to the randomness as genesis principle, described below. If 
reorganisation results in novel information, it has an inevitable random component. 
Randomness is necessarily associated with all novel information that is created by 
an individual rather than transmitted from another person’s long-term memory. 
When information, initially obtained from someone else’s long-term memory is 
reorganised into a novel configuration, it is impossible for the individual to have 
prior knowledge indicating whether the reorganised configuration is going to be 
effective. There is no logical procedure available for determining the effectiveness 
of any novel alteration prior to the alteration actually being made. Once the 
­reorganisation has been made, it must be tested for effectiveness but in the absence 
of prior knowledge, the effectiveness of any alteration cannot be determined prior 
to the reorganisation. Effectiveness only can be determined after the event by test-
ing whether the change works as expected.
The logic of novelty whether due to reorganisation or due to other procedures 
(see below) dictates the processes by which creativity occurs. If knowledge 
­concerning the effectiveness of a potential reorganisation is unavailable prior to a 
schema being stored in long-term memory, a random generate and test process is a 
concomitant of the reorganisation process. Reorganisation must be generated 
­randomly and then tested for effectiveness with effective changes retained and 
­ineffective ones jettisoned. It follows that quite different consequences flow from the 
‘borrowing’ aspect and the ‘reorganising’ aspect of the borrowing and reorganising 
principle. The principle ensures that information borrowed with minimal reorganisation 
has a reasonable chance of being high in coherence and fidelity to the ­environment. 

31
Conclusions
Its effectiveness should already have been tested by someone else, although we can 
never be certain when borrowing information from someone else. Information 
obtained from other people always has a risk associated with it even if it is borrowed 
without alteration. Nevertheless, we frequently can and do assume that borrowed 
information without reorganisation already has been tested for ­effectiveness by 
being used to good effect in its environment. The same can never be said of altera-
tions made to that information through reorganisation. We do not and cannot know 
whether those changes are effective prior to the changes being made because they all 
have a random component. They will need to be tested for effectiveness after the 
changes have occurred.
Instructional Implications
The borrowing and reorganising principle provides the major procedure by which 
we obtain knowledge. It is central to instructional design and, indeed, central to 
cognitive load theory. If the principle is valid, the instructional implications are 
clear. We should provide learners with as much relevant information as we are able. 
Withholding information from students based on a version of a constructivist, 
­discovery or problem-based learning theory has no justification. We have evolved 
to obtain information from others and are particularly adept at both providing and 
receiving information. It is difficult to find any aspect of our cognitive architecture 
that suggests learners have an advantage discovering information for themselves. 
Assisting learners to obtain needed information by the use of scaffolding such as 
providing information during problem solving should be beneficial. Providing them 
with that information directly and explicitly should be even more beneficial.
Conclusions
Because the borrowing and reorganising principle provides the major technique by 
which knowledge, both primary and secondary, is stored in the information store, it 
is both central and essential to a natural information store. Without this principle, 
large amounts of knowledge could not be acquired to be stored. For this reason, the 
later chapters of this book dealing with instructional procedures are largely concerned 
with techniques designed to facilitate the acquisition of information from diagrams or 
pictures and written or spoken information. Devising instruction, according to cogni-
tive load theory, means devising instructional procedures that facilitate the borrowing 
of information held by instructors and provided to learners in spoken or visual form.
The borrowing and reorganising principle increases the probability that the 
knowledge held in an information store is likely to be effective. Borrowed informa-
tion has already been organised and is likely to be appropriate for the environment 
for which it is intended because it has already been tested for effectiveness.

32
3 Acquiring Information: The Borrowing and Reorganising Principle
While borrowing information is the primary function of the borrowing and 
­reorganising principle, the manner in which information is borrowed results in a 
degree of creativity. Nevertheless, the borrowing and reorganising principle is not an 
original source of novelty. New information can be created by reorganising ­previously 
stored information and in this way provide a degree of creativity. That creativity 
through reorganisation of old information differs from the creation of totally new 
information. The next principle has the creation of new information as its only goal.
Randomness as Genesis Principle
According to the borrowing and reorganising principle, information is borrowed 
from other, external sources. By what mechanisms is that information created in the 
first instance? While the borrowing and reorganising principle explains how infor-
mation is communicated in natural systems, the randomness as genesis principle 
provides the mechanism by which it is initially created. It provides the creativity 
engine for natural information processing systems by using a random generate and 
test procedure. Accordingly, a random generate and test procedure is the ultimate 
source of all novelty in natural systems.
The suggestion that random generation is at the heart of human creativity may 
be a novel concept when applied to human cognition. Nevertheless, the suggestion 
that all genetic variation has randomness as its origin is both central and accepted 
virtually universally in biology. If our analogy is valid, there is every likelihood that 
human cognition, as a natural system, also will have randomness as a central facet 
in the creation of novel information. We will begin by considering the role of 
­randomness in the creation of novelty in biology.
Biological Evolution
All genetic variation between individual organisms, including individuals belong-
ing to the same or different species, can be traced back to a series of random muta-
tions. We indicated above that sexual reproduction increases variation between 
individuals by ensuring the birth of unique individuals, but it needs to be recognised 
that the unique individuality of offspring has its direct causal differences in the 
male and female alleles that combine during reproduction. If conditions were such 
that male and female alleles were identical, then the reorganisation that occurs 
under the borrowing and reorganising principle could not occur. Sexual reproduc-
tion would not result in any more variation than asexual reproduction and so would 
be pointless because offspring would be identical to their parents. It is solely 
because of the differences between the genetic information obtained from both 
parents that offspring vary from their parents and theoretically, those differences 
can always be traced back to a series of random mutations.

33
Randomness as Genesis Principle
In isolation, random mutation without tests of effectiveness would be useless. It 
is effective because each random mutation is tested for effectiveness. Adaptive 
mutations, those that are effective for survival and reproduction, are retained in the 
information store, the species genome in the case of biological evolution, for future 
use. The vast bulk of mutations are not adaptive. These mutations, that are not 
effective for survival and reproduction, are not stored in the species genome. 
Instead, they are eliminated.
Random mutation is the ultimate source of all variation and so all novelty in 
biology. The massive creativity demonstrated in all biological systems ultimately 
derives from random mutation. That creativity dwarfs anything humans are able to 
produce or to this point, even understand. We have massive research programmes 
attempting to understand biological systems created by random mutation. We could 
not, for example, create a factory able to convert vegetable matter into meat and 
other materials the size of a mouse. The processes of evolution by natural selection, 
along with the other principles associated with biological evolution, have, of 
course, been able to achieve just such an outcome via a long series of random 
mutations.
Based on biological evolution, the general process, random generate and test, is 
a powerful and critical aspect of natural information processing systems. The ran-
domness as genesis principle describes an essential aspect of such systems. We 
might expect it to be equally central to processes used by human cognition when 
creating novel information.
Human Cognition
The role of random mutation in biology provides a particular example of random 
generate and test. Random generate and test during problem solving may play the 
same role in human cognition as random mutation plays in evolution by natural 
selection. Consider a person attempting to solve a novel problem and assume they 
neither have a complete solution to the problem in long-term memory nor are they 
able to access a solution provided by someone else. Where relevant knowledge is 
absent, the only possibility is to randomly attempt one of the possible moves. 
Testing the effectiveness of a move can be accomplished either mentally or physi-
cally. This process of testing the effectiveness of a move without having prior 
knowledge of the outcome of that move is a random generate and test procedure. It 
is unavoidable when knowledge is unavailable. Existing knowledge can be used to 
reduce the number of alternative moves that must be randomly tested but once 
knowledge is exhausted, a random generate and test procedure is all that remains.
Evidence for a random generate and test procedure.  We argue that there are two 
categories of evidence for the use of random generate and test when solving novel 
problems. First, there is some empirical evidence. While solving a complex, 
novel problem, most problem solvers will arrive at many dead ends. Arriving at a 
dead end indicates that the previous move or series of moves was inappropriate. 

34
3 Acquiring Information: The Borrowing and Reorganising Principle
Some dead ends may be due to misconceptions that have been stored in long-term 
­memory. Nevertheless, it can be argued that many may be due to random generation 
of moves. Where misconceptions can be eliminated as a cause of problem-solving 
dead ends, there is currently only one clear explanation for dead ends with alternative 
explanations unavailable. We can expect moves generated randomly to result in many 
dead ends and it is difficult to find any other procedure that will have a similar result. 
Each dead end indicates that somewhere along the previous chain of moves at least 
one move was executed randomly to determine if it could lead to the solution. The 
greater the amount of previously stored knowledge is used to generate moves, the 
fewer dead ends can be expected to occur. Dead ends provide possible empirical 
evidence for the use of a random generate and test procedure during problem solving.
The second and possibly more important evidence for the use of a random gener-
ate and test procedure as a problem-solving strategy comes from a logical argument 
rather than from empirical evidence. We assume all problem-solving moves when 
solving novel problems are generated by (a) a random generate and test procedure, 
(b) knowledge held in long-term memory or (c) almost universally, some combina-
tion of (a) and (b). If these three alternatives are the only ones available, it follows 
that when solving a problem, at those points where knowledge is unavailable to 
distinguish between possible moves in terms of their likelihood of success, the only 
possible strategy available is a random generate and test procedure. If there are 
alternatives to knowledge and a random generate and test procedure as mechanisms 
for generating moves, they have not as yet been identified. Until alternatives are 
generated with evidence that they exist, we should assume that a combination of 
knowledge and random generate and test is the only available procedure for gener-
ating problem-solving moves.
It might be argued that problem-solving strategies such as analogical problem 
solving provide an alternative to knowledge and a random generate and test proce-
dure. In fact, demonstrating that analogical problem solving can be decomposed 
into a combination of knowledge and random generate and test is quite straightfor-
ward. When using analogical problem solving, we must determine a suitable 
­analogy. We will use our knowledge of problem-solving surface and deep structure 
to make the choice. Nevertheless, if the target problem is novel, we can never be 
certain that the analogy will work. Certainty can only come from knowledge. When 
we try to solve the target problem by analogy to a source problem, there is an 
­inevitable random generate and test aspect. The analogy may be perfect but it also 
may be totally useless – a dead end. We can determine the effectiveness of the 
­analogy only after we have tried it and acquired knowledge of its effectiveness. If 
it is effective, we can use that procedure subsequently. If it is not effective, we must 
go back to the drawing board. Choosing an analogy is a problem-solving move no 
different from any other problem-solving move. It requires a combination of knowl-
edge and random generate and test.
A consequence of a random generate and test procedure.  In the previous section  
it was indicated that we cannot know the outcome of choosing a source problem 
analogy that has random components until after the choice has been made and 
tested. This lack of knowledge is general and has structural implications. When a 

35
Randomness as Genesis Principle
move is randomly generated, its outcome is unknown until after the move has been 
made, either mentally or physically. We only can determine the effectiveness of a 
random move after physically or mentally making that move. By definition, we do 
not have knowledge prior to making a random move that can indicate to us the 
consequences of making that move. It is only after randomly choosing a move that 
we can determine its effectiveness. If a move is effective we may retain it and 
­continue the problem-solving process by choosing a subsequent move either by 
using knowledge if it is available or by randomly choosing another move. If a move 
is ineffective in helping us reach a goal because it either takes us further from the 
goal or because it results in a dead end, it is jettisoned. Effective moves can be 
stored in long-term memory for subsequent use. They become knowledge.
Knowledge as a central executive. The cognitive architecture used by cognitive 
load theory does not postulate nor need an independent central executive (Sweller, 
2003). A central executive is a structure that organises and controls cognitive 
­processes. During problem solving, knowledge indicates which moves should be 
made and when and how they should be made. In effect, knowledge held in long-
term memory acts as a substitute for an independent central executive. In the 
absence of knowledge, a random generate and test procedure is used instead.
It can be argued that there is no conceivable central executive, apart from long-
term memory, in the human cognitive system. Nevertheless, central executives are 
postulated in cognitive theories, with Baddeley’s (1992) working memory theory 
providing the best example. We argue that an independent central executive dissoci-
ated from knowledge held in long-term memory results in an infinite regress of 
central executives. If knowledge held in long-term memory does not have the attri-
butes normally attributed to a central executive, we are immediately faced with the 
question of how a knowledge-independent central executive determines its actions. 
We require another central executive governing the first central executive that in 
turn requires a third central executive, etc. The problem is eliminated by assuming 
that knowledge in long-term memory acts as a de facto central executive with both 
the borrowing and reorganising and the randomness as genesis principles explain-
ing how knowledge is acquired.
The analogy with evolution by natural selection becomes particularly valuable 
at this point. Evolution does not require a central executive to function. If the anal-
ogy of human cognition to evolution is valid, human cognition does not require a 
knowledge-free, independent, central executive either. A combination of knowl-
edge held in long-term memory and a random generate and test procedure is 
required for a functioning natural information processing system.
Creativity.  Based on this analysis, the randomness as genesis principle is the  
source of creativity. It is uncontroversially the ultimate source of all variation and 
hence creativity in biological evolution. Random mutations are assumed to provide 
the bedrock of all genetic variation and hence the major source of the immense 
creativity demonstrated in biological systems and explained by evolution by natural 
selection. We suggest random generate and test during problem solving plays an 
identical role in human cognition. If so, random generate and test provides the 
ultimate source of all novel concepts and procedures invented by humans.

36
3 Acquiring Information: The Borrowing and Reorganising Principle
There may be objections to characterising creativity in terms of a random 
­generate and test process. Nevertheless, even ignoring the analogy with evolution 
by natural selection, we argue that the rationale is compelling. Creativity, on any 
definition, requires a move into the unknown. If something is new, if it is an idea, 
object, concept or procedure that has not been produced before, its development 
cannot rely entirely on knowledge already held in long-term memory. It must go 
beyond current knowledge. Apart from the reorganisation that constitutes part of 
the borrowing and reorganising principle, how can we go beyond already stored 
knowledge? Any ‘move’ or process in which we engage must have a procedure by 
which it is generated. We know it can be generated randomly but if it is not gener-
ated randomly, what other procedure is available? Until an alternative procedure is 
described, we should assume that random generation is the sole available process. 
Human creativity may be just as reliant on random generate and test as is evolution 
by natural selection.
Why do individuals differ in creativity if at its source it consists of random 
­generate and test? The answer lies in our knowledge base. The knowledge base held 
by individuals differs immensely. Random generate and test from a low knowledge 
base will lead to vastly different outcomes than random generate and test from a 
much higher knowledge base. If we know the properties of electricity and of materi-
als through which electricity flows, we may have a chance of inventing a light bulb 
by randomly testing many different materials as suitable elements for a light bulb. If 
we do not know those properties, we have no chance of inventing a light bulb.
On this analysis, differences in domain-specific knowledge may go further in 
explaining differences in human creativity than any other factor. Furthermore, 
domain-specific knowledge, unlike general problem-solving strategies, is both 
learnable and teachable.
Instructional Implications
If differences in human creativity rely heavily on domain-specific knowledge, then 
attempts to enhance creativity by means other than increasing domain-specific knowl-
edge are likely to be difficult. According to the randomness as genesis principle, we 
would need to encourage learners to engage in a process of random generate and test. 
Since random generate and test may have been part of human cognitive history for 
countless generations, it is likely to have heavier biologically primary than secondary 
components. If so, the possibility of teaching random generate and test may be 
severely restricted because we may automatically use the technique. The history of 
research into enhancing human creativity bears out this supposition (Sweller, 2009b). 
It is difficult to find successful examples of creativity enhancing procedures.
There may be one exception. The technique of brainstorming, invented by 
Osborn (1953), appears to encourage random generation. Brainstorming requires 
people to generate as many ideas as possible without reference to their possible 
usefulness until later. The technique has never been associated with any viable 

37
Conclusions
cognitive architecture as far as we are aware but since it appears to consist of 
­random generation without testing, it may be possible to relate the procedure to 
aspects of the randomness as genesis principle. Asking people to brainstorm may 
be equivalent to asking them to randomly generate problem-solving moves.
There is some evidence that instructions to brainstorm do result in more usable 
ideas (Meadow, Parnes, & Reese, 1959) and so brainstorming may be an example 
of successfully teaching problem solvers to use a random generation procedure. 
Whether the technique can be useful in areas that are normally the subject of 
instruction remains to be seen. The bulk of the research on brainstorming has used 
idea-generation tasks such as ‘Think of as many uses of a brick as you can’. 
Nevertheless, it seems reasonable to assume that brainstorming instructions also 
should be effective in educationally relevant areas such as mathematical problem 
solving and our research in such areas is currently obtaining promising results.
Conclusions
The borrowing and reorganising principle and the randomness as genesis principle 
provide the two basic, natural information processing system principles associated 
with the acquisition of information to be stored in an information store, either a 
genome in the case of evolution by natural selection or long-term memory in the 
case of human cognition. The two principles work together. Information can be 
communicated over time and space by the borrowing and reorganising principle. 
Natural information processing systems require very large information stores and 
the borrowing and reorganising principle provides an effective procedure that 
explains how such large amounts of information can be acquired. Most novel infor-
mation originates from the randomness as genesis principle with some originating 
from the reorganising function of the borrowing and reorganising principle. Thus, 
together, the randomness as genesis and the borrowing and reorganising principles 
explain how information is created, transmitted and then stored in the information 
store – long-term memory in the case of human cognition.
We generate novel information during problem solving via a random generate 
and test process. At present, alternatives to random generate and test as a novel 
information generating process are not available. They will never become available 
if they do not exist. If so, the randomness as genesis principle may be the sole 
­procedure available that can account for the generation of novel information by 
humans, just as it is the only procedure used by biological evolution to explain 
biological variation.
The reason for the primacy of random generate and test as a generator of novel 
information needs to be emphasised. If there is no logically possible central execu-
tive that can direct the creation of novel information, an alternative is required. 
Random generate and test provides that alternative. If a central executive not based 
on information held in an information store could be specified without an infinite 
regress of multiple executives, random generate and test would not hold its position 

38
3 Acquiring Information: The Borrowing and Reorganising Principle
of primacy. Random generation avoids an infinite regress and in addition, generates 
novel information. It may be a requirement of novelty in both human cognition and 
evolution by natural selection.
The information stored in either human long-term memory or a genome and 
communicated by the borrowing and reorganising principle is ordered and func-
tional. It may appear paradoxical that order has random generation as its genesis 
and indeed that paradox has been an explicit source of rejection of evolution by 
natural selection as the source of biological diversity by those who seek other, non-
scientific explanations of the existence of species. This paradox is resolved by the 
second part of random generate and test. If information were to be randomly gener-
ated without a test of its effectiveness, it would indeed be largely useless. Most of 
the novel information generated randomly by both evolution by natural selection 
and human cognition is, in fact, not adaptive. It is non-functional and cannot be 
used. When we attempt to solve a novel, difficult problem, most of our moves do 
not lead to a successful solution but rather, to dead ends, in just the same way as 
only a tiny percentage of genetic mutations are advantageous with most being 
­deleterious. The immense power of random generation to lead to useable novelty 
only can become apparent if it is followed by a test of each outcome for effective-
ness with effective processes retained and ineffective ones jettisoned. An outcome 
of usable, novel information only can occur if a test is added to random generation. 
Furthermore, in natural information processing systems such as human cognition, 
not only can random generation and test create novelty, it may be the only way of 
creating true novelty just as random mutation is the only way in which evolution by 
natural selection creates true novelty.
While the information store principle explains the need for natural information 
processing systems to store large amounts of information and the borrowing and 
reorganising and the randomness as genesis principles explain the processes that 
allow systems to acquire a large store of information tested for effectiveness, we 
also require procedures by which natural information processing systems interact 
with the external world. The borrowing and reorganising principle indicates that 
large amounts of information are obtained from the external world but the struc-
tures and processes by which that information is obtained need to be specified. 
The two principles discussed in the next chapter, the narrow limits of change 
principle and the environmental organising and linking principle, are concerned 
with the procedures by which natural information processing systems interact 
with their environment.

The previous chapters indicated that when dealing with biologically secondary 
information, human cognition requires a very large information store in order to 
function. Long-term memory constitutes that store. The bulk of the information 
held in long-term memory is acquired by borrowing information from other peo-
ple’s long-term memories with smaller amounts of original information created by 
a random generate and test procedure. The ultimate purpose of this information, 
both borrowed and created, is to allow us to interact with the external environment. 
Chapter 4 specifies the required machinery.
In order to function, natural information processing systems need to interact 
with the external environment by obtaining information from the environment and 
by performing appropriately within an environment. The characteristics required by 
a natural information processing system to obtain information from the environ-
ment are collectively termed the narrow limits of change principle. The character-
istics required for a system to perform appropriately within an environment are 
likewise collectively termed the environmental organising and linking principle. 
These two principles provide the links between natural information processing 
systems and their environments. They are central to cognitive load theory and lead 
directly to the instructional effects covered in the latter parts of this book. When 
dealing with human cognition, both principles are concerned with human working 
memory. When dealing with evolution by natural selection, they apply to the epi-
genetic system (Jablonka & Lamb, 2005; West-Eberhard, 2003) which plays an 
analogous role to human working memory. The epigenetic system is a chemical 
system that can affect the location and rate of mutations and that can turn genes on 
or off depending on environmental signals. Both working memory and the epige-
netic system can be thought of as an interface between the information store and its 
external environment.

4 Interacting with the External Environment: The Narrow Limits of Change Principle
Narrow Limits of Change Principle
The randomness as genesis principle with its emphasis on random generate and test 
has structural consequences for the manner in which information is obtained from the 
external environment. By definition, randomly generated information is not organised 
and there are limits to the amount of unorganised information that a processing 
system can handle. Those limits can be readily demonstrated mathematically.
Assume the system must handle three elements of information where an element 
is anything that needs to be processed. By the logic of permutations, there are 3! = 6 
possible permutations of three elements and so the system needs to consider which 
of these six permutations are appropriate for its environment. Dealing with six pos-
sible permutations should not overwhelm the system. In contrast, assume that rather 
than having to deal with three elements of information, the system must deal with 
ten elements. There are 10! = 3,628,800 permutations of ten elements, a number 
that any system may have considerable difficulty handling.
Given the combinatorial explosion that occurs with quite small increases in the 
number of elements that need to be considered, there are advantages to narrowing 
that number. To keep the number of permutations down to manageable levels, we 
might expect that the number of randomly generated elements that a natural infor-
mation processing system can deal with is severely restricted. The narrow limits of 
change principle reflects this imperative when natural information processing sys-
tems obtain information from the external environment. The epigenetic system, in 
the case of evolution by natural selection, and working memory, in the case of 
human cognition, need to be structured in a manner that takes the characteristics of 
randomly generated information into account.
Biological Evolution
Knowledge concerning how genetic systems interact with the external environment 
and, more specifically, obtain information from the external environment is, in 
many ways, still rudimentary. We have used evolution by natural selection as a 
source analogue for human cognition because evolutionary theory and knowledge 
is, in most respects, considerably more detailed than knowledge of human cogni-
tion. When dealing with information obtained by natural information processing 
systems from the external environment, our relative knowledge levels tend to be 
reversed. We know more of how the human cognitive system obtains knowledge 
from the outside world than how the genetic system obtains its equivalent informa-
tion. Nevertheless, we do have some knowledge concerning the flow of information 
from the external environment to the genetic system. This information flow and its 
consequent impact on biological evolution have analogies in human cognition.
In biological evolution, the pertinent processes are controlled by the epigenetic 
system, which plays a role similar to that played by working memory in human 
cognition. The epigenetic system provides an intermediary between the genetic 
system and the external environment. It controls the interaction between the 

41
Narrow Limits of Change Principle
DNA-based genetic system and the environment external to the DNA. Considerably 
less is known of the epigenetic than the genetic system but it is generally assumed 
that they are distinct (Jablonka & Lamb, 1995, 2005; West-Eberhard, 2003) and act 
independently, although they commonly interact.
From an information processing perspective, the epigenetic system has two 
broad functions. First, it selectively processes and transmits information from the 
external environment to the DNA-based genetic system in a manner that can result 
in genetic changes. That function is of concern in the present section covering the 
narrow limits of change principle. The second, and as it happens, better elucidated 
function of the epigenetic system is to use environmental information to determine 
which parts of the genetic system will perform and which will not perform. That 
role of using environmental information to determine how the genetic system func-
tions is dealt with under the next principle, the environmental organising and linking 
principle. In this section, we are concerned with how information from the environ-
ment can change the DNA code of the genetic system, covered by the narrow limits 
of change principle.
The epigenetic system can use the environment to influence where mutations 
occur. Depending on environmental conditions, mutations in some parts of a genome 
can be facilitated while mutations in other areas are inhibited. For example,  
in some organisms, stressful environments which can jeopardise the survival of the 
organism can lead to increases in mutations. Increased mutations in sections of a 
genome that code for products that assist an organism to survive in a new environ-
ment can increase diversity and therefore enhance the chances of survival of the 
species. As another example, the rate of mutation may be thousands of times higher 
than average in sections of a genome that might require high levels of diversity such 
as venom used to capture prey. Not only are mutations facilitated by the epigenetic 
system in locations that can assist survival, the epigenetic system also can ensure 
that those mutations are not repaired.
While the epigenetic system can determine where mutations occur and even the 
rate of mutation, it does not determine the nature of a mutation. The nature of a 
mutation is determined by random generation as discussed under the randomness 
as genesis principle. Because randomness is the ultimate generator of mutations, 
there are, as indicated above, severe limitations to the number of mutations that can 
occur. Successful mutations are rare even under conditions where the rate of muta-
tion is increased by the epigenetic system. During reproduction, most genetic 
information is reproduced precisely. A substantial mutation event is unlikely to be 
adaptive because of the randomness of mutation. Random generate and test must 
be limited to small steps leading to the narrow limits of change principle.
Human Cognition
In human cognition, the structural consequences that flow from the randomness as 
genesis principle and lead to the narrow limits of change principle manifest themselves 
in the characteristics of working memory when dealing with novel information. We are 

42
4 Interacting with the External Environment: The Narrow Limits of Change Principle
only conscious of what is in working memory and for that reason working memory 
can be equated with consciousness. Evidence for the link between consciousness and 
working memory comes from our introspective knowledge of the contents of long-
term memory. We are aware of the large amount of information held in long-term 
memory but we also are aware that at any given time, we are only conscious of a tiny 
portion of that information. That portion consists of any information from long-term 
memory that happens to be in working memory at a particular time. We are unaware 
of the remainder of the contents of long-term memory until they are transferred into 
working memory. Our conscious knowledge extends only to the very small amount of 
information held by working memory at any time and we are unconscious with respect 
to the remaining information held in long-term memory.
Working memory is the primary structure that processes incoming information 
from the environment. Using Atkinson and Shiffrin’s (1968) architecture, informa-
tion first is received and very briefly processed by the various modules of the sensory 
system, depending on whether its modality is visual or auditory. Then, some elements 
of this information are passed on to working memory where it can be consciously 
processed in conjunction with information held in long-term memory. If informa-
tion processed by working memory is to be retained for any length of time, it needs 
to be passed to long-term memory for permanent storage. Once information has been 
stored in long-term memory, it can be returned to working memory and used to 
govern further behaviour, a process that will be discussed in detail under the next 
principle, the environmental organising and linking principle. In this section, dealing 
with the narrow limits of change principle, we are only concerned with how working 
memory deals with novel information originating in the environment and arriving in 
working memory via the sensory system rather than from long-term memory.
The characteristics of working memory when it deals with novel information 
originating from the environment have been extensively studied and are well 
known. Working memory has two prominent and in many ways surprising charac-
teristics that are critical to anyone concerned with instructional design issues. The 
first characteristic of working memory when it deals with novel information is that 
it is very limited in capacity (e.g., Cowan, 2001; Miller, 1956) and the second char-
acteristic is that it is very limited in duration (Peterson & Peterson, 1959). We will 
begin by discussing the capacity limitations.
Only a very limited number of items or elements can be processed in working 
memory. Items can most readily be understood as schemas, although that is not 
how they were originally conceptualised. While there is universal agreement that 
working memory when dealing with novel information is very limited in capacity, 
the exact limits have been open to some discussion, probably because those limits 
change slightly depending on testing conditions. Miller (1956) suggested that the 
limit was about seven items but more recently Cowan (2001) suggested about four 
items was a more representative figure. From an instructional perspective, the exact 
figure is probably irrelevant because the important point is that working memory is 
severely limited in its ability to store information.
In fact, when dealing with instructional considerations, the limitations of 
working memory are considerably narrower than is suggested by most measures 

43
Narrow Limits of Change Principle
of working memory capacity. Frequently, working memory capacity measures 
incorporate our ability to remember random collections of items such as words, 
digits or letters. Normally, in instructional contexts, we do not use working memory 
to store such items because we do not characteristically use working memory to 
store information of any kind. Instead, working memory is used to process items 
where processing requires organising, combining, comparing or manipulating 
items of information in some manner. The only storage normally required of work-
ing memory is maintenance storage of, for example, intermediate products of cog-
nitive operations. For this reason, working memory does have a storage function as 
well as its primary processing function.
We are likely to be able to process far fewer items of information than we can 
store, depending on the nature of the processing. We suggest that no more than 
two to three items of novel information can be processed by working memory at 
a given time. If we are required to process any more items of novel information, 
our working memory processing system tends to break down. When processing 
novel information, the capacity of working memory is extremely limited. We 
suggest the reason for that limit is the combinatorial explosion that occurs with 
even small increases in the number of elements with which working memory 
must deal.
Most of us are intuitively aware of the storage limitations of working memory. 
We know, for example, that if we must remember a new number such as a telephone 
number that we are dialling that has more than about seven digits, we are unlikely 
to be able to remember that number and will need to return to the written version 
at least once while dialling. We may be less aware that if we have difficulty under-
standing an explanation or solving a difficult problem, that the reason is also due to 
the processing limitations of working memory. Those processing limitations should 
be a major consideration when designing instructions, as will be explained in the 
later chapters of this book.
The limitations of working memory are not restricted to its capacity. Working 
memory also is limited in duration. The temporal limitations of working memory 
were addressed by Peterson and Peterson (1959). Most novel information only can 
be held in working memory for a few seconds before being lost with almost all 
information lost after about 20 s. We can avoid this loss by rehearsal. If we con-
stantly rehearse new material, it is refreshed and can be held in working memory 
indefinitely.
As was the case for capacity limitations, we can obtain an intuitive feeling for 
working memory’s temporal limitations by considering what we do when dialling 
a new telephone number. If we are unable to dial the number immediately, we will 
rehearse it until it is dialled. We know that we must rehearse the number because if 
it is not rehearsed, it will be lost from working memory rapidly. Similarly, if we 
obtain information that must be processed as part of an explanation or problem, if 
it cannot be processed almost immediately, it will be lost to further processing later 
and that loss may severely compromise understanding or problem solving. 
Rehearsal also has the added advantage of assisting in the transfer of information 
to long-term memory.

4 Interacting with the External Environment: The Narrow Limits of Change Principle
Working memory’s capacity and duration limits only apply to novel information 
obtained from the external environment via sensory memory rather than from long-
term memory. These limitations do not apply to familiar information obtained from 
long-term memory. Working memory has dramatically different characteristics 
when dealing with familiar rather than novel information. These characteristics will 
be discussed under the next principle, the environmental organising and linking 
principle.
Working memory and the modality of information.  While sometimes it is convenient 
to consider working memory as a unitary structure, it is more accurate to think of 
working memory as consisting of multiple processors that correspond to the modality 
of information being received. For example, the working memory processor that 
deals with auditory information is different from the processor that deals with 
visual information. There are instructional implications to be discussed subse-
quently that depend on the multi-channel characteristic of working memory.
Baddeley’s theory is the best known, multi-channel working memory theory 
(e.g., Baddeley, 1992). He divides working memory into three components: a central 
executive, a visual-spatial sketchpad and an auditory loop. (More recently, he has 
added an episodic buffer to the model.) As we indicated in the previous chapter, we 
have doubts concerning the viability of a central executive because it leads to an 
infinite regress of executives and would prefer the role of a central executive to be 
allocated to long-term memory. In contrast, a division of working memory into 
partially independent auditory and visual components is not associated with the 
same issues concerning logical status and has considerable empirical support 
(Penney, 1989). We do seem to have different processors to handle visual and audi-
tory information and those processors seem to be partially, although not wholly, 
independent. Both processors share the characteristics we discussed above with 
both having capacity and duration limitations. Under some circumstances, to be 
discussed in subsequent chapters, effective working memory capacity may be 
increased by using both processors. For this reason, the division of working 
memory into separate auditory and visual processors has important instructional 
implications.
Instructional Implications
There are many specific instructional implications that flow from the capacity 
and duration limitations of working memory and this book, through cognitive 
load theory and categories of cognitive load (Part III) and the cognitive load 
theory instructional effects (Part IV), is primarily concerned with those implica-
tions. In general terms, most students are novices and so most of the information 
provided to them is novel and must be processed by a limited capacity, limited 
duration, working memory. The same information usually can be presented in  
a variety of ways with a variety of activities required of learners. In other words, a 
variety of instructional designs can be associated with the same curriculum ­material. 

45
Conclusions
Each form of presentation, each activity required of learners, will impose a working 
memory or cognitive load. (The two terms are used synonymously throughout this 
book.) That load will vary with variations in instructional design and so instruc-
tional designs should be chosen that reduce an unnecessary cognitive load. Given 
the limitations of working memory, one aim of instruction should be to reduce 
unnecessary working memory load and ensure that scarce working memory 
resources are directed to the essentials of the curriculum area and away from activi-
ties that are only required as part of an inadequate instructional design. Directing 
working memory resources to the intrinsic essentials of a curriculum area and away 
from extraneous aspects is the goal of cognitive load theory.
Conclusions
From an evolutionary perspective, our working memory limitations may seem 
counter-intuitive. Why was it necessary for humans to have evolved with such severe 
working memory limitations when faced with unfamiliar information? The current 
framework provides us with an explanation. The narrow limits of change principle 
that incorporates the limitations of working memory flows directly from the ran-
domness as genesis principle. Random generate and test is a necessary aspect of 
dealing with novelty because when faced with novelty, we lack a central executive 
in working memory indicating to us how to organise new information. Therefore the 
absolute number of elements that we must organise becomes a critical factor.  
A small number of elements leads to only a small number of permutations with 
which we must deal. Small increases in that number of elements lead to millions of 
permutations that are effectively impossible to handle. There may be minimal ben-
efit of a working memory that processes more than a very limited number of ele-
ments and so there was no reason for a large working memory to evolve. Given the 
limitations of working memory when dealing with novel information, we require 
instructional procedures that take into account the working memory load imposed 
during instruction, with an aim to reducing unnecessary load.
Working memory in human cognition has a genetic equivalent, the epigenetic 
system, which plays a similar role in evolutionary biology. Both structures permit 
natural information processing systems to process novel, environmental informa-
tion that can eventually be stored in organised form in the information store – long-
term memory in the case of human cognition, a genome in the case of evolution by 
natural selection. Once information is stored in organised form in an information 
store, it can be retrieved from that store by either human working memory or the 
epigenetic system. The characteristics of working memory when dealing with 
organised information from long-term memory or the epigenetic system when 
dealing with organised genomic information are very different to their characteris-
tics when dealing with random information from the environment. Those charac-
teristics are dealt with by the final principle, the environmental organising and 
linking principle, discussed next.

46
4 Interacting with the External Environment: The Narrow Limits of Change Principle
The Environmental Organising and Linking Principle
The four previous principles explain how natural information processing systems 
can obtain and store information either by creating it via a random generate and test 
process or by borrowing already created information, processing that information 
so that only useful information is selected for storage and then storing that informa-
tion in an information store. The previous four principles explain how useful infor-
mation is gathered and stored but the ultimate aim of a natural information 
processing system is not simply to store information. Rather, the ultimate purpose 
of a natural information processing system in storing information is to permit it to 
function in a natural environment.
The environmental organising and linking principle provides that final step and 
in doing so provides the ultimate justification for natural information processing 
systems. Without this principle, natural information processing systems would have 
no function because it is this principle that allows them to coordinate their activities 
with their environment. The environmental organising and linking principle allows 
massive amounts of stored information to be used to determine activity relevant to 
a particular environment.
Biological Evolution
The role of the environmental organising and linking principle in biological evolu-
tion is to permit organised information from a genome to be linked to the environ-
ment and so to ensure that activity is appropriate for the environment. As was the 
case for the narrow limits of change principle, the epigenetic system is central to 
the environmental organising and linking principle. While the narrow limits of 
change principle uses environmental information via the epigenetic system to focus 
mutations at particular times and particular locations, the environmental organising 
and linking principle uses the epigenetic system to marshal vast complexes of 
stored genetic information for specific activities that are relevant to a particular 
environment. The epigenetic system is used to link DNA-based information to the 
external world beyond the DNA.
The environmental organising and linking principle deals with previously 
organised information from the information store in a very different manner to how 
the narrow limits of change principle must deal with novel information. Accordingly, 
the characteristics of the epigenetic system when it deals with environmental infor-
mation to influence mutations via the narrow limits of change principle are very 
different to its characteristics when it assembles genetic information in order to 
affect a particular outcome via the environmental organising and linking principle. 
The most obvious difference is that while there may be limits to the amount of 
novel information in the form of mutations that the epigenetic system can deal with, 
there may be no limits to the amount of previously organised, DNA-based genetic 

47
The Environmental Organising and Linking Principle
material that it can handle. Only very small amounts of novel information that 
might be a candidate for storage in the information store can be processed by the 
epigenetic system. In contrast, huge amounts of previously organised and stored 
information can be handled by the same system.
The role of the epigenetic system can be seen clearly in the manner in which 
genotype, or genetic characteristics, links to phenotype, or physical characteristics. 
It is the epigenetic system that controls that link. Phenotype is determined largely 
by having particular genes activated or silenced and it is the epigenetic system that 
determines whether a gene is turned on or off. Once activated by the epigenetic 
system, a series of chemical reactions result in the production of particular proteins 
and it is those proteins that determine a particular phenotype. All the steps of pro-
tein synthesis are controlled by the epigenetic system. The epigenetic system, in 
turn, is influenced by environmental conditions where the environment is every-
thing external to the genome. Thus, the environment influences the epigenetic 
system that in turn influences which genes will be activated and which will be 
silenced. In this way, the environment determines phenotype or physical 
characteristics.
The importance of the epigenetic system as a conduit between the environment 
and the genome, or information store, can be seen in both the narrow limits of 
change principle and the environmental organising and linking principle. In the 
case of the narrow limits of change principle, the epigenetic system, triggered by 
environmental conditions, can determine where mutations occur and their fre-
quency. In the case of the environmental organising and linking principle, the epi-
genetic system, again triggered by the environment, determines which stored 
genetic information will be used or ignored.
The characteristics of the epigenetic system in its two roles are very different. 
Mutations, even when accelerated, result in very small genetic changes. In contrast, 
the amount of genetic material that may be required to allow a particular phenotype 
to be expressed appears to have no limit. Huge amounts of genetic information may 
be organised by the epigenetic system to determine a particular phenotype. The 
epigenetic system is able to organise large amounts of information because the 
information is already organised in the genome. That organised information can be 
treated as a single, large block (a gene or several genes) that acts in concert deter-
mining phenotype.
An intuitive feel for the critical influence of the epigenetic system can be seen 
when one considers the variety of cells in the human body. All cells in the human 
body that contain a nucleus have an identical DNA structure despite physical dif-
ferences that can be immense. A liver cell bears little relation in structure and func-
tion to a kidney cell. These differences are not due to genetic differences because 
both liver and kidney cells for a given individual have identical DNA. Factors other 
than DNA must cause the differences between the cells. The differences are due to 
environmental factors switching various genes on or off via the epigenetic system. 
Once triggered by the environment, massive amounts of DNA-based information 
can be used by the epigenetic system to determine the type of cell that will be 
produced.

48
4 Interacting with the External Environment: The Narrow Limits of Change Principle
Human Cognition
As was the case for the other principles, the environmental organising and linking 
principle plays a role in human cognition analogous to its role in biological evolu-
tion. In both biological evolution and human cognition, through the environmental 
organising and linking principle, information held in the information store is used 
to ensure that activity is appropriately coordinated with the environment. The rel-
evant cognitive structure that governs that coordination is working memory, the 
structure that also is central to the narrow limits of change principle. While working 
memory is central to both principles, its properties when dealing with familiar 
information held in long-term memory are vastly different to its properties when it 
is used to acquire novel information.
When discussing the narrow limits of change principle, it was pointed out that 
working memory was severely limited in capacity and duration. The suggested 
reason for that limitation is that novel information from the environment cannot 
have a central executive to provide organisation. Instead, random generate and test 
acts as a substitute for a central executive and random generation must be limited 
in order to prevent combinatorial explosions.
Working memory, as well as receiving environmental information via the sen-
sory system, also interacts with and receives previously stored, organised informa-
tion from long-term memory that is used to coordinate activity with the environment. 
Stored information held in long-term memory is very different from information 
received from the environment. Stored information is organised, not random, and 
can be treated substantially differently. While random information must be limited 
to prevent combinatorial explosions, limitations on the amount of organised infor-
mation that can be dealt with by working memory are unnecessary. Combinatorial 
explosions cannot occur because the manner in which the information is combined 
is already established. Consequently, the amount of organised information from 
long-term memory that can be dealt with by working memory has no known limits. 
Similarly, there are no known limits to the duration that information from long-term 
memory can be held in working memory.
The immense differences in the characteristics of working memory when 
dealing with information from sensory memory as opposed to information from 
long-term memory led Ericsson and Kintsch (1995) to postulate a new processor 
when working memory deals with organised information from long-term memory, 
that they called ‘long-term working memory’. The most important characteristics 
of long-term working memory are that it has no obvious capacity or duration limits, 
in stark contrast to the severe limits of working memory when dealing with novel 
information. While in this book we will treat working memory as a single structure 
with different properties depending on whether it is dealing with information from 
the environment via sensory memory or with information from long-term memory, 
it makes just as much sense to consider two separate structures, working memory 
and long-term working memory. For present purposes, it makes no difference 
whether long-term working memory is treated as a subset of working memory or 

49
The Environmental Organising and Linking Principle
whether they are treated as two separate entities. The instructional implications are 
identical for both formulations.
Working memory obtains information from long-term memory in order to pro-
vide an organised link to the environment. The environmental organising and link-
ing principle allows organised information to be transferred from long-term memory 
to working memory in order for that information to be used by working memory to 
coordinate activity in a manner that is appropriate for a given environment. Rather 
than working memory receiving information from the environment via sensory 
memory and processing that information for possible storage as occurs under the 
narrow limits of change principle, working memory receives environmentally 
appropriate information from long-term memory under the environmental organis-
ing and linking principle.
The analogy between biological evolution and the human cognitive system is 
particularly close at this point. The epigenetic system requires a trigger from the 
environment to turn specific genes on or off. Similarly, working memory depends 
on environmental cues to determine which information from long-term memory 
will or will not be retrieved and used. Environmental information is used by work-
ing memory as a trigger to use some information from long-term memory but 
ignore other information just as environmental information is used by the epige-
netic system to determine which information from a genome will or will not be 
used. By using the environment as a trigger to select information from long-term 
memory, an appropriate coordination between the environment and activity is 
ensured in the same way as the epigenetic system ensures appropriate coordination 
between the environment and biological activity.
In this manner, information in long-term memory does not become active until 
it has been triggered by cues from the environment that induce working memory to 
choose one set of schemas over another. For example, we may have a schema held 
in long-term memory that permits us to recognise problems of the form (a + b)/c = d, 
solve for a. That schema lies dormant until we see this equation. Once seen, the 
equation acts as a cue triggering the schema that tells us what action to take.
In that sense, the environment informs us which of the multitude of schemas 
held by long-term memory are appropriate. Once environmental information trig-
gers working memory to choose a particular set of schemas held in long-term 
memory, those schemas can be used to govern complex behaviour that is appropriate 
for that environment. In the same sense, once environmental information triggers 
the epigenetic system to activate a particular set of genes held in a genome, those 
genes can be used to govern complex behaviour that is appropriate for the environ-
ment. Thus, via the environmental organising and linking principle, information in 
long-term memory or a genome is chosen by working memory or the epigenetic 
system to determine activity in a given environment.
Under the discussion of the narrow limits of change principle, it was pointed out 
that when dealing with unorganised, novel information, there are evolutionary 
advantages to having a limited working memory. When dealing with organised, 
familiar information, there are equal evolutionary advantages in having an unlimited 
working memory. If we have a large number of complex, organised clusters of 

50
4 Interacting with the External Environment: The Narrow Limits of Change Principle
information (schemas) in long-term memory that are available for transfer to 
working memory, then we are likely to have a large number of environmental 
circumstances that we can deal with. For example, learning the layout of a locality 
enables us to easily and rapidly move around without getting lost. That knowledge 
has evolutionary advantages and those advantages are likely to increase with 
increases in the size of the locality with which we are able to become familiar.
Instructional Implications
As might be expected, the environmental organising and linking principle serves a 
critical function in education. A major purpose of education is to permit us to per-
form appropriately in our environment, requiring us to selectively access informa-
tion from long-term memory. Without our ability to transfer large amounts of 
familiar information from long-term to working memory, there would be little pur-
pose to education. The current activity of readers of this book provides a clear 
example. In a purely physical sense, readers are simply faced with an immensely 
complex page of squiggles. Those squiggles are important only because they act as 
an environmental trigger. We derive meaning from them because we have spent 
years or decades acquiring the information stored in long-term memory that permits 
us to connect those squiggles to the external world via the environmental organising 
and linking principle. The squiggles are used as a trigger by working memory to 
transfer schemas from long-term memory. Those schemas then can be used to 
derive meaning.
Conclusions
The environmental organising and linking principle provides the final step in 
permitting a natural information processing system to function in a given environ-
ment. It also provides the primary justification for a natural information processing 
system. In a very real sense, the previous principles only are necessary in order to 
permit the environmental organising and linking principle to function. It is this 
principle that ultimately allows us to perform in our environment. Without the 
environmental organising and linking principle, there would be no purpose to creat-
ing novel information through the randomness as genesis and narrow limits of 
change principles, no purpose to storing that information in an information store or 
transferring that information to other stores via the borrowing and reorganising 
principle. All of these principles and the processes they cover are required for the 
environmental organising and linking principle to serve its function of allowing a 
natural information processing system to function appropriately in its environment. 
We can function, both cognitively and biologically, in our complex world, because 
of the environmental organising and linking principle.

Summary of Structures and Functions of Human Cognitive Architecture
Summary of Structures and Functions of Human Cognitive 
Architecture
Part II has outlined a version of human cognitive architecture by describing five 
basic principles that together can also be used to describe a natural information 
processing system. Since human cognition can be considered a natural informa-
tion processing system, those five principles provide us with a human cognitive 
architecture. In this section, that architecture has been used to indicate some gen-
eral instructional recommendations. A series of specific instructional recommen-
dations will be outlined in Part IV following an outline of cognitive load theory 
described in Part III. Cognitive load theory is based on the current cognitive 
architecture.
Human cognitive architecture can be considered to be a natural information 
processing system that has been generated by biological evolution. Biological evo-
lution also can be considered to be a natural information processing system and so 
both systems are governed by the same underlying principles. Those principles can 
be used to specify the aspects of human cognitive architecture that are relevant to 
instruction, specifically those aspects that deal with biologically secondary knowl-
edge. All five of the natural information processing system principles discussed 
above are required to specify how secondary or teachable knowledge is acquired 
and used while only a few of the principles are needed to indicate how biologically 
primary knowledge is acquired and used.
The information store principle is equally important when dealing either with 
primary or secondary knowledge. Both categories of knowledge must be stored in 
an information store in essentially the same way and, as far as we are aware, there 
is no evidence indicating that the store differs depending on the nature of the 
knowledge stored. Unless evidence becomes available suggesting different storage 
requirements for primary and secondary knowledge, we should assume that both 
categories of knowledge are held in the same store.
Much primary knowledge, such as language acquisition, probably is acquired 
through imitation, indicating that the borrowing component of the borrowing and 
reorganising principle is important in the acquisition of primary, as well as secondary 
knowledge. The reorganisation component of the principle may play a much more 
limited role in the acquisition of primary knowledge. Primary knowledge is modu-
lar in that we have evolved to acquire very specific categories of such knowledge 
that will automatically be acquired under appropriate environmental conditions. 
While borrowing may be central when acquiring primary knowledge, that 
borrowed information may undergo little if any reorganisation. Primary knowledge 
may undergo minimal reorganisation when assimilated to previously acquired sche-
mas. In contrast, secondary knowledge can undergo substantial reorganisation 
when it is assimilated via the borrowing and reorganising principle. Usually, that 
reorganisation can be beneficial. Nevertheless sometimes, what a learner ‘borrows’ 
when listening or reading may bear little relation to the original information being 
presented leading to misunderstandings and misconceptions.

52
4 Interacting with the External Environment: The Narrow Limits of Change Principle
Both the randomness as genesis and narrow limits of change principles are critical 
to biologically secondary knowledge but may have no function in the acquisition 
of primary knowledge. We do not have to randomly generate and test novel primary 
knowledge because we rarely create such knowledge. Novel versions of a means–
ends problem-solving strategy or novel ways of recognising faces do not have to be 
randomly generated and tested for effectiveness. We have evolved to only assimi-
late versions of such procedures that are effective.
If random generation is not required for the creation of primary knowledge, 
there is no need for a slow build-up of that knowledge in long-term memory. We 
are assured that primary knowledge is effective and there is minimal risk that the 
rapid acquisition of such knowledge will destroy the functionality of long-term 
memory. Primary information can be acquired quickly in large quantities without a 
need to test its effectiveness. Humans have evolved to acquire that knowledge pre-
cisely because it is effective and must be acquired for normal functioning. For this 
reason, primary knowledge is acquired much faster than secondary knowledge and 
it is acquired without conscious effort and largely without instruction.
The environmental organising and linking principle functions in tandem with the 
information store principle and so, like that principle, applies equally when dealing 
with primary or secondary knowledge. Just as occurs in the case of secondary 
knowledge, large amounts of primary knowledge, once acquired and stored in long-
term memory, can be marshalled to deal appropriately with the environment. 
Primary knowledge, as occurs with secondary knowledge, is acquired and stored in 
long-term memory solely in order to generate activity appropriate to specific envi-
ronments. The purpose of the environmental organising and linking principle when 
dealing with primary knowledge is identical to its purpose when dealing with sec-
ondary knowledge. In both cases, the principle permits a link between knowledge 
held in long-term memory and the external environment.
From this analysis, it can be seen that primary and secondary knowledge are 
stored and used in a similar manner but differ substantially in their acquisition. We 
have evolved to store and use biologically primary and secondary knowledge in a 
similar manner but we acquire the two categories of knowledge in a quite different 
manner using different acquisition systems. Those different acquisition systems 
allow large amounts of primary knowledge to be acquired rapidly and easily with-
out mechanisms to test whether the knowledge is needed and effective. Primary 
knowledge always is needed and effective because we have evolved to need and use 
that knowledge. In contrast, we can survive without secondary knowledge and so 
that knowledge is acquired in a very different manner.
All five natural information processing system principles apply to secondary 
knowledge, including the mechanisms for acquiring that knowledge, because 
unlike the acquisition mechanisms for primary knowledge, we do not have mecha-
nisms for automatically acquiring secondary knowledge. We need specific machinery 
for acquiring secondary knowledge and working memory supplies that machinery. 
For that reason, the principles most closely associated with working memory, the 
randomness as genesis and the narrow limits of change principles, are central to 
the acquisition of secondary knowledge but unimportant in the acquisition of 

53
Summary of Structures and Functions of Human Cognitive Architecture
primary information. Because of the critical importance of working memory in 
the acquisition of secondary knowledge, relations between working memory 
and long-term memory are central to secondary or teachable knowledge. When 
dealing with instructional issues, the relations between working memory and 
long-term memory should be carefully considered, including the transformed 
characteristics of working memory (or long-term working memory) when dealing 
with external information or information from long-term memory.
A major purpose of instruction is to increase usable knowledge in long-term 
memory. Learning is defined as a positive change in long-term memory and so if 
nothing has changed in long-term memory then learning has not occurred. From the 
perspective of our knowledge of cognitive architecture, the purpose of learning is 
to increase the effectiveness of the environmental organising and linking principle. 
The environmental organising and linking principle can be effective only if it has a 
large amount of useful information on which it can draw. Its potential to be func-
tional depends on information held in long-term memory. The most effective way 
to increase information held in long-term memory is through the borrowing and 
reorganising principle and so it follows that instruction should emphasise this prin-
ciple. Of course, the borrowing and reorganising principle can be used only if 
appropriate information is available in another person’s long-term memory from 
which information can be borrowed. If information is not available for borrowing, 
either because another person is not available, either directly or indirectly through 
written or other sources, or even because the required information has not as yet 
been created, the only other solution is to create the information via the randomness 
as genesis principle. We create information very slowly because working memory 
is extremely limited when dealing with new information. The narrow limits of 
change principle ensures that the randomness as genesis principle works very 
slowly. All novel information, whether obtained through the reorganisation compo-
nent of the borrowing and reorganising principle or through the randomness as 
genesis principle, is subject to the limitations of working memory.
These working memory limitations must be taken into account whenever we 
deal with the biologically secondary knowledge that is the subject of instructional 
procedures. Cognitive load theory is an instructional theory that uses this cognitive 
architecture as its base. Accordingly, the relations between working memory and 
long-term memory are critical to the theory. Categories of cognitive load are dis-
cussed in Part III.

Instructional design theories and processes can be anchored by the cognitive 
architecture described in the previous chapters. That architecture is vital. Without 
it, instructional design decisions occur in a vacuum and are based on ideology or 
on individual, personal experience. While personal experience can be valuable, 
there is no substitute for a viable, evidence-supported theory to guide decisions. 
Cognitive load theory, which includes the cognitive architecture described in the 
previous chapters, is intended to provide such a theory.
Human cognitive architecture provides a context that can be used to explain why 
some instructional procedures do or do not work. Based on human cognitive archi-
tecture, we can determine categories of instruction that are likely to be effective. We 
can, for example, hypothesise that very general learning and problem-solving strat-
egies are likely to be biologically primary and so usually do not need to be taught 
because we have evolved to acquire those strategies easily and automatically from 
a very young age. The acquisition of biologically primary knowledge is too impor-
tant and too urgent to be left to the system responsible for gradual, conscious and 
effortful acquisition of biologically secondary knowledge which begins functioning 
at a later age, including through exposure to formal education processes. If very 
general strategies are biologically primary and so do not need to be taught, teaching 
should be restricted to domain-specific knowledge that we have not evolved to 
acquire as biologically primary skills. We also might hypothesise on the basis of the 
cognitive architecture outlined in the previous chapters that teaching domain-spe-
cific knowledge should be direct and explicit because we have evolved to acquire 
knowledge from other people and direct, explicit teaching through use of the bor-
rowing and reorganising principle provides an ideal procedure for obtaining knowl-
edge from others. In addition and critically, from a cognitive load theory perspective, 
we might hypothesise that the limitations of human working memory when acquir-
ing new information need to be considered when designing instruction.
These general suggestions flow from our current knowledge of human cognitive 
architecture. Of course, until rigorously tested, they remain no more than sugges-
tions. When tested as hypotheses, supporting data can be used to advocate particu-
lar instructional procedures. Cognitive load theory has been used for this purpose. 
Based on the cognitive architecture described in the previous chapters, cognitive 
load theory suggests that the major purpose of instruction should be to increase

advantageous biologically secondary knowledge held in long-term memory. 
Furthermore, information presented with that aim in mind needs to take into 
account the limitations of working memory when processing novel, secondary 
information. Information needs to be presented in a manner that attempts to reduce 
unnecessary processing and so cognitive load theory is heavily concerned with 
procedures for presenting novel information to learners in a manner that reduces an 
unnecessary cognitive load while increasing those aspects of cognitive load that 
lead to learning. Chapter 5 is concerned with the categories of cognitive load that 
instructional procedures can impose, while Chapter 6 is concerned with techniques 
for measuring cognitive load.

Learners must process instructional information in working memory. The load 
imposed on working memory by that instructional information can be divided into 
categories depending on its function (Paas, Renkl, & Sweller, 2003, 2004; Sweller, 
van Merriënboer, & Paas, 1998; van Merriënboer & Sweller, 2005). Some of the 
working memory load is imposed by the intrinsic nature of the information and that 
load is called ‘intrinsic cognitive load’. It is imposed by the basic structure of the 
information that the learner needs to acquire for achieving learning goals irrespec-
tive of the instructional procedures used.
Another category of cognitive load that requires working memory resources is 
imposed not by the intrinsic structure of the information but rather by the manner 
in which the information is presented or the activities in which learners must 
engage. In other words, as well as the nature of the instructional material, the nature 
of the instructional design used to present the material can impose a cognitive load 
that under many circumstances can be unnecessary. In the case of the instructional 
design, where the load is unnecessary and extraneous to the learning goals, it is 
called ‘extraneous cognitive load’. This load is imposed solely because of the 
instructional procedures being used.
The cognitive load imposed by the intrinsic nature of the material (intrinsic 
cognitive load) and the manner in which the material is presented (extraneous cog-
nitive load) both must be dealt with by working memory with resources allocated 
to both of these two sources of cognitive load. Resources devoted to the load 
imposed by the intrinsic nature of the material are germane to learning and so can 
be referred to as ‘germane resources’. The term, ‘germane cognitive load’ is 
frequently used to refer to germane resources although it is probably inappropriate 
to use this term. Unlike intrinsic and extraneous cognitive load that are imposed by 
the nature and structure of the learning materials, germane cognitive load is not 
imposed by the learning materials. Rather, it belongs to a different category that can 
be better understood as working memory resources that are devoted to information 
that is relevant or germane to learning. Such information imposes an intrinsic 
cognitive load. In a similar manner, extraneous cognitive load, imposed by the 
instructional design used, must also be allocated working memory resources. 
Working memory resources devoted to information that is imposed solely by the 
Chapter 5
Intrinsic and Extraneous Cognitive Load

58
5 Intrinsic and Extraneous Cognitive Load
instructional design can be referred to as ‘extraneous resources’ that must deal with 
extraneous cognitive load.
Additivity of Intrinsic and Extraneous Cognitive Load
Intrinsic and extraneous cognitive load are additive. Together, they determine the 
total cognitive load imposed by material that needs to be learned. That total cogni-
tive load determines the required working memory resources needed to process 
the information with some resources dealing with intrinsic cognitive load 
(germane resources) and other resources dealing with extraneous cognitive load 
(extraneous resources). While resources are devoted to dealing with either intrinsic 
or extraneous cognitive load those resources come from the same undifferentiated 
working memory pool.
If the working memory resources required to deal with the load imposed by 
intrinsic and extraneous cognitive load exceed the available resources of working 
memory, the cognitive system will fail, at least in part, to process necessary infor-
mation. Germane resources will be too low to deal with the intrinsic cognitive load 
imposed by the learning materials. Indeed, if the instructional design is particularly 
poor resulting in a very high extraneous cognitive load, there may be insufficient 
resources to even move beyond the barrier of the poor instructional design and 
begin to devote germane resources to intrinsic cognitive load. Learners may not 
even commence learning because the entire pool of working memory resources is 
needed to deal with the instructional processes used.
One aim of instructional design is to reduce extraneous cognitive load so that a 
greater percentage of the pool of working memory resources can be devoted to 
issues germane to learning rather than to issues extraneous to learning. Extraneous 
cognitive load should be reduced as far as possible, thus reducing working mem­
ory resources devoted to extraneous issues and increasing the availability of germane 
resources devoted to intrinsic cognitive load.
Element Interactivity
Levels of both intrinsic and extraneous cognitive load are determined by element 
interactivity. Interacting elements are defined as elements that must be processed 
simultaneously in working memory because they are logically related. An element 
is anything that needs to be learned or processed, or has been learned or processed. 
Elements are characteristically schemas. Most schemas consist of sub-schemas or 
sub-elements. Prior to a schema being acquired, those sub-elements must be treated 
as individual elements in working memory. After they have been incorporated into 
a schema, that schema can be treated as a single element in working memory. Thus, 
learning reduces working memory load by converting multiple lower-level schemas 

59
Element Interactivity and Intrinsic Cognitive Load
into a smaller number of higher-level schemas or even a single higher-level schema 
that can be treated as a single entity.
With respect to intrinsic cognitive load, some material can be learned one ele-
ment at a time and so is low in element interactivity and low in intrinsic cognitive 
load. Such material requires few working memory resources. Other material has 
elements that cannot be learned in isolation. The elements interact and so they must 
be processed simultaneously rather than as single, unrelated elements because they 
cannot be understood as single elements. Such material is high in element interac-
tivity and high in intrinsic cognitive load. High element interactivity material 
requires more working memory resources than material that is low in element inter-
activity until the interacting elements have been incorporated into a schema after 
learning.
Extraneous cognitive load also is determined by levels of element interactivity 
but, in this case, element interactivity that is unnecessary for achieving learning 
goals. Some instructional procedures require learners to process only a limited 
number of such elements simultaneously. In this case, element interactivity is low 
and extraneous cognitive load is low. Different instructional designs require 
learners to process a large number of elements simultaneously resulting in high ele-
ment interactivity and a high extraneous cognitive load. The manner in which 
­element interactivity influences intrinsic and extraneous cognitive load will be 
discussed next.
Element Interactivity and Intrinsic Cognitive Load
As indicated above, this source of cognitive load is intrinsic to the information that 
the learner must deal with (Sweller, 1994) and is entirely determined by levels of 
element interactivity. Element interactivity can be estimated for any information 
that students may be required to learn. We will begin with examples of low element 
interactivity information.
Acquiring a new vocabulary is a common necessity in many disciplines. Learning 
the new vocabulary of a second language provides an obvious example but acquir-
ing a new vocabulary, to a greater or lesser extent, is likely to be a requirement of 
all areas. In chemistry for example, the symbols of each of the elements of the 
periodic table must be learned. For many vocabulary items of a discipline, each of 
the elements can be learned in isolation with no consequences for, and no relation 
to, any of the other elements that must be learned. For example, a chemistry student 
can learn that the symbol for copper is Cu quite independently of learning that the 
symbol for iron is Fe. Similarly, a second language student can learn that the 
translation of the English word ‘cat’ is the French word ‘chat’, independently of 
learning that the translation of the English word ‘dog’ is the French word ‘chien’. 
In each case there are no logical or structural reasons why learning one relation 
should have any impact on learning other relations. As a consequence, these catego-
ries of relations do not need to be learned simultaneously. They can be learned 

60
5 Intrinsic and Extraneous Cognitive Load
independently at different times and without reference to each other because the 
learning elements do not interact. Learning these relations provides an example of 
low element interactivity material.
High element interactivity information consists of elements that are closely 
related to each other and so cannot be learned in isolation. The elements interact in 
a manner that renders learning individual elements in isolation meaningless. All 
relevant elements must be processed simultaneously in order to be learned in a 
meaningful fashion. For example, while we can learn chemical symbols in isola-
tion, we cannot learn in isolation the various ways those symbols are manipulated 
in a chemical equation such as MgCO3 + H2SO4 → CO2 + MgSO4 + H2O. We need 
to consider the entire equation, including all of the elements that constitute the 
equation, whenever any manipulation occurs.
Indeed, equations in general, by their very nature are high in element interactiv-
ity. We can see the effect of high element interactivity by considering simple algebra 
equations. Assume someone is learning to solve equations of the form, (a + b) /c = d, 
solve for a. This equation includes a large number of interacting elements. 
The symbols of the equation such as a, b, =, /, etc. provide obvious elements but 
there are many more elements than the symbols. All of the relations between all of 
the symbols also constitute elements that must be processed when learning to solve 
equations. As an example, the symbol ‘/ ’ and the symbol, ‘c’, have a particular 
relation that must be processed and understood in order to learn how to solve this 
problem. The relation between ‘/’ and ‘c’ constitutes an element that must be 
learned. Furthermore, that element itself interacts with all of the other elements in 
the problem whether those elements consist of symbols or other relations between 
symbols. The number of interacting elements incorporated in the problem (a + b) /c = d, 
solve for a is large and because they interact all elements must at some point be 
considered simultaneously. Learning to solve algebra equations is a high ele-
ment interactivity task because there are many elements that must be processed 
simultaneously.
A full understanding of high element interactivity material cannot occur without 
simultaneously processing all of the elements that constitute the task. We cannot, 
for example, process the ‘/ ’ symbol in the previous equation, in isolation, without 
reference to the other symbols and relations between the symbols. We need all of 
the other symbols and relations to confer meaning on the ‘/’ symbol. The equation 
only can be fully understood by processing all of the relevant symbols and relations 
simultaneously. Furthermore, to solve the problem, the symbols and relations must 
be related to the entire problem statement and its possible solution. Unless all of the 
interacting elements are processed simultaneously, high element interactivity mate-
rial cannot be understood because considering individual elements in isolation tells 
us little of relevance to the problem and its solution.
The level of interactivity between elements of information that are essential for 
learning determines intrinsic cognitive load. If element interactivity is low, intrinsic 
cognitive load also will be low because only a small number of elements and rela-
tions will need to be processed simultaneously in working memory. At the extreme, 
individual elements can be learned independently of all other element and no 

61
Element Interactivity and Intrinsic Cognitive Load
­element imposes a high working memory load resulting in a very low intrinsic 
cognitive load. In contrast, if the level of interactivity between essential elements is 
high, intrinsic cognitive load will also be high.
Task Difficulty
A low intrinsic cognitive load needs to be distinguished from levels of task diffi-
culty. A task may have a very low intrinsic cognitive load imposing a very low load 
on working memory but still be very difficult. Learning the vocabulary of a second 
language provides a clear example. Natural languages have a great number of 
vocabulary items that need to be learned. Learning those vocabulary items can be a 
difficult, time-consuming task that frequently takes many years. The difficulty of 
the task is driven by the large number of items, not the complexity of the items. 
Each vocabulary item may be acquired with little working memory load if it is low 
in element interactivity and so imposes a low intrinsic cognitive load. Difficulty in 
learning some material such as second language vocabulary items derives from the 
many individual elements that need to be learned, and not from any difficulty asso-
ciated with each element.
While a low element interactivity task is only difficult if there are many elements 
that must be processed sequentially as in the case of acquiring the vocabulary of a 
second language, a high element interactivity task may be difficult even if the num-
ber of relevant elements is relatively low. But the reason for task difficulty when 
dealing with high element interactivity material such as the algebra equation pre-
sented above is usually very different to the reason low element interactivity mate-
rial may be difficult. A small number of elements, if they interact, can be very 
difficult to process in a capacity constrained working memory. A large number of 
interacting elements can be impossibly difficult for some people. The difficulty of 
learning novel, high interactivity material can derive from two unrelated sources. 
High interactivity material always is difficult because of element interactivity. It 
also may include a large number of elements, although the total number of elements 
does not contribute directly to element interactivity. Thus, some high element inter-
activity material can be difficult to learn not only because it may consist of a large 
number of interacting elements but also because it consists of many elements in 
absolute terms. Material that includes both a very large number of elements with 
many of those elements interacting will be exceptionally difficult to learn.
The total number of elements and the extent to which they interact can vary 
independently and so the total number of elements has no relation to the intrinsic 
cognitive load unless the elements interact. Learners may need to assimilate liter-
ally thousands of elements but face a relatively insignificant intrinsic cognitive 
load if low element interactivity allows individual elements to be processed inde-
pendently of each other. The task of assimilating many elements is in itself diffi-
cult even if they do not interact, but processing any individual element is not 
difficult. In contrast, a relatively small number of interacting elements can impose 

62
5 Intrinsic and Extraneous Cognitive Load
an ­overwhelming intrinsic cognitive load because in order for the information to 
be understood, all elements need to be processed simultaneously and simultane-
ously processing several elements may exceed working memory limits. The resul-
tant, excessive intrinsic cognitive load requires particular instructional strategies. 
Those strategies will be discussed in Part IV.
Understanding
Element interactivity can be used to define ‘understanding’ (Marcus, Cooper, & 
Sweller, 1996). Information is fully understood when all of its interacting elements 
can be processed in working memory. A failure to understand occurs when appro-
priate elements are not processed in working memory. Information is difficult to 
understand when it consists of more interacting elements than can readily be pro-
cessed in working memory. Low element interactivity information is easy to under-
stand because it can easily and appropriately be processed in working memory.
The relation between element interactivity and understanding can be seen 
clearly when we consider the language we use when dealing with low element 
interactivity information. Low element interactivity material does not have the term 
‘understanding’ attached to it. Assume someone cannot tell us that Cu is the chemi-
cal symbol for copper. We assume that they either have not learned the symbol or 
have forgotten it and we will refer to their failure as a lack of knowledge or a failure 
of memory. It would be seen as peculiar to refer to the failure in the context of 
understanding. If someone cannot tell us that the chemical symbol for copper is Cu, 
we are unlikely to attribute the failure to a lack of understanding. The term is inap-
propriate in this context.
The contrast is marked when we deal with high element interactivity informa-
tion. The term ‘understanding’ only applies to high element interactivity material 
associated with a high intrinsic cognitive load. It is never used when dealing with 
low element interactivity material that imposes a low intrinsic cognitive load. 
Consider a student who has failed to solve the problem (a + b) /c = d, solve for a. 
Similar to materials with low element interactivity, that failure is due to a lack of 
knowledge or a failure of memory. The student has never learned to solve this cat-
egory of problems or has forgotten how to solve them but in this case, most people 
are likely to assume that a failure of understanding has occurred. Information is 
‘understood’ when we are able to process multiple, interacting elements simultane-
ously in working memory. We fail to understand information when the number of 
multiple, interacting elements is too large to permit us to process all of the elements 
in working memory. In the case of the above algebra example, students may be 
unable to understand how to solve this problem if they are unable to process all of 
the pro-numerals, symbols and relations between them in working memory.
The distinction between learning with understanding and learning by rote can be 
explained by element interactivity. Learning by rote tends to have strong negative con-
notations while learning with understanding has equally strong positive ­connotations. 

63
Element Interactivity and Intrinsic Cognitive Load
Both forms of learning can be explained by processes of element interactivity in 
working memory. While learning with understanding is reserved for high element inter-
activity information, learning by rote can be applied to either low or high element 
interactivity information. When dealing with low element interactivity information, we 
assume, correctly, that learning by rote is unavoidable because no other form of learn-
ing is available. If learning chemistry, we have no choice but to rote learn that the 
symbol Cu stands for copper. In contrast, high element interactivity material can be 
either rote learned or learned with understanding and so the differential connotations 
associated with learning by rote or learning with understanding apply. However, we 
need to understand the solution to the problem (a + b) / = c, solve for a to enable us to 
create more complex schemas in this domain. We should not rote learn the solution.
The distinction between learning by rote and learning with understanding in ele-
ment interactivity terms will be exemplified by considering a child learning the con-
cept of multiplication. Multiplication can be learned in the same way as a new 
vocabulary with each multiplicative value stored in long-term memory. A child can 
rote learn that 3 × 4 = 12. There are several advantages to rote learning with a major 
one being an immense reduction in element interactivity and a commensurate reduc-
tion in working memory load. Rote learning that 3 × 4 = 12 is likely to require no more 
than five elements consisting of the five symbols that constitute the expression.
Understanding why 3 × 4 = 12 also requires knowing the outcome of the pro-
cedure but, in addition, it requires processing much more information in working 
memory and storing that information in long-term memory, resulting in a consid-
erable increase in element interactivity. Rather than merely learning that 3 × 4 = 12, 
learners need to understand that the reason the answer to the multiplication is 12 
is because 4 is added 3 times. Not only does 3 × 4 = 12, but 4 + 4 + 4 = 12 and 
the fact that both arithmetic operations give an answer of 12 is not a coincidence. 
The multiplication equation means adding 3 lots of 4. To begin to understand the 
multiplication equation as opposed to merely rote learning it, the elements asso­
ciated with 4 + 4 + 4 = 12 must be added to, and interact with, the elements 
associated with 3 × 4 = 12. Element interactivity and its associated cognitive load 
must be substantially increased. Additional understanding along with additional 
element interactivity and working memory load occur when students learn that 
3 × 4 = 4 + 4 + 4 = 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 4 × 3 = 12. Learning relations between addition, 
subtraction, multiplication and division results in further understanding, further 
element interactivity and further working memory load. Many learners cease 
adding additional interacting elements beyond 3 × 4 =12 because of the dramatic 
increase in element interactivity and cognitive load that is required when learning 
with understanding. This failure to go beyond the basic knowledge (3 × 4 =12) 
means that learners will not at this point learn the commutative law of multiplica-
tion (a . b = b . a) and how the commutative law might be applied to other numbers 
(e.g. 2 × 5 = 5 × 2). Hence schema formation is limited by not learning further 
relations and connections within the multiplication system.
Based on this analysis, learning by rote and learning with understanding require 
the same qualitative processes. In both cases, information must be processed in 
working memory prior to being stored in long-term memory. The differences are 

64
5 Intrinsic and Extraneous Cognitive Load
quantitative, not qualitative. Learning with understanding always increases the 
number of interacting elements that must be processed in working memory. For all 
of us, under at least some circumstances, the increase in element interactivity and 
working memory load associated with understanding information may be too large 
to handle. Learning by rote without understanding may be the only viable option. 
Learning with understanding should always be the goal of instruction, but as 
instructors we need to understand that sometimes that goal will not be achievable. 
Rote learning may be the only available option, at least in the initial stages of 
learning.
From an instructional perspective, we can see that under some circumstances, it 
may not be possible for very high element interactivity material to be simultane-
ously processed in working memory because working memory limits may be 
exceeded. Such information cannot be understood, at least initially. An initial fail-
ure to understand does not mean the information cannot be processed. Processing 
can occur, individual element by individual element or by small groups of elements. 
We label such processing conditions as learning by rote. Rote learning may be 
unavoidable during the initial stages of learning very high element interactivity 
material (Pollock, Chandler, & Sweller, 2002). This issue will be explored further, 
in conjunction with empirical evidence, when discussing the isolated–interacting 
elements effect in Chapter 16.
Altering Intrinsic Cognitive Load
In one sense, intrinsic cognitive load cannot be altered because it is intrinsic to a 
particular task. If the learning task is unaltered and if the knowledge levels of the 
learners remain constant, intrinsic cognitive load also will remain constant. That 
constant or fixed cognitive load can be altered by changing the nature of the learn-
ing task. For example, it was pointed out above, that if interacting elements are 
taught as though they are isolated with each element treated as though it bears no 
relation to other elements, element interactivity and intrinsic cognitive load can be 
reduced. Of course, the reduction in intrinsic cognitive load only has been accom-
plished by changing the task. Learners no longer are taught the relations between 
interacting elements, a major component of intrinsic cognitive load. That may not 
matter during early learning, but for most subject matter full understanding includ-
ing the relations between interacting elements is likely to be essential at some point. 
Reducing intrinsic cognitive load by altering the nature of what is learned may be 
an important instructional technique, but in most cases its utility is likely to be 
temporary.
Intrinsic cognitive load also will be reduced by the act of learning itself. 
Learning includes converting a group of interacting elements that are treated as 
multiple elements in working memory into a smaller number or even a single ele-
ment. Almost any instance of learning provides an example. To people not familiar 
with the Latin alphabet and English, ‘CAT’ is likely to provide a complex set of 

65
Element Interactivity and Intrinsic Cognitive Load
squiggles that overwhelm working memory. To readers of this text, of course, with 
schemas for ‘CAT’, the interacting elements are buried in the schema and the intrin-
sic cognitive load is negligible. A major function of learning is to dramatically 
reduce element interactivity and intrinsic cognitive load by incorporating interact-
ing elements in schemas. The resultant reduction in cognitive load frees working 
memory resources for other activities. In the present case of reading this text, 
because working memory resources are not devoted to decoding the text, they can 
be used to interpret the content, the ultimate aim of learning to read. Thus, learning 
through schema acquisition eliminates the working memory load imposed by high 
element interactivity information.
Apart from altering what is learned or the act of learning itself, intrinsic cogni-
tive load cannot be altered. For a particular task presented to learners with a particu-
lar level of knowledge, intrinsic cognitive load is fixed.
It can be seen that the concept of element interactivity is closely tied to the over-
lapping definitions of elements and schemas. An element is anything that needs to 
be learned or processed while schemas are usually multiple, interacting elements. 
Schema construction consists of learning how multiple elements interact while 
schema automation allows those interacting elements to be ignored when using a 
schema. Once a schema has been constructed, it becomes another, single, element 
that does not impose a heavy working memory load and can be used to construct 
higher-order schemas. The interacting elements are embedded in a schema that can 
be treated as a single element in the construction of more complex schemas. While 
a written word consists of a complex set of interacting lines and curves that some-
one unfamiliar with the written English language may have difficulty interpreting 
or even reproducing, to a fluent reader those interacting elements are embedded in 
a schema that itself acts a single element.
Relations of Intrinsic Cognitive Load to Human  
Cognitive Architecture
Novel, unfamiliar information that needs to be learned is governed by the borrowing 
and reorganising, randomness as genesis and narrow limits of change principles. 
These principles describe how novel information is acquired. Once learned, infor-
mation that needs to be used is governed by the information store and the environ-
mental organising and linking principles. These principles describe how familiar, 
stored information is used to govern activity.
Learned, familiar information is treated quite differently from novel, yet-to-be-
learned information. As indicated when discussing the narrow limits of change and 
the environmental organising and linking principles, the characteristics of working 
memory are very different when dealing with unfamiliar and familiar information. 
Those differences now can be considered from the perspective of the manner in 
which high element interactivity information is handled. Novel, high element 
­interactivity information that is yet to be learned is likely to impose a high intrinsic 

66
5 Intrinsic and Extraneous Cognitive Load
cognitive load that may overwhelm working memory when it is being acquired via 
the borrowing and reorganising or randomness as genesis principles. That same 
information, once learned and stored in long-term memory as a schema with its 
interacting elements incorporated in the schema, can be retrieved from the informa-
tion store using the environmental organising and linking principle. In contrast to 
the difficulty in processing the elements of that information when a schema is being 
constructed, once it has been constructed and stored in long-term memory, it can be 
retrieved as a single rather than multiple elements from long-term memory to gov-
ern activity. The multiple, interacting elements are embedded within a schema and 
it is that schema that is retrieved from long-term memory. Processing a single 
schema as a single element is likely to impose a minimal working memory load.
Element Interactivity and Extraneous Cognitive Load
Element interactivity is associated with extraneous as well as intrinsic cognitive 
load. Unlike intrinsic cognitive load that is imposed by the intrinsic nature of the 
information that learners must acquire, extraneous cognitive load is imposed on 
working memory due to the manner in which information is presented during 
instruction. Some instructional procedures require learners to process a large num-
ber of interacting elements many of which are not directly relevant to learning 
through schema acquisition. Other procedures, in presenting the same information 
for learners to acquire, substantially reduce this element interactivity. While 
detailed information concerning element interactivity associated with extraneous 
cognitive load will be presented in the chapters of Part IV, preliminary information 
will be presented in this section.
It may be recalled that based on the borrowing and reorganising principle, the 
acquisition of biologically secondary information is assisted by direct, explicit 
instruction. (We have evolved to acquire biologically primary knowledge without 
explicit instruction.) Let us assume that instead of direct, explicit instruction, prob-
lem solving is used as an instructional tool. Learners must acquire knowledge by 
discovering solutions to problems that they have been presented. Students might, 
for example, be learning mathematics by the common technique of solving prob-
lems. Solving novel problems for which a solution is not available in long-term 
memory requires the use of a means–ends strategy. As indicated in Chapters 7 and 8 
on the goal-free and worked example effects, that strategy requires problem solvers 
to simultaneously consider the current problem state (e.g. a + b = c), the goal state 
(make a the subject of the equation), to extract differences between the current state 
and the goal state (the term ‘+b’ is located on the left-hand side of the equation and 
needs to be eliminated) and to find problem-solving operators (rules of algebra) that 
can be used to eliminate the differences between the current state and the goal state 
(subtract b from both sides of the equation). The problem cannot be solved unless all of 
these elements are considered. Element interactivity is very high when using a means–
ends strategy because the strategy necessarily involves processing several elements. 

67
Instructional Implications
Furthermore, those elements cannot be considered in isolation. We cannot extract 
differences between a given problem state and a goal state without simultaneously 
considering the given state, the goal state, the differences between them and the 
problem-solving moves that might reduce those differences.
There are alternatives to using a high element interactivity means–ends strategy. 
Rather than having learners solve problems, they could be presented with worked 
examples that completely eliminate a means–ends strategy because learners are no 
longer engaged in problem solving. Whether learners engage in problem solving or 
in studying worked examples is under the control of instructors and so the high 
element interactivity associated with means–ends problem solving is an example of 
extraneous cognitive load that can and should be reduced. The consequences of 
using problem solving rather than worked examples will be discussed in detail in 
Chapter 8. There are many other examples of element interactivity resulting in a 
high extraneous cognitive load that will be discussed in the chapters of Part IV.
This argument is closely tied to the structures of human cognitive architecture. 
If instruction requires learners to engage in problem-solving search via the random-
ness as genesis principle, or if it includes other cognitive activities that are similarly 
unfavourable to schema acquisition and automation, then the effectiveness of that 
instruction will be reduced due to working memory limitations associated with the 
narrow limits of change principle. Problem-solving search along with a variety of 
other cognitive activities associated with some instructional procedures imposes a 
heavy extraneous cognitive load that can interfere with learning.
While it is never advantageous to increase extraneous cognitive load, it can be 
advantageous to increase intrinsic cognitive load. Increasing intrinsic cognitive load 
increases the amount of information that needs to be processed and learned, and 
providing working memory capacity is available that increase is likely to be benefi-
cial (see the variability effect in Chapter 16). In contrast, an increase in extraneous 
cognitive load results in learners using scarce working memory resources for pur-
poses other than learning. Since extraneous cognitive load normally is under the 
control of the instructor, it can be reduced by altering instructional procedures and 
without compromising understanding. Understanding is likely to be increased if a 
reduction in extraneous cognitive load frees working memory resources for schema 
acquisition and automation.
Instructional Implications
Total cognitive load, consisting of intrinsic and extraneous cognitive load, must not 
exceed working memory resources. If total cognitive load is too high, processing 
necessary information may become difficult and so learning may cease. For given 
learners and given information, intrinsic cognitive load cannot be altered. It can be 
increased or decreased by changing the nature of what is learned. If the intrinsic 
cognitive load is high, the level of extraneous cognitive load can become critical. 
Reducing extraneous load is much more important when intrinsic cognitive load is 

68
5 Intrinsic and Extraneous Cognitive Load
high than when it is low. A high extraneous cognitive load may not matter a great 
deal if intrinsic cognitive load is low because the total cognitive load may be less 
than available working memory resources. In other words, for material with a low 
element interactivity and therefore low intrinsic cognitive load, learners neverthe-
less will be able to process the information. A less than optimal instructional design 
associated with low intrinsic cognitive load due to low element interactivity may 
therefore not interfere with learning. The total cognitive load still may be within 
working memory limits.
If intrinsic cognitive load is high, adding a high extraneous cognitive load to 
an already high intrinsic cognitive load may well result in an excessive total 
load. Under high intrinsic cognitive load conditions, instructional design issues 
may be important, unlike low intrinsic cognitive load conditions. Adding the high 
element interactivity associated with a high intrinsic cognitive load to the high element 
interactivity associated with a high extraneous cognitive load may exceed avail-
able working memory resources. Devoting working memory resources to deal-
ing with an inappropriate instructional design may not matter when intrinsic 
cognitive load is low. It may be critical when intrinsic cognitive load is high (see 
Chapter 15 on the element interactivity effect). As a consequence, most of the 
cognitive load effects discussed in the chapters of Part IV are concerned with 
conditions under which both intrinsic and extraneous cognitive load are high and 
so need to be reduced. Cognitive load theory has been concerned primarily, 
though not exclusively, with reducing extraneous cognitive load.
Conclusions
Cognitive load imposed by instructional materials can be divided into intrinsic and 
extraneous cognitive load. Equivalently, working memory resources can be divided 
into germane resources that deal with intrinsic cognitive load and extraneous 
resources that deal with extraneous cognitive load. This division has proved to be 
basic to the development of cognitive load theory. The primary, though not sole, 
aim of cognitive load theory has been to devise instructional procedures that reduce 
extraneous cognitive load and so decrease the working memory resources that must 
be devoted to information that is extraneous to learning. Working memory resources 
that no longer need to be devoted to dealing with extraneous cognitive load can 
instead be diverted to dealing with intrinsic cognitive load that is germane to the 
learning process.
Most of the cognitive load effects discussed in Part IV of this book are con-
cerned with instructional procedures that reduce extraneous cognitive load. When 
dealing with extraneous cognitive load, it is always advantageous to reduce it and 
never advantageous to increase it. A smaller number of the cognitive load effects 
are concerned with altering intrinsic cognitive load rather than reducing extraneous 
cognitive load. It can be advantageous to increase or decrease intrinsic cognitive 
load depending on whether intrinsic cognitive load exceeds available working

Conclusions
memory resources or under-utilises those resources. The cognitive load effects 
discussed in Part IV were all based on the assumption that extraneous cognitive 
load should be reduced while intrinsic cognitive load should be optimised. In order 
to describe ideal levels of cognitive load, we first need to discuss techniques for 
measuring cognitive load. The next chapter is concerned with this issue.

Because of the centrality of working memory load to cognitive load theory, measuring 
this load has been a high priority for researchers. While it is possible to demonstrate 
support for the validity of the theory by predicting experimental outcomes, it is 
useful to additionally provide independent measures of cognitive load. In this chapter 
we describe the various methods used to measure cognitive load and how they have 
developed over the last 30 years.
Indirect Measures of Cognitive Load
In the early days of cognitive load theory, cognitive load was not directly measured. 
It was assumed based on the results of experiments examining the relation between 
problem solving and learning. Several techniques were used to indirectly assess 
cognitive load.
Computational Models
The initial research into cognitive load theory focused on the inefficiency of problem 
solving as a learning strategy. It was hypothesised that high problem-solving search 
led to a greater working memory load than low problem-solving search. In a series of 
experiments conducted by Sweller and colleagues in the 1980s, it was demonstrated 
that a learning strategy that required considerable problem-solving search led to infe-
rior learning outcomes than a strategy that employed far less problem-solving search. 
To explain these results, Sweller (1988) argued that schema acquisition was impeded 
because using some problem-solving heuristics led to unnecessary problem-solving 
search that imposed a high extraneous cognitive load. In contrast, procedures that 
reduced problem-solving search were assumed to reduce cognitive load.
Theoretical support demonstrating that problem-solving search did increase 
cognitive load was indicated by computational models. Using production system

models to compare a high with a low search strategy, Sweller (1988) found that 
higher search required a more complex model to simulate the problem-solving 
process, corresponding to more information being held and processed in working 
memory. Similarly, Ayres and Sweller (1990) using a production system model to 
simulate the problem-solving solution of multi-step geometry problems provided 
evidence that a high search strategy required more working memory resources than 
a simpler strategy.
The indirect evidence provided by computational models has restricted their use 
as an indicator of cognitive load. Nevertheless, within a cognitive load theory 
framework, computational models were the first attempt to provide a degree of 
independent evidence that cognitive load was an important factor in instructional 
design. They were an important factor in the origins of cognitive load theory.
Performance During Acquisition
During this early period of cognitive load theory, performance indicators during 
the acquisition or learning phase were also used to support a cognitive load expla-
nation of the observed effects. Without a direct measure, Chandler and Sweller 
(1991, 1992) argued that instructional time could be used as a proxy for cognitive 
load. It was theorised that if students were required to learn a topic using a strategy 
that raised cognitive load, then this increase in cognitive load would impact on 
performance during the learning phase. Not only would future performance be 
affected as indicated through test scores, but also performance during acquisition. 
Early studies supported this argument (see Owen & Sweller, 1985; Sweller, 
Chandler, Tierney, & Cooper, 1990; Sweller and Cooper, 1985). Evidence was 
also found that error rates were higher during acquisition under conditions of 
expected high cognitive load (see Owen & Sweller, 1985; Sweller & Cooper, 
1985). Increased cognitive load may impact negatively on both learning time and 
acquisition task accuracy.
Error Profiles Between Problems
Error rates also have been used to identify differences in cognitive load within 
problems. Ayres and Sweller (1990) showed that students often make errors at par-
ticular points when problem solving in a geometry domain due to the high working 
memory load at those points. In a later study, Ayres (2001) demonstrated that error 
rates varied on mathematical tasks that required sequential calculations. High error 
rates corresponded to locations where decision making was at its greatest intensity 
with many variables needing to be considered. Although these two studies investi-
gated problem solving and not instructional procedures, they provided additional 
evidence that error rates could be used to determine working memory demands.

73
Subjective Measures of Cognitive Load
Subjective Measures of Cognitive Load
Initially, theoretical considerations of cognitive load were used to predict instructional 
effectiveness, supported mainly by indirect measures of cognitive load, such as 
error rates and learning times, indicated above. As cognitive load theory developed 
and more instructional effects were identified, the need for more direct measures of 
cognitive load became apparent. For example, Chandler and Sweller (1991) and 
Sweller and Chandler (1994) commented on the absence of a direct measure of 
cognitive load. The impasse was broken by Paas (1992) who provided a major 
breakthrough by developing a subjective measure of cognitive load.
A Subjective Measure of Mental Effort
Based on a previous instrument developed by Bratfisch, Borg, and Dornic (1972), 
Paas (1992) reasoned that learners are able to introspect the amount of mental effort 
invested during learning and testing and this ‘intensity of effort’ may be considered 
to be an ‘index’ of cognitive load (p. 429). Paas, Tuovinen, Tabbers, and van 
Gerven (2003) later refined the definition of mental effort as ‘the aspect of cogni-
tive load that refers to the cognitive capacity that is actually allocated to accom-
modate the demands imposed by the task: thus, it can be considered to reflect the 
actual cognitive load’ (p. 64).
Using a 9-point Likert scale ranging from very, very low mental effort (1) to 
very, very high mental effort (9), learners were asked to rate their mental effort at 
various points in the learning and testing cycle. In comparing instructional proce-
dures that were hypothesised to raise or lower cognitive load, Paas (1992) found a 
match between self-rated mental effort and test performance. Learners who were 
presented an instructional design hypothesised to impose a low cognitive load had 
superior learning outcomes and rated their mental effort lower than students who 
were presented a design hypothesised to be high in cognitive load.
A follow-up study by Paas and van Merriënboer (1994) replicated the findings 
of Paas (1992). Furthermore, Paas and van Merriënboer (1994) also collected 
physiological measures through spectral analysis of heart rate. However, in contrast 
to the self-rating scale, the physiological measures were unable to detect differ-
ences between treatment groups and could only differentiate between mentally 
inactive and active periods. Subjective ratings were found to be more sensitive and 
far less intrusive than the physiological measure. The 9-point scale was also found 
to be highly reliable (see Paas, van Merriënboer, & Adam, 1994).
A Subjective Measure of Difficulty
The success of these early trials of subjective measures led others to adopt the sub-
jective scale as a measure of cognitive load. However, many researchers, instead of 

74
6 Measuring Cognitive Load
using the term mental effort, asked learners to rate how difficult or easy they found 
the learning task. For example, in a series of experiments, Marcus, Cooper, and 
Sweller (1996) demonstrated that subjective measures of difficulty varied signifi-
cantly according to the level of element interactivity of a task. In addition, Ayres 
(2006a) found that subjective measures of difficulty could detect variations in ele-
ment interactivity within tasks.
The simple subjective rating scale, regardless of the wording used (mental effort 
or difficulty), has, perhaps surprisingly, been shown to be the most sensitive mea-
sure available to differentiate the cognitive load imposed by different instructional 
procedures. It has been used extensively to determine the relative cognitive load 
imposed by the various instructional procedures discussed in Part IV. Paas et al. 
(2003b) documented over 25 studies that used a subjective measure of cognitive 
load between 1992 and 2002. There have been many more since.
Variations in Subjective Ratings
Van Gog and Paas (2008) indicated that mental effort and difficulty may be distinct 
constructs with ensuing consequences. Some preliminary research investigating 
differences between the two scales supports this view (Ayres & Youssef, 2008). 
Asking a student how difficult he or she found a task differs from asking how much 
effort was invested in completing the task. Although the two measures are often 
correlated, difficulty does not always match effort. For example, very difficult prob-
lems may be so demanding for some learners that they are unable to make any 
realistic effort.
As well as potential differences in what is measured, van Gog and Paas (2008) 
also identified the time when mental ratings are collected as a further variation. 
Paas and van Merriënboer (1994) used mental effort measures collected after learn-
ers had solved test problems. In contrast, many other researchers have collected the 
data after the acquisition (instructional) period has been completed. The two strate-
gies will not necessarily be comparable and may yield different results. Some of 
those differences will be considered below when discussing efficiency measures.
Consistency of the Subjective Measures
Despite these differing procedures, subjective measures of difficulty or mental effort 
have been surprisingly consistent in matching performance data predicted by cogni-
tive load theory (see also Moreno, 2004; van Merriënboer, Schuurman, De Croock, 
& Paas, 2002) with few discrepancies or contradictions. However, in some studies, 
no statistically significant differences were found between subjective measures in 
spite of group treatment differences on performance tests (see Cuevas, Fiore, & Oser, 
2002; Hummel, Paas, & Koper, 2004; Kester, Kirschner, & van Merriënboer, 2005). 

75
Efficiency Measures
There have also been studies where there is a cognitive load difference based on 
subjective measures but no group treatment effect on performance tests (Homer, 
Plass, & Blake, 2008; Van Gerven, Paas, van Merriënboer, Hendriks, & Schmidt, 
2003). In Kalyuga, Chandler, and Sweller (2004), each of three experiments pro-
duced a different result: a cognitive load difference with no test effect; a cognitive 
load difference and a corresponding test effect; no cognitive load difference but a test 
effect. It is feasible, that under some specific conditions and materials, the expected 
match will not occur. Of course, when considering any statistically determined 
effect, there inevitably will be failures to match. The correlation between subjective 
rating scales and test performance cannot be perfect. Notwithstanding that occa-
sional inconsistency, subjective measures have had a profound influence and pro-
vided a useful tool in providing evidence in support of cognitive load theory.
Efficiency Measures
Building on the Paas (1992) self-rating scale, Paas and van Merriënboer (1993) 
developed an efficiency measure, which combined mental effort with task perfor-
mance indicators. Paas and van Merriënboer reasoned that it was important to 
consider the cognitive costs of learning. Even though two different instructional 
methods might produce the same learning outcomes, the effort that went into 
achieving these levels of performance was an important consideration. If one 
instructional strategy produces the same performance as another strategy but with 
fewer cognitive resources expended, then that first strategy is more efficient. 
Efficiency (E) was calculated using the following formula:
(
)
Ptest
Etest
Z
2
/
E =
−
√
Z
where ZPtest represents the standardised (Z scores) test scores, and ZEtest the stan-
dardised mental effort scores collected after the testing period. The formula is based 
on the mathematical calculation of the perpendicular distance from a point to a line 
(in this case y = x). Differences in efficiency can be depicted by a simple graphic 
representation (see Fig. 6.1). When Z-scores for performance and mental effort are 
equal, the value of E is zero, depicted in Fig. 6.1 by the diagonal line (y = x). All 
points on this line equate to E = 0, whereas points above the line (E > 0) represent 
efficient learning and points below the line (E < 0) inefficient learning. Paas et al. 
(2003b) further explained that high-instructional efficiency results from high task 
performance and low mental effort (zone H in the diagram), whereas low-instructional 
efficiency results from low task performance and high mental effort (zone L in the 
diagram).
In a review of the efficiency measure, van Gog and Paas (2008) documented that 
in the period 1993–2007, over 30 cognitive load theory–related studies used an 
efficiency measure. However, as indicated above, van Gog and Paas (2008) also 
pointed out that there have been variations in the way in which mental ratings have 

76
6 Measuring Cognitive Load
been collected and those variations affect the efficiency measure because mental 
ratings are integral to the formula for efficiency. Van Gog and Paas argued that 
these different approaches measure different types of efficiencies. Using mental 
effort ratings collected after test performance, measures the learning consequences 
of acquiring cognitive structures such as schemas, whereas using the post-acquisition 
measures, indicates training efficiency.
We agree that learning efficiency may be a good indicator of schema acquisition 
and automation. If learners have acquired new schemas and can use them with less 
effort, then schema acquisition can be considered robust, even if the instructional 
method was more demanding. Nevertheless, instructional efficiency has an impor-
tant role as it shows how efficient the learning process was, a key consideration of 
the cognitive load effects discussed in Part IV. Knowing how difficult or easy it was 
to follow an instructional design is critical to cognitive load theory. Despite these 
differences in approaches, both calculating the efficiency of training and the effi-
ciency in using learned information in a test are important and can provide vital 
information relevant to instructional design.

Measuring Cognitive Load Through a Secondary Task
Issues with Calculating Efficiency
Despite its wide-scale use, Hoffman and Schraw (2010) have identified some concerns 
associated with the calculation of instructional efficiency. In a review of efficiency, 
Hoffman and Schraw categorised Paas and van Merriënboer’s original model as a 
deviation model, because it is based on the difference (discrepancy) between stan-
dardised scores of performance and effort. They argued that it is difficult to interpret 
the meaning of subtracting two variables that are conceptually different from each 
other. They made the point that it is similar to subtracting z-scores of an individual’s 
intelligence and weight. It can be difficult to know what exactly the resultant scores 
indicate.
Hoffman and Schraw also noted that as z-scores are norm-referenced, the effi-
ciency measure can only be based on group data and consequently cannot be used 
for comparing individual efficiency. On the other hand, they also suggested that 
provided differences in overall treatments are being compared, problems with com-
parisons of individual efficiency are not an issue. As will be shown in Part IV, most 
of the studies conducted under the umbrella of cognitive load theory focus entirely 
on overall group differences, therefore individual comparisons have not been an 
issue. As an alternative to the deviation model, Hoffman and Schraw described the 
advantages of two other methods (1) the likelihood model, based on a ratio of per-
formance and subjective rating (e.g. the scale used in Kalyuga and Sweller, 2005; 
Kalyuga, 2008b; see Chapter 13 for more details) and (2) the conditional likelihood 
model, based on ratios of probabilities.
Hoffman and Schraw do not discount the deviation model, arguing that different 
models suit different research goals. If the aim is to investigate the difference 
between performance and effort score ranks then the deviation model of Paas and 
van Merriënboer has merit. Nevertheless, based on the Hoffman and Schraw analysis, 
a ratio of performance and subjective rating (the likelihood model) is very simple 
to calculate and can be used to determine individual efficiency measures. Those 
individual measures can easily be combined to provide the group efficiency that is 
essential when comparing overall treatment effects. We expect future research to 
make greater use of likelihood models.
Measuring Cognitive Load Through a Secondary Task
The subjective measures described above have been the most frequent instrument 
used to measure cognitive load. However, the traditional method of assessing work-
ing memory load is to use a secondary task (see Britton & Tesser, 1982; Kerr, 1973) 
in combination with a primary task (dual-task methodology). A secondary task 
requires learners to engage in an additional cognitive activity that is secondary to 
the primary task of learning or problem solving. For example, as well as learning 
how to solve a class of mathematics problems as the primary task, learners may be 

78
6 Measuring Cognitive Load
asked to respond in a particular way to a specific sound as the secondary task. If the 
primary task imposes a heavy cognitive load, performance on the secondary task 
deteriorates. In contrast, a lower cognitive load on the primary task can result in 
improved performance on the secondary task.
Usually, the secondary task is quite dissimilar and requires less working memory 
resources than the primary task; however, Sweller (1988) created an alternative to 
this format. Sweller reasoned that asking students to learn through problem solving 
involved two processes: (1) solving the problem, the primary task and (2) learning 
from the experience, the secondary task. In other words, when learners treat solving 
the problem as the primary task, this may interfere with learning about the problem, 
which students treat as the secondary task. The more complex the problem, the less 
might be learned about it. Empirical evidence based on a specific secondary task 
consisting of remembering the givens and the solution of a preceding problem sup-
ported this argument. Instructional processes intended to reduce the cognitive load 
associated with solving a problem increased the amount of information that was 
remembered about the previous problem.
In a more traditional use of a secondary task, Marcus et al. (1996) investigated 
element interactivity, and in particular how a diagram can reduce element interac-
tivity compared with the same information presented as text only. In this study, two 
types of secondary tasks were used, with a learning episode constituting the pri-
mary task in each case. In one experiment, the secondary task was recognising a 
tone presented at random during the learning episode. On hearing the tone, learners 
had to respond to it by pressing a foot pedal. Response time was used as a measure 
of how cognitively demanding the primary task was, indicating cognitive load. In a 
second experiment, the secondary task was remembering two-digit numbers that 
were presented during learning episode. In this case, accuracy of recall of the sec-
ondary task was used as a measure of cognitive load. For both types of secondary 
measures, significant results were found matching the learning outcomes. Using 
diagrams and low element interactivity materials led to better learning outcomes 
and stronger performance on secondary tasks. Hence a cognitive load explanation 
was supported.
Chandler and Sweller (1996) also used a dual-task methodology to show that 
the secondary task, recalling a letter, was affected by the instructional mode. For this 
secondary task, two separate letters, prompted by tones, were presented 8 s apart 
on a computer screen during acquisition. Learners were required to recall the first 
letter while remembering the second letter. Results indicated that the superior learning 
strategy intended to reduce cognitive load resulted in higher scores on the secondary 
task. Furthermore, significant differences were only found for instructional strate-
gies and secondary measures when learning materials were high in element inter-
activity. For materials that were low in element interactivity, more working memory 
resources were available to overcome inefficient learning strategies and so perfor-
mance on secondary tasks was not affected. On problem-solving tasks, in contrast 
to learning tasks, Halford, Maybery, and Bain (1986) and Ayres (2001) used a sec-
ondary task method to demonstrate that high element interactivity is associated 
with a correspondingly high working memory load.

79
Measuring Cognitive Load Through a Secondary Task
Brünken, Steinbacher, Plass, and Leutner (2002) required learners to monitor the 
change of colour of a letter that was positioned above the main instructional pre-
sentation. When the letter changed colour, learners were required to press a key on 
the computer keyboard. Reaction times in this secondary task were used as a mea-
sure of cognitive load. The secondary task results indicated that cognitive load was 
lowest for the best-performing learning approach, again supporting the cognitive 
load theory predictions.
In the previously described study, the secondary task was visual. In a follow-up 
study, Brünken, Plass, and Leutner (2004) investigated the impact of an audio sec-
ondary task. Using an argument based on the assumption that audio and visual 
materials are processed in different subsystems of working memory (see Baddeley, 
1986), Brünken et al. (2004) reasoned that different modes (audio or visual) of 
secondary tasks will detect variations of cognitive load in different working mem-
ory channels. More specifically an auditory secondary task will identify differences 
in cognitive load in the auditory channel. This hypothesis was tested using the same 
learning materials as Brünken et  al. (2002), but with a changed secondary 
task. Instead of recognising a colour change, a single tone (sound) was randomly 
inserted into the learning materials. Reaction times were then used to identify 
differences in cognitive load. As predicted, learning materials that included audi-
tory information used more resources in the auditory working memory channel 
than learning material with no auditory component. These two studies (Brünken 
et  al., 2002, 2004) demonstrated that the modality of the secondary task is an 
important consideration.
Van Gerven, Paas, van Merriënboer, and Schmidt (2006) also used a secondary 
task while investigating audio-visual instructional materials. In this study, the sec-
ondary task was detection of illumination of a jukebox button positioned in front of 
the learning material. In this study, an audio-visual format was compared with a 
purely visual presentation, and the impact of age investigated. Learning results 
indicated that young learners performed better than elderly learners but no effect 
was found due to the modality of the material. The secondary task mirrored these 
results: young learners had quicker reaction times than the older learners. Further, 
subjective measures of cognitive load (difficulty) were also collected, showing 
significant age and modality differences. Interestingly, even though no effect due to 
modality was found on test performance, the subjective measure found the dual-
mode presentation to be rated easier than the single mode. It appeared that under 
these conditions, the subjective measure was more sensitive to cognitive load varia-
tions that the secondary task.
Cognitive load theory research has made far less use of secondary tasks than of 
subjective measures as an indicator of cognitive load. Ease of use probably provides 
the major reason for this differential use of the two measures. Subjective measures can 
be obtained easily and quickly. They can be used when testing learners individually or 
in whole classes without specialised equipment. In contrast, secondary tasks require 
much more planning and, depending on the nature of the secondary task, may 
require equipment. They can interfere with normal classroom practice to a much 
greater extent than subjective measures.

80
6 Measuring Cognitive Load
Nevertheless, there are advantages to using secondary tasks. The main advantage 
is that they can provide an almost continuous measure of cognitive load during a 
task, whereas subjective measures only indicate total cognitive load after a task has 
been completed. Physiological measures, discussed in the next section, potentially 
can provide an even more accurate measure of instantaneous cognitive load.
As far as we are aware, efficiency measures have not been calculated using sec-
ondary tasks. There is no reason why they should not be calculated. All of the 
efficiency measures discussed by Hoffman and Schraw (2010) can be just as easily 
calculated using secondary tasks as using subjective ratings, once a cognitive load 
value has been established.
Physiological Measures of Cognitive Load
Paas and van Merriënboer (1994) compared a subjective measure with spectral 
analysis of heart rate, concluding that the subjective measure showed more poten-
tial. Few, if any, follow-up physiological studies were conducted by cognitive load 
theory researchers in the following decade. However, in more recent times, there 
has been a re-emergence of interest in these measures. Cognitive papillary response 
is one strategy that has been tested. Van Gerven, Paas, van Merriënboer, and 
Schmidt (2004), citing the work of Kahneman and Beatty (1966), argued that pupil 
size could be related to memory load. Using a series of tasks that required differ-
ences in memory load, support was found for the suggestion that pupil dilation 
increased according to increased levels of memory load. However, it was also found 
that the papillary response strategy could have age limitations, as elderly partici-
pants did not show this correlation on some cognitive tasks.
Commentators have advocated using techniques such as functional magnetic 
resonance imaging (fMRI, see Paas, Ayres, & Pachman, 2008; Whelan, 2007) and 
electroencephalography (EEG, see Antonenko, Paas, Grabner & van Gog, 2010) 
to measure cognitive load. This interest coincided with the development of more 
sophisticated technologies. Evidence has started to emerge that physiological meth-
ods may have considerable merit. For example, Antonenko and Niederhauser 
(2010) collected both subjective and EEG measures in a study that investigated 
learning with hypertexts. A mental effort scale was used as the subjective measure 
and the EEG captured alpha, beta and theta brain wave rhythms. Performance 
scores indicated that using hypertext leads (introductory text linking nodes together) 
resulted in better learning outcomes than using hypertext without leads. Whereas 
no between-group differences were found for the mental effort measure, alpha, beta 
and theta measures were significantly lower in the hypertext lead groups. It was 
concluded that hypertext leads lowered cognitive load, but only the EEG measure 
was sensitive enough to show this difference. In discussing the failure of the subjec-
tive method, Antonenko and Niederhauser argued that an advantage of the EEG 
method was that it reflected various types of load, such as instantaneous, peak, 
average, accumulated, as well as overall load, whereas the subjective measure could 

81
Measuring the Different Types of Cognitive Load
measure only overall load. (For more information on temporal aspects of cognitive 
load see Xie & Salvendy, 2000.)
Van Gog, Rikers, and Ayres (2008) also discussed the advantages of an instan-
taneous measurement of cognitive load. Van Gog et  al. distinguished between 
online methods, such as eye tracking and heart-rate monitoring that can be col-
lected during learning and testing, and offline data, such as subjective measures that 
can only be collected after an activity has been completed without disrupting the 
task. Over the last few years, research into cognitive load theory and multimedia 
instructional environments have used eye tracking to gain further insights into cog-
nitive processes (see van Gog & Scheiter, 2010). Some evidence has also emerged 
that eye tracking can be used to measure fluctuations in cognitive load. Underwood, 
Jebbert, and Roberts (2004) found that different combinations of text and pictures 
required different levels of cognitive processing, which were matched by corre-
sponding variations in eye fixations. Overall, it has been argued that longer eye 
fixations reflect more cognitive processing. Consequently, eye-tracking data has 
significant merit, as it not only indicates where the learner focuses attention, but 
also for how long, thus implying corresponding variations in cognitive load.
Another online strategy that has shown potential is the use of indicators of lan-
guage complexity. While not physiological in nature, speech complexity shares 
many characteristics of physiological measures, including the ability to be used 
online, simultaneously with learning and testing tasks. Khawaja, Chen, and Marcus 
(2010) reasoned that as task difficulty increases, lexical density of speech decreases. 
This effect was demonstrated in a study with bushfire incident management teams. 
As bushfire tasks became more challenging, including the occurrence of unex-
pected events, the speech patterns of the operating teams changed, becoming less 
dense according to task complexity. Hence measures of language complexity are 
potentially another useful online indicator of cognitive load.
After an inauspicious start, indicators of cognitive load that can be used as an 
alternative to subjective measures, such as physiological indicators, are garnering 
considerable current research interest. Some techniques are promising but it is still 
too early to determine whether the current research emphasis will result in solid 
results. In the past, physiological measures have proved insufficiently sensitive to 
indicate the differences in cognitive load generated by the instructional designs 
used by cognitive load theory. It remains to be seen whether the current attempts to 
find sufficiently sensitive physiological measures will prove successful.
Measuring the Different Types of Cognitive Load
Following the identification of different categories of cognitive load (see Sweller, 
van Merriënboer, & Paas, 1998), theoretical predictions based on cognitive load 
became more sophisticated. Instead of just using total cognitive load to argue why 
an instructional design would, or would not, be effective, researchers started to dif-
ferentiate between categories of cognitive load in formulating their hypotheses.

6 Measuring Cognitive Load
Hence, in the last decade there has been much interest in obtaining individual measures 
of different types of cognitive load.
Theoretically, assuming that intrinsic and extraneous cognitive load add to the 
total cognitive load, it is a simple matter to distinguish between intrinsic and extra-
neous cognitive load by experimental means. In an instructional experiment, if 
intrinsic cognitive load is kept constant but extraneous cognitive load is varied 
between instructional conditions, any differences in cognitive load measures as 
indicated by subjective rating scales must be due to extraneous cognitive load. 
Similarly, by keeping extraneous cognitive load constant and varying intrinsic cog-
nitive load, any measured differences must be due to differences in intrinsic cogni-
tive load. Ayres (2006a) used this logic in one of the first attempts to measure 
intrinsic cognitive load.
Using problem-solving tasks Ayres (2006a) asked students to complete a set of 
algebraic problems requiring consecutive computations. As students had already 
received instruction on these tasks previously with no additional instruction pro-
vided, Ayres reasoned that extraneous cognitive load due to instructional factors was 
constant. In a previous study, Ayres (2001) found that students exhibited specific 
error profiles according to the location of the computations. Some computations 
were higher in element interactivity than others, leading to greater error rates at those 
points. In the Ayres (2006a) study, as students completed each problem they were 
asked to rate ‘how easy or difficult’ they found each computation. Results indicated 
a consistent match between the difficulty ratings and the error patterns. Through 
their subjective ratings, students were in effect able to identify significant differences 
in element interactivity (intrinsic cognitive load) within problems. It was also found 
that students with more domain-specific knowledge were better at identifying differ-
ences in intrinsic load through their ratings than those with less knowledge. Most 
likely expertise enabled students to reflect more deeply on the internal processes 
involved in each computation and rate load more accurately as a result. Even though 
students with high levels of domain-specific knowledge made few errors, they were 
still able to differentiate element interactivity levels. In this study, there was no 
attempt to provide separate measures of different categories of cognitive load. 
Rather, extraneous cognitive load was kept constant and so any differences in load 
could be assumed to be due to intrinsic load.
DeLeeuw and Mayer (2008) used a mixed approach consisting of subjective 
measures and a secondary task to investigate if different instruments could measure 
intrinsic, extraneous and germane cognitive load separately. DeLeeuw and Mayer 
argued that intrinsic cognitive load could be manipulated by increasing the number 
of explanatory sentences in a multimedia lesson and extraneous load by varying 
redundant material consisting of the same spoken and written text. Performance on 
transfer tasks was considered a measure of germane cognitive load. Three measures 
of cognitive load were collected: response time to a secondary task consisting of a 
background change of colour during the lesson, subjective mental effort rating col-
lected during the lesson and subjective difficulty ratings collected after the lesson. 
Over two experiments it was found that the secondary task was most sensitive to 
manipulations of redundancy (extraneous load), mental effort ratings were most 

83
Measuring the Different Types of Cognitive Load
sensitive to changes in sentence complexity (intrinsic load) and difficulty ratings 
were most sensitive to differences in transfer success. Students who scored high on 
the transfer test were assumed to have invested more germane effort, while those 
who scored low, less germane effort.
These findings indicate that different measures can tap into different processes 
and show varying sensitivities. However, there may be some doubt whether the 
three measures used can distinguish different types of cognitive load. It is not clear 
why a secondary task should be more sensitive to extraneous cognitive load than 
mental effort ratings or why mental effort ratings should be particularly sensitive to 
intrinsic cognitive load. Furthermore, we doubt whether transfer performance is 
necessarily a measure of germane load. In addition, it needs to be noted that accord-
ing to the current formulation, germane cognitive load is merely a reflection of the 
amount of load imposed by intrinsic element interactivity and so does not indepen-
dently contribute to the total load. Nevertheless, it is interesting that these different 
measures yielded different results depending on the nature of the manipulation. 
Very few other studies (for other examples see Cierniak, Scheiter, & Gerjets, 2009b; 
van Gerven et al., 2003) have used both subjective ratings and secondary task mea-
sure of cognitive load in the same study.
In trying to measure different aspects of cognitive load some researchers have 
been influenced by a multidimensional scale called the NASA Task Load Index 
(NASA-TLX, Hart & Staveland, 1988). The NASA-TLX consists of six subscales 
that measure different factors associated with completing a task: (1) mental demands 
(How much mental and perceptual activity was required?), (2) physical 
demands (How much physical activity was required?), (3) temporal demands (How 
much time pressure occurred?), (4) performance (How successful do you think you 
were in accomplishing the goals of the task set by the experimenter?), (5) effort 
(How hard did you have to work – mentally and physically – to accomplish your 
level of performance?), and (6) frustration level (How insecure, discouraged, irri-
tated, stressed versus secure, content and relaxed did you feel during the task?). An 
overall measure of mental load is achieved by combining the six subscales.
In a recent reflection on its use, Hart (2006) points out that the NASA-TLX scale 
has mainly been used in studies that have focused on interface designs and evalua-
tions, including the impact of automation and decision aids. Furthermore, consis-
tent with its original design for aviation use, many studies have focused on air 
traffic control and other aeronautical activities. In contrast, cognitive load theory 
researchers have focused on learning environments and often modified the instru-
ment by selecting only some of the subscales, as well as changing the wording of 
the items. In an attempt to measure the different cognitive load categories, Gerjets, 
Scheiter, and Catrambone (2006) selected three items from the NASA-TLX (see 
also Gerjets, Scheiter, & Catrambone, 2004). They were ‘task demands’ (how much 
mental and physical activity was required to accomplish the learning task), ‘effort’ 
(how hard the participant had to work to understand the contents of the learning 
environment), and ‘navigational demands’ (how much effort the participant had to 
invest to navigate the learning environment). Gerjets et al. (2006) argued that each of 
these items could correspond to intrinsic, germane and extraneous load, respectively. 

84
6 Measuring Cognitive Load
Results from a study that manipulated the complexity of worked examples indi-
cated that there was broad agreement with the test performance data. In other 
words, groups with the highest learning outcomes reported lowest cognitive load. 
However, there was no collaborating evidence that the three measures corresponded 
to different types of cognitive loads as proposed.
In the search for more differentiated measures of cognitive load, there has also 
been a tendency to align the wording of the items with the notion of what the dif-
ferent types of load represent. For example Cierniak et al. (2009b, p. 318) used 
items such as ‘How difficult was the learning content for you? How difficult was it 
for you to learn with the material? How much did you concentrate during learning?’ 
The choice of wording was intended to link ‘learning content’ with intrinsic load, 
and to link ‘learning with the material’ with extraneous load. It was argued that 
concentration reflects attention to the learning-relevant processes and therefore 
represents germane load. In this study, significant matches were found between the 
cognitive load measures and the performance data.
However, sometimes matches between test performance and the cognitive load 
measures do not coincide with theoretical predictions. Gerjets, Scheiter, Opfermann, 
Hesse, and Eysink (2009) used further variations of wording. Students were asked 
to rate the ‘difficulty of the domain’ (intended intrinsic load) and ‘how much effort 
they made in understanding the examples’ (intended germane load). For extraneous 
load two items were used: ‘differentiate between important and unimportant infor-
mation’, and ‘rate the difficulty of dealing with the environment’. However, this 
study did not find the expected match between the cognitive load measures and 
learning outcomes.
The above inconsistencies in psychometric attempts to measure different types of 
cognitive load are not unexpected. Psychometric distinctions between categories 
of cognitive load require learners to indicate whether the cognitive load that they are 
experiencing is due to a particular category of cognitive load. We doubt learners, 
particularly novice ones, are capable of making the required distinctions. For exam-
ple, when attempting to learn some new concepts, learners may be able to accurately 
indicate the extent to which they are finding the task difficult. They may be much less 
accurate in attributing their difficulty to the intrinsic nature of the material or the man-
ner in which the material is being presented. In most cases, unless they are aware of 
relevant, alternative instructional procedures such as the ones discussed in Part IV of 
this book, learners may have no conception of how the instructional procedures could 
change. If learners are not familiar with instructional design principles, they are not 
in a position to indicate whether the level of difficulty they are experiencing is due to 
an inadequate instructional design or due to the natural complexity of the information 
with which they are dealing. Under these circumstances, psychometric procedures 
designed to indicate whether cognitive load is due to one category rather than another 
are likely to fail (Kirschner, Ayres, & Chandler, 2011).
There is an alternative to psychometric measurement of the categories of cogni-
tive load. Randomised, controlled experiments that vary one category while keep-
ing the other constant provide a good indicator of the independence of intrinsic and 
extraneous categories of cognitive load and simultaneously indicate the relevant

Summary
instructional consequences. Since relative intrinsic or extraneous cognitive load can 
be determined experimentally as discussed in Part IV, our inability to determine the 
effect of categories of cognitive load using psychometric means is not critical.
Summary
This chapter has outlined the main methods used by researchers to measure cogni-
tive load. It has described how in the early stages of cognitive load theory, indirect 
methods such as error rates, time on task and computational models were used to 
provide evidence that various instructional effects could be explained by fluctua-
tions in cognitive load. These indirect measures, used in conjunction with perfor-
mance test scores, strengthened the theory. A significant move away from indirect 
measures occurred when Paas (1992) proposed a single-scale subjective measure of 
mental effort. This measure and its derivative (the difficulty scale), as well as mea-
sures of instructional efficiency, have been used in scores of studies and have been 
invaluable tools in the development of cognitive load theory. In most instances, the 
subjective measures have provided collaborating evidence in support of all cogni-
tive load theory effects. Nevertheless, subjective rating scales do not provide real-
time, concurrent data. They only provide an indicator of cognitive load after the 
event and so cannot be used to determine changes in cognitive load during learning 
or problem solving. An alternative measure that is able to provide concurrent data 
is the use of a secondary task.
Secondary tasks have been used less frequently than subjective rating scales 
because they tend to be more intrusive and require more complex experimental 
conditions and, frequently, more complex equipment. The advantage of secondary 
tasks, that is their ability to measure cognitive load during learning and problem 
solving, is also a disadvantage. They can be difficult to use. In contrast, subjective 
rating scales can be presented immediately after a learning or problem-solving 
episode and usually require no more than about 30 s to administer. Nevertheless, 
secondary tasks have been used successfully in cognitive load theory research to 
show predicted variations in cognitive load. Other simultaneous and continuous 
methods of determining cognitive load such as eye tracking and physiological 
methods such as the use of EEG data have started to emerge as potential measures 
but are still in the early phase of testing and yet to be proven effective.
In summary, a number of methods have been used to measure cognitive load. The 
subjective scale of mental effort or difficulty has had the most use and has been very 
successfully employed. One of its great strengths is that it is easy to use and is very 
unobtrusive. In contrast, attempts to subjectively measure the different types of cog-
nitive load have been much less successful. Whereas we need to distinguish the 
categories of cognitive load, we seriously doubt whether psychometric techniques 
can meaningfully differentiate these constructs, especially when studying the learn-
ing of novices. The alternative, to use appropriate experimental designs, has repeat-
edly proven to be successful. Part IV discusses the results of such experiments.

 

The theory outlined in the previous three parts has been developed incrementally 
over a 30-year period. It has had a single, over-riding goal – the generation of 
novel, instructional procedures. The ability to generate instructional procedures 
provides the ultimate criterion of cognitive load theory’s success or failure.
Part IV describes the instructional procedures generated by the theory. Each 
procedure flows from a cognitive load effect where an effect is an experimental 
demonstration that an instructional procedure based on cognitive load theory prin-
ciples facilitates learning or problem solving compared to a more traditional proce-
dure. The use of replicable, randomised, controlled experiments is essential to this 
process. Each effect discussed in Part IV has been demonstrated on multiple occa-
sions by numerous researchers. Each demonstration consists of, at a minimum, a 
control condition in which learners are taught in a conventional fashion and an 
experimental condition that varies from the control condition on one factor and one 
factor only. Participants are randomly allocated to either the control or experimental 
condition. Most commonly, there are two phases to each experiment. During an 
acquisition or learning phase, learners are taught according to either a conventional, 
traditional procedure or according to a new procedure generated by cognitive load 
theory. A second phase, the test phase, follows in which all learners are presented 
a common test to see if there are any differences in learning outcomes. If statistical 
analyses on the test results demonstrate that learning has been facilitated by the new 
procedure, a new cognitive load effect has been demonstrated and a superior 
instructional procedure generated. All of the effects described in Part IV are based 
on this procedure or more sophisticated variants.
The generation of novel, effective instructional designs has two major conse-
quences. First, and most obviously, we have a new, better way of organising instruc-
tion. Second, the ability of a theory to generate instructional procedures inevitably 
strengthens the theory. While no theory can ever be final, complete or entirely valid 
with all theories requiring, at the very least, revision and ultimately replacement, 
the ability of a theory to produce practical implications provides one of the stron-
gest forms of validation available. Cognitive load theory has produced many 
instructional applications and those applications are discussed in Part IV.
Part IV
Cognitive Load Effects

 

89
The goal-free effect was the first instructional effect investigated within a ­cognitive 
load theory framework. Goal-free problems occur when a conventional problem 
with a specific goal is replaced by a problem with a non-specific goal. For example, 
in high school geometry, a typical problem will ask students to calculate a specific 
angle, such as angle ABC. In contrast, goal-free problems will not require students 
to specifically calculate this angle, but use a more general wording such as ‘calculate 
the value of as many angles as you can’. This particular wording of the problem will 
still allow students to calculate the targeted angle of the conventional problem 
(angle ABC), but students are free to calculate as many other angles as they can, 
and are not required to focus on one ultimate goal. Goal-free problems are 
­sometimes called no-goal problems, and the goal-free effect is sometimes referred 
to as the goal-specificity effect. Consider an example taken from the domain of 
geometry. The goal-free effect occurs when students, having solved goal-free 
­problems with an instruction to ‘calculate the value of as many angles as you can’ 
during acquisition, demonstrate superior learning outcomes to students who have 
solved the equivalent, conventional problems that include a goal such as ‘calculate 
the value of angle ABC’.
The origins of the goal-free effect partly originate from some of the early work 
on expertise. When novices solve a conventional problem, they will frequently 
work backwards from the goal to the givens using a means–ends strategy (Larkin, 
McDermott, Simon, & Simon, 1980a, b; Simon & Simon 1978). For example, 
when novices are faced with a geometry problem requiring them to find a value for 
angle ABC, they tend to focus on the goal and work backwards using means–ends 
analysis, trying to find a set of connections to the givens. In contrast, experts, using 
schemas held in long-term memory, know the solution and are more likely to work 
forward from the givens to the goal. Their schemas tell them that for this problem 
with these givens and this goal, this is the best set of moves.
Working backwards using a means–ends strategy requires knowledge of the 
goal. If we do not know the goal, we cannot work backwards from it. We can only 
work forwards from the givens. Furthermore, we cannot reduce differences between 
the goal and the givens if the goal has not been identified for us. All we can do is

7 The Goal-Free Effect
work forward, considering one move at a time. Why should the elimination of a 
means–ends strategy be beneficial?
As indicated in Chapter 5, the means–ends strategy used by novices is an effec-
tive method of solving a problem but imposes a heavy cognitive load. Problem 
solvers are required to simultaneously consider the problem givens, the goal, the 
differences between the givens and the goal and the problem-solving operators 
that might reduce those differences. Each of these elements interact, resulting in 
very high levels of element interactivity. Furthermore, if the aim of problem-
solving instruction is to learn to recognise problem states and the best moves 
associated with each state, the high levels of element interactivity associated with 
means–ends analysis constitute an extraneous cognitive load that should be 
reduced. Working memory may be overwhelmed by a means–ends strategy, reduc-
ing or even preventing learning.
In contrast, by creating a goal-free environment, learning is not dominated by 
strategies to connect a goal to the givens. Instead, the learner is focused only on 
the present problem state and how to get to any other state. By emphasising the 
current state and any move that can be made from the current state, the load on 
working memory is reduced leaving more capacity for learning. In terms of 
­element interactivity, instead of having to consider givens, the goal, possible dif-
ferences between the givens and the goal and operators that might reduce those 
differences, goal-free problem solving just requires problem solvers to consider 
the givens and any possible move. The reduction in interacting elements can result 
in a reduction in extraneous cognitive load and so enhance learning.
With respect to the cognitive architecture described in Part II, goal-free problem 
solving by reducing working memory load (narrow limits of change principle) 
increases the amount of relevant information that can be transferred to long-term 
memory (information store principle). Once stored in long-term memory, the 
­environmental organising and linking principle allows that information to be used 
to solve subsequent problems.
Support for a cognitive load explanation of the goal-free effect was provided by 
Sweller (1988) who used a computational model to obtain a priori information 
concerning cognitive load (see Chapter 6). Firstly, using the computational model 
to simulate cognitive processes, Sweller demonstrated that a means–ends strategy 
to solving simple kinematics problems required significantly more inputs and com-
putations than a goal-free approach. Secondly, Sweller reasoned that asking stu-
dents to learn through problem solving involved two processes: solving the problem 
and learning from the experience. If more cognitive resources were required to 
solve the problem using a conventional rather than goal-free approach, fewer 
resources would be available to learn under a conventional approach leading to the 
superiority of goal-free problem solving. In an experiment using trigonometry 
materials, Sweller compared a conventional goal approach with a goal-free 
approach. Over a set of problems, the goal-free group gained more knowledge 
about the structure of the problems than the goal-specific group. Together, the com-
putational model and empirical data provided further understanding of the goal-free 
effect and supported the cognitive load explanation.

91
Empirical Evidence for the Goal-Free Effect
Empirical Evidence for the Goal-Free Effect
During the early development of cognitive load theory, means–ends analysis was 
hypothesised as a major impediment to efficient learning. Research by Mawer and 
Sweller (1982) and Sweller, Mawer, and Howe (1982) found that means–ends 
analysis did not promote rule induction or acquisition of specific procedural 
­schemas. Although problems could be solved by using simple heuristics, little 
learning occurred. Preventing or reducing means–ends analysis during problem 
solving could be achieved by removing the goal. A study by Sweller and Levine 
(1982) using puzzle problems showed that students would learn more if the prob-
lem goal was removed than if the problem goal was retained. Sweller and Levine 
showed that problem solvers who were aware of the location of a maze problem’s 
goal made more errors than problem solvers who did not know the goal’s location. 
The maze could be solved by using a simple rule. Over a series of experiments, 
Sweller and Levine showed that the more learners knew about the goal, the less 
they learned about the problem structure including the solution rule. Sweller and 
Levine argued that those with a goal were prevented from acquiring this informa-
tion because of their focus on using means–ends analysis. A further study by 
Sweller (1983) using maze problems and the Tower of Hanoi puzzle demonstrated 
that means–ends analysis also prevented transfer effects.
Following these findings using puzzle problems, Sweller, Mawer, and Ward 
(1983) broadened the research to school-based curricula. Firstly, Sweller et  al. 
demonstrated the advantages of a goal-free approach using simple physics prob-
lems. In this experiment, the goal group were given traditionally worded problems 
such as ‘find the distance travelled by the racing car’, whereas the goal-free group 
were instructed to ‘calculate the value of as many variables as you can’. Results 
indicated that the goal-free group more readily switched to a forward-working 
strategy rather than continuing to use means–ends analysis on subsequent prob-
lems. Students in this goal-free group also used equations differently to the goal 
group. Instead of simply writing down the equations, a feature of the goal group, 
the goal-free group wrote down the equations with completed substitutions of the 
given values. The ability to write down equations and simultaneously substitute into 
them provided evidence of a reduction in cognitive load. Sweller et al. also found 
similar differences in strategy use with geometry problems.
Further evidence for the effectiveness of a goal-free approach came from Owen 
and Sweller (1985) using trigonometry problems. A conventional textbook approach 
simply asks mathematics students to calculate the length of a side of a geometric 
figure. To carry out this calculation, students may first have to find the length of 
another side acting as a subgoal. The problem solution may require two steps 
whereby the subgoal has to be calculated before the goal can be found. To turn this 
problem into a goal-free format, it only is necessary for the instructions to be 
modified to: ‘Calculate all the unknown sides in the diagram’. The advantage of 
the goal-free approach is that students can start calculating values immediately 
without first finding a specific solution path by working backwards from the goal.  
Students do need prior knowledge of the trigonometric ratios (tangent, sine and 

92
7 The Goal-Free Effect
cosine) to solve goal-free problems in this domain, but such problems do not 
impose the ­additional working memory load associated with a search for solution 
paths that a specific goal demands. All students have to do is find a side that fits a 
trigonometrical equation where the other variables are known. Once the initial cal-
culations are made, further calculations can be made using the newly calculated 
values. The elimination of the interacting elements associated with searching for a 
solution path can substantially reduce extraneous cognitive load.
In the Owen and Sweller (1985) study, one group of students who completed 
goal-free problems during a learning acquisition phase were compared with a goal 
group who completed conventional problems with a specific goal. Total acquisition 
time was kept constant. Results indicated that during acquisition, the goal-free 
group calculated twice as many sides as the goal group, but with a significantly 
reduced error rate. On a post-acquisition test, where both groups were given 
­conventional test problems, the goal-free group was five times as accurate as the 
goal group. Furthermore, it was found that students in the goal-free group were 
better able to transfer their knowledge to structurally different problems.
Trigonometry problems of the type discussed above are classified as transforma-
tion problems because they have an initial state, a goal state and a set of operators 
to transform the givens into the goal state (Greeno, 1978). Many problems requiring 
geometrical figures have these features and are also likely to be solved using 
means–ends analysis by novice learners in the domain.
Ayres and Sweller (1990) obtained direct evidence from verbal protocols of high 
school students that means–ends analysis was used with transformation problems 
in geometry. Furthermore, they found that students made significantly more errors 
calculating the subgoal angle compared with the goal angle. This finding provided 
direct evidence that locating and calculating the subgoal using means–ends analysis 
was more demanding on working memory than calculating the goal. A later study 
by Ayres (1993) showed that a goal-free approach alleviated this problem associ-
ated with the subgoal. Ayres constructed a geometry problem set in which it was 
only possible to calculate two angles, a goal angle and a subgoal angle. A goal 
group (find a value for angle X) was compared with a goal-free group (find as many 
unknown angles as possible). Because of the structure of the problems, both groups 
could only find the same angles and the problem space was identical. However, 
results indicated the goal-free group made significantly fewer errors than the goal 
group. By preventing means–ends analysis, goal-free students were able to adopt a 
different problem-solving strategy in a short space of time.
Bobis, Sweller, and Cooper (1994) collected further information on the goal-free 
effect in the geometry domain with primary-school students. In learning paper 
­folding tasks, students were given a sheet of paper and instructions on how to fold 
the paper into a particular geometric shape. Students were either provided no 
­further help (goal-free) or a physical model of the final desired shape (goal group). 
It was predicted that the physical model would be equivalent to having a goal. 
Results indicated that the goal-free group learned the paper folding steps signifi-
cantly better than the group who were provided with the finished model. It may be 
assumed that the presence of the finished model enticed the students to work back-
wards from the final state using means–ends analysis.

93
Alternative Explanations of the Goal-Free Effect
Ayres (1998) conducted a further study in the mathematics domain by using 
problems that required consecutive uses of the Pythagorean theorem. A two-step 
trigonometry problem was used in which a subgoal had to be calculated before a 
side, acting as the goal, could be calculated. Results again indicated that the goal-
free approach facilitated learning compared to conventional problems.
Paas, Camp, and Rikers (2001) investigated how goal specificity interacted with 
age. Using maze-tracing problems, Paas et al. compared a goal-free strategy (invis-
ible goal) with a goal strategy (visible goal) using younger adults (mean age of 20 
years) and older adults (mean age of 72 years). The younger adults outperformed 
the older ones, but the goal-free strategy was found to be helpful for both groups. 
On such performance characteristics as the number of steps to solution and time 
taken, the goal-free groups were superior to the goal groups. An important interac-
tion was also observed indicating that use of a goal-free strategy decreased the 
performance difference between the two age ranges. In the goal condition, a large 
difference was found between the two age ranges, but this difference narrowed in 
the goal-free condition. This result suggests that a goal-free approach may be even 
more useful for older rather than younger adults. Paas et al. argued that working 
memory capabilities decrease with age, and thus using goal-specific strategies like 
means–ends analysis with its heavy demands on working memory may be particu-
larly deleterious. In contrast, a goal-free approach allows more working memory 
resources to be directly devoted to learning.
Miller, Lehman, and Koedinger (1999) used an interactive game called Electric 
Field Hockey that simulated the movement of an electrically charged particle. 
Three different strategies were compared: (a) a goal-free condition where students 
were asked to ‘experiment’ and ‘learn to understand the game’s properties in any 
way you feel fit’; (b) a goal condition where students played a game where they had 
to reach a specific goal, which became progressively more difficult over a series of 
trials; (c) a specific-path condition which had the same task as the goal condition, 
but in which a worked example of a solution path was shown.
On relevant tests of physics principles simulated by the game, results indicated that 
both the goal-free and specific-path groups outperformed the goal group, but there 
was no difference between the former two groups. Thus, a goal-free effect was dem-
onstrated along with a worked example effect (Chapter 8) in which worked examples 
proved superior to conventional problems. As will be shown in Chapter 8, worked 
examples are a highly effective alternative to problem solving with a fixed goal.
Alternative Explanations of the Goal-Free Effect
A Dual-Space Explanation
In a set of studies, Vollmeyer, Burns and colleagues also obtained a goal-free effect, 
but have provided an alternative explanation for the effect, based on dual-space 
theory. Simon and Lea (1974) proposed that a problem space can be divided into a 
rule space in which hypotheses and solution rules are formulated and tested and an 

94
7 The Goal-Free Effect
instance space in which problem-solving moves are made. Vollmeyer, Burns, and 
Holyoak (1996) argued that different types of goals could encourage different types 
of strategies. Setting a specific goal may encourage use of a non-productive strategy 
such as means–ends analysis that does not emphasise a search for rules because it 
involves searching the instance space only. In contrast, a non-specific goal encour-
ages a search for rules and hypotheses in the rule space. In other words, it was 
argued that goal specificity generates different types of strategies and not differ-
ences in cognitive load.
This formulation is plausible and also compatible with cognitive load theory. 
The reason learners search an instance space and ignore a rule space during means–
ends analysis is, according to cognitive load theory, because working memory is 
fully occupied in searching the instance space leaving no resources available to 
search the rule space. If the rule space is not searched, rules cannot be learned. 
During goal-free problem solving, an emphasis on the rule space rather than the 
instance space eliminates this problem because working memory resources are 
directed to the rule space. A superiority of goal-free over conventional problem 
solving is the net result.
Vollmeyer et al. (1996) extended the research on the goal-free effect to a biology-
based, complex, dynamic system, using a computer-driven simulation to construct a 
biological environment. A cover story indicated that there was a tank containing four 
types of sea creatures (crabs, prawns, lobsters and sea bass), which were affected by 
four input variables (temperature, salt, oxygen and current). The outputs of the sys-
tem, the number of each species, were governed by various relationships with the 
input variables. The main task was for students to discover the rules governing 
these relationships. According to Vollmeyer et al., this biology lab task could be 
approached in two different ways. Either students could try to bring the system to a 
particular goal state by manipulating the input variables in order to reduce the dif-
ference between the current output state and the goal state (a means–ends strategy), 
or they could apply hypothesis testing to try to discover the rules of the system. Two 
groups were formed to align with these strategies. The students in the conventional, 
or goal group, were told that they had to manipulate the system to get a specific goal, 
whereas the goal-free group were told to explore the system. Test results indicated 
that the goal-free learners spent less time during acquisition, but scored higher on 
post-acquisition tasks, including transfer. Furthermore, goal-free students were more 
likely to use a strategy that varied one input variable at a time – an essential method 
in scientific research.
Vollmeyer and Burns conducted two further studies linking a dual-space argument 
to the goal-free effect. In the first study, Vollmeyer and Burns (2002) used hyperme-
dia materials to extend the research into a very different type of learning environment. 
In this study, students had to learn about the cause of World War I. Participants in the 
goal group were required to focus on 20 specific events and dates while exploring the 
provided hyperlinks. The goal-free group was free to explore the hyperlinks without 
reference to those events. Tests of various types of knowledge revealed a significant 
goal-free effect with the goal-free group learning more facts, making more inferences 
and having a better understanding of the main theme.

95
Alternative Explanations of the Goal-Free Effect
In their second study, Burns and Vollmeyer (2002) collected verbal protocols in 
order to find more conclusive evidence in support of a dual-space explanation. In 
this study, they used a linear system of inputs and outputs similar to Vollmeyer et al. 
(1996), but the system simulated the control of water quality and was less complex. 
They again demonstrated the goal-free effect. The protocol analysis found that 
students in the goal-free group who were operating within a rule space tended to 
emphasise hypothesis testing, whereas the goal group who were operating within 
an instance space were more goal-orientated.
Geddes and Stevenson (1997) also used a dual-space theoretical argument in a 
goal-specificity study. Using a task designed by Berry and Broadbent (1984) par-
ticipants were required to interact with a computer-generated person. The main aim 
of the task was to try to get the person to reach a required attitude state like ‘very 
polite’. A chain of interactions would be required before the state was reached. 
Underlying this interaction was a particular pattern that the students had to discover 
to reach the desired state. In a three-group design, a goal group was told specifically 
to get the person to a certain state, a goal-free group was told to identify the pattern 
that generated the person’s reaction and a dual-goal group was told to both shift the 
person to a certain level and identify the pattern, thus incorporating elements of 
both other groups. Over a series of trials, the goal-free group outperformed both of 
the other groups on test problems and questions of declarative knowledge. It was 
clear from the fine-grained analyses conducted in this study that the two groups 
with a specific goal did not learn the rule guiding the computer’s behaviour. Geddes 
and Stevenson concluded that a specific goal leads to a focus on an instance space 
with inadequate use of the rule space.
Osman (2008) used the complex dynamic control task on water quality devel-
oped by Burns and Vollmeyer (2002) to not only investigate the goal-specificity 
effect, but also to examine differences between learning by observation and ­learning 
by action. During a learning phase, students either observed the manipulation of 
various inputs and their corresponding outputs, or directly manipulated the inputs 
themselves. In a 2 (goal or goal-free) × 2 (observation or action) design, Osman 
replicated the findings of Burns and Vollmeyer, showing that the goal-free groups 
scored higher during the learning phase and on post-acquisition tests targeting 
knowledge of procedural control and causal structure. Interestingly, no difference 
was found between the groups who learned by observation and those who learned 
by action. A goal-free advantage was obtained irrespective of whether learners 
solved problems themselves or observed the moves made by someone else either 
solving a conventional problem or solving a goal-free problem. This result 
­suggested that with such complex dynamic control tasks, observation is just as 
effective as learning ‘by doing’. Osman also concluded from the collected evidence 
about acquired procedural and declarative knowledge that hypothesis testing within 
a rule space was more likely to generate knowledge in this domain than the proce-
dural tasks associated with controlling the inputs within an instance space.
In conclusion, studies testing the hypothesis that the goal-free effect is a con-
sequence of problem solvers attending to an instance space rather than a rule 
space have provided some evidence in favour of this hypothesis. Nevertheless, it 

96
7 The Goal-Free Effect
can be argued that an emphasis on the instance space prevents attention to the rule 
space. This argument leads directly to a limited working memory explanation 
proposed by cognitive load theory. Our limited working memory, according to 
this argument, prevents us from attending to both an instance and a rule space 
simultaneously.
An Attentional Focus Explanation
Trumpower, Goldsmith, and Guynn (2004) used an attentional focus explanation to 
explain the goal-free effect. They argued that under goal-free conditions, attention 
is more focused on the current problem state and possible moves. As a result, a 
number of local relations are acquired based on learning the relationships between 
any given state and the variables (givens and knowns) that allow progress to the 
next state. In contrast, with a specific goal, the focus is on trying to link the current 
state with the final goal state, leading to knowledge about how the variables link 
with the goal state, but not about how the variables relate to each other. Consequently, 
a goal-free approach is more likely to lead to knowledge about local relations rather 
than just relations with one goal.
To test this hypothesis in the learning domain of statistics, Trumpower et al. 
(2004) measured structural knowledge, which is the knowledge about the interre-
lationships between the domain concepts (based on the work of Goldsmith, 
Johnson, & Acton, 1991). To measure structural knowledge, participants were 
asked to rate the relatedness of pairs of statistical concepts. A computer algorithm 
was then used to calculate a network representation of each participant’s structural 
knowledge. Through the analysis of these networks it was possible to ascertain 
whether problem solvers formed more links with the goal state or generated more 
local relations. Experimental results indicated a goal-free effect. On the structural 
knowledge indicator, the goal-free group made more local links and less goal links 
than the goal group.
Both the theory and results described by Trumpower et al. (2004) are interest-
ing. It is plausible to suggest that the goal-free effect is caused by problem solvers 
establishing local links rather than links to the goal. Cognitive load theory has 
assumed that learners are more likely to acquire schemas under goal-free than 
conventional goal conditions. Schemas allow learners to recognise problem states 
along with the best moves associated with each state. Acquiring local structural 
knowledge is very similar to the process of schema acquisition. Acquiring links 
to the goal is likely to interfere with local structural knowledge because of our 
limited working memory. If we are acquiring links to the goal, we may have 
insufficient working memory resources to simultaneously attend to local links. 
We assume that limitations in attentional resources can be explained by the lim-
ited capacity of working memory. In other words, a limited working memory 
capacity and limited attentional resources constitute different terminology for the 
same constructs.

97
Conditions of Applicability
A Subjective Measure of Cognitive Load  
and the Goal-Free Effect
Ultimately, whether the goal-free effect is due to a reduction in extraneous cognitive 
load or due to other possibly related factors can be determined by measuring cogni-
tive load. Most studies of the goal-free effect have not collected direct measures of 
cognitive load. As an exception, the production system model used by Sweller 
(1988) provided a priori, indirect measures of cognitive load. Many of the other 
cognitive load effects described in the following chapters have been extensively 
investigated using cognitive load measures. However, most of the studies of the goal-
free effect were conducted prior to the systematic use of subjective measures of 
cognitive load (see Chapter 6). One exception was a study by Wirth, Künsting, and 
Leutner (2009) who used subjective measures of cognitive load based on the NASA-
TLX instrument (task load index, Hart & Staveland, 1988). The main aim of the 
Wirth et  al. study was to investigate the goal-free effect on tasks that either  
had problem-solving goals or those that had learning goals. In the case of specific 
problem-solving goals, it was argued that they generated a pure problem-solving 
strategy, whereas non-specific goals generated a learning strategy. However, if there 
are specific learning goals ­indicated, a learning strategy will be triggered regardless 
of goal-specificity. Using a computer-based science learning tasks, the same materials 
were developed that emphasised either problem-solving or learning goals under 
conventional goal or ­goal-free conditions. Results indicated a goal-free effect for 
learning goals but not for problem-solving goals, as predicted by the researchers. 
Perhaps more importantly, cognitive load measures indicated that the goal-specific 
groups experienced greater cognitive load than goal-free groups. This finding sup-
ports a cognitive load interpretation of the goal-free effect.
Conditions of Applicability
The evidence described in this chapter suggests that presenting goal-free rather than 
goal-specific problems creates an effective learning environment. Goal-free tasks 
are effective because they reduce means–ends problem-solving strategies and the 
extraneous cognitive load associated with trying to achieve a specific goal. Further, 
they facilitate rule induction and the acquisition of schematic knowledge because 
learners are able to focus on more localised relations connected to a particular 
problem state instead of referring to a goal. Reference to a goal may be critical dur-
ing problem solving but not during learning. The various studies described in this 
chapter indicate that a goal-free strategy is effective in transformation problems 
with a limited problem space that involves only a limited number of possible 
moves. In situations with a more extensive problem space, goal-free problems are 
less likely to be useful because of the large number of possible moves available. 
Many of those possible moves may not be important resulting in learning that is less 
relevant to actual instructional goals.

98
7 The Goal-Free Effect
Instructional Implications
Research on the goal-free effect has clear implications for instruction. Under a 
­number of conditions, using goal-free problems represents a very effective alterna-
tive to problem solving with a fixed goal. Conventional problem solving, particularly 
for novices in a domain, should be avoided because of the extraneous cognitive load 
created by search strategies such as means–ends analysis. A significant advantage of 
using goal-free problems is that conventional goal-specific problems can easily be 
adapted to a goal-free format simply by removing reference to a specific goal and 
providing a simple instruction such as: ‘find all of the unknowns you can’. Goal-free 
problems, when used appropriately, may provide significant benefits.
Conclusions
The goal-free effect was the first effect generated by cognitive load theory, following 
early work with mazes and other puzzle problems. Although a very simple and 
highly effective method to counteract the negative influence on learning of using 
search-based problem-solving strategies such as a means–ends analysis, the goal-
free effect has been overshadowed by the worked example effect that similarly 
reduces the use of search-based problem-solving strategies during learning (see 
Chapter 8). Nevertheless, in a limited number of domains, usually involving trans-
formation problems and focused on mathematics and science concepts, a goal-free 
strategy has significantly improved learning outcomes, including transfer. Provided 
the problem space is fairly constrained, eliminating the interacting elements associ-
ated with irrelevant search and unnecessary rule induction, a goal-free strategy may 
be a very useful technique to facilitate learning.

A worked example provides a step-by-step solution to a problem. The following is 
an example from algebra:
Make a the subject of the equation, 
+
=
(
) /
.

Learners can be presented this worked example to study. Alternatively, they can be 
asked to solve a problem. Learners asked to solve a problem are just presented the 
first line of the above worked example, ‘Make a the subject of the equation, 
,
(
)/
+
=
a
b c
d . The worked example effect occurs when learners presented worked 
examples to study perform better on subsequent test problems than learners asked 
to solve the equivalent problem.
The worked example effect flows directly from the cognitive architecture dis-
cussed in the initial parts of this book. Worked examples can efficiently provide us 
with the problem-solving schemas that need to be stored in long-term memory using 
the information store principle. Once stored in long-term memory, we can use the 
stored schemas to solve related problems using the environmental organising and 
linking principle. Those schemas are borrowed from the long-term memory of the 
provider of the worked example by way of the borrowing and reorganising principle. 
Worked examples impose a relatively low working memory load (narrow limits of 
change principle) compared to solving problems using means–ends search. While all 
the necessary, intrinsic interacting elements are encapsulated in the information 
contained within a worked example, solving a problem by means–ends search adds 
the additional elements associated with the randomness as genesis principle. That 
principle unnecessarily adds problem-solving search to the interacting elements, 
thus imposing an extraneous cognitive load. Together, these various mechanisms of 
cognitive load theory suggest that for novice learners, studying worked examples 
should be superior to solving the equivalent problems. There is a wealth of evidence 
supporting this hypothesis collected by researchers from around the globe.

8 The Worked Example and Problem Completion Effects 
Atkinson, Derry, Renkl, and Wortham (2000) observed there is no precise definition 
of a worked example but there are a number of common features found across the 
different types. Most worked examples include a problem statement and procedure for 
solving the problem. By studying a worked example, students are able to learn key 
aspects about the problem and use those aspects to solve other problems. As Atkinson 
et  al. (2000) further remark ‘In a sense, they provide an expert’s problem-solving 
model for the learner to study and emulate’ (p. 181). A number of different synonyms 
have been applied to worked examples such as learning from examples, example-
based learning, learning from model answers and studying expert solutions.
Basic Empirical Evidence
Worked examples are not a recent innovation as teachers, particularly in mathemat-
ics and science, have used them extensively over a long period of time. However, as 
will become evident below, there are optimal ways of presenting worked examples. 
A traditional textbook approach in mathematics and science, when learning new 
concepts and procedures, is to present some initial worked examples and then ask 
students to practice what they have learned in a more extensive exercise including 
unfamiliar problems. Typically, under some conditions, students may only be shown 
further worked examples after failing to find solutions to some of the problems. 
Frequently, worked examples are not even used when students fail to solve a prob-
lem. Under such circumstances, learners are still required to spend a significant time 
on problem solving. As described in Chapter 7, problem solving via means–ends 
analysis requires problem solvers to process a large number of interacting elements 
and can create an extraneous cognitive load that inhibits learning. Even though some 
exposure to worked examples is used in most traditional instructional procedures, 
worked examples, to be most effective, need to be used much more systematically 
and consistently to reduce the influence of extraneous problem-solving demands.
Research into worked examples has a long history. Atkinson et  al. (2000) 
reported that as far back as the 1950s, researchers used learning-by-example strate-
gies to investigate the processes involved in concept formation. Whereas cognitive 
load theory researchers have also focused on concept or schema formation, many 
of their studies have explicitly compared worked example approaches to learning 
with a problem-solving approach. These comparisons have led to the identification 
of the worked example effect.
Worked Examples in Mathematics and Related Domains
Early evidence for the worked example effect came from studies involving the 
learning of mathematics. Sweller and Cooper (1985) used algebraic manipulation 
problems (e.g. for the equation a = af + c, express a in terms of the other variables) 
to show that worked examples required less time to process than solving the equivalent, 

101
Basic Empirical Evidence
conventional problems during acquisition, and led to quicker solutions times and 
lower error rates on similar test problems. The experimental design used in this 
study, which became a blueprint for many following studies, directly compared a 
worked example group with a conventional problem-solving group. Initially, both 
groups of high school students (Year 9) were presented a limited number of 
worked examples of the new material to be learned, in this case, solutions to alge-
bra manipulation problems. This introductory phase was followed by the main 
learning acquisition phase. For the worked example group, students were presented 
a set of problem pairs consisting of a worked example to study and then immedi-
ately after, a similar problem to solve. This example–problem pair format was 
repeated several times with different problems to form the acquisition problem set. 
The conventional group was presented the same problem set but was required to 
solve all the problems, as students were not given any worked examples to study 
during this phase. In this design, the worked example group was asked to solve half 
the number of problems that the conventional group had to solve, but was also 
asked to study worked solutions to the other half. Following acquisition, both 
groups were presented a set of test problems to solve without the inclusion of any 
worked examples.
While Sweller and Cooper (1985) found improved test performance by the 
worked example group on problems similar to the acquisition problems, they failed 
to find evidence of transfer. The worked example group did not have an advantage 
over the conventional group on dissimilar problems. In a follow up study, Cooper 
and Sweller (1987) set out to investigate the conditions under which worked examples 
could facilitate transfer. They ran a series of experiments using both algebra manip-
ulation problems and word problems to test the hypothesis that in order for transfer 
to take place, automation of problem-solving operators is necessary.
Rule or schema automation allows a procedure to be used with minimal working 
memory resources (Chapter 2). For example, we may be able to multiply out a 
denominator in a fractional algebraic equation automatically without actively think-
ing about the process. In contrast, when first learning to multiply out a denomina-
tor, we may need to consider the process every time we use it. Automation means 
working memory resources are available for other activities during problem solving. 
If we are presented with a novel problem that requires a denominator to be multi-
plied out, we can devote working memory resources to finding a solution rather 
than attempting to recall how the relevant rule works. In this manner, if worked 
examples facilitate automation more than solving the equivalent problems, transfer 
should be facilitated resulting in transfer effects.
However, automation takes place slowly and therefore requires substantial 
acquisition time, which the previous Sweller and Cooper (1985) study did not pro-
vide. In contrast, the Cooper and Sweller (1987) experiments provided extra learn-
ing time, enabling the worked example group to demonstrate significant transfer 
effects compared with the conventional group. Cooper and Sweller concluded that 
in any complex domain, significant acquisition time is required to automate the 
required problem-solving operators to demonstrate transfer. Worked examples were 
found to accelerate this process compared with a problem-solving approach.

102
8 The Worked Example and Problem Completion Effects 
A later study by Carroll (1994) found that worked examples were particularly 
helpful for students with a history of low achievement in mathematics and those 
identified as learning disabled. Pillay (1994) extended the research into the use of 
worked examples in mathematics by showing the advantage of using worked 
examples over problem solving when learning 2D and 3D mental rotations. Paas 
(1992) using statistics problems and Paas and van Merriënboer (1994) using geom-
etry problems found strong evidence for the worked example effect. Paas’ (1992) 
work will be discussed in more detail when discussing the completion effect in this 
chapter while Paas and van Merriënboer’s (1994) work will be discussed further in 
Chapter 16 when discussing the variability effect.
Worked Examples and Ill-Structured Learning Domains
The bulk of research on the worked example effect has used well-structured prob-
lems from mathematics or science domains rather than ill-structured problems 
requiring natural language, humanities or other areas related to artistic endeavours. 
A well-structured problem is one in which we can clearly specify the various prob-
lem states and the problem-solving operators (e.g. the rules of algebra) required to 
move from one state to another. Ill-structured problems do not have clearly speci-
fied problem states or problem-solving operators. ‘Discuss the meaning of this 
passage’ provides an example of an ill-structured problem.
It has been suggested by some (e.g. Spiro & DeSchryver, 2009) that the worked 
example effect cannot be obtained using ill-structured problems. In fact there are 
theoretical reasons to suppose that the cognitive activities involved in both solving 
and learning to solve ill-structured problems are identical to those required to solve 
well-structured problems (Greeno, 1976). The cognitive architecture discussed in 
the previous parts does not distinguish between well-structured and ill-structured 
problems and there is no reason to suppose we have a different architecture to 
deal these differing categories of problems. We must acquire schematically based 
knowledge that allows us to recognise problem types and the categories of solution 
moves to solve particular categories of problems irrespective of whether the prob-
lems are well structured or ill structured. The solution variations available for ill-
structured problems are larger than for well-structured problems but they are not 
infinite and experts have learned more of the possible variations than novices. Of 
course, the ultimate test is whether the worked example effect can be obtained 
using ill-structured problems.
In a review of worked examples, Renkl (2005) made a number of insightful 
comments and recommendations on future research into worked examples. One 
point made was that they could be ‘relevant only to a limited range of domains’  
(p. 241). Renkl argued that they seem to be particularly suited to skill domains where 
algorithms can be applied, i.e. well-structured problems. He commented further 
that in areas such as writing a text or interpreting a poem, the essential strength of 
worked examples in showing solution steps may not be present. As indicated above, 

103
Basic Empirical Evidence
the vast majority of the experiments described so far in this chapter have 
used algorithmic-based domains such as mathematics, science and computing. 
Nevertheless, in recent years, an increasing amount of research has been conducted 
within a cognitive load theory framework in more ill-defined domains. For example 
although not directly testing the worked example effect (there were no problem-
solving groups), Owens and Sweller (2008) demonstrated that music instruction 
could be effectively formatted using worked examples. Similarly Diao and Sweller 
(2007) and Diao, Chandler, and Sweller (2007) used worked examples in the 
domain of second language learning.
Three studies of particular note have demonstrated the worked example effect in 
ill-defined problem areas. Firstly, Rourke and Sweller (2009) required university 
students to learn to recognise particular designers’ styles from the early Modernist 
period using chair designs. It was found that a worked example approach was supe-
rior to problem solving in recognising these designs. Furthermore the worked 
example effect extended to transfer tasks in the form of other designs, based on 
stained glass windows and cutlery.
Secondly, in two experiments, Oksa, Kalyuga, and Chandler (2010) presented 
novices (Grade 10 students) with extracts from Shakespearean plays. One group 
was given explanatory notes integrated into the original text, whereas a second 
group had no such notes. Results indicated that the explanatory notes group outper-
formed the unsupported group on a comprehension task and reported a lower cogni-
tive load. The design of the Oksa et  al. experiments does not fit the traditional 
worked example alternation format of study–solve problem pairs because these 
experiments were part of a wider study on the expertise reversal effect (see Chapter 12). 
Nevertheless, half of the students were provided model answers or interpretations 
to key aspects of the text. Those model answers are equivalent to problem solutions. 
In contrast, students with no explanatory notes were required to make their own 
interpretations, an activity equivalent to problem solving. The fact that the model 
answers resulted in more learning than requiring students to make their own inter-
pretations in this very ill-structured domain provides strong evidence that the 
worked example effect is applicable to ill-structured problem domains.
Thirdly, Kyun, Kalyuga, and Sweller (in preparation) also demonstrated the 
worked example effect in learning English literature. More- and less-knowledgeable 
Korean university students for whom English was a foreign language were used in 
another study on the expertise reversal effect (Chapter 12). During the learning 
phase, half of the students were presented conventional essay questions that they 
were asked to answer. The other half of the students were presented the same ques-
tions along with model answers that they were asked to study, followed by similar 
questions that they had to answer themselves. All students then were asked to 
answer retention, near and far transfer tests. The less-knowledgeable students in the 
worked example group were rated by markers as having performed better on the 
problems of the learning phase. Even though there were no significant effects for 
transfer tests, for the retention test, the worked example group performed signifi-
cantly better than the conventional problem-solving group. Again, the worked 
example effect was demonstrated using an ill-structured problem.

104
8 The Worked Example and Problem Completion Effects 
Worked Examples in Non-Laboratory-Based Experiments
The early research into worked examples described above was conducted under 
controlled laboratory-style conditions. Evidence also emerged that a worked exam-
ples approach could be implemented effectively on a much wider scale and under 
everyday classroom conditions. In a longitudinal study with Chinese students, Zhu 
and Simon (1987) showed that worked examples could be successfully substituted 
for lectures and other traditional mathematics classroom activities over a prolonged 
period. They found that a mathematics course that was traditionally taught in  
3 years could be completed in 2 years with enhanced performance using a compre-
hensive strategy based on worked examples.
Although not as extensive as the Zhu and Simon study, other studies have also 
been conducted within realistic learning settings. For example, a critical aspect of 
the Ward and Sweller (1990) study was that students studied worked examples dur-
ing homework as part of a normal class. Carroll (1994) also administered a similar 
homework procedure. In both cases, a worked example effect was found.
Worked Examples and the Alternation Strategy
In most of the studies described above worked examples were presented in an 
example–problem pair format. During acquisition, pairs of similar problems were 
presented as the main learning vehicle. This methodology of pairing by studying 
a worked example and solving a similar problem was first adopted by Sweller and 
Cooper (1985). They created this alternation strategy on motivational grounds. It 
was assumed that students would be more motivated to study the worked example 
if they knew that they had to solve a similar problem immediately afterwards. 
Sweller and Cooper were concerned initially that students would not necessarily 
process the information in a worked example at a sufficient depth to assist schema 
acquisition if each worked example was not followed immediately by a similar 
problem to solve, and therefore created the study–solve strategy, that other 
researchers adopted.
To test the effectiveness of the alternation strategy, Trafton and Reiser (1993) 
completed a study that included blocked practice and alternating practice. Two 
types of blocked practice were included: study a set of several examples and then 
solve a similar set of problems, or solve a set of problems and then solve a set of 
similar problems. In addition, there were two types of alternating practice: Study 
an example and then immediately solve a similar problem, or solve a problem and 
immediately solve a second similar problem. Trafton and Reiser found that for an 
example to be most effective, it had to be accompanied by a problem to solve. The 
most efficient method of studying examples and solving problems was to present a 
worked example and then immediately follow this example by asking the learner 
to solve a similar problem. This efficient technique was, in fact, identical to the 
method used by Sweller and Cooper (1985) and followed in many other studies.  

105
The Problem Completion Effect
It was notable that the method of showing students a set of worked examples followed 
later by a similar set of problems to solve led to the worst learning outcomes.
The Problem Completion Effect
The worked example effect is related to several other important instructional 
effects. Some of those effects were discovered while studying the worked example 
effect. The split-attention, redundancy, modality, expertise reversal, guidance fad-
ing and variability effects will be discussed in other chapters but the problem 
completion effect will be discussed in this chapter because it is closely related to 
the worked example effect.
One early concern about the use of worked examples was that they led to passive 
rather than more active learning. Would learners attend to and study the worked 
examples in enough depth or would they simply gloss over them? Furthermore, 
evidence had emerged that students may only study worked examples in depth if 
they find difficulty in solving conventional problems (Chi, Bassok, Lewis, Reimann, 
& Glaser, 1989). These issues suggest that learners may need to know that they 
have a similar problem to solve in order to fully process the example. As previously 
discussed, the paired alternation strategy (study an example–solve a problem) was 
developed to address this issue. Another strategy to ensure learners paid sufficient 
attention to the worked examples was to provide learners with completion problems 
(van Merriënboer & Krammer 1987). A completion problem is a partial worked 
example where the learner has to complete some key solution steps. The algebra 
worked example presented at the beginning of this chapter can be converted to a 
completion problem by only demonstrating the first step and then requiring learners 
to work out the second step themselves, as the following example indicates:
Make a the subject of the equation,

Van Merriënboer (1990) conducted the first extensive study on completion problems 
within a cognitive load theory paradigm using an introductory computer- 
programming course. Over a period of ten lessons, students followed either a conven-
tional strategy in which they were asked to design and code new computer programs 
or a completion strategy that required the modification and extension of existing 
computer programs. It was found that the completion group was superior at subse-
quently constructing new programs, providing an example of the completion effect.
Van Merriënboer and de Croock (1992) also conducted a similar study with computer-
programming content. A generation (conventional) group was compared with a com-
pletion group in learning about programming techniques. Results indicated ­superior

learning by the completion group. When using a completion strategy, the presentation 
of new information and programming practice were linked to incomplete programs 
and learners were only required to complete the partial solutions, whereas the genera-
tion strategy presented both model programs and generation assignments. Although 
the model programs could be considered as worked examples, the experimental design 
was such that students did not necessarily need to study them immediately. Data indi-
cated that the conventional group frequently had to search for examples while solving 
their problems. In this learning domain, computer programs are very complex; conse-
quently asking students to generate new programs may cause a high working memory 
load, which is intensified by the need for learners to search for, and refer back to, 
equally complex model programs, thus creating a high extraneous cognitive load. 
Extraneous cognitive load is reduced by presenting learners with appropriate worked 
examples prior to problem solving so that they do not have to search for examples 
while problem solving. These two studies (van Merriënboer, 1990; van Merriënboer & 
de Croock, 1992) illustrated that worked examples that have many solution steps may 
themselves generate additional extraneous load, but it can be offset by using comple-
tion problems.
Paas (1992) expanded this research by comparing three groups (conventional 
problem solving, worked example and completion problems) in learning about 
elementary statistical concepts. Results indicated that both the worked example and 
completion groups had superior outcomes to the conventional group on both near 
and far transfer tasks, and also required less mental effort. A later study by van 
Merriënboer, Schuurman, de Croock, and Paas (2002a) found that completion prob-
lem superiority may be limited to far transfer effects, although it was also demon-
strated that a conventional condition created more cognitive load and was less 
efficient than a completion approach.
To explain the effectiveness of completion problems, Sweller (1999) argued 
that the inclusion of an element of problem solving could ensure that learners 
consider the problem in sufficient depth to attend to key information. By avoiding 
full problem solving, working memory is not overloaded. In order to complete the 
problem, the learner must attend to and process the worked-out part and then 
respond to the incomplete steps. Completion problems are a hybrid, including ele-
ments of both a worked example and a problem to be solved (Clark, Nguyen, & 
Sweller, 2006). The completion effect was the first alternative to the standard for-
mat for worked examples.
Critiques of the Use of Worked Examples
The worked example effect has been criticised with the suggestion that it only is 
obtained because of the use of an inappropriate control group (Koedinger & 
Aleven, 2007). Under problem-solving conditions testing for the worked example 
effect, students usually are asked to solve problems without any kind of support. In 
contrast, computer-based, problem-solving tutors frequently provide support when 

107
Conditions of Applicability
learners fail to solve a problem by indicating appropriate steps. In this manner, an 
equivalent of worked example steps may be presented after or during problem-
solving failure rather than prior to a problem being presented for solution. It can be 
argued that this type of supported problem solving may constitute a more appropri-
ate control group for worked examples.
It is true that most studies demonstrating the worked example effect have used 
problem-solving control groups with little or no support. Learners were simply 
required to solve problems after a limited introduction to a new topic with no 
support while solving the problem. In defence of this procedure, these conditions 
mirror common practices in educational institutions as well as being recom-
mended by problem-solving advocates. One merely has to inspect any commonly 
used textbook in mathematics or science and peruse the long lists of problems 
presented to learners with minimal numbers of worked examples to obtain an 
indication of commonly used procedures. Students are required to learn by solving 
large numbers of problems.
As it happens, even if problem solving is supported in a computer-based envi-
ronment, studying worked examples is still superior. Schwonke, Renkl, Krieg, 
Wittwer, Aleven, and Salden (2009) found that the worked example effect was still 
present in a well-supported problem-solving domain using a computer-based, cog-
nitive tutor. Studying worked examples provides one of the best, possibly the best, 
means of learning how to solve problems in a novel domain.
Other criticisms of the use of worked examples have tended to be more ideologi-
cally driven. Constructivists in particular tend to consider worked examples to be a 
form of knowledge transmission, devoid of active learning and devoid of much-
valued problem-solving experience. Of course, whether learning is active is unre-
lated to the physical activity of learners. One can be just as mentally active when 
studying a worked example as when solving a problem. It is the cognitive conse-
quences of the activity that matters. Based on the borrowing and reorganising 
principle (see Chapter 3), activity that results in the acquisition of information from 
others is a very efficient way of learning and should not be down-played. Worked 
examples reduce extraneous cognitive load and can substantially increase the effec-
tiveness of learning. As Kirschner, Sweller, and Clark (2006) pointed out, the use 
of discovery learning and problem solving during learning have a very weak 
research and theoretical base in contrast to the use of worked examples.
Conditions of Applicability
There is substantial evidence that learners, particularly those in the initial stages of 
cognitive skill acquisition, benefit more from studying worked examples than an 
equivalent episode of problem solving. Nevertheless, we need to remember that 
worked examples are effective because they reduce extraneous cognitive load. It is 
all too easy to assume that worked examples are effective because they are worked 
examples. A badly structured worked example presented to learners may be no 

108
8 The Worked Example and Problem Completion Effects 
more effective or even less effective than solving the equivalent problem. If extraneous 
cognitive load is not reduced compared to problem solving, the use of worked 
examples will not be effective.
The conditions under which worked examples are effective depend on the char-
acteristics of the material and the characteristics of the learner. All of the effects 
discussed in the following chapters are concerned with the manner in which 
instruction should be presented to particular categories of learners. Many of those 
effects apply directly to the use of worked examples as well as other forms of 
instruction. In particular, the split-attention, modality, redundancy, expertise rever-
sal, guidance fading, element interactivity, self-explanation and imagination effects 
apply to worked examples as well as other forms of instruction. The factors associ-
ated with these effects all need to be considered when constructing worked exam-
ples and will be outlined in the following chapters.
Instructional Implications
The research on the worked example effect has some very clear implications for 
instruction. Asking students to problem solve, particularly those learning new con-
cepts and procedures (novices in the domain), creates an extraneous cognitive load 
that is detrimental to learning. Instead there should be a systematic process of using 
worked examples in the sense that worked examples should be programmed to 
include the alternation strategy (or a guidance fading strategy discussed in Chapter 13) 
and consist of extensive practice prior to solving sets of problems unaided.
Critics of cognitive load theory have tended to treat worked examples as a form 
of passive learning. Studying worked examples can be passive but passivity can be 
easily avoided. The use of example–problem pairs provides a simple technique that 
avoids passive learning, as do completion problems and guidance fading. As the 
weight of research evidence has become more compelling, worked examples have 
become more prominent in education communities. For example, a recent US 
Department of Education document recommended an emphasis on worked exam-
ples (Pashler et al., 2007).
Conclusions
In over 25 years of cognitive load theory–based research the worked example effect 
has been shown to be very robust. Compelling evidence indicates that learners have 
a decided advantage in studying worked examples rather than solving equivalent 
problems.
Arguably, the worked example effect is the most important of the cognitive load 
theory effects. It has certainly been the most widely investigated. While the effect 
originated from cognitive load theory, the theory itself subsequently has been 

109
Conclusions
influenced by findings associated with the comparison of studying worked examples 
or solving problems. For example, the emphasis on the borrowing and reorganising 
principle in the current, evolutionary version of cognitive load theory relies heavily 
on the existence of the worked example effect. Furthermore, the effect can be 
difficult to explain by theories that place an emphasis on discovering or constructing 
information as opposed to obtaining that information from instructors (Kirschner, 
Sweller, & Clark, 2006).
The worked example effect has given rise to many other cognitive load theory 
effects, discussed in some of the subsequent chapters. The next chapter considers 
the split-attention effect, an effect that is critical to the effectiveness of worked 
examples.

 

111
The split-attention effect arose from the worked example effect following the discovery 
that worked examples with a particular format were relatively ineffective (Tarmizi 
& Sweller, 1988). Worked examples are valuable because they reduce extraneous 
cognitive load compared to solving the equivalent problems but, of course, it is 
unlikely that all worked examples, irrespective of their structure and function, will 
be equally effective. Indeed, some worked examples are likely to be ineffective 
because their format itself imposes a heavy extraneous cognitive load. Split-source 
worked examples fall into this category.
Split-attention occurs when learners are required to split their attention between 
at least two sources of information that have been separated either spatially or tem-
porally. Figure 9.1a provides an example. From a cognitive load theoretical per-
spective, each source of information must be essential to an understanding of the 
overall content to be learned and must be unintelligible in isolation. For maximum 
learning to occur, all disparate sources of information must be mentally integrated. 
However, by requiring learners to integrate several sources of information that are 
separated in space or time, extraneous cognitive load is created. For example, 
switching from one source of information in order to attend to another requires 
information to be maintained in working memory while searching and processing 
interacting elements in the linked source. In this manner, presenting information in 
a split-source format unnecessarily increases element interactivity resulting in an 
increase in extraneous cognitive load. Under many split-attention conditions, work-
ing memory resources are likely to be diverted away from schema formation in 
order to deal with the extraneous, interacting elements, leading to a loss of learning. 
Consequently, to prevent the learner experiencing split-attention, the different 
sources of information need to be physically integrated, or synchronised in the case 
of temporal split-attention, by the instructional designer. Figure 9.1b provides an 
example. In this fashion, considerable extraneous load can be avoided.
The split-attention effect occurs when an instructional strategy based on inte-
grated materials leads to better learning outcomes than one based on split-source 
materials. Multiple sources of information that require learners to split their attention 
in order to learn are replaced by, and experimentally compared with, a single, inte-
grated source. In general, an integrated format leads to a more effective learning

environment than a split-attention format. Much of the research into this effect has 
used multimedia materials because multimedia, by its definition, involves more than 
one information source (see Ayres & Sweller, 2005). For example, multimedia mate-
rials may include pictures or diagrams with text, or different forms of text (spoken 
or written). As noted by Sweller (1999), ‘cognitive load theory does not distinguish 
between text and diagrams, text and text, or diagrams and diagrams as contributors 
to a split-attention effect’ (p. 98). In the case of a diagram and written text (two 
sources of information), integration can be achieved by embedding the written text 
within the diagram. In the case of a diagram and spoken text, the narrative should be 
temporally aligned with the diagram. In both situations, integration is achieved.
The split-attention effect closely accords with human cognitive architecture. 
Providing information to learners uses the borrowing and reorganising principle 
to increase information in long-term memory (the information store). If that 
information is presented in split-source form, learners must search for referents. 
Fig. 9.1  (a) Split-attention format of a geometry worked example. (b) Integrated format of a 
geometry worked example

113
Various Categories of the Split-Attention Effect
Search always involves the randomness as genesis principle and imposes a working 
memory load due to the narrow limits of change principle. That search can be 
reduced by physically integrating multiple sources of information, reducing unnec-
essary interacting elements and so reducing extraneous cognitive load. The increased 
information stored in long-term memory then can be used to solve subsequent prob-
lems according to the environmental organising and linking principle.
The following two worked examples (see Fig. 9.1) illustrate the materials that 
can be used to demonstrate the split-attention effect. Figure 9.1a shows a worked 
example of the solution to an elementary geometry problem presented in a split-
source form. Angle HGD is given as 120° and the problem solver is required to find 
angle EFB. Although there are several, alternative, possible solution paths, the 
worked example provides a two-step solution written below the diagram. As a first 
step, angle GFB is found using the ‘corresponding angle between parallel lines 
theorem’ (120°). Secondly, angle EFB (the goal angle) is found using the ‘angles 
along a straight-line theorem’ (60°). This example is categorised as using a split-
source format because the solution is presented below rather than within the dia-
gram, and neither the diagram nor the text can be understood in isolation as a 
solution to the problem. The worked solution requires the learner to read each state-
ment and then examine the diagram to determine the correspondence between the 
lines and angles referred to in the statement and the diagram. This process of coor-
dinating the statements with the diagram requires a search of the diagram to find 
relevant lines and angles. To conduct that search, both sources of information, the 
diagram and the statements, may need to be re-visited on several occasions with 
information from both retained in working memory. These mental processes 
increase the load on working memory resulting in an extraneous cognitive load due 
to the format of the information.
In contrast to the conventional, split-source format of a worked example in 
Fig.  9.1a, the integrated worked example, shown in Fig.  9.1b, requires reduced 
search for referents and reduced temporary storage of information because each 
solution step is embedded at an appropriate location within the diagram. Each solu-
tion step is positioned in close proximity to the relevant angles and lines referred to 
by the statement. The steps are numbered to make it easy for the learner to follow 
the correct sequence. In this physically integrated format, extraneous cognitive load 
can be significantly reduced compared to the split-attention format of Fig. 9.1a. It can 
be hypothesised that learners studying the integrated format of Fig. 9.1b will learn 
more than learners studying the split-attention format of Fig. 9.1a, demonstrating 
the split-attention effect.
Various Categories of the Split-Attention Effect
The split-attention effect has been obtained in a wide variety of circumstances using 
many different types of materials studied by many different categories of learners. 
Nevertheless, there is a set of requirements common to all circumstances in which 

114
9 The Split-Attention Effect
split-attention occurs. The most important of these is that the multiple sources of 
information must be unintelligible and unlearnable in isolation. If, for example, a 
diagram provides all of the information needed to learn, integrating any additional 
text into the diagram will not be beneficial. Under these circumstances, the text 
should be eliminated, not integrated (see Chapter 11 on the redundancy effect). The 
split-attention effect only occurs when the two or more sources of information must 
be processed together in order to understand the information being presented. With 
that proviso, there are many different forms of the split-attention effect.
Worked Examples and the Split-Attention Effect
The initial research into many cognitive load effects was conducted using learning 
materials from mathematics and the sciences. The split-attention effect was no 
exception. The initial research was conducted by Tarmizi and Sweller (1988), who 
originally aimed to extend the findings of the worked example effect (see Chapter 8) 
to geometry materials, as at that time, the effect had only been demonstrated using 
algebra content (Cooper & Sweller, 1987; Sweller & Cooper, 1985). Initially, 
Tarmizi and Sweller found that neither worked examples nor guided solutions (par-
tial worked examples) in geometry were any better than conventional problem-
solving strategies. Tarmizi and Sweller reasoned that the split-attention format 
conventionally used in geometry and seen in Fig. 9.1a could explain the failure of 
geometry worked examples. The worked examples used had adopted the common 
presentation format found in mathematics textbooks with the written solution steps 
below the diagram. Tarmizi and Sweller then successfully tested an integrated 
approach similar to that depicted in Fig. 9.1b, demonstrating that studying worked 
examples was superior to conventional problem solving, provided diagrams and 
solution steps were physically integrated.
Following the success of the physical integration procedure in geometry, the 
split-attention effect was also found with coordinate geometry worked examples 
(Sweller, Chandler, Tierney, & Cooper, 1990). Although closely related to theorem-
driven geometry, coordinate geometry has a greater reliance on formulae. However, 
historically, worked examples in this domain also separate the written text and 
formulae from the relevant diagrams. The study of Sweller et al. (1990) showed that 
worked examples had no advantage over conventional problem solving when they 
were constructed in a split-source presentation format, but had a significant advan-
tage if they were structured according to an integrated approach.
Ward and Sweller (1990) demonstrated the split-attention effect when teaching 
students how to solve kinematics problems. In this highly mathematical domain 
based on formula manipulation, no worked example effect was found if problem 
solutions were presented in a traditional textbook format. Although diagrams are 
not necessarily involved in such problems, several different formulae are usually 
separated spatially both from each other and more importantly, from the problem 
statement. In these types of problems, a number of numerical values for velocity, 

115
Various Categories of the Split-Attention Effect
distance and acceleration indicated in the problem statement have to be substituted 
into appropriate equations. In a conventional kinematics worked example, the prob-
lem statement containing the values for variables, and the equations into which the 
values must be substituted, are separated, resulting in split-attention between the 
problem statement and the equations used in the solution. Figure 9.2a provides an 
example.
As can be seen in Fig. 9.2a, in order to understand the substitutions of values 
into the formula, the problem statement either needs to have been memorised, a 
difficult task, or it needs to be constantly referred to while considering the equa-
tions with substituted values. Having to refer to both an equation and a physically 
separated problem statement in order to understand a worked example provides a 
classic example of a split-attention situation.
The approach taken in Fig. 9.2b integrates the equation into the problem state-
ment. The substitution of values is made exactly when the terms are first indicated, 
and even before the entire problem statement is presented. Learners do not have to 
search for relations between the equations and the problem statement because those 
relations are made explicit in the physically integrated worked example. Working 
memory resources are not wasted in searching for appropriate referents in the prob-
lem statement or the equations because the referential connections are made 
explicit in the example.
By adopting this strategy, Ward and Sweller were able to demonstrate not only 
a worked example effect but also a split-attention effect. They compared three 
approaches: a conventional problem-solving strategy, a split-attention worked 
example strategy and an integrated worked example strategy. Test results indicated 
superior performance for the integrated worked example group compared with the 
other two groups that did not differ.

9 The Split-Attention Effect
The studies described above were conducted with worked examples demonstrating 
procedural mathematical steps. As can be seen, a wide variety of worked examples 
from diagrammatic Euclidean geometry to formulae-based areas such as kinematics 
may require re-formatting in order to eliminate split-attention. However, many 
instructional techniques include explanatory text (spoken or written) combined 
with diagrams, other sources of text or even text associated with actual hardware as 
occurs when manuals are used to provide information about operating machines. 
All of these materials tend to be presented using split-attention formats with or 
without the inclusion of worked examples. These versions of the split-attention 
effect will be discussed in the following sections.
Diagrams and Written Explanations
The first study to examine the effectiveness of explanatory notes within a split-
attention context was conducted by Sweller et al. (1990). In addition to their previ-
ously described results demonstrating the importance of reducing split-attention in 
coordinate geometry worked examples, they also found that the most effective for-
mat used to provide explanations during initial instruction was to integrate explana-
tory notes into a diagram at the closest point of reference. An example of this 
format is shown in Fig. 9.3.
Instead of writing explanatory notes below the diagram, the notes can be labelled 
and embedded into the diagram, as can be seen in Fig. 9.3. In this example, where the 
learners are required to plot a point on the x–y axis, the explanation is positioned along-
side the actual point. Accordingly, there is only a limited amount of problem-solving 
Fig. 9.3  Example of integrated explanatory text in coordinate geometry

Various Categories of the Split-Attention Effect
search for referents required as the learner’s attention is focused on the relevant 
mathematics rather than on attempting to mentally integrate the text and diagram. 
Physical integration provides a substitute for mental integration that is kept to a 
minimum by the integrated format. Instead, more working memory resources can 
be concentrated on schema acquisition that is germane to learning rather than 
dealing with unnecessary search and integration processes that are extraneous to 
learning.
Sweller et al. (1990) tested the relative effectiveness of the format demonstrated 
in Fig. 9.3 in which explanatory notes were fully integrated into the diagram. In one 
experiment, they demonstrated that physically integrated explanatory notes were 
more effective than writing the notes below the diagram in a split-source format.  
A second experiment combined initial, integrated explanatory notes (first phase) 
with integrated worked examples (second phase) and compared them with a strat-
egy that provided split-source notes (first phase) and split-source worked examples 
(second phase). Again, the integrated format proved superior to the split-source 
format. In this experiment, group differences were consistently large, with the inte-
grated format requiring less time to study the initial explanations (first phase), less 
time to study the worked examples (second phase) and less time to complete the 
test problems. Despite the reduced time on task, a clear advantage for physically 
integrated formats was found on both similar test problems and a transfer problem.
Sweller et  al. (1990) extended their experiments to include the domain of 
numerical control programming. In learning these tasks, students were required to 
write programs to control industrial machinery. There is a connection to coordinate 
geometry, as control of the movement of machines such as lathes is dependent upon 
the Cartesian coordinate system. Nevertheless, compared with elementary coordi-
nate geometry, such programming tasks are much higher in element interactivity. In 
this experiment, conducted with trade apprentices, an integrated group again out-
performed a split-attention group on test problems and required far less time during 
acquisition. It is notable that the explanatory notes in this study were extensive, 
requiring multiple procedural steps.
Purnell, Solman, and Sweller (1991) found a split-attention effect in geography, 
a domain heavily dependent upon diagrams and tables that are usually linked with 
explanatory text. In a series of four experiments, students were required to read 
maps either in an integrated or a split-source format in which descriptions were 
placed below the map. Results indicated that the integrated approach led to superior 
recall of the items detailed on the map but also led to superior inferences being 
made about these items. Chandler and Sweller (1991), using electrical apprentices 
learning about the installation of electrical wiring, also successfully demonstrated 
the split-attention effect. Integrating diagrams of electrical circuits with explanatory 
text proved superior to a conventional format that separated diagrams and text.
Mayer (1989) found that students learning about hydraulic braking systems were 
disadvantaged if the explanatory text was placed below an illustration of the sys-
tem. However, an integrated approach where the words were positioned next to the 
part of the picture to which the text referred, resulted in much better transfer test 
outcomes. In further work, Mayer, Steinhoff, Bower, and Mars (1995) conducted  

118
9 The Split-Attention Effect
a series of experiments in which students learned how lightning works. Students in 
an integrated strategy group received a booklet where each illustration was posi-
tioned next to a paragraph of explanatory text. In addition, each illustration had a 
caption that contained keywords from the relevant paragraph of text. In contrast, 
students in a split-attention strategy group received a booklet where the explanatory 
text appeared on a separate page to the illustrations with no captions. Students in 
three different experiments performed better on transfer tasks if they received the 
integrated booklets. Moreno and Mayer (1999) collected further evidence using 
computer-based animations to teach students about lightning formations. In this 
experiment, they demonstrated the split-attention effect without radically separating 
units of information onto different pages as Mayer et al. (1995) had done. For the 
separated group, the on-screen text was placed at the bottom of the screen beneath 
the corresponding diagram, while the integrated group’s text was placed near the 
relevant section of the diagram. Again, students in the integrated group performed 
best on transfer tasks. In a later study Austin (2009) replicated these results.
Later studies have extended research into the split-attention effect to other learn-
ing domains. Rose and Wolfe (2000) found the effect with undergraduate accoun-
tancy students. Using two sources of information, a decision aid for calculating tax 
liabilities and instructions on calculating tax, an integrated format was found to be 
more effective than dual screens (each source on a separate screen) or a split-screen 
(same screen but physically separated sources). In a similar study Rose (2002) 
replicated these results. Ayres and Youssef (2008) found the split-attention effect 
using economics materials. In this study, undergraduate students were required to 
learn about the supply and demand curve. The effect was greatest on questions that 
required diagrammatic knowledge.
Pociask and Morrison (2008) found the effect in teaching complex orthopaedic 
physical therapy skills in a realistic classroom setting. In this study, novice physical 
therapy students were shown a number of procedures for localising various forms 
of patient pain. Test results suggested that the integrated format led to superior 
learning as measured by written and psychomotor tasks as well as physical therapy 
performance, with reduced cognitive load. However, it should be noted that this 
study included redundant material making it difficult to interpret the precise cause 
of the effect. Studies by Cierniak, Scheiter, and Gerjets (2009a, 2009b), used very 
detailed instructions to explain the structure and physiological processes involved 
in the human kidneys. Text for both split-attention and integrated modes were very 
dense. A split-attention effect was found, indicating again (see also Sweller et al., 
1990) that the effect could be found when the computer screen was filled with many 
lines of explanatory text related to diagrams.
These experiments conclusively demonstrated the advantages of placing essential 
information needed to understand a diagram on the diagram itself. For diagrams 
and text that cannot be understood in isolation, extraneous cognitive load is 
increased if learners must search for connections between the two sources of infor-
mation due to a split-source presentation. That search process with its heavy working 
memory demands can be largely eliminated by integrating text into a diagram.

119
Various Categories of the Split-Attention Effect
Multiple Sources of Text
As well as integrating diagrams and explanatory notes, Sweller et al. (1990) also 
investigated the integration of two sources of text. Using Numerical Control (NC) 
Programming, they integrated two sources of explanatory information. One set of 
instructions concerned the physical movements of a machine that was required to 
cut a metal sheet in a particular way and the second set concerned the numerical 
control statements that would program the machine to accomplish the requisite 
operations. For example:
	1.	 The first manual instruction stated: To commence cutting, move along the car-
riage towards the head-stock for 16 mm.
	2.	 The corresponding NC instruction read: A straight line cut is to be made: The 
NC command for a straight line cut is G01.
These two categories of instruction, both of which must be understood if stu-
dents are to learn numerical control programming, normally are placed in two sepa-
rate tables presented simultaneously or successively. Physical integration was 
achieved by providing a single manual instruction, immediately followed by the 
relevant NC instruction in parentheses:
To commence cutting, move along the carriage towards the head-stock for 16 mm. 
(A straight line cut is to be made: The NC command for a straight line cut is G01.)
In this fashion, a single set of instructions was created integrating both sources 
of information. In this experiment, one group of students were instructed using the 
integrated approach, and compared with a second group that received two separate 
sets of instructions presented successively. Results indicated that the integrated 
group required less time to study the information and obtained higher scores on 
subsequent test results. As was the case for diagrams and text, the result was attrib-
uted to a reduction in extraneous cognitive load due to a reduced need to search for 
correspondences and referents.
More Than Two Sources of Information
Chung (2007) investigated split-attention in the domain of learning Chinese as a 
second language using three different sources of information. Chung simultane-
ously presented three flash cards to learners consisting of a Chinese character, the 
English translation and the pinyin (a phonic transcription system) equivalent. Not 
only was the order of the three cards manipulated, but also the physical distance 
between them. It was found that superior learning and pronunciation was obtained 
when the English or pinyin card was presented close to the Chinese character, rather 
than spatially apart, indicating a split-attention effect.

120
9 The Split-Attention Effect
Lee and Kalyuga (2011b) also investigated the effectiveness of pinyin in learning 
Chinese as a second language from the perspective of cognitive load theory. They 
suggested that when learning vocabulary, the commonly used horizontal layout 
format for presenting pinyin could impose high levels of cognitive load and hinder 
learning of characters due to split-attention caused by learners searching and 
matching corresponding characters and pinyin. In an alternative vertical format, 
pinyin is placed exactly under the corresponding characters, thus reducing potential 
split-attention. Figure 9.4 depicts the two formats. In an experiment involving high 
school students learning Chinese as a second language, the learning effects of the 
vertical and horizontal layouts of characters, pinyin and English translations were 
compared. Results indicated a significant advantage of the vertical format that was 
attributed to the elimination of split-attention.
Split-Attention While Learning to Use a Computer
One of the most common examples of split-attention occurs when instructing learn-
ers how to use hardware. An example is learning how to use a computer by follow-
ing instructions either from a computer manual or more commonly these days, from 
a computer screen. Learners are required to read the information and learn how to 
manipulate various parts of the computer, such as the mouse, or type in specific 
commands to run a particular application. Almost invariably, learners’ attention 
will be split between the hardware and the text in a classical split-attention 
scenario.
Sweller and Chandler (1994) and Chandler and Sweller (1996) demonstrated 
this phenomenon with learners required to learn about a CAD/CAM (computer 
aided design/computer aided manufacture) package either using a conventional 
split-source procedure (computer and manual in this particular case) or an inte-
grated strategy that used only a modified manual. In the integrated strategy, text and 
diagrams were presented in physically integrated form in the manual, but learners 
were not permitted access to a computer, as all commands concerning the keyboard

and computer screen were depicted in the manual. In contrast, learners in the 
split-source condition could try out various procedures on a computer while reading 
the manual. On subsequent tests of knowledge and tests of ability to use the appli-
cations that had been taught, the integrated method produced superior results indi-
cating a split-attention effect. Surprisingly, students in the integrated group who 
had not used a computer during learning were able to demonstrate superior compe-
tence in using a computer to solve the primary tasks than students who had prac-
tised with the actual physical equipment.
These studies showed that instructions on how to use computer programs could 
be learned quite effectively by presenting all instructions in a single, integrated 
module without, in the first instance, presenting learners with a computer on which 
to practice. A follow-up study by Cerpa, Chandler, and Sweller (1996) showed that 
it made no difference whether the instructions were presented on a screen or in a 
paper-based manual. Using spreadsheets as the learning domain, students were 
required to learn how to create some elementary mathematical formulae within 
cells. An integrated format was achieved by inserting all instructions into the 
spreadsheets at the most spatially relevant points, within the cells themselves. This 
strategy was compared with a split-source format in which the screen-based 
instructions were not integrated with the spreadsheet. Again, the physically inte-
grated instructions were superior demonstrating the split-attention effect.
A notable finding of Sweller and Chandler (1994), Chandler and Sweller (1996) 
and Cerpa et al. (1996) was that the split-attention effect only occurred using mate-
rials high in element interactivity. For example, in learning about spreadsheets, 
tasks such as locating a cell or simply typing in a value are low in elementary inter-
activity, as they can be processed sequentially with very few interacting elements. 
In contrast, tasks such as devising quite complicated mathematical formulae are 
high in elementary interactivity. Not only do students need to know what the 
formula is, but also which symbols on the keyboard represent the mathematical 
symbols, how these are put together in the correct cell, and what cell markers are 
used in the formula. The split-attention effect was only obtained with such high 
element interactivity materials. The impact of element interactivity is discussed in 
more detail in Chapter 15.
The results in this section indicate that instructions in how to use machinery 
need to be carefully considered. We all know that frequently, we would much prefer 
to try to use machinery without even reading the instructions. That may, in fact, be 
an effective strategy under many circumstances. Split-attention, both within the 
instructions and in the present context, between the instructions and the machinery 
generate such a heavy working memory load that learners feel the need to dispense 
with either the instructions or the machine. Since the instructions tend to be unintel-
ligible without the machine, we jettison the instructions. We now know how to 
present instructions in a manner that does not inflict an extraneous cognitive load. 
Properly structured instructions that can be fully understood, without reference to 
the machinery, can be much more intelligible than instructions that split attention 
between the instructional material and the machinery.

9 The Split-Attention Effect
Split-Attention and Other Cognitive Load Theory Effects
Several studies have considered relations between the split-attention effect and 
other effects. When investigating the use of self-explanations with worked exam-
ples, Mwangi and Sweller (1998) included instruction presented in split-source or 
integrated formats. They studied very young students solving mathematics prob-
lems. A notable finding was that an integrated format led to more inference making 
while self-explaining than a split-source format. In addition, while self-explaining, 
the integrated group made more solution-oriented re-reads of the materials com-
pared to the split-attention group.
These results can be explained in terms of an increase in working memory load 
associated with split-attention instructions. Inferencing is likely to impose a heavy 
working memory burden. Instructions presented in split-source format may leave 
insufficient working memory resources to allow inferences to be made. The reduction 
in load imposed by integrated instructions may permit inferencing. Similarly, the 
reduction in extraneous load associated with integrated instructions may permit solu-
tion-oriented re-reading of material that might be difficult under split-attention 
conditions. If learners are using working memory resources to integrate disparate 
sources of information, they may have few resources available to consider the solution.
Yeung, Jin, and Sweller (1998) investigated the use of explanatory notes in read-
ing comprehension and demonstrated how sensitive the split-attention effect is to the 
prior knowledge of the learner. In this study, integration was achieved by placing the 
explanatory notes above the relevant sections in the text, whereas in the split-source 
format, the notes were placed together at the end of the text. In a series of experi-
ments it was found that the integrated format enhanced comprehension, on a diffi-
cult, high element interactivity task, for primary students and low-ability learners of 
English as a second language, but did not enhance vocabulary acquisition, on a rela-
tively easy, low element interactivity task. For vocabulary, the explanatory notes 
were redundant and could be more easily ignored when placed at the end of the text. 
Reducing split-attention mattered for complex, high element interactivity tasks but 
not for simpler, low element interactivity tasks. However, these results reversed for 
more experienced, adult learners providing an example of the expertise reversal 
effect. Kalyuga, Chandler, and Sweller (1998) obtained similar findings in the tech-
nical domain of learning about electrical circuits. These studies demonstrated the 
relation of the split-attention effect to both the redundancy and expertise reversal 
effects, discussed more fully in Chapters 11 and 12, respectively.
Temporal Split-Attention
To this point, we have discussed spatial split-attention in which learners must 
handle information that is spatially separated, and so needs to be mentally inte-
grated in order to be understood. Improved learning following physical integration 

123
Temporal Split-Attention
results in the split-attention effect. Spatial split-attention is not the only form of 
split-attention. The effect can be temporal as well as spatial. If multiple sources of 
information that need to be integrated are presented at separate times rather than 
separate locations, we might expect a split-attention effect identical to the one 
obtained using spatial split-attention.
Work on the temporal split-attention effect can be closely related to work on 
spatial split-attention. With temporal separation (displacement in time), learners 
must find referents between the separated sources of information. Finding referents 
involves search, in the same way that spatially separated information must be 
searched for referents. In addition, learners must integrate the different sources of 
information after searching before they can be understood. Consequently, extrane-
ous cognitive load is generated in much the same way as in physically separated 
materials. In summary, temporally separated learning materials can generate sig-
nificant extraneous load. To alleviate this load, the verbal and visual sources of 
information should be presented simultaneously in temporally integrated form (for 
an overview see Mayer, 2009)
There is considerable empirical support for Mayer’s temporal split-attention 
principle. Initial evidence came from the research of Baggett (1984), who con-
ducted an experiment in which students were shown different versions of an 
instructional film. Either the narrative was presented before the corresponding 
visual information (7, 14 or 21 s before) or after it (7, 14 or 21 s after). Another 
version that can be considered analogous to physical integration presented the 
visual and auditory information simultaneously. On recall tests, the simultaneous 
presentation and the version in which the visual information was presented 7 s 
before the narrative outperformed the other groups, demonstrating the temporal 
split-attention effect.
Mayer and Anderson (1991, 1992) collected further evidence of the temporal 
split-attention through two studies presenting information via narrated animations 
on how a bicycle pump worked. The first study compared a group presented with 
the complete narrative before the animation with an integrated group in which the 
narrative and animation were presented concurrently. Test results using problem-
solving tasks indicated that the integrated group performed significantly better than 
the split-attention group. In the second study, Mayer and Anderson (1992) increased 
the number of presentations by using repetitions of narrative and visual animations. 
Animations were presented before as well as after narration. Groups that received 
temporally displaced sequences were compared with a group that received inte-
grated sequences. Results indicated that the integrated group was superior to the 
split-attention formats on problem-solving tasks.
Mayer and Anderson made some interesting additional observations. Firstly, the 
results were achieved with novices in the domain and may not have been achieved 
with students who had higher levels of prior knowledge. Secondly, the content 
focused on mechanical systems that show how something works, and the results 
may not transfer to more descriptive passages relying on the recall of facts. Thirdly, 
the effect was only found on problem-solving transfer tasks and not on retention 
tasks. The hypotheses that flow from these observations are plausible but have not 

124
9 The Split-Attention Effect
yet been tested. Mayer, Moreno, Boire, and Vagge (1999), Mayer and Sims (1994) 
and Moreno and Mayer (1999) confirmed the temporal split-attention effect. Mayer 
et al. (1999) investigated the influence of the length of the narrations and anima-
tions. If narrations and animations were significantly reduced in length (called 
small bites), no difference was found between integrated and separated formats. 
However, if the sizes of the animations and narrations were much larger (large 
bites) then an integrated format was superior. Mayer et al. explained this effect in 
terms of working memory load. Holding large sections of narrative in working 
memory at any time can easily overload it and so it may be important to reduce 
cognitive load by eliminating temporal split-attention. Maintaining much smaller 
bites should be more manageable and so it may not be as important to reduce cogni-
tive load by eliminating split-attention.
Owens and Sweller (2008) extended the findings on temporal split-attention to 
include music education. In two experiments, the effect was demonstrated in both 
spatial (visual musical notation positioned above written explanations) and tempo-
ral displacements (visual musical notation shown after verbal explanations).
Alternative Methods to Overcome Split-Attention
The studies reported so far have all used an integration strategy to compensate for 
the problems associated with split-source presentations of information. A number 
of alternative methods have also been investigated.
Directing Attention and the Split-Attention Effect
Kalyuga, Chandler, and Sweller (1999) developed an alternative strategy to physi-
cal integration based on helping the learner by directing attention to appropriate 
sources of information. In an experiment that required apprentices to learn about 
electrical circuits, a colour coding system was used to connect the text directly with 
the relevant parts of the diagram. Attention was directed appropriately by the 
learner clicking on the particular paragraph of text being studied that triggered the 
corresponding parts of the electrical circuit to change to a unique, identifiable 
colour, thus reducing the amount of visual search required. This strategy when 
compared with a split-source format, where the text was written below the diagram, 
showed superior learning outcomes and efficiency. Reducing visual search by cuing 
was also found to be an effective strategy by Tabbers, Martens, and van Merriënboer 
(2000). In this study, visual cueing was achieved by colouring red those parts of the 
diagram to which the text, either spoken or written, referred. However, Tabbers 
et al. (2000) only found an effect for tests of recall and not transfer.
Florax and Ploetzner (2010) also provided more explicit links to the different 
sources of information by combining segmentation and signalling techniques.  

125
Alternative Methods to Overcome Split-Attention
It was found that if substantial explanatory text was divided into smaller segments 
and each segment labelled with a number corresponding to an equivalent number 
on the accompanying diagram, then no difference in learning was found when 
compared with a fully integrated group, where the text segments were inserted into 
the corresponding diagrams. In contrast, both strategies were superior to a format 
that had unsegmented text displaced from the relevant diagram. A further finding 
from this study was that segmentation had a stronger effect than labelling. This 
study can be explained from a cognitive load theory perspective in that smaller 
chunks of information are easier to hold in working memory, facilitating mental 
integration from the two sources. In addition, labelling the segments and points on 
the diagram reduces search processes and so further reduces cognitive load. This 
combination may reduce cognitive load sufficiently to overcome the negative 
impact of split-attention. The findings in this study provide some support for previ-
ous studies by Mayer and colleagues (Mayer et al., 1999; Moreno & Mayer, 1999), 
who found that smaller segments alone could eliminate the split-attention effect.
The Pop-Up Alternative to Text Integration
As indicated above, the most common form of text–picture integration is to place 
the text into the diagram closest to the relevant referents. Some researchers have used 
a text hyper-linking procedure as an alternative, giving more control to the learner. 
Bétrancourt and Bisseret (1998) noted that presentations could become very 
cluttered if large amounts of text are inserted into a picture. To avoid such over-
crowding, they designed an alternative presentation format where the text was 
inserted into the diagram at the relevant position but hidden from sight unless acti-
vated by the learner by clicking on the mouse. This ‘pop-up’ procedure was com-
pared with a split-source format (text to the right of the diagram) and traditional 
integration (text embedded into the diagram). Results indicated that both forms of 
integrated material generally led to superior learning outcomes compared with a 
split-source presentation. Although not statistically significant, the pop-up display 
led to quicker solution times and reduced error rates than the traditional integrated 
format. It should also be pointed out that user-control adds a further dimension to 
the study (the pop-up procedure gave more control to the users than an integration 
procedure), which may interact with the split-attention effect.
Further evidence supporting the effectiveness of a pop-up method was found by 
Erhel and Jamet (2006). In a similar design to Bétrancourt and Bisseret (1998),  
a pop-up procedure was compared with integrated and separated formats. On a 
number of learning measures the pop-up and integrated procedures were found to 
be superior to the separated format, demonstrating a split-attention effect. However, 
on tasks that measured inferences and matching text with illustrated materials, the 
pop-up procedure was superior to the integrated format.
Crooks, White, Srinivasan, and Wang (2008) also used the pop-up design in a 
study, which used modified definitions of the split-attention principle with respect 

126
9 The Split-Attention Effect
to interactive geography maps. It was argued that in a situation where a learner 
selects features on a map, and supporting text appears almost immediately, the time 
difference is so slight that no temporal separation is realistically experienced. Using 
a pop-up strategy, Crooks et al. (2008) showed that the text could be positioned 
away from the map and still remain effective. It was shown that the text, having 
been activated by the mouse click on a specific map label, could appear on a sepa-
rate screen, and still facilitate more learning than a presentation format that relied 
on two screens with constant split-attention. Even though the pop-up format created 
split-attention in the same way as conventional spatially split designs, the linking 
between the map label and explanatory text counteracted this negativity. The 
authors argued that spatial split-attention does not impact on learning over and 
above temporal split-attention. However, this conclusion must be treated with some 
caution, as the linking of labels on the diagram with explanations may be consid-
ered as a form of cuing strategy, as well as reflect the impact of user interactivity.
Procedural Information and the Split-Attention Effect
Kester, Kirschner, and van Merriënboer (2005) investigated the specific use of pro-
cedural information in a computer-simulated environment where high school students 
were required to solve electrical circuit problems. An integrated and split-source 
format was compared using a combination of supportive and procedural informa-
tion. Using a just-in-time strategy (see Kester, Kirschner, van Merriënboer, & 
Bäumer, 2001), vital supportive information in the form of explanations about elec-
trical circuits was provided to students before solving problems. In addition, essential 
procedural information was also provided during practice, enabling students to 
learn about components in the circuits and what actions they need to carry out. In 
the split-source format, the procedural information was separated from the diagram 
of the circuit, whereas in the integrated format, the procedural information was 
embedded within the diagram. Results indicated that the integrated group spent less 
time than the split-source group studying supportive information and scored higher 
on transfer tasks.
Learner Integration of Split-Source Materials
Bodemer, Ploetzner, Feuerlein, and Spada (2004) investigated the consequences of 
learners rather than instructors eliminating split-attention. Using materials that 
described how a bicycle pump works, a split-source format was designed by pre-
senting the written text above the diagrams, whereas for the integrated condition, 
the text was embedded within the diagrams, as is normally found in two-group, 
split-attention experiments. However, a further two groups were formed by adding 
another condition to the split-source and integrated formats. Learners were required 

127
Conditions of Applicability
to physically build the materials themselves by placing the various explanatory 
notes onto an integrated or split-format diagram using interactive commands on the 
computer. The materials were presented in a split-attention format initially so in the 
case of the split-source format diagram, learners had to move the written compo-
nents from one split-source location to another split-source location. In the case of 
the integrated diagram, they had to move components from the original split-source 
location to an integrated location. Thus, instead of just mentally integrating sources 
of information (either in integrated or split-source format) as learners did under the 
normal conditions, this design required learners to both physically and mentally 
integrate the two sources as well.
Results indicated that the integrated format was superior to the split-source for-
mat on understanding test tasks, and a trend suggested that a combination of mental 
and physical integration was superior to just mental integration alone. A second 
experiment, within a more complex domain, demonstrated that a joint physical and 
mental integration approach led to better learning outcomes than strategies that 
required mental integration only (both split and integrated formats). This experi-
ment showed that learner interactivity in constructing the integrated diagram rather 
than just being presented one had a positive effect. Nevertheless, in this experiment, 
unlike the first experiment, no regular split-attention effect was found for groups 
that did not physically integrate the materials.
A Meta-Analysis of the Split-Attention Effect
Ginns (2006) completed a meta-analysis of the split-attention effect. Fifty studies 
were included, of which 37 involved spatial split-attention and 13 temporal. The 
overall effect size had a Cohen’s d value of 0.85, which is a large effect (Cohen, 
1988). No significant difference was found between spatial split-attention (d = 0.72) 
and temporal split-attention (d = 0.78). As would be expected, the effect was weak 
for low element interactivity materials (d = 0.28) and significantly greater for materi-
als with higher levels of element interactivity (d = 0.78). Consistently high effect sizes 
were found across mathematics, science and technical learning domains, similar and 
transfer tests, various age groups, as well as static and dynamic presentations. This 
meta-analysis demonstrated that the split-attention effect is robust and occurs across 
different learning domains and types of instructional designs. Learning from inte-
grated materials has a large advantage over learning from split-source materials.
Conditions of Applicability
The split-attention effect occurs when a learning strategy that physically integrates 
different sources is shown to be more effective than a strategy that keeps the materi-
als separate. An overriding condition for the effect to occur is that each source of 

128
9 The Split-Attention Effect
information is essential and non-redundant. For example, if students are able to learn 
from one source alone, then there is no need to physically integrate information. The 
research reported above demonstrates that the split-attention effect can be based on 
both spatial and temporal factors. The effect occurs across many learning domains 
and under various combinations of text (both written and spoken), pictures, dia-
grams, graphs and machinery such as computers, but is more likely to occur with 
learning material that is high in intrinsic element interactivity (see Chapter 15).
Instructional Implications
Research on the split-attention effect provides a clear message for instructional 
designers: Different sources of information that must be considered simultaneously 
for understanding and learning to occur should be integrated as far as possible. As 
has been demonstrated in this chapter, requiring learners to mentally integrate dif-
ferent sources of information that are separated in space or time is detrimental to 
learning. If written text is used, it must be positioned next to its referents, or in the 
case of spoken text, it must be synchronised with the visual representation. Without 
such integrated alignments, learning is likely to be inhibited.
Conclusions
The split-attention effect is important for several reasons. First, it provides us with 
an important instructional design principle that is frequently ignored. Information 
that needs to be considered simultaneously, in order to be understood needs to be 
presented in a manner that eliminates spatial or temporal separation. Secondly, the 
split-attention effect indicates why the worked example effect sometimes fails. 
Simply presenting worked examples does not guarantee a reduction in extraneous 
cognitive load. Worked examples must be deliberately structured to ensure that they 
do not themselves impose a heavy extraneous cognitive load. Thirdly, the split-
attention effect flows directly from cognitive load theory. Holding information in 
working memory, while searching for referents, imposes a heavy extraneous cogni-
tive load that should be reduced.
For these reasons, the split-attention effect is one of the most important cognitive 
load effects. Indeed, its importance transcends these points because of its wider 
implications, especially its implications for other cognitive load effects. The modality 
effect, discussed in the next chapter, also relies on the split-attention effect.

129
The modality effect is closely related to the split-attention effect (Chapter 9). 
According to cognitive load theory, the split-attention effect occurs when learners 
must process separate but related sources of information that cannot be understood 
without mental integration. The cognitive resources required to effect this integra-
tion are unavailable for learning and may exceed the available capacity of working 
memory. This chapter describes an alternative way of dealing with split-attention 
conditions by engaging both auditory and visual channels of information in work-
ing memory rather than just the visual channel. For example, rather than presenting 
a diagram and written text that rely entirely on the visual channel, a diagram and 
spoken text relying on both auditory and visual modalities are used.
We need to emphasise that as was the case with the split-attention effect, the 
modality effect only is obtainable when the two sources of information are unintel-
ligible in isolation. Textual information presented in spoken form will not generate 
a modality effect if it merely re-describes a diagram or some other form of informa-
tion. If a diagram and text are being used, both must contain information that 
requires learners to refer to the other source in order to enable comprehension. If for 
example, a diagram is intelligible in isolation and contains all of the required infor-
mation, providing a spoken re-description of the diagram will no more generate a 
modality effect than providing a written description will generate a split-attention 
effect. The issue of text that re-describes a diagram is discussed in Chapter 11 on the 
redundancy effect.
The modality effect described in this chapter is associated with multimedia 
learning and instruction that use multiple forms of information input and represen-
tation. According to the available models of multimedia learning (Mayer, 2009; 
Schnotz, 2005), cognitive processing of related texts and pictures, including 
dynamic visualisations such as animations and simulations, involves the selection 
and organisation of the relevant elements of visual and auditory information resulting 
in a coherent unified representation. These processes occur in the learner’s working 
memory.
The cognitive architecture described in the early chapters of this book applies 
similarly to both the split-attention and the modality effects with one additional, 
critical point. Whereas we have not evolved to handle written text that refers to a

10 The Modality Effect
visual information such as objects, pictures or diagrams and so may need to learn 
how to process such information, it is very likely that we have evolved to listen to 
speech while looking at objects. If so, presenting information in dual-modality 
form may tap into biologically primary knowledge resulting in an advantage over 
visual only, written text plus objects, pictures or diagrams. Such visual-only infor-
mation may require us to acquire relevant biologically secondary information.
With respect to the general cognitive architecture of Part II, the presentation of 
information relies on the borrowing and reorganising principle to facilitate the 
transfer of information to the long-term memory information store, that informa-
tion needs to be structured to take into account the limitations of working memory 
as indicated by the narrow limits of change principle, and once knowledge is 
stored in long-term memory, it can be used to govern activity as specified by the 
environmental ­organising and linking principle. If dual-modality presentation 
taps into a ­biologically primary ability, it will automatically reduce working 
memory load ­leading to an advantage.
The Effect of Replacing Written with Spoken Text
While working memory is often treated as if it is a unitary structure, in fact it 
includes multiple processors that correspond to the modality in which information 
to be processed is presented. Several well-established models of working memory 
assume its functions are distributed over partly independent components usually 
associated with processing auditory/verbal or visual/pictorial information (e.g. 
Bandura, 1986; Penney, 1989; Schneider & Detweiler, 1987). For example, the 
model suggested by Baddeley (1986) includes three subsystems: a phonological 
loop, a visuospatial sketchpad and a central executive. The phonological loop 
­processes auditory information, while the visuospatial sketchpad processes picto-
rial or written visual information. In Penney’s (1989) “separate streams” model of 
working memory, processing of verbal items presented in auditory and visual forms 
is carried out independently by auditory and visual processors.
Thus, according to the most common theories of working memory, we have two 
different, partially independent processors for dealing with visual and auditory 
information. We will assume that both of these processors have capacity and 
­duration limitations. In some situations, effective working memory capacity may be 
increased by using both processors, and this possibility has important instructional 
implications associated with the presentation of information. The presentation 
­formats should be designed in a way that can help learners to avoid an unnecessary 
cognitive overload by using both, rather than a single processor. In that way, the 
cognitive load can be spread over both processors, thus reducing the load on a 
single processor.
Imagine two related sources of information presented in a visual form, for 
example, a diagram with an accompanying, explanatory, written text. Initially, both 
sources of information must be processed in the visual channel of working memory. 

131
The Effect of Replacing Written with Spoken Text
Subsequently, the visual text may be partially or fully re-coded into the auditory 
form for further processing but when dealing with written text, auditory processing 
cannot occur until after the text has been dealt with by the visual processor and 
­re-coded into auditory form. If high levels of element interactivity are involved in 
processing and integrating these two sources of information, the visual channel of 
working memory may become overloaded, especially when these sources are 
­spatially separated through a split-source presentation.
However, when one of the sources of information such as the text, when dealing 
with a diagram and text, is presented in an auditory form, it can be processed 
­immediately in the auditory channel of working memory without imposing a 
­cognitive load on the visual channel, while visual information such as diagrams 
continues to be processed in the visual channel. The use of both channels increases 
the capacity of working memory, although it does not consist of a simple addition 
of the capacity of both channels because they are only partially independent. 
Nevertheless, the amount of information that can be processed using both auditory 
and visual channels should exceed the processing capacity of a single channel. In 
addition, dual-modality presentations eliminate possible visual split-attention that 
may occur when only visual sources of information are present.
Thus, limited working memory can be effectively expanded by using more than 
one presentation modality. The modality effect occurs when dual-modality presenta-
tions are superior to single-modality-only presentations of the same information. 
Instructional materials involving dual-modality presentations of related sources of 
information can eliminate cognitive overload in situations where equivalent single-
modality formats might fail. The resulting effect on learning is similar to the effect of 
physically integrating separate sources of information to eliminate split-attention.
A number of experiments have demonstrated that replacing written or on-screen 
text with orally narrated text improved student learning using several different 
­indicators of learning: higher post-test scores combined with lower cognitive load 
during instruction (e.g. Kalyuga, Chandler, & Sweller, 1999, 2000; Tindall-Ford, 
Chandler, & Sweller, 1997); less time required for subsequent problem solving 
(Jeung, Chandler, & Sweller, 1997; Mousavi, Low, & Sweller, 1995); and higher 
retention, transfer and matching tests scores (Mayer & Moreno, 1998; Moreno & 
Mayer, 1999; see Mayer, 2009 for an overview).
Mousavi et al. (1995), using geometry materials, first demonstrated the instruc-
tional modality effect. They hypothesised that if working memory has partially 
independent processors for handling visual and auditory material, effective working 
memory may be increased by presenting material in a mixed rather than a unitary 
mode. Therefore, the negative consequences of split-attention in geometry might be 
avoided by presenting geometry statements in auditory, rather than visual, form. 
The results of a sequence of experiments supported this hypothesis. They demon-
strated that a visually presented geometry diagram with statements presented in 
auditory form improved learning compared to visual-only presentations. Tindall-
Ford et al. (1997) replicated the initial results of Mousavi et al. (1995) by comparing 
an audio text/visual diagram or table in elementary electrical engineering with 
purely visually presented instruction. In addition, they also provided evidence for a 

132
10 The Modality Effect
cognitive load interpretation of the results by comparing cognitive load indicators 
using subjective rating scales.
An alternative explanation of the modality effect has been provided by Tabbers, 
Martens, and van Merriënboer (2004). They argued that the effect was caused by 
the reduction of extraneous cognitive load due to the simultaneous presentation of 
pictorial and verbal information in a dual-modality format rather than due to the 
effective expansion of working memory capacity. We can simultaneously listen to 
spoken text while looking at a diagram, but it is difficult or impossible to simultane-
ously read text while looking at a diagram, especially under split-source conditions. 
This argument is plausible. Nevertheless, Mousavi et al. (1995) studied the role of 
temporal contiguity in the modality effect by comparing sequential and simultaneous 
presentations of geometry diagrams and associated textual explanations in both 
visual-only and dual-modality formats and found no evidence for the influence of 
temporal contiguity on the modality effect. The effect was obtained irrespective 
whether the textual information was provided simultaneously with the diagrams or 
before the diagrams were presented. This result renders a temporal contiguity 
explanation of the modality effect unlikely.
The cognitive theory of multimedia learning (Mayer, 2005, 2009; Mayer & 
Moreno, 2002, 2003) has been used to provide detailed theoretical arguments that 
effectively supported the modality effect along with a cognitive load explanation. 
The works of Mayer and his collaborators have applied the modality effect to 
dynamic visualisations such as instructional animations. According to the cognitive 
theory of multimedia learning, different mental representations are constructed 
from verbal and pictorial information, and meaningful learning occurs when the 
learner actively establishes connections between these representations.
Within a framework of the cognitive theory of multimedia learning, Mayer and 
Moreno (2003) considered the modality effect as a means of off-loading some of the 
processing demands from the visual channel to the auditory channel. Mayer and his 
collaborators (Mayer, 1997; Mayer & Anderson, 1991, 1992; Mayer & Moreno, 1998; 
Moreno & Mayer, 1999; Moreno, Mayer, Spires, & Lester, 2001; for overviews, see 
Clark & Mayer, 2003 Mayer, 2009) have conducted many experiments demonstrating 
the superiority of dual-modality instructions for meaningful learning. In most cases, 
they used narrated scientific explanations of animated visuals as experimental materials. 
One of their findings was that the modality effect is usually stronger for measures of 
transfer rather than retention. Dual-modality presentations offload information from 
the visual channel, reduce extraneous load, and thus may leave more resources for 
germane cognitive processing (Harskamp, Mayer, & Suhre, 2007).
The Modality Effect in Interactive Learning Environments
Many earlier studies of the modality effect used well-structured, system-controlled 
instructions explaining procedures. In contrast, interactive learning environments 
usually involve non-linear features that allow learners to determine the sequence of 

133
The Modality Effect in Interactive Learning Environments
information access, select the content and its presentation format. Learners may 
choose different learning pathways depending on their interaction with the system, 
or they may just follow system suggestions. For example, electronic hypermedia 
learning environments include elements of information interconnected by hyperlinks 
and presented in various modalities. Such environments usually offer more learner 
control than traditional system-controlled, multimedia learning environments.
Most multimedia learning principles are believed to be applicable to hypermedia 
learning environments (Dillon & Jobst, 2005). However, Gerjets, Scheiter, 
Opfermann, Hesse, and Eysink (2009) failed to find evidence for a modality effect 
even though the hypermedia-based instruction in solving probability problems used 
in their study involved a relatively low level of learner control. While learners could 
choose to retrieve well-specified sources of information such as animations or 
audio text files with spoken explanations, to skip presented information, and to 
select the pacing of instruction, in all other respects, they had linear access to 
­information. Gerjets et al. (2009) concluded that the modality effect may not be 
applicable when designing hypermedia learning environments that do not provide 
sufficient information indicating whether students should use spoken rather than 
written explanations of animated visuals. Students may need to be prompted to use 
appropriate external representations (Gerjets, Scheiter, & Schuh, 2008). In ­addition, 
learner control of the pacing may have reduced the cognitive load associated with 
split attention in the case of the visual-only representations, similar to the findings 
of Tabbers et al. (2004). Since there was sufficient time to read the written materi-
als, written text resulted in similar, or even better, performance compared to transi-
tory spoken text. While these studies indicate that learner control may be a relevant 
variable when considering the modality effect, length and complexity of auditory 
information is a far more likely explanation of the findings (see Chapter 17 on the 
transient information effect).
An example of the effective use of dual-modality presentations for reducing 
­cognitive load in interactive, collaborative learning was provided by a study of After-
Action Review (AAR) procedures in a computer-based collaborative problem-solving 
environment (O’Neil & Chuang, 2007). Some of the verbal feedback was presented 
to learners in the auditory modality so that visual and auditory channels were both 
engaged in a complementary manner. The results indicated that this complementary 
audio/visual textual feedback significantly improved student content understanding 
and communication scores in comparison with visual-only text.
Animated pedagogical agents are visual characters enabled with speech, gestures, 
movements and other human-like behaviour. They have recently become very ­popular 
in interactive multimedia learning environments. Such agents increase the possibility 
of combining verbal and non-verbal forms of information (Atkinson, 2002; Atkinson, 
Mayer, & Merrill, 2005) and according to social agency theory (Atkinson et al., 2005; 
Mayer, Sobko, & Mautone, 2003; Moreno et al., 2001), may also enhance learner 
engagement by simulating natural human-to-human interactions.
Atkinson (2002) and Moreno et al. (2001) experimentally demonstrated modality 
effects with pedagogical agents. Mayer, Dow, and Mayer (2003) replicated the 
effect in an interactive agent-based environment. Students learned about electric 

134
10 The Modality Effect
motors by asking questions and receiving answers from an on-screen pedagogical 
agent who stood next to an on-screen diagram of the electric motor. Results of 
­post-test transfer tasks indicated that students performed better when the agent’s 
explanations were delivered as narration rather than on-screen text.
There are negative results using animated, interactive, pedagogical agents. Using 
instruction concerning the human cardiovascular system with college students, 
Dunsworth and Atkinson (2007) failed to demonstrate a modality effect with peda-
gogical agents comparing an agent with narration vs. an agent with on-screen text. 
They did, however, find a large and significant agent effect where an animated 
agent delivering aural instructions was more effective than on-screen text only. 
They also found an image effect in which an agent with aurally delivered instruc-
tions was superior to aural instructions only. It should be noted that the learning 
materials used by Dunsworth and Atkinson (2007) introduced many new scientific 
terms that had to be related with relevant visual information. We might expect very 
high levels of cognitive load associated with the transient, auditory information for 
students with little or no prior knowledge of the human circulatory system, explaining 
the failure to obtain a modality effect (Chapter 17).
Factors Moderating the Modality Effect
Most of the early studies of the instructional modality effect were conducted in 
strictly controlled, laboratory settings with relatively short instruction times and 
used materials from well-defined technical domains like mathematics (Jeung et al., 
1997; Mousavi et  al., 1995), science (Mayer & Moreno, 1998, 1999), and 
­engineering (Kalyuga et al., 1999, 2000; Tindall-Ford et al., 1997). These materials 
addressed explanations of technical or scientific processes and procedures with 
limited levels of learner control allowed. The studies were conducted mostly with 
senior high school students, higher education students and technical trainees. The 
applicability of the effect in domains and learning environments with different 
characteristics had to be further investigated.
For example, De Westelinck, Valcke, De Craene, and Kirschner (2005) investigated 
several multimedia design principles including dual-modality presentations using 
social sciences materials. The study failed to replicate multimedia, split-attention (see 
Chapter 9) and modality effects and in some cases, found statistically significant dif-
ferences opposite to those expected. Several other studies also reported failures to 
­replicate a modality effect under some conditions (e.g. Brünken, Plass, & Leutner, 
2004; Dutke & Rinck, 2006; Goolkasian, 2000; Lowe, 1999; Moreno & Durán, 2004; 
Schnotz & Bannert, 2003). Therefore, establishing the boundaries and conditions of 
the applicability of the modality effect is an important research issue.
Ginns (2005b) conducted a meta-analysis of modality effect studies based on 43 
experiments involving a broad range of instructional materials, age groups and 
outcome measures. The meta-analysis generally supported the positive effects of 
dual-modality presentations as well as the effect of two major moderators, the level 
of element interactivity and pacing of presentation.

135
Factors Moderating the Modality Effect
We indicated above that the modality effect only can be expected to be obtained 
if multiple sources of information must be processed together in order for the infor-
mation to be understood. There are several other conditions required for the 
­modality effect.
Levels of Element Interactivity
Tindall-Ford et al. (1997) found strong effects in favour of dual-modality formats 
only for materials with high levels of element interactivity. There were no differ-
ences between alternative formats for low element interactivity instructions. A suf-
ficiently high level of element interactivity for the learning material is an essential 
moderating factor for the modality effect. According to the element interactivity 
effect (see Chapter 15), instructional materials with very low levels of element 
­interactivity, or intrinsic cognitive load, are unlikely to demonstrate any benefits of 
dual-modality presentations or, indeed, any other cognitive load effects.
If learning materials are characterised by high levels of element interactivity, 
they may initially overload the visual channel. That overload may be escalated by 
split attention between visually presented sources of information that refer to each 
other. Using a dual-modality format in this situation may effectively reduce this 
load and expand cognitive resources available for learning, thus resulting in a 
modality effect. On the other hand, if learning materials have low levels of element 
interactivity, then even relatively high levels of extraneous cognitive load may still 
be within working memory limits and may not interfere with learning.
However, an excessively high level of element interactivity may also eliminate 
the advantages of dual-modality presentations. When dealing with complex, unfa-
miliar or abstract representations, learners may experience very high levels of 
intrinsic cognitive load, especially if they do not have sufficient prior knowledge 
relevant to the representations. Using complex, transitory, spoken information may 
itself overburden working memory, resulting in a failure to demonstrate a modality 
effect (see Chapter 17).
Pacing of Presentations
The meta-analysis by Ginns (2005b) indicated that strong effects of dual-modality 
presentations were observed only under system-paced conditions. Most experiments 
that initially established the modality effect used system-controlled pacing, and the 
fixed instruction time was determined by the pace of the narration in the dual-modality 
condition. Tabbers et al. (2004) noted difficulties with observing a modality effect 
under learner-controlled pacing of presentation. They investigated the modality 
effect in a realistic classroom setting with second-year university ­students studying 
a web-based multimedia lesson on instructional design for a ­relatively prolonged 
time (over an hour). The instruction was learner-paced (e.g. in the audio conditions, 

136
10 The Modality Effect
students had the opportunity to listen to narrated text repeatedly). The results indicated 
that students in the visual condition performed better than students in the audio 
condition on both retention and transfer tests. Students in the visual condition also 
spent significantly less time on the instructions, although slow downloading of the 
audio may have negatively influenced students’ attention and learning in the audio 
condition. It was suggested that the main reason for this “reverse modality effect” 
was the learner-paced environment in contrast to system-paced instructions used in 
earlier research.
In system-paced conditions, learners presented with visual text need to spend 
part of the fixed instruction time on visual search while constantly switching their 
attention back and forth between verbal and pictorial elements and mentally 
­integrating them while faced with a time constraint imposed by the system. These 
processes may result in a high extraneous cognitive load. In learner-paced presenta-
tions, students may have extra time to manage this load by reviewing the material 
at their own pace. In this case, the benefits of dual-modality formats could be 
reduced or eliminated. More available time for processing and relating the text to 
the pictures presumably may compensate for extraneous cognitive load. For example, 
learners can read segments of printed text repeatedly without the risk of ­missing 
important elements of transitory, narrated information. In realistic settings though, 
students do not usually have an unlimited amount of time to learn specific materials, 
and self-pacing is not always possible.
Thus, even though the modality effect was established mostly in laboratory-
based system-paced conditions, these conditions are not too distant from the reality 
of educational practice.
Harskamp et al. (2007) demonstrated the modality effect with a self-paced, web-
based multimedia science lesson in a regular school setting. Another experiment in 
their study showed that the effect occurred only with students who required less 
time to learn and not with students who took more time to learn. Thus, the differ-
ences in learning time between students may need to be taken into account when 
analysing conditions of applicability for the modality effect.
An Alternative Explanation for the Reverse Modality Effect
While the use of self-paced presentations can plausibly explain the elimination of 
the modality effect, it is difficult to see how it can explain a reverse modality effect 
where visual-only material is superior to audio-visual material. Leahy and Sweller 
(in press) provided an alternative explanation along with accompanying data. The 
theory and data will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 17 when discussing the 
transient information effect, but for the sake of completeness, we will provide a 
brief introduction here.
Successful demonstrations of the modality effect may require relatively brief, 
relatively simple, textual information. If the textual information is lengthy and 
complex, presenting it in spoken form may have negative consequences due to 

137
Factors Moderating the Modality Effect
cognitive load factors. We know working memory for novel information is severely 
limited in duration and we also know that spoken information is transitory. A 
lengthy, complex, high element interactivity segment of spoken text may exceed 
working memory limits. The same text presented in written form may be much 
easier to process because more time can be spent on complex sections while easier 
sections can be skimmed rapidly. We suggest that the reverse modality effect has 
been obtained exclusively using lengthy, complex, auditory textual material. 
Lengthy auditory material may overwhelm working memory and override any 
possible benefit due to an audio-visual presentation. The result is likely to be 
­superiority of a visual-only presentation resulting in a reverse modality effect.
Leahy and Sweller (in press) tested this hypothesis in two experiments. One 
experiment, using lengthy text, obtained a reverse modality effect with visual-only 
information proving superior to an audio-visual presentation. Another experiment 
used the same material but broke it down into much smaller segments and yielded 
a conventional modality effect with an audio-visual presentation being superior to 
a visual-only presentation.
In spite of the results of Tabbers et al. (2004), there is now considerable evidence 
that the use of either self-paced or system-paced conditions has no effect on the 
modality effect (e.g. Harskamp et  al., 2007; Schmidt-Weigand, Kohnert, & 
Glowalla, 2009; Wouters, Paas, & van Merriënboer, 2009). Nor is there any theo-
retical reason to suppose that pacing should result in a reverse modality effect. In 
contrast, based on cognitive load theory considerations, the length of textual mate-
rial should affect the modality effect. Some studies that fail to find an effect and all 
studies that have found a reverse modality effect seem to use much longer, more 
complex auditory segments than studies that succeeded in obtaining a modality 
effect. The suggestion that lengthy auditory segments may overwhelm working 
memory accords closely with cognitive load theory. The data provided by Leahy 
and Sweller (under editorial consideration) support this hypothesis.
Reducing Visual Search
When a diagram is accompanied by a spoken explanation, learners usually still 
have to search through the diagram to locate the sections being referred to in the 
auditory text. Dual-mode presentations often show superiority over alternative 
single-modality formats only when techniques for attracting student attention to the 
relevant sections of the diagram are used. A cueing or signalling effect provides an 
example (Jeung, Chandler, & Sweller, 1997; Mayer & Moreno, 2002, 2003). Jeung 
et al. (1997) compared three conditions: visual only, audio-visual and audio-visual 
with flashing in which the relevant sections of the diagram flashed whenever they 
were referred to by the audio statements. Two types of geometry tasks were used 
that differed in the degree of complexity of the required visual search. A modality 
effect was observed only when a flashing technique was used as a cue and only in 

138
10 The Modality Effect
the case of complex visual search. The results showed that the audio–visual with 
flashing format was superior to the other two conditions that did not differ between 
themselves.
It was suggested that learners have to hold auditory information while searching 
for the relevant visual information on the screen. If this search is too complex and 
extensive to be accomplished simultaneously with the spoken explanation, an 
advantage of a dual-modality format may not be obtained unless appropriate 
visual signals are used to coordinate visual and auditory information and thus 
assist the learner in locating and processing the relevant information. In contrast, 
if the ­material is simple and so does not require assistance in locating relevant 
sections, element interactivity may be too low to generate a modality effect. 
Dual-modality presentations may only enhance learning when appropriate visual 
cues are added to relate corresponding elements in spoken text and complex, 
visual representations.
Mayer and Johnson (2008) demonstrated that a short on-screen version of 
­narrated text that highlighted its key points and was placed next to the correspond-
ing portions of a graphic could provide an appropriate visual signal. In two 
­experiments using a series of narrated static slides explaining lightning formation 
and how a car’s braking system works, each slide appeared for 8–10 s and ­contained 
a diagram with a brief (1–2 sentences) narration. In one format, each slide also 
contained 2–3 printed words placed next to the corresponding part of the diagram 
that were identical to the words in the narration and conveyed the main event 
described in the narration. Results demonstrated that the format with embedded 
short phrases (labels) resulted in better post-test retention scores than the format 
without the phrases, with no difference on the transfer test. It was suggested that 
the embedded on-screen words guided the learners’ attention in locating the rele-
vant graphical information.
Lee and Kalyuga (2011) have recently provided additional evidence to support 
this assumption. They demonstrated that a conventional method of presenting 
Chinese characters and verbal pronunciation instructions concurrently resulted in 
better learning of pronunciation when written pronunciation information was 
provided next to new key characters in the sentences to draw learners’ attention. 
Again, the placement of written information guided attention to appropriate parts 
of a visual display (see Chapter 9 on the split-attention effect).
Summary of Conditions of Applicability
Under appropriate conditions as defined by cognitive load theory, the modality 
effect is stable and robust. Nevertheless, like all extraneous cognitive load effects, 
the critical issue is always whether an extraneous cognitive load is imposed, not 
whether a particular category of instruction is used. Simply using audio-visual 
instructions can never guarantee improved learning if those audio-visual instructions 

139
Instructional Implications
do not reduce extraneous cognitive load. We have identified several conditions 
required to obtain the modality effect:
	(a)  As is the case for the split-attention effect, diagrammatic and textual information 
must refer to each other and be unintelligible unless they are processed together.
	(b)  Element interactivity must be high. If element interactivity is low, neither the 
modality effect nor any other cognitive load effect can be obtained.
	(c)  Auditory text must be limited. Lengthy, complex text should be presented in 
written, not spoken form. Lengthy text that cannot be held and processed in 
working memory will prevent a modality effect and can generate a reverse 
modality effect.
	(d)  If diagrams are very complex, cuing or signalling may be required so that 
­learners can focus on those parts of the visual display being referred to by the 
auditory information.
There is one other known condition that affects the modality effect that will not be 
discussed in detail in this chapter. Levels of learner expertise may also influence 
the effect. Even though most of the research studies investigating the modality 
effect have been conducted with novice learners, there is evidence that the effect 
may be eliminated or reversed with relatively more experienced learners  
(e.g. Kalyuga et al., 2000). The expertise reversal effect that explains the reasons 
why cognitive load effects are not obtainable with more knowledgeable learners 
will be considered in detail in Chapter 12.
Instructional Implications
The major instructional implication that flows from the modality effect is that under 
certain, well-defined circumstances, there can be considerable benefits to presenting 
information in a dual-mode, audio-visual form rather than in a visual-only form. Care 
must be taken to ensure that the conditions for the superiority of audio-visual instruc-
tions apply. The most important conditions, all of which flow directly from cognitive 
load theory, are that the audio and visual sources of information must rely on each 
other for intelligibility, element interactivity needs to be high and the audio component 
needs to be sufficiently short to be readily processed in working memory.
There are many curriculum areas where these conditions can be readily met. 
Many areas of mathematics and science provide examples. Statements such as 
“Angle ABC equals Angle XBZ (vertically opposite angles are equal)” in associa-
tion with a geometric diagram may be far better presented in spoken rather than 
written form. Audio-visual presentation is likely to be beneficial because the 
­diagram and the text must be processed in conjunction with each other, element 
­interactivity in geometry is usually very high, and the statement can readily be held 
and processed in working memory. By using auditory rather than visual text, visual 
working memory resources can be devoted entirely to the diagram while auditory 
memory resources are used to process the text. By sharing the cognitive load 

140
10 The Modality Effect
between the auditory and visual processors, the visual processor is less likely to be 
overloaded and so learning should be facilitated.
Equally, there are many curriculum areas where the use of dual-mode presentation 
is quite inappropriate. Lengthy text that does not have to be processed in conjunction 
with a diagram, or anything else, will not lead to the modality effect. Simply presenting 
information in an audio-visual format does not guarantee the advantages that accrue 
from the modality effect. The ultimate criterion is not whether an audio-visual format 
is used but rather, whether extraneous cognitive load is reduced. If it is not reduced, 
an audio-visual format will not assist and may even interfere with learning.
Conclusion
When textual information accompanying pictures, animations or simulations is 
presented in an auditory rather than visual form, working memory capacity may be 
effectively increased by using the combined resources of the visual and auditory 
channels of working memory rather than loading all information on the visual 
­channel. Dual-modality presentations can be used to reduce the extraneous cogni-
tive load caused by visual split-attention. Within a cognitive load framework, the 
modality effect is explained by a more efficient use of the available cognitive 
resource. By engaging two channels of working memory and by reducing visual 
search and associated split-attention situations when verbal information is ­presented 
in the auditory modality, learning can be facilitated.
It is frequently suggested that presenting the same verbal information in both 
an auditory and a visual modality could enhance learning. A shallow interpretation 
of the modality effect can readily lead to this conclusion. However, the available 
­evidence obtained within a cognitive load framework indicates that presenting the 
same information simultaneously in spoken and written forms is not advanta-
geous. The following chapter will discuss this evidence within the context of the 
redundancy effect.

141
The redundancy effect may appear on the surface to be related to the split-attention 
effect but in fact is quite unrelated. There are similarities because both effects deal 
with multiple sources of information such as visuals and text. As is the case for the 
split-attention effect, any combination of diagrams, pictures, animations and 
­spoken or written verbal information can lead to the generation of extraneous 
­cognitive load. Nevertheless, despite their surface similarities, the redundancy 
effect has very different characteristics to the split-attention effect. The two effects 
differ because the logical relations between the multiple sources of information 
required as essential pre-requisites to produce each effect differ; that difference is 
critical and should never be ignored.
As was discussed in Chapter 9, the split-attention effect occurs when learners 
must integrate in working memory multiple sources of related information pre-
sented independently but unintelligible in isolation. A set of geometry statements 
such as Angle ABC equals Angle XYZ cannot be fully comprehended without 
reference to a diagram. Both sources of information, the diagram and the state-
ments, must be present and if presented in physically separate form, must be men-
tally integrated because they refer to each other. The working memory resources 
used to accomplish this integration become unavailable for learning and may 
exceed the available capacity of working memory.
This chapter describes a different logical relation between the multiple sources 
of information. The redundancy effect may occur when the multiple sources of 
information can be understood separately without the need for mental integration. 
Written or spoken text that simply re-describes a diagram that can be fully 
­understood without the text provides an example. In this situation, the physical 
integration of, for example, the written text with the diagram is unlikely to be 
­beneficial. There is no reason to suppose that learning will be enhanced by physi-
cally integrating within a diagram text superfluous to comprehension. Indeed, such 
conditions may be detrimental to learning by imposing an extraneous cognitive 
load. Accordingly, redundant information should be omitted to preclude an increase 
in extraneous cognitive load caused when learners inevitably focus attention on 
unnecessary information and physically integrate it with essential information.

11 The Redundancy Effect 
Using the example of a diagram and redundant text, rather than presenting a 
self-explanatory diagram and a verbal explanation that just re-describes the ­diagram 
(either as visual text, spoken text or both), it should be beneficial to present the 
diagram alone without any explanatory text.
The most common form of redundancy occurs when the same information is 
presented in different modalities. A diagram with text that re-describes the diagram, 
or text presented in both spoken and written form provide examples. Nevertheless, 
it needs to be noted that in cognitive load theory, any additional information not 
required for learning is classified as redundant. A cartoon associated with text does 
not re-describe the text but is still redundant if it is not required to understand the 
text, as is an explanation of sections of a procedure that learners already ­understand. 
Any information presented to learners that they may unnecessarily process is 
redundant. Cognitive load theory does not distinguish between types of redundant 
information because it is assumed that they have the same negative cognitive 
­consequences that can be eliminated by the same instructional procedures, i.e. the 
omission of such redundant information.
The redundancy effect occurs when information that includes redundant mate-
rial results in less learning than the same information minus the redundant material. 
The effect provides a clear example of extraneous, interacting elements. If essential 
information is provided along with unnecessary information, the elements asso-
ciated with the unnecessary information are likely to be processed resulting in an 
extraneous working memory load. That extraneous working memory load ­violates 
the narrow limits of change principle that requires working memory load to be 
minimised. Less information will be transferred to the long-term memory infor-
mation store resulting in less effective use of the environmental organising and 
­linking principle, the critical principle used to generate action. It follows that only 
essential information should be presented to learners in order to maximise use of 
the borrowing and reorganising principle when acquiring information.
Some Empirical Evidence for the Redundancy Effect
Chandler and Sweller (1991) first demonstrated the redundancy effect within a 
cognitive load framework using learning materials consisting of text and diagrams 
that did not have to be mentally integrated in order to be understood. In several 
experiments with electrical engineering materials, learners who were not explicitly 
requested to integrate text and diagrams needed less time to learn but performed 
better than learners who were explicitly instructed to integrate text and diagrams. 
Furthermore, a single self-explanatory diagram was found to be superior to the 
­text-and-diagram instructions in either a conventional or an integrated form.
These results were replicated in experiments with biology materials using a self-
contained diagram of blood flow through the human body. The diagram indicated, for 
example, that blood flowed from the left ventricle of the heart into the aorta. The cor-
responding statement said, ‘Blood is also forced from the left ­ventricle into the aorta’. 
The relation of this statement to the diagram should be carefully noted. It is very 

143
Some Empirical Evidence for the Redundancy Effect
different to the relation of a statement such as, ‘Angle ABC = Angle XYZ’ associated 
with a geometry diagram. The diagram of the blood flow in the heart, lungs and 
body can be readily understood in isolation. The statements merely repeat informa-
tion that is clear from the diagram. They do not say something that is essential to 
understand the solution to a problem as occurs in the case of a ­geometry problem 
solution. In the blood flow example, the ­additional, explanatory textual segments 
were redundant and interfered with learning.
Furthermore, an integrated format in which the statements were integrated with 
the diagram was even less effective than conventional instruction with separated 
diagrams and text. The diagram-only format resulted in the best learning outcomes. 
It was assumed that processing redundant text would impose an extraneous 
­cognitive load and require additional working memory resources. In a conventional 
split-source format, learners can partially reduce this load by ignoring the text 
(Chandler & Sweller, 1991). It is more difficult to ignore the text when it is 
­physically integrated with the diagram. Bobis, Sweller, and Cooper (1993) also 
replicated the redundancy effect using a paper-folding learning task with primary 
school students. In this study, diagrams were redundant and a text-only instruc-
tional format resulted in the best learning outcomes.
The redundancy effect is pervasive. It can be found in a wide variety of instruc-
tional contexts unrelated to diagrams and text. For example, traditional forms of 
instruction found in manuals or presented as on-screen instruction provided with 
software packages or technical equipment usually require using the actual hardware 
or equipment when following the instructions. As indicated in Chapter 9 on the 
­split-attention effect, if such instructions are essential, they may cause learners to 
split their attention between the manuals, computer screen and keyboard, or the 
equipment, and so result in a heavy extraneous cognitive load. If the instructions 
replicate information obtained more readily in other forms, the redundancy effect 
may need to be considered. For example, presenting learners with diagrams of 
hardware as well as the hardware itself may lead to redundancy. There may be 
learning benefits in eliminating the computer hardware or equipment during the 
initial stages of instruction and using diagrams of the computer screen and ­keyboard 
or technical equipment with embedded textual instructions instead. Including both 
the hardware and the diagrams may lead to redundancy and a heavy extraneous 
cognitive load that interferes with learning.
In a series of experiments, such integrated diagram and text instructions placed 
in a manual without the hardware being available to learners were compared to 
manuals with hardware (Sweller & Chandler, 1994; Chandler & Sweller, 1996). 
Beneficial effects of the integrated manual only instructions without the presence 
of actual hardware were demonstrated in both written and practical skill tests 
despite reduced learning times and the absence of any practical experience using 
the hardware prior to the tests. The results suggested that the hardware was redun-
dant and the manual only instructions were self-explanatory for the learners.
These results should not be interpreted as indicating that it is necessarily better 
to learn, for example, how to use software without access to functioning software. 
The results should be interpreted as indicating that it is better to learn either 
with access to the software (or hardware) or with diagrams and integrated text 

144

­representing the software and hardware, but not both. Cerpa, Chandler, and 
Sweller (1996) found that presenting instructions on a screen alone was superior 
to presenting them on both a screen and in a manual. In combination with the 
results indicating that it is better to learn from a manual alone than a manual plus 
equipment, we can conclude that it does not matter whether instructions are 
­presented on a screen or in a manual. The important point is that they should not 
be presented simultaneously in both forms. The extraneous cognitive load associ-
ated with redundancy will interfere with learning if students must process similar 
material on a screen and in a manual. Learning is enhanced if the material is 
­presented in one or the other, but not both.
Pociask and Morrison (2008) demonstrated the effectiveness of eliminating 
redundant information in instructional materials used for teaching complex, ortho-
paedic, physiotherapy cognitive and psychomotor skills to first-year physiotherapy 
students in a realistic classroom setting. The performance measures that included 
written and psychomotor tests, ratings of cognitive load and task completion times 
indicated significantly increased learning outcomes and reduced levels of cognitive 
load for the modified, instructional format group.
The Effect of Simultaneously Presented Written  
and Spoken Text
As indicated in the previous section, the split-attention and redundancy effects 
appear to be related because they both feature multiple sources of information. For 
similar reasons, the modality effect described in the previous chapter and the 
­multimedia redundancy effect described in this section appear to be related but are 
not. The relation between the sources of information determines whether a modality 
effect or a redundancy effect will be obtained. Whether material should be 
presented in audio-visual form or in visual form alone is determined by the relation 
between the multiple sources of information. If two or more sources of information 
refer to each other and can only be understood in conjunction, they should be 
­presented in audio-visual form, if possible. In contrast, if the two sources of infor-
mation can be understood in isolation, only one source, either the audio or the 
visual source should be used. If both are used, one source will be redundant and 
having to process both will lead to an extraneous cognitive load.
Thus, deciding whether both sources or only one source should be used depends on 
the relation between the two sources. Geometry statements that cannot be understood 
without reference to a diagram should be presented in spoken form, or physically 
integrated if they must be presented in written form. In contrast, descriptions of blood 
flow that merely re-describe a highly intelligible diagram should not be presented in 
spoken or indeed, written form. They should be eliminated. The logical relation 
between a diagram and text is important, not the existence of a diagram and text.
Many multimedia instructional materials use narrated explanations simultaneously 
with written text. From a cognitive load perspective, such duplications of essentially 

145
The Effect of Simultaneously Presented Written and Spoken Text 
the same information in two different modalities may overload working memory 
and have negative rather than positive learning effects. When spoken explanations 
are used concurrently with the same written text, learners may also be required to 
relate and coordinate the corresponding elements of written and spoken information. 
This extraneous to learning processing may consume additional working memory 
resources. Therefore, eliminating a redundant source of information might be 
beneficial for learning.
Kalyuga, Chandler, and Sweller (1999) used computer-based instructions in 
mechanical engineering to compare three different forms of textual explanations 
presented together with an animated diagram: written text, spoken text and written 
plus spoken text. The results demonstrated a multimedia redundancy effect. The 
spoken text group outperformed the written text plus spoken text group with a 
higher posttest score, a lower number of re-attempts at interactive exercises and a 
lower subjective rating of cognitive load. Subjective ratings of cognitive load 
­indicated that presenting on-screen textual explanations of the diagram together 
with the same auditory explanations actually resulted in additional cognitive load.
Using scientific explanations of animated visuals with instructions explaining 
the formation of lighting storms, Mayer, Heiser, and Lonn (2001) demonstrated in 
two experiments with university students that learners who studied narrations with 
­concurrent animations performed better on retention and transfer posttests than 
learners who studied animations with concurrent narration and on-screen text that 
either summarised or duplicated the narration. Craig, Gholson, and Driscoll (2002) 
demonstrated a similar effect with animated pedagogical agents in which visual 
characters were enabled with speech, gestures, movements and other human-like 
behaviours.
This effect of superior learning following spoken rather than spoken and written 
text was clearly demonstrated by Kalyuga, Chandler, and Sweller (2004). Both in 
instructional and other contexts, identical or similar verbal information frequently 
is provided in simultaneous spoken and written form. This tendency has increased 
first with the advent of overhead projectors and then with the introduction of 
PowerPoint because both of these technologies facilitated the simultaneous presen-
tation of spoken and written text. Based on the redundancy effect, we might expect 
learning to be inhibited by the concurrent presentation of the same information in 
both modalities. Using technical, text-based instructions without diagrams 
(Experiment 3), Kalyuga et al. (2004) obtained precisely this effect. Learning was 
facilitated when instructions were presented in spoken form alone rather than both 
spoken and written forms concurrently.
Jamet and Le Bohec (2007) tested the effect of presenting learners with information 
on the development of memory models. One group were presented diagrams along 
with spoken information. The other two groups were presented exactly the same 
­diagrammatic and spoken information along with the equivalent written ­sentences 
presented either sequentially, sentence by sentence, or as a full-text group in which the 
sentences were displayed as a block next to the diagram. In a variety of subsequent 
tests, the spoken text alone group demonstrated superior learning to either of the 
­spoken plus written text groups, demonstrating that the written text was redundant.

146
11 The Redundancy Effect 
Gerjets, Scheiter, Opfermann, Hess, and Eysink (2009) obtained a multimedia 
redundancy effect in hypermedia learning. Hypermedia consists of multimedia learning 
environments with elements of information interconnected by a network of hyper-
links to increase levels of learner interactivity. Gerjets et al. (2009) demonstrated 
that arithmetical information supplemented with spoken and written explanations 
resulted in less efficient instruction than providing written only text. Also, in this 
study, spoken only explanations did not result in better learning than the dual-
modality redundant format. These results may indicate that lengthy spoken text is 
unlikely to improve learning in any combination – with diagrams, written text, or 
both – as lengthy, complex, spoken information may generate a heavy working 
memory load in its own right (see Chapter 17 on the transient information effect). 
The role of the length of instructional segments is discussed below in the section 
on conditions of applicability of the redundancy effect.
The Redundancy Effect in Second/Foreign Language Learning
The negative effects on learning of presenting the same information in spoken and 
written form can be expected to have particular relevance when learning a second 
language. The redundancy effect has been mostly investigated in technical domains 
(e.g. mathematics, science, or engineering) with relatively well-structured problems. 
It was important to replicate these results and investigate the conditions of applica-
bility of the effect in relatively poorly specified task areas that are typical of the 
social sciences and humanities. Foreign or second language acquisition is an impor-
tant domain for the extension of cognitive load research. There have been a number 
of recent studies of cognitive load theory implications for instructional design in this 
area. For example, Moussa, Ayres and Sweller (in preparation) reported a redun-
dancy effect in learning English as a foreign language. They established that a 
simultaneous presentation of oral and written material could inhibit learning and, 
paradoxically, students could learn to listen more efficiently by reading alone rather 
than by reading and listening at the same time. This result is only likely to be obtain-
able using learners with some degree of proficiency in listening. Plass, Chun, Mayer, 
and Leutner (2003) found that pictorial annotations were redundant for second 
language learners’ reading comprehension.
Using first-year tertiary students as participants, Diao, Chandler, and Sweller 
(2007) and Diao and Sweller (2007) investigated whether the redundancy effect 
would apply to reading comprehension in learning English as a foreign language by 
comparing written presentations only and written presentations concurrent with 
verbatim spoken presentations. They suggested that for learners who had not 
achieved a sufficiently high level of foreign language proficiency, the listening rate 
could lag far behind the reading rate (Hirai, 1999) resulting in poor audio-visual 
correspondence. When the same text is presented in different modalities, learners 
must process these two sources of information simultaneously and build referential 
relations between them. Because decoding text presented even in a single modality 

147
The Redundancy Effect in Second/Foreign Language Learning
may impose a heavy working memory load for beginner foreign language learners, 
they may have no available working memory capacity to read and listen at the same 
time, resulting in a redundancy effect.
Results demonstrated that the presence of a concurrent spoken presentation 
­rendered reading comprehension less effective compared with written only instruc-
tions. At the lexical level, the concurrent presentation group gained less lexical 
knowledge than the read only group. At the level of text comprehension, the concur-
rent presentation group reported a higher cognitive load and demonstrated a lower 
level of main /general idea understanding and recall. Also, as can be expected from 
the element interactivity effect (Chapter 15), the interference of a concurrent spoken 
presentation was more evident for a textual passage with more complex syntax and 
text structures and, accordingly, a higher level of intrinsic cognitive load.
These results contradict the common practice of teachers to read out a text 
while students follow their words in a textbook. It needs to be noted that there is 
extensive evidence in the literature on second/foreign language comprehension 
suggesting a positive effect of presentations consisting of concurrent written and 
spoken text (e.g. Borrás & Lafayette, 1994; Garza, 1991; Markham, 1999). 
Almost without exception, these results are due to a common, specific flaw in the 
experimental designs used. There is a difference between comprehension and 
learning. If learners are presented text and then given a comprehension test, they 
will almost always score more highly on that test if the information is presented 
in dual-modality rather than single-modality form because they can choose to 
concentrate on reading or listening, whichever they feel will most increase com-
prehension. Nevertheless, in instructional contexts, an increase in comprehension 
is less important than an increase in what has been learned and an increase in 
comprehension does not mean more has been learned. To determine whether 
more has been learned, learners must be presented with new material following 
the phase in which dual- or single-modality material has been presented. They 
should be tested for their comprehension on that new material rather than the 
original material. If they have learned more following a single- or dual-modality 
presentation of the original material, then comprehension of the new material 
should be improved and a comprehension test of the new (not the old) material 
should demonstrate the extent to which learning has occurred during the original 
presentation of the old material under single- or dual-modality conditions. Using 
this experimental design, the common result suggests that single-modality 
­presentations result in more learning than dual-modality presentations (Diao & 
Sweller, 2007; Diao, Chandler, & Sweller, 2007; Moussa, Ayres, & Sweller, in 
preparation).
Thus, cognitive load theory suggests that when teaching novice second/foreign 
language learners to read or to listen, the common procedure of presenting both 
written and spoken text simultaneously may not be appropriate. If the aim of 
instruction is to teach novice learners to read, involving them in listening together 
with reading instruction could interfere with rather than facilitate learning. 
Furthermore, beyond the novice level, learning to listen is facilitated more by reading 
than by listening and reading.

148
11 The Redundancy Effect 
Evidence for the Redundancy Effect in Pre-Cognitive  
Load Theory Research
Several examples of phenomena that can readily be related to the redundancy effect 
were demonstrated before cognitive load theory was developed and applied to 
redundancy. These examples are notable in that in a very wide variety of disciplines 
and procedures, they provide evidence of the redundancy effect but have no consis-
tency in their theoretical explanations. None were explained in terms of a working 
memory load.
Reder and Anderson (1980, 1982), in a particularly interesting example of 
redundancy, found that students could learn more from summaries of textbooks 
than from the full chapters. Most textbook writers take the traditional view that 
providing learners with additional information is at worst neutral in its effects and 
could be beneficial. Not only is information frequently presented at considerable 
length, redundant material such as cartoons and other irrelevant pictorial informa-
tion is often included. All require scarce working memory resources to process. 
From a cognitive load theory perspective, it is not surprising that more can be 
learned from a summary than a full textbook chapter, consistent with the result 
obtained by Reder and Anderson.
Schooler and Engstler-Schooler (1990) found that the requirement to verbalise a 
visual stimulus could impair its subsequent recognition. Verbalising visual informa-
tion can be difficult and may place a considerable load on working memory. 
Furthermore, that load may add little to the ability to subsequently recognise the 
visual material, explaining the Schooler and Engstler-Schooler results in terms of 
redundancy and cognitive load.
Lesh, Behr, and Post (1987) found that mathematical word problems could 
become more difficult to solve if additional concrete information is included in the 
problem statements. Many mathematics educators have suggested that the difficulty 
students have in learning to solve word problems could be ameliorated by the inclu-
sion of concrete, physical representations of the problems. Some of these sugges-
tions can be sourced to a Piagetian view of the distinction between concrete and 
formal operational thought. Piagetian stage theory suggests that we learn to mani­
pulate concrete objects prior to learning to manipulate more abstract, formal entities. 
In fact, whether or not we know how to manipulate concrete objects, we still need 
to be able to process the abstract representations of objects incorporated in many 
word problems. If working memory resources are devoted to manipulating the con-
crete objects, we may have insufficient resources left to learn how to deal with their 
abstract equivalents. Seeing the objects is merely likely to interfere with learning 
how to manipulate the abstract representations, leading to redundancy.
Using a flow diagram of the nitrogen, water, oxygen and carbon dioxide cycles, 
Holliday (1976) demonstrated that high school students who studied a diagram only 
achieved better comprehension than two groups that studied the diagrams alongside 
a text that presented the same material, or the text alone. Students who were presented 
with text and diagrams performed no better than those who studied the text only. 

149
Factors Moderating the Redundancy Effect
The diagram alone was all that was needed to learn the material. Adding text to the 
diagram was redundant while text alone either did not include sufficient information 
or else provided the information in a form that was difficult to process.
Miller (1937) demonstrated that presenting children with a word associated with 
a picture was less effective than the word alone in teaching children to read. In order 
to learn to read, working memory resources must be devoted to the graphics that 
constitute text. Based on cognitive load theory and the redundancy effect, nothing is 
gained by devoting working memory resources to pictures as well as the text. Most 
beginning readers know what a cat looks like and do not need to see a picture of a cat. 
Their working memory resources need to be concentrated on the graphics that con-
stitute the written word ‘cat’. Miller’s results were replicated by Saunders and Solman 
(1984) who demonstrated that adding pictures to words interfered with learning.
It might be noted that this picture-word effect equally applies to learning to read 
whole sentences as well as individual words. Torcasio and Sweller (2010) extended 
this work to learning to read phrases and sentences. They found that the picture 
books commonly used to teach young children to read and consisting of sentences 
on one page and corresponding pictures on the opposite page resulted in less learning 
than the same sentences without the pictures. For young children, learning to read 
requires them to attend to a sentence such as ‘Mrs. Smith lived in the house on the 
hill’. If they see a picture of Mrs. Smith and the house on the hill, working memory 
resources are likely to be devoted to the picture rather than the text resulting in less 
textual learning compared to learners who only see the text, a classic redundancy 
effect.
It can be seen that there is a wealth of data demonstrating the redundancy effect. 
Until the advent of cognitive load theory, most of these results had little influence 
because they were treated as individual, unrelated findings. Hopefully, the advent 
of cognitive load theory and knowledge of the redundancy effect will result in a 
reconsideration of these important findings.
Factors Moderating the Redundancy Effect
Investigating specific boundaries for the redundancy effect is an important 
research issue. Some established conditions required for the redundancy effect 
are described below.
Independence of Information Sources
We have emphasised above and in previous chapters that the split-attention and 
modality effects are obtainable only when the related sources of information are 
unintelligible in isolation. In contrast, this chapter is concerned with conditions 

150
11 The Redundancy Effect 
under which sources of information are intelligible in isolation. An example is 
­textual information presented in written and/or spoken form that merely re-describes 
a diagram, a table or another section of text. If a diagram, table or text is intelligible 
in isolation and contains all of the required information, its spoken and /or written 
re-description should be eliminated rather than included. We have emphasised these 
points because they frequently are ignored in the literature.
For the redundancy effect to occur, either source of information must be 
­intelligible separately. If a source of information (textual or graphical) is fully intel-
ligible on its own, then any additional redundant sources of information should be 
removed from the instructional materials rather than integrated into them.
Levels of Element Interactivity
As with other cognitive load effects, sufficiently high levels of element interactivity 
for the learning material are an essential moderating factor if the redundancy effect is 
to be observed. According to the element interactivity effect (see Chapter 15), instruc-
tional materials with low levels of element interactivity and consequently, a low 
intrinsic cognitive load, are unlikely to demonstrate noticeable benefits from eliminating 
redundant elements of information. Even relatively high levels of extraneous cogni-
tive load may still be within working memory limits and not interfere with learning. 
In contrast, if learning materials are characterised by high levels of element interactivity 
and therefore generate a heavy intrinsic cognitive load, an additional extraneous cog-
nitive load caused by processing redundant information can be harmful to learning.
For example, a modified, self-contained manual without a requirement to refer to 
actual hardware can be beneficial compared to the manual plus the hardware, but only 
for tasks characterised by high levels of element interactivity (Chandler & Sweller, 
1996). No redundancy effect was demonstrated by Chandler and Sweller (1996) for 
low element interactivity material. Measures of cognitive load confirmed the impor-
tance of element interactivity to the redundancy effect. Significantly better test results 
associated with a lower cognitive load favoured an integrated, modified manual only 
group compared to the manual and hardware group in areas of high element interac-
tivity. No effects were found in areas of low element interactivity.
At the other end of this spectrum, when dealing with excessively complex mate-
rials for which learners do not have sufficient prior knowledge, very high levels of 
intrinsic cognitive load may be experienced. Even eliminating redundant sources of 
information for such materials may not alleviate the experienced cognitive over-
load, resulting in a failure to demonstrate a redundancy effect.
Pacing of Presentations
In most audio-visual learning experiments that have demonstrated multimedia 
redundancy effects, system-controlled pacing was used, and the fixed instruction 

151
Factors Moderating the Redundancy Effect
time was determined by the pace of the narration. In such conditions, learners 
­presented with visual text in addition to its auditory form need to engage in visual 
search by switching their attention back and forth between on-screen text and pictorial 
elements while under strict time constraints imposed by the system. These 
processes may result in a high extraneous cognitive load. In learner-paced presenta-
tions, students may review the material at their own pace with extra time available 
for managing potential overload, thus reducing the benefits of non-redundant 
­presentations. Of course, when narration is used, learner-paced presentations, while 
feasible, can be difficult to implement and difficult for students to use.
In two experiments with technical apprentices, Kalyuga, Chandler, and Sweller 
(2004) compared simultaneously presented written and auditory forms of the same 
information with an instructional format in which these sources of information 
were temporally separated with the redundant written text presented only after the 
narration ended. The experiments demonstrated that the sequential presentation of 
auditory and visual explanations of a diagram resulted in superior posttest scores 
and lower ratings of cognitive load than the concurrent presentation of the same 
explanations. However, this effect was obtained only when instruction time was 
constrained in a system-controlled condition (Experiment 2). There were no differ-
ences in a learner-controlled condition (Experiment 1). The unrestricted instruction 
time might have partially compensated for the unavailable processing resources that 
were used to deal with the increased extraneous load during concurrent presentation 
compared with sequential presentation. In contrast, in the restricted condition, 
simultaneous presentations may have overloaded working memory with neither 
visual nor auditory text processed adequately. The delayed presentation of the 
visual text could have effectively served as a repetition of the presentation, thus 
enhancing the positive effects of the earlier auditory text.
The Length of Instructional Segments
As was the case for the modality effect, the length of textual segments may also 
be a factor influencing the redundancy effect. When simultaneously processing 
uninterrupted, long textual descriptions presented in visual and auditory modali-
ties, learners may have to relate and reconcile too many elements of information 
within a limited time frame. Segmenting the text may eliminate negative effects of 
verbal redundancy.
Experiment 3 of Kalyuga et al. (2004) used lengthy, technical textual materials 
without diagrams and demonstrated a redundancy effect through concurrent presen-
tation of auditory and visual material compared with the auditory-only text. 
Possible influences of visual split attention were excluded in this experiment as no 
diagrams were involved. However, Moreno and Mayer (2002) demonstrated that 
when no visual diagrams were involved, concurrent presentations of the same audi-
tory and visual text produced better results than auditory-only text, indicating a 
reverse redundancy effect. This difference in results could be due to the length of 

152
11 The Redundancy Effect 
textual segments that were processed continuously. In the Kalyuga et al. (2004) 
study, the text was presented to participants continuously as a single large chunk of 
around 350 words without breaks. In contrast, Moreno and Mayer (2002) presented 
the text in several consecutive small segments with appropriate breaks between 
them. Such breaks may have allowed the learners to consolidate their partial mental 
models constructed from each segment of the text before moving to the next one.
Thus, if text is partitioned into logically complete and easily managed sequential 
segments with time breaks between them, a narration with concurrent, visual text 
may not only eliminate negative effects of verbal redundancy, but actually improve 
learning. For example, such formats could be effective for learners for whom the 
language of instruction is a second language and who may have problems with 
understanding auditory text without a written back-up. On the other hand, continu-
ously presenting long textual descriptions may contribute to the intrinsic complexity 
of instructional materials by forcing learners to relate and reconcile many elements 
of auditory and visual information within a limited time frame.
Thus, while demonstrating a modality effect may require relatively brief and 
simple textual information, the multimedia redundancy effect usually occurs if the 
textual information is lengthy and complex. Presenting this information in spoken 
form, especially concurrently with the same information in visual form, may cause 
a cognitive overload and have negative learning consequences similar to the 
reverse modality effect (Chapters 10 and 17). Lengthy sections of spoken text that 
is transitory in nature may exceed working memory capacity limits. Similar to the 
modality effect, the length of textual segments may override pacing of the presen-
tation as a factor influencing the conditions of applicability of the multimedia 
redundancy effect.
Summary of Conditions of Applicability
Several conditions that are essential for occurrence of the redundancy effect have 
been identified:
	(a)  Different sources of information must be intelligible independently with no 
requirement for mental integration and simultaneous processing.
	(b)  Element interactivity of learning materials must be high.
	(c)  For the multimedia redundancy effect, the text must be presented concurrently 
in written and spoken forms and be sufficiently lengthy and complex to cause 
high levels of working memory load.
It is also plausible that levels of learner expertise could influence the effect as 
the notion of redundancy may be affected by learner levels of expertise. Information 
that is essential and non-redundant for novices may become redundant for experts. 
The expertise reversal effect observed in such situations depends on the redundancy 
effect and will be considered in detail in the next chapter.

153
Instructional Implications
Instructional Implications
The major instructional implication that flows from the redundancy effect is that in 
many instructional situations, there may be more costs than benefits in concurrently 
presenting essentially the same information in different forms such as different 
modalities, or presenting any unnecessary information. The most important 
­conditions for the redundancy effect to occur, all of which flow directly from 
­cognitive load theory, are that the sources of information must not rely on each 
other for intelligibility, element interactivity should be high, and where different 
verbal modalities are involved, the audio component needs to be sufficiently com-
plex to impose high processing demands on working memory.
There are many instructional situations that meet these conditions. For example, 
the effect may often occur during PowerPoint presentations when large amounts of 
textual information are presented on the screen and simultaneously narrated by the 
presenters. In this situation, the audience needs to relate the on-screen text with the 
presenter’s oral explanations, often also needing to pay attention to additional 
graphical information presented on the screen. These processes may require exces-
sive working memory resources that become unavailable for comprehending and 
learning essential information. Reducing the on-screen text to a short list of the 
most important points and explaining them in detail orally may provide a better 
presentation technique.
Repeatedly occurring examples of redundancy can be found in maps, street direc-
tories, pie-charts and other diagrams complemented with textual explanations. When 
a diagram is self-contained, any additional verbal explanations can unnecessarily 
distract learner attention and generate an extraneous cognitive load irrespective of 
whether they are presented in an integrated visual form, auditory form or both.
Many traditional manuals instructing people how to use various software 
­applications or technical devices require learners to simultaneously pay attention to 
explanations in the manual, in many cases, illustrated by screenshots or pictures, to 
the actual computer screen or equipment, and also enter data or commands using 
the computer keyboard. In addition to the common occurrence of split-attention, 
these types of instruction may also contain redundant sources of information, most 
notably, the computer or device itself. These sources of redundancy may contribute 
to high levels of extraneous cognitive load. As was noted above, temporarily elimi-
nating computers or redundant hardware at the initial stages of learning should 
facilitate learning. Such self-contained manuals, dealing with highly interactive 
components of instruction, have proved to be effective for novice computer users 
(Sweller & Chandler, 1994; Chandler & Sweller, 1996). Eliminating the manual 
and placing all information on the screen also may be effective from a cognitive 
load perspective. In this case, the only role of the computer during the initial stages 
of learning would be to turn on-screen pages. After learners acquire some 
knowledge of the application or hardware, they will be able to handle higher levels 
of cognitive load because the effective capacity of working memory increases 

154
11 The Redundancy Effect 
­significantly when dealing with familiar information (see Chapter 4). Therefore,  
in the following stages of learning, the computer may be used for more interactive 
modes of learning. However, in areas where motor components and spatial-motor 
coordination are essential (e.g. typing), extensive practice with real equipment from 
initial learning is likely to remain essential.
Conclusions
For many of us, a common sense perspective often suggests that by presenting the 
same information in multiple forms such as presenting verbal information in both 
auditory and visual modalities will enhance student learning. Counter to this 
­intuition, the available experimental evidence obtained within a cognitive load 
framework indicates that this perspective may contain a basic fallacy and 
­instructional presentations involving redundant information more often inhibit 
rather than enhance learning. This chapter reviewed the theory and empirical 
­evidence, outlining the conditions under which the redundancy effect might occur.
Within a cognitive load framework, the redundancy effect is explained by the 
increases in extraneous cognitive load generated by the need to process redundant 
information. Learners who are presented with several sources of essentially the 
same information simultaneously such as written and spoken text may need to 
attempt to coordinate them. Randomly searching for connections between 
­elements from different sources of information that are not related to the learning 
goal can produce heavy demands on working memory and thus be detrimental to 
learning. Even when additional sources of information are unrelated to the major 
source such as background music, talk or movement, they are likely to capture 
attention and so divert working memory resources away from the task at hand, 
resulting in a reduction in learning due to redundancy. Irrelevant, unnecessary 
information can easily capture working memory resources and reduce learning. It 
should be eliminated.
The notion of redundancy may depend on levels of learner expertise. Information 
that is essential and non-redundant for novices may become redundant for experts. 
Therefore, as learners acquire more expertise in a domain, the information that has 
been previously essential and non-redundant may become redundant and cause 
increased levels of extraneous cognitive load for these learners. The associated 
expertise reversal effect will be considered in detail in the following chapter.

155
The expertise reversal effect was initially predicted by cognitive load theory as a 
form of the redundancy effect (see Chapter 11) that occurs when information ben-
eficial to novice learners becomes redundant to those more knowledgeable. It is one 
of several cognitive load effects that rely on an interaction between a basic cogni-
tive load effect, in this case the redundancy effect, and other factors, in this case 
levels of expertise. As an example of the expertise reversal effect, detailed textual 
explanations, especially if they are embedded into diagrams thus reducing the pos-
sibility of ignoring them, may be essential for novices but redundant for experts.
When discussing the redundancy effect, we dealt with material and learners for 
whom additional information was redundant. In the case of the expertise reversal 
effect, we are concerned with a combination of material and learners for whom, in 
the case of novices, the additional material is essential for understanding but for 
experts, the same additional material is redundant. Novices, because of their levels 
of knowledge when dealing with these materials, may be unable to process infor-
mation contained in diagrams unless additional textual material is included. Neither 
textual explanations nor diagrams are redundant for novices in this situation, as 
these sources of information are not intelligible independently for these learners. In 
contrast, presenting the same textual information and diagrams to experts may 
require them to process material superfluous to their understanding, consuming 
unnecessarily additional cognitive resources compared with instruction which 
excludes this material. A series of empirical studies, as described below, confirmed 
this prediction.
The expertise reversal effect flows as a logical consequence of some fundamen-
tal features of human cognitive architecture. The critical role of learner knowledge 
in long-term memory is central to human cognition. As was indicated in Part II, 
long-term memory provides an information store and information in that store can 
drive appropriate action via the environmental organising and linking principle. It 
is therefore reasonable to expect that levels of learner knowledge (or levels of 
learner expertise) should influence the occurrence of all cognitive load effects. If 
learners already have acquired information, requiring them to process that informa-
tion again via the borrowing and reorganising principle may result in an extraneous 
cognitive load due to the narrow limits of change principle. Learners who already

have acquired information will be unnecessarily processing excess interacting 
elements. In contrast, learners who do not have the required information will need 
to process those elements. Instructional procedures need to reflect these differing 
cognitive states. Instructional techniques and procedures that are optimal for novice 
learners may become suboptimal when learners acquire more expertise in the 
domain.
Most of the studies reviewed in the previous chapters were conducted with nov-
ice learners who did not possess substantial amounts of relevant, domain-specific 
knowledge. While novices are more in need of instruction than more expert learners, 
as expertise increases, there still is a need for instruction and that instruction may 
differ substantially from that required by novices. As learners acquire more exper-
tise in a specific area of knowledge, the information or activities that previously 
were essential may become redundant, causing increased levels of extraneous cog-
nitive load. As a consequence, instructional techniques effective for novices may 
become ineffective for more expert learners due to redundancy. Conversely, tech-
niques ineffective for novices may become effective for more expert learners. These 
changes in the relative effectiveness of instructional procedures according to levels 
of expertise underlie the expertise reversal effect. This chapter describes empirical 
findings associated with the expertise reversal effect, their interpretation within a 
cognitive load theory framework, their relation to some associated studies under-
taken prior to the development of cognitive load theory, the conditions of applica-
bility of the effect and finally its instructional implications.
Some Empirical Evidence for the Expertise Reversal Effect
Within the cognitive architecture described in Part II of this book, knowledge 
structures in long-term memory perform an executive role in complex cognitive 
processes by appropriately directing learner attention and governing perfor-
mance (see Chapter 4). To handle a task in the absence of suitable knowledge, 
learners need to perform mostly random and cognitively inefficient search pro-
cesses followed by tests of their effectiveness with an inevitable and frequently 
considerable expenditure of working memory resources, resulting in cognitive 
overload. When knowledge is absent, direct, explicit instruction may provide an 
effective substitute for the missing knowledge-based executive function. For 
novice learners, externally provided instruction may be the only available source 
of executive function. For more knowledgeable learners, on the other hand, 
much of the required knowledge may be available in long-term memory. At 
intermediate levels of expertise, these two sources may complement each other, 
with an executive function ideally based on long-term memory knowledge when 
dealing with familiar elements of information, and on direct instruction when 
dealing with unfamiliar elements of information.
When direct instructional guidance is not provided to novices for dealing 
with new units of information, for example, during unguided discovery learning,  

157
Some Empirical Evidence for the Expertise Reversal Effect
an extraneous cognitive load may be generated that reduces resources available for 
learning. On the other hand, an extraneous load may also be generated if direct 
instructional guidance is provided to learners who already have a knowledge base 
sufficient for dealing with the information presented. These learners are likely to 
need to reconcile the information available in long-term memory knowledge with 
the externally provided guidance. That need to reconcile two different sources of 
essentially identical information requires working memory resources leading to an 
extraneous cognitive load. Thus, as levels of learner knowledge in a domain 
increase, the provision of the same information during instruction may become 
redundant and so an instructional technique that was relatively effective for novices 
may become relatively ineffective for more knowledgeable learners. Instruction 
that is optimal for novices may hinder the performance of more experienced learners 
by distracting them from fluently executing already learned procedures and taking 
full advantage of their available knowledge base. There are several categories of the 
expertise reversal effect that have been investigated empirically. These are dis-
cussed in the following sub-sections.
Longitudinal Studies
Initial investigations of the effect were conducted in a series of longitudinal studies. 
Groups of technical apprentices were intensively trained from novice to more expert 
states of knowledge in engineering areas (Kalyuga, Chandler, & Sweller, 1998, 2000, 
2001; see Kalyuga, Ayres, Chandler, & Sweller, 2003; Kalyuga, 2007 for overviews). 
Levels of learner performance and cognitive load were measured at different points 
to observe changes in the relative effectiveness of different instructional methods.
The first experiments observed the consequences of changes in expertise on the 
split-attention effect (Chapter 9) using instructional materials that included textual 
on-screen explanations of electrical wiring diagrams. It was demonstrated that 
physically integrated formats with sections of text embedded into diagrams that 
were effective for novices compared to a split-source format became ineffective as 
learners acquired more knowledge in the domain (Kalyuga et  al., 1998). After 
extensive training in the domain, the effectiveness of the integrated diagram and 
text format decreased while the effectiveness of a diagram-alone condition 
increased. Subjective ratings of cognitive load also indicated that diagrams alone 
were easier to process for more knowledgeable learners while an integrated dia-
gram and text format was easier to process for less knowledgeable learners. Thus, 
for novices, the text was essential to understand the diagram and so needed to be 
presented in an integrated format. A diagram alone was ineffective because novices 
needed the text. With increasing expertise, the text gradually became redundant 
and needed to be eliminated rather than integrated. The reversal in status of the 
integrated diagram and text format from most to least effective, and the concomi-
tant inverse status reversal in the diagram-alone condition with increasing expertise 
(i.e. least to most effective) provides an example of the expertise reversal effect.

158
12 The Expertise Reversal Effect
In subsequent studies (Kalyuga et al., 2000, 2001; Kalyuga, Chandler, Tuovinen, 
& Sweller, 2001), more evidence for similar interactions was obtained. For example, 
detailed narrated explanations of how to use specific types of diagrams in mechanical 
engineering that were presented concurrently with animated diagrams were effec-
tive for novice learners in comparison to written explanations, thus demonstrating 
the modality effect (Chapter 10). However, after a series of intensive training ses-
sions, when the same learners achieved higher levels of expertise, presenting a 
version of the diagrams with detailed narrated explanations inhibited learning com-
pared to instruction including diagrams only Kalyuga et al. (2000). As knowledge 
levels increased, the advantage of the narrated diagrams over a diagram-alone con-
dition gradually disappeared, and eventually reversed in comparison with results 
obtained for novice learners. For more expert learners, diagrams alone were better 
than the same diagrams along with narration. Subjective ratings of cognitive load 
supported a cognitive load explanation of the phenomenon.
Kalyuga, Chandler, Tuovinen, et  al. (2001) showed that the advantages of 
worked examples on how to program industrial equipment over learning by prob-
lem solving (the worked example effect, see Chapter 8) disappeared as trainees 
acquired more knowledge in the task domain. In an additional experiment, worked 
examples and problem-solving instruction were compared for students learning to 
write Boolean switching equations for relay circuits. Comparisons were made ini-
tially using less experienced learners and then after two consecutive training ses-
sions. By varying the number of elements in the circuits, it was possible to gradually 
increase the level of task difficulty throughout the experiment and observe continu-
ous development of learner expertise in the domain. Because the learners were 
sufficiently knowledgeable at the beginning of the experiment, worked examples 
were of no advantage in comparison with the problem-solving procedure. With 
additional training, worked examples became redundant, resulting in a negative 
effect compared with problem-solving practice. Thus, this experiment demon-
strated that with increasing expertise, an initial result indicating no difference 
between worked examples and problem solving changed to an advantage for prob-
lem solving.
A full switch from the worked example effect to a reverse worked example effect 
was obtained by Kalyuga, Chandler, and Sweller (2001). They compared worked 
examples with exploratory-based instructions on writing switching equations for 
relay circuits. Although the worked examples group initially outperformed the 
exploratory group, as the level of learner expertise increased after a series of train-
ing sessions, the exploratory group eventually outperformed the worked examples 
group. It should be noted that these experiments demonstrating the decreasing and 
eventually reversing advantages of worked examples compared to problem solving 
as expertise increases are critical to the guidance fading effect, discussed in the next 
chapter.
Nückles, Hübner, Dümer, and Renkl (2010) provided evidence of the expertise 
reversal effect in learning journal writing skills. Journal writing provides an example 
of cognitive and metacognitive strategies and is an effective follow-up after a 
lecture or seminar session in which students are asked to reflect on the previously 

159
Some Empirical Evidence for the Expertise Reversal Effect
studied material. Two studies investigated long-term effects of instructional support 
for writing learning journals provided in the form of prompts for applying appropriate 
cognitive and metacognitive strategies. Students wrote a journal entry about each 
weekly seminar session over a whole term. One group received prompts, while 
another group received no prompts. In the first half of the term, while students were 
still novices, the prompt group applied more strategies in their learning journals and 
showed higher learning success rates than the no-prompt group. Towards the end of 
the term, with increases in expertise, the amount of cognitive and metacognitive 
strategies elicited by the prompt group decreased while the number of cogni­
tive strategies applied by the no-prompt group increased. Accordingly, when learning 
success was measured again at the end of the term, the prompt group performed 
worse than the no-prompt group. In order to avoid these negative long-term effects 
of prompts, a gradual and adaptive fading-out of the prompts was subsequently 
introduced. (See the following chapter for details of the fading effect.)
Brunstein, Betts, and Anderson (2009) investigated the effects of minimal guid-
ance during instruction on learning (Kirschner, Sweller, & Clark, 2006) using 
algebra tuition. They found that with sufficient practice, minimal guidance was 
superior to explicit instruction but with less practice, minimal guidance was inferior 
to explicit instruction. These results are in accord with the expertise reversal effect. 
Once students have learned enough during practice, they no longer require guid-
ance and indeed, redundant guidance has negative effects. Guidance via explicit 
instruction is required when learners have had limited practice and so limited expe-
rience. This result also is in accord with the guidance fading effect discussed in the 
next chapter.
Cross-Sectional Studies Using Worked Examples  
and Other Forms of Guidance
We discussed the expertise reversal effect and worked examples in longitudinal 
studies above (Kalyuga, Chandler, & Sweller, 2001, Kalyuga, Chandler, Tuovinen, 
et al., 2001). In those studies, learners were given sufficient training to increase 
their levels of expertise. Cross-sectional studies achieve the same aim by using 
learners who currently differ in levels of expertise.
Based on the expertise reversal effect as exemplified in the longitudinal studies, 
it might be expected that novice learners would benefit from well-guided instruction 
that reduces their need for random search for suitable solution steps. For more expe-
rienced learners, on the other hand, studying detailed instructional guidance and 
integrating it with available knowledge that provides essentially the same informa-
tion might generate an unnecessary extraneous cognitive load. A number of studies 
have indicated that while less knowledgeable students benefited more from worked 
examples that provide considerable guidance than from problem solving with less 
guidance, for more knowledgeable learners, the benefits of minimally guided 
instruction were apparent. For example, Tuovinen and Sweller (1999) compared 

160
12 The Expertise Reversal Effect
worked examples with minimally guided exploratory-based instruction on how to 
use a database program. Worked examples were better than exploration for low-
knowledge learners, but the difference disappeared for higher knowledge learners.
Kalyuga and Sweller (2004) obtained a similar pattern of results using coordinate 
geometry with high school students divided into two groups of relatively more and less 
knowledgeable learners based on pretest scores. Results of the posttest indicated a 
significant interaction between knowledge levels and instructional formats. Less knowl-
edgeable students benefited more from worked examples providing guidance. For more 
knowledgeable learners, there was a clear indication of problem-solving benefits.
Reisslein, Atkinson, Seeling, and Reisslein (2006) compared the effectiveness of 
different approaches to sequencing instructional guidance for university engineer-
ing students with different levels of expertise in the domain. While novices bene-
fited more from worked examples, more experienced learners benefited more from 
various versions of problem solving.
Kyun, Kalyuga and Sweller (in preparation) demonstrated an expertise reversal 
effect in learning English literature. In three experiments, Korean university students 
for whom English was a foreign language answered essay questions. The experimen-
tal design was based on the design used to demonstrate a traditional worked example 
effect (Chapter 8). During the learning phase, half of the students i.e. those in the 
problem-solving condition, were presented conventional essay questions that they 
were asked to answer. The other half of the students, i.e. those in the worked example 
condition, were presented the same questions along with model answers that they 
were asked to study, followed by similar questions that they had to answer them-
selves. All students then were asked to answer retention, near and far transfer tests. 
Experiment 1 and 2 used more knowledgeable students, while Experiment 3 used 
students with minimal knowledge of the subject. For the retention, near and far trans-
fer tests, there were no significant effects for the students of Experiment 1, while for 
Experiment 2, the worked example group performed significantly better on the reten-
tion test. In Experiment 3, the worked example group was significantly better on the 
retention test and marginally significantly better on near transfer tests. Furthermore, 
using efficiency measures (see Chapter 6), the less knowledgeable students of 
Experiment 3 revealed a worked example superiority on all measures while the more 
knowledgeable students of Experiments 1 and 2 revealed a superiority on none of the 
test measures except for the retention test in the case of Experiment 2. In summary, 
more knowledgeable learners did not need the assistance of worked examples while 
less knowledgeable students did need worked examples in these language-based stud-
ies, similar to the results of Kalyuga, Chandler, Tuovinen, and Sweller (2001) and 
Kalyuga, Chandler, and Sweller (2001) in technical training areas.
Seufert (2003) compared a no-help condition with two kinds of assistance in 
studying scientific text and pictures. The first type of assistance consisted of direc-
tive support in which students were given specific guidance while the second type 
of assistance consisted of non-directive support using questions to students with 
non-specific hints. The results indicated that for learners with a lower level of prior 
knowledge, both directive and non-directive assistance conditions were sig-
nificantly better than the no-help condition, with the direct help better than the 

161
Some Empirical Evidence for the Expertise Reversal Effect
non-direct help condition. On the other hand, for learners with a higher level of 
prior knowledge, there were no differences between these conditions.
In one of the earliest demonstrations of the expertise reversal effect, Yeung, 
Chandler, and Sweller (1998) compared a traditional technique of placing a glossary 
of unfamiliar words at the end of the whole text with integrating the glossary defini-
tions into the text directly above the defined word. As was expected, with novice 
learners (primary school students) separate glossaries caused a split-attention effect, 
and better comprehension was achieved using the integrated definition format. 
However, more experienced learners (university students) demonstrated better com-
prehension with the separate glossary format. The same reversed pattern of results 
was obtained using 8th grade students at different levels of English as a second lan-
guage experience. Low-knowledge students benefited from the integrated instruction, 
while more experienced learners benefited from the separate glossary format (Yeung 
et al.). Novice learners needed the glossary and could use it more effectively if split-
attention was eliminated. Experienced learners did not need the glossary but could 
ignore it when it was placed at the end of the text. If it was integrated into the text, 
the redundant information was harder to ignore and interfered with text processing.
Oksa, Kalyuga, and Chandler (2010) investigated the effects of explanatory 
notes on comprehension of Shakespearean text. Such texts are usually replete with 
classical references communicated through a language that is markedly different 
from Modern English. High levels of extraneous cognitive load may be imposed by 
traditional formats of such texts due to split attention as students search through 
endnotes or refer to footnotes. The design of instructional materials that was 
expected to assist learners in comprehending Shakespearean plays was based on 
interpretations of play extracts in Modern English that were physically integrated 
line by line with Shakespeare’s original Old English text. In two experiments, 
extracts from different plays (Othello and Romeo and Juliet) were used with novice 
groups of high school students who had no prior knowledge of the texts. As 
expected, the results demonstrated that the integrated explanatory condition group 
reported a lower cognitive load and performed better in a comprehension test than 
the traditional format group that had the explanations in footnotes rather than inte-
grated with the text. In another experiment, the same material was presented to a 
group of professional Shakespearean actors who were experts in interpreting the 
text. A reverse effect occurred, with the traditional format group outperforming the 
integrated explanatory condition group. The test performance data along with 
verbal protocols indicated that the explanations were redundant for these high-
knowledge readers. Those explanations could be ignored when placed as an end-
note but interfered with processing when integrated with the text. Thus, an expertise 
reversal effect was demonstrated in the literary comprehension area.
Using high school biology instructional texts, McNamara, Kintsch, Songer, and 
Kintsch (1996) found that a highly coherent text explaining all details benefited 
low-knowledge readers while high-knowledge readers benefited from a minimally 
coherent format. From a cognitive load perspective, the high-knowledge learners 
may have found the minimally coherent text intelligible without additional explana-
tory information that could increase working memory load. This text was coherent 

162
12 The Expertise Reversal Effect
for these learners because of their available knowledge base while the text with full 
details was redundant. However, for less knowledgeable learners, the additional 
explanatory information was required while the reduced text contained insufficient 
information for these learners to adequately process. The interaction between levels 
of expertise and textual detail provides an example of the expertise reversal effect.
Pawley, Ayres, Cooper, and Sweller (2005) found an expertise reversal effect 
when investigating the augmentation of worked examples with a checking strategy. 
Learning how to generate and solve simple algebraic equations, students were also 
shown how to check the accuracy of their answers. This additional help was shown 
to benefit students with low levels of general mathematical ability, but not students 
with higher levels of mathematics, who scored lower in tests if they were also 
taught checking methods. Clearly, more able students found instruction to check 
their answers redundant.
Lee and Kalyuga (2011) investigated cognitive load aspects of learning Chinese 
language using a phonic transcription system called pinyin. Because traditional 
Chinese characters provide pictorial rather than phonetic information, it is conven-
tionally taken for granted that the phonetic nature of pinyin is always useful in 
providing pronunciation information for Chinese characters. It is also a common 
practice to present characters with both pinyin and verbal pronunciation instruc-
tions concurrently. The results demonstrated that such concurrent presentations 
resulted in better learning of pronunciation only for learners beyond the beginner 
level. For less experienced learners, no differences were found between pinyin and 
no-pinyin transcription conditions. For these learners, concurrent presentation of 
pinyin and verbal pronunciation instructions represented excessive information, 
overwhelming working memory. Additional information, while potentially useful, 
in practice could not be used until sufficient knowledge had been acquired. The 
more experienced learners had sufficient knowledge to be able to use the additional 
information without cognitive overload. For these learners, a pinyin condition 
outperformed the no-pinyin format.
Expertise Reversal and the Isolated Elements Effect
According to the isolated elements effect (see Chapter 16), presenting complex 
material as a set of isolated elements of information that ignore relations between 
the elements during the initial stages of learning may reduce an excessive intrinsic 
cognitive load. While students do not learn the necessary interactions between ele-
ments, that learning can be left to later. Learning isolated elements allows students 
to build partial schemas that can be converted to full schemas with additional 
instruction that emphasises the interactions between elements (Pollock, Chandler, 
& Sweller, 2002). Such isolated elements learning tasks followed by fully interact-
ing elements instruction benefited low-knowledge learners. However, this method 
did not provide an advantage for learners with higher levels of prior knowledge in 
the domain, thus demonstrating an expertise reversal effect. High knowledge learn-
ers were able to process the interacting elements and so did not need to have the 
information presented in isolated form.

163
Some Empirical Evidence for the Expertise Reversal Effect
Blayney, Kalyuga, and Sweller (2010) investigated an expertise reversal effect 
in the area of accountancy training with undergraduate university students. Blayney 
et al. compared two instructional formats that differed in their levels of generated 
intrinsic cognitive load: An isolated-interactive elements instructional format and a 
fully interactive elements format. The results provided support for the predicted 
expertise reversal effect. Learner levels of expertise interacted with instructional 
formats using isolated or interactive elements of information. As expected, novice 
learners benefited from studying isolated elements first. In contrast, more experi-
enced learners benefited primarily from the fully interacting elements instruction 
that allowed these learners to take advantage of their knowledge base. When more 
experienced learners were presented the isolated elements instruction, these learn-
ers had to integrate and cross-reference the simplified and for them, redundant 
information with their available knowledge. That process may have unnecessarily 
consumed additional cognitive resources. The Blayney et al. (2010) study replicated 
the findings of Ayres (2006b) who found that students with little mathematical 
knowledge benefited from worked examples in an isolated elements format in 
learning elementary algebra tasks, whereas student with more mathematical knowl-
edge benefited more from worked examples demonstrating the interactive elements 
more fully.
Expertise Reversal and the Variability Effect
The variability effect occurs when students learn more by studying highly variable 
worked examples rather than worked examples with more similar features (Chapter 16). 
Scheiter and Gerjets (2007) looked at two types of variability. They presented 
learners with algebra word problems that were grouped either according to their 
surface features or according to their structural features. Grouping according to surface 
features resulted, for example, in all motion problems or all finance problems being 
grouped together. Grouping according to structural features placed together all 
problems requiring the same type of algebraic equation for solution.
In their first experiment, Scheiter and Gerjets found that surface feature group-
ing enhanced performance more than structure grouping performance. Placing 
together structurally different problems that look the same teaches learners how to 
distinguish the important structural features of problems and ignore irrelevant sur-
face features. Scheiter and Gerjets second experiment was similar except that they 
divided learners into those with less knowledge of the problem categories according 
to structure and those with more knowledge. The results indicated that for learners 
with less knowledge, the results were similar to those obtained in the first experi-
ment. Grouping according to surface features was better because these students 
needed to learn the defining, structural features. Those structural features differed 
from problem to problem with surface feature grouping. Reverse results were 
obtained for the learners with more knowledge of structural features, providing an 
example of the expertise reversal effect. These more expert learners performed better 
when the problems were grouped according to structural rather than surface features. 

164
12 The Expertise Reversal Effect
Learners who already can distinguish between problem structures, do not need to 
be taught how to make this distinction. It is a redundant activity. They merely need 
to practice the procedures needed to solve the various categories. Placing problems 
with the same solution together allows learners to devote their working memory 
resources to learning how to solve each category of problem without interference 
by different categories of problems.
If this interpretation of Scheiter and Gerjets results is valid, it suggests that 
learners who have not learned to distinguish between problem categories need to be 
taught the relevant distinctions. The manner in which problems are grouped may 
assist in acquiring this knowledge. How one should group problems depends on 
levels of expertise. While these results are promising, they still await replication.
Pre-Training and the Expertise Reversal Effect
Both the initial use of worked examples and of isolated elements constitute a form 
of pre-training. There are other examples of pre-training and the expertise reversal 
effect that do not explicitly rely on worked examples or isolated elements.
Clarke, Ayres, and Sweller (2005) investigated the use of spreadsheets to learn 
mathematics. Before learning mathematics using spreadsheets, learners must know 
how to use spreadsheets. They may be taught mathematics and how to use spread-
sheets simultaneously or they may be taught how to use spreadsheets first and then 
taught mathematics using spreadsheets. Clarke et  al. investigated interactions 
between the timing of learning spreadsheet skills and levels of learner expertise. In 
the sequential condition, instructions on how to use spreadsheets were provided 
prior to applying this knowledge in learning mathematics. In the concurrent condi-
tion, instructions on using spreadsheet and mathematical concepts were presented 
concurrently in an integrated form so that necessary new spreadsheet skills were 
acquired during the learning of mathematical concepts. The results indicated that 
students with low-level knowledge of spreadsheets learned mathematics more 
effectively in the sequential formats. On the other hand, students who were more 
experienced in using spreadsheets benefited more from an integrated format. 
Measures of cognitive load (using subjective ratings) supported a cognitive load 
interpretation of the effect. Concurrently presented information on spreadsheet 
applications and mathematics could overload novice learners, thus inhibiting learning 
compared to a sequential presentation. In contrast, for more experienced learners 
who already had acquired basic spreadsheet skills, such information may be redun-
dant. Thus, when learners are technologically inexperienced, the technology should 
be learned prior to learning a specific subject area. More experienced learners may 
learn relatively new technological skills concurrently with learning a specific sub-
ject discipline (Clarke et al., 2005).
Van Gog, Paas, and van Merriënboer (2008) compared the relative effectiveness 
of product-oriented worked examples and process-oriented worked examples with 
learners at different levels of prior knowledge. Traditional, product-oriented worked 

165
Some Empirical Evidence for the Expertise Reversal Effect
examples demonstrate only the procedure for obtaining the final product by providing 
a step-by-step solution without explanations supporting each step. In contrast, 
process-oriented worked examples include statements explaining why each step is 
taken (Van Gog, Paas, & van Merriënboer, 2004). Students were exposed to product–
product, product–process, process–product or process–process sequences. Although 
a transfer test administered after the first phase demonstrated no significant differ-
ences between conditions, when combined with measures of cognitive load, it 
resulted in better efficiency indicators for learners who studied process-oriented 
examples than for learners who studied product-oriented examples. After two prac-
tice sessions, the process–product group outperformed the process–process group 
and demonstrated higher efficiency. Van Gog et al. (2008) concluded that process-
oriented worked examples could be more efficient than product-oriented worked 
examples, but only during the initial stages of learning. As the learners acquired 
more experience during the learning phase, the process-related information could 
become redundant causing an expertise reversal effect.
Expertise Reversal for Multimedia and Hypermedia 
Representations
Early studies of cognitive aspects of multimedia learning demonstrated that using 
graphics with text usually enhanced learning outcomes for students with low prior 
knowledge levels, but not for those with higher knowledge levels (e.g. Mayer & 
Gallini, 1990; Mayer, Steinhoff, Bower, & Mars, 1995; see Mayer, 2009 for an 
overview). Recent studies in this area have provided more evidence for the exper-
tise reversal effect.
Using sophisticated, dynamic visual representations of gas law simulations in 
middle-school chemistry, Lee, Plass, and Homer (2006) obtained an expertise 
reversal effect with two different modes of representations. A format using words 
such as ‘temperature’, ‘pressure’ and ‘volume’ along with corresponding numerical 
values was compared with an identical format with added visual scaffolds such as 
depictions of burners for temperature and weights for pressure. While low 
prior knowledge students benefited more from the added iconic scaffolds, high prior 
knowledge learners benefited more from symbolic only representations. The visual 
scaffolds are likely to have been redundant for these learners.
Homer and Plass (2010) used similar formats that compared purely symbolic 
versus added iconic representations in web-based simulations of the Kinetic Theory 
of Gases. They examined the effect of individual learner characteristics by measur-
ing learner spatial abilities in addition to levels of prior knowledge, hypothesising 
that icons were more likely to help learners with lower rather than higher levels 
of spatial ability. This result was obtained. Adding iconic representations to the 
simulation significantly facilitated learning for low prior knowledge students only.
Schnotz and Rasch (2005) compared the effects of animated and static pictures 
concerned with the relation of time to the Earth’s rotation. Low-experience students 

166
12 The Expertise Reversal Effect
learned more from static pictures than from animated pictures, while there were no 
differences for high-experience students. In a follow-up experiment, two different 
forms of animations were compared: simple visual simulations and more complex, 
interactive animations allowing manipulations of parameters. High-experience students 
learned more from interactive animations than from simple simulations, while low-
experience learners benefitted more from simple simulations than from interactive 
animations.
These results can be explained by assuming that for novice learners, continuous 
animations may be too cognitively demanding due to high levels of transience (see 
Chapter 17 for cognitive load aspects of learning from animations and the transience 
effect that occurs when information that is presented disappears as instruction contin-
ues). These learners may benefit more from studying equivalent static pictures. More 
knowledgeable learners may be able to handle the transience of animations. This 
assumption was supported by a study by Kalyuga (2008a) that investigated the inter-
action between levels of learner expertise and effectiveness of animated and static 
examples. University students learned how to construct graphs of linear and quadratic 
equations. The study demonstrated that less knowledgeable students learned better 
from static diagrams that showed major transformation stages on one screen. Students 
with higher levels of prior knowledge learned better from animated instructions.
Similar considerations may apply to hypertext and hypermedia learning. High 
prior knowledge learners may be able to process random instructional segments 
without overloading working memory using their existing knowledge, and chang-
ing the levels of structure in the presented materials may make little difference to 
performance. Low prior knowledge learners may experience cognitive overload 
when dealing with unstructured materials by devoting most of their cognitive 
resources to search processes resulting in these resources being unavailable for 
constructing relevant schemas. These learners may therefore benefit from more 
structured and restricted hypertext environments (Shapiro, 1999; Shin, Schallert,  
& Savenye, 1994). The most important factor may not be the specific form of 
learning materials (linear or hypertextual), but rather how well the material is struc-
tured. Well structured hypertext may be better suited for novice learners than poorly 
structured traditional linear text.
Amadieu, van Gog, Paas, Tricot, and Mariné (2009) explored the effects of prior 
knowledge on cognitive load when learning from non-linear hypertext concept 
maps in the area of biology. Structured maps demonstrated explicitly the hierarchy 
in relations between concepts, while unstructured maps showed only the network 
of relations without an explicit hierarchy. The results showed that low prior knowl-
edge learners gained more conceptual knowledge from the structured format. These 
learners also indicated less cognitive load in the posttest performance after learning 
from the structured format. On the other hand, there was no difference for high 
prior knowledge learners on conceptual knowledge gains from both formats. Both 
types of learners indicated less cognitive load involved in processing the structured 
concept maps. Amadieu, Tricot, and Mariné (2009) demonstrated that for low prior 
knowledge learners, the hierarchical structure better supported their free recall of 
the material, while high prior knowledge learners performed better after studying 

167

the unstructured format. Low prior knowledge learners needed the information 
provided by the hierarchical structure. The same information was redundant for 
high prior knowledge learners and so processing that information imposed an extra-
neous cognitive load that interfered with further learning, providing a classic exper-
tise reversal effect.
Using multimedia materials in chemistry, Seufert, Schütze, and Brünken (2009) 
found the modality effect for measures of comprehension and transfer with learners 
who were less skilled in using memory strategies. The modality effect was not 
obtained with highly skilled learners indicating an expertise reversal effect.
The Expertise Reversal Effect and Aptitude-Treatment 
Interactions
The expertise reversal effect can be related to a long history of studies in aptitude-
treatment interactions (ATIs) that occur when different treatments result in differ-
ential learning rates and outcomes depending on student aptitudes (e.g. Cronbach, 
1967; Cronbach & Snow, 1977; Lohman, 1986; Mayer, Stiehl, & Greeno1975; 
Shute & Gluck, 1996; Snow, 1989, 1994; Snow & Lohman, 1984). In those studies, 
the concept of aptitude was broadly used as any learner characteristics such as 
knowledge, skills, learning styles or personality characteristic that influence learn-
ing processes.
Interactions between prior knowledge or achievement in a domain and instruc-
tional treatments have been considered to be a form of an ATI. Stable interactions 
have been found for several forms of instructional support in programmed learning. 
A consistent pattern of results indicated that higher levels of learner prior achieve-
ment or familiarity with a domain required lower levels of instructional support and 
structure and vice versa (Tobias, 1976, 1987, 1988, 1989), a result in line with the 
expertise reversal effect. However, in ATI research, instructional support was con-
sidered in a narrow sense, mostly as assistance in eliciting responses and providing 
feedback. In the ATI approach in general, cognitive processes were little considered 
when either measuring aptitudes using traditional psychometric test batteries or 
selecting instructional procedures (Federico, 1980).
Conditions of Applicability of the Expertise Reversal Effect
Most of the initial studies of the expertise reversal effect within a cognitive load 
framework were conducted as longitudinal studies with novice learners gradually 
trained to eventually become more expert in specific task domains, in controlled labo-
ratory settings with materials from technical domains (Kalyuga et al., 1998, 2000, 
Kalyuga, Chandler, & Sweller, 2001). Subsequently, interactions between different 
instructional methods and levels of learner expertise have been found in a wide variety 

168
12 The Expertise Reversal Effect
of instructional contexts including a large range of instructional materials in mathematics, 
science, engineering, programming, accountancy, ESL, literature, management and 
social psychology. Participants ranged from primary school to university, in experi-
ments that were designed as either longitudinal or cross-sectional studies. Expert-
novice differences were established using a range of techniques from extended 
objective pre-tests of knowledge to rough estimates based on years of schooling. The 
effect seems to be very robust.
Despite the robustness of the effect, there is one condition of applicability com-
mon to all extraneous cognitive load effects. For all cognitive load effects associated 
with extraneous cognitive load, sufficiently high levels of element interactivity (or 
intrinsic cognitive load) in learning material is an essential condition of applicability 
of the expertise reversal effect. According to the element interactivity effect (see 
Chapter 15), instructional materials with low levels of element interactivity and con-
sequently, low intrinsic cognitive load, are unlikely to demonstrate any significant 
expert–novice differences in the effectiveness of different instructional methods. The 
important issue is whether some of the methods or materials impose excessive levels 
of extraneous load beyond the cognitive capacity of learners, either novices or 
experts. Without a high intrinsic cognitive load, extraneous cognitive load effects will 
not be obtained. Results from the following two studies illustrate this issue well.
Kalyuga, Chandler, and Sweller (2001) compared worked examples-based 
instruction on how to construct switching equations for relay circuits with an 
exploratory learning environment. When the knowledge level of trainees was raised 
as a consequence of specifically designed training sessions, the exploratory group 
demonstrated better results than the worked examples group. Subjective measures 
of mental effort supported the cognitive load interpretation of the effect. However, 
these results were obtained only for relatively complex tasks with high levels of 
element interactivity. In that study, two levels of tasks were involved: simple tasks 
with few input elements and a very limited number of possible options to explore, 
and complex tasks with numerous options to explore. There were no differences 
between the instructional methods for the simple tasks.
At the other end of the complexity spectrum, excessively high levels of element 
interactivity also may prevent the occurrence of the expertise reversal effect. When 
dealing with very complex materials, even knowledgeable learners may experience 
excessively high levels of intrinsic cognitive load. For example, Lee et al. (2006) 
demonstrated an expertise reversal effect (see above) but only with interactive simula-
tions that had manageable levels of intrinsic cognitive load, at least for some learners. 
For higher complexity materials, no expertise reversal effect was demonstrated.
Instructional Implications
The main instructional implication of the expertise reversal effect is the need to 
tailor instructional methods to levels of learner expertise as it changes during 
learning. In order to minimise extraneous cognitive load in learning, detailed, direct  

169
Conclusions
instructional support should be provided to novice learners, preferably, in integrated 
or dual-modality formats. At intermediate levels of expertise, a mix of direct 
instruction and problem-solving practice with reduced support may be optimal for 
learning. For advanced learners at higher levels of expertise, minimally guided 
problem-solving tasks should provide cognitively optimal instructional methods. 
Changes in the learner knowledge base need to be dynamically monitored and spe-
cific instructional techniques and procedures tailored accordingly.
A simple approach to such tailoring, suggested by researchers within the ATIs 
framework, was to assign students to specific treatments and levels of instructional 
support based on measures of their prior achievement taken before the learning 
session (Tennyson, 1975; Tobias, 1976). A more advanced approach needs to be 
based on continuously monitoring learning behaviour and appropriately refining 
instructional procedures. This approach may be combined with prior achievement 
measures for the initial selection of optimal instructional methods (Federico (1999). 
Such an adaptation strategy combining prior achievement measures and continuous 
monitoring has been realised within the cognitive load theory framework based on 
the expertise reversal effect (Kalyuga, 2006a; Kalyuga & Sweller, 2004, 2005; 
Salden, Paas, Broers, & van Merriënboer, 2004; Salden, Paas, & van Merriënboer, 
2006b; van Merriënboer, Kirschner, & Kester, 2003; van Merriënboer & Sweller, 
2005; see the following chapter for adaptive fading procedures).
This adaptation strategy has been primarily implemented in system-controlled 
environments that dynamically select an instructional method that is most appropri-
ate for the current level of learner expertise. Even though a learner-controlled 
approach has been long considered as an alternative to system-controlled tailoring 
of instruction (e.g. Merrill, 1975), empirical findings have been more negative 
rather than positive (Chung & Reigeluth, 1992; Niemiec, Sikorski, & Walberg, 
1996; Steinberg, 1977, 1989). According to cognitive load theory, since the effec-
tiveness of learner control depends on students’ ability to select appropriate learn-
ing strategies on their own, learners should have control over instructional methods 
only when they have sufficient knowledge in the domain to understand the conse-
quences of their choice. Less experienced learners may be easily overloaded both 
by the need to select a task and by the consequences of an inappropriate selection. 
Novices require appropriate instructional support. The cognitive load effects indi-
cate the nature of that support.
Conclusions
Frequently, we automatically assume that if instructional techniques and procedures 
work well for novice learners, they should also work for more experienced learners 
or, at least, not have negative consequences. Counter to this expectation, the theoretical 
considerations and the available experimental evidence provided by cognitive load 
theory indicates that instructional methods effective for novices may indeed inhibit 
learning for more experienced learners (Kalyuga, 2007; Kalyuga & Renkl, 2010).

170
12 The Expertise Reversal Effect
Within the cognitive load framework, the expertise reversal effect is explained 
by the need to provide novices with information that is essential for their under-
standing and in the case of experts, to unnecessarily process that same information 
that is redundant for more knowledgeable learners. The need for experts to establish 
connections between elements of presented information and their existing knowl-
edge base can interfere with learning. Where learner knowledge is unavailable as 
may occur for novices, instruction should compensate for the deficiency. Where 
learner knowledge is available as may occur for more expert learners, the elimina-
tion of redundant information allows learners to take advantage of their knowledge 
base in the most efficient way.
This chapter described empirical findings associated with the expertise reversal 
effect providing general implications for the design of instructional systems tailored 
to pre-existing learner knowledge. Adaptive learning environments that dynamically 
tailor instructional methods to changing levels of learner expertise have the best 
potential for optimising cognitive load based on the expertise reversal effect.  
A general strategy of gradually decreasing the degree of instructional guidance as 
the level of learner expertise increases may be implemented by using a completion 
strategy (van Merriënboer, 1990; van Merriënboer & Paas, 1990; see Chapter 8 for 
more details) or faded worked examples (Renkl, 1997; Renkl & Atkinson, 2003; 
Renkl, Atkinson, Maier, & Staley, 2002; see Chapter 13). Recent studies of rapid 
diagnostic assessment techniques (Kalyuga, 2006c, 2008b; Kalyuga & Sweller, 
2004, 2005) may also offer suitable real-time measures of expertise with sufficient 
diagnostic power to tailor instructional procedures to learner knowledge levels. 
Some recent experimental attempts at implementing these techniques in adaptive 
learning environments using faded worked examples will be considered in the fol-
lowing chapter.

171
According to the expertise reversal effect described in Chapter 12, instructional 
designs and techniques that are relatively effective for novice learners can lose their 
effectiveness and even have negative consequences with increasing levels of exper-
tise. As a result, instructional methods including the amount of instructional guid-
ance provided to learners should be dynamically tailored to changing levels of 
learner expertise in a particular area or domain.
While levels of expertise interact with a wide range of cognitive load effects to 
generate the expertise reversal effect, as discussed in Chapter 12, expertise is particu-
larly important to the worked example effect given its significance as an instructional 
tool for novice learners. Multiple research studies have demonstrated that for novice 
learners, especially during the initial stages of skill acquisition, worked examples rep-
resent a very efficient form of instruction (see Chapter 8 for a discussion of the worked 
example effect). They minimise use of the randomness as genesis principle, maximise 
use of the borrowing and reorganising principle and so reduce the extraneous interact-
ing elements associated with problem solving resulting in a reduced working memory 
load as required by the narrow limits of change principle. As a consequence, informa-
tion can be readily transferred to the long-term memory store and used by the environ-
mental organising and linking principle to solve subsequent problems.
However, for more experienced learners, practice at problem solving without the 
assistance of worked examples is likely to be superior during later phases of skill 
acquisition. Worked examples are likely to be less effective for more knowledge-
able learners because integrating the detailed instructional guidance of the sort 
provided by worked examples with knowledge structures already available in a 
learner’s long-term memory may require additional cognitive resources and thus 
impose an unnecessary cognitive load. Instructional formats that provide reduced 
guidance or minimal support, such as problem-solving practice or exploratory 
learning environments, may be more cognitively efficient for relatively advanced 
learners. Worked examples and other forms of guidance, important for novices, 
may become redundant and so increase extraneous cognitive load as levels of 
expertise increase. If worked examples are redundant for more knowledgeable 
learners, the cognitive procedures associated with redundancy can be expected to 
come into play. Processing redundant elements may increase working memory load 
as indicated by the narrow limits of change principle. It is unlikely to result in

13 The Guidance Fading Effect
additional information transferring to the long-term memory store via the borrowing 
and reorganising principle because the information store already contains the relevant 
information. It follows that procedures designed to effectively structure the transi-
tion from worked example-based instruction during the early stages of learning to 
problem-solving practice as learners acquire more expertise in the task domain 
becomes an important research and practical question.
One possible means of a smooth transition from worked examples to problem-
solving practice is the use of completion tasks (van Merriënboer, 1990; van 
Merriënboer, Kirschner, & Kester, 2003; see Chapter 8 for an overview of the tech-
nique). A completion task provides a problem statement, a partially worked-out solu-
tion procedure, with learners required to complete the solution. Completion problems 
effectively combine a worked example with problem solving within one task. Faded 
worked examples use completion problems as a solution to the issue of transition 
from less to more expert learners. The instructional strategy is based on gradually 
decreasing the levels of instructional guidance as levels of learner expertise increase 
(Atkinson, Derry, Renkl, & Wortham, 2000 ; Renkl, 1997; Renkl, Atkinson, & Maier, 
2000). With this instructional method, worked examples are gradually faded as 
learner knowledge increases. Worked-out steps provided by the instructor are pro-
gressively replaced with problem-solving steps for learners to complete. Faded 
worked examples thus, in effect, represent a coordinated series of completion prob-
lems in which early problems are presented as full worked examples with successive 
problems requiring learners to complete an increasing number of steps until eventu-
ally, full problems with no steps completed by the instructor are presented.
The fading effect is predicated on the assumption that by gradually decreasing 
problem-solving guidance and increasing problem-solving demands with increases 
in expertise, learners will retain sufficient working memory capacity to deal with 
the increasing demands. As learner expertise increases, knowledge held in long-
term memory can be used to decrease the demands on working memory. The freed 
working memory resources instead can be used to engage in problem solving.
The guidance fading procedure can be contrasted with traditional example–
problem pairs (see Chapter 8). While the use of such pairs is highly effective and 
relatively simple to implement, example–problem pairs ignore the consequences of 
changes in levels of expertise as exemplified by the expertise reversal effect. Based 
on the expertise reversal effect, it can be hypothesised that continuing to provide 
worked examples after levels of expertise have increased can result in redundancy 
and an increased extraneous cognitive load compared to a fading procedure.
Empirical Evidence for the Guidance Fading Effect
The guidance fading effect is demonstrated by enhanced learning due to the use 
of gradually faded worked examples instead of a consistent use of worked exam-
ples, problems or worked example–problem pairs. This section reviews empirical 
evidence for the effect and its instructional implications.

173
Empirical Evidence for the Guidance Fading Effect
Effects of Fading Worked-Out Solution Steps
As intrinsic load gradually decreases when learners acquire more experience in 
a task domain, a gradual increase in the proportion of time allocated to problem-
solving practice is possible without an excessive load. An introduction of 
problem-solving steps can be accomplished in a graduated manner. Initially, 
after a complete example is presented, an example can be provided in which a 
single solution step is omitted with learners required to provide that step them-
selves. For subsequent stages, the number of steps learners must complete by 
themselves without explicit guidance can be increased until only a problem 
statement is left (Renkl & Atkinson, 2003) with learners required to complete all 
steps. Compared to traditional example–problem pairs, fading can be expected 
to reduce cognitive load and, as a result, enhance learning. For instance, after 
seeing a full worked example, the learner only is required to complete a single 
step on the next problem rather than search for a solution to the whole problem.
Two types of fading procedures have been proposed. In backward fading, the first 
learning task is presented as a completely worked-out example, the second task is 
presented with the solution to the last step omitted, the third task with the solutions 
to the last two steps omitted, etc. For instance, the previously used (Chapter 8) 
example of a completion strategy for a simple two-step problem can be used to rep-
resent an example of the second task in a backward-fading procedure, as follows:
Make a the subject of the equation (a + b)/c = d.

In contrast to this backward-fading procedure, in a forward-fading proce-
dure, the first learning task is also presented as a completely worked-out 
example, followed by the second task with the solution to the first step omitted, 
the third task with the solutions to the first two steps omitted, etc. Using the 
above algebra example, the second task in a forward-fading procedure requires 
learners to provide a solution to the first step with the last step provided by the 
instructor, as follows:
Make a the subject of the equation (a + b)/c = d.

13 The Guidance Fading Effect
A backward-fading procedure was used with the first task as a completely worked-out 
example, the second task with the last solution step omitted, the third task with the 
last two steps omitted, etc. In a delayed post-test conducted 2 days after tuition, the 
fading group outperformed the example–problem pairs group in near transfer perfor-
mance. The results were replicated with fading again proving superior to example–
problem pairs in a follow-up laboratory-based experiment with psychology 
university students learning probability calculation procedures. This follow-up 
experiment used a  forward-fading procedure that omitted guidance for the first solu-
tion step initially, then omitted the first two steps, etc. The third experiment, again 
laboratory-based using university educational psychology students, compared tradi-
tional example–problem pairs with two alternative conditions, one backward fading 
and the other forward fading. The results indicated a positive effect of fading on a 
near transfer post-test for both backward and forward fading. In addition, the backward-
fading condition also was superior on a far transfer post-test. The backward-fading 
condition was generally more efficient than forward fading, as learners presented 
backward fading also required less time to study the examples. From a cognitive 
load perspective, the backward-fading condition whereby the learner supplies the 
final problem-solving step may impose a lower cognitive load than the forward-
fading condition where the learner supplies the first problem-solving step, a step 
often a critical step in the overall solution (see Ayres & Sweller, 1990).
However, Renkl, Atkinson, and Grobe (2004) demonstrated that the position of 
the faded steps did not actually influence how much was learned about each step. 
Students learned most about those problem-solving steps that were faded irrespec-
tive of whether backward or forward fading was used. A follow-up experiment 
using think-aloud protocols generated by the learners demonstrated that fading was 
associated with fewer unproductive learning events, thus explaining better learning 
outcomes. Accordingly, there may not be a universal recommendation for sequenc-
ing the fading procedure. The selection of an appropriate fading procedure and a 
decision about which type of solution step should be faded first may depend largely 
on specific structures and content of the material to be learned.
In additional work, Renkl and Atkinson (2001) investigated the efficiency of 
self-explanation prompts at the faded steps (see Chapter 8 for details about the self-
explanation technique). At each worked-out step, the university students learning 
the probability calculation procedures were asked to identify which probability rule 
had been applied. Two backward-fading groups with and without self-explanation 
prompts were compared, and the results indicated strong advantages associated 
with self-explanation prompts on both near and far transfer post-tests.
Knowledge-Dependent Dynamic Provision of Guidance
Based on the expertise reversal effect, an appropriate sequencing of learning tasks 
with decreased guidance as expertise increases is important. Accordingly, tasks that 

175
Empirical Evidence for the Guidance Fading Effect
provide optimal levels of instructional guidance for novice learners may not be optimal 
for more experienced learners. These learners have already acquired sufficient 
knowledge so additional support provided through instructional guidance may be 
redundant, counterproductive and inhibit rather than facilitate further learning.
Reisslein (2005) examined the pace of transitioning from worked examples to 
independent problem solving for university engineering students with different 
levels of prior knowledge. In the immediate transitioning condition, learners prac-
tised problems immediately after an introduction. In the fast fading condition, 
worked-out solution steps were faded at a rate of one step with each example. In 
the slow fading condition, the rate was one step for every second example. The 
results of the retention post-test indicated significant interactions between levels of 
learner prior knowledge and the pace of transitioning. More knowledgeable learn-
ers performed significantly better in the fast and immediate transitioning groups 
than in the slow transitioning group. Worked examples might have been redundant 
for these learners. On the other hand, learners with low levels of prior knowledge 
who required more detailed guidance benefited more from the slow transitioning 
condition than from the immediate or fast transitioning conditions.
As was mentioned in Chapter 12, Nückles, Hübner, Dümer, and Renkl (2010) 
demonstrated an expertise reversal effect based on instructional support for writing 
learning journals in which students reflected on the previously studied material. 
Support was provided in the form of prompts to apply appropriate learning strate-
gies. At the beginning of the term, the group that received prompts applied 
more strategies in their learning journals and learned more than the no-prompts 
group. At the end of the term, the prompts group learned less than the no-prompts group. 
In order to avoid these negative long-term effects of prompts, a gradual and adap-
tive fading of the prompts was introduced in the second experiment. In the experi-
mental group, each of the presented prompts was faded out as soon as a student 
applied the prompted strategy in a satisfactory manner. In the control group, the 
prompts were presented permanently. The results showed that, over the course of 
the term, the fading group applied increasingly more cognitive strategies, while the 
permanent prompts group applied increasingly fewer cognitive strategies. At the 
end of term, the permanent prompts group showed substantially lower learning 
outcomes than the fading group. At the beginning of the term, the prompts success-
fully facilitated the application of beneficial strategies. However, as the students 
became more skilled in journal writing, the external guidance by prompts became 
redundant and, thus, caused an extraneous load. Accordingly, a gradual fading-out 
of the prompts in line with the learner’s growing level of expertise was effective in 
alleviating possible negative effects of instructional support.
Kester and Kirschner (2009)  investigated whether fading conceptual and strategic 
support in a problem solving domain affected accuracy of hypertext navigation and 
problem performance in an e-learning environment. The research demonstrated that 
fading support during practice as a function of increasing levels of learner expertise 
helped learners to navigate more accurately during practice as compared to learners 
receiving full support or no support during practice.

176
13 The Guidance Fading Effect
Thus, in these studies, novice learners benefited most from well-guided, slow-paced 
instructional procedures that reduced extraneous cognitive load. For more experi-
enced learners, studying redundant worked-out steps and integrating them with 
available knowledge that provided essentially the same guidance imposed an 
unnecessary extraneous cognitive load. These experienced learners were able to use 
their knowledge base to guide the learning process. They did not require external 
guidance and therefore benefited more from minimally guided instruction.
The Effect of a Gradual Change in Levels of Support  
Using Computer-Based Tutors
In intelligent tutoring systems (e.g. Anderson, Corbett, Koedinger, & Pelletier, 
1995), learning by problem solving is usually supported by providing explicit sub-
goals, immediate feedback, hints, dynamic evaluation of student progress and 
appropriate remedial problems. Because of this comprehensive instructional sup-
port that is embedded into most cognitive tutors, their reported instructional effec-
tiveness could, in fact, be due to a version of the worked example effect. A worked 
example provides the ultimate example of guidance and support.
Renkl, Schwonke, Wittwer, Krieg, Aleven, and Salden (2007) conducted a study 
designed to compare a ‘standard’ problem-based tutor in circle geometry that also 
included self-explanation prompts, with an example-enriched tutor based on faded 
worked examples. The results of the first experiment indicated no differences in 
conceptual knowledge acquisition and transfer performance; however, lower 
instruction time and higher efficiency indicators were obtained for the example-
enriched tutor. In a follow-up study that used a modified tutor with an improved 
introduction and individual learning sessions, higher post-test conceptual knowl-
edge scores, lower instruction times and higher efficiency indicators for the faded 
example-enriched tutor were obtained. The participants in the faded example-
enriched group made many errors at the beginning of the learning phase but exhibited 
a rapid catch-up. They also expressed more principle-based self-explanations. 
In comparison, the participants in the problem group uttered more superficial pro-
cedure-based self-explanations. Integrating intelligent cognitive tutors with faded 
example-based learning could be an effective instructional approach to developing 
learner expertise.
Salden, Aleven, Schwonke, and Renkl (2010)  conducted an experimental study 
designed to investigate if learners’ current skill levels determined by their self-
explanation performance while studying examples and by their problem-solving 
performance could be used to determine an appropriate degree of guidance. A fad-
ing approach to structuring the transition from examples to problem solving that 
was adapted to the skill levels of individual learners was expected to be more effec-
tive than a predetermined fading approach. Such an individualised fading procedure 
(adaptive fading) was compared to a fixed procedure (fixed fading), and to a stan-
dard tutored problem-solving condition (problem solving) using high school students 

177
Empirical Evidence for the Guidance Fading Effect
studying geometry lessons provided by the Cognitive Tutor. The results of the 
laboratory-based study showed that the adaptive fading procedure resulted in higher 
performance scores on the immediate post-test and a post-test delayed by a week. 
Another classroom-based study replicated these results on the delayed post-test 
with non-significant differences on the immediate post-test. Thus, these experi-
ments provided evidence of better learning outcomes resulting from adaptive fading 
than from fixed fading or problem solving.
Applying Rapid Assessment Techniques to the Design  
of Adaptive Fading Procedures
There is considerable work that has been carried out using adaptive fading in con-
texts other than use of the cognitive tutor. That work is discussed next.
Rapid online evaluation of levels of expertise. The quality of adaptive fading  
procedures is likely to depend significantly on the accuracy of information about 
current levels of learner knowledge and skills. Knowing when to fade guidance 
depends on accurate information concerning learner knowledge levels. Traditional 
tests may not be sufficiently precise or timely to maximise the benefits of fading. 
Diagnosing levels of learner expertise rapidly and in real time is important for 
the development of dynamic, learner-tailored learning environments in general, 
and implementing fading procedures in particular. This section reviews a series 
of studies aimed at developing rapid diagnostic assessment methods that are 
directly based on characteristics of our cognitive architecture described in Part II 
of this book.
The knowledge base in long-term memory heavily determines what informa-
tion working memory processes and how it is processed. Information in long-
term memory transforms the characteristics of working memory and so long-term 
memory defines the effective processing capacity and the current content of 
working memory during knowledge-based cognitive processes. Accordingly, 
evaluating the content of long-term memory should provide a measure of levels 
of learner expertise. If such an evaluation can be conducted rapidly, it may be 
suitable as a formative evaluation technique that can be used to appropriately 
govern a fading procedure.
We know, based on the early work of De Groot (1965) and on subsequent work 
(see Chapter 2), that expertise in a domain is determined by the extent to which 
learners have acquired schemas held in long-term memory that allow them to rec-
ognise problem states and the best moves associated with each state. It would be 
beneficial to devise techniques that assess such learner knowledge directly. The 
techniques need to be sufficiently rapid to provide us with information allowing us 
to fade guidance at an appropriate time. De Groot’s (1965) work has potential in 
this regard. Based on his work, we know that expert problem solvers can recognise 
problem states and the best moves associated with each state. It may be possible to 
devise a test intended to assess how learners approach briefly presented memory 

178
13 The Guidance Fading Effect
tasks similar to those used by De Groot. More expert-level learners should be able 
to retrieve appropriate higher-level schemas and immediately place a problem and 
its solution within their well-structured knowledge base. On the other hand, novices, 
not possessing such schemas may only identify random, lower-level components of 
the solution steps. In this manner, the presence or absence of an organised knowl-
edge base in long-term memory may possibly be used as the main factor determin-
ing differences between more and less expert problem solvers.
Kalyuga and Sweller (2004) attempted to devise a rapid assessment procedure 
based on de Groot’s findings. They suggested it may be possible to rapidly assess 
the contents of long-term memory using a ‘first-step’ diagnostic assessment proce-
dure according to which learners are presented with selected problems for a limited 
time and asked to indicate their first step towards solution of each problem. Based 
on their schemas, more experienced learners are expected to rapidly indicate more 
advanced steps of the solution and skip some intermediate steps. Novices may only 
be able to indicate isolated, single, random steps. For example, if asked to indicate 
their first step towards the solution of the equation 4x = 5, learners who are expe-
rienced in solving such equations (experts), might immediately produce the final 
answer (x = 5/4) as their first step. Less experienced but still knowledgeable stu-
dents (intermediates) might provide the first step of the standard solution procedure 
that requires dividing both sides of the equation by 4 (4x/4 = 5/4), while students 
without any knowledge of the solution procedure (novices) may attempt a random 
step using a trial-and-error method. Different first steps may indicate different lev-
els of expertise much more rapidly than conventional tests. This technique was vali-
dated in a series of studies using algebra, coordinate geometry, and arithmetic word 
problems by demonstrating high correlation levels between the results of the rapid 
tasks and traditional measures of knowledge that required students to provide the 
entire solution. Importantly, rapid tests could reduce testing times by up to a factor 
of 5 (Kalyuga, 2006a; Kalyuga & Sweller, 2004).
An alternative rapid assessment method is available that may be more suitable 
for online learning environments. Instead of generating the first steps themselves, 
learners can be presented with a series of potential, possible steps at various stages 
of the solution procedure and asked to rapidly verify the validity of these steps. This 
method may be useful in relatively poorly specified domains with many different 
possible solution paths. This rapid verification procedure was first used with sen-
tence comprehension tasks (Kalyuga, 2006b ) in which a sequence of sentences that 
gradually increased in complexity was displayed. For example, simple, composite 
and multiple-embedded sentences increase in complexity. Each sentence was dis-
played for a limited time, followed by a series of simple statements related to the 
content of the corresponding sentence. Students were asked to rapidly verify the 
correctness of each statement by clicking on the buttons ‘Right’, ‘Wrong’ or ‘Don’t 
know’ underneath the statement on the computer screen. For example, after reading 
the sentence, ‘The artist, who performed for the crowd that gathered to enjoy the 
show, left’, students were briefly showed the following statements one at a time for 
rapid verification: ‘the artist left’; ‘the artist enjoyed the show’; ‘the crowd gathered 
for the show’; ‘the crowd left’.

Empirical Evidence for the Guidance Fading Effect
Subsequently, the method was also used in the domains of kinematics and 
mathematics. In these domains, diagrammatic representations of selected potential 
solution steps were presented to students for rapid verification. Both correct and 
incorrect solution steps were used. These rapid tests demonstrated high levels of 
correlation with problem-solving scores obtained from the analyses of video 
records and concurrent verbal reports of students’ problem-solving performance 
(Kalyuga, 2008b).
Expertise-based adaptive fading instruction. The above-mentioned studies suggest 
a sufficiently high degree of concurrent validity for the rapid assessment methods 
to warrant their implementation in adaptive fading procedures. The first-step 
assessment method was used to design a gradual transition from worked examples 
to unguided problem-solving practice. A computer-based tutor for secondary 
school students solving elementary algebra equations was used (Kalyuga & 
Sweller, 2004). This tutor and several subsequent tutors were designed to produce 
a series of faded worked examples. The initial allocation of learners to appropriate 
stages of fading was based on the outcomes of initial, rapid, first-step diagnostic 
pretests (see the example above). A learner progressing through the stages was 
monitored by rapid diagnostic probes, and instruction was tailored according to 
changing levels of expertise.
Learners who were classified as novices based on the initial pretest studied a 
series of fully worked-out examples, each followed by a similar problem-solving 
exercise. Depending on the outcome of a diagnostic test at the end of this phase, 
additional worked examples were provided if necessary before learners proceeded 
to the next stage after successfully completing the phase-exit rapid test. The second 
stage contained backward faded completion problems in which learners were 
asked to complete the last step themselves. At each of the following stages, 
reduced instructional guidance was provided to learners by eliminating solution 
explanations of progressively more procedural steps. The final stage contained 
only problem-solving exercises without any explanations provided. A flow chart of 
the procedure is represented in Fig. 13.1. This learner-adapted tutor resulted in 
significantly better knowledge gains as measured by differences between post-
instruction and pre-instruction test scores than a non-adapted tutor in which stu-
dents were required to study the whole set of worked examples and example–problem 
pairs available in the tutorial without fading.
In another study with similar materials (Kalyuga & Sweller, 2005), the rapid 
first-step measure of expertise was combined with measures of cognitive load 
using subjective ratings of task difficulty. It was assumed that expertise is associ-
ated not only with higher levels of performance but also with lower levels of cogni-
tive load, as experts’ available knowledge structures in long-term memory could 
significantly reduce working memory demands, as specified by the environmental 
organising and linking principle. Therefore, combining both measures could 
produce a good indicator of learner expertise in a domain. In contrast to the tradi-
tional ‘deviation model’ (Hoffman and Schraw, 2010) definition of instructional 
efficiency as the difference between standardised scores for performance and 
mental effort ratings (Paas & van Merriënboer, 1993; Paas, Tuovinen, Tabbers, & van 

180
13 The Guidance Fading Effect
Gerven, 2003), efficiency was defined as a ratio of the current level of performance to 
the current level of cognitive load, called a ‘likelihood model’ by Hoffman and 
Schraw (see Chapter 6). This definition corresponds more closely to the common 
idea of efficiency as the relative cost of achieving a result. This indicator of cogni-
tive efficiency was used for the initial selection of appropriate levels of instructional

guidance, as well as for ongoing monitoring of learner progress and tailoring the 
fading procedure to changing levels of learner expertise. Results indicated that the 
learner-adapted instructional condition significantly outperformed the non-adapted 
group on both knowledge and efficiency gains.
Kalyuga (2006a) compared non-adapted instruction in the area of vector addi-
tion motion problems in kinematics for high school students with two learner-
adapted instructional procedures, one of which was based on rapid verification 
performance tests as described above and another one that was based on efficiency 
indicators. Both adaptive conditions outperformed the non-adapted group on a 
number of dependent variables such as cognitive load ratings, instruction time and 
instructional efficiency. However, there were no significant differences between the 
two adaptation procedures on any of the dependent variables.
Similar results have been obtained in research on dynamic adaptation of learn-
ing task selection procedures in which the difficulty of learning tasks presented to 
students was determined by test results. Camp, Paas, Rikers, and van Merriënboer 
(2001)  and Salden, Paas, Broers, and van Merriënboer (2004) investigated the use 
of test results to determine levels of learner expertise during air traffic control 
training. Unlike the previous studies that used rapid tests to determine levels of 
guidance, these studies were primarily concerned with gradual increases in task 
difficulty rather than with fading the levels of instructional support. Also, these 
studies used different performance assessment methods, definitions of instruc-
tional efficiency, and task selection algorithms to the ones described above. 
Nevertheless, learner-adapted conditions were superior to non-adapted formats in 
all of the studies. Salden, Paas, and van Merriënboer (2006a) also demonstrated 
that learner-adapted approaches to selecting learning tasks were superior to non-
adapted formats.
Conditions of Applicability of the Fading Effect
Firstly, as is common for all cognitive load effects, high levels of intrinsic cognitive 
load are essential to the fading effect. It is unreasonable to expect any significant 
effect of fading for instructional materials that do not impose a sufficiently high 
level of intrinsic cognitive load, and therefore are relatively easy to learn even with 
abrupt transitions from examples to problem-solving exercises.
Secondly, although the fading effect is a direct consequence of the expertise 
reversal effect, levels of expertise are just as important to the fading effect as to 
most other cognitive load effects. Faded worked examples can be effective for 
learners at specific levels of prior knowledge and not optimal for other learners. For 
example, as was previously mentioned in this chapter, gradual transitioning proce-
dures with slowly decreasing levels of guidance are likely to benefit most novice 
learners. Relatively more knowledgeable learners might benefit from more rapid 
transitioning procedures or from immediately beginning to practice problems after 
an introduction to a topic area, since detailed guidance during problem solving may 
be redundant for these learners (Reisslein, 2005).

182
13 The Guidance Fading Effect
Instructional Implications
As was mentioned in the previous chapter, a major instructional implication of the 
expertise reversal effect is the need to dynamically tailor instructional methods and 
levels of instructional guidance to changing levels of learner expertise during a 
learning session. According to the expertise reversal effect, appropriate instruc-
tional guidance needs to be presented at the right time, and removed in a timely 
fashion as learners gradually gain expertise. Detailed instructional support should 
be provided to novice learners as a substitute for missing knowledge structures. At 
higher levels of expertise, problem-solving practice using knowledge held in long-
term memory should be the prevailing instructional method. At intermediate levels 
of expertise, an optimal mix of direct external guidance and problem-solving prac-
tice should be used. It can, of course, be a challenging task to establish the optimal 
mix and implement the corresponding transition procedures. Nevertheless, while 
challenging, the results of the experiments described in this chapter suggest it is 
worth the effort.
Conclusions
The instructional strategy of gradually decreasing the level of instructional guid-
ance as levels of learner expertise increase is an implication of the expertise reversal 
effect. The most obvious instructional strategy that flows from the expertise rever-
sal effect is the use of faded worked examples. This technique gradually fades 
worked-out steps to be replaced with problem solving sub-tasks as levels of learner 
expertise increase. The gradual reduction of instructional guidance as levels of 
learner expertise increase has proved to be a more effective instructional procedure 
than abrupt switches from worked examples to problems. The next step in this line 
of research has been the development of adaptive fading methods that dynamically 
tailor the rates of transition from worked examples to problems depending on cur-
rent levels of learner expertise.
Research into adaptive fading methods is still in its early stages and the number 
of studies is limited. However, the available research has already demonstrated that 
adaptive fading procedures can improve learning outcomes with significant impacts 
on the acquisition of basic knowledge and skills for novice learners as well as more 
strategic knowledge and transfer capabilities for more advanced learners. Recent 
studies into rapid diagnostic assessment methods combined with advances in mea-
sures of cognitive load and instructional efficiency may offer appropriate, real-time 
diagnostic tools for the dynamic adaptation of fading techniques. This research area 
currently is very active.

183
According to the expertise reversal effect (Chapter 12) during the initial phases 
of skill acquisition, worked examples (Chapter 8) represent an efficient form of 
instruction, while problem-solving practice is superior during later phases of skill 
acquisition. This reversal suggests that as levels of expertise increase, levels of 
instructional guidance should decrease. Completion tasks (Chapter 8) and faded 
worked examples (Chapter 13) were suggested as instructional procedures that 
can be used to gradually decrease the levels of guidance. Empirical evidence has 
indicated that these methods are a more effective and efficient means for a 
smooth transition from initial instruction based on worked examples to later 
problem-solving practice. This chapter reviews evidence supporting an alterna-
tive to studying worked examples or problem-solving practice for more knowl-
edgeable learners. The method is based on imagining activities, procedures, or 
concepts, for example, imagining a problem solution provided in a recently 
­studied worked example. Imagining is defined as the mental reproduction of a 
procedure or a concept.
In addition, we will discuss the self-explanation effect in this chapter. While the 
self-explanation effect, unlike the other effects discussed in this book, was neither 
initiated nor developed within a cognitive load theory framework, it is closely 
related to the imagination effect and can be explained using cognitive load theory 
concepts. Both effects differ from the other effects discussed in this book in that 
they do not rely on altering the instructional materials presented to learners. Instead, 
they rely on encouraging learners to engage in appropriate mental processes that 
may differ from the ones that they would normally use.
The Imagination Effect
Within a cognitive load theoretical framework, the imagination technique was first 
investigated by Cooper, Tindall-Ford, Chandler, and Sweller (2001) who asked 
­students to imagine the computer-based instructional procedures on how to use a 
spreadsheet application instead of studying worked examples. The worked examples

consisted of a set of diagrams with embedded textual explanations of sequential 
steps. After studying a worked example on the screen, students were instructed to 
turn away and try to imagine the steps involved in the procedure. The study demon-
strated that instructing learners to imagine a previously studied worked-out solution 
path produced better learning outcomes than studying the same worked example 
again. However, the imagining technique was beneficial only for more knowledge-
able learners. The results indicated that the imagining technique was not useful for 
low-knowledge students because of the heavy working memory load it generated for 
these learners.
In order to imagine a procedure or concept, learners must be able to process that 
procedure or concept in working memory. The act of processing in working ­memory 
should assist in transfer to the long-term memory store, but since working 
memory is limited in accordance with the narrow limits of change principle, for 
novices, imagining a procedure or concept may be difficult or impossible, render-
ing imagination instructions relatively ineffective. Therefore, conventional instruc-
tions to study the material are superior for novices because studying, in accord with 
the borrowing and reorganising principle, can facilitate schema construction. For 
­novice learners in a domain, studying rather than imagining a worked example may 
provide more effective guidance. In order to imagine a procedure, the interacting 
elements that constitute that procedure must be processed in working memory. For 
a novice, the number of interacting elements may exceed working memory 
­capacity, rendering an imagination procedure ineffective. The interacting elements 
may best be handled by studying a worked example rather than attempting to imag-
ine it, resulting in a superiority of study over imagination instructions.
In contrast, more experienced learners may have already acquired sufficient 
task-relevant schematic knowledge held in the long-term store and available for 
use according to the environmental organising and linking principle. This prin-
ciple allows large amounts of familiar information to be processed in working 
memory, and so imagining may be feasible for more expert learners while not 
feasible for novices. While novices need to study worked examples, continuing 
to do so may constitute a redundant activity for more experienced learners. They 
already have appropriate prerequisite schemas in long-term memory to incorpo-
rate the interacting elements. Imagining procedures provides additional practice 
that can lead to schema automation. From these results, it follows that with 
increasing levels of expertise, studying worked examples should be replaced by 
imagining those examples.
Switching from studying worked examples to imagining problem solutions may 
be as effective or even more effective as expertise increases than switching from 
studying worked examples to solving problems via faded worked examples. The 
imagination effect occurs when imagining a procedure or concept results in more 
learning than studying the same procedure or concept.
From a theoretical perspective, the imagination effect occurs because imagination 
instructions explicitly direct limited working memory resources to all of the interact-
ing elements that constitute intrinsic cognitive load. Unnecessarily processing a 
worked example will result in processing elements that are extraneous to learning. 

185
The Imagination Effect Prior to Cognitive Load Theory Research 
For example, reading that a particular geometry problem move was made because 
“opposite angles are equal” results in unnecessary processing for a learner who is 
fully aware of the relevant theorem. That learner does not need to study a worked 
example. Instead, imagining the theorem being used in a series of steps may more 
closely reflect the interacting elements that need to be processed and that constitute 
an intrinsic cognitive load.
The Imagination Effect Prior to Cognitive Load  
Theory Research
The effects of imagining the performance of a task or procedure have had a long 
research history under different names. In early research of the technique, Sackett 
(1934, 1935) suggested the term ‘symbolic rehearsal’, whereas Perry (1939) used 
the term ‘imaginary practice’. Later, ‘mental practice’ (Clark, 1960), ‘introspective 
rehearsal’ (Egstrom, 1964), ‘covert rehearsal’ (Corbin, 1967) and ‘mental rehearsal’ 
(Dunbar, 2000; Rawlings & Rawlings, 1974) were used to describe the technique.
Mental rehearsal became an especially popular area of research in sports 
­psychology and other motor skills-related areas (e.g. Etnier & Landers, 1996; 
Grouios, 1992; Kelsey, 1961; Mendoza & Wichman, 1978; Phipps & Morehouse, 
1969; Romero & Silvestri, 1990; Shick, 1970; Surburg, 1968; Ungerleider & 
Golding, 1991), but it has also been applied to improving more cognitively oriented 
activities and components. For example, the technique was used in behavioural 
counselling (Hazler & Hipple, 1981) and clinical examinations (Rakestraw, Irby, & 
Vontver, 1983). Schirmer (2003) found it beneficial when used with special 
­education students. Self-explanations of problem-solving steps (e.g. Chi, Bassok, 
Lewis, Reimann, & Glaser, 1989; Renkl, 1997) also include some components of 
imagination and, in this respect, can be related to the imagination effect.
Meta-analyses of mental practice were conducted by Driskell, Copper, and 
Moran (1994) and Ginns (2005a), and indicated generally positive effects. It was 
found that the greater the cognitive demands of a task, the more beneficial mental 
practice was in increasing learner performance. Recently, Van Meer and Theunissen 
(2009) conducted a comprehensive meta-review of educational applications of 
mental rehearsal as a technique for improving student performance based on about 
630 studies published between 1806 and 2006. The analysis indicated that the 
effectiveness of this technique is influenced by the type of practiced skill, personal 
factors, time per trial, amount of trials, and instructional procedures. According to 
this meta-review, most of the available publications focused on using mental 
­practice to learn motor skills, especially sports-related skills. Cognitive tasks were 
investigated only occasionally and included mostly simple tasks such as solving 
puzzles or tasks involving verbal practice. However, these tasks produced larger 
effects than motor tasks. The review concluded that the higher the level of involve-
ment of cognitive elements in a task, the greater the improvement in perfor-
mance due to mental practice. Van Meer and Theunissen’s (2009) meta-review also 

186
14 Facilitating Effective Mental Processes
­concluded that mental practice associated with higher expertise levels seemed to 
enhance performance for both cognitive and motor skills. It was noted that in 
­addition to expertise in a specific skill area, experience with the mental practice 
technique itself might also influence the effect.
Empirical Evidence for the Imagination Effect  
Within a Cognitive Load Theory Context
The fact that most work on imagination techniques was carried out using motor 
tasks rather than cognitive tasks but that larger effects were obtained when dealing 
with cognitive tasks than motor tasks suggested that the effect should be considered 
from a cognitive viewpoint. As indicated above, cognitive load theory may be used 
to explain the effect, leading to the Cooper et al. (2001) experiments demonstrating 
that imagining procedures and concepts produced better instructional outcomes 
than simply studying worked examples, but only for more expert students with an 
appropriate knowledge base. The imagining procedure produced a negative effect 
for low-knowledge students, thus reversing the effect and providing another 
­example of the expertise reversal effect.
Following the Cooper et al. (2001) work, a range of studies on the imagination 
effect within a cognitive load theory framework was carried out. Leahy and Sweller 
(2004; Experiment 1) investigated the imagination effect with adults (primary 
school teachers) as participants studying or imagining contour maps. Imagination 
instructions were superior to study instructions on subsequent test questions.
Ginns, Chandler, and Sweller (2003) investigated the effects of the imagination 
technique by varying the complexity of learning materials relative to levels of 
learner expertise. The first experiment involved university students learning HTML 
code. This material was complex for these learners with low levels of prior knowl-
edge in the domain. In accordance with the worked example effect (Chapter 8), 
these participants benefited from repeatedly studying worked examples rather than 
from imagining the examples. In the second experiment, secondary school students 
studied geometry materials in an area in which they had high levels of prior knowl-
edge that rendered these materials relatively less complex for these learners. Results 
indicated that higher levels of post-test performance were reached by the students 
who imagined solution steps after studying worked examples rather than those who 
only studied the examples.
These results were extended by Leahy and Sweller (2005) in experiments with 
primary school students learning to read a bus timetable and temperature graphs. 
In the experiments, the same students were considered initially as novices, and 
2 weeks later – following more practice with the materials – as relative experts in 
the domain. The results indicated that as learners’ levels of expertise increased, the 
advantage switched from studying to imagining examples, in accord with the previ-
ously obtained findings. Furthermore, as intrinsic cognitive load increased, the 

187
The Self-Explanation Effect
interaction effect between instructional category and levels of expertise also 
increased. In other words, both the imagination and the reverse imagination effects 
were larger with higher element interactivity information than with lower element 
interactivity information (see Chapter 15 on the element interactivity effect).
In an experiment with Grade 10 students reading a science text on the dipole 
character of water molecules, Leutner, Leopold, and Sumfleth (2009) compared 
instructional techniques of drawing pictures of text content on paper against 
­mentally imagining text content while reading. The results indicated that while 
drawing pictures increased cognitive load and decreased text comprehension, 
­mental imagery decreased cognitive load and increased comprehension, however 
only when students did not have to draw pictures simultaneously while imagining 
text. Imagining text content may have fostered deeper processing of the material. 
Drawing pictures of text content on paper includes externalising the pictorial 
­information, which may require additional cognitive resources, thus imposing an 
extraneous cognitive load. That cognitive load, at least in part, may be due to split 
attention between the corresponding elements of the text and the external pictorial 
representation drawn by the students.
Thus, the Leutner et al. (2009) study indicates that using mental imagery may 
enhance comprehension without imposing excessive levels of cognitive load. 
However, mental imagery enhances learning only when it is focused directly on the 
text content while reading rather than on other activities or aspects such as an exter-
nal pictorial representation drawn from the text. An instructional implication of this 
study is that the process of imagining should not be accompanied by other activities 
such as learners drawing representations of the imagined elements of information. 
Students who attempt to draw pictures spontaneously should be discouraged from 
doing so if imagination instructions are used. A combination of imagination and 
drawing may overwhelm working memory.
The Self-Explanation Effect
The imagination effect can be related to the self-explanation effect (Bielaczyk, 
Pirolli, & Brown, 1995; Chi, Bassok, Lewis, Reimann, & Glaser, 1989; Chi, de 
Leeuw, Chiu, & LaVancher, 1994; Mwangi & Sweller, 1998; Renkl, 1997; Renkl, 
Stark, Gruber, & Mandl, 1998; Roy & Chi, 2005; VanLehn, Jones, & Chi, 1992; see 
Renkl, 1999 for a comprehensive review) according to which instructing learners to 
engage in self-explaining connections between interacting units of information can 
improve performance. Initially, work on self-explanations was not conducted 
within a cognitive load theory framework, other than emphasising the use of 
worked examples. Nevertheless, the self-explanation effect can be related to the 
imagination effect because self-explanations usually involve imagining a procedure 
or process while trying to relate the procedure or process to known principles of the 
domain.

188
14 Facilitating Effective Mental Processes
Clark, Nguye, and Sweller  (2006) defined a self-explanation as ‘…a mental 
­dialogue that learners have when studying a worked example that helps them 
­understand the example and build a schema from it’ (p. 226). Within a cognitive load 
theoretical context, self-explanations require students to establish the interactions that 
relate various elements of a worked example both to each other and to previous 
knowledge. While not specified in the self-explanation literature, to process these 
interacting elements requires sufficient working memory resources, as indicated by 
the narrow limits of change principle. Whether the resources are likely to be ­available 
will depend heavily on the information store principle. If insufficient knowledge is 
held in long-term memory, as may be the case for novices, the ­environmental organis-
ing and linking principle cannot function, and so working memory resources may not 
be available to deal with the large number of interacting elements associated with 
self-explanations. In addition, for novices, self-explanation may require the random-
ness as genesis principle to a greater extent than for more expert learners who can use 
knowledge from long-term memory to generate appropriate self-explanations via the 
environmental organising and linking principle. More knowledgeable learners who 
can more readily self-explain may benefit considerably from the process.
In a seminal paper, Chi, Bassok, Lewis, Reimann, and Glaser (1989) demon-
strated that learners who process an example more deeply by explaining and 
­providing justifications for the example moves, called self-explanations, learn more 
than ­students who process only the surface structures. Chi et al. showed, using 
physics worked examples, that the most successful learners used a process of 
self-explanation. They also found that good learners monitored their comprehen-
sion more accurately than poor learners, referred to the worked examples less 
frequently, and targeted specific references, rather than the whole example. To 
explain why ­self-explanations are effective, it was argued that learners generate a 
number of inference rules from the principles and definitions provided in the 
worked example. These rules enable learners to link appropriate actions with spe-
cific conditions, which later become procedural skills. Subsequently, Chi (2000) 
extended this ­argument to generating inferences and repairing the learner’s mental 
model (see Atkinson, Renkl, & Merrill, 2003).
Chi, De Leeuw, Chiu, and Lavancher (1994) using a randomised controlled 
study, demonstrated that self-explaining enhanced knowledge acquisition, although 
they did not control for time on task. In their study, one group of Grade 8 students 
were asked to self-explain after reading each line of a passage on the human 
­circulatory system. Students in the control group read the same text twice and were 
not prompted to self-explain. The self-explanation group demonstrated a greater 
knowledge gain. Also, students in this group who generated large numbers of 
­self-explanations (high explainers) learned better than low explainers.
Building on the earlier work by Chi and her collaborators, Renkl (1997) sought 
to investigate individual differences in the quality of self-explanations when learn-
ing from worked examples. College education students were given probability 
problems and were asked to engage in an anticipating, self-explanation technique 
that was similar to the imagination technique. In learning how to solve these prob-
lems, learners were shown a number of worked examples and were required to 

189
The Self-Explanation Effect
verbalise their thoughts concurrently. In this correlational study, it was found 
that learners showed fairly stable self-explanations over different problems. 
Successful learners had qualitative differences in their self-explanations compared 
with less successful learners. In particular, successful learners tended to provide 
principle-based explanations and to anticipate computation of future probabilities. 
Anticipating solution steps of a worked example, which ­constitutes effectively 
solving part of the problem, can be an effective learning technique. Importantly, 
similar to Cooper et al. (2001), Renkl found that this method improved learning 
only for relatively more advanced learners. This ­finding led Renkl to characterise 
successful learners as either principle-based learners or anticipative learners.
Although in the Renkl (1997) study, self-explanations were linked to effective 
learning, it was also shown that very few students provided good self-explanations. 
In a follow-up study, Renkl, Stark, Gruber, and Mandl (1998) predicted that most 
learners needed support in learning from worked examples and investigated what 
factors could influence the quality of self-explanations. In a randomised experi-
ment, a sample of bank apprentices were required to learn about mathematical 
procedures in finance. Self-explanations were either spontaneous or elicited. In the 
spontaneous condition, learners were simply required to verbalise their thoughts, 
but in the elicited condition, learners received training in self-explanations. Results 
showed that the elicitation of self-explanations fostered both near- and far-transfer. 
In addition, measures of prior knowledge indicated that on near-transfer problems, 
learners with low prior knowledge benefited more from elicitation than learners 
with higher prior knowledge.
Research into worked examples and self-explanations was later extended to 
computer-based learning environments. Although previous research into com-
puter environments had been rather mixed, Atkinson, Renkl, and Merrill (2003) 
found positive results using a prompting strategy. In learning about probability 
theorems, students in the prompting conditions were required to self-explain each 
solution step they completed and then identify the probability principle used from 
a list that had been previously covered in an introductory learning phase. Results 
indicated that on both near- and far-transfer test problems, students who received 
self-explanation prompts performed significantly better than students who did not 
receive prompting. The evidence suggested that self-explanations could be com-
bined ­successfully with the use of worked examples. Other research has extended 
these findings by including a large variety of areas such as classroom teaching skills 
and argumentation skills (see Atkinson & Renkl, 2007; Berthold, Eysink, & Renkl, 
2009; Hilbert & Renkl, 2009; Hilbert, Renkl, Kessler, & Reiss, 2008; Schworm & 
Renkl, 2006, 2007, for some of the areas covered). Nevertheless, self-explanation 
studies have not always been successful. Mwangi and Sweller (1999) failed to find 
an advantage on two-step arithmetic word problems, arguing that self-explanations 
may not always be suitable during learning as working memory load is likely to be 
increased when translating procedures into verbal form. As is the case for the 
imagination effect, self-explanations only may be effective once a sufficient level 
of expertise has been attained to allow the environmental organising and linking 
principle to function.

190
14 Facilitating Effective Mental Processes
Conditions of Applicability
Imagination instructions are effective for learners with relatively higher levels of 
prior knowledge and unsuitable for novice learners. Higher levels of expertise 
increase the effectiveness of the imagination technique because more experi-
enced learners have available knowledge structures accessible in long-term 
memory to process information in working memory while imagining. If already 
available, an existing schema can be transferred from long-term to working 
memory and processed in working memory while imagining, but studying is 
required to construct and store that schema in the first instance. As indicated 
above, Cooper et al. (2001), Ginns et al. (2003) and Leahy and Sweller (2005) 
provided evidence for this interaction.
Levels of element interactivity also influence the imagination effect (see Chapter 15 
for the element interactivity effect). Leahy and Sweller (2008) experimentally 
manipulated the levels of element interactivity in instructional materials and ­post-test 
questions in order to test the hypothesis that higher levels of element ­interactivity 
would increase the likelihood of obtaining an imagination effect. A significant 
interaction between the imagination and element interactivity effects was obtained. 
Imagining materials that were low in element interactivity resulted in no significant 
benefits, whereas for high element interactivity materials, learners who were asked 
to imagine materials outperformed learners who were asked only to study the same 
materials. Imagining high element interactivity materials allowed learners to com-
bine the multiple interacting elements of information into a single schematic ele-
ment that could be more readily processed in working memory. The results also 
indicated that greater differences between the two instructional groups were 
obtained on post-test questions tapping high rather than low element interactivity 
knowledge.
Leahy and Sweller (2005) also demonstrated the interaction between levels of 
element interactivity and the imagination effect by demonstrating that the effect 
increased with increases in element interactivity, an interaction common to most, 
possibly all cognitive load effects (see Chapter 15). In addition, as indicated above, 
they also demonstrated the commonly obtained interaction between levels of exper-
tise and the imagination effect.
There are other interactions between the imagination effect and other cognitive 
load effects. In order for the imagination effect to be obtained, learners must 
have sufficient working memory resources to allow them to imagine. Therefore, the 
imagination effect might be expected to be facilitated by techniques that reduce work-
ing memory load or otherwise enhance working memory functioning.
With Grade 4 students as participants, Leahy and Sweller (2004) compared 
studying and imagining temperature–time graphs that depicted temperature varia-
tions presented in either split-source or integrated formats. Whereas the split-source 
format used spatially separated diagrams and text, with text located on a separate 
page, in the integrated format, the text was spatially embedded into the diagram 
(see Chapter 9). Post-test results indicated that imagining was beneficial to student 

191
Conditions of Applicability
learning compared to studying the material, but the effect was only obtained with 
the integrated rather than the split-source instructional format. It was assumed from 
these results that the imagining procedure could only succeed if there were suffi-
cient working memory resources to permit imagining. A split-source presentation 
might have imposed an excessive cognitive load making the use of the imagination 
technique difficult or impossible and resulting in a relative failure of this instruc-
tional procedure. It was easier and more effective to imagine integrated rather than 
split-source materials. Integrated instructions facilitated schema acquisition, and 
schema acquisition in turn facilitated the imagination effect.
According to the modality effect, working memory capacity can be effectively 
increased, and learning improved by using a dual mode presentation, involving for 
example visual diagrams and auditory rather than written text (see Chapter 10). 
Accord­ingly, Tindall-Ford and Sweller (2006) demonstrated that the imagination 
effect could be facilitated when accompanied by audio-visual instructions compared 
to visual only instructions. One of their experiments used instructions on how to 
construct a frequency table, how to sum frequencies and how to calculate the mean, 
mode and range using the table with Grade 8 secondary school students. Four instruc-
tional formats were compared: (1) audio-visual instructions followed by an imagina-
tion component; (2) audio-visual instructions followed by a conventional study-based 
strategy; (3) visual only instructions followed by an imagination component; and 
(4) visual only instructions followed by a conventional study-based strategy.
The results indicated that the imagination effect was only obtained under audio-
visual, but not under visual only conditions. The audio-visual technique facilitated 
schema construction, and then the follow-up imagination procedure allowed for 
schema automation. Thus, students’ ability to imagine the information was enhanced 
when audio-visual instructions were used prior to imagining the mathematical pro-
cedure. Verbal protocols used in a follow-up experiment (Tindall-Ford & Sweller, 
2006, Experiment 2) provided evidence that learners processed the material differ-
ently when asked to study or imagine it, and that the imagination process was 
assisted by the use of audio-visual instruction. Learners who studied tended to 
engage in search, while learners who imagined focused on essential entities and 
relations in the materials.
In summary, under suitable conditions, the imagination effect is stable and robust. 
Imagining procedures or concepts reduces an extraneous cognitive load that is 
imposed on relatively more experienced learners when they study material that is 
redundant for these learners. The major conditions required for the effect are that 
element interactivity due to intrinsic cognitive load must be high, a condition 
required for all cognitive load effects, and that despite the requirement for a high 
intrinsic cognitive load, learners must have sufficient cognitive resources to enable 
them to imagine the procedures or concepts. Sufficient cognitive resources can be 
ensured either by using learners with some level of expertise in the domain or by 
associating imagination instructions with other cognitive load reducing procedures.
We might speculate that the conditions of applicability that are relevant to the 
imagination effect are equally relevant to the self-explanation effect. To this point, 
the relevant studies have not been carried out.

14 Facilitating Effective Mental Processes
Instructional Implications
The imagination effect can be used in most education and training contexts. Based 
on the results reported in this chapter, once a sufficient level of knowledge has been 
attained for learners to be able to imagine complex concepts and procedures, they 
should be encouraged to do so. Neither learners nor instructors should assume a 
concept or procedure is ‘known’ once it is understood. Beyond understanding, 
most concepts or procedures need to be used flexibly in a variety of circumstances. 
That flexibility is likely to be enhanced by the use of the imagination technique. 
Knowledge also is likely to be needed in order to advance further in a field. By 
imagining procedures or concepts, students are likely to be better equipped when 
continuing to learn in a discipline area.
Similarly, we know that self-explanations can facilitate knowledge acquisition 
and understanding. Encouraging learners to engage in self-explanations can be 
expected to increase the effectiveness of instruction, especially instruction that uses 
worked examples.
The imagination and self-explanation effects may be related to deliberate practice 
in the acquisition of expertise. Deliberate practice is used intentionally to enhance 
performance on a specific skill (Ericsson & Charness, 1994; Ericsson, Krampe, & 
Tesch-Romer, 1993). Imagining or self-explaining a procedure can be regarded as a 
form of deliberate practice that requires intentional processing of information in 
working memory to strengthen schemas held in long-term memory.
Conclusions
Studying concepts and procedures is known to be an effective and efficient 
instructional method for novice learners in the initial stages of skill acquisition. 
For relatively more experienced learners, on the other hand, the use of techniques 
such as imagining is highly effective. The imagination effect provides evidence 
that encouraging learners to imagine can be advantageous providing they have 
acquired sufficient expertise in the domain to use the technique. We can predict 
that encouraging learners to self-explain should similarly be more effective for 
more knowledgeable than less knowledgeable students.

As discussed in Chapter 5, total cognitive load, consisting of intrinsic and extrane-
ous cognitive load, must not exceed working memory resources in order for learn-
ing to be effective. From this perspective, applying learning strategies aimed at 
reducing extraneous cognitive load is more important when intrinsic cognitive load 
is high. If intrinsic cognitive load is low, a high extraneous cognitive load may not 
inhibit learning because the total cognitive load may be well within the available 
working memory capacity. Thus, for instructional conditions with a low intrinsic 
cognitive load, optimising instructional design may not be as important as for situ-
ations with a high intrinsic cognitive load.
Intrinsic cognitive load is determined by the level of interactivity between 
essential elements of information. If this element interactivity is low, using an 
instructional design that causes a high extraneous load may not interfere with 
learning. On the other hand, if the level of interactivity between essential elements 
of information is high, adding more element interactivity associated with a high 
extraneous cognitive load due to a suboptimal instructional design (Chapter 5) 
may well result in a total load well in excess of working memory capacity. Under 
high intrinsic cognitive load conditions, optimising instructional designs may be 
­critical. Therefore, most of the cognitive load effects discussed in the previous 
chapters dealt with instructional conditions under which both intrinsic and extra-
neous cognitive load were high.
As examples, when dealing with very few intrinsically interacting elements, it 
may not matter whether learners must use the randomness as genesis principle via 
a random generate and test process to solve a problem or to find relations between 
sources of information presented separately that result in split-attention. Learners 
may have sufficient working memory resources to deal with these situations 
whether they are using the randomness as genesis principle or the borrowing and 
reorganising principle if element interactivity due to intrinsic cognitive load is 
­sufficiently low.
The fact that cognitive load effects tend to be obtainable only if intrinsic 
­cognitive load is high is referred to as the element interactivity effect (Sweller, 
2010; Sweller & Chandler, 1994). This effect depends on the total element

­interactivity associated with both intrinsic and extraneous cognitive load. It is 
treated as a separate cognitive load effect because there is substantial empirical 
evidence that levels of element interactivity due to intrinsic cognitive load have 
profound effects on other cognitive load effects associated with extraneous cogni-
tive load. This chapter consolidates this evidence by explaining in more detail 
some of the studies previously described in Part IV and how they specifically 
relate to element interactivity.
Empirical Evidence for the Element Interactivity Effect
From a theoretical perspective, element interactivity associated with intrinsic 
­cognitive load should be a relevant factor for all cognitive load effects, especially 
effects relying on variations in extraneous cognitive load. The element interactivity 
effect has been demonstrated for a large range of extraneous cognitive load effects, 
but has not been tested for all. We will discuss element interactivity associated with 
intrinsic cognitive load for those extraneous cognitive load effects for which data 
are available.
Element Interactivity and the Split-Attention  
and Redundancy Effects
In a series of experiments, Sweller and Chandler (1994)  and Chandler and Sweller 
(1996) tested for split-attention and redundancy effects associated with learning 
computer applications using manuals and computers. When both a computer and 
a manual are used during instruction, either split-attention or redundancy may 
occur (see Chapters 9 and 11). Alternative methods of presentation can be designed 
to reduce the extraneous load and facilitate learning in comparison with a 
­traditional use of manuals together with hardware such as computers or other 
equipment. Sweller and Chandler suggested that if a properly designed manual 
was used that eliminated split-attention and redundancy, the hardware itself could 
be redundant. Eliminating the hardware during the initial instructional period and 
replacing it by corresponding diagrams with integrated textual explanations in the 
manual were hypothesised to reduce the extraneous cognitive load caused either 
by split-attention between the manual and the hardware or redundancy, where the 
hardware was redundant. For example, in the case of learning to use a computer, 
both the monitor and keyboard can be replaced by diagrams of the computer 
screen and keyboard with textual explanations physically integrated at their appro-
priate locations on the diagrams. By this procedure, split-attention or redundancy 
that is associated with the presence of the computer itself can be eliminated, thus 
reducing extraneous cognitive load.

195
Empirical Evidence for the Element Interactivity Effect
The results of experiments using both computing-based materials as well as 
electrical engineering instructions demonstrated both the split-attention and redun-
dancy effects with the modified instructional materials. A format consisting only 
of an integrated, self-contained manual outperformed a conventional manual that 
did not include integrated diagrams and text demonstrating a split-attention effect. 
A self-contained manual format in which learners did not have access to the hard-
ware also outperformed the same self-contained manual along with the actual 
computer, thus rendering the hardware redundant and demonstrating the redun-
dancy effect. Furthermore and critically for the current discussion, both the split-
attention and redundancy effects were obtained only in areas where the instructional 
material involved a high level of element interactivity.
In the above studies, the degree of element interactivity was estimated a priori 
by counting the number of elements that must be considered simultaneously by 
learners with a specific level of expertise in order to learn a particular procedure. 
For example, when learning how to use a computer-aided design/computer-aided 
manufacture (CAD/CAM) package, the procedure for moving the cursor in 1 mm 
steps ‘Press one of four arrow keys’ represents a low element interactivity task that 
can be learned easily without reference to other elements such as the function of 
other keys. On the other hand, the procedure for moving between any two positions 
represents a high element interactivity task for a novice learner as it involves simul-
taneous processing of the following nine interacting elements (Chandler & Sweller, 
1996, p. 170):
	1.	 Read horizontal axis value for current position
	2.	 Read vertical axis value for current position
	3.	 Find position of the goal co-ordinate on the horizontal axis
	4.	 Find position of the goal co-ordinate on the vertical axis
	5.	 Find point of intersection for the goal horizontal and vertical positions
	6.	 Calculate the difference between the current and goal positions on the horizontal 
axis
	7.	 Press keys appropriate to value calculated in 6
	8.	 Calculate the difference between the current and goal position on the vertical 
axis
	9.	 Press keys appropriate to value calculated in 8
When the previously described instructional formats were tested with technical 
apprentices, Chandler and Sweller (1996) showed that for instructions that involved 
high element interactivity materials, the self-contained modified manual format 
demonstrated its superiority over the conventional manual plus computer format 
for both written and practical post-tests, demonstrating the split-attention effect. 
Similarly, the self-contained, modified manual also was superior to the modified 
manual plus computer presentation, thus demonstrating the redundancy effect. No 
differences were found between instructional formats when the learning materials 
were low in element interactivity.
Direct evidence that these findings were due to cognitive load rather than 
other factors came from measures of cognitive load based on a secondary task. 

196
15 The Element Interactivity Effect
The secondary task was presented on a separate computer and involved a tone 
that was immediately followed by a letter appearing on the screen. Learners had 
to recall the previous letter seen on the screen, while encoding the new letter. 
When instructional materials involved low or no interaction between elements of 
information and, consequently, a low intrinsic cognitive load, the added extrane-
ous load imposed by differing instructional formats did not substantially inhibit 
learner performance on the secondary task. In this case, a sufficient working 
memory capacity was still available to perform the secondary task at a high level 
irrespective of instructional format. Accordingly, all three groups had little 
­difficulty on the secondary task when studying the low element interactivity 
­segments of the instructional material and performed at similar levels. However, 
the secondary task performance of the conventional manual plus computer 
(split-attention) and the modified manual plus computer (redundancy) groups 
were reduced substantially when high element interactivity instructional 
­segments were studied.
Element Interactivity and Understanding Instructions
The extent to which we understand instructions depends on levels of element 
­interactivity. Increases in levels of element interactivity increase the difficulty of 
understanding as more elements must be processed simultaneously in working 
memory. If the number of elements exceeds the capacity of working memory, the 
material cannot be understood until some of the elements have been incorporated 
into schemas that can be treated as a single element. It is possible to present the 
same information in a form that alters element interactivity by altering the extent to 
which pre-existing schemas are used to process the required elements. If a schema 
can be used to incorporate interacting elements, working memory load can be 
reduced (Marcus, Cooper, & Sweller, 1996).  
Marcus et  al. (1996) presented primary school students with electrical resistor 
­problems. Functionally identical instructions could be presented using either diagrams 
or text. Diagrams tended to be more familiar to learners with each incorporating 
­several interacting elements. Because of familiarity, those interacting elements could 
be easily incorporated into a schema processed as a single element. The same interact-
ing elements, presented in textual form, had to be processed as individual elements 
resulting in a large increase in element interactivity and cognitive load compared to 
diagrams. Cognitive load was measured using both subjective measures of load and 
secondary tasks. Results indicated that firstly, the greater the number of interacting 
elements the greater the cognitive load and the harder it was to understand the 
­information, and secondly, the use of diagrams reduced cognitive load and enhanced 
understanding compared to the same information presented in textual form.
These experiments clearly established the relations between cognitive load, 
­element interactivity and understanding. High levels of element interactivity are a 
major impediment to understanding.

197
Empirical Evidence for the Element Interactivity Effect
Element Interactivity and the Modality Effect
A meta-analysis of modality effect studies by Ginns (2005b) supported element 
interactivity as a major moderator of the effect. Tindall-Ford, Chandler, and Sweller 
(1997) provided direct experimental evidence for the importance of element 
­interactivity in obtaining the modality effect. They found strong effects in favour of 
dual-modality formats in which wiring diagrams or tables were provided with 
­narrated textual explanations over single-modality formats in which diagrams or 
tables were provided with printed textual explanations. These effects were obtained 
only for materials with high levels of element interactivity. There were no differ-
ences between spoken and written text for low element interactivity instructions.
Experiment 1 of Tindall-Ford et al. (1997) used instructional material designed to 
demonstrate how to carry out electrical tests of an electrical appliance using a volt-
meter. These materials involved a high degree of element interactivity for a novice 
learner. For example, to understand the test of insulation resistance, the learner must 
simultaneously consider the required setting for the voltmeter and where to place the 
earth lead and the other lead on the kettle, ensure the electric kettle switch is on, 
press the test button, know what the required result should be, and then change the 
earth lead from the active pin to the neutral pin and perform the test again. The 
results of this experiment demonstrated benefits of presenting instructional material 
in either an integrated or audio-visual format.
The instructions used in Experiment 2 constituted table-based information 
relating to electrical installation and current-carrying capacity used for selecting 
appropriate cables for electrical installations. The instructions required learners to 
relate different elements of information and were high in element interactivity. For 
instance, the purpose of cable size on the table is only made clear if it is related to 
other table entities such as type of cable, core of cable, maximum load of cable 
and installation techniques. A modality effect also was obtained in this ­experiment, 
and subjective ratings of cognitive load supported a cognitive load explanation of 
the results.
Experiment 3 used separate and independent low and high element interactivity 
instructional materials including electrical symbols and electrical circuits. Low 
element interactivity instruction consisted of 30 electrical symbols and their cor-
responding meanings that could be learned independently of each other. For 
instance, the electrical symbol for a fluorescent lamp could be learned 
­independently of the symbol for a general switch. High element interactivity 
instructional materials included different electrical circuits and their associated 
explanations. To understand each circuit, many elements and their relationships 
needed to be assimilated simultaneously. The results from the test items, subjec-
tive rating scales and measures of instructional efficiency indicated strong modality 
effects for materials with high levels of interactivity. On the other hand, when 
learning electrical symbols, there were no differences between instructional pre-
sentation formats. Again, subjective ratings supported a cognitive load explana-
tion of the results.

198
15 The Element Interactivity Effect
Thus, learning materials with high levels of element interactivity (e.g. complex 
wiring diagrams) may cause a cognitive overload of the visual channel that may 
be further worsened by the extraneous cognitive load due to split-attention 
between visually presented sources of information that refer to each other (e.g. 
diagrams and printed explanations). Using a dual-modality format may effec-
tively reduce this load and expand cognitive resources available for learning by 
engaging both processing channels of working memory. On the other hand, if 
learning materials have low levels of element interactivity as occurs, for example, 
when learning the meaning of individual electrical symbols, then even relatively 
high levels of extraneous cognitive load may still be within working memory 
limits and not interfere with learning.
Element Interactivity and the Expertise Reversal Effect
We might expect element interactivity to interact with the expertise reversal effect. 
We know that levels of element interactivity are dependent on levels of expertise. 
As expertise increases, interacting elements become incorporated within schemas 
and can be treated as single elements. As a consequence, element interactivity 
becomes less of a problem with increasing expertise. This relation between element 
interactivity and levels of expertise gives rise to the interaction between the 
element interactivity effect and the expertise reversal effect.
Kalyuga, Chandler, and Sweller (2001)  compared worked examples-based instruc-
tion on how to construct switching equations for relay circuits with an exploratory 
learning environment. When the knowledge level of trainees was increased through 
specifically designed training sessions, the exploratory group achieved better results 
than the worked examples group. Subjective measures of task difficulty supported the 
cognitive load interpretation of the effect.
In this study, two task levels were used: structurally simple tasks with few circuit 
elements and a very limited number of possible options to explore, and structurally 
complex tasks with more interactive circuit elements and numerous options to 
explore. These two task levels corresponded to low and high levels of element inter-
activity. Simple tasks included only three interacting input elements and allowed 
construction of nine different acceptable relay circuits with various possible connec-
tions. Complex tasks required learners to construct and write equations for various 
relay circuits containing five interacting input elements, three of which were already 
placed into the diagram at fixed locations. This complex task environment allowed 
construction of 89 acceptable relay circuits with various possible connections.
As expected, the expertise reversal effect was obtained only for relatively 
­complex tasks with high levels of element interactivity. There were no differences 
between the instructional methods for the simple tasks. For the relatively simple 
circuits, cognitive load was much lower and within the limits of working memory 
for either instructional format.

199
Conditions of Applicability
Element Interactivity and the Imagination Effect
Leahy and Sweller (2005) demonstrated that as primary school students’ experience 
in reading a bus timetable and temperature graphs increased, the advantage of 
studying worked examples declined in favour of imagining examples, in accord 
with the imagination and expertise reversal effects. In addition, the experiments 
also showed that as the intrinsic cognitive load imposed by the learning materials 
increased, the interaction between these instructional methods and levels of learner 
expertise also increased. Both the imagination and the worked example effects were 
larger for materials with higher levels of element interactivity than for materials 
with lower levels of element interactivity.
When investigating an imagination effect using bus timetable materials with 
primary school students, Leahy and Sweller (2008) experimentally manipulated the 
levels of element interactivity in the instructional materials and post-test questions 
by varying the complexity of tasks. For example, when students were requested to 
find the categories of route numbers for which buses did not stop at every street 
(odd numbered routes in the table), they had to simultaneously process many inter-
acting elements in working memory, such as holding the meaning of buses not 
stopping at every street, holding the meaning of route numbers, searching for col-
umns with blanks, looking up the route numbers, looking at odd numbers and 
checking that they were blank, etc. This task was high in element interactivity. On 
the other hand, answering a question such as: ‘What does the letter “e” stand for?’ 
required only three interacting element to be processed. These elements were: hold-
ing the letter in working memory, searching for ‘e’, and transforming the letter 
searched into its appropriate word to provide an answer.
As predicted, a significant interaction between the imagination effect and levels 
of element interactivity was obtained in this study. Imagining materials that were 
low in element interactivity resulted in no significant benefits, whereas for high 
element interactivity materials, learners who were asked to imagine materials out-
performed learners who were asked only to study the same materials. Imagining 
high element interactivity materials allowed learners to combine the multiple inter-
acting elements of information into a single schema that could be more readily 
processed in working memory. The results also indicated that greater differences 
between the two instructional groups were obtained on post-test questions tapping 
high rather than low element interactivity knowledge.
Conditions of Applicability
Similar to the expertise reversal effect (Chapter 12), the element interactivity effect 
relies on an interaction between other cognitive load effects and specific factors, in 
this case, levels of element interactivity associated with intrinsic cognitive load. 
There is also an obvious relation between these two effects as the levels of element 
interactivity that produce an intrinsic cognitive load are always relative to levels of 

200
15 The Element Interactivity Effect
learner expertise. The same material can reflect a high level of interactivity for a 
novice learner and at the same time a low level of interactivity for an expert because 
as expertise increases, interacting elements are incorporated into schemas, reducing 
working memory load in accord with the environmental organising and linking 
principle. Therefore, a complex task for a novice may be a relatively simple one for 
an expert. Learners’ prior knowledge allows many interacting elements to be 
­incorporated, or chunked, in a single schema acting as a single element in working 
memory. In contrast, learners with low prior knowledge are unable to chunk 
­information into a single schema and must attempt to simultaneously process the 
interacting elements in working memory.
Accordingly, lower levels of element interactivity associated with intrinsic 
­cognitive load are expected to have similar consequences to higher levels of learner 
expertise. As learners acquire more expertise in a specific task domain, the levels 
of element interactivity associated with particular instructional materials change. 
Categories of learning tasks that reflected relatively high levels of element interac-
tivity become low in element interactivity as expertise increases. Lower levels of 
element interactivity associated with intrinsic cognitive load due to increased 
expertise allow higher levels of extraneous cognitive load to be handled without 
overloading working memory.
The element interactivity effect defines an essential condition of applicability for 
other cognitive load effects dealing with extraneous cognitive load. Another 
­condition of applicability of this effect is that intrinsic cognitive load itself should 
not exceed the available working memory resources of learners. For example, when 
dealing with excessively complex materials for which learners do not have ­sufficient 
prior knowledge, very high levels of intrinsic cognitive load may be experienced. 
In this case, cognitive load effects aimed at reducing intrinsic cognitive load need 
to be applied (e.g. the isolated–interacting elements effect, Chapter 16).
Instructional Implications
If element interactivity associated with intrinsic cognitive load is low, adding more 
interacting elements associated with a high extraneous cognitive load may not 
inhibit learning provided working memory capacity is not exceeded. For example, 
if students learn a new foreign language vocabulary in which each new item can be 
learned independently from all other items, the manner in which the material is 
presented may not matter a great deal as the resulting, total working memory load 
will be within available working memory capacity. In this situation, redesigning 
instructional procedures or formats by applying cognitive load effects aimed at 
reducing extraneous load may have minimal (if any) effects on learning.
Alternatively, adding the interacting elements associated with a high extraneous 
cognitive load to the interacting elements associated with a high intrinsic cognitive 
load can exceed working memory capacity. In this situation, reducing the element 
interactivity associated with extraneous load by applying appropriate cognitive 

201
Conclusion
load techniques may be critical for learning. For example, if split-attention or 
redundancy is incorporated into learning materials with high levels of element 
interactivity associated with intrinsic cognitive load such as complex equations or 
wiring diagrams in electronics, the total number of interacting elements and 
­corresponding total cognitive load may exceed working memory capacity. 
Reducing the number of interacting elements associated with extraneous cognitive 
load by integrating related sources of information or eliminating redundant infor-
mation can reduce working memory load to manageable levels.
Conclusion
By definition, cognitive load theory is concerned with the instructional implications 
of an excessive working memory load. It is not surprising that those instructional 
implications are most likely to be manifest when dealing with materials that 
­themselves impose a heavy cognitive load irrespective of how they are presented. 
If the element interactivity that leads to an intrinsic cognitive load is low, any addi-
tional element interactivity due to an extraneous cognitive load may be irrelevant if 
the total cognitive load is within working memory capacity limits. On the other 
hand, with a high level of element interactivity associated with intrinsic cognitive 
load, any additional element interactivity due to an extraneous cognitive load may 
be increasingly important. As a consequence, most cognitive load effects only 
manifest themselves under conditions of a high intrinsic cognitive load leading to 
the element interactivity effect.
The majority of cognitive load effects occur due to reductions in extraneous 
cognitive load. The element interactivity effect indicates that intrinsic cognitive 
load inevitably is equally important in determining total cognitive load and in deter-
mining the effectiveness of instructional manipulations carried out in order to 
reduce extraneous cognitive load. Fewer studies have been carried out in which 
intrinsic cognitive load has been directly manipulated. The fact that intrinsic cogni-
tive load cannot be manipulated if the nature of the task and the expertise of the 
learners remain constant contribute to this dearth of studies. Nevertheless, element 
interactivity due to intrinsic cognitive load can be manipulated by changing the 
nature of a task. That issue is considered in the next chapter.

As described in Chapter 15, the concept of element interactivity provides a theoretical 
construct underpinning understanding and learning. Instructional material that is low 
in element interactivity and consequently low in intrinsic cognitive load requires few 
working memory resources, because the constituent elements do not interact and can 
be understood and learned in isolation. Other material that is high in element interac-
tivity and intrinsic cognitive load includes elements that interact and must be pro-
cessed simultaneously as they cannot be understood and learned as single elements. 
High element interactivity information is a major category of information that is of 
interest to cognitive load theory. Processing such information requires working 
memory resources that may exceed its capacity. That information cannot be easily 
understood or learned and creates a significant challenge for teachers and instruc-
tional designers. How can students learn new, complex, high element interactivity 
information if the processing demand is greater than working memory capacity?
As previously discussed, we define complexity in terms of element interactivity 
and intrinsic cognitive load (Chapter 5). Such complexity requires particular 
instructional strategies. Whereas extraneous cognitive load can be manipulated by 
the instructional designer, and lowered accordingly, intrinsic cognitive load is fixed 
and cannot be changed without altering either what is being taught and learned or 
altering the knowledge of the learner. If learners have a high degree of domain-
specific knowledge, they are able to process a number of interacting elements 
simultaneously without a heavy working memory load. Learners’ prior knowledge 
allows many interacting elements to be incorporated in a single schema that can act 
as a single element in working memory. In contrast, learners with low prior knowl-
edge are unable to chunk multiple, interacting elements of information into a single 
schema and must attempt to simultaneously process the individual elements in 
working memory, imposing a high intrinsic cognitive load.
In this chapter, we describe strategies that have proved to be effective in dealing 
with inappropriate levels of intrinsic cognitive load. As indicated above, intrinsic 
cognitive load only can be altered by either altering the knowledge of learners or 
altering the nature of the task. Several strategies focus on building domain-specific 
prior knowledge by an appropriate sequencing of learning tasks, but we also 
describe some studies that have focused on altering the nature of the task. Strategies

that sequence materials have taken many forms, but usually they involve progressing 
from simple to complex tasks. Whereas there has been much research into how 
topics should be sequenced over whole training programmes (see Reigeluth, 2007; 
Ritter, Nerb, Lehtinen, & O’Shea, 2007), we focus more on instructional sequenc-
ing within individual learning tasks.
Pre-training
One method of reducing intrinsic load is to develop specific prior knowledge before 
the key materials are presented. This method is often referred to as pre-training. 
From the perspective of human cognitive architecture, pre-training increases knowl-
edge in long-term memory. Rather than searching for relations between elements 
using the randomness as genesis principle, those relations already are stored and can 
be used by the environmental organising and linking principle to process informa-
tion and so reduce working memory load (narrow limits of change principle).
Mayer, Mathias, and Wetzell (2002) taught learners how brakes work from a 
narrated animation. When processing a narrated animation, both a component 
model (how the brake piston moves) and a causal model (relations between the 
piston movement and what happens to the brake fluid) need to be built simultane-
ously, which places very heavy demands on working memory. By pre-training on 
the component model as opposed to learning the component and causal models 
simultaneously, more attention can be paid later to causal effects. The results of 
Mayer, Mathias, et al. (2002) indicated that pre-training, limited to just names and 
behaviours of the component parts, led to significant improvements in problem 
solving. A further study by Mayer, Mautone, and Prothero (2002) using a game-
based geology lesson demonstrated that students who received pre-training on 
illustrations of key geological features (e.g. a ridge) showed superior problem-
solving performance than students who did not receive such training.
These results can be interpreted in terms of a reduction in element interactivity 
and intrinsic cognitive load due to pre-training. The component and causal models 
of Mayer, Mathias, et al. (2002) are closely related and so their elements interact. 
A causal model is unintelligible without the component model. Presenting both 
simultaneously best exemplifies the interactivity between the elements but at the 
cost of a very heavy intrinsic cognitive load that may prevent learning. By learning 
the component model first, many of the interacting elements can be embedded in 
schemas that can be treated as a single element when later considering the causal 
model. In this way, element interactivity remains relatively low throughout learning 
and so within working memory limits.
As indicated in Chapter  12 when discussing the expertise reversal effect, Clarke, 
Ayres, and Sweller (2005) conducted a study that focused on pre-training a secondary 
skill (spreadsheet knowledge) that was required for learning specific primary con-
cepts (mathematical graphs). It is often recommended by educators that many 
mathematical concepts can be learned effectively with the aid of spreadsheets. 

205
Focusing on Subgoals
However, combining novel spreadsheets applications with novel mathematical 
concepts can result in a task that is very high in element interactivity. Clarke et al. 
(2005) found that students with initially low knowledge of spreadsheets benefited 
from pre-training on spreadsheets before using them to learn mathematical con-
cepts compared with a concurrent strategy of simultaneously dealing with the 
spreadsheets and mathematical concepts. Simultaneously dealing with elements 
associated with both spreadsheets and mathematics overwhelmed working memory 
resources for these students. In contrast, students who had more knowledge of 
spreadsheets benefited from the concurrent approach. These more knowledgeable 
learners already had many of the elements associated with spreadsheets incorpo-
rated into schemas and so it was unnecessary to instruct them in using spreadsheets 
independently of the mathematics.
Focusing on Subgoals
Catrambone (1998) observed that learners have difficulty transferring knowledge 
gained through a set of examples to tasks that are conceptually similar but proce-
durally quite different. In a set of experiments in a statistical domain, Catrambone 
(1998) showed that if learners structured their solutions in terms of subgoals, trans-
fer of knowledge was achieved. An important part of this process was a cueing 
strategy (borrowing and reorganizing principle), where labels were used to cue 
students into noticing that certain steps could be grouped. The underlying theoretical 
argument proposed that if the learners were cued that certain solution steps 
belonged together then they would try to self-explain (see Chi, Bassok, Lewis, 
Reimann, & Glaser, 1989) the purpose of the steps and why they belong together. 
The self-explanation effect occurs when learners who explain a concept or proce-
dure to themselves learn more than learners who do not self-explain (see Chapter 14). 
It is notable that learners did not receive practice on predefined subgoals, as might 
be expected from a pre-training strategy, but were required to form them from the 
cues provided. Nevertheless, the strategy enabled learners to transfer their knowl-
edge, suggesting that robust schemas were acquired.
Chi, de Leeuw, Chiu, and LaVancher (1994) commented that a learner is more 
likely to integrate new knowledge with old if tasks are completed in small sections. 
From a cognitive load perspective, this suggestion is consistent with a reduction in 
intrinsic cognitive load. By creating an instructional environment that focuses on 
subgoals, element interactivity is lowered because only the elements within a sub-
goal ‘section’ need to be considered at a given time rather than all of the elements 
in the task. If, for example, a solution to a problem requires eight steps, but it can 
be divided into two groupings of four steps each, then the added element interactivity 
of the two subgroups may be considerably lower than processing the eight steps 
together. Of course, it must be remembered that the reduction in element interactiv-
ity is caused by a change in the task. Learners no longer learn how elements in the 
two separate segments interact between the segments, only within the segments.

16 Altering Element Interactivity and Intrinsic Cognitive load
Presenting Declarative and Procedural Information Separately
Based on Anderson’s (1996) ACT theory, Kester, Kirschner, and van Merriënboer 
(2006) distinguished between two types of information that must be managed during 
problem solving: declarative and procedural. In Kester et al.’s study, declarative 
information is defined as related to reasoning about the cause of the problem and 
finding a solution, whereas procedural information is related to manipulating the 
environment. Kester et al. argued that processing both types of information at the 
same time can lead to a cognitive overload. In particular, it was theorized that 
declarative knowledge has a higher degree of element interactivity than procedural 
information and therefore should not be presented during practice. Also, by avoid-
ing procedures initially, more working memory can be devoted to elaboration of the 
new information, leading to schema acquisition. Kester et al. considered this pro-
cess as a  just-in-time strategy where intrinsic cognitive load is managed by initially 
not including the procedural aspects of the task.
In a four-group comparison using tasks that required troubleshooting in electrical 
circuits, it was found that a strategy that sequenced information in the order of 
declarative (pre-practice) followed by procedural (during practice) or vice versa was 
superior on transfer tasks than a strategy that presented both declarative and proce-
dural knowledge before practice or during practice. These results indicated clearly 
that it was better to present some of the information before practice and some during 
practice in a piece-by-piece manner in order to reduce intrinsic cognitive load.
Reducing Intrinsic Load in Worked Examples
Gerjets, Scheiter, and Catrambone (2004) distinguished between molar and modular 
presentation of solutions in worked examples. According to theories of expertise 
and the relation of expertise to schema acquisition, successful problem solving is 
due to schematic knowledge and categorisation skills. Once a problem is identified 
as belonging to a certain category then a relevant schema (if available in long-term 
memory) is retrieved containing the required solution (Chi, Glaser, & Rees, 1982). 
Gerjets et al. pointed out that traditional textbooks, particularly in the sciences, 
emphasise the categorisation of problems as an important step in problem solving. 
Students learn categories of problems and their associated solutions. This strategy 
is referred to as ‘recipe’ or the molar way of learning. Gerjets et al. also argued that 
for novice learners, a focus on problem categories suitable for experts may create 
a high cognitive load and may not be an effective way to learn. They commented 
as follows:
A category-based approach requires learners to keep in mind all category-defining struc-
tural features of a problem before they accurately decide on its problem category and the 
appropriate formula needed for its solution. Accordingly, studying molar examples requires 
that learners consider multiple structural task features at the same time in order to under-
stand the problem’s category membership. (p. 43)

207
Reducing Intrinsic Load in Worked Examples
Gerjets et al. (2004) suggested that a high degree of intrinsic cognitive load will 
prevent elaboration and comparisons between the different types of examples, thus 
leading to shallow learning. To prevent this situation, they advocated a decrease in 
intrinsic load through a modular approach that emphasised partly independent 
modules that could be used for the necessary calculation. Because each module 
could be considered meaningfully in isolation, element interactivity and intrinsic 
cognitive load was reduced.
In a series of experiments, Gerjets et al. directly compared a modular strategy 
with a molar strategy. Using problems from probability theory that required the use 
of permutations or combinations, they provided the example of working out the 
probability of correctly guessing the first three places in a 100-m race involving 
seven runners. For the molar solution, key features of the task were identified, 
explaining why it is a permutation-without replacement problem. This explanation 
was followed by a general formula that calculated the total number of permutations, 
n!/(n − k)! Finally, the actual numbers relevant to the problem were inserted (n = 7, 
k = 3) and this number inverted for the final probability answer of 1/210. In contrast, 
the modular approach considered and calculated each event (1st, 2nd and 3rd) indi-
vidually in separate, modular sections. Finally, the three probabilities (1/7, 1/6, and 
1/5) were multiplied together for the final answer.
From a cognitive load perspective, considering a generalised formula (molar 
approach) involves a number of interacting elements that must be processed simul-
taneously including who comes first, second and third in the race. For the modular 
approach, by concentrating on one finishing position at a time, element interactivity 
is significantly decreased. By breaking down the formula into constituent parts, 
corresponding elements are isolated.
The results reported in this paper indicated that the modular approach was supe-
rior to the molar approach on similar and novel (transfer) problems, involving dif-
ferent types of problem categories and learners (both low and high prior knowledge), 
and took less study time. In a further study, Gerjets, Scheiter, and Catrambone 
(2006) investigated the impact of instructional explanations and self-explanations 
on modular and molar techniques in the same probability domain. Both instruc-
tional explanations and self-explanations made no difference to either molar or 
modular presentations. However, consistent with their previous studies, a signifi-
cant difference was found in favour of the modular strategy on learning time, as 
well as problem solving on similar and novel problems.
Gerjets et al.’s (2004,  2006) work suggesting that the modular approach reduces 
element interactivity and intrinsic cognitive load compared to a molar approach is 
important and interesting. Nevertheless, the results do require replication because 
the experiments reported altered multiple variables simultaneously and so we can-
not know the true cause of the modular superiority. For example, the molar 
approach used an equation while the modular approach placed its emphasis on the 
logical rationale of the procedure without reference to an equation. The difference 
between the two conditions may have been caused by this difference or any of the 
other differences in procedure between the molar and modular approach. Further 
experiments that alter only one critical variable will need to be carried out.

208
16 Altering Element Interactivity and Intrinsic Cognitive load
In the Gerjets, Scheiter, and Catrambone studies, the complexity of the tasks 
themselves were not reduced. Only the presented solutions were reduced in com-
plexity. A study by Nadolski, Kirschner, and van Merriënboer (2005) adopted a 
similar strategy. In this study, law students were required to learn how to conduct a 
law plea. In a complex learning environment that included whole-task training, sup-
port tools and feedback, three groups of learners were compared who received 
identical conditions, apart from the number of solution steps provided in worked 
examples. It was found that students who received an intermediate number of steps 
outperformed students who received the maximum number or minimum number of 
steps. In the case of too many steps, Nadolski et al. argued that the learning task 
became less coherent. Reduced coherence may occur because of increased element 
interactivity. In the case of too few steps, the researchers did not offer a plausible 
reason for this effect, but presumably not enough information was provided for 
these learners to construct meaningful schemas.
Isolated Elements Effect
Reducing intrinsic cognitive load through a scaffolded progression from learning 
with simpler part tasks to more complex full tasks has proven effective. Some 
experiments have used a related procedure in which some of the interacting ele-
ments have been removed from the full task resulting in a sequence of isolated, 
non-interacting elements that needed to be processed and learned. This instruc-
tional strategy has been called the isolated/interacting-elements effect but in this 
book will be referred to by the simpler name, the isolated elements effect.
In the first study of this issue within a cognitive load theory framework, Pollock, 
Chandler, and Sweller (2002) used a strategy to directly reduce intrinsic cognitive load. 
In two experiments, apprentices were taught how to conduct electrical safety tests. To 
learn how to conduct these tests, students must understand the complex interactions 
that take place between the appliance to be tested (e.g. a kettle), voltmeter settings, 
insulation, electrical leads, set criteria for safety readings and the consequences of 
incorrect readings. To isolate elements in this domain, Pollock et al. initially focused 
instruction on explaining only basic procedural steps. For example, for the insulation 
resistance test, nine steps were demonstrated in a worked example outlining consecu-
tive procedures, such as ‘Set the metre to read 500 volts’ (Pollock et al., p. 65). In 
contrast, the interacting-elements group received this instruction, as well as other rel-
evant explanatory information to fully understand all aspects of the task: ‘By setting 
the meter to read 500 volts, a larger than normal average voltage will be introduced 
into each circuit in order to test the appliance under a heavy load. Set the metre to read 
500 volts’ (p. 65). It was estimated that for novices in this domain (first year electrical 
trainees), seven elements would have to be simultaneously processed in the isolated-
elements condition, but 16 in the interacting-elements condition.
In the second phase, the learning materials were repeated but both groups received 
the instructional materials with full interacting elements. Thus, the isolated-elements 

209
Isolated Elements Effect
group experienced a progression from low to high element interactivity and intrinsic 
cognitive load, while the interacting-elements group experienced the high element 
interactivity and intrinsic cognitive load conditions twice. Results indicated that for 
high element interactivity test problems, the isolated-elements group significantly 
outperformed the interacting-elements group. For low element interactivity tasks, 
there was a similar but not statistically significant trend. Significant differences on 
self-rating measures of cognitive load using a difficulty rating scale indicated that 
cognitive load was lower for the isolated-elements group. However, these differences 
only were found for novices in the domain. For students with greater knowledge, no 
significant differences were found.
Pollock et al. recognised that the method they used to isolate elements had a high 
reliance on procedural knowledge, which may have influenced the overall results. 
Consequently, they designed two further experiments where more conceptual 
understanding was required. In these experiments, students were required to learn 
about an electrical circuit powering an industrial oven. Both groups received a cir-
cuit diagram with numbered text points. During the first phase of instruction, the 
isolated-elements group had less text associated with fewer interacting elements. 
The interacting-elements group had more text and a greater emphasis on cause and 
effect relations underpinning the whole system. Results from these two experiments 
were similar to the previous experiments. For students with high prior knowledge, 
no significant differences were found between the two strategies, with possible 
trends in favour of the interacting-elements group. In contrast, for learners with less 
prior knowledge, all measures favoured the isolated-elements group, with signifi-
cant differences found on high element interactivity tasks.
The results of Pollock et al. were consistent. On tasks that emphasised proce-
dures or concepts, isolating elements during an initial stage of learning was found 
to be effective. Both test scores and measures of cognitive load, particularly on high 
element interactivity tasks, supported this conclusion. However, this effect was only 
found with learners with low prior knowledge. Learners with greater prior knowl-
edge did not need this progression from low to high intrinsic cognitive load as they 
were capable of learning just as well from the more complex materials without 
prior exposure to the simpler material. These results correspond with the expertise 
reversal effect (see Chapter 12).
To examine the staged progression strategy further, Ayres (2006b) used an isolated-
elements approach in teaching basic algebraic concepts. Previous research by Ayres 
(2001, 2006a) found that bracket expansion tasks of the kind 4(3x − 6) – 5(7 − 2x) were 
high in element interactivity and found to be difficult for novice learners of algebra. To 
expand these brackets, only consecutive operations need to be performed; however, 
there is a high level of element interactivity caused by the way the numbers, signs, 
bracket operators and x variables are interrelated. Students need to decide what needs 
to be grouped together, when it needs to be grouped and how many calculations are to 
be completed overall. To create an isolated-elements environment, a set of worked 
examples was used that demonstrated only one calculation at a time. For example, 
using the problem above, students could study how to complete the fourth calculation 
−5 × (−2x) only. Then, using the paired worked-example strategy (see Chapter 8), 

210
16 Altering Element Interactivity and Intrinsic Cognitive load
­learners practised using a similar calculation placed in the same position of a paired 
expansion task similar to 4(3x − 6) – 5(7 − 2x). In an identical fashion, students 
received worked-example pairs on the three other calculations.
This isolated-elements strategy was compared with an interacting-elements 
strategy where students were given full worked-example pairs showing all four 
calculations together, and a phased group, where students switched from an isolated-
elements strategy to the full worked-examples strategy halfway through the acqui-
sition stage. The prior mathematical knowledge of participating grade 8 students 
was measured. In this 2 (high vs low ability) × 3 (isolated vs interacting vs phased 
strategy) design, a significant interaction effect was found (an expertise reversal 
effect, see Chapter 12). Students with the least mathematical ability benefited from 
the isolated-elements approach, whereas students with the higher levels of mathe-
matical ability benefited from the fully interacting worked-examples approach. The 
phased strategy did not provide a significant advantage for either level of ability. 
Notably, a difficulty rating scale as a measure of cognitive load collected post 
acquisition found that the isolated-elements approach was less difficult than the 
other two approaches, hence supporting the assumption of an overall reduction in 
cognitive load.
In a third study, Blayney, Kalyuga, and Sweller (2010) investigated the effec-
tiveness of an isolated-elements approach with first-year undergraduate students 
learning how to construct spreadsheet formulae for basic accountancy concepts. In 
this study, a two-phase strategy was used similar to that of Pollock et al. (2002). In 
the first phase, two groups of students learning how to determine a budget received 
either isolated-elements or interacting-elements instructions. This initial phase was 
followed by a second instructional phase where both groups received instruction in 
a fully interacting elements format. Both phases used worked-examples to keep 
extraneous cognitive load to a minimum.
For the interacting-elements presentation, the whole formula consisting of 
several sub-calculations was combined together within one spreadsheet cell. In this 
format, the formula consisted of the maximum number of interacting elements that 
needed to be considered at once. In contrast, the isolated-elements group received 
one or more intermediary steps corresponding to the required sub-calculation in 
separate spreadsheet cells before these were combined in a separate cell to give the 
final answer. In this isolated-elements format, each formula had fewer interacting 
elements. This group had more steps to complete but each step had relatively few 
interacting elements.
For students with low prior knowledge, the initial use of the isolated-elements 
strategy was found to be more effective than the initial use of the fully interacting 
elements approach. In contrast, for students with high levels of prior knowledge, no 
difference was found between the two approaches.
Overall, these three studies (Ayres, 2006b; Blayney et al., 2010; Pollock et al., 
2002) produced very similar results. Evidence emerged in each study that for low 
prior knowledge learners, use of an isolated-elements strategy is advantageous. 
That advantage disappeared or even reversed for higher prior knowledge learners. 
Reducing intrinsic load at an early stage for novices helps develop partial schemas 

211
4C/ID Model for Complex Learning
held in long-term memory (information store principle), which due to the 
environmental organising and linking principle can overcome working memory 
limitations (narrow limits of change principle) as learning continues. In contrast, 
learners with higher levels of prior knowledge can use the environmental organis-
ing and linking principle as exemplified by sufficiently developed schemas or 
partial schemas to allow them to deal with high levels of element interactivity. 
It is notable that these three studies used different learning tasks with very diverse 
groups of learners (grade 8 students, undergraduate accountancy students and 
trade apprentices). The fact that similar results have been obtained with different 
learners and different tasks suggests that the results may be reasonably robust.
4C/ID Model for Complex Learning
The strategies described above all reduce intrinsic cognitive load using a part- 
task methodology. This strategy reduces intrinsic cognitive load because a part 
task contains fewer interacting elements than a full, whole task. In the 4C/ID 
model developed by van Merriënboer and colleagues (see van Merriënboer, 
Clark, & de Croock, 2002; van Merriënboer, Kester, & Paas, 2006; van 
Merriënboer & Kirschner, 2007; van Merriënboer, Kirschner, & Kester, 2003), 
part tasks are an integral component of an overall instructional model designed to 
organise learning tasks effectively and efficiently. The 4C/ID model consists of 
the following four components: learning tasks, supportive information, proce-
dural information and part-task practice. Van Merriënboer et  al. (2006) sum-
marise learning tasks as the background of the training programme and are 
preferably taken from real-life scenarios: supportive information provides infor-
mation that helps learners to problem-solve and reason in the domain, procedural 
information is provided to help learn routine procedures that need to be carried 
out under specific conditions and part-task practice is for routine tasks that need 
to become highly automated.
Even though this model is more focused on educational programmes than the 
design of instructional materials (van Merriënboer & Sluijsmans, 2009), it offers 
directions in reducing extraneous as well as intrinsic, cognitive load. By providing 
support and guidance when needed (just-in-time support) extraneous load is low-
ered. As expertise is increased, these scaffolding techniques are reduced according 
to a fading-guidance strategy (Renkl & Atkinson, 2003; van Merriënboer et al., 
2003; see Chapter  13). Intrinsic load is lowered by using part tasks. However, such 
tasks are not necessarily a subset of original whole tasks, but can be basic skills that 
need to be mastered such as the multiplication tables. The initial presentation of 
part tasks helps consolidate procedures or rules, which can be applied to whole 
tasks at a later stage (van Merriënboer et al., 2002).
Nevertheless, in contradiction to the above approach emphasising a part-whole 
sequence, van Merriënboer et al. (2003) also suggested that under some circum-
stances, part-task practice should occur after whole tasks have been introduced, 

212
16 Altering Element Interactivity and Intrinsic Cognitive load
thus grounding the practice on part tasks in the context of a bigger picture. A key 
feature of the 4C/ID model is that initial tasks should be whole and meaningful, 
exposing the learner to a holistic view immediately (van Merriënboer et  al., 
2006). From this perspective, the model adopts a whole-part approach. Van 
Merriënboer et al. (2003) point out that a part-task approach may not be effective 
for complex learning environments that require the integration of a number of 
skills, knowledge and attitudes (see van Merriënboer & Kester, 2008, for a sum-
mary of the evidence). For complex motor tasks and many professional real-life 
tasks, it is essential that the learner understand and learn the relevant interactions 
and coordinations between the various subtasks. By learning the subtasks in iso-
lation, these interactions may be missed. To ensure that all such interactions are 
identified, the 4C/ID model proposes that whole tasks should be presented initially, 
although in a more simplified (reduced intrinsic load) format before progressing 
to full complexity.
The Variability Effect
The above studies were all designed to decrease intrinsic cognitive load. 
Nevertheless, unlike extraneous cognitive load that should always be decreased 
where possible, intrinsic cognitive load should be optimised rather than decreased. 
If intrinsic cognitive load exceeds working memory capacity, learning and problem 
solving will be disrupted. Equally, if intrinsic cognitive load requires fewer cogni-
tive resources than are available in working memory and the number of interacting 
elements relevant to the task can be increased, then learning will be enhanced by 
increasing intrinsic cognitive load.
When discussing the worked-example effect (see Chapter 8), many of the 
reviewed studies included transfer tasks. Cognitive load theory, in common with 
many other frameworks, has recognised the importance of testing for transfer. 
Showing that learned knowledge and skills can be applied to problems belonging to 
a different category to those previously studied may indicate that more sophisticated 
and flexible schemas have been constructed. Although early research indicated that 
worked examples could successfully foster transfer skills, researchers have investi-
gated methods of structuring examples to specifically promote transfer. One such 
method is called variability, or varied context examples (Clark, Nguyen, & Sweller, 
2006) which leads to the variability effect.
The variability effect occurs when example-based instruction (borrowing and 
organising principle) that includes highly variable examples results in enhanced 
transfer performance compared to less variable, more similar examples. Exposure 
to increased variability can be hypothesised to result in students learning how to 
differentiate relevant and irrelevant features of worked examples (van Merriënboer 
& Sweller, 2005). Through high variability, learners may be able to abstract sche-
mas to transfer to long-term memory that incorporate knowledge of principles and 
learn when to apply those principles (Clark et  al., 2006) via the environmental 
organising and linking principle, thus enhancing transfer.

213
The Variability Effect
Paas and van Merriënboer (1994) conducted the first investigation of variability 
from a cognitive load perspective. In this study, secondary technical school students 
were required to apply computer-controlled machinery programming to learn sev-
eral geometrical principles such as Pythagoras’ theorem. Low variability was 
achieved by using problems that only differed by changing the values of the prob-
lems, whereas for high variability, both values and problem formats were changed. 
For example, consider the problems in Fig. 16.1. The worked example shown in 
Fig. 16.1a gives an example of the calculation of the distance between two points. 
Figure  16.1b demonstrates a low variability example because only the numbers 
If P is (1, 1) and Q is (4, 5), find the length of PQ.
If P is (2, 3) and Q is (8, 11), find the length of PQ.

have changed, and the formula is applied in exactly the same way. In contrast, 
Fig. 16.1c shows a high variability example because the formula has to be applied 
and then manipulated to find the unknown ‘x’, as the solution demonstrates. There 
is considerable more thinking needed to solve this problem, including applications 
of algebra.
In Paas and van Merriënboer’s study, using a 2 × 2 group design (worked 
example–high variability, worked example–low variability, problem solving–high 
variability, problem solving–low variability), it was found that worked examples 
led to better transfer with less mental effort than conventional problem solving. 
There was also an interaction indicating that variability was effective in the worked 
examples format but not effective in the conventional, problem-solving format. The 
high variation–worked examples combination had superior transfer outcomes than 
the other groups.
Quilici and Mayer (1996) also found that variability could accelerate the transfer 
of knowledge. In this study, which investigated the learning of statistics, two main 
strategies were compared. One strategy varied surface features but did not vary 
structural features, the second did not vary surface stories but did vary underlying 
structures. It was found that the strategy that varied structure led to superior sorting 
performance based on structure, and learners presented examples with increased 
structural variability were better able to select and categorise the correct statistical 
test to be used. It was concluded that categorising success could be improved by 
presenting examples where students can focus on differences in structural features 
instead of surface features.
A different form of variability is called contextual interference and involves the 
sequencing of problems. If problems are positioned next to each other in time and 
require the same set of skills for solution, then contextual interference is low. In 
contrast, if problems are positioned next to each other and require a different set of 
skills then contextual interference is high. Van Merriënboer et al. (2002, p. 14) used 
the following example to demonstrate the difference. Low contextual interference 
can be produced by blocked practice where the skills required for one problem are 
practised before moving on to a different problem (e.g. B-B-B, A-A-A, C-C-C). 
High contextual interference can be created by randomly linking together practise 
on the different skills (e.g. C-A-B, B-C-A, B-A-C).
De Croock, van Merriënboer, and Paas (1998) compared a high and low contex-
tual approach in a study where learners were required to troubleshoot system fail-
ures. They found that learners who practised troubleshooting in a high contextual 
interference environment showed superior transfer skills than those who practised 
under lower interference. The advantage came at a cost. Students who practised 
under high interference conditions had delayed acquisition of the skill. De Croock 
et al. predicted that high contextual interference would generate more cognitive 
load. Although performance results concurred with this prediction, mental effort 
ratings during acquisition did not show any differences. In analysing this finding, 
van Merriënboer et al. (2002) argued that no mental effort differences were found 
because of the low complexity of the troubleshooting tasks.
In a later study, van Merriënboer et al. (2002) used a more complex learning 
environment in which engineering students learned various programming skills. 

215
Variability and Increased Intrinsic Cognitive Load
In Experiment 2, a high contextual interference group needed more time and 
invested more mental effort than a low contextual interference group during acqui-
sition, thus providing evidence for increased cognitive load. Despite the increase in 
cognitive load, the high contextual interference group had fewer errors on a transfer 
test. Accordingly that increase in cognitive load was advantageous and so not due 
to extraneous cognitive load. There are theoretical reasons to suppose that the 
increase in cognitive load with increased variability is due to increases in intrinsic 
cognitive load leading to increases in germane load.
Variability and Increased Intrinsic Cognitive Load
The initial explanation for the advantages of increased variability was solely in 
terms of germane cognitive load (Paas & van Merriënboer, 1994; Sweller, van 
Merriënboer, & Paas, 1998). Van Merriënboer and Sweller (2005) further com-
mented that through variability, learners have the opportunity to engage in deeper 
processing, building more flexible and well-connected schemas. That explanation 
is valid using the definition of germane resources used in this book (see Chapter 5). 
Recall that germane cognitive load is defined in terms of the working memory 
resources devoted to intrinsic cognitive load. We suggest that increases in variability 
increase intrinsic cognitive load and so on this formulation, additional working 
memory resources must be devoted to intrinsic cognitive load.
When variability is altered, so is the nature of the task, resulting in changes in 
intrinsic cognitive load. When problem variability is low, learners only need to 
learn how to solve problems with a particular structure. They can ignore the ele-
ments associated with variations in deep structure because deep structure is rela-
tively constant. As variability increases, learners must take into account more and 
more elements associated with the various structures reflected in the problems and 
learn how to deal with those elements. Element interactivity and intrinsic cognitive 
load is increased with increased variability. That increase requires additional working 
memory resources devoted to dealing with this increased intrinsic load (germane 
resources). In effect, whenever variability is changed, the nature of the task facing 
learners changes with a concomitant change in element interactivity and intrinsic 
cognitive load. Learning how to deal with a greater range of problems increases 
knowledge that can, in turn, increase transfer performance to new tasks because the 
probability that the new task is similar to one already faced increases with vari-
ability. That result was obtained by Paas and van Merriënboer (1994).
Of course, increasing the number of interacting elements associated with intrin-
sic cognitive load only is a viable instructional strategy provided there is sufficient 
working memory capacity available to process the additional elements. If there is 
insufficient working memory capacity to handle the increased number of elements, 
increased variability will have negative rather than positive effects. Intrinsic cogni-
tive load must be optimised rather than simply increased or decreased and the 
optimum level of intrinsic cognitive load will depend on the judgement of an 
instructor concerning the knowledge levels of learners. Higher knowledge levels 

216
16 Altering Element Interactivity and Intrinsic Cognitive load
may free sufficient capacity to enable an increase in intrinsic cognitive load without 
overwhelming working memory.
In conclusion, increasing the variability of worked examples increases intrinsic 
cognitive load because learners must process the additional interacting elements 
associated with increased variability. In turn, the additional knowledge acquired 
due to increased variability should facilitate transfer, explaining the empirical 
findings.
Conditions of Applicability
Intrinsic cognitive load is dependent upon the knowledge of the learner. Low prior 
knowledge learners are restricted in their ability to chunk information together into 
schemas and for complex material, learners are forced to simultaneously process a 
large number of interacting elements in working memory. Thus, for these learners it 
can be very difficult to learn complex materials. Consequently, for learners with low 
prior knowledge, there are considerable advantages to providing a part-task approach, 
where intrinsic load is considerably reduced by providing first a task with a lower 
level of element interactivity followed by a more complete task with higher levels of 
element interactivity. Having reduced intrinsic load, learners are more able to under-
stand and learn the materials, and to develop partial schemas, enabling them to even-
tually progress to whole tasks. In contrast, learners with greater prior knowledge are 
able to process more interacting elements simultaneously without a heavy working 
memory load, and do not need the same scaffolding strategies provided by a part-task 
approach. In general, a part-whole sequence is an effective learning strategy.
On the other side of this particular ledger, if element interactivity is low, learning 
might be facilitated, by increasing intrinsic cognitive load through an increase in 
variability. As is the case for part-whole sequencing, changing element interactivity 
levels to an optimum level should only be done if knowledge levels are appropriate. 
Increasing variability when learners are having difficulty processing low variable 
information can be expected to decrease rather than increase learning.
Instructional Implications
The instructional implications are very clear. Learners with low prior knowledge 
may have difficulty learning complex materials unless element interactivity is low-
ered. Complexity can be lowered by a number of strategies such as using isolated 
elements. Learning of complex materials can be achieved by reducing element 
interactivity initially and then carefully progressing to full element interactivity in 
a simple-to-complex sequence. Similarly, optimal levels of element interactivity 
may be achieved by increasing variability of examples. The increased knowledge 
acquired as a consequence can be beneficial when solving transfer tasks.

217
Conclusions
In Chapter 5, we distinguished between understanding and learning by rote in 
terms of element interactivity. While learning with understanding is reserved for 
high element interactivity information, learning by rote can be applied to either low 
or high element interactivity information. When dealing with low element interac-
tivity information, we assume that learning by rote is unavoidable because no other 
form of learning is available. In the studies reported in this chapter dealing with 
part-whole learning, element interactivity was reduced to the point that some 
aspects of the task could be easily rote-learned, with little understanding. However, 
having gained a degree of automation of such tasks, be they subgoals, vital proce-
dures or subtasks, the partial knowledge acquired, even if rote-learned, acts as a 
crucial link in developing full understanding when learners are then exposed to 
complete tasks with all required interacting elements.
It can be beneficial to use a worked-examples approach in tandem with reducing 
intrinsic load. As previously discussed in Chapter 8, worked examples reduce extra-
neous cognitive load, and therefore a combination of both worked examples and 
reduced element interactivity can provide an ideal learning environment with a reduced 
cognitive load.
Conclusions
The studies reported in this chapter, conducted in different domains with a variety 
of learners, all have one thing in common: they optimised intrinsic cognitive load 
by either decreasing or increasing it. Decreasing intrinsic cognitive load was com-
monly accomplished through a sequence of simple to complex processing. 
Although the researchers have used different designations to describe the methods 
used such as pre-training, focusing on subgoals, separating procedural and concep-
tual processes, the net result in all cases is reduced element interactivity. Increasing 
intrinsic cognitive was accomplished by increasing the variability of examples.
The effectiveness of reducing element interactivity depends on levels of learner 
prior knowledge, leading to the expertise reversal effect. Novice learners tend to 
benefit more from a strategy of reducing the extent to which elements interact than 
more knowledgeable learners in the domain. Domain-specific knowledge enables 
students to process more interacting elements at a time, thus making strategies that 
reduce intrinsic load redundant for such learners (see Chapter 10 on the redundancy 
effect and Chapter 12 on the expertise reversal effect). A similar expertise reversal 
effect has not as yet been demonstrated for the variability effect but on theoretical 
grounds, we might expect the effect to be obtainable. For learners with sufficient 
knowledge, high variability could be beneficial. For learners with low levels of 
prior knowledge, increases in variability could overwhelm working memory and so 
decrease rather than increase learning.
In Chapter 5, we indicated that intrinsic cognitive load cannot be altered because 
it is intrinsic to a particular task. Indeed, if the learning task and the knowledge 
levels of learners remain constant, intrinsic cognitive load also remains constant. 

218
16 Altering Element Interactivity and Intrinsic Cognitive load
Therefore, intrinsic cognitive load only can be altered by changing the nature of the 
task and the nature of what we expect students to learn (learning goals). Exactly, 
such a change occurred in all of the experiments described in this chapter. This 
change in what needs to be learned at a certain point in instruction can be contrasted 
to the consequences of altering extraneous cognitive load discussed in previous 
chapters. When varying extraneous cognitive load, what needs to be learned does 
not vary. Only the effectiveness and efficiency of learning the subject content vary 
when extraneous cognitive load is manipulated.
Similarly, by increasing the variability of examples, element interactivity and 
intrinsic cognitive load can be optimised by using the capacity of working memory 
to its full extent. An increase in learning eventuates.

The cognitive load effects previously described in this book are well established 
with significant supporting evidence collected across a number of studies and 
research groups. To complete our description of the various effects, we include two 
new effects in this chapter. Although their supporting research bases are in their 
infancy, there is mounting evidence that they are real, important cognitive load 
effects. In the next two sections, we describe the Transient Information Effect and 
the Collective Working Memory Effect.
The Transient Information Effect
Throughout this book we have argued that instructional designs that create an 
extraneous cognitive load are detrimental to learning. Central to this argument is 
the processing demands required of working memory. If working memory is 
engaged for example in conducting inefficient searches via the randomness as 
genesis principle, holding information while trying to process other information or 
integrating redundant information, its limited resources are consumed by pro-
cesses that fail to foster schema acquisition. We have seen how asking learners to 
problem solve with a fixed goal or deal with materials in a split-attention format 
creates an extraneous cognitive load. In contrast, the presentation of goal-free 
problems or worked examples not only reduces extraneous cognitive load by 
reducing unnecessary interacting elements associated with extraneous cognitive 
load but also facilitates germane working memory resources directed to dealing 
with intrinsic cognitive load. These strategies are effective because they allow suf-
ficient working memory resources (narrow limits of change principle) to be 
devoted to schema-building activities (information store principle). Schemas in 
turn can be used to drive action via the environmental organising and linking prin-
ciple. We have documented a number of instructional design flaws (e.g. split-
attention and redundancy) and suggested methods to avoid these procedures. In 
this section, we argue that there is a fundamental generator of extraneous cognitive

Working Memory Effects

load inherent in some modern, technologically driven instructional procedures. 
That excessive cognitive load can be caused by transient information.
Whenever a teacher orally explains something to a class or a pupil, whenever 
pupils talk to each other or hear speech, the information presented is transient. By 
its very nature, all speech is transient. Unless it is recorded, any spoken information 
disappears. If it is important information for the learner, then the learner must try 
to remember it. Remembering verbal information often can be more easily achieved 
if it is written down. Writing was invented primarily to turn transient oral informa-
tion into a permanent form. In the absence of a permanent written record, the 
learner may need to use a mental rehearsal strategy to keep information alive in 
working memory before it dissipates. The more information there is to learn, the 
more difficult it becomes to remember, unless it is written down, or students have 
additional access to a permanent record. Furthermore, if spoken information 
requires complex processing, then the demands made on working memory become 
even more intrusive. For example, if a teacher explains a point using several spoken 
sentences, each containing information that must be integrated in order to under-
stand the general gist, the demands made on working memory may be excessive. 
Information from one sentence may need to be held in working memory while 
information from another sentence is integrated with it. From this perspective, such 
information will create a heavy cognitive load. Accordingly, all spoken information 
has the potential to interfere with learning unless it is broken down into manageable 
proportions or supported by external offloads such as written notes.
We define the Transient Information Effect as a loss of learning due to informa-
tion disappearing before the learner has time to adequately process it or link it with 
new information. While the major characteristic of information that leads to the 
transient information effect is, of course, that the information is transient, there is 
another equally important characteristic. Not only must the information be tran-
sient, it also must be high in information content. Element interactivity must be 
high. Transient information that can be readily held and processed in working 
memory will not result in a transient information effect.
There are two procedures that, with the advent of modern technology, frequently 
are used to transform permanent into transient information. First, written information 
can readily be transformed into spoken information and as indicated above, that trans-
formation also transforms permanent into transient information. The modality effect 
(see Chapter 10) transforms written information into spoken information and so we 
might expect the modality effect to interact with the transient information effect. 
Second, static graphical information can be transformed into animated information. 
Static graphics are permanent while animation is transient. We will discuss both 
orally presented and animated information within a transient information context.
The Modality Effect and Transient Information
Combining auditory and visual information can have a positive effect on learning, 
as has been discussed in the chapter on the modality effect (see Chapter 10), provided 

221
The Transient Information Effect
the two sources of information refer to each other and are unintelligible in isolation. 
The advantage of using audio-visual rather than visual only information results 
in the modality effect. As previously indicated, the use of both auditory and visual 
channels reduces the load on the visual channel that occurs when all information is 
presented in visual form.
There are many independent demonstrations of the modality effect (see the 
Ginns, 2005b meta-analysis of 43 studies) but there also have been some puzzling 
exceptions. Some studies such as, for example, Tabbers, Martens, and van 
Merriënboer (2004) found visual only instructions to be superior to audio-visual 
instructions, thus obtaining a reverse modality effect. They used self-paced rather 
than system-paced conditions and suggested that the modality effect was more 
likely under system-paced conditions. Self-paced conditions provide time to trans-
fer information from working to long-term memory and so effects due to a working 
memory overload may be eliminated. Nevertheless, the transient information effect 
may provide an alternative explanation for the reverse modality effect. Tabbers 
et al. used relatively lengthy textual material. Such material, when presented in 
spoken form may overload working memory. When presented in written form, it 
may be possible to skim simple sections and concentrate on more complex sections. 
The resultant advantage for written information may generate the reverse modality 
effect due to the transience of auditory information.
Wouters, Paas, and van Merriënboer (2009) also failed to obtain a modality 
effect when using self-paced conditions. This experiment, similar to the Tabbers 
et al. study, used relatively long spoken or written text that may have imposed a 
heavier working memory load under transitory, spoken conditions than permanent, 
written conditions.
Schmidt-Weigand, Kohnert, and Glowalla (2010) obtained only limited evidence 
for a modality effect but no evidence for the self-paced hypothesis. Neither speed 
of presentation nor system-controlled or self-paced conditions affected the modality 
effect. While generally no advantage was found for spoken over written instruc-
tions, the spoken text condition was superior on a memory test of pictorial but not 
verbal information. The complexity of the textual/spoken instructions was provided 
as an explanation of the failure to obtain a modality effect, an explanation in accord 
with the suggestion that complex transient information may overload working 
memory more than permanent information.
Leahy and Sweller (in press) directly tested the transient information hypothesis 
and its relation to the modality effect in two experiments. In the first experiment, 
primary school children were taught how to read temperature–time graphs that indi-
cated temperature changes during the day. Much of the verbal information was 
presented in lengthy chunks. The results indicated a strong, reverse modality effect 
with the written information superior to the spoken information. The second experi-
ment used exactly the same material except that it was divided into much smaller 
chunks. In this experiment, a conventional modality effect was obtained with audio-
visual information proving superior to visual only information. Furthermore, the 
time per word in the second experiment was longer than in the first and so it was 
unlikely that the modality effect was due to learners having insufficient time to pro-
cess the information. Rather, the shorter verbal information reduced the influence of 

222
17 Emerging Themes in Cognitive Load Theory: The Transient Information
transience when presented with spoken text. Learners could remember the spoken 
text when processing the diagrams resulting in a conventional modality effect. With 
the longer text of the first experiment, learners could not hold the spoken informa-
tion in working memory while processing the diagrams because there were too 
many interacting elements. It was easier to process the text in written than spoken 
form and so a reverse modality effect was obtained.
Transience when dealing with long, complex spoken information can overload 
working memory due to high element interactivity. That load can be reduced by 
presenting the information in written form resulting in the transient information 
effect. In written form, individual elements can be processed without the risk of 
totally missing other critical elements because of transience. Written information is 
permanent and so elements can be ignored at any given time and returned to later. 
Written information reduces effective element interactivity because it allows ele-
ments to be ignored until current elements have been processed.
It needs to be emphasised that the effect found by Leahy and Sweller only 
should apply to high element interactivity, biologically secondary information, as 
is the case for all cognitive load effects. We have no difficulty, for example, pro-
cessing very lengthy spoken information during conversations, listening to speeches 
or watching films. Such information does not impose a heavy, intrinsic cognitive 
load and so cognitive load theory and findings are inapplicable.
Instructional Animations and Transient Information
Instructional animations or dynamic visual representations also use technology to 
transform information from permanent to transient form. An animation, in its many 
forms, from cartoon character depictions to video recordings of real-life events, can 
run for a few seconds to several hours. From an instructional perspective, it may 
take considerable time to provide enough information in a suitable form for learners 
to understand a particular concept. Animations, by their very nature, are dynamic 
and consist of a series of frames. Whether viewed on a computer or a television 
screen, as frames roll from one to another, visual information disappears from sight 
and the spoken word is no longer heard. Regardless of how well information is 
integrated, if information from previous frames is needed to understand later 
frames, then a transient information effect will occur. As we will argue later, the 
transience of animated information may be a key factor in explaining why instruc-
tional animations have not produced the consistently positive effects that have been 
anticipated. As Hegarty (2004)  comments: ‘we have learned that improving educa-
tion is not a simple matter of adopting a new technology’ (p. 344). Our understand-
ing of how students learn from animations is far behind the technology advances 
themselves (Chandler, 2004). However, cognitive load theory may provide a better 
understanding of how students can learn effectively from animations, but first we 
will discuss some key aspects of animation research.

223
The Transient Information Effect
Animation Versus Static Presentations
A considerable amount of research has been conducted on the effectiveness of 
instructional animations. Much of this research has compared animations with 
static graphics (statics). The results have not been encouraging with many studies 
and reviews finding little advantage for animated instructional procedures (see 
Hegarty, Kriz, & Cate, 2003;  Schnotz, Böckheler, & Grzondziel, 1999).  A review 
by Tversky, Morrison, and Bétrancourt (2002) found little evidence that anima-
tions were consistently superior to static graphics. Instead, they found that many 
studies did not adequately create design formats with equivalent information. 
Consequently, advantages found for animated groups in some studies may have 
been simply due to more information presented in the animated than the static 
presentations. Tversky et al. (2002) concluded that for animations to be beneficial 
two principles must be followed. Firstly, according to the correspondence princi-
ple, there should be a very strong match between the structure and content of the 
animation, and that of the concept being represented. Secondly, according to the 
apprehension principle, the animation should be easily perceived and understood. 
However, they also noted that consistency with these two principles did not guar-
antee that an animation would be superior to its static equivalents. For example, 
statics have been found to be at least equal to, and sometimes superior to, anima-
tions in learning about mechanical systems (see Mayer, DeLeeuw, & Ayres, 2007; 
Mayer, Hegarty, Campbell, & Mayer, 2005) .
To explain why animated instructional designs have not led to the anticipated 
advantages, a number of possible reasons have been proposed. For example, Lowe 
(1999, 2003) argued that there often exists a conflict between perceptual salience 
and thematic relevance. Learners may need direct help in extracting domain-relevant 
information from an animation (Lowe, 2003). Koroghlanian and Klein (2004)  found 
that animation required more learners’ time than a static approach with no discern-
able learning differences. Furthermore they found that learners with high spatial 
abilities learned better in a static mode than in a dynamic one, with no differences 
found for learners with low spatial abilities. To explain this result, Koroghlanian and 
Klein proposed that while high spatial ability students had more cognitive resources 
available, they failed to make the necessary effort to integrate the various forms of 
information, which was consistent with the view of Schnotz et al. (1999). Hegarty 
et al. (2003) also argued that static diagrams could lead to more active learning. In 
a sequence of static diagrams, learners are required to mentally integrate the static 
diagrams to form a representation of the dynamic processes represented. It was sug-
gested that this mental integration results in more active learning and deeper pro-
cessing. Some researchers, consistent with the argument provided in this chapter, 
have also noted the transient nature of information. For example, Ainsworth and van 
Labeke (2004) observed that transience is a particular characteristic of dynamic 
representations that has ramifications for working memory load. Ainsworth and van 
Labeke used a previous analysis of animations by Stenning (1998), to point out that 
relevant previous states need to be held in working memory to integrate them with 

224
17 Emerging Themes in Cognitive Load Theory: The Transient Information
current states. Consequently, animations without user-control cannot be revisited, 
unlike static diagrams that usually are constantly accessible unless presented in a 
serial form with each static diagram replacing its predecessor.
Ainsworth and van Labeke’s argument is based on considerations of cognitive 
load. From time to time other researchers have also noted that animations might 
create a high cognitive load (see, e.g. Ploetzner & Lowe, 2004); however, this sug-
gestion has been one of several possible theoretical approaches considered and it 
has not been consistently applied. However, Ayres, Kalyuga, Marcus, and Sweller 
(2005), and Ayres and Paas (2007a, 2007b), have developed the cognitive load 
explanation further and constructed a more comprehensive theory, based on the 
transient information effect. By identifying information transience as a major prob-
lem in learning from animations, a number of conditions under which animations 
are effective can be predicted.
Some Conditions Under Which Animations Can Be Effective
Cognitive load theory has identified different sources of extraneous load that 
interfere with learning from static pictures and words. Violations of the basic 
principles of cognitive load theory result in the same learning decrements when 
dealing with animations. Most animations involve some combination of pictures 
and text, either spoken or written. Consequently, animated designs can be 
improved by using the previously described techniques for reducing extraneous 
cognitive load. For example, the split-attention, modality and redundancy effects 
need to be considered. Furthermore, animations also can be improved by cueing 
or signalling information because learners may have difficulty extracting the 
relevant information from an animation (Lowe, 2003). Many studies have shown 
the effectiveness of strategies that use cueing or signalling techniques (Boucheix 
& Guignard, 2005; De Koning, Tabbers, Rikers, & Paas, 2007; Mautone & 
Mayer, 2001; Moreno, 2007).
Nevertheless, in spite of these general improvements to the design of anima-
tions, extraneous load may also be created by transient information that may not be 
alleviated by other cognitive load effects. The following sections examine some 
strategies that have been used to improve the effectiveness of animations.
Learner Control.  If transience of information creates problems in learning from  
an animation, then potentially a simple solution is to stop or slow down the anima-
tion. Providing an appropriate speed of animation can be achieved by giving an 
appropriate level of control to the learner. Slowing or stopping the flow of informa-
tion that has to be simultaneously processed lessens the load on working memory. 
Evidence in support of this strategy has been found in several studies. Mayer and 
Chandler (2001)  found that learners performed better with than without control over 
the animation. Control in this case allowed learners to stop and restart the instruc-
tional sequence. In a more dynamic use of interactivity, Schwan and Riempp (2004)  
compared a continuous video recording of knot tying with an interactive version. 

225
The Transient Information Effect
Learners in the interactive group were able to stop the animation at any time, change 
its speed, and even play it backwards. Results indicated that the interactive group 
developed a better understanding of the processes observed and were able to tie the 
knots with less practice.
Hasler, Kersten, and Sweller (2007) found that learner control , either as a 
pause and continue facility or as the restart of a predefined segment facility, led to 
superior learning than a continuous animation with high element interactivity 
materials. Learners who had access to these facilities rarely actually stopped the 
animation. So there was little difference from the continuous animation condition. 
The availability of a stop–start facility alone was sufficient to activate different 
cognitive processes even if the facility was not used. Bétrancourt (2005) argued 
that complete control of an animation should benefit more advanced learners only, 
as they have the necessary monitoring skills to know when to stop the animation. 
In the Hasler et al. study, the participants were novices in the domain, and there-
fore the findings support Bétrancourt’s prediction that the learners would not use 
the stop–start function. Nevertheless, even though the learners did not use the 
facility, they still benefited from it.
Segmenting.  The importance of complexity when considering the transient  
information effect applies equally to animations as to speech. As indicated when 
discussing the transient properties of speech, transience only is likely to be a prob-
lem when dealing with lengthy, complex information incorporating high element 
interactivity. Short, simple, low element interactivity information is less likely to 
cause a working memory overload even if it is transient. It can be held and pro-
cessed in working memory either during or even after its presentation. As occurred 
in the case of Leahy and Sweller’s (in press) experiments on the modality and 
reverse modality effects discussed above, we should not expect transience caused 
by animation to constitute a problem when dealing with very short sequences. 
Indeed, we suggest that at least some of the variability in the effectiveness of ani-
mations compared to static graphics is due to the length and complexity of the 
material presented. Short animations may be superior to the equivalent static graph-
ics while long animations may be worse than static graphics. This hypothesised 
effect only should apply to high element interactivity material.
We can vary the length of animations by the use of segmentation. Just as stop-
ping an animation under user-control can reduce the effect of transient information, 
so can segmenting it into smaller pieces. The less information that has to be held in 
working memory and integrated with future information, the more likely it is that 
learning can occur. Consequently, segmenting an animation into smaller sections is 
one method to reduce such load. For example, Mayer, Moreno, Boire, and Vagge 
(1999) demonstrated that the temporal split-attention effect would disappear if 
animations and narratives were divided into smaller segments (see Chapter 9). 
Florax and Ploetzner (2010)  also found evidence that split-attention was moderated 
by the amount of information presented. Mayer and Chandler (2001) showed that 
an animation subdivided into segments generated superior learning outcomes than 
the same animation that was run continuously without segmentation. As described 
in the previous section, Mayer and Chandler used a pause and restart procedure that 

226
17 Emerging Themes in Cognitive Load Theory: The Transient Information
linked user-control to segmenting. Considerable evidence that segmenting helps 
learners to deal with the working memory overload generated by animations has 
been found (see Boucheix & Guinard, 2005; Hasler et al., 2007; Moreno, 2007; 
Spanjers, van Gog, & van Merriënboer, 2010).
Prior Knowledge.  Prior knowledge allowing use of the environmental organis­
ing and linking principle has a similar effect on instructional effectiveness of ani-
mations to that of reducing the length and complexity of information and so might 
be expected to have a similar effect to segmenting information. Both prior knowl-
edge and segmenting can reduce the complexity of information by reducing the 
number of interacting elements with which learners must deal. Ayres et al. (2005) 
argued that learners with higher levels of prior knowledge may be able to deal with 
the transient information generated by animations better than learners with lower 
levels of prior knowledge. It was anticipated that prior knowledge would allow 
learners to more readily chunk information that has to be stored temporarily in 
working memory, leaving more spare capacity available for learning. Kalyuga 
(2008a) found evidence in support of this hypothesis. In a 2 (static vs animation) × 
2 (experts vs novices) design, learners who were more knowledgeable in mathemat-
ics learned more with an animated format than an equivalent static format, while 
novice students learned better using the static than the animated format. The 
Kalyuga findings are in accord with an expertise reversal effect (see Chapter 12). 
This effect has also been found in studies that have investigated segmentation of 
animations. Both Boucheix and Guinard (2005) and Spanjers et al. (2010) found 
that the advantages of segmenting disappeared for learners with high levels of 
prior knowledge, suggesting that the strategy was redundant for such learners. Low 
knowledge learners need segmenting to reduce a high working memory load in 
order to overcome the effects of transience while higher knowledge learners do not 
need a reduction in working memory load because their knowledge itself reduces 
the load.
As was the case with the presentation of spoken information, reducing the ele-
ment interactivity associated with transient animations should reduce cognitive 
load and facilitate learning. Learner control, segmentation and prior knowledge all 
have the effect of reducing the number of interacting elements with which learners 
must deal. That reduction can ameliorate the negative effects of transience when 
using animated instructional presentations. Of course, as is the case for speech, if 
an animation does not impose a heavy cognitive load due to transient, interacting 
elements, the need to reduce that load may be eliminated. In the next section, we 
suggest one set of circumstances where many interacting elements can be readily 
handled by the human cognitive system.
Learning Human Movement or Motor Skills: A Special Case
Despite some early pessimism about the impact of instructional animation, a meta-
analysis by Höffler and Leutner (2007)  did find a number of studies where anima-
tions had produced better learning outcomes than static equivalents. In particular, 

227
The Transient Information Effect
they found that if animations were highly realistic or involved learning about 
perceptual-motor knowledge, then they could be more effective than static dia-
grams. In fact, the condition with the largest effect size was on perceptual-motor 
tasks such as disassembling a machine gun (Spangenberg, 1973). Two studies, 
based on a cognitive load theoretical framework and featuring hand manipulation 
tasks, have provided additional evidence that human movement could be a special 
case in overcoming the negative effects of transient information.
In the first study, Wong et al. (2009) compared an animated and static approach 
in learning to make origami shapes. In the animated format learners simply 
observed a sheet of paper being folded into the target shape in a continuous pre-
sentation. In contrast, the static group for the same amount of time studied a 
series of key frames taken from the animation. On a test to physically make the 
origami shape, the animated group made more successful completions than the 
static group in both experiments. In the second study Ayres, Marcus, Chan, and 
Qian (2009) compared the effectiveness of the two formats in tying knots and 
solving puzzle-rings. Again, the animated groups performed better than the static 
groups in physically completing the tasks. In a second experiment, subjective 
cognitive load measures were collected, showing that the animated group found 
the task easier than the static group, suggesting that the animation strategy cre-
ated less cognitive load.
Arguel and Jamet (2009) used first-aid materials to find additional support for 
human movement as a special case. A characteristic of many first-aid strategies is 
that they involve manipulating the human body, for example manoeuvring the 
patient’s body into different positions according to the specific illness or accident. 
In teaching learners about first-aid techniques, Arguel and Jamet found that an 
animated format was superior to a static format.
The results of comparisons between animations and static graphics when dealing 
with human movement seem to favour animations. This result contrasts with the 
results of tasks depicting the movement of mechanical or abstract entities that do 
not include human movement. The evidence strongly suggests that the transience 
associated with animation depicting human movement can be much more easily 
overcome than the transience depicting mechanical movement that does not involve 
human movement. There are theoretical reasons for these results based on human 
cognitive architecture.
The Role of Biologically Primary Knowledge
The findings reported above in learning domains associated with motor move-
ment, as well as the meta-analysis of Höffler and Leutner (2007) suggest that 
information transience caused by animation has a different effect to information 
transience caused by mechanical, non-human movement. Specifically, we appear 
to be able to process much larger amounts of information without strains on work-
ing memory when human movement is involved. From a theoretical perspective, 
transience only should be a problem when we must deal with large amounts of 

228
17 Emerging Themes in Cognitive Load Theory: The Transient Information
information that may exceed working memory capacity. Why should the amount 
of information with which working memory can deal be larger for tasks involving 
human movement?
To provide a plausible explanation, van Gog, Paas, Marcus, Ayres, and 
Sweller (2009) used an interdisciplinary approach combining evolutionary bio-
logical theory and neuroscience within a CLT framework (Ayres & Paas, 2009). 
As previously argued in Chapter 1, biologically primary knowledge can be 
acquired quite effortlessly (Geary, 2007, 2008). We suggest that imitating human 
movement is a biologically primary task. Humans have evolved to observe and 
copy various forms of human movement and motor skills. It is feasible that such 
skills might be essential in our survival and development. If imitating human 
movement is a biologically primary task, then learning based on imitating 
human movement can occur with less impact on working memory resources, 
helping to overcome the transient information associated with animations. We 
may have evolved to readily process the interacting elements associated with 
human movement. In contrast, learning about mechanical systems, which are not 
related to human movement, may have a much larger secondary knowledge com-
ponent requiring more effortful learning with a greater working memory load. 
We have not evolved to handle the interacting elements associated with the 
movement of machines, for example.
The Role of Mirror Neurons.  There are physiological grounds for suggesting  
that human movement might have a unique status. Van Gog et al. (2009) proposed 
mirror neurons as an explanatory mechanism for the superiority of animations 
over static graphics when learning human movement. Evidence has been collected 
indicating that mirror neurons enable humans to engage in imitative learning (see 
Blandin, Lhuisset, & Proteau, 1999). A number of relevant neuroscience effects 
have been observed. For example, brain-imaging techniques have shown that the 
human motor system has a mirroring capacity (see Rizzolatti & Craighero, 2004).  
The same cortical circuits that are activated in completing an action also are acti-
vated when observing someone else engaging in the same action. In other words, 
similar brain activities occur when doing or observing motor actions. These 
actions are not just imitated, but also incorporate understanding of the action 
(Rizzolatti, 2005; Rizzolatti & Craighero, 2004). Furthermore, evidence has been 
collected that learning even takes place from observing de facto human behaviour 
(e.g. a robot arm), provided the goal of the action is clear (Gazzola, Rizzolatti, 
Wicker, & Keysers, 2007) or listening to someone describe human movement 
activities (Tettamanti et al., 2005).
These findings suggest that we may have evolved to imitate human movement 
with the mirror neuron system providing the physiological mechanism. If so, ani-
mation incorporating human movement may make heavy use of the biologically 
primary system thus reducing the role of working memory limitations. It may be 
recalled that working memory limitations apply primarily to the biologically sec-
ondary system. The negative effects of transience associated with animations may 
be reduced or eliminated when dealing with the human motor system with its close 
ties to biologically primary knowledge.

229
The Transient Information Effect
Conditions of Applicability
Whether or not transient information interferes with learning is entirely dependent 
on the cognitive load imposed by that information. Transient information that 
imposes a low cognitive load may be entirely beneficial if the positive effects of 
speech or animation outweigh the negative effects of transience. However, if the 
information is complex and lengthy, the effects of transience can be catastrophic 
and it should be avoided. Alternatively, information may be simplified by appropri-
ately segmenting it or ensuring that levels of expertise allow the information to be 
held and processed in working memory. If the information deals with human move-
ment, transience may not be a problem due to the heavy role of biologically primary 
knowledge in human movement.
Instructional Implications
The transient information effect indicates that under some conditions, transient 
information can have negative effects on learning. The effect will occur when infor-
mation that is needed to understand future information has disappeared from the 
learner’s view or hearing. In this case the learner is required to hold that initial 
information temporarily in working memory in order to integrate it with future infor-
mation at a later time. The result can be an increased cognitive load and reduced 
learning.
We should be wary of accidentally introducing transience as part of educational 
technology. The simple existence of a specific technological tool never is a suffi-
cient reason for its introduction in instruction. Transience introduced as speech or 
animation can substantially reduce learning compared to permanent forms of com-
munication such as written information or static graphics.
There can be considerable advantages to speech and animation because both are 
closely aligned with the biologically primary tasks we have evolved to handle. 
Nevertheless, for the biologically secondary knowledge that is central to most 
instructional curricula, cognitive load considerations should be remembered when 
introducing transient information.
Conclusions
Areas associated with transient information have produced mixed, difficult to 
interpret results. Consistently positive results for both the use of speech and the 
use of animations have not been obtained. Both speech and animations produce 
transient information. By considering transience from a cognitive load perspec-
tive, it appears possible to interpret and understand the findings. Cognitive load 

230
17 Emerging Themes in Cognitive Load Theory: The Transient Information
theory can explain why transient information is harmful and predict the types of 
instructional conditions that will lead to positive and negative learning outcomes. 
It can explain why instructional animations have led to variable results and why 
learning about human movement might be a special case. While work on the tran-
sience effect is in its infancy, considerable data has been produced and those data 
strongly suggest that a cognitive load theory interpretation may be promising.
The Collective Working Memory Effect
Research into learning by collaboration has a long history. It is usually approached 
from a motivational perspective (students are motivated by being grouped together) 
or from a social constructivist point of view (knowledge is best constructed by 
discourse between students). However, Kirschner, Paas, and Kirschner (2009a) 
have conceptualised collaborative learning from a cognitive load theory perspec-
tive. By considering collaboration between learners from a cognitive load theory 
viewpoint, a more fundamental explanation of when and how group work can be 
effective may be developed. The Collective Working Memory Effect is a new cogni-
tive load theory effect that occurs when individuals obtain higher learning outcomes 
through collaborative work than when learning alone.
Collaborative learning shifts cognitive load theory’s emphasis on the borrowing 
and reorganising principle from instructors or other knowledgeable experts to other 
learners. Rather than obtaining all or most information from instructors, the use of 
collaborative learning allows students to obtain much of their information from 
other students.
In a review of the literature on collaborative learning environments, Kirschner, 
Paas, and Kirschner (2009a)  concluded that the findings on the value of collabora-
tive learning are inconclusive. For example, they pointed out that some studies have 
shown that students become more actively engaged in the learning process and 
meta-cognitive skills are fostered. Other research has found collaborative learning 
to be inefficient considering the resources invested. Collaborative learning can also 
lead to social loafing in which some learners rely on others with little personal 
involvement in the collaboration. Kirschner et al. (2009a) identified four possible 
reasons why the results seem to be mixed. Firstly, group processes are often tested 
instead of direct measurement of learning outcomes. Secondly, carefully ran-
domised controlled experiments are rarely carried out. Thirdly, goals are often 
poorly defined, and fourthly, individual outcomes of group members are often not 
measured. To obtain more conclusive results, Kirschner et al. suggest that ‘research 
should base its claims on direct measurements of learning in a test phase, should 
study one important or fundamental aspect of the learning environment at a time, 
and should focus on performance of the group members rather than on the group as 
a whole’ (p. 35). Furthermore, they proposed that more consideration needs to be 
given to human cognitive architecture in order to fully understand the cognitive 
processes during collaborative learning.

231
The Collective Working Memory Effect
F. Kirschner et al. applied a cognitive load approach to collaborative learning by 
considering groups as information processing systems. In particular, they argued 
that a group of learners potentially have an expanded processing capacity because 
the intrinsic cognitive load caused by a task can be effectively subdivided across a 
number of cooperating working memories. For complex tasks that make substantial 
demands on working memory, sharing the load is predicted to provide a significant 
advantage. Kirschner, Paas, and Kirschner (2009b) also considered the role played 
by the transaction costs associated with collaboration. An important aspect of col-
laborative learning is sharing and coordinating information, which Kirschner et al. 
(2009b) refer to as transaction costs. Completing such transactions requires work-
ing memory resources, which have the potential to nullify the advantage of sharing 
working memory resources if they are too high. In other words, collaboration may 
come at an extra cost. Hence, transaction costs were considered an important factor 
in developing their theoretical model.
From the perspective of element interactivity, sharing the cognitive load means 
dividing the interacting elements between several working memories. Of course, 
such sharing will not be beneficial if the transaction costs exceed the advantages 
gained by off-loading some of the elements to other people. For complex tasks, 
there should be advantages to dividing the elements amongst several people because 
the transaction costs should be less than the cost of processing a large number of 
elements. For simpler, low element interactivity tasks, the transaction costs may 
exceed any reduction in element interactivity obtained by sharing.
Kirschner et al. (2009b) investigated a cognitive load approach in an experiment 
where learners in collaborative groups were provided only part of the essential 
information relevant to learning about biological heredity. Each member of a group 
of three had one third of the amount of information required to solve heredity prob-
lems during a learning phase. Consequently, information had to be shared between 
group members in order for problems to be solved. In contrast, individual learners 
were provided with all the elements of information necessary to solve the tasks. On 
a test phase, all learners were tested individually regardless of whether they initially 
learned in groups or individually. Results indicated that on tests of retention, indi-
viduals were more efficient learners, but on tests of transfer, group members 
learned more efficiently, where efficiency was calculated by combining perfor-
mance with mental effort measures (see Chapter 6). Using these cognitive load 
measures, Kirschner et al. (2009b) concluded that transaction costs were low and 
enabled group members to more deeply process the information elements, leading 
to better transfer results. Individual learners were only able to process the elements 
at more superficial levels, leading to better retention of surface information.
Kirschner et al. (in press) investigated the impact of problem complexity on the 
effectiveness of collaborative learning. They argued that research into collaboration 
suggests that group learning is superior on complex problem-solving tasks (Laughlin, 
Bonner, & Miner, 2002; Laughlin, Hatch, Silver, & Boh, 2006), but individual learn-
ing is superior on less complex tasks (Andersson & Rönnberg, 1995; Meudell, 
Hitch, & Kirby, 1992), a pattern also previously identified by Kirschner et  al. 
(2009b). To explain these effects, Kirschner et al. (in press) hypothesised that for 
simple tasks, individuals have enough working memory capacity to complete them, 

232
17 Emerging Themes in Cognitive Load Theory: The Transient Information
whereas group members have to deal with additional transaction costs. Thus, the 
collaborative approach may increase cognitive load on simple tasks, rendering group 
learning worse than individual learning. For more complex tasks, individuals may 
lack sufficient working memory capacity to complete the tasks, whereas group 
members can share the working memory load. If complexity of a task is sufficiently 
high, transaction costs may be minor in comparison to the reduction in cognitive 
load achieved by sharing the task. Even when transaction costs are added, group 
work members may experience a lower cognitive load than individual learners.
To test their hypothesis, Kirschner et  al. (in press) used a similar design to 
Kirschner et al. (2009b) using a biology topic but, rather than partitioning informa-
tion amongst group members, they provided all group members with all the neces-
sary information. Using levels of element interactivity (Sweller & Chandler, 1994) 
to measure problem complexity, a set of low-complexity and high-complexity learn-
ing tasks was designed. Test results from a 2 (individual vs group learning) × 2 
(high- vs low-complexity tasks) design indicated an interaction for mental effort 
scores. Mental effort was lower for students who learned individually rather than in 
groups on low-complexity tasks, but higher for students who learned individually 
rather than in groups on high-complexity tasks. The same interaction was also found 
on efficiency scores and solution times, but not raw performance scores. Kirschner 
et al. (in press) concluded that individual learning from low-complexity tasks was 
more efficient because these learners invested less mental effort than group learners. 
However, for more complex learning tasks, individual learning was less efficient 
than group learning because individual learners had to invest more mental effort.
The results from the two studies by Kirschner et al. (2009b, in press) are consis-
tent. Both sets of findings suggest that individual and group-based learning envi-
ronments generate different levels of cognitive load, leading to different learning 
efficiencies. These results are also consistent with other research findings indicat-
ing that collaboration is best suited to more complex learning tasks.
Two other recent studies have also taken a cognitive load approach to collabora-
tive learning. Retnowati, Ayres, and Sweller (2010) found that groups could benefit 
more from learning from worked examples rather than from problem solving (see 
Chapter 8). Zhang, Ayres, and Chan (2011) compared collaborative learning groups 
with an individualised learning approach on complex tasks to design webpages. 
Test results indicated that a collaborative approach was significantly better than an 
individual approach provided students were allowed some choice in the content of 
the webpage. Furthermore, cognitive load measures indicated that students working 
collaboratively experienced less mental effort than those working individually, 
consistent with the studies of Kirschner et al.
Conditions of Applicability
The collective working memory effect indicates that collaboration is more likely to 
be effective in learning tasks with high levels of element interactivity. For tasks low 

233
Conclusions
in element interactivity, individualised learning is more likely to lead to higher 
learning outcomes. The transaction costs are important in explaining the effectiveness 
of collaborative learning. If the reduction in cognitive load associated with collabo-
ration exceeds the transaction costs, collaborative learning is more effective than 
individual learning. If the transaction costs exceed the reduction in cognitive load 
due to collaboration, individual learning is superior to collaborative learning.
Instructional Implications
The studies reported in this section suggest that considerations of cognitive load 
may be important for understanding how collaborative learning works. The collec-
tive working memory effect indicates that collaboration can be used to share the 
working memory load on complex learning tasks. Under appropriate conditions, 
collaboration can enhance learning. Nevertheless, we need to recognise that under 
other conditions, individual learning may be superior to collaborative learning. 
Cognitive load theory can be used to predict and explain those conditions.
Conclusions
The collective working memory effect is a potentially new cognitive load effect 
with little data available at the time of writing. Nevertheless, it is an interesting 
effect that goes a long way towards making sense of an area that hitherto has made 
little sense with seemingly random experimental results. Cognitive load theory 
throws new light on collaborative learning and may have the potential to place it on 
a sounder footing with the collection of additional data.

Cognitive load theory differs from many instructional theories in several respects. 
First, the theory places a heavy reliance on the cognitive implications of biological 
evolution. As indicated in Part I, it divides knowledge into biologically primary and 
biologically secondary knowledge. Biologically secondary knowledge is a new, 
culturally important knowledge that we have not specifically evolved to acquire. 
Cognitive load theory is largely concerned with that biologically secondary knowl-
edge that is taught in schools and other educational and training institutions. The 
theory is concerned with biologically primary knowledge only to the extent that 
primary knowledge is needed for and influences the acquisition of secondary 
knowledge.
The second way in which cognitive load theory differs from many other instruc-
tional theories is its emphasis on human cognitive architecture, which is also treated 
from an evolutionary perspective as discussed in Part II. We suggest that both 
human cognition and evolution by natural selection are closely analogous, natural 
information processing systems. The theory considers our knowledge of human 
cognitive architecture to be critical to instructional design. Human cognitive archi-
tecture, based on the distinction between working and long-term memory, is not 
merely relevant to cognitive load theory, it is integral.
Our understanding of the role of working and long-term memory in human cog-
nitive architecture allows us to categorise sources of cognitive load as discussed in 
Part III. That categorisation provides the third way in which cognitive load theory 
differs from most other theories. Working memory and long-term memory are cen-
tral to human cognitive architecture when dealing with the biologically secondary 
information that is the subject of instruction. Working memory load is determined 
by element interactivity while element interactivity in turn is determined by an 
interaction between the contents of long-term memory and instructional material. 
A large number of interacting elements will impose a heavy working memory load 
unless they are incorporated in schemas held in long-term memory. Those interact-
ing elements can constitute either an intrinsic or extraneous cognitive load depend-
ing on the purpose and nature of the instruction. If they are essential to learning, 
they are classed as imposing an intrinsic cognitive load. If they are unnecessary to 
learning and are merely a function of a particular instructional procedure, they are 
Chapter 18

238

classed as imposing an extraneous cognitive load. In either case, they will be 
processed in an identical fashion by the cognitive system. Germane cognitive load 
also is dependent on element interactivity. To the extent that working memory is 
dealing largely with elements intrinsic to the task at hand, germane cognitive load 
is high. To the extent that working memory is dealing with elements extraneous to 
the task at hand, germane cognitive load is low.
The cognitive load effects of Part IV of this book flow from these relations and 
provide the ultimate purpose and justification for the preceding sections. Cognitive 
load theory was devised in order to allow us to generate the instructional effects 
discussed in Part IV and those effects provide the most important component of 
cognitive load theory. The cognitive load theory effects also indicate the fourth and 
fifth way in which cognitive load theory differs from many other theories.
The fourth manner in which cognitive load theory differs from most instruc-
tional theories is associated with its assumptions concerning the nature of teach-
able/learnable knowledge. Modern instructional theories tend to place a heavy 
emphasis on what can best be described as general cognitive strategies, including 
meta-cognitive and general problem-solving strategies. Such strategies are indepen-
dent of curriculum areas and so can be expected to function without close relations 
to the content being taught. Cognitive load theory assumes such strategies exist but 
most, even if not all, are biologically primary and so acquired easily, automatically 
and unconsciously at a young age. They usually cannot be readily taught, not 
because they are difficult to learn but rather, because they are easy to learn and so 
readily acquired by normal humans who have evolved to acquire such strategies 
without explicit instruction or assistance.
In contrast, cognitive load theory assumes that when learners are faced with new, 
complex curriculum areas, the difficulty those learners have functioning in the new 
environment is due largely to the complexity of the new material rather than to the 
absence of learned, general cognitive strategies. Evidence that most general strate-
gies already have been acquired by learners and do not need to be taught comes 
from the fact that there seem to be few general cognitive strategies that people fail 
to use automatically when working in a familiar environment. If general strategies 
are used in familiar contexts but not unfamiliar complex areas, it follows that the 
major difficulty faced by learners is likely to be in assimilating novel, complex 
information rather than learning general cognitive strategies. For this reason, cogni-
tive load theory places its primary emphasis on assisting learners to acquire 
domain-specific knowledge in complex areas rather than acquiring very general, 
cognitive strategies. Our cognitive architecture with its large long-term memory, 
limited working memory and a particular ability to obtain information from other 
people has evolved for this process. The cognitive load effects generated from this 
architecture and discussed in Part IV indicate relevant techniques.
The fifth way in which cognitive load theory differs from many instructional 
theories concerns the methodology used to test the hypotheses that resulted in the 
cognitive load effects of Part IV. The major point is that cognitive load theory does 
test hypotheses. Many instructional theories do not. All of the instructional effects 
discussed in Part IV have been tested using randomised controlled experiments in 

239
18 Cognitive Load Theory in Perspective
which commonly used instructional procedures act as a control condition with 
novel techniques generated by cognitive load theory acting as an experimental 
condition. Without exception, the instructional effects discussed in Part IV have 
been validated using randomised controlled experiments, usually replicated under 
a variety of conditions.
Critically, those experiments have conformed with the standard requirement of 
any scientific experiment in that only one variable was altered at a time, a require-
ment frequently flouted in educational research. For example, comparing ‘tradi-
tional’ classrooms with ‘inquiry-based’ classrooms is a pointless exercise. We 
know before such an experiment is carried out that a well-run, interesting lesson 
based on explicit instruction is almost invariably going to result in better learner 
outcomes than a chaotic, poorly designed inquiry-based lesson in which learners 
have little idea why they are in the class or what they are supposed to be doing. 
Equally, poorly organised, excruciatingly boring, explicitly presented instruction is 
highly likely to be worse than carefully organised, inquiry-based instruction with 
intelligently designed questions for learners to investigate, along with lots of assis-
tance when needed. Such comparisons can yield all possible results and are scien-
tifically worthless. In contrast, comparing for example, problem solving with 
worked examples will provide one procedure for validly testing the importance of 
guidance during learning. The two conditions are identical apart from learners hav-
ing to solve problems in one condition while they study the equivalent worked 
examples in the other condition. Any differences between the two conditions can 
be properly attributed to the difference between problems and worked examples 
rather than to a very large number of possible alternative factors. We believe there 
are always procedures available to run properly structured randomised controlled 
experiments in areas associated with cognitive processes and instructional design. 
There is never a justification for running experiments that cannot possibly isolate 
causal factors because multiple variables have been altered simultaneously.
Advocacy that is not based on data from validly run randomised controlled 
experiments can be badly misplaced. We need to know whether learners provided 
with new instructional procedures have superior outcomes than when using older, 
more conventional procedures. Randomised controlled experiments altering one 
variable at a time can provide that assurance. The cognitive load theory effects 
discussed in Part IV all are based on such experiments.
None of these five characteristics – the division of knowledge into biologically 
primary and biologically secondary knowledge, an emphasis on human cognitive 
architecture, the division of cognitive load into categories, the assumption of the 
primacy of domain-specific rather than domain-general cognitive strategies, and an 
emphasis on collecting data through the use of randomised controlled experiments – 
is necessarily unique to cognitive load theory. Individually, they can be found in 
other theories. Together, they may be unique to cognitive load theory. The assump-
tions of the theory have led directly to the data from randomised controlled experi-
ments that constitute the cognitive load theory effects discussed in Part IV of this 
book. Ultimately, the usefulness of those effects in providing instructional guide-
lines determines the usefulness of cognitive load theory.

240
18 Cognitive Load Theory in Perspective
The first cognitive load effect studied was the goal-free effect. The rationale of 
the effect depends on the assumption that the number of interacting elements that a 
problem solver must process when solving a conventional problem using means–
ends analysis can overwhelm working memory. One of the simplest ways of reduc-
ing element interactivity associated with conventional problem solving is to change 
the nature of problem solving by using goal-free problems. By reducing the speci-
ficity of a problem goal, means–ends analysis becomes impossible and the large 
number of interacting elements associated with the strategy is reduced. Learners, 
faced with a goal-free problem only consider each problem state along with any 
moves that can be made from that state, rather than attempting to compare a current 
state with a goal state and find problem-solving operators that will reduce differ-
ences between them.
Studies of the worked example and problem completion effects similarly were 
motivated by the assumption that conventional problem solving imposed an exces-
sive cognitive load because of the large number of interacting elements associated 
with a means–ends strategy. Rather than changing the problem-solving strategy to 
reduce the number of interacting elements, worked examples were used as a substi-
tute for problem solving, with completion problems having a similar effect for a 
similar reason.
Of the cognitive load effects outlined in Part IV, the worked example effect has 
attracted the most attention. It has been studied extensively by many investigators 
over many years. The attention the worked example effect has attracted is under-
standable. On the one hand, it conflicts with constructivist and inquiry-oriented 
views of instruction and on the other hand it is arguably the major cognitive load 
theory effect. The worked example effect indicates the unity and centrality of the 
cognitive architecture used by cognitive load theory and the connection of that 
architecture to instructional design. Studying worked examples should assist in the 
acquisition of domain-specific knowledge structures in long-term memory in 
accord with the information store principle. Worked examples provide information 
from other people in accord with the borrowing and reorganising principle. In con-
trast, as specified by the randomness as genesis principle, problem solving includes 
a high element interactivity, random generation and test procedure intended to pro-
vide a problem solution rather than to build organised knowledge structures in 
long-term memory. As suggested by the narrow limits of change principle, working 
memory is necessarily limited when dealing with novel information that requires 
random generation and test resulting in a heavy extraneous working memory load 
imposed by problem solving. That extraneous working memory load is due to the 
large number of interacting elements that must be manipulated by a conventional 
problem-solving procedure. Lastly, based on the environmental organising and 
linking principle, once information from a worked example is successfully stored 
in long-term memory, the characteristics of working memory change and that infor-
mation can be readily used in further problem solving and learning, explaining the 
advantage of worked examples over problem solving. As can be seen, the principles 
that underpin human cognitive architecture are closely tied to the worked example 
effect.

241
18 Cognitive Load Theory in Perspective
Other cognitive load theory effects are equally tied to the cognitive architecture 
used by cognitive load theory. The problem completion effect can be explained by 
the cognitive architecture in exactly the same way as the worked example effect. 
The split-attention, modality and redundancy effects all assume that information 
needs to be obtained from others via explicit instruction. That instruction needs to 
be structured so that the high element interactivity associated with split-source or 
redundant information is reduced to ensure optimal functioning of working mem-
ory and the transfer of information to long-term memory. In the case of split-
attention, element interactivity can be reduced by integrating multiple sources of 
information into a single source. As an alternative to integrating multiple sources 
of visual information, dual-modality presentation increases the functionality of 
working memory under dual-modality conditions. In the case of redundancy, mul-
tiple sources of information can be reduced by eliminating redundant information.
The expertise reversal effect derives from all of these effects while the guidance-
fading effect derives from the worked example effect. Both effects rely heavily on the 
environmental organising and linking principle. Once relevant information is stored 
in long-term memory it guides activity and so renders instructional guidance redun-
dant. Instructional guidance in the presence of the same information held in long-term 
memory merely increases the number of extraneous, interacting elements with which 
learners must deal, resulting in working memory inefficiency. When sufficient infor-
mation is stored in long-term memory, it may be better to practice imagining that 
information rather than attempting to process it during instructional presentations, 
leading to the imagination effect. Similarly, we may speculate that self-explanations 
are more likely to be effective once sufficient knowledge has been acquired to permit 
learners to engage in self-explanations without overloading working memory.
Element interactivity is readily associated with intrinsic cognitive load, and 
indeed element interactivity was first described within an intrinsic cognitive load 
framework. Without high element interactivity associated with a high intrinsic cog-
nitive load, any element interactivity associated with an extraneous cognitive load 
may not exceed working memory limits. If working memory limits are not 
exceeded, cognitive load effects cannot be obtained. The element interactivity 
effect occurs when a low intrinsic cognitive load results in a failure to obtain effects 
usually associated with an extraneous cognitive load.
There can be other consequences if element interactivity associated with intrinsic 
cognitive load is too low. If intrinsic cognitive load is low, the task can be changed 
by increasing, rather than decreasing, what students must learn. Increasing what 
students learn is accomplished by increasing the number of intrinsic, interacting 
elements. Increasing the variability of worked examples will change what students 
must learn. Instead of just learning to solve a particular class of problems, students 
must learn to solve several classes of problems and learn to distinguish between 
them. In this way element interactivity associated with intrinsic cognitive load is 
increased by increasing what students learn. Of course, this procedure only can be 
effective if spare processing capacity is available.
At the other extreme, if element interactivity is associated with a very 
high intrinsic cognitive load that itself exceeds working memory limits, reducing

18 Cognitive Load Theory in Perspective
element interactivity associated with an extraneous cognitive load may not be able 
to help. Intrinsic cognitive load itself may need to be reduced by changing what 
learners are expected to learn in the early stages of learning, leading to the isolated 
elements effect. This effect relies on presenting learners with high element interac-
tivity information but treating it as though it is low. The procedure results in stu-
dents learning material but not fully understanding it until further learning occurs.
These effects, based on both extraneous and intrinsic cognitive load, are well 
established. The cognitive architecture used by cognitive load theory is continuing 
to generate novel instructional effects that, at the time of writing, are less well 
established. The transient information effect suggests that if information is pre-
sented in a transient form as occurs when speech or animation is used, and if the 
information presented is high in element interactivity due to intrinsic cognitive 
load, any advantages due to the modality effect or due to animation effects may be 
neutralised or reversed due to the exceeding of working memory limits. Preliminary 
analyses of previous data along with new data provide support for the transient 
information effect.
The collective working memory effect provides another new cognitive load 
effect. If the element interactivity associated with the intrinsic cognitive load of a 
task exceeds working memory limits, sharing the task with others may render the 
task more tractable provided the transaction costs of sharing do not exceed the 
benefits of off-loading information to others.
Cognitive load theory, with its emphasis on human cognitive architecture, 
domain-specific knowledge and instructional effects based on randomised con-
trolled experiments has generated a considerable range of instructional procedures. 
The integration of these facets into a unified whole has been productive. Cognitive 
load theory is that unified theory. We believe the theory has the potential to alter 
our understanding of instructional procedures.
