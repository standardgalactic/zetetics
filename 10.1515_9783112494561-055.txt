Two-Dimensional Decorated Ising Model: The v-»oo Limit 
By 
L.L. GONfALVES3* 
The decorated Ising model with v -dimensional classical spins has been ex-
tensively studied in recent years / I to 3/. The main purpose in decorating the 
matrix lattice is to obtain more complex effective Ising systems which may 
present a richer phase diagram. 
The purpose of this letter is to consider the whole decorated two-dimen-
sional Ising model in the limitv+oo under suitable conditions. The one-dimen-
sional model has already been studied / 4 / and it was shown how it can be 
mapped onto the spherical model / 5 / . 
The Hamiltonian that we are going to consider can be written in the form 
1 f-i

is the v-th component of the clas-
sical vector spin S.. .i.i decorating the bond connecting site (i, j) to (i1, j1). We 
y > i j 
have assumed periodic boundary conditions. 
Adopting the same procedure used for the one-dimensional lathee /4/, in

order to consider the limit we assume IS.. .| .il = V 
and renormalize the

From the previous expression we can conclude that in the limit of interest 
all the thermodynamic functions of the two-dimensional system are identical to

the thermodynamic functions of a system composed of two independent one-di-
mensional spherical models with exchange constants 
and 2Jg. 
The mapping of the two systems can only be completed by determining the 
correspondence between the correlation functions. In order to obtain it let us 
consider the multiple classical spin correlation functions. We start by eval-
uating the 2n-spin correlation for consecutive spins on the same row, namely, 
< Si,ij +l SS +l,ij +2 
sij+2n-l,ij+2n^' which is given by

As we can see, the problem of evaluating multiple classical spin corre-
lations is equivalent to calculate multiple Ising spin correlations on the effective 
lattice. In the limit v-»oo they are easily obtained, since /8/

which is a result analogous to the one obtained for the one-dimensional system. 
The right-hand side of the previous equation is the square of the two-spin cor-
relation c. . 
of the one-dimensional spherical model with an exchange con-
j.j+n 
stant 2Jj /5/. 
Identically we can show that in the same limit, the 2n-spin correlation for 
consecutive spins on the same column is given by

and the (2n^ + 2n2)-spin correlation for 2n^ consecutive spins on the same row 
and 2n2 consecutive spins on the same column is

From the results shown in (19), (20), and (21) we can finally conclude that 
the decorated two-dimensional Ising model in the limit v-*oo is mapped onto two 
independent one-dimensional spherical models with exchange constants 2J^ and 
2Jg, respectively. Although the free energy of the decorated two-dimensional 
Ising model is equal to the free energy of two one-dimensional spherical mod-
els. 
the two-spin correlation functions are not equal in both models. The 
equality comes through more complicated relations which involve multiple cor-
relation functions of one model and the square of two-spin c orrelation of the other.
