just 21/2" larger than a "compact" 
... yet it measures up to the design 
philosophy of the mighty Patrician! 
The difference between full -sized sound and 
compact compromise is measured in just a 
few cubic inches ... inside the new Marquis 
300! This modest extra volume has allowed 
E -V engineers to extend useful bass response 
smoothly -up to an octave more than many 
popular "bookshelf" speaker systems! 
But the Marquis has more than bass ... it 
has balance! Balance that results from three 
precision component speakers exactly 
matched to each other and to the magni- 
ficent Marquis enclosure. 
Don't look for revolutionary or radical de- 
signs in the Marquis 300. For this system 
is the evolutionary product of over 11 years 
of specialized electro- acoustical research. 
Starting with the famous E -V Radax dual- 
cone 12" speaker for bass and mid - 
bass, we have added the outstanding 
performance of the E -V 5" cone mid- 
range speaker plus the brilliance of the re- 
nowned Super -Sonax VHF tweeter. These 
popular and proved components have been 
housed in an enclosure whose tuned acous- 
tical phase inverter permits highly efficient 
performance within remarkably modest di- 
mensions. 
The net result is a speaker system as attrac- 
tive to the eye as it is impressive to the ear. 
We invite you to form your own opinion of 
the Marquis 300 at your E -V high fidelity 
showroom soon. We're betting that you'll 
be glad to make room -just 21/2" more all 
around -for the new Marquis 300!

HOW TO as SURE OF 
GOOD TV SERVICE... 
Beware the Service "Bargain." If 
Iyou shop around for cut -rate prices or 
r extra -liberal service contracts, you're 
asking for trouble. A "something- for -nothing" 
offer usually means cut -rate parts and sub- 
standard service methods. The reputable service 
dealer spends years in study and training - 
thousands of dollars on test equipment, tools, 
and service manuals -countless hours in keep- 
ing up -to -date on new developments and serv- 
ice techniques. Because of this heavy investment, 
he can't afford to offer "bargains." 
Rely on a Fully Qualified Independ- 
ent Service Dealer. Well known 
and highly regarded by your friends 
and neighbors, his professional training and 
experience have made him a real technical 
expert. He takes pride in his work. He wants to 
stay in business. And he stakes his reputation 
and his future on satisfying you. So he'll use 
only component parts of the highest quality 
and latest design -plus his thorough knowledge 
and keen skills -to do the job right. Depend on 
him; he can't afford to let you down! 
Your TV set provides you with a wealth of entertainment. 
Keep it in the best repair ... at lowest cost ... by calling 
your local TV -RADIO Service Dealer at the first sign of trouble!

EXPANDING U.H.F. TV COVERAGE - 
ROLE OF TRANSLATORS 
When v.h.f. goes u.h.f., certain character- 
istic limitations in transmission coverage 
will show up. Techniques for overcoming 
these drawbacks, including the use of 
translators, have been developed from re- 
cent experience. This article includes 
ways of "filling in" areas where signal is 
poor in an attempt to duplicate the serv- 
ice presently provided on v.h.f. 
THE HALL EFFECT 
Although the principle has been known 
for decades, it is just moving out of the 
laboratory. John R. Collins points out 
how it is being applied in a good number 
of measuring devices and other instru- 
ments, including gaussmeters, genera- 
tors, ammeters, multipliers, and many 
others.

illl .. for the Record 
By W. A. STOCKLIN 
Editor 
EIA Defines "High Fidelity" 
ALTHOUGH not all of the facts have 
been made public as yet, we do know 
that the Electronic Industries Association 
has agreed on a definition of the term 
"high fidelity." Their recommendation will 
be presented shortly to the Federal Trade 
Commission in the hope that it will help 
them to determine what may or may not be 
advertised as a "high- fidelity" product. 
There is obviously a need for a realistic 
definition, but we suspect that the EIA 
recommendation will be identical to their 
previously published proposal. If this is 
so, it will be one of the biggest fiascos of 
1963. Imagine a definition that permits 
the term "high fidelity" to be applied to 
any product that (1) will produce 5 watts 
of music -power output and (2) has a fre- 
quency response within -3 db at 100 cps 
to -6 db at 8000 cps. No mention is made 
of many other important characteristics 
such as distortion, hum, power response, 
etc. Why? There are many table radio sets 
that could qualify as "high fidelity" under 
these standards. 
The EIA even apologizes in that they 
point out that their standards are inade- 
quate from an engineering and technical 
aspect and that only minimum standards 
were set. If they are not satisfied, why 
make such a recommendation? It is un- 
fortunate that those manufacturers who 
produce minimum -standard equipment 
will be given the same recognition as 
those producing truly high -quality de- 
signs. 
None of our readers will be misled but, 
unfortunately, the uninformed consumer 
will become even more confused about 
high fidelity than he already is. 
Why not call the low quality units sim- 
ply "radios and phonographs "? Then set 
realistic standards for high -quality de- 
signs. We might even set a number of dif- 
ferent standards to denote various levels 
of performance. 
We hope that the FTC gives consider- 
able thought to the recommended defini- 
tion before accepting it, since the stand- 
ard, as proposed, will not help them solve 
their problems regarding high -fidelity 
equipment. 
Is Pay -TV Here? 
BERNARD P. GALLAGHER, in one of 
his recent "Gallagher Reports " -a 
newsletter published in New York for ad- 
vertising, marketing, and media executives 
-has made some interesting comments 
which sort of lift one's eyebrows -"Pay -TV 
breakthrough is here -will be biggest in- 
dustry in communications field within ten 
years- Hartford first on- the -air test of 
Pay -TV." Interesting comments, but we 
wonder how any person can be so positive. 
Certainly the Hartford test wasn't the first, 
in that Zenith had a similar test in the 
Chicago area back in the late 1940's. Con- 
ditions haven't changed much over these 
years, with the exception that the eco- 
nomic status of the individual home owner 
has been raised, and people are more in- 
clined to spend money for entertainment 
today than they were twenty years ago. 
To be completely realistic, we do be- 
lieve that pay -TV will become a part of our 
everyday life in the years ahead. Our guess 
is that it will be at least twenty years be- 
fore an appreciable number of homes are 
covered and we doubt that it could ever 
surpass free TV, let alone become an in- 
dustry surpassing all other forms of com- 
munications. 
Technically there are no real problems. 
In fact even in the earlier tests there were 
no technical difficulties. There are various 
coding system methods, but this is rela- 
tively unimportant. There also will be vig- 
orous opposition, obviously, from corn - 
panies presently in free television and, of 
course, the movie houses. These, however, 
are simply desperation delaying tactics. 
As long as v.h.f. TV is the predominant 
form of transmission, pay -TV will be 
blocked. Congress, however, has helped by 
passing a law that all TV sets manufac- 
tured in 1964 and thereafter must include 
means for receiving u.h.f. TV stations in 
addition to those on v.h.f. It should then 
take five to eight years for present v.h.f: 
only models to become obsolete. Only then 
would the new all- channel sets become 
predominant. We have no doubt that tele- 
vision will eventually lose all v.h.f. chan- 
nels and will have to go all- u.h.f. but this 
will take at least ten years. Pay -TV should 
then make slow and gradual inroads from 
that time on. 
The most difficult problem is the avail- 
ability of first -rate program material that 
people will be willing to pay to watch. In 
all of 1962 Hollywood produced only 138 
films. Add to this the possible availability 
of legitimate stage shows, major sports 
events, operas, and symphony programs. 
To sum up, it would seem that there is a 
serious lack of top performing attractions. 
If pay -TV hopes to use second -rate attrac- 
tions, it will fail -the public will not pay 
for anything but the best. 
If pay -TV is to succeed, Hollywood 
would, for example, have to make available 
their entire inventory of new films. This is 
not as remote a possibility as it may seem, 
but it will take time. 
Yes, pay -TV will come, but it is not here 
today nor will it be the biggest industry in 
the communications field in ten years.

how will 
your success 
in electronics 
compare with 
this man's? 
Will you have a rewarding 
career, like Richard S. Conway? 
Or will you never get beyond 
a routine job? It's up to you. 
LET'S LOOK AT THE FACTS. There's something wonder- 
ful about understanding how a circuit works or what a 
filter capacitor does. If you've ever fixed a TV set, built 
a radio or used a voltmeter, you've tasted the thrills of 
electronics. 
This excitement may have led you to a job in electronics. 
But the glamour fades if you are stuck in the same job 
year after year. You'll be bored with routine and unhappy 
about prospects for future earnings. You'll discover, as 
have many men, that simply working in electronics 
does not assure a good future. 
If electronics is the "field of opportunity," how is this 
possible? No question about it, electronics offers many 
opportunities, but only to qualified men. In any career 
field, it is how much you know that counts. This is 
particularly true in the fast moving field of electronics. 
The man without thorough technical education doesn't 
advance. Even men with intensive military technical 
training find their careers can be limited in civilian 
electronics. 
ELECTRONICS KNOWLEDGE YOU CAN USE. CREI Home Study 
preparation gives R. S. Conway the technical background to deal with Engi- 
neers as Supervisor, Electronic Test Dept., Wilcox Electric Co. 
ADVANCED TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE IS THE KEY to success in 
electronics. If you have a practical knowledge of current engineer- 
ing developments, if you understand "why" as well as "how," 
you have what employers want and pay for. With such qualifica- 
tions, you can expect to move ahead. 
CREI OFFERS YOU, for study at home, a complete program in elec- 
tronic engineering technology designed to prepare you for a 
rewarding, well- paying career in electronics. CREI equips you 
with a practical working knowledge of advanced and up -to -date

I've been a regular reader for the 
many years I've been fixing TV sets for a 
living -but you can cancel my subscrip- 
tion right now. I used to consider your 
magazine as useful as my v.t.v.m. or 
other tools of the trade. If you want to 
know why I don't anymore, take a look 
at some titles in your December issue, 
for example: "Lasers and Their Uses," 
"Electronic Weighing," "Radiation Fin- 
gerprinting," and so on. Come on now! 
How can one of those help me with the 
unstable sync on that tough dog now 
tying up my bench? You are blundering 
off into outer space, getting away from 
the real needs of your readers. All the

To the Editors: 
I want you to know how much I en- 
joyed the December article on "Lasers

NON- DIRECTIONAL STEREO 
To the Editors: 
Mr. Hirsch's article on "Non- Direc- 
tional Stereo Effects" in the October 
issue performs a good service in directing 
attention to the fact that there is value 
to stereo reproduction, even through 
loudspeakers, entirely aside from the 
well -known directional, or "ping -pong 
ball," effect. 
The basis for Mr. Hirsch's thesis as to 
the independence of the two ears is pre- 
sumably the experience of observers lis- 
tening with one ear stopped up. Such 
listening must, of course, be done with 
loudspeakers rather than earphones to 
be of value. Beyond this, the validity of 
findings reported by persons having two 
good ears with one stopped up is open 
to question. The stopping up of one ear 
is a disturbing experience and would 
tend to interfere with subjective phe- 
nomena. Ideally tests should be per- 
formed with persons completely deaf on 
one side, who concededly could not give 
valid before -and -after testimony but 
could be examined as to what they ex- 
perience in the case of stereo. Such ex- 
periments would, it is believed, show 
that while the loss of one ear greatly in- 
terferes with the perception of sound 
sources and with directional effects of 
stereo, the non -directional effects are not 
entirely eliminated. I, personally, am 
now converting to stereo after having 
had one ear disconnected surgically, for 
different reasons of course.

ELECTRONIC DRAFTING MACHINE 
To the Editors: 
An interested group of draftsmen in 
this northern Michigan town would like 
further information concerning the elec- 
tronic drafting machine described on 
page 49 of your October issue. In par- 
ticular, does the man who makes the 
punched card need a drawing or graphic 
description of some kind before he can 
make the punched card? Call this ma- 
chine design or does the operator have 
to know what he wants it to reproduce? 
Basically the question is -can this ma- 
chine replace engineer and draftsman?

The machine cannot actually do design 
work and it must be programmed by 
someone who tells it what to do. As with 
all automation techniques, some of the 
more routine types of job classifications 
will be eliminated, but because of all the 
additional work that must be clone in

many of our industries, people in

ELECTROLYTIC CAPACITORS 
To the Editors: 
What happens to the capacitance of electrolytic capacitors 
when a.c. or very low voltage d.c. is applied? I have in mind 
the use of electrolytics in speaker crossover networks and in 
d.c. circuits where the voltage applied is much lower than the 
rated voltage value. 
Also along these lines, measurements of capacitance are 
frequently made in simple RC bridge circuits to which 60 cps 
a.c. is applied. Will the capacitance of electrolytics measured 
this way be the same as their capacitance in a d.c. circuit with 
the proper forming voltage applied to the capacitor? 
JAY HUNTER 
New Rochelle, N.Y. 
According to several capacitor manufacturers we contacted 
on these questions, it appears that once the electrolytic is 
properly formed by the manufacturer, it can be used on low - 
voltage audio or a.c. as well as on a low value of d.c. that is far 
below the rated working voltage. After a period of time, how- 
ever, the oxide dielectric film is reduced so that capacity is 
increased possibly by as much as 25% in a few months. This 
means that there will he a downward shift in crossover fre- 
quency if the electrolytics are used in speaker crossover net- 
works and possibly increased leakage in low d.c. circuits. 
When measuring electrolytics on a common RC bridge in 
which 60 or 120 cps a.c. is applied, the measurements should 
he quite accurate if the electrolytic is still properly formed. 
Therefore, it would be a good idea to check the capacitor for 
leakage first as this is done by the application of a d.c. voltage. 
This voltage insures that the dielectric is formed and that the 
leakage is brought down to its normal value. Once this is done, 
the capacitance can be measured with the a.c. from the bridge 
and the capacitance value thus measured will be as accurate 
as the bridge is able to read.- Editors. 
MULTIPLEX SIGNAL GENERATOR 
To the Editors: 
The circuit diagram for the FM multiplex signal generator 
that is shown on page :36 of your January, 1963 certainly looks 
very interesting. Evidently, a lot of care and thought went 
into the design and construction of the unit. However, I don't 
think that the meter circuit will operate unless a ground con- 
nection is added at the bottom ends of resistors R67 and R70. 
JOSEPH GARDENA 
San Diego, Calif. 
Thanks to Reader Gardena and others for pointing out the 
missing ground. In addition, the compactron tube V4 should 
he a 6K11 rather than a 6D11 designated on the parts list and 
schematic diagram. 
Finally, in order to have balanced outputs from phase 
splitter V3B, both plate -load and cathode -load resistors must 
be equal in value. Hence both R26 and R30 should-be 4700 - 
ohm, 1 -watt resistors. 
For readers who are having difficulty in obtaining single 
19- kilocycle crystals from the sources indicated in the article, 
we suggest that these readers contact the Audio Workshop,

Fisher KM -60 FM- Multiplex Tuner 
Audio Dynamics ADC -1 "Mark II" Phono Cartridge 
For copy of manufacturer's brochure, circle No. 58 on coupon (page 21). 
THE Audio Dynamics Corp. ADC -1 
was one of the first ultra- high -com- 
pliance stereo phono cartridges, de- 
signed to operate at tracking forces 
under one gram. The original ADC -1 
had a minimum compliance of 10 x 10 
cm. /dyne. Later this was increased to 
20 x 10-6 cm. /dyne. Now, with a further 
increase to 30 x 10 cm. /dyne, the car- 
tridge has received the "Mark II" des- 
ignation. 
The ADC -1 "Mark II" is a moving - 
magnet cartridge, with a replaceable 
stylus assembly. To reduce the stylus tip 
mass to a minimum (0.5 mg.) a tiny 
diamond cone with a 0.6 -mil radius is 
used. Stylus replacement requires no 
tools. 
The cartridge is encased in a Mumetal 
shield for hum reduction and is equipped 
with four output terminals. It is de- 
signed for termination in 47,000 ohms, 
and signal cable lengths should not ex-

teed five feet to avoid loss of high - 
frequency response. Its rated frequency 
response is ±2 db from 10 to 20,000 cps, 
with 30 -db rated channel separation 
from 50 to 7000 cps. The output is rela- 
tively high, 7 mv. at 5.5 cm. /sec. 
Before making measurements on the 
cartridge, we checked its ability to track 
high recorded velocities. It tracked the 
32 -cps band of the Cook 60 record at 1.5 
grams, and the 1000 cps, 30 cm. /sec. 
bands of the Fairchild 101 record at 2 
grams. Both records contain recorded 
velocities far greater than those usually 
encountered in musical recordings, most 
of which can be comfortably tracked at 
0.75 gram. This force was used for our 
frequency -response measurements. 
The CBS Labs STR -100 test record 
was used for frequency- response and 
channel- separation measurements. The 
response was ±2 db up to 14 kc., falling

above that frequency. Our connecting 
cables were at or a bit beyond the maxi- 
mum recommended length, and it is 
possible that shorter cables would slight- 
ly extend the high- frequency response. 
The channel separation was better than 
20 db up to about 5 kc., reducing to 
13 db at 10 kc., and exceeding 7 db all 
the way up to 20 kc. 
ADC uses the RCA 12 -5 -71 (78 rpm) 
record as the basis for their specifica- 
tions, so we checked the cartridge at sev- 
eral points with this record. The read- 
ings were similar to those obtained with 
the 33 -rpm CBS Labs record. 
The square -wave response, with the 
1 -kc. square waves of the STR -110 rec- 
ord, showed one cycle of ringing, at 30% 
of peak amplitude, which was quickly 
damped. The cartridge output was 7 
mv. per channel at 5 cm. /sec. lateral 
velocity. The two channel outputs were 
almost exactly equal at middle frequen- 
cies. The sensitivity to induced hum, 
although relatively high, was about 5 db 
lower than earlier ADC -1 cartridges we 
have tested. Since this cartridge is not 
likely to be used with inferior turntables 
having strong hum fields, this should 
present no problem. We have used the 
cartridge with several different turn- 
tables without experiencing any hum. 
Finally, we measured `thë intermodu- 
lation distortion of the cartridge as a 
function of peak recorded velocity, using 
the RCA 12 -5 -39 record. At 0.75 gram 
the IM was quite large, but at 2 grams 
it did not exceed the residual distortion 
of the record and test equipment up to 
about 18 cm. /sec. velocity. 
The listening characteristics of the 
cartridge are best described as clean, 
musical, slightly bright, and with excel- 
lent definition. Surface noise is very low 
and there is a slight sparkle which is 
noticeable by comparison to some other 
fine cartridges. Needle talk is very low. 
We have found that these cartridges will 
track very nicely at 0.75 gram in good 
arms, and forces larger than 1.5 grams 
should never be required. 
The price of the ADC -1 "Mark II" is 
$49.50.

FM- Multiplex Tuner 
For copy of manufa(lurcr's brochure, 
circle No. 59 on coupon (page 21) . 
THE KM -60 is an FM multiplex tuner, 
one of the "Stratakit" family of high - 
fidelity component kits by Fisher. These 
kits feature simple construction proce- 
dures, divided into a number of distinct 
stages 
( "strata ") . In the case of the 
KM -60, there are 16 stages, each hav- 
ing all its parts (including pre -cut wire) 
in a plastic packet. The spiral -bound 
construction manual displays the steps 
for only one stage at a time, together 
with a life -size (or larger) pictorial lay- 
out of that part of the assembly. 
The marreal is written in a conver- 
sational style, which makes for enjoy- 
able reading, and explains the signifi- 
cance of each stage in the final opera- 
tion of the tuner. The critical circuits,

such 
as the front end and multiplex 
demodulator, are pre -wired and aligned. 
The i.f. transformers are roughly 
aligned; final adjustment is clone with a 
received signal, using the unit's tuning 
meter. This process is further simplified 
by a switch on the chassis which con- 
nects the meter to the limiter grid for 
i.f. alignment (and normal operation) 
or to the detector Output for detector 
alignment. 
Physically, the tuner looks much like 
Fisher factory -wired tuners, with a rigid, 
brushed brass finished panel. On the 
panel are switches for controlling power, 
mono /stereo reception, and a stereo 
noise filter, as well as the tuning knob. 
On the rear of the chassis are two pairs 
of output jacks, for driving a tape re- 
corder as well as the main amplifier, and 
individual channel level controls. 
The unit has a 6DJ8 cascode r.f. am- 
plifier, a 6AQ8 mixer /oscillator, two 
6AU6 i.f. amplifiers, and two more 6AU6 
i.f. stages which also act as limiters. Two 
germanium diodes are used in the wide - 
band ratio detector. The multiplex chas- 
sis uses switching circuits similar to 
those in the company's multiplex adap- 
ters. A 12AT7 amplifies the composite 
signal which (after filtering to remove 
SCA modulation) goes to two four -diode 
switches. The 19 -kc. pilot carrier syn- 
chronizes a 12AX7 push -pull oscillator 
at 38 kc., which alternately gates on the 
two switches. Their outputs are left- and

19 -kc. pilot carrier is rectified, and the

an EM184A eye tube ( "Stereo Beam "), 
signalling the fact that the station is

comPUTERS 
Will future computers be able to learn, reason, and 
think for themselves? By studying the human brain 
and nervous system and by imitating their operation, 
we are beginning to make some headway to that goal. 
By KEN GILMORE 
IN a laboratory at Wright -Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton, Ohio, scientists 
are spending their time these days watching a mouse. The mouse -an electronic 
one -is learning to run a maze. 
The mouse is of tremendous interest to the Air Force because its "brain" -the com- 
puter which directs its activities -is a completely new kind of device. This different 
thinking machine may be the forerunner of a whole new generation of advanced com- 
puters. And although opinion among experts in the field is by no means unanimous, 
some workers foresee the day when these unique machines may outdistance today's 
most advanced computers as easily as present computers overshadow the abacus. 
Guiding the mouse through the maze is a bionic computer -a machine whose circuitry 
is based not on conventional computer elements, such as flip -flops and ferrite memory 
cores, but on principles which bionic scientists have learned from studying living brains 
and the way they work. 
The Model: the Brain Cell 
The basic element of the bionic computer is the artificial neuron -an electronic imita- 
tion of a nerve cell. Scientists have long known that living brains are composed of 
neurons: cells which are similar in some ways to computer elements. 
The biological neuron (shown in simplified form in Fig. 1) is a threshold device. It 
has many inputs -usually a few hundred but sometimes as many as several thousand - 
called dendrites (D), and one output, an axion (A). The processing of electrical signals 
takes place in the central cell body (B) . Most of the dendrites are excitory, that is, 
signals coming in over them tend to cause the cell to "fire." But some are inhibitory: 
signals appearing on these dendrites tend to keep the cell from firing. A neuron's status - 
firing or non- firing -at any particular moment is determined by the combination of signals 
appearing on the dendrites. If enough excitory signals appear, the cell threshold is ex- 
ceeded and the neuron fires. Of course, if inhibitory impulses are present, it takes 
more excitory signals to exceed the threshold. 
The biological neuron is essentially a digital device. Its output is "all -or- none." When 
its threshold is exceeded, it generates a constant -amplitude .5- millisecond pulse (Fig. 
2) . The normal resting potential is around -70 millivolts, and the peak potential is 
about +50 millivolts; hence, the pulse itself has a peak amplitude of about 120 millivolts. 
After firing, the neuron recovers fòr a millisecond or so -then if the signal is still present, 
25 

or else if another input signal comes along, it fires again. 
Neural Networks 
The complexity of the human brain is almost incompre- 
hensible. It contains on the order of ten billion neurons, each 
with hundreds or thousands of dendrites. The neurons are 
connected in semi -random patterns, with each one receiving 
signals from and sending signals to hundreds or thousands 
of others. Signals from eyes, ears, and scores of other sensors 
all over the body are fed into this complex network, where 
they set billions of patterns of currents swirling through tril- 
lions of interconnections. 
Somehow, this fantastic data -handling system, which 
dwarfs to insignificance our most advanced electronic com- 
puters, generates all human and animal actions and reactions. 
Also produced in ways only dimly understood are qualities 
we have come to know as intelligence, learning ability, and 
emotion. 
The electrical neural activity also accounts for memory, 
although there is some doubt as to how. Some physiologists 
and bionicists feel that a certain pathway set up for proc- 
essing a certain signal tends to "wire" the neurons so that 
they are more likely to conduct a similar signal along the 
same pathway the next time. If you solve a problem, for 
example, the neural currents tend to `bias" the neurons in- 
volved in a certain pattern. The next time you face the same 
problem, the biased neurons would tend to conduct currents 
along the same pathways, or to put it another way, to "re- 
member" the previous solution and repeat it. Continued 
exposure tends to reinforce the "biasing" or "wiring" and 
thus makes the memory firmer. 
Imitating the Neuron 
Although our understanding of the operation of complex 
biological neuron nets is extremely limited, the operation 
of single neurons is fairly well understood. Consequently, 
scientists have been able to construct artificial neurons- 
electronic circuits that duplicate closely the electrical activity 
of the biological neuron. 
At least twenty companies are working on such a project, 
and have come up with many different kinds of circuits. Fig. 
3 shows one such neuron designed at Bell Laboratories. It 
has six inputs -five excitory and one inhibitory. Its opera- 
tional characteristics closely approximate those of the bio- 
logical neuron, except that its input and output signals are 
on the order of one volt, rather than in the millivolt range 
as is the case with the biological model. 
The Aeronutronic Division of Ford Motor Company has 
built an artificial neuron called "MIND" (Magnetic Inte- 
grator Neuron Duplicator), which is simpler but does not 
imitate the behavior of the neuron as closely as the Bell 
model. General Electric, Melpar, and many other companies 
(Al Model of pattern -recognition system, 
based on array of neuron -like elements. 
Toggle 
switches for input sources and 
lights that display whether the sources are 
energized are in the two rectangular arrays 
on the front of the model. Neuron -like 
translation modules are also employed in 
similar array on right side of the unit. 
(B) Network of electronic neurons is assem- 
bled by L. D. Harmon of Bell Telephone Lab- 
oratories, who initiated project of simu- 
lating the functions of nerve cells with 
simple transistorized circuit. Array shown 
imitates some functions of the eye nerves. 
IC) The Air Force's "bionic mouse" learns 
to run maze in much the same way as does 
its live counterpart. Scientists hope that 
some day vastly more complex 
bionic 
brains may rival the human brain in its 
ability to think, to reason, and to learn. 
ELECTRONICS WORLD 

have also built artificial neurons of one type or another. 
The Melpar model- called "Artron" by its inventors -is the 
neuron used in the Air Force's maze -running mouse. The 
mouse's "brain" contains just 10 "Artrons " -as compared with 
10- billion neurons in a human brain -but these give it enough 
learning ability to master the maze. 
When the mouse begins its learning task, it has an almost 
limitless combination of choices as to which legs of the 
maze it will follow. At first, its course is completely trial 
and error. But each time the mouse makes a turn which 
works out properly, the cells are biased to operate that way 
again -in other words, they "remember" the proper turns. 
The author saw the mouse put through its paces in Dayton 
recently. First, all circuits were returned to electrical neutral- 
ity-the mouse's memory was wiped clean. The first trip, it 
made scores of wrong turns and took about 45 minutes to 
find its way through the maze. The next trip out the time was 
cut in half. On the eighth trip, it ran through from beginning 
to end in 35 seconds flat, without a single error. 
Self-organizing Systems 
Scientists working with bionic computers are hopeful that 
these strange thinking machines may help break the program- 
ming bottleneck. Each step a present -day computer is to 
take must be outlined in detail before the machine can 
function. It frequently takes months of human time to pro- 
a left. The mouse, equipped with red and green sensors, 
won't be instructed- programmed, in computer language -to 
pay attention to the lights. But, like a live mouse, it will 
see them. If predictions hold, the mouse without being told 
will figure out for itself that red means left and green right. 
Then, when placed in a new maze equipped with lights, it 
should run it properly the first time. 
Bright Bionic Future 
A bionic brain might eventually begin to perform feats 
now completely out of the question for non -living systems, 
indeed, might display true intelligence. Pattern recognition, 
for example, is a field now in its infancy. A few machines

or letters if they're written clearly enough. But human beings 
recognize with ease patterns of astonishing complexity. A 
child who can't add 2 -t- 2, for example, can recognize hun- 
dreds of different people at a glance, by differentiating be- 
tween the subtle changes in the patterns of their faces. 
Elementary self -organizing pattern recognizing systems 
called "Perceptrons" have already been built at Cornell and 
other places. So far, they work, but do well to recognize 
simple letters. But what scientists learn from these early 
machines may help them build more versatile devices in the 
future.

Man, animals -and now bionic computers, such as the one 
which guides the mouse -on the other hand, fall into a cat- 
egory labeled "self- organizing data -processing systems." One 
man can tell another to make out a payroll, and no further 
instructions are necessary. Man, in other words, is self -pro- 
gramming. He operates on general instructions, filling in de- 
tails for himself. But a computer has to be instructed on 
each minute step: read certain names and amounts from the 
memory, compute certain figures, etc. 
Bionic computers are, to some extent, already self- program- 
ming. The mouse doesn't have to be programmed to run the 
maze -it figures out the process for itself. Furthermore, if 
the maze is changed, it sets to work and learns the new 
maze -again without being told. 
A new mouse -one with 40 neurons -is now being built and 
should be capable of even more complex behavior. In one 
experiment, Air Force scientists plan to put red and green 
lights on either side of the passageway. A green light will

spot important patterns and notify the ground station, ignore 
everything else. A spy -in- the -sky could look out for missile 
launchings, also for troop movements, armament buildups, 
or other tell -tale signs. It could look at microphotographs 
of blood samples and tissue sections and make diagnostic 
decisions. (MIT already has a working model of one such 
device which can recognize a certain type of cancer cell 
by looking at it through a microscope. ) 
Bionic brains, of course, wouldn't have abilities such as 
these the moment they rolled off the assembly line. Unlike 
ordinary computers which are ready to work as soon as the 
last soldered connection cools, bionic computers would have 
to learn their jobs. One Air Force scientist estimates that 
a newly completed brain might sit on the shelf for a year 
or more, soaking up information poured into it 24 hours 
a day. Its "education" received in this way would be com- 
parable in some respects to the education of a human being. 
Learning ability isn't the only benefit we may get from 
designing bionic computers to imitate living brains. Another 
is reliability. You were born with some 10 billion neurons-

all you will ever have. When a neuron dies, it is not replaced. 
And about 1000 die every hour of your life. You'll lose 500 
million during a normal lifetime, yet you will still operate 
effectively. As a matter of fact, there is apparently no ad- 
verse effect on the system due to the death of individual 
neurons, within certain limits. 
Bionic scientists call this the principle of reliable oper- 
ation with unreliable parts. Because of the vast number of 
neurons and their system of random interconnections, when 
one dies others around it take over its tasks. Designers 
expect that bionic computers will similarly continue to work 
reliably even if part is damaged or destroyed. In a satel- 
lite, where repair is impossible, bionic devices would con- 
tinue to operate as part after part failed. Life expectancy 
of such devices -even without service -might be measured 
in terms of decades, rather than weeks or months as it is

Human Beings- Living Computers 
The idea which eventually resulted in bionic computers 
came from the brilliant mathematician, Norbert Weiner, in 
the late 1940's. His classic book "Cybernetics," published 
in 1948, pointed out for the first time that man could be 
considered not only as an animal with certain behavioral 
patterns, but as a fantastically complex information proces- 
sor-a flesh and blood digital computer. But far too little 
was understood about the human mechanism to hope to 
apply its principles to electronic circuitry at that time. 
Richard Caton had discovered in 1875 that the brain was 
essentially an electrical device, but that didn't help much 
either. Trying to explore the brain's operation by reading 
electroencephalograms is like figuring out how an IBM 7090 
works by measuring voltages on the outside of the cabinet. 
The breakthrough in the study of the brain's operation 
came in 1949 when Ling and Gerard invented the intracellu- 
lar electrode, a glass capillary tube with a conducting salt 
inside. Its over -all outside diameter was on the order of a 
few tenths of a micron ( more than 10,000 such probes laid 
side by side wouldn't cover an inch) . With the microprobe, 
it became possible for the first time to measure electrical 
currents in individual neurons. 
In the early 1950's, the need for computer systems orders 
of magnitude better than those then in existence became ob- 
vious. So scientists, while continuing to improve conven- 
tional computers as rapidly as possible, also began to look 
around for new approaches to data processing. They found 
one clue in the oldest data handling system in existence: 
the brain. Scientists around the country set to work to 
wrest useful secrets locked in the brain cells of animals 
and men.

TURNTABLE 
TESTING at HOME 
By EDGAR VILLCHUR 
President, Acoustic Research, Inc. 
The most important characteristics can be checked by 
simple tests and techniques with results that are just 
as valid, and sometimes more valid, than lab measurements. 
APREVIOUS article by this writer 
( "Loudspeaker 
Testing and Measurement," October 1961 issue of 
ELECTRONICS WORLD) stressed the professional re- 
quirements of equipment and techniques suitable for testing 
speakers. It was pointed out, for example, that attempts at 
making rough frequency- response measurements at home 
generally produce results that are meaningless or even mis- 
leading. 
Two years of work in developing and testing the AR turn- 
table have led me to the conclusion that there is very nearly 
a reverse situation with regard to testing turntables and arms. 
Only one commercial test instrument has yielded measure- 
ments of flutter' and rumble that correlate well with listening 
results -a behemoth made by Dataservice Corp. that weighs 
its measurements according to perceptibility. Flutter and 
rumble measurements with standard unweighted instruments 
have proven to be less valid in predicting performance than 
controlled, comparison listening tests, using methods and test 
records to be described here. Other turntable characteristics, 
IThe American Standards Association defines "flutter" as any deviation in the 
frequency of reproduced sound; "wow" is described 
as 
a colloquial term 
commonly applied to flutter at relatively slow rates. 
March, 1963 
such as speed accuracy and drift, can be measured at home 
as reliably as they can in the laboratory. 
This article will describe methods of testing record players 
for the following characteristics: (1) speed accuracy, (2) 
speed drift (with time, line voltage, or change of mechanical 
load), (3) rumble, (4) flutter /wow, (5) vertical warp wow, 
(6) susceptibility to acoustic feedback and to floor shocks, 
(7) arm inertia and pivot friction, and (8) tracking error. 
Some of these tests, and particularly the one relating to flutter, 
take on meaning only in comparing two or more turntables. 
Others have validity by themselves, and the results can be 
compared to established Standards. 
Speed Accuracy 
Stroboscope cards are very common, but their proper use, 
and desirable standards of speed accuracy, are not as well 
known. It is not enough to glance at an illuminated strobo- 
scope card and determine whether the bars or dots appear to 
be stationary or in motion. If the turntable is so far off speed 
that a casual glance reveals the card lines to be in motion, 
the speed is beyond acceptable professional limits of accu- 
racy. 
29 

NAB Standards for the speed accuracy of turntables used 
in broadcast work is =0.3 %, which is to say a drift of strobe 
lines on a standard card of 21 per minute maximum. Once this 
high standard is achieved there is no need to improve accu- 
racy further. 
The drift of strobe lines must be counted while holding a 
pencil or other marker near them, viewing the card under 
an a.c. light, preferably fluorescent. A watch with a second 
hand and an assistant are needed. The count should be macle 
while the pickup is playing at normal stylus force at the 
outer grooves of the record, and it should be repeated at the 
inner grooves. 
Speed Drift 
Turntables may change speed after starting because the 
electrical resistance of the motor windings tends to increase 
with heat. This speed change does not take place at all in 
synchronous units, and modern induction motors can be de- 
signed to resist such drift. A strobe card check on starting, 
and again after a quarter of an hour of running, will show 
any speed change. 
A more important source of speed drift is variation in line 
voltage. Many turntables with synchronous motors remain on 
speed in the face of tremendous line -voltage drops, some- 
times to a value as low as 20 volts. A reasonable requirement 
for non -synchronous turntables is that their speed remain 
within the NAB ±0.3% accuracy when the line voltage is re- 
duced from 117 v. to 100 v. or increased to 130 v. The test 
consists of varying input voltage to the turntable over these 
limits with a variable autotransformer ( the arm playing in 
the outside grooves) and seeing whether the lines on the 
strobe card drift more than 21 per min. in either direction. 
If they do, and the user is in an area with large line -voltage 
the speed of the turntable is accurately clocked once again. 
There are no commercial home turntables that will not 
slow down enough on this test so that the change is readily 
measurable. Just how much increase of mechanical load 
should be tolerated before the 0.3% slow -down occurs has not 
been established as an industry standard. The writer believes 
that a turntable should be able to tolerate an extra five grams 
load on the pickup without slowing more than 0.3% or 21 
lines /min. on the strobe disc. 
This may not seem too difficult a trial, but probably one - 
third of current commercial units, both "heavy" and "light," 
would not pass the test. Some turntables appear to have high 
torque when the platter is stopped by hand, but this test is no 
index of useful torque, that is, the torque which keeps the 
platter from slowing down more than 0.3% in the face of 
increased mechanical load. A turntable may drop 0.7% in 
speed with only a few extra grams on the pickup, yet continue 
to revolve, at an unusably slow speed, under very great me- 
chanical loads. The ability of the turntable to resist stopping 
by hand does reflect total torque, but not necessarily that 
part of the torque applicable to playing records. 
Fig. 1 shows the speed -drift test made at a production line 
test station, with a nickel placed on the pickup. 
Rumble 
The NAB Rumble Standard for turntables used in broad- 
cast work is explicit: the maximum instantaneous level of 
rumble is to be at least 35 db below a test signal of 1.4 cm./ 
sec. at 100 cps. The ballistic characteristics of the meter must 
be the same as a vu meter, and the amplifier used in the test 
must have standard playback equalization. 
This Standard is a very exacting one, particularly if it is 
applied to both vertical and lateral rumble, and many current

Fig. 2. The amount of warp wow is determined by arm length L 
variations, a voltage regulator between the turntable and 
wall outlet will solve the problem. Where such line -voltage 
variations are expected, however, selection of a synchronous - 
motor turntable to begin with is generally more economical. 
The greatest weakness of turntables with regard to speed 
drift is susceptibility to changes of mechanical load asso- 
ciated with operating conditions. This type of speed variation 
takes place in both synchronous and non- synchronous units, 
because it results from slip in the drive system as well as in 
the motor. A simple method of varying the load on a turntable 
in a controlled manner is to add weight to the pickup -a U.S. 
penny for three grams, a nickel for five grams. 
The difference in mechanical load imposed on the turn- 
table between record drag on the outside grooves and drag 
on the inside grooves is typically equivalent to about two 
grams added weight on the pickup. A heavily recorded pas- 
sage may increase the mechanical load by an amount equal 
to an extra gram or two. Dust cleaners that bear on the ro- 
tating record may increase the load by as much as an added 
six grams. 
Turntable speed is first measured and recorded with the 
pickup playing a record's outside grooves at normal stylus 
force. This test should be repeated at least once to establish 
an accurate base for comparison. A nickel is then placed on 
the pickup ( after it is put back to the outside grooves) and 
30 
and the. height H of the pivot above the sur ace of the record. 
turntables do not meet it. However, rumble measurement 
methods can be changed to "improve" the readings. The use 
of a meter movement more highly damped than a vu meter, 
and the employment of a playback preamplifier without bass 
equalization (a procedure in use by one testing organization) 
serves to reduce measured rumble level as much as 25 db. 
Even with strict adherence to the NAB measuring tech- 
nique, however, the NAB rumble reading is not an adequate 
index of turntable excellence with respect to rumble. The 
NAB Standard itself specifically points out that its described 
testing technique yields a measured electrical level, not the 
aural annoyance value of the rumble. 
Rumble may be predominantly subsonic in frequency, or it 
may have strong components in the 30 -cps, 60 -cps, and 120 - 
cps region. Hearing sensitivity at the higher rumble frequen- 
cies is much greater, and the difference between hearing sensi- 
tivity to subsonic rumble and that to rumble in the 30- or 60- 
cps region is often much more significant than the difference 
between two turntables in absolute rumble level.2 Thus we 
may have two record players with the same unweighted 
rumble level, one very quiet in performance and the other 
exhibiting objectionable rumble. 
2Although subsonic rumble can load the amplifier the level would have to be 
very high to be significant, and this consideration is not ordinarily involved 
in modern turntables. 
ELECTRONICS WORLD 

It was discovered early in the AR development project 
that our very accurate rumble- measurement equipment, built 
exactly to NAB specifications, did not provide as valid infor- 
mation in assigning relative ratings to two or more turntables 
as a simple listening test. We now use, in addition to the NAB 
specified equipment, the Dataservice meter referred to earlier 
for production testing, which gives frequency -weighted read- 
ings that correlate very well with listening results. When the 
production -line tester takes rumble readings, he also listens to 
the rumble ( in stereo ) at a set sound level, as an added check. 
A further advantage of listening tests is that lateral and 
vertical rumble are introduced in the same manner as they are 
under stereo operating conditions. Vertical rumble is normally 
the more significant component in stereo playback. 
The suggested rumble listening test consists of setting up 
two or more turntable -arm assemblies and playing an un- 
modulated groove on each with the same cartridge, in stereo. 
( Some available rumble and flutter test records appear in 
Table 1.) The preamplifier should be set for normal stereo 
operation, the treble controls should be all the way down, and 
the volume and bass controls should be set high enough so 
that the rumble is readily audible but not so high that acoustic 
feedback is introduced. The controls, of course, must not be 
changed when one turntable is disconnected from the pre- 
amplifier and the next one plugged in. 
The loudspeakers used must have reasonable response in 
the octave below 60 cps. The listener (or listening jury) 
should walk around the room to avoid dead spots at particu- 
lar bass frequencies, but should make sure the comparisons 
between turntables are made from the same room position. 
It is the writer's experience that differences in rumble be- 
tween one turntable and another on the above test are usually 
obvious, and sometimes easier to establish than differences in 
unsteady vu meter readings. The higher the volume at which 
the test can be conducted the more readily the differences 
can be spotted, but an insufficiently compliant mounting of 
a record player introduces acoustic feedback when the volume 
control is advanced too far, masking the rumble component 
being examined. 
One absolute rather than relative listening test that has 
validity can be made. This consists of determining the maxi- 
mum position of the bass and volume controls that will be 
used for a particular installation, and listening to the quiet 
groove record with the controls in that position. The rumble 
should be almost or entirely absent at all listening positions 
in the room. 
Flutter 
As in the case of rumble, raw measurements of flutter (by 
which is meant the per -cent signal frequency deviation 
caused by instantaneous variations of turntable speed) are 
not sufficient to predict turntable performance on music. This 
is because the perceptibility of flutter varies by a factor of 
more than 3 to 1 with the flutter rate. 
Speed variations at the rate of 3 per second are most notice- 
able in reproduced music. Flutter at ',3 cycle per second - 
corresponding to one cycle per revolution at 333 rpm -is less 
than half as noticeable, and flutter at much higher frequencies 
is only ',3 to 34 as noticeable. These relationships have been 
studied and validated, and are recognized by the ASA -IRE 
Standard "American Standard Method for Determining 
Flutter Content of Sound Recorders and Reproducers." This 
Standard proposes the use of a "flutter index" that is weighted 
according to perceptibility as determined by flutter rate. 
Two turntables with the same per -cent flutter would exhibit 
sharply contrasting performance in the steadiness of musical 
tones if one turntable had flutter whose predominant rate 
was 3 cps, while the other had flutter rates at l and 15 cps. 
A listening test on the standard flutter test band -a steady 
3000 -cps pure tone -would provide a better index of the 
relative quality of these two turntables than would measure-

meats that have been made with an unweighted flutter meter. 
No turntable or even professional tape machine will repro- 
duce the 3000 -cps steady tone so well in a normally reverber- 
ant room that some flutter variations are not apparent. The 
relative amount and rate of variation in different units, how- 
ever, is not too difficult to perceive, and flutter listening tests 
can be used to establish relative ratings of different turntables. 
The listener rates each turntable on how steady the test tone 
sounds. Such a test cannot be used on a single turntable with- 
out reference to another, except after long experience. 
The listener will probably be surprised, on first hearing 
a 3000 -cps test tone played, at how much audible flutter is 
produced by even a high -quality turntable. This does not 
mean that turntables are not good enough, but that the test 
conditions for flutter measurement have been purposely 
chosen to exaggerate the effect. A small amount of detectable 
flutter in the standard 3000 -cps test tone means undetectable 
flutter on music. 
In listening to the flutter test record the volume should be 
set moderately high, and kept the same for all turntables. 
Treble controls should be at normal. It is a good idea to turn 
bass controls all the way down, to isolate any effects of 
rumble. Make sure that the turntable has come up to speed, 
and listen to each unit for at least 15 seconds. You may move 
around the room to find the position in which flutter is most 
noticeable, but this is less important than it is in the case of 
rumble testing. 
Results of the above flutter tests can be checked against 
results with a piano record that has sustained tones. Flutter 
gives them a wavering, unsteady quality. 
Vertical Warp Wow 
Vertical warp wow is a term used to describe flutter caused 
by vertical motion of the tonearm due to record warp. When 
the needle follows warp in a record it not only swings vertical- 
ly but must also move back and forth horizontally in the 
groove, since different points on its arc do not lie above the 
same point on the record. This creates a relative velocity be- 
tween the needle and the record groove which is either added 
to or subtracted from the needle- groove velocity associated 
with rotation of the turntable. Groove speed variation, or 
flutter, is therefore introduced. It sounds exactly like any 
other flutter. 
The amount of warp wow is precisely determined by two 
elements -the length of the arm (needle to vertical pivots) 
and the height of this pivot above the record surface. The 
longer the arm, and the lower the pivot above the record,

The test for warp wow consists of a repetition of the flutter 
listening test, but with an 33" wedge placed under the record 
rim at one point. Listen for wavering of pitch at a one -per- 
revolution rate. 
Acoustic Feedback 
If you have tested a group of turntable -arm assemblies for 
rumble as described above, you have probably already en- 
countered acoustic feedback. Acoustic feedback between 
speakers and record player sets an upper limit to the level 
at which the rumble test can be conducted; a low- frequency 
howl builds up, even on a quiet groove, when the volume 
and /or bass controls are turned up too high. Less obvious 
symptoms of acoustic feedback, occurring at lower volume 
levels and noticeable on music, are a tendency to boominess 
that does not seem to be caused by any one of the reproducing 
components, and an apparent increase of rumble. 
The relative degree of freedom from acoustic feedback of 
different record players can be determined by noting how 
far the volume and bass controls can be advanced while the 
quiet grooves are being played, or with the pickup simply 
resting on a record with the motor off, before feedback sets in. 
The feedback should be egged on a bit by tapping the table 
surface on which the record player rests, or stamping lightly 
on the floor. A practical non- comparative test for an indi- 
vidual unit consists of turning the volume and bass controls 
to the maximum position at which they will be used in that 
particular installation, and then observing whether tapping 
or stamping sets up a train of low- frequency oscillations with 
the needle on the record. If oscillations are set up, improved 
shock -mounting is called for. 
3The vertical pivot refers to the pivot controlling vertical motion of the arm. 
Its physical disposition is normally horizontal. 
32 
Insensitivity to mechanical shock is related to the same de- 
sign elements that provide freedom from acoustic feedback. 
With proper shock -mounting of the turntable, heavy jumping 
or dancing nearby should not interfere with record perform- 
ance. 
Arm Inertia and Pivot Friction 
On a perfectly flat, perfectly centered record the only mo- 
tion of the arm is the slow sweep towards the center. Arm 
inertia and pivot friction do not need to be especially low to 
accommodate this motion. 
Unfortunately even the best records are both slightly 
warped and slightly off center. The arm must oscillate both 
vertically and horizontally to keep the needle in the groove, 
and if the needle is to keep in proper groove contact, inertia 
and friction must be at a minimum. 
Arm inertia is a function of the total effective mass of the 
arm referred to the needle tip, and must not be confused 
with stylus force. The counterweight, as a matter of fact, 
adds to rather than subtracts from the total inertia, at the 
same time that it counterbalances the effect of gravity. The 
desirability of keeping arm mass as low as possible is the 
reason that cartridge shells are often made of plastic or, if 
of metal, have cut -away sides. 
A simple but effective test for arm inertia and horizontal 
bearing friction, first described by C. G. McProud, can be 
performed with a standard 45 -rpm record. The record is 
placed eccentrically on the table, with the spindle against 
one edge of the large hole as in Fig. 3. The test is to see how 
much the stylus force can be reduced before the needle 
leaves the groove on its horizontal swings. 
The lowest stylus force at which the arm will play the 
record without leaving the groove- ignoring the severe wow 
caused by the variation in groove speed -is an index of both 
arm inertia and horizontal pivot friction. It is easy to compare 
record players on this test (the same cartridge must be used 
in each case); establishing a standard which reflects the prac- 
tical requirements of a high quality arm is not so easy. The 
writer feels that a very good arm should not be thrown from 
the groove in this test at the lowest force at which the arm 
is intended to work, with the record turning at 3333 rpm. Tor- 
turing the record player in this way is not an empty stunt, 
but a technique of simulating operating conditions in which 
high inertia and /or friction can give trouble. While the 
record eccentricity involved in the test is a gross exaggeration 
of any eccentricity ever actually encountered, the arm veloc- 
ities induced may be equaled under operating conditions, for 
example by a very sharp warp. 
Tracking Error 
Tracking error is sometimes specified as the maximum 
number of degrees that the cartridge is off -tangent to the 
groove at any point on the record. This is not a very mean- 
ingful specification. Two record players which have the same 
maximum tracking error may differ in tracking -error distortion 
by more than two to one. 
The proper way to specify tracking error is in terms of 
tracking -error index, whose dimensions are in degrees /inch 
radius. For example, a 9 -in. arm with the correct offset angle, 
installed with the correct overhang, will have a tracking -error 
index of approximately 0.32 ° /in. This means that the maxi- 
mum tracking error that will occur at any groove radius is 0.32 
degree times that radius. At any given radius, of course, the 
error may be much less, and it will be zero at two points. 
Tracking error will usually be maximum at the outside groove 
-about 1.8 °. 
The reason that this type of index was established is that 
a given amount of tracking error, creating distortion of x per- 
cent at the outside record groove radius of 5.5 in., will create 
distortion of 2x per -cent at an inner groove radius of 2.75 in.

(class D, 27 Inc., and class A, 460 -470 Inc.) much that is said here 
is equally applicable to antenna systems using CB frequencies. 
THE OLD adage that a chain is only as strong as its 
weakest link has probably been applied to every type 
of electronic system from high -fidelity to space telem- 
etry. That the antenna is a vital link in the chain of radio 
communications is a foregone conclusion; without the an- 
tenna, the message would be "stuck" at the plate of the final 
power amplifier. The purpose of this article is not to justify 
the importance of any antenna, but to point out some of the 
ways in which the antenna can be used to increase the ef- 
fectiveness and efficiency of communications. 
Although we are primarily interested in antennas for 
Business Radio, the discussion is general enough to apply to 
most antenna systems. Since the majority of business radio 
communications 
is concerned with base -station -to- mobile 
and mobile -to- mobile service, we will concentrate on these 
systems. 
Antenna Types 
The basic element in virtually all communications antennas 
is the vertical quarter -wave "whip" radiator. At 30 mc., a 
quarter -wave whip is approximately 8 feet long; at 150 mc., 
18 inches; and at 450 mc., 6 inches. It becomes apparent 
that antenna arrays using multiple elements are more easily 
constructed at the higher frequencies since the size and 
mechanical strength limitations are more easily overcome. 
The simplest antenna is merely a vertical length of wire, 
one -quarter wavelength long, connected to the inner con- 
ductor of the coaxial transmission line. The outer conductor 
of the line is grounded. A typical example is the automobile 
rooftop antenna. For that matter, most mobile antennas are 
quarter -wave whips. The basic radiation or reception pattern 
resembles a doughnut with the whip projecting through the 
hole in the doughnut. This type of antenna transmits or 
receives maximum energy horizontally; there is relatively 
little vertical response. However, to achieve this pattern, the 
antenna must be working against a good ground plane. In 
mobile installations, the ground plane is provided by the 
metal body of the car. For tower -mounted base- station an- 
tennas, some means must be employed to achieve an artificial 
ground plane and isolate the antenna from the effects of the 
metal tower and transmission line. The tower or line will be 
in the same direction as the polarization of the radiated or 
received energy and may act as a parasitic antenna element. 
One method of isolating the antenna from the line and 
tower is by the use of ground -plane rods. At the base of the 
quarter -wave radiating element, four quarter -wave rods pro- 
ject at an angle slightly below horizontal. The particular 
angle is selected to maintain a proper impedance match. 
Fig. 
1. From the basic "doughnut" pattern of the simplest omnidirectional vertical antenna 
is derived the more useful pattern 
shown. This pattern results in improved coverage all around the antenna by concentrating the radiated energy vertically and keep- 
ing most of it close to the ground. Such directivity is usually achieved by vertical stacking of a number of omnidirectional elements.

Additional isolation is sometimes provided by four other hori- 
zontal rods that are mounted somewhat lower on the mast. 
The quarter -wave "hairpin" folded dipole type of antenna 
is another variation of the ground -plane approach. The folded 
dipole is the radiator, one end of which is grounded. The 
grounded radiator provides a direct ground for static electrical 
charges which could add to receiver noise level, and it also 
provides a degree of lightning protection without the use of 
arresters or gaps. The use of a folded element also provides 
an increase in antenna impedance, which makes for improved 
transmission -line matching especially when parasitic elements 
are used. 
From the horizontal dipole antenna, commonly used with 
TV receivers, the coaxial dipole antenna is easily evolved. The 
radiator is rotated to a vertical position, the lower element 
is enlarged into a tube, and the feedline is run through the 
tube to the junction of the two elements. (See Fig. 2.) The 
result is similar to the use of a ground plane. 
Other types of antennas, or a number of the more common 
types stacked together, are used to produce different radia- 
tion patterns, thus covering the desired geographical area 
with the most efficient radio signal. The basic pattern, as 
we have seen, is omnidirectional, ideally providing virtually 
equal coverage 360° around the antenna. Many basic hori-

set of ground rods to provide a better artificial ground 
plane and isolate the antenna. The upper ground -plane 
rods are tilted downward for better impedance match 
to the transmission line and lower angle of radiation.

OMNIDIRECTIONAL 
CARDIOID 
UNIDIRECTIONAL 
zontal directional patterns are radiated by antennas incorpo- 
rating pattern- shaping design characteristics. A cardioid or 
heart -shaped pattern results in extended coverage over 180° 
by reshaping the omnidirectional pattern. A unidirectional 
pattern results when the antenna elements concentrate the 
signal more strongly in one general direction. (See Fig. 3. ) 
Many other lobe structures, in both horizontal and vertical 
planes, are obtainable with properly designed antennas or 
arrays. 
Directional Patterns 
An omnidirectional pattern fits the majority of applica- 
tions. Here the antenna is generally in the center of the 
user's operating area (Fig. 4). Coverage is required in 
every direction to maintain contact with mobile units during 
their normal travels. However, a user's operating area and 
communications requirements should be carefully analyzed 
to avoid placing too much reliance on an omnidirectional 
antenna when another pattern might do a more effective 
job. As an example, a cardioid pattern is more suitable for 
situations where maximum coverage is required in one gen- 
eral semicircular direction. Antennas located on lake or ocean 
shores fall into this category. A cardioid antenna directs the 
radiated energy over land instead of wasting half the output 
power over the water (Fig. 5) . 
Another example of a situation in which a cardioid pat- 
tern might be used to good advantage involves an organization 
whose antenna site is just outside of town. Radio coverage 
is desired within the town itself, with little call for coverage 
on the other side of the antenna. A cardioid antenna would 
shape the pattern to provide more complete in -town cover- 
age, while rejecting signals from outside the system's coverage 
area and thereby reduce interference to other radio systems 
on the antenna's non -radiating side. This is particularly bene- 
ficial in areas crowded with two -way radio users. A cardioid 
antenna is not always necessary to obtain this desired pattern; 
cardioid radiation can also be obtained by side -mounting an 
omnidirectional antenna the proper distance from a support- 
ing tower. In this case the tower structure acts as a parasitic 
element and re- radiates the energy to form the necessary 
concentration. 
More concentrated pattern -shaping is accomplished by a 
unidirectional or yagi- design antenna. This type pattern 
would fit the coverage requirements of a user interested in 
blanketing a specific site with a radio signal. Coverage of 
a city from a distant mountain site or right -of -way users, such 
as railroads and pipelines, are examples of systems which 
ELECTRONICS WORLD 

might obtain more efficient coverage with an antenna that 
uses unidirectional radiation and reception. 
For bidirectional coverage, an omnidirectional antenna 
properly side -mounted and spaced on a tower will provide 
extra gain in the desired directions. The tower, in this case, 
is parasitically excited and serves as an antenna element to 
produce a bidirectional radiation pattern. However, more 
positive pattern control is obtained with an antenna specifi- 
cally designed for bidirectional radiation. 
The user who wants to extend the fringes of his omnidirec- 
tional pattern-to talk a bit farther and to take in new op- 
erating areas -can take advantage of omnidirectional high - 
gain antennas in the v.h.f. and u.h.f. bands. For a low -band 
user, a higher antenna location or increased base -station 
power may have to fill the bill. In most cases, the large size 
required for a low -band, high -gain antenna precludes its use. 
An antenna producing 3 -db omnidirectional gain in the 
25- 54 -mc. band, for example, would have to be at least 30 
feet long at 40 mc. Gain antennas are more practical in the 
higher frequency bands. 
The high -gain omnidirectional antenna, just like the other 
special -pattern antennas, shapes and concentrates the radia- 
tion signal coverage. Instead of shaping on the horizontal 
plane, however, the high -gain omnidirectional antenna works 
vertically. The "doughnut" pattern is flattened and, as a 
result, its over -all coverage is increased. The fringe perform- 
ance is thereby extended. ( See Fig. 1.) 
Antenna Gain 
The choice of high -gain antennas must be weighed against 
what similar range- boosting effects might be gained from 
IA) Omnidirectional coaxial folded dipole antenna. The coax 
skirt replaces the ground -plane rods cutting wind resistance.

increasing base -station power or placing a regular antenna at 
a higher location. A "rule of thumb" suggests that a 3 -db 
gain for the antenna is equivalent to a 100% increase in base - 
station power; a 6 -db gain is equivalent to a 100% increase 
in antenna height. This power increase, relative to a resonant 
half -wave dipole, is called effective radiated power. Another 
point to keep in mind is that an increase in base -station power 
does not affect an antenna's receiving capability, whereas 
an increase in antenna height and /or the use of a high -gain 
antenna insures better reception from the fringe areas of a 
system, as well as increased talking range for the base station. 
Gain is an indication of an antenna's ability to increase 
its effective radiated power in the desired direction or direc- 
tions. However, to have any meaning, gain must be relative 
to some standard. The practical standard against which gain 
is measured is the center -fed half -wave dipole antenna. This 
March, 1963 
antenna has its maximum energy radiated in a plane per- 
pendicular to the antenna. Sometimes the gain reference is 
an isotropic radiator: a theoretical point in space which is 
emitting radiation. Its pattern is shaped like a sphere, with 
the antenna spotted in the center. Equal energy is radiated 
in all directions. Generally, this pattern is used only as the 
basic gain standard for parabolic and other microwave an- 
tennas. Lack of directivity causes the isotropic radiator to 
have about 2.15 -db less gain than a half -wave dipole. Con- 
sequently, a two -way radio antenna which uses a theoretical 
isotropic radiator as a reference can have an apparent 2.15 -db 
gain and yet exhibit no gain relative to a center -fed half -wave

A SOUND - OPERATED 
FIBEROPTIC "BRAIN CELL" 
A new optical pattern recognizer that "understands" spoken commands. It may find future 
use in dial -less phones, key -less cash registers, and typewriters that take dictation. 
By LEO S. BALANDIS/ Sperry Gyroscope Co., Div. Sperry Rand Corp. 
C'LN machines think? This question has been asked 
many times since the advent of high -speed digital 
computers. A recent invention by Robert D. Hawkins 
of Sperry Gyroscope Company comes close to being a "brain 
cell" -and is able to think, in the Webster dictionary sense 
of "to have or form ... a mental picture." In fact, this device 
-the Sceptron -literally has a photographic memory and 
makes decisions by comparing incoming signals with the in- 
formation that is contained in its memory. 
36 
Author Balandis triggers a Sceptron that has been "taught" 
to react when he says the word "five." Every time this word 
is spoken the numeral is lighted on the display illustrated. 
So far, this could be the description of a typical electronic 
computer, and its operation is conceivably within the capa- 
bility of computers if space and cost are thrown out the win- 
dow. The resemblance stops there. This device uses mechan- 
ical motion, light, tiny glass or quartz fibers, a photocell, and 
electricity. Its operating principles, as you might expect, 
are completely different from devices used in ordinary com- 
puters. Before we examine details of its operation, let's con- 
sider what Sceptron can do, and what needs it fulfills. 
A Pattern Recognizer 
Sceptron stands for Spectral Comparative Pattern Recog- 
nizer -which indicates that it can identify signals by their 
spectra or frequency content. The term "pattern recognizer" 
has been chosen because it is a current technical idiom ap- 
plied to machines which can identify sounds, images, or other 
patterns. Sceptron can be exposed to any signal in the audio - 
frequency range, and it will memorize it. Then it will rec- 
ognize it when it is repeated. Although this would seem to 
restrict the device to recognizing sounds, it actually can 
be applied to any information which can be translated into 
an audio rate. For instance, a picture might be scanned by 
a revolving slit and photocell such that a complex audio 
signal is generated. If this signal represents the significant 
features of the picture, then Sceptron will memorize and 
recognize it just as it does for a signal that is audio to begin 
with. Similarly, signals normally outside the audio band 
can be speeded up or slowed down by means of a tape re- 
corder. Human heart beats, for instance, could be memorized 
and any irregularities in a patient's pattern would be im- 
mediately detected. 
Within the audio range applications are numerous. Spoken 
ELECTRONICS WORLD 

words are an immediate example. Sceptron has been success- 
fully demonstrated with human speech. When exposed to a 
word spoken by one person, the device has correctly identified 
the word out of continuous speech. 
Sceptron's memory feats stem from its ability to make 
hundreds of measurements on a complex signal. To recognize 
spoken words, for instance, it has been suggested that about 
3000 measurements per second are required. A single short 
word, such as one of the first ten numbers, lasts for less than 
a half second. Therefore, a device which can make on the 
order of 1500 measurements can memorize the essential 
characteristics of a single word. 
Although these measurements could be of many types, 
Sceptron is designed to make frequency measurements. This 
is where its unusual nature reveals itself: it is capable of 
packing 300,000 narrow bandpass filters in a volume of only 
a cubic inch. Obviously, this device is capable of handling 
a tremendous amount of information. Let's consider how 
it does it. 
Basic Components 
The basic components for a single Sceptron are shown in 
an exploded view on the cover. The fiber -optic array is the 
unique element. It is an open bundle of tiny quartz fibers, 
all held at one end. All fibers are approximately the same 
diameter, but their free lengths vary. Thus, each is a tiny 
cantilever beam, and will vibrate in its own fashion when- 
ever it is mechanically excited at its natural frequency. There 
is sufficient space around each fiber so that it can vibrate 
in ally direction without striking other fibers. The size of 
the fiber arrays with which we are working is fi cubic inch 
and it contains 700 fibers. We have also worked with tiny 
1/300 cubic inch arrays containing even more fibers. 
The fiber array requires a source of mechanical excitation. 
The driver provides this by converting electrical signals into 
proportional mechanical motion. The driver could be a piezo- 
electric device, as shown on the cover, or it could be elec- 
tromagnetic like an ordinary loudspeaker. Signals to be 
processed are fed into the driver which, in turn, shakes the 
fiber array mounted on it. 
Some means of detecting the pattern of fiber motion is re- 
quired; this is provided by shining light through the fibers 
onto a photocell. If we also place a photographic plate be- 
tween the fibers and the photocell, we can take a negative 
picture of the light pattern during passage of the signal. 
Each fiber that vibrates for that signal will leave a black line 
on the negative picture. (Note that as the fiber moves it 
carries its own tiny light beam with it.) Those that do not 
move will leave a small spot corresponding to its stationary 
or static position. Everywhere else, the plate will be trans- 
parent. When developed, this plate is the memory of Scep- 
tron, and it will be mounted with the array in its housing. 
How it Works 
Now let's consider how signal recognition is achieved. The 
mask is made by exposing it to the pattern of fiber motion 
during the time that the signal is on. (See Fig. 1.) It is de- 
veloped and placed back in its original position. In the ab- 
sence of any signal, the photocell will be in the dark, since 
The tiny masks by which the unit is programmed to recognize 
words are easily interchangeable, thereby changing its vocab- 
ulary. 
A 
small lever- controlled platen permits the change 
and allows proper positioning to be made. The Sceptron is 
shown here mounted on the diaphragm of an ordinary magnetic 
loudspeaker which 
is used to excite array of optical fibers.

developed negative and the acceptance mask is a positive. 
each fiber light spot will be blocked by a black spot on the 
mask. When a signal is received, the fibers will again vibrate 
in some pattern characteristic of that signal. If it is the same 
signal, all the light will still be blocked by the mask; if 
different, some light will get through because the mask pat- 
tern will not be matched. Thus, the photocell can tell us 
whether or not the signal is the same by virtue 'of the amount 
of light it sees.

TRA )VSIS TORIZED 
POWER SUPPLIES 
By JOHN R. COLLINS 
A survey of several different types of power 
supplies, special applications, and a discussion 
of their circuit designs and operation. 
ONE OF the most useful instruments in a research and 
development laboratory or on the test bench is a reg- 
ulated power supply, capable of providing a stable 
voltage which does not change with fluctuations in either 
line voltage or the load current. Nov that transistors able 
to handle sizable amounts of power are available, transis- 
torized power supplies are finding increasing use. Compared 
to vacuum -tube designs, transistorized supplies are generally 
smaller and lighter- important factors for mobile equipment 
or on a crowded bench -their efficiency is higher, and they 
do not require warm -up time. 
One of the many different types of transistorized power 
supplies now available is shown in Fig. 1. Made by Harrison 
Laboratories, Inc., it is designed to provide any desired output 
between 0 and 60 volts. Load -current variations from 0 to 
Fig. 
1. 
Rack -mounted transistorized 
power supply that 
is 
designed 
to maintain either a constant- voltage or a constant- current output. 
The voltage range is 0 -60 and the current range is 0 -7.5 amperes. 
7.5 amperes and fluctuations in the line voltage between 105 
and 125 volts will cause changes in the output of less than 
0.02 per -cent or 10 mv., whichever is greater. 
A special feature of this instrument is that it can be oper- 
ated either as a constant -voltage or a constant- current supply. 
This is accomplished by means of a special current- limiting 
circuit which may be adjusted to any desired value. In opera- 
tion, the supply will function as a constant -voltage regulator 
until the load current reaches the selected level, after which 
the current will remain constant despite further lowering of 
the load resistance. The instrument can be deliberately oper- 
ated as a constant- current supply simply by setting the cur- 
rent limit control to the desired value of output current, and 
the output- voltage control to a value greater than the highest 
IR drop which will occur across the load. 
Current -limiting circuits protect instruments of this kind 
40 
even if the output is directly short- circuited. This feature also 
safeguards delicate test circuits, which may be connected to 
the power supply, against accidental overloads. 
Automatic test systems often require several different volt- 
ages to be applied in rapid sequence, and this requirement 
is sometimes fulfilled by using a different power supply for 
each voltage needed. However, the "Programmable Regatran" 
power supply (Fig. 2) made by Electronic Measurements Co. 
is specially designed for the rapid and remote selection of 
output voltages. 
The unit is designed so that the output voltage at the "- 
and " +" terminals is determined by the resistance connected 
between the " +" and "Rem" (remote) terminals. This is in 
contrast to most regulated power supplies, in which the out- 
put voltage is selected by the setting of a potentiometer on 
Fig. 2. Programmable power supply designed to provide a rapid series 
of output voltages through remote switching

resistors. 
the front panel. In the "Programmable Regatran" supply, the 
output follows a fixed ohms -per -volt ratio called the program- 
ming constant which is usually 1000 ohms -per -volt. Thus a 
47,000 -ohm control resistor would develop a 47 volt d.c. out- 
put. 
An elaborate test setup for automatic operation is shown 
in Fig. 5. Four separate voltage regulator units permit four 
simultaneous voltages to be applied to the test circuit and, 
with seven resistors for each unit, a total of 28 test voltages 
is available. 
Control resistors of selected values to provide the needed 
voltages are arranged sequentially, and a stepping switch 
connects them into the circuit. Since an open circuit would 
cause an uncontrolled voltage rise which might damage the 
test circuit, precautions are taken to prevent opens. In par- 
ticular, make -before -break switches are used to retain contact 
ELECTRONICS WORLD 

with one resistor until contact with the next resistor is estab- 
lished. A shielded coaxial cable is generally used to connect 
the control resistors to the power supply. This precaution 
prevents the injection of noise and ripple from external 
sources into the test circuit. 
A portable transistorized power supply, made by Sorensen 
is shown in Fig. 3. It will provide any selected voltage be- 
tween 0 and 40 volts at up to 5 amperes. It is recommended 
by the manufacturer for powering critical transistor circuits 
or for supplying a stable voltage for computers and communi- 
cations circuits. While the model shown has a handle for 
carrying, companion units are designed for rack mounting. 
A different kind of power supply, also made by Sorensen, 
is shown in Fig. 4. Compact units of this kind contain a trans- 
former and rectifier, and a completely transistorized voltage 
regulation system with a zener -diode reference, transistor 
amplifier, and a current -passing transistor. They are available 
for voltage outputs from 3 to 48 volts and for current up to 5 
amperes. However, individual units are adjustable over only 
a relatively small range, and this adjustment is made with a 
screwdriver. 
These miniature units are intended for use as highly stable 
supplies for transistor circuits, for regulated bias supplies for 
vacuum tubes, and as power sources for critical laboratory or 
production -line test equipment. An interesting application is 
the furnishing of d.c. for the filaments of vacuum tubes in 
low -level amplifiers where a.c. hum pickup is possible. 
Elementary Circuit 
The components of a transistorized power supply regu- 
lator circuit are shown in block -diagram form in Fig. 6A. 
After rectification, the unregulated d.c. voltage is applied to 
the regulator input terminals. The output voltage is sampled 
and this sample is compared to an internal reference voltage. 
If they are not the same, the difference is amplified and used 
to operate a control element which adjusts the output current 
in such a way as to maintain the output voltage at a pre- 
selected level. 
It is apparent from Fig. 6A that a transistorized power

supply is a form of servomechanism, since the output is sam- 
pled and an error signal is derived which is used to correct 
the input. Such corrections are made instantaneously, and the 
output remains substantially constant at all times. 
A simple voltage -regulator circuit is shown in Fig. 6B. The 
control element, sometimes called the passing transistor, is 
n -p -n transistor Q1. It is connected in series with the line so 
that the full load current passes through it. In this configura- 
tion it acts as a valve and its conduction is varied to regulate 
the voltage at the output of the power supply. When the 
voltage (i.e., the IR drop) across the load resistance starts to 
increase, Q1 reduces the amount of current flow to bring the 
output voltage back to the original level. Conversely, when 
the output voltage starts to decrease, Q1 permits more current 
flow until the condition is corrected. 
The opening and closing of the valve are controlled by the 
collector current of another n -p -n transistor, Q2, which serves 
both as the comparison element and the amplifier. An exam- 
ination of the diagram will show that changes in Q2's collector 
current and the current through Q1 are out of phase. As a 
result, an increase in Q2's collector current will cause a reduc- 
tion in Q1's collector current and hence a reduction in the 
load current. Stated another way, an increase in the base - 
emitter voltage of Q2 (which will increase its collector cur- 
rent) will cause the output of the supply to decrease. 
The reference voltage is supplied by a silicon diode, CR1, 
connected in the reverse direction, as shown. Often called

zener diodes, silicon- breakdown diodes have characteristics 
similar to voltage -regulator tubes. When they are subjected 
to a reverse potential, a very small current will flow and volt- 
age will build up across their terminals until the breakdown 
point is reached. At this point, current passes freely through 
the diode in the reverse direction and prevents any further 
build up of voltage. The effect is to stabilize the voltage at the 
breakdown level and to prevent any further increase. Since 
the zener diode is connected between the negative terminal 
of the power supply and the emitter of Q2, the emitter is held 
at a constant potential with respect to the negative terminal. 
The entire output voltage is dropped across a potentiometer, 
R, and a sample voltage is selected by adjusting the wiper 
contact of the potentiometer. 
The setting of the potentiometer determines the fraction 
of the output voltage to be compared to the reference voltage. 
Any difference between the selected fraction of the output 
voltage and the reference voltage becomes an error signal 
which is amplified by Q2 and used to regulate the current 
through Q1. It is evident that the magnitude of the output 
voltage can be determined, within the operating limits of the 
transistors, by the setting of the potentiometer, since the 
action of the circuit is such as to adjust the output voltage 
so that the selected fraction will equal the reference voltage. 
Once the output level has been selected, any fluctuation 
which causes a change in the output voltage will also cause 
a proportional change in the selected fraction which is com- 
pared to the reference voltage. A correction is made auto- 
matically as described above.

A more elaborate voltage regulator diagram, provided by 
Texas Instruments Inc., is shown in Fig. 7. An important 
feature is the pre -regulator, macle up of resistors R1, R2, and 
CR2. The function of the pre -regulator is to provide a con- 
stant current to the collector of d.c. amplifier Q1 and the 
base of control transistor, Q2. If point A is returned through 
a resistor directly to the positive terminal of the unregulated 
supply, as in Fig. 6B, ripple current caused by the unregu- 
lated voltage variations will be injected into the base of Q2. 
This ripple will be amplified by Q2 and Q3 and will appear 
in the output. CR2 and associated resistors help eliminate 
this difficulty. CR2 maintains a constant voltage across R2 
and a constant current to Q2 and Q3. In addition to improv- 
ing input regulation, the pre -regulator contributes to output 
stability. 
As in the previous example, Q1 serves both as the compari- 
son element and the d.c. amplifier. Cl is the phase -shift 
capacitor. It provides a margin against high -frequency insta- 
bility by modifying the gain -phase characteristics of the d.c. 
amplifier. A capacitor connected this way has the same effect 
as a capacitor from the base of the control element to the 
negative side of the power supply. It does, however, allow 
a much smaller capacitor to be used. 
It is obviously necessary that the collector current of Q1 
be great enough to serve as the base drive of the control ele- 
ment. This requirement may be substantial, since the base - 
drive current must be adequate to maintain the required out- 
put current over a considerable range. Because the current 
supplied to the base of the control element is usually small, 
it is often convenient to use a combination of two transistors, 
as shown. This method of connection reduces the current 
requirements of both transistors and permits the use of tran- 
sistors of lower power ratings for the control element. C2, 
a large capacitor (about 100 µf.) is connected across the 
output terminals to improve ripple suppression and reduce 
transients from the load. 
Shunt - Voltage Regulators 
The power supplies discussed above are called series volt- 
age regulators, since the control element is in series with 
the load. Where only small fluctuations in the load are ex- 
pected, it is often convenient to use a shunt voltage regulator 
of the type shown in Fig. 8. 
In shunt -type power supplies, a resistor (R1) is placed in 
series with the load and the control transistor is connected 
across the load. As in the previous example, the emitter 
of the control transistor is held at a constant potential with 
respect to the negative terminal by a zener diode. The poten- 
tiometer is set so that the transistor base is slightly positive 
with respect to the emitter. If the output voltage increases, 
the base of the control transistor Nvill become more positive 
with respect to the emitter, and this will cause an increase 
in the collector current. Since the collector current flows 
through the series resistor, the voltage drop across it will 
increase. In this way, the output voltage is corrected to its 
former value. 
Because of the voltage drop across the series resistor, the 
shunt regulator is not as efficient as the series type. It is 
simpler to construct, however. For this reason, the configura- 
tion is often used where it is desired to control a relatively 
constant load.

AN AM -FM 
CAR RADIO 
By T. A. PREWITT / 
Avoiding circuit duplication without 
impairing performance was the goal. This 
is how Delco Radio engineers handled 
the problem in a transistorized design. 
Delco Radio Div., General Motors Corp. 
IN THE PAST several years, the listening audience for 
FM radio has grown enormously. Established stations 
have added more powerful transmitting equipment and 
better antennas to increase their coverage areas; the number 
of new stations has increased at a rapid rate. 
Furthermore, a large percentage of today's many FM 
listeners live, work, shop, and consequently spend a number 
of hours every week driving within the metropolitan and 
suburban areas served by such stations. For these persons, 
practical reception of FM signals while they are in their 
vehicles has much attraction now. 
Yet an FM -only receiver is not likely to satisfy the listener's 
needs. There will be occasions on which he may not be able 
to get the FM reception he wants -or simply prefers to listen 
to something available only on an AM broadcast. The ideal 
radio for him, then, must be designed to receive both services. 
Since he will be using only one at a time, completely sepa- 
rate circuitry for both bands is wasteful. Furthermore, there 
are obvious advantages in using transistorized circuitry, with 
respect both to reliability and the power -supply simplification 
made possible by direct use of a 12 -volt d.c. electrical system. 
In its 1963 car models, General Motors offers for the first 
time a line of custom -designed AM -FM receivers. Built by 
Delco Radio, these sets have all- transistor circuitry in which 
a number of interesting features appear. 
A representative version is model 1283295, used in Cadillac 
vehicles, shown in Fig. 1. The FM tuning section is at the 
top right, the main circuit board in the center, and the com- 
mon power- output stage to the left. Such bandswitching as 
is used is accomplished by depressing the appropriate end 
of the pivoted, horizontal bar just above the tuning dial. 
To illustrate the circuit approach employed, a block dia- 
gram (Fig. 2) will serve as well as a complete schematic. 
But for the diode -using detectors, each stage or block con- 
veniently represents one transistor -nine in all. The number 
44 
of semiconductor diodes used -is also nine. In addition to the 
separate detectors, these are employed in separate a.g.e. sys- 
tems for the two bands, the a.f.c loop for FM, and voltage 
regulation for stabilizing the supply to the FM front -end 
stages. 
Each band has its own tuned, r.f. stage. For FM, there are 
four i.f. stages, with the last two acting as limiters on stronger 
signals. The a.f.c. action is achieved with a voltage -variable 
diode capacitor, whereas the semiconductor stabilizing the 
supply is a zener regulator. The AM band has its independent 
oscillator. With these features, both high -quality performance 
on FM and high sensitivity on AM are obtained. 
Combining Circuit Functions 
Two fundamental approaches were available to the design 
engineers. The first was to start with a conventional AM 
receiver and add an FM tuning section, i.f. strip, and de- 
tector. A very simple switch could then apply the output of 
the desired detector to a common audio amplifier. Alternative- 
ly, the number of components used could be reduced sub- 
stantially by making the r.f., converter, and i.f. stages of the 
AM channel function as FM i.f. amplifiers. Ordinarily this 
would involve the use of a complex bandswitch that would be 
a potential source of trouble. 
After further study of the second approach, a method was 
developed to make these stages serve a dual purpose without 
the use of switch contacts through the use of automatic signal 
path switching. This general technique, which is based on 
the difference in frequency between signals in FM and AM 
service and the consequent involvement of different resonant 
circuits in each dual- purpose stage, is not a new one. As 
a rule, however, the result is some compromising of perform- 
ance on each band. In the case of the all- transistor design, 
it was possible to minimize the effect of these compromises. 
With reference to Fig. 2, it can be seen that the FM -AM 
ELECTRONICS WORLD 

switch involves only three circuits. Antenna signal is applied 
to either the FM or AM r.f. amplifier; supply voltage is ap- 
plied to (or removed from) either the FM front -end tran- 
sistors or the AM local oscillator; and output from the appro- 
priate detector is chosen for audio amplification. 
A simplified schematic of the two stages that serve as mixer 
and i.f. on AM or 2nd i.f. and 1st limiter on FM (Fig. 3), 
showing interstage coupling, illustrates how automatic signal 
switching is arranged. 
The primaries of transformers T10 (10.7 -mc. FM i.f.) and 
T6 ( 262 -kc. AM i.f.) are in series in the collector circuit of 
transistor Q5. However the secondary of T10 is connected in 
the emitter circuit of transistor Q6, while the secondary of T6 
is placed in the base circuit of Q6. 
When the bandswitch, not shown, is in the AM position, 
operating power is applied to the AM oscillator, the car an- 
tenna is connected to the AM tuner, and 262 -kc. i.f. signals 
appear in the common i.f. strip. Since the tapped portion of 
the T10 primary consists of only a few turns, it offers little 
impedance to the 262 -kc. signal, all of which, in effect, then 
appears across the T6 primary. 
On the AM band, it is desirable to obtain high i.f. gain. 
This is accomplished by operating Q6 as a common- emitter 
stage. The secondary tap of T10, also a low- impedance path 
to 262 -kc. signals, ties the emitter of Q6 to ground through 
capacitor C33. The secondary of T6, which is connected in 
the base circuit of Q6, completes the common -emitter con- 
figuration. 
I.f. amplifiers are operated in the common -base mode on 
FM to simplify switching and eliminate the need for neutral- 
ization. The change is accomplished as follows: The 330 -µµf. 
capacitor across the primary tap of T6 bypasses the 10.7 -mc. 
signals; therefore the full signal voltage appears across the 
1'10 primary. Likewise, the .0022 -µf. capacitor across the 
secondary tap of T6 bypasses the base of Q6 to ground 
through capacitor C36. The T10 secondary injects the 10.7 - 
Inc. signal into the emitter of Q6, which thus operates as a 
common -base amplifier. 
Coupling to Q5 from the AM oscillator and r.f. stage, on 
the one hand, and from the FM tuning section, on the other 
hand, is somewhat different. Nevertheless, the same principle 
of separating and optimizing performance for each band is 
followed. 
Since the same vertical whip is used as antenna for recep- 
tion on either band, the problems of optimizing for either 
service occur here too. Since transmitted FM signals are 
horizontally polarized, there is some reduction in the strength 
of received signal. Most owners would prefer this sacrifice 
to having a conventional FM antenna on the car. On the other 
hand, the whip offers the advantage of being substantially 
omnidirectional. In practice, a change of only 2 or 3 db in 
signal is noted when the car turns a corner, which minimizes 
or eliminates audible changes. With the antenna adjusted to 
its recommended length (31 inches) its base impedance is 
approximately 50 ohms in the FM band. The tuner is designed 
to operate from this base impedance. 
For optimum signal transfer to the AM tuner, the lead -in 
cable must be the usual low- capacitance type, which has a 
characteristically high impedance of 160 ohms when used as 
a v.h.f. transmission line. To avoid impedance mismatch and 
standing waves on FM, this line is cut to half a wavelength 
at the center of the FM band. It accordingly repeats the 
50 -ohm impedance of the whip antenna at the input of the 
FM tuner. 
Reception Range 
Through long experience, the driver -listener has formed 
an idea of what kind of performance he can expect from a 
well- designed AM car receiver. He will have questions, how- 
ever, as to how much usable reception he can obtain on FM 
in a moving vehicle. Conventional statements, like the num- 
March, 1963 
ber of microvolts required for a given quieting level, in db, 
will have little practical meaning. Nor are claims of reception 
up to a given number of miles much better. 
Transmitter power, terrain, and the presence or absence of 
prominent signal- reflecting objects all enter into a determi- 
nation of satisfactory reception at the receiver. The chart in 
Fig. 4, therefore, probably gives the most realistic picture of 
what is possible. Assuming only a reasonably unobstructed 
location in level or gently rolling terrain, it shows the range 
of satisfactory reception at the radio installed in the car as a 
function of transmitter power. 
Reception of out -of -town stations within a metropolitan 
area will be reduced by surrounding, tall buildings. The graph 
will hold, however, in the more usual case: reception from a 
metropolitan station as the vehicle moves toward or from it in 
outlying areas. A transmitter whose effective radiated power 
is 25 kw., for example, will provide good reception more than 
20 miles away. A four -fold increase in e.r.p. will double the 
reception range.

TRANSISTORIZED 
HI -FI AMPLIFIER 
By STANLEY E. BAMMEL 
Construction of an output- transformerless 
amplifier employing inexpensive transistors 
-for use with efficient loudspeaker systems. 
IT is we11 known that from the standpoint of size and 
power consumption, transistors offer tremendous ad- 
vantages as compared to tubes. Unfortunately, transis- 
tors often suffer from the disadvantage of rather complex 
circuitry which tends towards high cost. However, the ab- 
sence of an expensive output transformer and the availability 
of inexpensive, good -quality transistors has largely offset this 
disadvantage. 
The absence of an output transformer also offers per- 
formance advantages. Its unusually large amount of phase 
shift at low and high frequencies limits the amount of nega- 
tive feedback which can be used if an adequate stability 
margin is to be maintained. The amplifier to be described 
has about 40 db of feedback in each of its two main loops. 
There is plenty of stability as evidenced by the absence of 
overshoot in the square -wave response.

Front view of amplifier. The two output transistors are 
mounted atop the chassis but one is insulated from it 
Signal input is to the base of Q 1 
( see Fig. 1) . Q 1 and Q2 
are connected in a negative feedback loop so that together 
they act as a single, low- distortion, high -gain transistor. C2 
provides positive feedback which increases the collector load 
impedance of Q1. This maintains high gain within the 
negative feedback loop. This high gain is essential in order 
to obtain maximum effectiveness of the negative feedback. 
Q1 receives the negative feedback via its emitter from the 
collector of Q2. 
The output of Q1 and Q2 is direct -coupled to Q3 which 
is a grounded -emitter stage. Q3 is then direct- coupled to Q4, 
another grounded -emitter stage. However, the emitter of Q3 
receives 100% negative voltage feedback from the output. 
This holds the voltage gain between Q3 and the output to 
unity. The feedback does not affect the current gain, how- 
ever, which is very high.

The output of Q4 is direct- coupled to Q5 and Q6. Q6 
and Q8 are both grounded -collector stages or emitter follow- 
ers. The voltage gain of an emitter follower is slightly less 
than unity, but its current gain is high. The effect of these 
two transistors can be considered that of a single, high -gain, 
high -power p -n -p emitter follower. 
Q5 and Q7 are connected in the same type of feedback 
loop as Q1 and Q2 whereby two transistors act as a single 
transistor. In this case, the pair of transistors is connected 
as an emitter follower. Its characteristics are identical to 
those of the pair Q6 and Q8 except that Q5 and Q7 act as 
an n -p -n transistor. This gives push -pull operation by allow- 
ing Q5 and Q7 to operate on positive half cycles and Q6 
and Q8 to operate on negative half cycles. 
The voltage drop across CRl biases Q7 and Q8 for a 
quiescent (no signal) current of approximately 1 ma. The

temperature characteristic of CR1 is in a direction to give 
temperature compensation to the output transistors. 
As an over -all result, all voltage gain takes place in Ql 
and Q2 and by far the greater part of the current gain takes 
place in the rest of the transistors. The use of localized nega- 
tive feedback rather than over -all feedback gives better sta- 
bility and overload characteristics, resulting in better tran- 
sient response. The large amount of current gain, in con- 
junction with the negative feedback, gives a very low output 
impedance, yielding good speaker damping. 
If you check the specifications of Q1 to Q4, you will find 
that their collector voltage ratings are 25 or 30 volts. Then 
you will notice that the power supply delivers 40 volts at 
quiescent conditions. This allows the collector voltage to 
swing considerably above its rating. However, the extensive 
use of local feedback gives much more voltage allowance. 
Over a considerable period of use and experiment, no trouble 
whatsoever has been encountered, except when using these 
transistors at higher power in the place of Q5 and Q6. There- 
fore, different transistors are used for the latter. These latter 
units are more expensive and have better voltage ratings 
but, due to inadequate frequency response, cannot be used 
as substitutes for Ql to Q4. 
Any substitutions for Q7 and Q8 should be undertaken 
carefully. The 2N307's called for have outstanding frequency 
and low- leakage characteristics compared to several other 
inexpensive power transistors tested. Unless a substitute 
March, 1963 
compares very favorably with these transistors, difficulty will 
be experienced with both thermal and high- frequency sta- 
bility. 
A "Slo -Blo" ,i -amp fuse is used in the a.c. line. If this type 
is not used, the surge when the amplifier is turned on will 
blow an ordinary fuse. At steady high power output, for 
which the amplifier is not intended, the fuse may blow. How- 
ever, it is considered adequate for all program material while 
giving maximum protection against accidental output short- 
ing. 
Construction 
The amplifier is completely contained on a 2" x 33í" x 6" 
aluminum chassis. C10 is mounted on the chassis with the 
metal mounting supplied with it since its can is grounded. 
C9, however, must be insulated with the insulating mounting 
plate supplied. As a matter of personal safety, use insulating 
tape on all exposed a.c. line connections. 
Q8 is fastened directly to the chassis since its collector is 
grounded. Q7 must be insulated, however. Use an insulating 
washer which is specified for this purpose. Some manufac- 
turers ( Sylvania among them) supply such a mica washer 
with each of their power transistors. Mount the washer be- 
tween Q7 and the chassis. In addition, the mounting holes 
must be larger than the screws in order to permit insulation 
between the screws and the chassis. Use insulating washers 
on the 'underside of the chassis as well. 
In order to achieve necessary cooling, the power transistors 
are mounted on the chassis. Thermal conduction between the 
transistors and chassis can be enhanced by the use of silicone 
grease (Dow Corning DC4 or equivalent). Before mounting, 
apply this grease to both the under side of the transistors and 
the chassis. With Q7, apply the grease to the insulating 
washer as well. Tighten mounting screws well so that the 
transistors make firm contact with the chassis. 
Connectors to the power transistors can be obtained from 
an old 7- or 9 -pin miniature tube socket. It is not a good idea 
to attempt to solder directly to the transistors. Connection

By R. L. CONHAIM, 19W7577 
THE proposed new regulations for the Citizens Radio 
Service should go a long Way toward cleaning up 
operations on this overcrowded and often misused 
band. True, as with any regulations, they have their pros 
and cons. But one place, in the author's opinion, where 
the FCC missed a bet is their failure to do something 
about better adherence to the technical standards set up 
for the class D Citizens Band. 
First, let us hasten to say that nothing in the technical 
standards in sub -part C of Part 19 of the FCC Rules and 
Regulations is unfair or difficult to achieve. But, the fact 
that so many stations are off frequency, so many are over- 
modulating, so many are using too much power, is evi- 
dence that something is wrong. And, it is not only the 
transmitters used by the renegades on the band that are 
failing to meet technical requirements. One has only to 
make routine, off- the -air frequency checks of even the 
most law- abiding users, and he will find many cases of 
off- frequency operation. 
When you compare the requirements of Part 19 with 
other services, such as industrial, business radio, public 
safety, and land transportation services, you will find little 
in Part 19 that differs radically from the regulations ap- 
plying to these other services. The big difference arises 
from the fact that no one could possibly have forecast the 
tremendous popularity of the class D band, or that there 
would be 350,000 licenses issued in just a few years. 
Licenses for Servicing 
All of the services mentioned, including the Citizens 
Band, require a holder of a second -class commercial radio- 
telephone license, or better, to make any adjustments to 
a transmitter that would affect its operating frequency, 
modulation, or maximum output power. The purpose of 
this requirement is to assure the maintenance of technical 
standards. The technical standards for all bands have been 
set up to assure maximum utilization of available spectrum 
space, and the least possible interference to users within 
the same band or on other bands. 
Equipment for all these other bands is sold and serviced 
by specialists in the field. The equipment, in practically 
all cases, is considerably more expensive than Citizens 
Band transceivers, a single mobile transmitter -receiver 
combination costing close to $500.00 or even more. Service 
for such equipment can obviously be expected to cost 
more. A routine survey indicates that maintenance con- 
tract service may cost from $5.00 to $8.00 per month, 
per mobile unit, and more for base stations. A frequency 
check of a single- or dual -channel transmitter usually costs 
in the neighborhood of $5.00. This kind of business is 
worthwhile for the professional service organizations in- 
volved, and the trouble of securing and maintaining a 
first- or second -class radiotelephone license is worth the 
effort. 
But, the sad truth concerning Citizens Band is that en- 
tirely too few holders of first- or second -class commercial 
radiotelephone licenses are interested in selling, installing, 
or servicing CB equipment -and for a variety of reasons. 
Most of the professional service organizations which han- 
dle two -way radio are too busy selling and maintaining 
the higher priced and more profitable equipment used in 
other services. Others have expressed the opinion that 
some CB equipment is not built to high technical standards 
and requires too much time to align, adjust, or repair, and 
that CB -ers are unwilling to pay their regular rates. Many 
persons employed by radio stations, governmental agen- 
cies, or large users of commercial radio equipment are 
unavailable for CB repair because of the requirements of 
their regular jobs. Occasionally, you will find a qualified 
license holder who is willing to perform CB service on a 
part -time basis during his off hours. But there aren't 
enough of these people, nor enough hours to take care 
of the CB equipment which needs adjustment or main- 
tenance. 
In talking with other organizations, the author has fre- 
quently encountered the attitude that CB requires dif- 
ferent test equipment, or entails the making of too many 
test harnesses because of the lack of standardization. For 
these reasons, the organization in question is unwilling to 
make the expenditures to secure the necessary equipment 
to service CB. 
So here we are, with a crowded band of ardent users, 
forced by circumstances or disregard for regulations to 
dabble unlawfully with their own equipment, or to have 
it serviced by unqualified personnel. Is it any wonder that 
there is such great laxity at the present time in the main- 
tenance of the proper technical standards? 
CB -A Special Case 
CB, by its own growth pattern, has made of itself a 
very special case, and will undoubtedly have to be treated 
as such. Is there any necessity for the requirement that 
most transmitter adjustments and repairs have to be made 
or supervised by the holder of a first- or second -class com- 
mercial radiotelephone license? Unquestionably, there is 
a need for competent repair services, and in order to 
establish high standards such repair personnel should be 
licensed. But certainly the knowledge required to repair 
CB equipment is nowhere nearly as extensive as that re- 
quired in other services. The holder of a second -class com- 
mercial license must pass a written examination, on which 
he must demonstrate his knowledge of all manner of elec- 
tronic theory and circuitry -much of which is not appli- 
cable to CB. It is no wonder, then, that few people have 
applied for such a license for the sole purpose of main- 
taining CB equipment. 
It becomes quite obvious, when one analyzes the prob- 
lem, that if CB technical standards are to be maintained, 
something must be done to find a more practical solution 
to the problem of adjusting and repairing transmitters. 
It is equally obvious that until some practical solution to 
this problem is found, technical standards on the class D 
Citizens Band cannot be maintained, and irresponsible 
dabbling with equipment is going to continue. 
A Practical Solution 
In looking for a solution, we have to be practical. We 
must find some source of technically adequate repair 
service which is readily available to the average CB -er and 
at the same time a source which will assure the mainte- 
nance of technical standards to the satisfaction of the 
FCC. Unquestionably, such sources will have to he li-

The acceptance of this proposal should go 
a long way in getting better repair service

of gear not meeting technical requirements. 
censed to prove their ability to maintain technical stand- 
ards. But knowledge of CB equipment is not hard to 
acquire especially if the student is already familiar with 
electronic circuitry and theory. Fortunately, there is a 
very large pool of such "raw material" already available. 
We are speaking, of course, of the large number of TV- 
radio service technicians and technically qualified CB 
users, who with very little study, and proper equipment, 
could become the nucleus of an efficient, capable, and 
widespread service facility for all users of CB equipment. 
The author therefore proposes to the Federal Communi- 
cations Commission a special class of license which would 
authorize the holder to align, repair, and measure CB 
equipment to maintain it in accordance with the technical 
requirements of Part 19 of the Commission's Rules and 
Regulations. But, more than just requesting such considera- 
tion, let's spell out in detail how such a class of license 
would be set up, what its requirements would be, and 
how such license holders would function. 
Sonic of the Details 
The special class of license for which we ask consid- 
eration might be called Citizens Radio Technician Class 
License. Each applicant for such a license would be re- 
quired to prove his knowledge of radio laws and treaties, 
as they pertain to Citizens Band operation. He would have 
to be able to pass a written examination divided into two 
parts. Part one would cover knowledge of Part 19 of the 
Commission's Rules and Regulations and any other part 
referenced in Part 19. Part two would cover technical 
knowledge, specifically limited to Citizens Band circuitry, 
especially to transmitters with 5 watts or less of input 
power. Included would be all modulation, oscillator, and 
r.f. power circuits, antenna coupling, transmission line, 
and antenna theory, specifically as applied to Citizens 
Radio Service. Because by far the greatest problems in 
the Citizens Radio Service exist in class D, the technical 
requirements would only cover class D and the license 
would be good only for working on class D equipment. 
If the Commission saw fit, additional tests could be given 
on classes A and B and those applicants passing this addi- 
tional phase could be authorized to work on the higher 
frequency tranceivers. In the absence of such provisions, 
class A and B transmitters would have to be adjusted and 
repaired by holders of regular second -class commercial 
licenses. 
Because a great many people might qualify for such a 
license, and to prevent an excessive work load for FCC 
examiners, the Citizens Radio Band Technical License 
examination could be taken by mail much like the present 
Amateur Technician Class License. In the case of a Citi- 
zens Band Technician License, however, the examination 
would be given by the holder of a first- or second -class 
commercial radiotelephone license. 
The license would permit the holder to work on any 
class D equipment, but if he did so as a commercial service 
for which he charged a fee, he would have to demonstrate 
to the Commission, upon request, that he had equipment 
capable of reading frequency, harmonic radiation, modu- 
lation percentage, and power output within specified 
tolerances. 
If such a license were made official, the Rules and Regu- 
lations within Part 19 should be altered at some later date 
so that the owner of class D equipment could only change 
tubes in the portions of the transceiver not common to 
both receiver and transmitter, or change fuses. The chang- 
ing of any other part, the altering of circuits, or any 
alignment and repair, other than receiver i.f. alignment, 
would have to be done by the holder of a Citizens Band 
Technician Class License. 
Equipment Certification 
In addition, each Citizens Band transceiver would have 
to be certified, at least once every year, for frequency 
tolerance, acceptable harmonic radiation, power output, 
and modulation of less than 100% by the holder of a Citi- 
zens Band Technician Class License. Such certification 
and all repair work would be entered on official FCC 
forms or facsimiles thereof, one copy of which would be 
given to the owner of the transceiver and the other kept 
by the licensed service technician or repair organization, 
subject to inspection by the FCC. 
It may seem that the author is suggesting even more 
stringent requirements for Part 19 than are now being im- 
posed. This is true. It is based, however, on the fact 
that most CB equipment is made in transceiver form, in 
which some circuits are common to both receiver and 
transmitter. While in some cases present regulations al- 
low the user to adjust or repair such common circuits. 
many of the problems with overmodulation and splatter- 
ing arise from just such repairs and alterations. In an 
effort to get just a little more from his transmitter, the 
user often fools around with the modulation circuits, sub- 
stituting hotter tubes or otherwise beefing up the circuit 
to the point where overmodulation takes place. Under 
present regulations he may be permitted to work on these 
circuits because they are basically audio circuits. How- 
ever, if a readily available repair organization were in 
existence, such alterations should not be permitted by 
the user. 
The author believes that such a special class of license 
could be easily obtained by the average TV -radio service 
technician, or by many knowledgeable CB -ers, after 
very little study. The additional equipment required by 
a TV -radio service shop would be relatively low in cost. 
TV -radio service technicians are already used to working 
on equipment of the average CB quality. In fact, in many 
cases, such men are better qualified to work on class D 
CB equipment than those who are used to working on 
equipment built to much higher technical standards. 
If licensing such as is proposed in this article were to 
become effective, it would go a long way towards elimi- 
nating the technical problems that beset class D Citizens 
Radio Service and would eliminate much of the irrespon- 
sible alterations and adjustments of equipment which are 
now being made under the excuse that no qualified repair 
service is available. Further, it could be implemented 
without putting an undue workload on the FCC. It would 
place responsibility for adequate maintenance upon duly 
licensed persons, and it would further place responsibility 
on the CB owner for periodic check -ups of his equip- 
ment.

sponse to at least 3.6 mc. and that it be able to sync well at 
the 3.58 -mc. color subcarrier frequency. Years ago a scope of 
this caliber was considered a laboratory instrument, however 
today it is within the financial reach of almost everyone. The 
choice of the color -pattern generator is not as easy to make. 
Several types are available and unless you are aware of the 
advantages and limitations of each, the decision can be diffi- 
cult. 
There are only two basically different color -pattern gen- 
erators -the NTSC -bar and the rainbow. Two different type 
rainbow generators are available -the continuous display and 
the gated rainbow. But before discussing them, let's talk about 
color TV transmission. 
NTSC Standards 
The NTSC 
( National Television Systems Committee) , 
which was formed in the early 50's, set up standards for the 
compatible color TV system. These standards were later 
adopted by the FCC and are in effect today. Although the 
design of color TV receivers may change over the years, it will 
always be such that color sets will be able to operate with an 
NTSC signal. 
A color picture is transmitted as a combination of bright- 
ness (Y) and color difference (R -Y and B -Y) signals. The Y 
component is transmitted as an AM signal, while the color in- 
formation (chroma) is a 3.58 -mc. phase -modulated signal 
with a suppressed carrier. Both Y and chroma are transmitted 
on the same channel. In order to produce a color at a specific 
hue and saturation, the chroma signal fed to a color demod- 
70 
110 
ulator circuit in the TV set must have a specific amplitude and 
60 
phase relationship with respect to the color burst signal. And, 
if the color is to have the correct brightness, there must always 
be a Y component in the signal. 
NTSC Color -Bar Generators 
160 
Fig. 2A shows the output waveform of an NTSC color -bar 
generator, a composite signal representing fully saturated 
170 
primary and complementary colors. To understand how this 
composite signal is formed, remember that it is made up of 
180 
two parts -a brightness, or Y component ( Fig. 2B) , and a 
90 
chrominance component ( Fig. 2C) . The chrominance com- 
ponent consists of a color burst and a series of six color bars 
200 
and white; white is at zero level. The color bars and burst, 
whose phase and amplitude relationships are shown in Fig. 1, 
210 
are produced by a common frequency of 3.58 mc. The burst is 
220 
the reference and therefore at 0° phase; yellow lags burst by 
13° with an amplitude of .44; red is next with a phase of 76° 
and amplitude of .63; magenta has a phase of 120° and an 
300 
240 
amplitude of .59; and so on.

It would exceed the scope of this article to describe in detail 
How NTSC -bar and rainbow -pattern genera- 
tors operate, are used to align color circuits, 
and points to bear in mind before buying. 
S\ LES of color -TV receivers are on the rise today for 
several good reasons: The sets are more reliable, they 
can be serviced easily in the home, and they do not 
require frequent readjustment -a far cry from the sets of a few 
years back. Programming time is increasing, and most of the 
leading manufacturers are now marketing receivers. This 
growth should convince the service technician that it is time 
to seriously "tool up" for color. 
If you own a color set and feel confident about making your 
own adjustments, you may have heard and wondered about 
color- pattern generators -how they work, what they can and 
are used to do, and which type -NTSC -bar or rainbow -would 
be best for making the various adjustments that are required 
in a color set. 
Basic equipment for black- and -white TV service includes 
a sweep and marker generator, a tube tester, a v.t.v.m., and 
an oscilloscope. Color TV service, in addition to this equip- 
ment, \vill require a wide -band scope and a color -pattern gen- 
erator. In the case of the scope the choice is not difficult to 
make. The requirement is that it have a flat frequency re-

the operation of an NTSC bar generator. However, we will 
describe the operation of the Hickok Model 656XC gener- 
ator, shown in block -diagram form in Fig. 3. 
How the NTSC Generator Works 
The color pattern must contain all the elements of an NTSC 
signal; that is, sync, chroma, and brightness information in 
con-ect phase. The color -bar phase differences are produced 
with precision delay lines; their amplitudes are determined by 
potentiometers. The brightness component of Fig. 2B is pro- 
duced by Schmitt trigger circuits with appropriate time delays 
for each bar. 
The heart of the generator is a timer which consists of five 
blocking oscillators (31.5 kc., 15,750 cps, 4500 cps, 900 cps, 
and 60 cps) that are electrically locked together and con- 
trolled by a 315 -kc. crystal -controlled oscillator. The block- 
ing- oscillator outputs, when combined, produce the compos- 
ite. 
The chroma component is generated by a 3.58 -mc. crystal 
oscillator. The output of the 3.58 -mc. oscillator is fed to a

cathode -follower stage which drives a delay line that has three 
output taps -one for each primary color 
( red, blue, and 
green) . The three output signals from the delay line, which 
are of different phase, are fed to three chroma gates. Another 
output of the 3.58 -mc. cathode -follower is fed to a burst gate. 
All gates are driven by 15,750 -cps pulses derived from another 
delay line and four multivibrators. The outputs of three of the 
multivibrators are fed through attenuators to form three Y, 
or brightness, signals in time sequence. All four signals, sync, 
chroma, Y, and burst are then added together in the composite 
adder -stage to produce the composite color -bar signal. This 
signal is fed to a cathode -follower stage for a low- impedance 
output. The complementary colors ( yellow, magenta, cyan ) 
and white are generated by overlapping the primary color 
bars. For example, when the green and red bars are added,

equals 1 (.3 +.59=- .11 =1). 
To generate the R -Y, B -Y, -G -Y, and G -Y at 90° 
alignment signals, as in Fig. 2E, rather than color bars, one 
primary color bar is switched off, the phase of the other bars 
is changed to "alignment signal phase," and the Y component 
is removed. The rest of the process is identical to that de- 
scribed for generating color bars. 
To generate a dot pattern, the 60 -cps and the 15,750 -cps 
pulses are fed to a sync -gate circuit. Here the composite sync 
signal is formed. The 900 -cps pulses and the 315 -kc. pulses 
are fed to a gate- dot -bar circuit, where the dot information is 
formed. To complete the composite signal, the dot informa- 
tion is added to the composite sync signal in the composite 
adder stage. The output of the composite adder is fed to the 
cathode -follower output stage and the output attenuator.

To produce a crosshatch pattern, the gate- dot -bar circuit 
is converted to an adder stage allowing the 900 -cps ( horizon- 
tal -bar frequency) and the 315 -kc. (vertical -bar frequency) 
to be fed to the output directly. Horizontal bars alone are 
produced by switching off the 315 -kc. signal in the crosshatch 
positions, and vice versa for vertical bars alone. 
In addition to the composite video output stage there is an 
r.f. oscillator that can be modulated by the composite signal 
so that color bar, dot bar, or alignment signals can be fed di- 
rectly to the antenna terminals of the color TV set through 
channels 2 -6. A sound -frequency crystal is also provided to 
facilitate fine tuning of the receiver. 
A less costly NTSC color generator (Model 661, Fig. 10) is 
also available. It differs from the generator just described in 
that it develops only one NTSC color (displayed on the entire 
CRT face) at a time. Each color is the correct brightness level, 
and in conformity with NTSC standards. Alignment signals of 
R - Y, B - Y, and G -Y at 90° are also available; these signals 
52 
are at black levels as shown in Fig. 4, lacking brightness (Y). 
In addition to the color signals, this generator also produces 
dot and crosshatch patterns, and vertical and horizontal bars. 
The crosshatch pattern consists of 20 vertical and 15 horizon- 
tal bars, less those in the blanking region. This is an aspect 
ratio of 4 to 3, ideal for height, width, and linearity adjust- 
ments. You merely make adjustments for perfect squares in 
all areas of the CRT screen. 
Alignment with an NTSC Generator 
Color demodulator alignment with an NTSC generator is 
relatively simple. On sets that demodulate in quadrature, that 
is, the type with R -Y, B -Y demodulators, a scope with a 
low- capacity probe is connected to the output of the R- Y de- 
modulator. A B -Y signal is fed to the set. Then, with the hue 
control set to mid- position, the R -Y phase is adjusted for a 
null or zero output of the B -Y signal. The scope is then con- 
nected to the plate or output of the B -Y demodulator and an 
R -Y signal is fed into the set. The quadrature phase is ad- 
justed for a null or zero output of the R -Y signal. Normally 
this completes the demodulator alignment since most receiv- 
ers use a fixed matrix for G -Y and do not require adjustment. 
However, if a G -Y adjustment is required, the scope is con- 
nected to the G -Y output. A G -Y signal at 90° is fed to the 
set and an adjustment is made for a null or zero output. 
On color sets that demodulate out of quadrature, that is 
sets with the so- called X and Z demodulators, alignment is 
also simple. Instead of connecting the oscilloscope to the 
demodulators, it is connected to the R - Y, B -- Y, and G -Y 
outputs which are located at the grids of the CRT. The pro- 
cedure then is identical to that for quadrature demodulators. 
Rainbow Generators 
Many service technicians might shy away from an NTSC 
color -bar generator because of the high cost, and especially 
when just starting to do color work. If they are willing to sac- 
rifice some performance and versatility for a saving in price, 
then the rainbow generator should be their choice. Later, as 
color service business increases and more complicated work 
is considered, an NTSC generator could be purchased. The 
rainbow generator could be used for installation and service 
in the home while the NTSC generator is used for bench work 
where an accurate standard signal source is required.

PHOTOGRAPHY IN INllUSTRY 
By RAY A. SHIVER / 
Instrumentation Laboratory, AirResearch Mfg. Co. of Arizona 
Description of cameras and techniques used to make a record of scope patterns 
-particularly those that are non -repetitive or too rapid for direct viewing. 
THE VALUE of the modern laboratory oscilloscope as 
a measuring instrument is well known to most engi- 
neers and technicians. However, the instruments avail- 
able to photograph cathode -ray oscilloscope traces and the 
techniques required to use them properly are probably not so 
well known. Some type of photographic record is very often 
desirable, or may be absolutely necessary in some cases, if 
the signal to be measured requires an extremely fast time 
base and is non- repetitive in character. Any type of signal 
that can be displayed on a CRO can also be photographed 
if the appropriate camera and film combination is used. 
Oscilloscope Cameras 
Conventional cameras can be used, of course, to photo- 
graph oscilloscope traces if a suitable lens and shutter corn- 
bination is used and some sort of light -tight enclosure is pro- 
vided. The disadvantage in this case is that the film must first 
be developed before the results are known. This can be a 
time -consuming process and, in addition, one cannot be abso- 
lutely certain of the results until the negative or print is avail- 
able for inspection. For these reasons most commercial cam- 
eras available for photographing CRO traces employ a 
Polaroid Landll back. For certain applications, high -speed 
35- millimeter strip cameras are also used. 
Cameras employing Polaroid backs offer many advan- 
tages, the most important of which are: First, the finished 
print is available for almost immediate inspection ( 10 seconds 
for film types 47 and 410) which permits a shot to be retaken 
immediately if for some reason the first is not satisfactory. 
Second, finished prints can be made on paper (types 42, 47, 
and 410) or on positive transparencies (types 46 or 46 -L) . 
Positive transparencies can be projected in conventional 
slide projectors, or they can be blown up for enlarged 
prints. And finally, Polaroid films are available with a wide

range of speeds from an ASA rating of 200 for type 42 up to 
a rating of 10,000 for type 410. This permits a wide range 
of data to be photographed from steady -state signals up to 
extremely fast transients. 
Three oscilloscope cameras, employing Polaroid backs, 
that are representative of the types available for this work 
are shown in the photos. Note that in each case the camera 
back is mounted differently with respect to the screen of 
the cathode -ray tube. This is an important characteristic of 
each type of camera and determines the form the final print 
will take, as well as the construction of the viewing system 
used. 
Fig. 1 illustrates the picture -image path and the viewing 
system for the DuMont Model 302 camera shown in the 
photograph. Note the dichroic or beam -splitting mirror that 
intersects the primary image path. This is actually a yellow 
filter which diverts most of the highly photographic blue 
light to the camera while permitting some of the less efficient 
yellow and green to pass through for viewing purposes. For 
this reason this type of camera works best with a CRT em- 
ploying a blue -light phosphor, such as type P -11. 
Use of the beam -splitting mirror permits direct or head -on 
viewing of the CRO screen, which can be a big advantage 
when adjusting the gain of the scope to precise calibrate sig- 
nals. One disadvantage, however, is the image reversal caused 
by the mirror action of the beam splitter. This causes the final 
print to be a reversed image of the CRO trace. As long as 
one remembers the correct relationship of the final print to 
the original trace, there is no particular problem, although 
photographs taken on instruments with calibrated screens, 
such as spectrum analyzers, will show all calibration figures 
in reverse order. When using Polaroid type 46 or 46 -L film, 
which produces positive transparencies, this situation can be 
corrected by simply viewing or projecting the transparency 
from the reverse side. 
The Model 302 camera produces a final image that is con- 
siderably smaller than the CRO screen. This permits two 
full exposures to be made for each frame, as illustrated in 
Fig. 3. If it is not necessary to expose the graticule each time, 
several traces can be recorded on each frame, as shown in 
Fig. 4. Where practical, this method can produce a con- 
siderable saving in film. A movable back and slide track are 
provided on this model which permits advancing a frame 
a portion at a time for the desired spacing. A graduated scale 
indicates the position of the back with respect to the frame 
length. 
A camera designed to produce a full -size reproduction of 
the CRO screen is the Beattie -Coleman Model 12445 shown 
in the photo. Note that the camera back is mounted in such

a way as to allow the full 10 -cm. scale of the graticule X axis 
(horizontal) to be photographed. Slightly over 8 cm. of the 
Y axis (vertical) will be covered using standard 3% x 4)4 
Polaroid film. Paper prints produced in this manner have an 
advantage in that they are more easily read because of the 
larger trace size. Also, a centimeter rule can be applied di- 
rectly to the print for measuring trace dimensions. Positive 
transparencies can be used to produce full -size contact prints. 
As in the previous example, a beam- splitting yellow filter 
is used to divide the light from the scope trace into two parts, 
one for photography and the other for viewing purposes. An 
added feature of this particular model is the ability to rotate 
the camera back 90 degrees in the same plane, if desired. 
This permits moving the back along the Y axis for recording 
multiple trace exposures on the same frame. On a 1:1 repro- 
duction ratio, the graticule can be pre- exposed before the 
camera back is moved in order to provide reference lines for 
multiple exposures. 
An example of a CRO camera that does not produce a 
reversed photo print is shown in the photo above. Note that 
the camera back now occupies the position of the binocular 
viewer found in the beam -splitting type. This particular 
model is a Fairchild F -286 and it provides non -reversed prints 
with an image reduction ratio of 2:1. This permits two ex- 
posures of the CRO screen for each frame. The image path 
is shown in Fig. 2. Since the viewing port is offset from the 
straight -line path to the CRT face, some parallax is intro- 
duced due to the spacing between the tube face and the 
graticule. This may make precise calibration of the oscillo-

Fig. 2. In this system, no beam -splitting mirror is used so 
scope difficult with the camera in place. However, for ordi- 
nary viewing purposes this offers little or no disadvantage. 
The camera back and lens assembly are mounted on a spring - 
loaded hinge arrangement that permits the camera to be 
positioned for two exposures per frame. 
Lens and Shutter System 
Most CRO cameras made by American manufacturers em- 
ploy a 75 -mm. f /2.8 or f /1.9 lens. This is generally coupled 
with a shutter having speeds up to 1/100 second as well as 
"time" and "bulb." The shutter is usually operated with a 
cable release external to the camera. Accessibility to the 
lens and shutter settings is provided for in several ways, de- 
pending on the make and model of the camera. The camera 
of the DuMont unit shown provides access through the small 
trap door visible in the photograph. Two thumb screws lo- 
cated on the bottom of the camera in the Beattie unit permit 
the back to be removed from the periscope for lens and 
shutter adjustment. A ring and detent assembly located on 
the front of the camera in the Fairchild unit allows the cam-

era to be completely removed from the barrel if required. 
It is not meant to suggest that the cameras described are 
the only models offered by a particular manufacturer. As a 
general rule, CRO camera manufacturers offer several differ- 
ent models with a choice as to camera orientation, lens and 
shutter accessibility, and other features. 
Exposing the Film 
Camera lens and shutter settings are dependent on the type 
of trace to be photographed, the type of film used, and the 
level of the CRO beam intensity. There are no hard and fast 
rules since often the same end result can be obtained with 
several different combinations of lens, shutter, and beam 
intensity settings. Generally the lower the beam intensity 
setting and the smaller the aperture size, the sharper the 
trace will be in the reproduction. When photographing 
steady -state data (where a stationary trace can be displayed), 
one of the faster shutter speeds can be used. This is illustrated 
by Figs. 5 and 6. The object in this example is to photograph 
five cycles of a 100 -cps sine -wave signal.

Since the sweep system of most laboratory -type oscillo- 
scopes is calibrated in unit time per centimeter it is con- 
venient to first convert 100 cps to a function of unit time. 
Time (in seconds) = 1 /freq. (cps) = 1/100 or .01 second 
(10 msec.) . To display one complete cycle the CRO sweep 
would have to equal the time of the displayed signal, or in 
this case 1 msec. /cm., which gives a total time of 10 msec. for 
a 10 -cm. scale. Since we wish to display five complete cycles 
of the 100 -cps signal, the CRO sweep time would have to be 
five times the length of one cycle of the frequency to be 
displayed, or 5 msec. /cm. It is helpful to think of the shutter 
speeds in the same units of time as the oscilloscope sweep 
system, 1 /100 sec. being 10 msec., 1 /50 sec. as 20 msec., etc. 
It then becomes quite easy to determine how many complete 
sweep cycles will occur during the time the camera shutter 
is open for a particular setting of sweep and shutter time. 
Fig. 5 shows the result of photographing 5 cycles of a 100 - 
cps signal using a shutter speed of 40 msec. (1 /25 sec.) . 
Since we have determined it takes 50 msec. for one complete 
sweep cycle, we have only succeeded in photographing 4/5 
of one sweep, or 4 cycles. A good rule -of -thumb is to choose 
a shutter speed that will give at least two complete sweeps of 
the CRO trace. In this example a shutter speed of 100 msec. 
(1 /10 sec.) will capture two complete sweeps as shown in 
Fig. 6. 
The preceding example was used to show the time rela- 
tionships among a specific frequency, horizontal sweep time, 
and camera shutter speed. In actual practice, for displaying 
steady -state signals the sweep frequency is generally ad- 
justed until the desired pattern is obtained on the CRO 
screen and the time base may be incidental. However, if a 
picture is desired, a quick glance at the sweep rate will allow 
one to calculate mentally a shutter speed that will permit 
photographing two or more sweeps. 
Often a signal to be photographed may contain several 
frequency components which makes it difficult to produce 
a satisfactory picture at normal shutter speeds. This is illus- 
trated by the example in Fig. 7. The picture shown is a 
square wave being modulated by a 60 -cps sine wave. This 
caused the trace to jitter badly and produced the results 
shown. Much better definition can be secured by setting the 
shutter to "bulb" and manually holding it open while trig- 
gering only one sweep of the signal. Note the much finer 
detail of Fig. 8 when this technique was used. Most labora- 
tory -type oscilloscopes have a gated sweep system necessary 
to produce this type of photography. By adjusting the gate 
trigger level, one sweep of the trace can be initiated by 
means of an internal, manually operated push- button, or by 
an external trigger voltage. 
Photographs of this type require a larger aperture opening, 
more beam intensity, or perhaps both -depending on the 
sweep rate used. This is necessary since a triggered sweep, 
when adjusted properly, only permits one pass of the trace 
which cuts down the exposure time proportionately. For 
56 
Fig. 7. (Far left). Square wave modulated by 
60 -cps sine wave produces 
these unsatis- 
factory results using 
a recurrent sweep. 
Fig. 8. When a single triggered sweep 
is 
used and the camera shutter is set to "bulb," 
resultant photo is far more satisfactory.

transient signals that occur at random.

transient signals requiring extremely fast sweep rates, gen-

Several methods can be used to increase the "writing 
speed" of films. Writing speed is a term used to more ac- 
curately describe the photographic efficiency of film used for 
CRO photography. It is usually designated as the maximum 
CRT beam sweep rate in cm. per µsec. that will produce a 
readable trace on the photograph. Pre -fogging the film or 
decreasing the developing time will substantially increase 
the writing speed. A combination of the two can increase the 
maximum writing speed by as much as three times. 
Pre -fogging is accomplished by pre- exposing the film to a 
controlled light source. The amount of illumination and ex- 
posure required for optimum pre -fogging of a particular film 
type can best be determined by experiment. Generally the 
optimum point is reached when a fully developed print back- 
ground changes from a normal black to a lighter gray. 
An underdeveloped print is one that has been removed 
from the camera prior to normal development time. This is 
the simplest method for increasing maximum writing speed. 
As the developing time is decreased, the normal dark back- 
ground of a fully developed print will change to progressively 
lighter shades of gray. Contrast is correspondingly reduced 
but finer detail will be visible which otherwise would not be 
apparent. 
Some oscilloscopes do not provide sufficient graticule 
lighting to give good reproduction using a fast shutter speed 
and one of the slower speed films. If this is the case, a good 
reproduction of the graticule can be obtained by operating 
the shutter several times with the beam intensity turned off. 
This permits adequate exposure of the graticule before the 
trace is photographed. 
The shutter "time" position is valuable for taking photo -

MAC' 
ELECTRONICS 
SERVICE 
By JOHN T. FRYE 
The Caduceus & the Electron 
MAC entered the door of his service shop for the first 
time in a month. Gall stones impacted in his com- 
mon bile duct and producing jaundice had made 
quick surgery imperative, and he had spent twenty -three days 
in the hospital and several more days recuperating at home. 
Now he was back on his feet, although moving a little more 
slowly and carefully than usual. 
The welcoming smiles of Matilda, the office girl, and Bar- 
ney, Mac's right hand, warmed the owner of the shop. "Wel- 
come back, Boss; you look great!" Barney lied, ignoring Mac's 
pale face and his loss of at least twenty pounds. 
"We're certainly glad to have you back," Matilda said as 
she took off her glasses and dabbed at her eyes with a wisp of 
a handkerchief. 
"I'm glad to be back, too," Mac said with convincing sin- 
cerity; "but I'm warning you both: the first one who makes a 
crack about always knowing I had too much gall is automat- 
ically fired. I've had about all of that witty remark I can take. 
But come on, Barney; let's go back into the service depart- 
ment. These lily -white hands of mine are literally aching to 
wrap themselves around some tools. I used to lie in bed and 
think about how good it was going to be to feel the solid heft 
of a solder gun in my hand again or to be gripping a screw- 
driver handle while my muscles tensed against the resistance 
of a stubborn screw. Believe me: work is a blessing. If you've 
any doubts, a few days of enforced idleness in a hospital bed 
will make a believer of you." 
Mac was running his fingers lovingly over the bezel of the 
oscilloscope as he talked, and Barney noticed his fingers had 
picked up a smudge of dust. The youth tossed a clean cloth 
to his employer. 
"No, thanks," Mac said with a faint grin. "I told the nurses 
the first thing I intended to do when I escaped from their 
clutches was to get good and dirty. They scrub you within an 
inch of your life, and everything about you is kept antisep- 
tically clean. When washing, you have to remember where 
you left off so you will know where to start, for you certainly 
can't tell by looking. It sounds wacky, but a little honest dirt 
on these mechanic's hands is going to look good to me." 
"Well, you had a long vacation from electronics anyway. I 
noticed you didn't even have a radio or TV set there in the 
room." 
"That's true. I spent my spare time reading thoroughly the 
trade magazines I usually just skim through looking for some- 
thing of immediate application to our work; and I was amazed 
at how much interesting and eventually useful information I 
had been glossing over. I made a resolution to take time to 
read these magazines more carefully from now on, especially 
those forward- looking articles that try to prepare us for prob- 
lems we'll meet in the future and to keep us abreast of what's 
going on in adjacent electronic fields." 
58 
"I'll bet you missed having someone to talk shop with." 
"Oddly enough I had someone. The radiologist at the hos- 
pital, a Dr. Beam, is an acquaintance of mine interested in 
electronics; and when he found out I was a patient, he came 
down to the room and brought some medical magazines that 
had articles in them on electronic instruments used in diag- 
nosis and treatment. These really opened my eyes as to the 
part electronics is playing in medicine these days and the 
more important part it is undoubtedly going to play in the 
future." 
"You mean like the x -ray, the electrocardiograph, and the 
electroencephalograph ?" 
"Not necessarily, although those instruments have cer- 
tainly blazed the trail. Incidentally, speaking of the electro- 
cardiograph, Dr. Beam was telling me about the remote -indi- 
cating electrocardiograph now in use. The patient wears a 
miniature transmitter that's modulated by signals picked up 
by the electrodes fastened to his body. The transmitted signal 
radiates several hundred feet into a receiver feeding the re- 
cording mechanism. The patient can run up and down the 
hall, climb stairs, do gymnastics, or even drive a car without 
the restricting encumbrance of connecting wires while a con- 
tinuous record is made of his heart's action. 
"A related instrument monitors continuously the pulse, res- 
piration, temperature, and blood pressure of a seriously ill 
patient; and any one of these factors can be instantly exam- 
ined at a remote console that will handle sixteen patients at a 
time. Furthermore, if any one of the conditions being moni- 
tored exceeds preset limits, an alarm sounds at the console." 
"That should help the trained nurse shortage." 
"Right. Some of the other things Dr. Beam and the maga- 
zines mentioned were more exotic. One was a pressure- sensi- 
tive paint. The resistance of this paint changes as pressure is 
applied to it. A tiny speck of the paint in the end of a catheter 
with leads coming from it can measure the variation in pres- 
sure inside the heart itself." 
"Don't forget the pacemaker that keeps an erratic and 
feeble heart beating regularly with carefully timed electric 
pulses." 
"I was getting around to that, but it reminds me of another 
use of electronics in connection with the heart I found par- 
ticularly fascinating. We both learned in safety classes that 
one of the greatest dangers in electric shock -even compara- 
tively weak shock -is that the heart will start ventricular 
fibrillation. When that happens, the heart's timing system 
goes haywire and the lower chambers of the heart just flutter 
feebly without pumping any blood. Either the heart is per- 
suaded to pick up its beat quickly or the owner dies. 
"In the past a low -voltage shock of a.c. current has been 
used to start the heart beating again, but sometimes this works 
and sometimes it doesn't. A few months back Dr. Morris J. 
Levy of the University of Minnesota and Surgeon C. Walton 
Lillehei discovered that a high -voltage d.c. `defibrillator' was 
much more dependable. In fact, it is so dependable that they 
deliberately subject heart surgery patients to fibrillation and 
then start the heart beating again when the operation is over. 
"The reason they do this is that it is very difficult to operate 
on a heart when it is pumping away. After all, there is no need 
for it to be pumping, for its work is taken over by a heart -lung 
machine that circulates the blood and chills it. The heart is 
set into fibrillation with a low- voltage current and is left in 
that comparatively quiet state during the entire operation, 
which in one case lasted two and a quarter hours. At the end 
of the operation, a d.c. shock up to 7000 volts but lasting only 
a twenty -fifth of a second restores the heart beat. In at least 
two cases, the d.c. machine started the heart beating again 
when the electrodes were simply applied to the skin. That 
makes me think we may soon see one of these machines going 
right along with the inhalator on emergency calls." 
"One thing that bugs me," Barney remarked, "is how quick- 
ly electronic developments are put to medical use. I'm think-

Here it is, the scope that technicians, engineers and service- 
men from coast to coast have been demanding. A portable 
wide band scope that can be used on the job anywhere, yet 
has the highest laboratory specifications for shop or lab. 
Cumbersome color TV sets, remote audio and organ install- 
ations and computers are just a few of the jobs that make 
owning a scope of this type so essential. Why consider a 
narrow band scope, when for only a few dollars more, this 
professional wide band sensitive scope equips you for any job. 
The PS120 provides features never before offered. Only 
two major controls make the PS120 as easy to use as a volt- 
meter. Even its smart good looks were designed for functional 
efficiency. New forward thrust design, creating its own 
shadow mask, and full width calibrated graph increase 
sharpness of wave form patterns. A permanent chromed

Electrical specifications and operational ease will surpass 
your fondest expectations. Imagine a wide band scope that 
accurately reproduces any waveform from 20 cycles to 12 
megacycles. And the PS120 is as sensitive as narrow band 
scopes . . all the way. Vertical amplifier sensitivity is .035 
volts RMS. The PS120 has no narrow band positions which 
cause other scopes to register erroneous waveforms unexpect- 
edly. Another Sencore first is the Automatic Range Indi- 
cation on Vertical Input Control which enables the direct 
reading of peak -to -peak voltages. Simply adjust to one inch 
height and read P -to -P volts present. Standby position 
on power switch, another first, adds hours of life to CRT 
and other tubes. A sensitive wide band oscilloscope like the 
PS120 has become an absolute necessity for trouble shooting 
Color TV and other modern circuits and no other scope is as 
fast or easy to use.

ing about that article on lasers that 
appeared in the December, 1962 issue 
of ELECTRONICS WORLD. According to it, 
lasers were only developed about the 
middle of 1960; yet before the end of 
1962 they had already been used to burn 
tumors from the back of the eye of a 
human being and to weld detached ret- 
inas in rabbits. Probably by now their 
sharply focussed, intensely hot beams 
are being used as a sort of electronic 
scalpel and for cauterization. Someone 
must really be hustling things from the 
laboratory to the operating room." 
"Dr. Beam and I talked about that. He 
thinks the medical field presents a won- 
derful opportunity for the serious, 
young, top -flight electronics technician. 
You see the field of medicine and the 
field of electronics are each too big for 
a single human being to master both; yet 
a deep knowledge of both fields is neces- 
sary for worthwhile medical electronics 
development. That's why Dr. Beam says 
the greatest success is being made by 
teams composed of a doctor -often a spe- 
cialist -and an electronics technician or 
engineer. The doctor outlines what is 
needed; the technician builds up the 
hardware to supply the need. Working 
together, they test the equipment, iron 
out difficulties, and refine it until it has 
the necessary safety and reliability." 
Mac paused a bit and then went on 
with a grin: "I must admit I was a flat 
failure at helping Dr. Beam with the 
electronic problem he handed me. He 
and Dr. Klever, who reads the electro- 
cardiographs at the hospital, are good 
friends and often attend medical meet- 
ings together. Dr. Klever is a fine wood 
worker, and he built up a little portable 
lectern with a speaker in the front, an 
amplifier inside, and a microphone on a 
flexible gooseneck coming out the top. 
The idea was to place this on the table 
in front of the doctor speaking so that his 
remarks would be amplified and easily 
heard by the others present. See any- 
thing wrong with the idea ?" 
"Feedback," Barney answered. 
"Right. The speaker and microphone 
are simply too close together for appre- 
ciable gain to be obtained without howl- 
ing. Dr. Beam thought there ought to be 
some way of getting around this because 
electronic megaphones have their speak- 
ers and microphones close together." 
"Yeah, but the speaker and micro- 
phone used in those jobs are both of spe- 
cial highly directional types, the fre- 
quency range is restricted, and the over- 
all gain is comparatively low because 
you shout directly into the mike. A sen- 
sitive mike feeding into a high -gain, full - 
range amplifier driving a non- directional 
speaker is a horse of another hue. He 
had better just use a couple of small 
portable outboard speakers he can place 
some distance from the mike." 
"That's what I suggested -hey, what 
are you drawing ?" 
"Oh I'm just working out the insignia 
I'll be wearing when I'm a successful 
medical electronics technician," Barney 
said jokingly. "This winged staff with 
the two snakes twined about it is the ca- 
duceus, one of the symbols of a physi- 
cian. As you can see, I'm just sketching 
in an electron symbol whirling around 
the wings and the snake heads. Pretty 
sharp, huh ?" 
"Not bad, and in all seriousness you 
could do a lot worse than think about a 
career in that field. It has rewards 
greater than money. In this shop we get 
a lot of satisfaction out of knowing that 
we are helping to keep people enter- 
tained and well informed; but to know 
that through your work people were be- 
ing kept alive and healthy -well that 
would provide real satisfaction. 
INTERFERENCE MYSTERY 
By ROY JESSE 
AN EXPERIENCE with the author's 
own TV set parallels a common 
service embarrassment. Shortly after a 
repair, the family complained, "You 
didn't fix this thing!" Sure enough, 
there were occasional bending, light 
flashes, and what seemed like sound 
bars. Such symptoms are induced by 
poor contact somewhere in the antenna 
system, but only one of three stations 
received, channel 4, was affected. Since 
the source seemed to be at a specific fre- 
quency, suspicion fell on two local hams. 
Possible transmission troubles were 
ruled out by a call to the station engi- 
neer. Several tricks were tried in vain to 
recognize the voice or otherwise identify 
the source. I asked my wife to report at 
what times during the day interference 
occurred and dropped the matter. 
There were no effects in the daytime, 
but the symptoms returned that night - 
when the amateurs were active. Evidence 
was too circumstantial for a direct com- 
plaint, but this seemed like the right 
track. A week later, however, the inter- 
ference showed up during the daytime. 
A check with neighbors showed the prob- 
lem wasn't widespread. This turned me 
back to my_ own installation. 
On an evening when there were no 
symptoms, shaking the transmission line 
to my conical antenna induced them. No 
defects could he found in the wire. I 
shook the antenna itself. Interference 
was pronounced. I then noted that one 
of the reflector bars had moved some- 
what out of position, through the hole in 
its support bracket. The set screw hold- 
ing it had cone loose, permitting the 
element to vibrate -when the wind was 
strong enough, day or night. 
After the bar was repositioned and the 
screw tightened, the problem vanished. 
I won't try to explain why the mechanical 
fault affected one channel only. There 
are more important lessons from this in- 
cident. When we are stumped, we look 
for a scapegoat, and the maligned ama- 
teur is still the most convenient victim. 
Also, as long as there will be baffling de- 
fects that do not fall into customary cate- 
gories, we must keep an open mind in- 
stead of jumping to hasty conclusions. A

Bionic Computers 
(Continued from page 28 ) 
In 1960 the Air Force called a con- 
ference, coined the term "bionics" to de- 
scribe what the meeting would be about. 
(The word doesn't come from a combi- 
nation of biology and electronics as has 
been frequently reported, but from the 
Greek word "bion," which means "unit 
of life. ") To everyone's surprise, more 
than 700 scientists showed up, pre- 
sented dozens of papers reporting on 
work they had done. 
Bionic Pilots 
Intensive investigation has been un- 
derway in scores of company and uni- 
versity laboratories ever since. The Air 
Force is particularly interested in the 
field, hopes eventually to have such ad- 
vanced devices as bionic pilots. "Air- 
planes," said one officer, "are getting too 
fast and too complicated for men to 
handle. If two 1500 -mph jets come out 
of clouds 10 miles apart on collision 
course, they'll smash into each other 
before the pilots have a chance to react 
and change course." 
The effectiveness of a future bionic 
pilot was demonstrated in an experiment 
performed by Melpar under an Air Force 
contract. During major overhauls, the 
ailerons of an airplane are sometimes 
wired up backwards. When the pilot 
takes off and a wing dips, he automat- 
ically tries to correct it. But with the 
mis -wired aileron, his action makes the 
dip worse instead of correcting it. "I've 
never known a pilot to fly out of such 
a situation alive," said one observer. 
Melpar simulated the same situation 
on a computer, found that a bionic brain 
would react so fast that it would realize 
what was wrong and retrain itself to ap- 
ply the proper kind of corrective action 
before a dangerous situation could de- 
velop. 
Bionic brains, if they live up to prom- 
ise, seem perfectly suited for thousands 
of jobs where the ability to assimilate 
volumes of information, sift out the rele- 
vant, and make logical decisions, is im- 
portant. Weather forecasting, language 
translation, predicting business trends: 
all are possible examples. 
No Unanimity 
As is usually the case in areas of new 
discovery, opinions of leaders in the field 
are sharply divided as to the possible 
future benefits to be gained from bionic 
computing devices. L. D. Harmon of Bell 
Labs, who has done much of the trail- 
blazing work in artificial neurons, feels 
that in general predictions tend to take 
too rosy a view. Living brain systems, 
says Harmon, are so complex that we 
may never be able to understand them 
completely -let alone build machines to 
imitate them. What is needed now is a

more basic knowledge of such dimly 
understood attributes as thought, intel- 
ligence, and reasoning ability. 
Dr. Arthur Samuel of IBM tends to 
agree that although some progress may 
come out of bionic research, probably 
the best way to advance toward machine 
intelligence is to delve more deeply into 
the basic mechanism of thought. "To call 
to mind a rather trite analogy," he says, 
"when man first attempted to fly, he 
studied the birds, and the early, unsuc- 
cessful flying machines were mechanical 
birds. It was not until man stopped 
studying birds and began to study aero- 
dynamics that much progress was made. 
The modern jet airplane," he continues, 
"must cope with the same aerodynam- 
ical problems with which birds contend, 
but the mechanisms used in the solution 
of the problem of flight are quite dif- 
ferent." 
Dr. Samuel believes that if and when 
man really understands what thought is, 
he'll probably be able to build machines 
or even program conventional comput- 
ers to think. Further, the process may 
imitate the precise functions of the brain 
about as accurately as a Boeing 707 imi- 
tates a seagull. Fastest progress, he feels, 
will probably come from research aimed 
at basic understanding of thought proc- 
esses and intelligence, rather than from 
attempts to imitate the brain. 
At the same time, Samuel and many 
others who take the same general view, 
believe that no promising approach to 
the problem should be neglected, and 
that the field of bionics, particularly in 
view of its early accomplishments, is a 
worthwhile line of investigation. 
Others are more enthusiastic. Gordon 
Pask, for example, of System Research, 
Ltd. of Richmond, England, envisions 
future bionic brains in almost human 
terms. "A biological computer would be 
capable of elaborating concepts we 
could understand. We might argue with 
it and lead it to modify its attitude. I 
intend these remarks," he added for 
skeptics, "quite literally." 
Even the fact that little actual bionic 
computing hardware now exists doesn't 
dampen the enthusiasm of some bionic 
boosters. "Bionics," said former RCA 
President John H. Burns, summing up 
his feelings with no equivocation, "holds 
more promise for human benefit than 
any temporal force at work in our civil- 
ization today."

Transistorized Amplifier 
(Continued from page 47) 
can be made to the collector of Q7 by 
fastening a solder lug to one of its 
mounting screws with a second nut. 
The use of a printed circuit simplifies 
construction considerably. The bases of 
Q1 to Q4 are internally connected to 
their cases hence the cases of these 
transistors must not be allowed to make 
any electrical contact. The ground con- 
nections are laid out to eliminate ground 
loops and should not be changed with- 
out keeping this in mind. 
For the utmost in power output, ad- 
just the value of R2 for symmetrical 
clipping with the load impedance you 
will be using. 
Using the Amplifier 
As with any electronic equipment, 
there are a few operating precautions 
which should be observed. This ampli- 
fier is not intended for steady, near - 
maximum output. Under such condi- 
tions it can overheat. The amplifier 
should not be operated in ambient tem- 
peratures much higher than room tem- 
perature. On the other hand, one need 
never worry about its being turned too 
loud when listening to program material 
and when operating the amplifier near 
normal temperatures. 
As mentioned before, the output im- 
pedance is very low. Therefore, never 
short the output terminals because this 
will draw excessive current which will, 
in all probability, damage some of the 
transistors. The minimum permissible 
load value is approximately 3.2 ohms 
which is the lowest commonly encoun- 
tered speaker impedance. The higher 
the load impedance, the easier it is on 
the amplifier. However, 8 ohms is about 
the best load value because at 16 ohms 
the power begins to drop off. In contrast 
to some transformer -output amplifiers, 
leaving the output open will not harm 
the amplifier. The performance of the 
amplifier insofar as power response and 
harmonic distortion are concerned is 
illustrated in Fig. 2. 
This amplifier will not tolerate capaci- 
tive loads. More than .01 cf. will cause 
oscillation which, 
if continued, will 
cause transistor damage. More than .1 
ftf. will be likely to damage some tran- 
sistors instantly. 
The amplifier should lend itself to 
portable battery operation but 24 volts 
d.c. is the maximum permissible operat- 
ing voltage. Operation at as low as 6 
volts is possible, but with a correspond- 
ing drop in maximum power output. 
Sensitivity is good -.4 volt is sufficient 
to drive the amplifier to full output. In- 
put impedance is moderately high - 
above 15,000 ohms. This is adequate for 
most signal sources.

the recording itself, and sound qualities. 
Poor recordings, off -beat and lo_al rec-

This is a joint contribution by five 
Bell Laboratories' engineers who de- 
scribe the principles of communication 
for the benefit of laymen in non -technical 
terms. Since their background is in the 
telephone field, most of the examples in 
this book are based on telephony but 
since Bell has pioneered many of the in-

the material is highly pertinent. 
The text consists of fifteen chapters 
covering such subjects as speech com- 
munication, modulation theory, pulse 
modulation multiplex, transmission me- 
dia, amplification and signal generation, 
transmission systems, trunking and 
switching central office control, commu-

Repair and maintenance of marine electronic equip- 
ment differs from servicing all other types of elec- 
tronic gear. Its installation and repair cannot safely 
be undertaken without certain knowledge. This book 
provides anyone with a basic foundation in radio 
with the special knowledge required to service 
marine electronic gear. What's more, the technically 
minded boat -owner can acquire the know -how to 
keep his electronic equipment in top operating con- 
dition. Here are 18 points, essential to servicing 
marine equipment properly, made absolutely clear 
and understandable in this book. 1. Technical and 
license requirements for technicians. 2. The instru- 
ments and tools - how they are used, FCC regula- 
tions and standards. 3. The electrical systems of 
boats - requirements for connecting electronic 
equipment to attain maximum efficiency and pre- 
vent possible damage. 4. Radiotelephone circuits in- 
cluding: receiver, transmitter, modulator and power 
supply, transistorized portions. 5. Powerboat an- 
tenna and ground problems, their solutions. Mechan- 
ical and electrical requirements for their installation 
and service. 6. Installation of efficient antennas on 
sailboats - rigging procedure. 7. Practical tips of 
radiotelephone installation - power, antenna and 
ground wiring, troubleshooting. 8. Preliminary and 
on- the -job tuning of the radiotelephone transmitter, 
receiver and antenna circuits. 9. Radio direction 
finders from portable transistorized band operated 
units to automatic direction finders - their cir- 
cuitry. 10. Installating and calibrating radio direc- 
tion finders. 11. Echo sounders - principles and 
construction - how to install the equipment and 
transducers; testing, maintenance. 12. Automatic 
steering devices (pilots) - electronic and electrical. 
13. Small -craft radars - theory and construction 
with data on special components (magnetrons and 
klystrons) ; 
installation. 
14. Loran receivers - 
theory, elements, installation. 15. Electrical inter- 
ference- sources, and how to reduce or eliminate 
them. 16. Electrolysis or galvanic corrosion - how 
to prevent it. 17. Protecting equipment. the twat, 
the personnel from lightning. 18. Console and Con - 
solan navigation receivers - their characteristics.

IN ORDER for the ham to get anywhere in 
today's crowded amateur bands, he needs 
either a large handful of crystals or else a v.f.o. 
The Eico Model 722 v.f.o., which we have just 
constructed and tested, will permit the ham to 
squeeze into a clear spot on any of the five bands 
from 80 to 10 meters. The 5- inch -long, clearly 
marked dial makes it very easy to put the rig 
at any frequency chosen. One big problem with 
v.f.o.'s is to get as close as possible to the crystal - 
controlled rig in stability. By using excellent me- 
chanical and electrical design, this v.f.o. achieves 
this kind of stability. At the same time, the unit 
has a high enough output so that it con easily 
drive just about any modern transmitter. 
The oscillator is a series -tuned Clapp e.c.o. 
using a large slug -tuned coil and temperature - 
compensating capacitors to prevent drift. A high 
LC ratio for the tank keeps circulating current low 
and minimizes heating and losses. The main tun- 
ing capacitor uses double bearings for good 
mechanical stability to prevent frequency shift.

Also, a voltage -regulated oscillator screen supply 
keeps this important voltage constant in spite 
of line- voltage changes. Finally, extra shielding 
around the oscillator circuits prevents hand capa- 
city, outside 
mechanical movements, and heat 
from affecting the operating frequency. The os- 
cillator operates on 80 meters at all positions of 
the bondswitch. 
Output from the oscillator is then fed to o 
buffer -multiplier. This stage serves to isolate the 
oscillator from the transmitter being driven. When 
the v.f.o. is set for 80 meters, the buffer is a 
straight- through amplifier. On all other bands the 
buffer is tuned to the second harmonic of the 
oscillator and calibrated output is available on 
40 meters and, by use of harmonics, on 20, 15, 
and 10 meters. The power supply is a voltage - 
doubler using a pair of silicon diodes into a pi- 
type LC filter. 
The actual construction of the kit took us just 
under 8 hours, thanks to the clear, well -illustrated 
construction manual. We then calibrated the v.f.o. 
very carefully against a good communications re- 
ceiver with a built -in crystal calibrotor. A little 
extra time spent here will pay off later in dial 
calibration accuracy, so we went back and forth 
over the various adjustments until they were just 
as close as possible. 
We then measured output voltage on 80 meters, 
with the v.f.o. loaded only by a high -impedance 
scope probe (15 meg.). Output was 24 volts r.m.s., 
but this signal dropped to 7 volts with a 
1 -meg. 
load. Since most transmitters can be driven with 
only a couple of volts, this output is more thon 
adequate. Next, we checked the dial calibration 
accuracy on all bands, taking readings every

100 kc. and checking them against our crystal 
calibrator. On 80 meters, there was absolutely no 
error in dial reading at any point -at least all 
readings were as close to the crystal readings as 
could be read by the pointer. On 40, 20, 15, amt 
the low portion of the 10 -meter band, the max- 
imum error in reading was only +0.10 %, and 
this occurred at the very top end of the bands. 
Had these bands been calibrated at their center 
instead of at the low end, then all our readings 
would have been within ±0.05 %. On the high 
portion 
of the 
10 -meter band 
(covered sep- 
arately), 
the 
maximum 
dial error 
was only 
+0.03 %. This small amount of error, by the 
way, is about one pointer thickness. While taking 
these measurements, we noted the clean, hum - 
free carrier that was produced by the Model 
722 v.f.o. 
Next, we checked the amount of frequency 
drift with changes in line voltage to see just how 
voltage -stable the unit is. We set the v.f.o. to 80 
meters and measured the frequency at a line 
voltage of 117 volts. At 105 volts, the v.f.o. 
drifted higher in frequency by only about 20 
cps. At 125 volts, we found a downward shift in 
frequency by only about 20 cps. This frequency 
shift amounts to only ±0.0005% -which is cer- 
tainly good voltage stability. 
In summary, the Model 722 v.f.o. is a well - 
designed piece of equipment that is a useful 
addition to the ham shack. It is available for 
$44.95 in kit form. It is also available for $55.95, 
factory- wired. 
SOME USES FOR 
DEFECTIVE TUBES 
By THOMAS R. HASKETT 
NORMALLY the best thing to do with 
a defective tube is to break the 
glass envelope and throw it away. That 
avoids the possibility of inadvertently 
getting it mixed up with good tubes and 
also prevents a tube racketeer from 
picking it up and reselling it. But there 
are exceptions to every rule. 
If you do any sort of electronic con- 
struction, whether from kits or starting 
from scratch, it is handy to keep an as- 
sortment of burned -out tubes on hand. 
Whenever you mount a tube socket on a 
new chassis, insert a d 
iy that will fit. 
Then when you drill, file, or otherwise 
work on the chassi-, no scrapings or fil- 
ings can find their way into the base -pin 
receptacles, where they can cause trouble 
later. 
If the dummy is the same size and 
shape as the tube that belongs in the 
socket, it can guide you in the physical 
layout of nearby components (in ternis 
of heat dissipation, shielding, unwanted 
stray coupling, etc.). And be sure to leave 
the dummy in place while wiring the 
equipment. You should be careful any- 
way, when wiring to tube sockets. to pre- 
vent solder front flowing down into pin 
receptacles. But the dummy is extra in- 
surance against such clogging. 
A dummy is also helpful in FM or TV 
sweep alignment. The good mixer tube 
is removed and replaced with a dummy 
of the same type, except that the heater 
pins have been clipped off (if the equip- 
ment has parallel filament wiring) or it is 
disabled in some other way. This retains 
normal tube capacitance in the circuit 
(don't use a shorted tube) while killing 
local -oscillator action. 
By the way, it is a good idea to paint 
an "X" on the envelopes of dummies you 
save, so that they will not be mistaken 
for good tubes.

1MODERN digital computers are playing a major role 
in the ever increasing takeover by automation. Per- 
sonnel in other fields of electronics aspiring to be- 
come computer technicians or engineers must stand ready to 
acquire some background in a very unfamiliar type of math- 
ematics. 
Although unfamiliar, this mathematics is logical and readily 
understandable. However, it will be found to somewhat op- 
pose and contradict the following two areas in our conven- 
tional mathematics: the decimal number system and conven- 
tional algebra. Instead, the binary number system and Boolean 
algebra almost completely dominate modern computer tech- 
nology. Why this is so will be subsequently explained. But 
before going on, something must be said for the conventional 
type of algebra that is universally taught. 
Although it is cast aside in computer mathematics, regular 
algebra must not be considered an inferior type. In reality, 
there are hundreds of different algebras, each superior for a 
particular application. While conventional algebra is a uni- 
versal type of algebra, it can't be effectively utilized in all 
possible mathematical situations. In computer mathematics, 
Boolean algebra is the optimum algebra to be used. As an 
analogy, it's just a case of using a 31" wrench to tighten a ;S" 
bolthead instead of a pair of pliers. 
An identical argument can be made for the choice of the 
binary number system. 
Boolean Algebra 
How are Boolean algebra concepts employed in the digital 
computer? Its use is twofold. First, it permits the engineer to 
design a logical and relatively simple computer. Second, it 
enables another person to understand and follow the logical 
operation of the computer. It's no more than that. Once the 
commercial digital computer is out in the field earning its 
keep, its operators and programmers are little concerned with 
Boolean algebra. 
Actually, the Boolean type of algebra is employed over 
other types of algebra in the design of the computer because 
it readily fits in with binary counting techniques. This other 
important area in computer mathematics must now be briefly 
discussed. 
Binary Numbers 
In our decimal method of counting, we are familiar with 
and use ten digits (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9). When counting 
beyond the number 9, we simply place a one in front of a zero 
and continue on with 10, 11, 12, 13, ... and so on to 19. Here, 
a two in front of a zero (twenty) will keep us going with 20, 
21, 22, 23, ... and so forth (using the same pattern) to 99 or 
199 or for as high as we want to go. 
In the binary method of counting, only two digits, 0 and 1, 
are ever used. For counting, the pattern remains the same as 
in the decimal system. The counting sequence is 0, 1, 10, 11, 
100, 101, 110, 111, 1000, 1001, 1010 
and so on for as high 
as we wish to go. While very, very awkward, it is not impos- 
sible to use this system in everyday life. We are just used to 
our present decimal system. There is nothing extra special 
about the decimal type. We probably started using it far back 
in history for the simple reason that man has ten fingers on his 
hands. It must be admitted, however, that the more digits 
there are in a number system, the more convenient it becomes 
for human computation. Had we adopted the binary system 
in our society, we would say that a horse has 100 legs (the 
horse wouldn't look any different because of it), we have 101 
fingers on a hand, and there are 1100 items in a dozen. 
Why, then, is the binary system used in computer circuitry? 
A little concentration will reveal that ordinary electrical cur- 
rent may be considered as a binary (two- state) phenomenon. 
Current flows or it doesn't flow -two possible distinct condi-

tions. Why not then use the binary number system in com- 
puter circuit designs as it can be made to work hand -in -hand 
with on or off electric current, thus enslaving the current to 
perform a multitude of simple and accurate arithmetic corn - 
putations. 
Again, for the average man, using the binary system in his 
daily living would be awkward and tedious. As for the digital 
computer, its unbelievable speed and ease of operation would 
obscure this awkwardness and tediousness of binary counting. 
In fact, a high degree of dependability and operation effi- 
ciency are realized if comparison is made with the results of 
using other number systems. This is the reason why the binary 
system is used. 
The first digital computers were mechanical and naturally 
slow operating. They were designed on the decimal system. 
The first electronic digital computers that followed were 
based on the decimal system. Their bulkiness, inefficiency, and 
unreliability gave way finally, via trial in other number sys- 
tems, to the superior binary type with its simple "on-off" op- 
erating property. 
Returning to Boolean algebra, this algebra, itself, is binary 
in nature. Hence, it has been employed with the binary system 
of operation. 
Boolean Theorems 
There are numerous theorems or rules associated with 
Boolean algebra (as there are with other algebras). A few will 
be examined here. (See Table 1. ) 
Notice that the algebraic theorems B and D agree for 
both algebras but disagree for A and C. One big difference is 
in the meaning of the " +" sign. In Boolean algebra it does not 
stand for addition in the sense that it does for regular algebra. 
It represents the condition "or." Thus, theorem A in Boolean 
reads "x or x is x." 
Likewise, the dot symbol does not stand for typical multi- 
plication. In Boolean, it represents the condition "and." Thus, 
x x = x is read "x and x is x." Bear in mind, the "and" denotes 
that both x's are required to obtain a value of x. It does not 
denote addition. 
It should now be evident that the identical symbolism of 
the two algebras does not completely possess the same mean- 
ing. Each tells a different story. Each tells a true story. Each 
is completely mathematical in its own way. 
March, 1963 
Taking another approach, these four Boolean theorems 
may be investigated electronically with the aid of block dia- 
grams. Within each block, diodes, voltage dividers, and proper 
source voltages are easily made to deliver the desired results. 
Two equal signal voltages (usually pulses of any conven- 
ient fixed magnitude), each called x, are applied to the two 
separate inputs of the "or" circuit block in Fig. 1A. The out- 
put will be found to be x. If signal x is removed from either 
input ( not both) , the output will also be signal x. ( See Fig. 
1B). Hence, either input ( not necessarily both) requires a 
signal to produce an output. No signal at either input will re- 
sult in an output of zero. 
Rearranging the circuitry for an "and" circuit, a signal x 
must be present at both inputs for an output of x (see Fig. 
2A) . As shown in Fig. 2B the output will be zero if either in- 
put (or both) lacks a signal voltage. 
Notice that any single input to either circuit will either 
produce a signal output or it will not (zero signal). This is a 
true binary condition. 
Perhaps the formal names for the "or" and "and" circuits 
best describe their general computer function. The terms "or- 
gate" and "and- gate" indicate that they are a sort of "connect- 
ing" circuit designed to accept and pass on binary informa- 
tion, only under the special Boolean conditions as described 
before. 
One other Boolean concept in computer electronics must be 
mentioned. The relation x' =0 holds much meaning. x' (called 
"x not ") is another way of stating the "opposite of x." As there 
can only be two possible conditions (x or 0 ) , this binary re- 
lationship is obvious 
( conversely, 0' r x) . Since x 0 = 0 it 
follows that x x = O. 
Actual circuit operation clearly displays this relationship 
and its possible practical utilization. See Fig. 3. 
Typical Example 
Suppose it is required that a specific pulse be removed from 
a train of voltage pulses being supplied by a pulse generator. 
If a single pulse can be produced elsewhere at the exact time 
the undesired pulse is being generated, a conventional phase 
inverter (with its 180° phase shift) and an "and -gate" circuit 
can be made to perform the desired elimination. 
Let the pulse ( in the train ) being removed be called x. The 
pulse train is fed directly to one input of the "and- gate." 
The single pulse (also called x) is fed to the phase inverter 
and because of inversion, leaves the inverter as x'. This x' 
is then fed to the other input of the "and- gate." 
When x' is not present, the output of the phase inverter (an 
output of the "and- gate ") is held at a d.c. level comparable 
to the x signal amplitude. When each pulse of the train ap- 
pears at the other input, the "and- gate" effectively has an x 
signal at each input and passes the entire pulse train through 
unaffected (since all other pulses have the same amplitude as 
pulse x). 
When x' does appear at the input to the "and -gate," pulse x 
of the pulse train at the other input is refused passage through 
the gate and is effectively removed from the train. Thus, 
x x = x represents the mathematical operation of the "and - 
gate" when no pulses are being eliminated and x x'= 0 is the 
mathematical representation of the "and -gate" removing a 
pulse. 
Finally, it is interesting to note that George Boole of Eng- 
land invented his algebra in the middle 1800's. It was his 
idea to investigate the process of human thought by pure 
mathematical reasoning. His work immediately triggered im- 
portant research by mathematicians in other fields, resulting 
in a lot of new mathematical discoveries. It was not until the 
years just prior to World \Var II, however, that science 
brought Boolean algebra to bear on electronic digital com- 
puter operation. Truly, mathematics never goes out of style.

graphs which require the shutter to be 
open for extended periods of time. In 
this position the cable release is actuated 
once to open the shutter, and again 
when it is desired to close the shutter. 
It is possible to photograph traces last- 
ing for several minutes in this manner if 
one of the slower speed films is used. A 
small aperture opening, low beam -in- 
tensity setting, and a low level of grati- 
cule illumination is required to prevent 
over -exposure of the film. It is not un- 
usual for the beam intensity to be set 
to a value that is barely visible to the 
eye through the camera viewer for an 
extended time exposure of this type. 
Most conventional oscilloscopes do not 
have a sweep system that will permit a 
single sweep lasting several minutes, so 
an external sweep voltage must be used. 
Cameras Using 35 -mm. Film 
Certain applications require photo- 
graphing transient signals that occur at 
random or unpredictable intervals. This 
is very difficult to do with a conventional 
CRO camera since there is no way of 
knowing exactly when the event will 
occur. A high -speed camera employing 
35 -mm. strip film is very useful in such 
cases. Such cameras are not movie cam- 
eras as they contain no shutter or frame - 
pulling mechanism. The film, instead, is 
drawn past the lens at a constant rate of 
speed which can be changed to suit re- 
quirements. A drawing of such an ar- 
rangement is shown in Fig. 9. The film 
speed is changed by selecting the appro- 
priate gear ratio and may vary from a 
few inches- per -second up to several hun- 
dred inches -per -second. 
The CRO sweep system is turned off 
when using this type of camera and only 
the vertical or Y axis is displayed. The 
constant speed of the film along the X 
axis substitutes for the usual internal 
sweep 
system. 
Finer 
definition 
or 
"spreading out" the trace is accom- 
plished by increasing the rate at which 
the film passes the lens. 
Once exposed, 35 -mm. filin must be 
developed and processed in the usual 
manner. It is very helpful to have a :35- 
mm. editor for this type of work since a 
great deal of film may have to be viewed 
before the point of interest is found. 
Typical Examples of Use 
This section will illustrate the use of a 
CRO camera to solve specific measure- 
ment problems typical of those found in 
industrial instrumentation.

amount of blade growth caused by cen- 
trifugal force, temperature, and shaft 
run -out. Fig. 11 shows the equipment 
and circuitry necessary for a measure- 
ment of this type. The capacity meter is 
a device used to detect small changes in 
length of a metallic object by measuring 
the capacity between the object and a 
fixed probe. Note that in this example 
we are measuring minute changes in 
thousandths of an inch. The special scale 
for the Y axis, calibrated in thousandths 
of an inch, is necessary since the output 
voltage for this type of device is not 
linear and the CRO centimeter scale 
cannot be used. 
( Note: The scope's in- 
ternal sweep was used to obtain the 
waveform in Fig. 10. Then, the external 
d.c. sweep arrangement shown in Fig. 
11 was used to obtain the waveform in 
Fig. 12. ) 
The CRO sweep rate was chosen in 
this example for convenience in observ- 
ing the waveshape and frequency of the 
signal. A .2 msec. /cm. sweep rate was 
used which required 2 msec. for one 
complete sweep. A camera shutter set- 
ting of 1/100 second ( 10 cosec.) yielded 
five complete sweeps of the signal for a 
uniform exposure. Aperture setting was 
f /5.6 and the beam intensity was medi- 
um- bright. 
( All sample photographs 
were taken with Polaroid type 46 -L film 
in order to facilitate reproduction.) 
Fig. 12 is a time exposure of the ca- 
pacity -probe signal which was made 
with an external X -axis input signal in 
place of the normal saw -tooth sweep 
voltage, as in Fig. 11. A d.c. output volt- 
age from the electronic tachometer that 
' 
is analogous to turbine shaft speed is 
used to drive the beam across the X axis, I 
providing a scale calibrated. directly in 
rpm. The capacity meter signal is con- 
nected to the Y axis in the normal 
manner. 
The shutter for this photograph was 
set at the "time" position and opened 
as soon as the turbine was started. About 
two minutes' exposure time was required 
for this particular test. An extended time 
exposure of this type generally requires 
the aperture to be stopped down to f /16 
with an extremely faint beam intensity 
setting. Graticule lighting must also be 
cut down to a very low level. When

using type 47 or 410 film, special pre- 
cautions must be taken to prevent ex- 
ternal light leakage from occurring with- 
in the camera. 
Using this technique a complete rec- 
ord of the performance is provided in 
one photograph at any point on the 
speed range. Of course it is not possible 
to discern any frequency information 
from a photograph of this type since the 
signal is greatly compressed along the 
X axis. It must be spread out by using 
the normal internal sweep system if this 
is the object. 
Fig. 13 is a simplified drawing of an

impact strength of materials by subject- 
ing them to a sudden blow from a

mented with four strain gages connected 
in a conventional bridge circuit. The 
flexing produced in the sample caused 
by the impact from the hammer changes 
the resistance of the strain gages and 
unbalances the bridge circuit in di-

An oscilloscope having a delayed 
sweep system is very convenient for this 
type of testing. Note the triggering cir- 
cuit consisting of the Microswitch and 
battery which is connected to the ex- 
ternal trigger input on the oscilloscope. 
This is designed to provide a time delay 
from the instant the weight is released 
and the trigger pulse is generated until 
the hammer strikes the specimen. This 
provides a pulse to start the sweep 
across before the impact occurs. How- 
ever, in order for the strain signal to 
occur at approximately the center of the 
CRT screen, the sweep rate used would 
have to be twice the length of the time 
delay provided. This is very rarely the 
case since transient signals of this type 
generally require a rapid sweep rate. An 
oscilloscope with a delayed sweep al- 
lows us to delay the start of the sweep 
to a point suitable . for displaying the 
signal in any position we wish on the 
CRT screen. The delayed sweep dial is 
usually calibrated in unit -time and can 
be set quite accurately for any sweep 
rate when the hammer drop time is 
known. 
An example of a photograph that may 
be produced by such an impact test is 
shown in Fig. 14. Since the shutter is 
only required to be open a short time, 
the "bulb" position can be used. With 
type 46 -L film one of the larger aper- 
tures would be required in conjunction 
with a bright beam intensity setting. The 
procedure calls for opening the shutter 
before the hammer is released and clos- 
ing the shutter just after it strikes the 
specimen. 
An article of this type can only cover 
some of the more important aspects of 
oscilloscope photography. If the reader 
is interested in more information, the 
various CRO camera and film manufac- 
turers will supply further details about 
their products.

Fiber -Optic Brain Cell 
(Continued front page 37) 
The type of mask just described is 
called a rejection mask: it operates by 
rejecting light. However, we would not 
know if a signal were received at all if 
all the light were successfully masked 
out. In current practice, two Sceptrons 
are used, one containing a static mask 
only, which provides a reference output. 
The photocells of the static mask and 
the memory mask are balanced against 
each other in a bridge circuit. Both Scep- 
trons are simultaneously excited by in- 
coming signals. Any signal other than 
the one which was programmed will pro- 
duce a large output from each photocell, 
which will cancel each other. For the 
right signal, there will be an unbalanced 
output from the cells, which is a measure 
of recognition. 
( Both functions can be 
included in one Sceptron.) 
The acceptance mask is a combination 
of the static mask and the negative of the 
rejection mask, i.e., the photographic 
plate of the signal is developed as a 
positive, and the static dots are super- 
imposed. This mask passes maximum 
light when the programmed signal is 
received. (See Fig. 2.) 
From here, you can light a bulb, ring 
bells, operate a cash register, a type- 
writer, or what have you. 
Kev Features 
There are three key features of the 
Sceptron: 
1. It is able to process more informa- 
tion in a smaller package than has ever 
before been possible. 
2. It is self -programming: the signal 
makes its own memory mask. 
3. It operates in "real time": decisions 
are made during the actual signal period, 
without recourse to storage and post - 
analysis. 
In contrast, computers generally hold 
the signal while they go searching 
through their memory for the desired 
comparison. For multi -word applica- 
tions, Sceptron memory units will be in 
parallel, and all %vill be simultaneously 
interrogated. 
Although much more can be said 
about technical details of operation, or 
of the many variations possible in mask- 
ing techniques, we have only attempted 
to describe the general operation of the 
device. The applications are numerous, 
and are practical because of the inher- 
ently low cost of the system. Material 
costs run about $2 per Sceptron, for in- 
stance, and with reasonable production, 
the cost of the finished product could be 
about the same as a radio tube. With 
newer fiber arrays, we can soon put 300 
memories into a "match -box" console. 
Most of us who are working with the 
Sceptron think of it as an invention as 
basic and important as the transistor.

plug life 3 to 5 times over normal ... in- 
sures 75,000 mile point life ... gives in-

NITION INTERFERENCE REDUCED 50 %. 
In conventional ignition systems, high volt- 
age at the spark plugs, falls off over 50 °, as 
engine speeds increase. The result is a weak 
spark causing incomplete combustion, loss 
of power, fouled plugs and poor gas mile- 
age. The rugged AEC 77 electronic ignition 
increases and maintains maximum high 
voltage output at the spark plugs with no 
high voltage fall off at any speed. Its hot 
spark guarantees more efficient combustion, 
delivers full engine power at over 7,500 
rpm with up to 20% more mpg. 
WORLD CHAMPION 
RACING DRIVER PHIL 
HILL USES AEC 77 ... 
REPORTS- 
"AEC 77's strong spark 
can make up for a multi- 
tude of little sins, such as 
worn points or improperly 
gapped spark plugs. It will 
make your car run 
smoother, particularly at the low end and 
will appreciably improve its performance 
and economy." 
Every AEC unit uses high quality compo- 
nents such as Delco high voltage 15 ampere 
transistors and Motorola 50 watt zener di- 
odes ... while others use two low voltage 
transistors in series with two 1 watt zener 
diodes. Every AEC Ignition coil is wound 
with Formvar insulated wire, oil impreg- 
nated and hermetically sealed for maximum 
insulation and cooling ... while others use 
enamel insulation in a tar filled coil that 
cannot handle the power AEC 77 delivers. 
Proven in over 2,000,000 miles of testing, 
AEC 77 is so dependable in performance de- 
sign and engineering, that every unit is reg- 
istered and GUARANTEED FOR 
3 FULL 
YEARS.

Turntable Testing at Home 
(Continued from page 32) 
It is therefore important to keep tracking 
error lowest at the record's inner grooves. 
This is done at the expense of allow- 
ing greater tracking error at the outside 
grooves. Clearly it is not enough to know 
the maximum tracking error of a given 
record player. An error of 2° at the out- 
side grooves probably reflects excellent 
design, while the same 2° error at the 
inside grooves might indicate relatively 
poor design. 
Tracking error can be measured with 
a protractor ( the kind with a small pin 
hole at the origin ) and a drafting tri- 
angle, as shown in Fig. 4. The triangle is 
carefully placed on the record so that its 
extension would pass through the center 
of the spindle. The protractor is then 
placed over the triangle, with the pin 
hole at the desired groove radius and 
directly over the triangle's edge. The 
stylus is placed in the pin hole. 
The most critical part of this measure- 
ment, and the one that limits its accu- 
racy, is the adjustment of the angle of 
the protractor. Keeping the pin hole on 
the edge of the triangle, the protractor 
must be turned with the stylus as pivot, 
until the protractor edge is parallel to 
the cartridge. This must be done by 
sight, and the alignment of the pin hole 
must be rechecked. The tracking error 
is the number of degrees off 90° marked 
by the triangle on the protractor scale. 
The larger the protractor the more ac- 
curate the measurement is likely to be 
With care you may expect an accuracy 
of ± 
312 deg. 
Audiophiles sometimes spend hours 
arguing the merits and faults of different 
types of components. Perhaps the meas- 
uring techniques described in this article 
can settle at least some of the arguments 
about turntables. 
TUBE TESTER AS 
VARIABLE -VOLTAGE SOURCE 
By RALPH 
E. 
ELLISON 
WHEN you are in a tight spot for an 
odd value of voltage, a.c. or d.c., 
try using your tube tester. From its fila- 
ment supply, it provides a wide range of 
directly available a.c. voltages, continu- 
ously available or adjustable in small 
increments, that generally go as low as 
1 volt and as high as 117 volts. 
To obtain these values conveniently, 
salvage the base of a discarded octal tube. 
Solder one length of flexible wire to pin 
2 inside the base and another to pin 7. 
Also solder a clip to the other end of each 
leitd. To tap the filament supply, you 
now only need to insert the octal base 
in the appropriate tester socket. 
To obtain a comparable range of d.c. 
voltages, make up a small, simple recti- 
fier -filter network for bench use and run 
the tapped -off a.c. voltages through this 
rectifier circuit.

Antennas for Business Radio 
(Continued front page 35) 
dipole, which is the industry standard. 
There is no magic way to achieve 
gain. The radiation pattern must be com- 
pressed either vertically or horizontally 
by narrowing the radiated beam. The 
vertical pattern can be compressed by 
collinear stacking of a number of verti- 
cally polarized elements. This compres- 
sion of the beam is brought about by 
increasing the vertical radiating aper- 
ture and over -all length. Pattern corn- 
pression in the horizontal plane can be 
achieved by positioning parasitic ele- 
ments to direct or reflect the radiated 
energy in the desired direction. 
Mechanical Considerations 
Once the electrical requirements of 
the antenna have been met, there are 
several mechanical considerations which 
also must be carefully weighed. For an 
antenna that is to have a specific gain, 
very little can be done to reduce the 
over -all length of the antenna and still 
maintain the necessary radiating aper- 
ture. However, by the use of metals such 
as aluminum, much can be done to pro- 
duce an efficient radiating structure that 
is light in weight and small in cross - 
section, while retaining good mechanical 
strength. 
Communications antennas are gener- 
ally designed to withstand 100 mile -per- 
hour winds and ;4" radial ice loads. An- 
tennas to withstand 100 mile -per -hour 
winds must withstand a force of 30 
pounds- per -square -foot of exposed area. 
For an antenna which is circular in cross - 
section, the projected area is used for 
calculation purposes. Thus, the total ex- 
posed length multiplied by the cross - 
section dimension of the antenna (in 
square feet) multiplied by 30 equals the 
mechanical force in pounds exerted 
against the structure in a 100 mile -an- 
hour wind. If radial ice is formed on 
the antenna, the cross- section dimension 
is increased and this increase must be 
considered when calculating the area of 
the antenna. 
In seacoast and industrial areas chem- 
ical elements present in the atmosphere 
may tend to corrode most metals. Under 
these conditions, "hurricane model" 
stainless -steel antennas as well as those 
antennas using fiber glass or other non- 
metallic elements are recommended. 
Proper Grounding 
Good grounding techniques are al- 
ways desirable. By grounding the tower 
and other structures, damage from light- 
ning can be reduced considerably. A 
grounded point or rod tower -member 
placed above the highest extremity of 
the antenna is desirable since it acts as a 
static discharger. This discharger will 
effectively relieve the high potential of 
any cloud near the antenna and thus 
result in a much lower percentage of 
hits than if the tip were not used. How- 
ever, to withstand direct hits, the an- 
tenna and structure itself must be de- 
signed to absorb the large amount of en- 
ergy present in the bolt, usually in the 
order of 100,000- ampere surges. This is 
done in many broadcast antenna instal- 
lations, such as the television antennas 
atop the Empire State Building, which 
are hit practically every time a storm 
occurs. 
The economics of the average base - 
station installation do not warrant the 
expense of designs capable of absorbing 
the full energy of the hit each time. It 
is much more practical to write an ex- 
tended- coverage clause into the over -all 
fire insurance policy for the installation 
to cover damage due to lightning and to 
replace a certain number of antennas 
which will invariably be hit. Reports in- 
dicate that less than 1 per -cent per year 
suffer hits requiring replacement of the 
antenna itself, although there may be a 
certain number of unreported cases. 
Standard d.c. grounds also minimize 
the noise and precipitation static fre- 
quently attributed to antennas that ac- 
cumulate static charges from high winds 
and dust. As these charges leak into the 
atmosphere, a continual "frying" noise 
is heard in the receiver, thereby reducing 
its sensitivity by masking weak signals. 
Grounded antenna elements drain this 
charge to reduce noise as well as any 
damage. Another expedient which has 
been used to minimize precipitation 
static is to coat the antenna with a dielec- 
tric substance. This coating effectively 
isolates the antenna elements from the 
atmosphere and minimizes static build- 
up. 
Transmission Lines 
A proper antenna -to -line impedance 
match is an important requirement for 
efficient two -way radio antennas. The 
ideal match is a resistive antenna equal 
to the characteristic impedance of the 
transmission line. The EIA has standard- 
ized on a nominal 50 -ohm coaxial trans- 
mission line. Consequently, antennas are 
designed to exhibit a nominal 50 -ohm 
load impedance. The amount that the 
antenna varies from this ideal match is 
usually expressed in terms of voltage - 
standing -wave 
ratio 
( v.s.w.r.). Any 
mismatch shows up as power returning 
down the transmission line instead of 
being radiated into space. The v.s.w.r. 
curves indicate an antenna's variation 
from an ideal impedance match and 
show the reflected power of an antenna 
over its frequency band. 
The percentage of power lost in set- 
ting up standing waves is a function, for 
the most part, of antenna and connector. 
With a ratio of 2:1, for example, approxi- 
mately 12% of the power transmitted by

the base station is lost. If the v.s.w.r. 
goes up to 3:1, power loss rises to ap- 
proximately 25%. In other words, 60 
watts of base- station power is radiated 
as only 45 watts with 15 watts of power 
lost by reflection along the length of the 
transmission line. 
The amount of signal strength lost 
along the transmission line depends on 
three construction factors. These are: 
(1) the size of the center conductor, 
(2) dielectric loss in the cable, and (3) 
conductivity of the inner and outer con- 
ductors. 
The size of the center conductor in a 
coaxial transmission line is dictated by 
the characteristic impedance of the line, 
the type of dielectric material used, and 
the inside diameter of the outer conduc- 
tor. The outer conductor size is limited 
by weight, space, and cost. 
For example, a coaxial line with an 
outer conductor that has a one -inch i.d. 
and uses pressurized air as its dielectric 
material is limited in its center conductor 
diameter to about 7 /16th of an inch. 
With the same i.d. outer conductor and 
polyethylene (a common solid dielec- 
tric) instead of pressurized air, the al- 
lowable diameter of the center conductor 
drops to 9/32nd of an inch. A reduction 
in center conductor size and the intro- 
duction of a "Iossy" dielectric insulator 
in the line approximately doubles the 
attenuation of the line in db per 100 feet. 
Coaxial transmission line using a 
foamed polyethylene dielectric material, 
which provides a dielectric constant be- 
tween air and the solid dielectric ex- 
tremes, allows the use of a larger diam- 
eter inner conductor. This results in 
lower losses than is the case with the 
solid dielectric material. 
Corrosion resistance is also an impor- 
tant consideration for a transmission line 
since the line is exposed, as is the an- 
tenna, to humidity, rain, snow, salt air, 
chemical fumes, and other environ- 
mental conditions. Copper is one of the 
most corrosion -resistant of the common 
metals. Copper cable installations 
throughout the world are still serving 
communications systems faithfully after 
as many as 25 years, attesting to copper's 
durability. 
Since the antenna in a system is 
usually its most exposed element, the 
transmission line immediately connected 
to the antenna termination can quickly 
get weather -worn. Vinyl- covered cable, 
not known for its weathering ability, suf- 
fers most. In its place '2" "Foam Heliax" 
is employed to connect to the antenna 
termination to offer greater weather re- 
sistance as well as equal flexibility. The 
use of this special jumper causes the ini- 
tial price to be slightly greater than with 
ordinary RG -8 /U coax jumpers. How- 
ever, the value received in reliable, main- 
tenance -free antenna system service 
more than offsets this cost difference.

Stated simply, the higher the antenna, 
the greater the range. Modifying this op- 
timum concept are such qualifications as 
transmission -line losses, r.f. noise, ter- 
rain, surrounding. structures, and co- 
channel interference; all contribute in 
some degree to resultant system degrada- 
tion. To achieve height, and thus extend 
the radio horizon, most base -station an- 
tennas are located on building roofs, 
hills, mountain tops, wood telephone 
poles, structural towers, or a combination 
of these. 
Irrespective of the type of mounting, 
the antenna should be above, free, and 
clear of any surrounding structures, ter- 
- 
rain, power lines, or foliage. Although 
this is not always practical, as in the case 
of antennas side -mounted on towers or 
roof -mounted on smaller buildings in 
large metropolitan and industrial areas, 
antenna isolation is nonetheless desir- 
able. 
Coaxial and ground -plane antennas 
should not be side -arm mounted on a 
tower or other metal structure unless the 
almost inevitable radiation pattern dis- 
tortion -from shielding, capacitance, 
parasitic excitation, phase cancellation 
and addition -can be tolerated. To mini- 
mize this effect, no active antenna ele- 
ment should be closer than three -quar- 
ters of a wavelength to the tower or 
other mounting surface. A further com- 
plication in out -rigging antennas on 
towers is the marked increase in wind - 
loading effect on the tower itself. Tower 
unbalance and weight limitations also 
must be considered and, in the case of 
two or more side -mounted antennas on 
lighter towers, diametric placement is 
virtually mandatory. 
Directional antennas lend themselves 
more efficiently to side -arm installation, 
from a propagation viewpoint, but gen- 
eral considerations of tower balance, 
windloading, and weight load still apply. 
The basic concept of antenna isolation at 
tower or building top, irrespective of an- 
tenna type, implies installation simplicity 
and propagation 
efficiency. Keep in 
mind, however, that the antenna must 
be accessible for periodic checks. 
Invariably, antennas mounted on 
building tops are fastened to stub pipe 
masts, building cornices, and even out - 
rigged on upper walls. The importance 
of adhering to local building codes in 
both antenna and tower erection must be 
emphasized. Most municipalities strictly 
enforce code regulations and necessary 
compliance can entail higher initial in- 
stallation costs. 
To many technicians and engineers, 
antennas do not represent the interesting 
challenge presented by electronic cir- 
cuitry. However, antenna systems should 
be given the respect they deserve, for 
without that "piece of wire sticking up 
in the air," we would not have efficient 
and effective radio communications.

Fig. 7. Hickok 656XC NTSC -bar generator 
also produces dot and crosshatch patterns. 
The pattern produced by the rainbow 
generator is a smooth transition or blend- 
ing of colors like a spectrum. The gener- 
ator's principal usefulness is in deter- 
mining if the color circuits are operating. 
In conjunction with a scope, it can also 
be used to make chroma and demodu- 
lator phasing adjustments. 
The pattern produced by the gated - 
rainbow generator is a serrated contin- 
uous color display with nine vertical 
black bars as shown in Fig. 9. Each of 
the ten color bars it produces, spaced 
precisely at 30° phase intervals, is a 
small segment of the rainbow pattern. 
The gated -rainbow generator also pro- 
duces its own horizontal sync pulse and 
a color -burst signal as well, to make 
receiver adjustment reliable. Since 
the rainbow pattern changes hue from 
the left to the right side of the screen, 
the horizontal sync pulse is necessary to 
lock the horizontal oscillator in the color 
receiver so that a stable color display 
can be produced. The horizontal hold 
control in the receiver must be accurate- 
ly set to minimize an unstable display. 
This applies to both types of rainbow 
generator. The gated- rainbow generator 
utilizes one of its 12 gated bars as a burst 
signal whereas a plain rainbow gen- 
erator makes use of the burst gate in the 
receiver to gate out a portion of the 
3.56 -mc. c.w. signal, following the hori- 
zontal sync pulse, to serve as the burst. 
Rainbow Generator Circuit 
The rainbow- generator circuitry is 
not complex. The block diagram of the 
Hickok Model 660 rainbow generator is 
shown in Fig. 5. A 3.563795 -mc. crystal 
oscillator is the chroma oscillator. Note 
that this frequency is 15,750 cps below 
the 
3.579545 -mc. 
color 
subcarrier. 
When this frequency is fed to a color 
receiver, a rainbow pattern of all colors 
will be produced for each horizontal 
scan, that is, there will be a 360° phase 
shift between the subcarrier oscillator in 
the set and the 3.563795 -mc. output of 
the rainbow generator for each hori- 
zontal scan. The reference for this oper- 
ation is the free -running subcarrier oscil- 
lator in the set. Since the subcarrier 
oscillator is usually crystal controlled, 
stability will be satisfactory for most 
field applications. Fig. 6 shows how a 
rotating vector produces a rainbow dis- 
play as its phase changes. 
The visible color display on the screen 
of the picture tube starts at about 20° 
which indicates the end of the blanking 
period. The color blends from one end to 
the other starting with orange and end- 
ing in green. A correctly adjusted re- 
ceiver will show, starting at the left side 
of the screen, 40% reds, followed by 
40% blues, and ending with 20% greens. 
The hue control in the color set should 
be capable of varying this color combi- 
nation to either the left or the right ap- 
proximately ± 10% either side of the 
center hue -control setting. Since the 
output signal of the rainbow generator 
does not contain a brightness corn- 
Fig. 8. Hickok 660 rainbow generator can 
also generate dot and crosshatch patterns.

poilent, the contrast control will have 
little or no effect on the display. In 
addition to checking hue control during 
the installation of a set in the home, the 
rainbow generator can be of help in 
quickly locating a bad demodulator 
tube. 
ELECTRONICS WORLD 

If the B -Y or Z demodulator tube is 
bad, the blues will be missing. Should 
the reds be missing, this would indicate 
trouble in the R -Y or X demodulator. If 
the greens are not present, the trouble 
is likely to be in the G -Y amplifier or 
matrix. Reference to the tube location 
chart included in most sets should lead 
to the defective tube. It should be 
pointed out that an NTSC generator will 
locate the aforementioned faults in the 
same manner. The crosshatch and dot 
generator section of this generator is 
practically identical to that in the NTSC 
generator just discussed. 
To sum things up, the rainbow gen- 
erator is the less expensive and the 
more portable of the two generators. It 
is suitable for color receiver installation 
since only purity, convergence, and 
monochrome balance adjustments are 
usually made in the home. It also gives 
an indication that the color circuitry is 
at least working. However, color align- 
ment with a rainbow generator is not 
recommended if a high -degree of ac- 
curacy is required. 
An NTSC color -bar generator can be 
used to accurately align any receiver 
regardless of circuit design. It can check 
the performance of a receiver more 
critically because each fully saturated 
color requires a brightness component. 
Pure yellow, cyan, and magenta cannot 
be produced with a rainbow generator, 
Fig. 10. Hickok 661 develops NTSC co- 
lors singly, each in full- screen dis- 
play, rather than as simultaneous bars. 
although they can be with an NTSC 
generator. These complementary colors 
are critical and the slightest phase and 
brightness -adjustment errors will change 
them noticeably. 
The NTSC color -bar generator is ex- 
cellent for troubleshooting because it 
can properly energize all circuits of in- 
terest with stable, standardized signals. 
Also, it can never be rendered obsolete 
by changes in receiver circuitry. It is 
based on present transmission standards, 
and is useful as long as those standards 
are retained.

Radio & TV News 
Events in the Service Industry 
Fj IRST ORDER of business this 
month, as promised, is resumption 
of the subject that filled our last column. 
We had dealt with an evaluation of serv- 
ice- industry problems by Frank J. Moch, 
executive director of NATESA, and his 
tentative proposals for future action. 
One of his chief points was that the 
character of the industry, along with our 
entire economy, was undergoing certain 
basic changes. Many of these changes, 
since they are the result of powerful 
forces outside of service or any single 
segment of the economy, are not realis- 
tically subject to control or alteration by 
the independent service industry or by 
individuals within it. Therefore, instead 
of concentrating fire on convenient 
scapegoats, service would spend its en- 
ergy more fruitfully by formulating a 
positive program for adjusting to forth- 
coming changes. 
"Pool your resources," Moch's own 
phrase, is the key to his program. He 
feels that there are many areas in which 
his slogan can be applied effectively. 
These include advertising, the purchase 
of parts and equipment ( along with the 
maintenance of stock, to avoid inventory 
duplication ) , the purchase of TV sets 
and other merchandise for retailing (to 
compete with high- volume, low -price 
entrepreneurs), and even the centraliza- 
tion of service facilities, including the 
best use of the skills of individual spe- 
cialists. 
He acknowledges that this approach 
involves some sacrifice of a traditional, 
"rugged individualism" that is jealously 
guarded by many owners of small shops. 
He doubtless anticipates resistance to his 
program on these grounds. He probably 
also feels that, in answering the advan- 
tages of "big -business" servicing by 
adapting some of its own techniques, the 
little people in the business stand their 
best chance of perpetuating their indi- 
vidual character and identity. Such ideas 
merit long and serious discussion. All we 
can do is start the ball rolling. 
Can It Work? 
Many who are disposed toward a tra- 
ditional way of looking at things will find 
his suggestions unacceptable. In fact, 
some are sure to see in it a threat to a 
way of life. Others will simply shrug 
and say it is unworkable. All dissidents 
might take a hard look at some things 
going on in the service industry right 
now. 
Any number of associations today 
offer medical and other insurance plans 
on a group basis. Many will automat- 
ically "cover" for a dealer member who 
becomes sick or is otherwise out of ac- 
tion, so that his business is kept intact 
until he can resume. Cross -checking be- 
tween one dealer and another for the 
availability of hard -to -get parts is a prac- 
tice that may be even older than the 
association idea. Swapping of technical 
expertise has been going on for years 
with no fuss. While these constitute evi- 
dence of successful cooperation, which 
is not the same thing as outright pooling, 
a recent trend toward the latter is also 
observable. 
Present Examples 
McWilliams Radio -TV Service of San 
Francisco is in the transistor -radio re- 
pair business quite actively because, 
says president John McWilliams, "the 
reluctance of most servicing dealers to 
tackle these little monsters" has created 
a need. The firm has been assigned war- 
ranty work by at least two major man- 
ufacturers or importers and is negotiat- 
ing with others. "We would like to ex- 
tend our service facilities to other deal- 
ers in the area ... to service the tran- 
sistor repair business they are now turn- 
ing away," says McWilliams. If his plan 
succeeds, San Francisco will have cen- 
tralized service in this specialty without 
the loss of dealer identity. 
Another case: The members of TESA- 
Miami have set up and equipped a single 
shop to which they may all bring their 
tough dogs. It will be manned by expert 
members in various fields. More recent- 
ly, this association has asked specialists 
on tape recorders, phonographs, inter- 
coms, CB, auto radio, color TV, and 
other fields to place their names on a 
reference list that will provide a speedier 
interchange 
of needed 
information. 
What will be the next step? 
We could cite other cases in which as- 
pects of Moch's program, although not 
the entire package, are in use today. 
More interesting than added proof is this 
point: where such pooled activities exist, 
they have been accepted without great 
hue and cry. At least some change in this 
direction, then, is taking place infor- 
mally today, without conscious planning 
toward a grand goal. Yet we are sure 
that the clear statement of possible re- 
sults will arouse opposition. Many will 
see in it a threat to a way of life. 
As for ourselves, we neither endorse 
nor oppose the Moch objectives. They 
have received consideration at length 
because they represent a serious attempt 
to develop a positive program -and also 
because we frankly hope to stir up sorely 
needed discussion on this matter. We are 
interested in all shades of opinion, but 
ELECTRONICS WORLD 

dissidents can be most helpful if they keep one point in minci; 
it is not enough to reject someone else's answers. You should 
try to offer constructive alternatives. 
Profit in "Wholesale Only" 
A story in the "Newsletter" of TSA of northeastern New 
York points a moral for distributors. A relatively small dis- 
tributor who operates profitably on a strictly wholesale basis 
noted the annual financial report of one of the larger, whole- 
sale- retail, mail -order businesses. He noted that its losses for 
the year recently ended were $1,217,073. exceeding the 
losses of more than half a million for the year before. The 
"smaller" distributor (Ran Gardenier of Troy TV) is now 
boasting that his firm's profits exceed those of the larger 
organization by "more than $1,217,073." While he will not 
say exactly what his profits are, he makes the point that the 
large, impressive, and cumbersome electronic sales establish- 
ment that seeks business volume wherever it can get it is 
not necessarily following the shrewdest policy. "A wholesale - 
only distributor is a serviceman's friend," he says, "and 
this friendship can pay off." 
Are You a Laborer? 
For years, business advisers have been pounding away at 
the independent service industry to stop hiding behind 
markup on parts for income, to insist on due worth for their 
labor, and accordingly to mark reasonable labor charges 
clearly on their bills. We hate to confuse the issue, but we 
think A. Edward Stevens, writing in "TESA -Miami News," 
has a good point -and he doesn't like that word "labor," on 
the bill or elsewhere. 
He's all for an honest fee, but feels that "technical services" 
or "professional services" carries more dignity than "labor." 
Come to think of it, technicians might feel less reluctant 
about charging their worth with that term. 
CREATIVE 
ARTICLE WRITER... 
Electronic Technology 
We need a versatile, creative, technically oriented 
writer to interpret and report on new product, market 
and growth developments. In one year we will have 
practically doubled our plant size (to 1 million square 
feet), introduced many exciting new developments in 
the semiconductor field (integrated circuits, field- effect 
transistors, SCR's and bi- stable switches), and opened 
up vast new applications in the automotive, consumer 
and controls field. 
This is an excellent opportunity to contribute to a 
better understanding of these highly technical areas 
by initiating and generating all types of written 
material with particular emphasis on feature stories. 
This opening requires an excellent writing and 
electronics background with a desire to teach and 
communicate. If you consider yourself an expert in 
this area write to:

fered in a full range of fractional sizes from 
1 /20th to one fall h.p. Higher ranges are possible. 
Among the features claimed for the new units are 
reduced electrical noise, reduced acoustical noise, 
and the elimination of arcing at high altitudes. 
With the substitution of transistors and, in 
some cases, silicon -controlled rectifiers for the 
usual commutators, maintenance problems have 
been drastically reduced or virtually eliminated, 
according to the company.

SPECIFICATIONS 
The Stromberg- Carlson ASR -880 is one of the most 
powerful stereo amplifiers available at 
any price. 
Designed with the flexibility Of a recording Studio 
control panel. each channel has individual tone con- 
trols and professional mixer -type Separate 
volume 
Controls which operate in Conjunction With the master 
gain control. Specially engineered output transformers 
utilize massive, grain -oriented steel cores for ex- 
ceptionally good low frequency power handling with 
minimum distortion. In rating the ASR -880 a leading 
test laboratory reported A pleasant surprise came in 
measuring the power output of the ASR -880. 
Each 
channel delivered 50 watts at 2% harmonic distor- 
tion. or 48 watts at 17 distortion. This is unusual 
in an amplifier rated at 32 watts per channel. Only 
0.6 or 0.7 millivolts at the phono inputs will drive 
the amplifier to IO watts output per channel. At 
normal gain settings of the unit the hum level 
is 
better than 70 db below 10 watts even on phono 
input. This 
Is Completely inaudible. 
The ASR880 
has a rare combination of very high gain and very 
low hum. The amplifier has
