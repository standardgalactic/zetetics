A Two–Stage Bayesian Sequential Assessment of Exploratory Hypotheses
Abstract
Separating confirmatory and exploratory analyses is vital for ensuring the credibil-
ity of research results. Here, we present a two-stage Bayesian sequential procedure that
combines a maximum of exploratory freedom in the first stage with a strictly confirmatory
regimen in the second stage.
It allows for flexible sampling schemes and a statistically
coherent carry-over of information from the exploratory to the confirmatory stage. We be-
lieve that this procedure will facilitate preregistration as well as the formulation of precise
hypotheses in the field of psychology and can be integrated elegantly into the registered re-
port publishing framework. We demonstrate the methodology with a simulated application
example from the field of social neuroscience.

A transparent distinction between exploratory and confirmatory analyses is vital for
ensuring the credibility of research results (Wagenmakers et al., 2012). New publication
formats, such as Registered Reports and Exploratory Reports, as well as the ascent of pre-
registration in the social sciences are founded on this premise (Chambers, 2013; McIntosh,
2017; Nosek & Lindsey, 2018).
However, many researchers are still hesitant to commit
to a single analysis pipeline in the form of a preregistration before seeing the data. This
is particularly the case in disciplines such as neuroscience, where elaborate data prepro-
cessing procedures and complex data structures make it challenging to decide on the most
appropriate analysis method a priori (Poldrack et al., 2017).
Here we present a two-stage Bayesian sequential procedure that combines a maximum
of exploratory freedom in the first stage with a strictly confirmatory regimen in the second
stage, while allowing for flexible sampling schemes and a statistically coherent carry-over
of information. This procedure may benefit researchers who are faced with the dilemma
on whether (a) to shoot from the hip by running a confirmatory study with inadequate
planning, risking severe deviations from the preregistration plan (Sarafoglou et al., 2022), or
(b) to sacrifice resources to an initial exploratory study that does not allow for hypothetico-
deductive inference (Jebb et al., 2017).
The Two-Stage Bayesian Sequential Procedure
Figure 1 illustrates the two-stage sequential Bayesian process. At the first stage, re-
searchers can explore a variety of different analysis plans, including alternative preprocessing
techniques, statistical models and hypotheses, outcome variables, and participant inclusion
criteria. Researchers are able to do this as data roll in, sequentially updating the knowl-
edge about competing models or hypotheses (Schönbrodt et al., 2017). In the exploratory
stage, there is only a single rule: “anything goes”. For example, in neuroscience, researchers
may test the same conceptual hypothesis using different voxel-based definitions of a brain
region (Poldrack, 2007), or different methods to select electrode channels in EEG analyses
(Alotaiby et al., 2015). The exploratory stage can be stopped as soon as the researcher has

Figure 1. The two-stage sequential Bayesian procedure. In the exploratory phase, sampling
continues until a promising analysis method has been selected (T1). In the confirmatory
phase the selected hypothesis is put to the test. Sampling stops once sufficient evidence
has accrued for the alternative hypothesis (T2a) or for the null hypothesis (T2c), or until
resources are depleted (T2b).
identified a hypothesis and associated analysis method that is deemed sufficiently promising
for a strictly confirmatory test. At this freely chosen point in time (i.e., T1 in Figure 1),
the researcher enters the confirmatory part of the study.
The second, confirmatory, stage starts by preregistering the exact analysis pipeline
that was selected based on the exploratory analyses. Preregistration is now straightforward
since the researcher already has analysis scripts detailing the exact analysis procedure that
are based on the acquired knowledge of data structures from the first stage. The goal of
the confirmatory stage is to test the concrete hypothesis extracted from the exploratory
stage.
The hypothesis test can be conducted in a sequential manner again, where the
researcher stops data collection as soon as sufficient evidence has been obtained for the
null or alternative hypothesis, or a maximum sample size has been reached (e.g., Stefan et
al., 2019). Evidence is quantified by means of the Bayes factor, with Bayes factors larger
than one indicating evidence for the alternative hypothesis and evidence smaller than one
indicating evidence for the null hypothesis (Jeffreys, 1961; Rouder et al., 2018).

Notably, the Bayesian approach allows the coherent carry-over of information from
the exploratory to the confirmatory stage.
Following the principle “today’s posterior is
tomorrow’s prior” (Lindley, 1972, p. 2), information from the exploratory stage can be used
to formulate prior distributions on all model parameters in the confirmatory stage. This can
be viewed as enriching the hypothesis based on prior knowledge, or putting probabilistic
constraints on the parameter space to make the models more informative (Lee & Vanpaemel,
2017). The easiest way to do this is to use the posterior distributions from the exploratory
stage as priors for the confirmatory stage (Ly et al., 2019; Verhagen & Wagenmakers, 2014).
However, researchers who worry that their exploratory results may be overoptimistic may
adopt a more cautionary approach and discount the information from the first stage to
some degree – for instance by using power priors (Chen et al., 2000) or by incorporating
knowledge about the results from the alternative, less promising analyses; doing so will
shrink the prior distribution for the confirmatory stage toward the null value.
The confirmatory stage can result in three qualitatively distinct outcomes: The ex-
ploratory results from the first stage are supported, as indicated by compelling evidence
in favor of the alternative hypothesis (e.g., T2a in Figure 1); the exploratory results are
disconfirmed, as indicated by compelling evidence in favor of the null hypothesis (e.g., T2c
in Figure 1), or the data remain ambiguous with regard to the tested hypotheses (e.g., T2b
in Figure 1). The latter outcome can occur when resource constraints prohibit the contin-
uation of data collection and true parameter values fall somewhere in between the values
postulated in the null and alternative model.
Neural Correlates of Perspective Taking: A Simulated Application Example
In the following, we briefly illustrate the practical use of the two-stage Bayesian
sequential procedure with a simulated application example from the field of social neuro-
science.
The simulation code and a detailed documentation can be found on https://
osf.io/z3ckm/.
A group of fictitious researchers conduct a functional MRI study in which participants

complete a task measuring the neural correlates of perspective taking (Lamm et al., 2019;
Schurz et al., 2014). The participants complete this task under two different conditions. In
one condition, they are subjected to some treatment that should increase their perspective
taking abilities. In the other condition, this treatment is absent.1 The goal of the study is
to determine whether the treatment causes a change in task-related activation in the right
parietal cortex.
Based on previous findings, researchers expect that the effect of interest should be
localized in one of the ten subareas of the right parietal cortex described in the brain atlas
by Mars et al. (2011), see Figure 2A. However, due to the novelty of the treatment, they
are uncertain which exact subarea might be affected. Moreover, they are not sure of the
size of the region of interest (ROI) they should use in their analysis. For each subarea, the
brain atlas offers four different size definitions, but the researchers have no prior knowledge
about which definition might be the best one. Thus, in total there are 40 different possible
definitions of the ROI to choose from, and the researchers are struggling to preregister
the specific ROI that they wish to use in their analysis. To overcome this difficulty, the
researchers follow the Bayesian two-stage design, using the following decision strategies:
• In the exploratory phase, the researchers monitor the Bayesian hypothesis test for each
ROI. They decide to measure at least ten participants, and then stop the exploratory
phase as soon as one of the ROIs results in a Bayes factor larger than 10. Then, they
choose this ROI for their confirmatory study, and preregister it accordingly. If no ROI
definition results in a BF larger than 10 after 30 participants, the researchers cancel
the study without a confirmatory phase.
• In the confirmatory phase, the researchers first measure ten participants, and then
monitor the Bayes factors until one of three events occurs that cause the study to
be discontinued: Either they observe a BF larger than 100, which they consider
compelling evidence for an effect of the treatment on brain activity; or they observe

this scenario is completely fictional.

a BF smaller than 1/10, which they consider enough evidence that the treatment has
no substantial effect on brain activity after all; or they run out of time and financial
resources for the study.
We simulated 100 runs of the described two-stage procedure for two different scenarios.
The simulation code and figures depicting all of these runs can be found on https://
osf.io/z3ckm/. In the first scenario, there was a sphere of increased activity due to the
treatment in one of the specified ROIs (radius = 4mm, MNI coordinates: x = 56, y =
-34, z = 38, cf. Figure 2A). In 79 of the simulated runs, the researchers ended up with
substantial evidence in favor of the treatment effect in the confirmatory phase (cf. Figure
2B). In 14 runs, the researchers identified a promising ROI in the exploratory phase, but
then obtained strong evidence for a null effect in the confirmatory phase. Finally, seven
runs yielded inconclusive evidence. In the second simulation scenario, the treatment had no
effect on brain activity in any of the ROIs. In 45 of the runs, the study was stopped after
the exploratory phase, because no ROI reached a BF > 10. Of the remaining runs, 51 runs
resulted in strong evidence for the null hypothesis (cf. Figure 2C), only one run resulted in
strong evidence for the alternative hypothesis, and 3 runs resulted in inconclusive evidence
in the confirmatory phase.
In summary, the two-stage procedure appears to be a practical research method in
this fictitious application example. In most cases where there really is a treatment effect,
the exploratory stage allows the researchers to quickly specify the most appropriate ROI,
and then find convincing evidence for the effect in the confirmatory stage, using no more
resources than necessary. Despite its high degree of flexibility, the procedure also nearly
never leads the researchers to erroneously claim the existence of an effect if a true effect
is absent.
Although it can happen by random chance that the researchers identify an
apparently promising ROI in the exploratory phase, this spurious result would rarely achieve
a convincing level of evidence in the confirmatory phase. It is illustrative to contrast this
with the situation that would arise if the researchers would forego the confirmatory phase,
and base their conclusions solely on the results of their exploratory analyses. Then, the

Marked in different colors are the ten subareas of the right parietal cortex as described by

In the exploratory phase (left part of each plot), researchers monitor the Bayes factors for
each of the different ROIs. After a minimum of ten participants, the researchers stop the
exploratory phase as soon as one ROI has given a Bayes factor larger than 10 in favor of their
hypothesis. In the confirmatory phase (right part of each plot), the researchers sequentially
test their research hypothesis using the ROI definition identified in the exploratory phase.
The researchers sample participants until they achieve a Bayes factor larger than 100 (as
depicted in B), which they consider compelling evidence for their hypothesis; or until they
achieve a Bayes factor smaller than 1/10 (as depicted in C), which they consider enough
evidence against their hypothesis; or until they run out of resources (not depicted here).

large number of researcher degrees of freedom would surely lead to a high false-positive
rate (54% of cases in our example, if BF > 10 is used as a threshold). We would like to
emphasize, though, that the error rates we report here are specific to the simulation scenario
we used. Additional research will be needed to discern how often the two-stage procedure
leads to the correct decision in different situations.
Discussion
The two-stage Bayesian sequential procedure offers multiple advantages: (1) The
proposed procedure facilitates the specification of precise hypotheses and their translation
to statistical models; (2) Analyses in the confirmatory stage can be fixed to the precise
setup that was piloted in the exploratory stage, making preregistration straightforward
and potentially reducing the risk of unplanned deviations; (3) The Bayesian framework
allows for a seamless integration of knowledge obtained from exploratory analyses into the
confirmatory trial; (4) The sampling plan is flexible and efficient. Sequential testing has
repeatedly been shown to be about 50% more efficient than conducting fixed-N trials with
the same power (Schönbrodt et al., 2017; Schnuerch & Erdfelder, 2020), and the Bayesian
approach allows for ad-hoc adjustments of the sampling plan, for example to react to changes
in available resources (Rouder, 2014); (5) Overconfidence based on exploratory results leads
to decreased predictive accuracy of the alternative hypothesis in the confirmatory stage and
is naturally penalized in the Bayes factor. This means that researchers are motivated to
formulate realistic expectations and be conscious about their modeling choices.
Conceptually, the Bayesian two-stage design is similar to a classic pilot-study design
where an exploratory pilot phase can be used to gain experience with the materials, pro-
cedure, and data environment, for the purpose of subsequently conducting a confirmatory
trial (Leon et al., 2011).
However, the proposed two-stage design possesses two impor-
tant features that distinguish it from classic pilot study designs. First, data collection in
both stages is conducted in a sequential manner, leading to substantial efficiency benefits
compared to traditional pilot study designs where sample sizes (at least in the confirma-

BAYESIAN SEQUENTIAL ASSESSMENT OF EXPLORATORY HYPOTHESES
10
tory stage) are typically fixed in advance (Schönbrodt et al., 2017). Second, data are not
discarded after the pilot study, but instead used to enrich the tested hypotheses in the
confirmatory phase in a mathematically coherent manner that takes the uncertainty about
population parameters into account. This does not only make the confirmatory tests more
specific, but can also increase their efficiency with regard to expected sample sizes (Stefan
et al., 2019).
In our view, the two-stage sequential Bayesian procedure is particularly well-suited for
publication in the Registered Report format (Chambers, 2013). The first stage of the Regis-
tered Report can serve as a platform to transparently report the analysis results conducted
in the exploratory phase and to determine the exact analysis path for the confirmatory
phase in consultation with the reviewers. In the second stage of the Registered Report,
the confirmatory phase can be executed and reported. Thus, the procedure of Registered
Reports closely mirrors the two-stage Bayesian sequential design. However, may also be
beneficial to publish the two stages of the design separately, particularly if exploratory ana-
lyses or the derived experimental design are sufficiently complex to make an independent
contribution to the literature. In this case, the first stage can, for example, follow the for-
mat of an exploratory report (McIntosh, 2017) or of a study protocol submission, as it is
common for clinical trials (Li et al., 2017).
It is important to note that the Bayesian sequential two-stage procedure does not re-
lieve researchers of their due diligence. Although “anything goes” in the exploratory stage,
it is still important to distinguish exploratory from confirmatory results. If analyses are
optimized for unambiguous hypothesis testing results in the exploratory stage, parameter
estimates resulting from these analyses might be inflated (Simonsohn, 2014). Moreover,
researchers need to be careful to avoid the double-use of data: The prior distribution for-
mulated based on exploratory data should not be re-used to analyze the same exploratory
data (or a combined data set).
Lastly, the prior distribution under the alternative hy-
pothesis should not be adjusted if the evidence in the first stage pointed towards the null
hypothesis (Jeffreys, 1961). This is due to the fact that under a true null effect the posterior

BAYESIAN SEQUENTIAL ASSESSMENT OF EXPLORATORY HYPOTHESES
11
under the alternative model will mimic the null model, which makes the models virtually
indistinguishable in the confirmatory stage. Additionally, researchers need to be aware in
this case that if their inferential goals changed to confirming a null result based on initial
evidence for the null model, the criteria for selecting an analysis pathway based on the ex-
ploratory results may change as well. For example, while they might find it worthwhile to
focus on a subgroup of participants in which an effect seems to be strongest to demonstrate
the existence of a phenomenon, they might find that confirming the absence of said effect
in the whole population might be more interesting.
In general, researchers need to carefully consider their analysis choices and reflect on
their theoretical implications. For example, simply choosing the analysis pathway yielding
the strongest evidence in the exploratory phase may not yield the most severe test of a
substantive theory. Additionally, every specific analysis pathway may limit the external
validity of the study by restricting the generalizability to a specific context and procedure
(Lin et al., 2021). It also needs to be considered that if the posterior from exploratory
analyses is used as a prior, the tested alternative hypothesis in the confirmatory stage is
an informed version of the alternative hypothesis tested in the exploratory stage, so the
hypothesis tests in the two stages answer slightly different research questions (Etz et al.,
2018).
Overall, we believe that the two-stage Bayesian sequential assessment of exploratory
hypotheses addresses several methodological concerns. It facilitates preregistration, takes
resource constraints seriously, elegantly connects exploratory and confirmatory aspects of
research, motivates researchers to carefully consider their analytic choices, and allows re-
searchers to quantify evidence in favor and against their focal hypothesis. We hope that the
procedure will be a valuable addition to the methodological toolbox of many social science
researchers.
