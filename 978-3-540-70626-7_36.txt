Consistent Histories
Robert B. Grifﬁths
The consistent histories interpretation of quantum mechanics was introduced by
Grifﬁths in 1984 [1], and further developed by Omn`es in 1987 [2]. It is essentially
identical to the decoherent histories approach of Gell–Mann and Hartle that ﬁrst
appeared in 1989 [3]. See the monographs [4] and [5] for a detailed treatment and
more extensive bibliographies.
In essence, what the consistent histories approach does is to introduce probabili-
ties into quantum mechanics in a fully consistent and physically meaningful way. In
Copenhagen quantum mechanics (i.e., the version in most current textbooks) prob-
abilities are introduced with reference to measurements and refer (if one is careful)
only to measurement outcomes, macroscopic states of the measurement appara-
tus (“pointer positions”) after the measurement is over. ( Born rule; Metaphysics
in Quantum Mechanics; Nonlocality; Orthodox Interpretation; Schr¨odinger’s Cat;
Transactional Interpretation). How these probabilities are related to the microscopic
quantum properties supposedly measured is obscure, due to the infamous mea-
surement problem. ( Bohmian mechanics; Measurement theory; Metaphysics in
Quantum Mechanics; Modal Interpretation; Objectiﬁcation; Projection Postulate.)
By contrast, the consistent histories approach assigns probabilities to both micro-
scopic and macroscopic states of affairs, using the same formalism for both, without
any reference to measurements. Actual laboratory measurements can then be dis-
cussed in purely quantum terms using the same principles that apply to any quantum
process.  Hidden variables play no role in the consistent histories approach, which
employs the standard quantum  Hilbert space. And there is no such thing as a
classical world or classical measuring apparatus lying outside the quantum domain.
Instead, classical physics is an approximation to quantum mechanics, one that works
very well in certain situations.
Copenhagen quantum mechanics is a “black box” description in which a macro-
scopic preparation procedure is followed by a macroscopic measurement outcome,
and what happens in between cannot be discussed in terms of microscopic physics
if one wants to avoid paradoxes. The consistent histories approach opens the box
without generating paradoxes ( errors and paradoxes in quantum mechanics), and
thus extends Copenhagen to allow a consistent discussion of microscopic (or macro-
scopic) quantum physics in probabilistic terms.

Consistent Histories
Let us see how this works for a spin-half particle whose z component of angular
momentum Sz can take on only two values, +1/2 and −1/2 in units of ℏ. These
correspond to orthogonal vectors (or rays) in a two-dimensional complex Hilbert
space. Each vector can be interpreted as the logical negation of the other, so +1/2
and −1/2 are mutually exclusive possibilities, one of which must be true. The actual
value can be determined by carrying out a  Stern–Gerlach measurement; see Spin;
Vector model.
As there are no preferred directions in space, the preceding comments apply
equally to the x component of angular momentum, Sx, which is either +1/2 or
−1/2. In classical physics the conjunction of two descriptions of a physical system
is always a meaningful description; thus “Lx = 0.002 J s AND Lz = −0.002 J s”
makes perfect sense when referring to two components of angular momentum of a
spinning top. But “Sx = +1/2 AND Sz = −1/2” for a spin-half particle cannot
be associated with any vector in the quantum Hilbert space, and in the consistent
histories approach it is considered a meaningless statement: quantum mechanics
can assign it no meaning. Similarly, “Sx = +1/2 OR Sz = −1/2” is meaningless.
Note that “meaningless” is very different from “false,” since the logical negation of a
false statement is a true statement, whereas the negation of a meaningless statement
is equally meaningless. For more details, see Sect. 4.6 of [5].
The single framework rule of consistent histories states that two (or more) in-
compatible quantum descriptions – such as Sx = +1/2 and Sz = −1/2, or other
properties represented by noncommuting projectors – cannot be combined to form
a meaningful quantum description. Quantum incompatibility is a concept difﬁcult
to grasp and easily misunderstood, so the following analogy may be helpful. A
photographer taking pictures of Mt. Rainier may do so from a variety of different
directions or perspectives: north, south, east, etc. The perspective is chosen by the
photographer and has no effect on the reality represented by the mountain. The cho-
sen perspective makes it possible to answer certain questions but not others on the
basis of the resulting photograph: a view from the south will not indicate what is
happening on the northern slopes. Now replace the photographer with a physicist,
the mountain with a spin-half particle, and the choice of perspective with a decision
to measure a particular component of its angular momentum. The physicist’s choice
is free and has no inﬂuence on the physical reality associated with the particle before
it is measured. However, several photographs of a mountain taken from different
perspectives can be combined to provide a more complete description, whereas this
is not possible for measurements of different components of spin-half angular mo-
mentum. The issue is not that the apparatus will perturb the particle – it certainly
will, but we are interested in the particle’s state before the measurement. The point
is that there is no physical reality associated with simultaneous values of Sx and Sz,
and what is not real cannot be measured.
The consistent histories approach treats the time development of a quantum sys-
tem as probabilistic, rather than deterministic, and uses  Schr¨odinger’s equation to
calculate the requisite probabilities. In the simplest case the  Born rule gives
Pr(φj | ψ) = |⟨φj|T (t1, t0)|ψ⟩|2

for the conditional probability that the quantum system is in the state |φj⟩, be-
longing to the  orthonormal basis {|φj⟩}, at time t1, given the state |ψ⟩at time
t0. Here T (t′, t) is the unitary time development operator that results from solving
Schr¨odinger’s equation; it is exp[−i(t′ −t)H/ℏ] if the Hamiltonian H is indepen-
dent of time.
Several comments are in order. First, (1) applies to a closed or isolated quantum
system, as Schr¨odinger’s equation only works for this case. Second, unlike Copen-
hagen, the probability (1) refers not to outcomes of some external measurement, but
to physical states inside the closed system, independent of whether or not it is being
measured. (These could be pointer states if the measurement apparatus is itself part
of the closed quantum system, i.e., inside the box.) Third, the states {|φj⟩} must be
orthogonal, for only then do they represent mutually exclusive possibilities appro-
priate for a quantum sample space. Nonorthogonal states are incompatible (unless
multiples of each other), and hence it is meaningless to ask whether one or the other
occurred. Fourth, one need not assume that t0 precedes t1. The  Born rule and its
consistent extensions (see below) work equally well for both senses of time, so that
introducing probabilities into quantum mechanics does not in and of itself single out
a direction of time.
The right side of (1) is often written as |⟨φj| ˆψ⟩|2, where | ˆψ⟩= T (t1, t0)|ψ⟩is
obtained from |ψ⟩by integrating Schr¨odinger’s equation from t0 to t1. When used
in this way | ˆψ⟩, which is typically incompatible with the basis states {|φj⟩}, does
not represent the physical reality of the quantum system at time t1. It is instead a
mathematical construct, a pre-probability in the terminology of [5], used for com-
puting probabilities. One could equally well compute these probabilities by starting
with each of the |φj⟩and integrating Schr¨odinger’s equation in the reverse direction
from t1 to t0, making no reference whatsoever to | ˆψ⟩. For further discussion, see
Sect. 9.4 of [5].
Indeed, | ˆψ⟩could be the infamous  Schr¨odinger’s cat state. To discuss whether
the cat is dead or alive, the consistent historian adopts an orthonormal basis (or
a decomposition of the identity, see [5]) for which these terms make sense, and
computes probabilities. As | ˆψ⟩is a computational tool, it requires no physical inter-
pretation. One could instead adopt an orthonormal basis that includes | ˆψ⟩as one of
its elements, in which case it occurs with probability 1. But then it makes no sense
to ask whether the cat is dead or alive, since the corresponding quantum properties
are incompatible with | ˆψ⟩.
In order to describe a quantum system at more than two times it is necessary to
extend the Born rule to families of quantum histories. A history is simply a sequence
of quantum events represented by vectors – or, more generally, subspaces – of the
quantum Hilbert space at successive times. A family is a collection of mutually
exclusive histories, the quantum counterpart of the sample space of a stochastic pro-
cess in ordinary probability theory. Extending the Born rule is nontrivial because
assigning probabilities in a meaningful way requires a consistent family or frame-
work in which appropriate consistency (or  decoherence) conditions are satisﬁed.
Different consistent families may be incompatible with each other, in which case
they cannot be combined (single-framework rule), even though each one provides a

valid set of possibilities for describing the time development of the quantum system.
Rather than discussing the details, found in Chaps. 10 and 11 of [5], let us consider
a particular application.
The ﬁgure shows a Mach–Zehnder interferometer: B and B′ are beam splitters,
M and M′ mirrors, D and D′ detectors. Suppose the unitary time development of a
photon  wave packet passing through the interferometer has the (schematic) form
|a⟩→(|c⟩+ |d⟩)/
√
2 →|f ⟩. This history can be embodied in a family F1, which
remains consistent when extended to include the event that D′ is, and D is not,
triggered by the arrival of the photon. Within this family it makes no sense to ask
whether the photon passes through the c or d arm of the interferometer, for those
properties are incompatible with (|c⟩+|d⟩)/
√
2. There is a second consistent family
F2 in which the photon while inside the interferometer is either in the c arm or in
the d arm, two mutually exclusive possibilities. One can extend F2 to a consistent
family including later states of D and D′, but only by using macroscopic quantum
 superposition (Schr¨odinger cat states). Thus a “which arm?” description (F2)
precludes a “which detector?” description (F1), and vice versa. No fundamental
quantum principle singles out one of the two incompatible families F1 or F2 as
“the correct” description, just as there is no “correct” perspective from which to
photograph Mt. Rainier. Instead, certain descriptions are useful when addressing
certain physical questions. The same sort of analysis can be applied to the famous
 double-slit interference paradox; see Sect. 13.1 of [5].
Quantum measurements pose no difﬁculty in the consistent histories approach.
By adopting an appropriate framework one can show that the measurement out-
come (pointer position) for a properly constructed quantum-mechanical apparatus is
appropriately correlated with, and thus reveals, a property the microscopic system
possessed before the measurement took place. In brief, measurements actually mea-
sure something, as has long been believed by experimental physicists. See Chaps. 17
and 18 of [5] for details. In Chaps. 23 and 24 of [5] it is shown explicitly, by apply-
ing appropriate quantum principles, that the nonlocal inﬂuences sometimes thought
to arise in the Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen gedanken ( EPR) experiment are com-
pletely spurious: they come about from improperly assuming that “ wave function
collapse” is a physical process, rather than a mathematical technique for comput-
ing conditional probabilities that can be obtained by completely different methods.

This removes an apparent conﬂict with relativity theory. Indeed, the consistent his-
tories approach, unlike some other interpretations of quantum theory, is perfectly
compatible with special relativity [6]. A number of other quantum paradoxes can be
resolved or “tamed” in the sense that a consistent analysis is possible using quan-
tum principles, and one is able to identify the point(s) at which an improper use of
classical reasoning has led to an apparent contradiction. See Chaps. 19–25 of [5].
Here are brief comments on the relationship of consistent histories with some
other approaches to quantum interpretation. The connection with Copenhagen
(current textbooks) was discussed above. The Everett or  many-worlds
interpretation regards the  wave function of a closed system (“universe”) as
representing physical reality, whereas in consistent histories it is a mathematical
tool, | ˆψ⟩in the preceding discussion, useful for computing some but not all of
the probabilities of real histories.  Bohmian mechanics and consistent histories
contradict each other about what happens inside the box [7]. Because it solves the
Schr¨odinger cat problem in a completely different way, consistent histories has
no need of the nonunitary dynamics employed in spontaneous localization. Unlike
Bohmian mechanics and spontaneous localization, there is no conﬂict between con-
sistent histories and special relativity. Since it employs rules to delineate meaningful
descriptions, consistent histories is (or employs) a form of “ quantum logic” in the
sense of specifying rules for correct reasoning in the quantum domain. These rules
are, however, different from those employed in what is usually called  quantum
logic. See [8] for the relationship between consistent histories and the  Ithaca
interpretation of Mermin.

Correlations in Quantum Mechanics
Richard Healey
The statistical algorithm of quantum mechanics predicts that measurements will
reveal correlations among the values of magnitudes (“ observables”). Whenever
such measurements have been performed, they have borne out the predictions. But
the patterns exhibited by these correlations can be difﬁcult to square with classical
intuitions – about probability, about the nature and properties of quantum systems,
and about causal connections between systems.
In a  Hilbert space formulation, an observable is represented by a  self-adjoint
operator, while the state of a system is represented by a normalized vector (perhaps a
 wave function) or more generally a  density operator ˆW (a self-adjoint operator
with unit trace). If {O1, ..., On} is a set of observables on a system represented
by pairwise commuting operators { ˆO1, ..., ˆOn}, then quantum mechanics predicts
that measured values of all these observables in state ˆW will conform to a joint
probability distribution pr(O1 ∈1, ..., On ∈n) given by
pr(O1 ∈1, ..., On ∈n) = T r

where ˆOi(i) is the element of the spectral resolution of ˆOi corresponding to Borel
set i of possible values (i = 1, ..., n). If any two operators ˆOi, ˆOj in such a set
fail to commute, then no joint distribution is predicted.
For example, a simple quantum mechanical model of a Hydrogen atom  Bohr’s
atom model will predict a joint probability distribution for energy, total angular
momentum, and z-component of angular momentum in any state; but it will never
predict a joint probability distribution for energy, position and momentum, nor for
z-component and x-component of angular momentum.
