Abstract
The emergence of detailed maps of physical networks, like the brain connectome, vascular net-
works, or composite networks in metamaterials, whose nodes and links are physical entities, have
demonstrated the limits of the current network science toolset. Link physicality imposes a non-
crossing condition that affects both the evolution and the structure of a network, in a way that
the adjacency matrix alone – the starting point of all graph-based approaches – cannot capture.
Here, we introduce a meta-graph that helps us discover an exact mapping between linear physi-
cal networks and independent sets, a central concept in graph theory. The mapping allows us to
analytically derive both the onset of physical effects and the emergence of a jamming transition,
and show that physicality impacts the network structure even when the total volume of the links is
negligible. Finally, we construct the meta-graphs of several real physical networks, which allows us
to predict functional features, such as synapse formation in the brain connectome, that agree with
empirical data. Overall, our results show that, in order to understand the evolution and behavior
of real complex networks, the role of physicality must be fully quantified.

Physical networks, describing molecular and composite networks in metamaterials [1],
the hard-wiring of transistors in a computer chip, the brain connectome [2], or the vascular
system [3, 4], are networks whose nodes and links are physical entities with defined shape
and volume, that cannot cross each other [5, 6]. While network science offers a suite of tools
to quantify abstract networks, whose structure is fully defined by their adjacency matrix [7–
11], these tools are insufficient if we wish to account for the impact of physicality. Indeed,
physical networks differ from the abstract networks in two key aspects. First, the nodes and
links are embedded in a 3D Euclidean space, hence, similar to spatial networks [12, 13], we
must specify node positions and link routing. The second and the most defining feature of
physicality is volume exclusion, i.e., the fact that the nodes and the links are not allowed
to overlap [14, 15]. While recent experimental advances have provided increasingly accurate
maps of physical networks, we lack a formalism to expand the toolset of network science
to these systems, and understand how physicality affects the structure and the evolution of
physical networks.
Here we unveil the impact of physicality through the discovery of an exact mapping of a
physical network into the independent sets of a deterministic meta-graph [16], allowing us to
analytically predict the onset of physicality and the emergence of a jamming transition. The
formalism allows us to construct the meta-graph for real physical networks, and to predict
their functional features, like synapse formation in the brain.
LINEAR PHYSICAL NETWORK (LPN) MODEL
To understand the impact of physicality on network structure, we aim to construct the
simplest possible model that captures the role of volume exclusion. For this reason, we
eliminated all complexities that affect our ability to explore the role of volume exclusion,
like the curving of the links or the impact of the node volume, prompting us to focus on
linear physical networks (LPN), whose nodes are zero-volume points in the three-dimensional
space and links are straight cylinders with diameter λ.
To generate a random λ-physical network G(λ, P), we start from a random finite point set
P placed in R3. The points in P, that serve as nodes, are placed uniformly randomly within
2

the unit cube with the constraint that any two nodes must be at least at λ distance from
each other. To construct the network, we first choose two unconnected nodes in P at random
and connect them by a capped cylinder of thickness λ. If the cylinder does not cross any
preexisting link (except those connected to the two end nodes), we add it to the network;
if, however, the proposed link overlaps with a previously added link, we delete the proposed
link and select another random node pair to connect.
For λ = 0 we lack physical constraints, and any point pair can be connected by a link.
Consequently G(0, P) maps exactly into the Erd˝os-R´enyi model and leads to a fully connected
network at M = N(N −1)/2. For any λ > 0, however, physicality induces a jammed
state, implying that once we reach a maximal number of links Mmax(λ), no further links
can be added, without violating volume exclusion. To characterize the jamming process,
we measured ⟨l⟩, the average length of the successfully added links, for different λ values
(Figure 1e). For λ = 0 all links are accepted, hence the average length of the observed links
is lrs ≈0.662, which is the expected length of a randomly selected segment from the unit
cube (dashed line in Fig. 1e). For λ > 0 the link length ⟨l⟩deviates from lrs for large M,
indicating that long links often violate physicality, and the larger λ is, the earlier physicality
manifests itself.
As Fig. 1e indicates, both the onset of physicality (Mphys, that captures the moment at
which volume exclusion starts to play a role) and the jammed state (Mmax) decrease with
increasing link diameter λ. Although Mmax and Mphys are driven by random processes, we
find that their value obtained for multiple independent networks generated with the same
(λ, P) parameters is narrowly distributed (Fig. 1f,g), indicating that Mphys and Mmax are
self-averaging (Supplementary Information Sec. S3.2). Our goal, therefore, is to unveil the
processes that govern these variables, helping us understand the impact of physicality on the
network structure.
META-GRAPH AND INDEPENDENT SETS
To uncover the dependence of the onset of physicality (Mphys) and the jamming transition
(Mmax) on the link thickness λ and the number of nodes N = |P|, we introduce the meta-
3

graph M(P, λ), designed to capture the physical constraints among the link candidates. The
meta-graph has N(N −1)/2 vertices, each corresponding to a possible link (pi, pj) between
the N nodes. Two links (p1, p2) and (p3, p4), corresponding to two vertices of the meta-graph,
are connected if they violate physicality, i.e., if the distance between the line segments (p1, p2)
and (p3, p4) is below λ (Fig. 1a-d). Note that for a given point set P and link thickness λ
the construction of the meta-graph M(P, λ) is fully deterministic.
The value of the meta-graph stems from the discovery that any linear physical network
G(P, λ) corresponds to an independent set of vertices in M(P, λ) and vice versa. A set of
vertices is called independent if there are no edges between the elements of the set (Fig. 2a,b).
For example, each vertex of the meta-graph of Fig. 1b,d corresponds to a potential link of the
physical networks of Fig. 1a,c. The meta-vertices shown in red on Fig. 1b,d form independent
sets, as there are no direct edges between them. Therefore, each link in the physical network
that corresponds to a red meta-vertex can coexist with any other link corresponding to
another red meta-vertex, as they do not violate physicality.
Independent sets are extensively studied in combinatorics [16], computer science [17],
probability theory and statistical physics [18, 19]. The exact mapping between a λ-physical
network G(P, λ) and the independent vertex sets of the M(P, λ) is our key result that, as we
show next, allows us to develop an analytically solvable formalism to explore the structure
and the evolution of physical networks.
PREDICTING THE EVOLUTION OF PHYSICAL NETWORKS
We rely on the mapping between λ-physical networks and the independent sets of meta-
graphs to derive Mphys and Mmax, and understand the role of physicality. We must account
for two limits as we proceed: (i) With fixed λ we cannot take the large network limit (N →
∞) because the total volume of the links, whose lower-bound scales as Nλ3 for networks
with non-vanishing average degree, exceeds the available volume for large N, resulting in
a disconnected network. We therefore must decrease λ as we increase N to ensure that
λ ≲N −1/3. (ii) If λ decreases too fast with N, the average meta-degree ⟨kmeta⟩
∼λN 2
(Supplementary Information Sec. S1.4) converges to zero and physicality will stop playing a
4

role, implying that λ ≳N −2. To satisfy (i) and (ii), we set
λ = C
N α,
(1)
where C is an arbitrary constant and the control parameter α interpolates between the
crowded state (i, α = 1/3) and the loss of physicality (ii, α = 2).
We begin by observing that the construction of a random LPN is equivalent to building a
greedy independent set I of M(P, λ) by sequentially selecting the meta-vertices in random
order and adding the tth meta-vertex to I if none of its neighbors are in I. To analytically
characterize this process, we introduce a randomized reference meta-graph Mrr(P, λ) in
which two link candidates with length l1 and l2 are connected independently with probability
(π/2)λl1l2, representing the approximate probability that the distance between two randomly
selected segments of lengths l1 and l2 is at most λ. This construction provides a first order
approximation of M(P, λ) in λ: the expected degree of a vertex with length l is ∼λl
in both M(P, λ) and Mrr(P, λ) in leading order, while higher-order structures, such as the
number of triangles a vertex participates in, are not captured by Mrr(P, λ). We then leverage
Mrr(P, λ) to derive a differential equation that governs the temporal evolution of the total
length Ltotal(t) of links in I [20] (Supplementary Information Sec. S3)

is the probability that a meta-vertex
with length l has no connections leading to the independent set I at τ. This means that
the acceptance of link candidates decays exponentially with l, suggesting that p(l), the
distribution of the length of the accepted links, also decays exponentially, in line with results
on brain architecture finding an exponential law [21, 22]. The total link length Ltotal(τ),
however, increases over time, meaning that longer links are added earlier during the evolution
of the network than in later stages. In fact, we predict that this source of heterogeneity leads
to a power law link length distribution p(l) ∼l−3 with an upper cutoff dictated by the finite
size of the system (Supplementary Information Sec. S4).

The onset of physicality happens when link candidates get rejected with positive proba-
bility, i.e., λLtotal(τ) →const. for N →∞, predicting
Mphys ∼N α,
(3)
unveiling that the control parameter α directly governs the onset of physicality Mphys. Equa-
tion (2) also predicts that the jamming point scales as
Mmax ∼N
3α+4
5 ,
(4)
and the total link length in the jammed state scales as
Ltotal ∼N
4α+2
5 .
(5)
Equation (2) also allows us to study the fluctuations of these quantities, yielding that
their variances scale as σ2(Mphys) ∼N α, σ2
2 (Mmax) ∼N
3α+4
5
and σ2 (Ltotal) ∼N α ln N.
Consequently, in the large network limit the typical fluctuations converge to zero compared
to their expectation; indicating that Eqs. (3)-(5) correctly capture the typical behavior of
LPNs.
Our analytical predictions are directly testable by simulations. We begin by numerically
solving Eq. (2) to determine the dependence of Mmax on λ (Fig. 2c), finding excellent agree-
ment, particularly for small λ. We next tested the predicted scaling behavior (3)-(5) by
constructing LPNs of increasing sizes, finding that they offer an accurate description of the
onset of physicality (Figs. 2c-e). The predictive accuracy of Eq. (2) indicates that the likeli-
hood of adding a physical link to the network is driven primarily by the length of the link,
hence higher order effects, like the formation of triangles, that are ignored by Mrr(P, λ),
play a negligible role.
Figure 2g summarizes the behavior of physical networks as predicted by Eqs. (2-5), doc-
umenting the vanishing role of physicality with increasing α:
For α < 1/3 the link widths are larger than the typical distance between adjacent nodes,
hence the network remains disconnected. The first realizable network emerges for α = 1/3,
in which case Eq. (3) predicts Mphys ∼N 1/3, meaning that physicality plays a role even
when the network is ultra sparse (⟨k⟩= 2Mphys/N ∼N −2/3 →0). For α = 1/3, we have
6

Mmax ∼N, indicating that the jammed network is also sparse (⟨k⟩= O(1)). The link length
in the jammed network l∗∼Ltotal/Mmax is of the order of the distance between physically
adjacent nodes ∼N −1/3.
Between 1/3 ≤α ≤2, we are in the physical regime, with two sub-regimes: In the sub-
linear regime (1/3 < α ≤1), physicality plays a role even in sparse networks (⟨k⟩= O(1)). In
contrast, in the super-linear regime (1 < α ≤2) sparse LPNs are not affected by physicality,
hence we need a super-linear number of links before physicality affects network formation.
Finally, for α = 2, the onset of physicality scales as Mphys ∼N 2, and Mmax ∼N 2, meaning
that physical interactions are only important in dense networks. The average physical link
length ⟨l⟩in this regime is of the order of the system size, indicating the links can span the
entire system, a consequence of the vanishing role of physical effects.
THE ADJACENCY MATRIX IN THE JAMMED STATE IS PREDICTIVE OF
NODE POSITIONS
A key prediction of our formalism is that physicality impacts the structure of networks
even with vanishing volume. Indeed, according to (5), the network volume scales as V ∼
λ2Ltotal ∼N −6α−2
5 , hence in the N →∞limit for any α > 1/3 the jammed network occupies
a zero fraction of the available space.
As the number of links increases, so does the number of physical constraints that each
new link must satisfy. Hence our ability to place a new link becomes increasingly dependent
on the existing links, which in turn leads to correlations between the adjacency matrix and
the physical layout of the network. Indeed, before physicality turns on (M < Mphys), the
distribution of eigenvalues follows Wigner’s semicircle law (Fig. 3a)[23]. When, however, the
number of links M approaches the jammed state Mmax, three additional eigenvalues µ2, µ3
and µ4 separate from the bulk (Fig. 3b). In non-physical networks, such eigenvalues often
indicate the presence of a large-scale organization in the network, for example, leading eigen-
vectors may correspond to a macroscopic community structure [24]. In contrast, in physical
networks the leading eigenvectors are induced by physicality, signaling a strong spatial de-
pendence: the typical link length l∗∼Ltotal/Mmax ∼N −2−α
5
decreases with increasing N and
7

nodes are densely connected in their l∗neighborhood, while the majority of long-range links
are suppressed. The resulting large-scale three-dimensional spatial organization is captured
by the eigenvalues µ2, µ3 and µ4 and the corresponding eigenvectors v(2), v(3) and v(4): the
eigenvectors at node i become strongly correlated with the spatial coordinates of i. In other
words, as we approach the jammed state, the adjacency matrix becomes predictive of the
position of individual nodes. To quantify the predictive power of the leading eigenvectors,
we rotate v(2), v(3) and v(4) to best align with the node coordinates and calculate the coeffi-
cient of determination, i.e., we measure how well (v(2)
i , v(3)
i , v(4)
i ), the eigenvectors at node i,
predict its coordinates (xi, yi, zi) (Supplementary Information Sec. S5.3). We find that the
coefficient of determination increases rapidly as we approach the jammed state, indicating
that the node positions predicted by the adjacency matrix converge towards their true val-
ues (Fig. 3c,d). In other words, while a complete description of physical networks requires
simultaneous information on the adjacency matrix, link routing and node layout, we find
that unexpectedly in the jammed state, where physicality is the strongest, these features
become so intertwined, that the adjacency matrix alone offers a complete description of the
system. Note that having reduced space around nodes does not by itself imply predictability:
for example, the adjacency matrix of a densely packed tree does not carry any information
about the physical location of the nodes, as such networks can be folded into a volume in
many different ways, changing the layout but preserving the abstract network.
THE META-GRAPH OF REAL NETWORKS
While the LPN model conceptualizes physical networks as nodes connected by straight
links, in real physical networks, like the brain connectome or the vascular network, the links
curve. As we show next, the meta-graph offers a quantitative framework to characterize the
impact of physicality for networks with arbitrary link shapes and structure.
In their native state, neurons in the brain or the vessels of a vascular network obey
volume exclusion. If, however, we increase the thickness λ of all links by a ∆λ, conflicts can
emerge. We therefore defined a generalized meta-graph Mg(∆λ), in which we connect two
vertices of the meta-graph if the corresponding physical objects (links or nodes) overlap for a
8

given ∆λ, concisely capturing the spatial organization of a physical network (Supplementary
Information Sec. S7).
We constructed Mg(∆λ) for multiple real physical networks, including the fruit fly’s
brain [2], the vascular network of a mouse [4] and a mitochondrial network [25]. We illustrate
the process in Fig. 4a, which shows the meta-graph of the fruit fly connectome, consisting
of N = 2, 970 neurons and M = 35, 707 synapses serving as links.
According to Peter’s rule, neurons can only form synapses if their axons and dendrites are
in close physical proximity [26, 27]. Hence we expect and find a strong correlation between
the meta-degree and the number of synapses (Supplementary Information Fig. S21). To
abstract from these obvious correlations between the generalized meta-graph and synapse
formation, we focus only on conflicts between neurons that are not connected by synapses
and therefore are the result of the packing of the neurons in the brain. We achieve this by
building a restricted meta-graph, where we remove the synaptically connected links from the
meta-graph. Figure 4a highlights the vertex with the highest restricted meta-graph degree
kA = 13, corresponding to the most physically confined neuron, bordered by 13 other neurons
that it does not synapse with (Fig. 4b,c). This prompts the question: Is the most confined
neuron also the most central in the synaptic network? To find an answer, we performed a
linear regression between the restricted meta-degree and the logarithm of synapses, revealing
a positive association between the physical confinement and the functional role of neurons
(Fig. 4d, slope a = 0.356±0.022 and R2 = 0.26). Our result indicates that synaptically central
neurons in the connectome are tightly confined in the brain by non-synaptic partners. This is
non-obvious, as we can construct physical networks that have negative correlations between
the number of synapses and the restricted meta-degree: consider a physical network with N
nodes where each neuron is physically adjacent to all N −1 other neurons (Supplementary
Information Fig. S23). If a neuron i has k synaptic partners, it has N −1 −k meta-degree,
resulting in a perfect anticorrelation between the number of synapses and the meta-degree.
Overall, the observed correlations confirm that the meta-graph captures important properties
of the physical layout and can be used to systematically study the connection between
physical and abstract network structure.
As connectome mapping aspires to scale up to the 109 neurons of the human brain, new
9

mathematical and computational formalisms, like the one offered by the meta-graph, are
needed to unveil the predictive power of these exceptionally large physical network maps.
Full description of the layout of a physical network requires copious amounts of data that
is difficult to handle computationally and also limits analytical advances. For example the
Hemibrain dataset describes the 3D trajectory of approximately 25,000 neurons of a fruit fly
using 117 million linear segments [2]. Na¨ıve identification of physical conflicts, therefore, re-
quires 1016 distance computations, a prohibitive computational burden for most researchers.
In contrast, the 25, 000×25, 000 adjacency matrix of the generalized meta-graph can be rep-
resented using a few hundred MB of data, hence publishing it together with the adjacency
of the connectome would allow the computationally efficient study of the relation between
physical and abstract network structure.
DISCUSSION
Recent experimental advances, driven by connectomics and high resolution MRI, have
offered detailed and accurate maps of a wide range of physical networks, from the structure of
individual neurons in a brain, to 3D maps of large vascular systems. These advances unveiled
an important gap in network science: the lack of understanding of how physicality affects the
network structure. The need for a quantitative and conceptual framework go beyond biology:
complex metamaterials, combining random and repetitive local structures [1, 28, 29], offer
other manifestations of physical networks, and so do computer chips that pack billions of
transistors. Here we introduced a formalism designed to systematically explore the structure
of physical networks. We show that the impact of physicality is not limited to dense networks
– to the contrary, in their jammed state physical networks are sparse, with the relative
volume of their links converging to zero for large systems. In other words, physicality is
not a simple manifestation of crowding, but has subtle and nontrivial consequences on the
network structure. The advances presented here raise multiple open questions, many of which
can be addressed using meta-graphs. For example, many real networks are characterized
by non-uniform node density, heterogeneous link diameters, bent links, and are potentially
affected by the order the nodes and the links are added to the network. The impact of these
10

features can be studied by extending the random LPN model or using the generalized meta-
graphs. These variants of LPNs may serve as null models to understand the features of the
physical layout and network structure of real systems (Supplementary Information Sec. S7.6).
Other issues are less straightforward extensions of our work, but may benefit from the meta-
graph framework, such as understanding the effect of the physical architectures on network
robustness [30, 31] or on dynamics on networks [32–36].
A quantitative understanding of physicality can directly impact multiple areas of science.
For example, at this point it is unclear to what degree the observed brain connectomes are
driven by the genetic processes that govern their developmental biology [37], or by physical
constraints that the neurons and their interactions must obey, limiting a neuron’s ability to
synapse with desired target neurons in a very dense environment. Answers require a modeling
and analytical platform that helps us systematically explore the competing role of genetics
and physicality.

FIG. 1. Linear Physical Networks (LPN) (a,c) A linear physical network (LPN) with eight
nodes, showing its structure for two different λ values. While for the small λ in (a) most links
are allowed, for λ = 0.2 in (b) many links are forbidden, as they would overlap with other links.
(b,d) The 28 vertices of the meta-graph represent the candidate links of the physical network,
each labeled by the node numbers they attempt to connect. Two vertices are connected if the
corresponding links overlap, hence they cannot coexist in a physical network. Each independent
vertex set of these meta-graphs corresponds to a valid physical network: the independent set formed
by the red nodes represent the physical network shown in (a,c). (e-g) To model the evolution of a
LPN, we generate a point set P with N = 300 nodes, randomly adding links if they do not violate
λ-physicality, repeating the process 1000 times for the same P. (e) The observed length of the
links after the addition of M links. The data points are logarithmically spaced, and the dashed
line corresponds to lrs ≈0.662, the expected length of a random segment chosen from the unit
cube (expected for λ = 0). The higher the λ, the more conflicts links have, hence the more the
observed l deviates from lrs. Error bars representing the SEM are smaller than the marker size.
(f,g) Histogram of Mphys and Mmax for different realizations, showing that Mphys and Mmax are
concentrated on a narrow range, being largely independent of the order the links are added. Due to
the logarithmic scale the histograms for low Mphys and Mmax appear to be wider. In simulations,
we measure Mphys as the number of links above which at least 1/6th of the link candidates are
rejected. (Supplementary Information Sec. S1.5.5)

FIG. 2. Meta-graph and Independent Sets. (a) The purple and green vertices of the meta-
graph have no direct edges between them, forming an independent set, indicating that the corre-
sponding physical links (p1, p2) and (p3, p4) are non-overlapping (conflict free). (b) The purple and
yellow vertices do not form an independent set, as they are connected by a direct edge, indicating
that the physical links corresponding to them overlap, hence they cannot be added simultaneously.
(c-g) To test the analytical predictions provided by the meta-graph, we simulated LPNs and nu-
merically measured the number of links at the onset of physicality (Mphys), the maximal number of
links (Mmax), and their length (Ltot) in the jammed state. (c) Comparing the prediction of Eq. (2)
with the numerical estimate of Mmax from simulations of LPNs with N = 200. Markers represent
the average of 50 independent networks, the error bars representing the SEM are smaller than the
marker size. (d-f) We generated LPNs with increasing N and link thickness scaling as λ = C/Nα.
The symbols indicate the numerical results and the slope of the continuous lines correspond to the
scaling exponents predicted by Eqs. (3)-(5). The data points represent an average of 10 independent
runs, and the error bars representing the SEM are typically smaller than the marker size. (g) The
behavior of physical networks in function of α. For α < 1/3 the links are wider than the typical
distance between physically adjacent nodes, leading to disconnected physical networks with zero
average degree in the N →∞limit. In contrast, for α > 2 the role of physicality vanishes. Between
these two limits, physicality effects the formation of networks with more than Mphys ∼Nα links.
For 1/3 ≤α ≤1 physicality turns on after the addition of a sub-linear number of links and there-
fore even sparse networks (M ∼N) are affected by physicality. In contrast, for 1 ≤α ≤2 volume
exclusion has an effect only after the addition of a super-linear number of links, hence only dense
networks are affected by physicality. Overall, the role of physicality weakens for increasing α.

FIG. 3. Predicting Node Positions in the Jammed State. (a) The spectral density of the
adjacency matrix for N = 300 and λ = 1/N after the addition of M = 1000 links (blue). Before
the onset of physicality the eigenvalues of the LPN are consistent with an ER network of the same
size (red outline): the bulk of the spectral density is well approximated by Wigner’s semicircle law
(dashed line), and the largest eigenvalue separated from the bulk (µ1) corresponds to the average
degree of the network. (b) In the jammed state, the eigenspectrum of the LPN (green) deviates from
the spectrum of an ER network (red outline): three additional eigenvalues µ2, µ3 and µ4 become
separated from the bulk as a consequence of physical interactions. (c) Comparing the predicted
and the true x coordinate of each node shows that while for small link density the adjacency matrix
has no predictive power (blue symbols), the adjacency matrix can reliably predict the position of
nodes in the jammed state (green symbols). (d) The coefficient of determination R2 increases as
we add links to LPNs, indicating that as we approach the jammed state the predictive power of
the adjacency matrix increases. The circles highlight the R2 values corresponding to the λ shown
in (a) and (b). Subplots (a-c) show results for a single LPN, while (d) shows the average of 1000
independent networks.

FIG. 4. Meta-graph of Real Networks. (a) Each vertex of the restricted meta-graph represents
a neuron in the fruit fly connectome [2]. A link between two vertices of the restricted meta-graph
implies that the corresponding neurons overlap if we increase their thickness by ∆λ ≈0.028 but
they are not connected by synapses. The neuron with the highest restricted meta-degree, A, has 13
connections, while 1469 isolated vertices (not shown) correspond to neurons that are conflict-free
for ∆λ ≈0.028. (b) Neuron A (red) has the most excess confinement. We show it together with the
13 neurons that are within distance ∆λ of A, hence are connected to A in the restricted meta-graph
and highlighted in (a). The neuron colors match the colors of the meta-vertices in (a). (c) Neuron A
is an extended, physical object, whose physical conflicts with other neurons are localized in specific
neighborhoods of the physical network, highlighted in the figure. (d) The degree distribution of
the restricted meta-graph for ∆λ ≈0.028. Vertices with degree zero correspond to conflict-free
neurons, i.e., lack proximity within ∆λ with other neurons that are not connected to them via
synapses. Physically confined neurons have high restricted meta-degree, indicative of a large number
of physical conflicts. (e) The dependence of the restricted meta-degree on the number of synapses
of each neuron indicates that the restricted meta-degree is predictive of synapse formation. The
dashed line corresponds to linear regression between the restricted meta-degree and the logarithm of
the number of synapses for each neuron. Small markers represent individual neurons, large markers
are binned averages. For illustration purposes we chose ∆λ such that the meta-graph is sparse.
In Sec. S7 of the Supplementary Information we repeat the above analysis for various ∆λ values,
finding that the positive association between the restricted meta-graph and the synaptic network
is robust.

LINEAR PHYSICAL NETWORKS AND THE META-GRAPH
In this section we provide formal definitions for the objects and quantities that define
physical networks.
S1.1.
Linear physical networks
A linear physical network (LPN) is a network embedded in three-dimensional Euclidean
space such that each node in the network is a sphere and each link is a capped cylinder with
diameter λ. The nodes and links satisfy volume exclusion, meaning that they cannot overlap
in space. To avoid restricting the maximum node degree, we allow a node to overlap with
the links that are connected to it, and we allow links to overlap with each other if they share
an endpoint, leading to the following formal definition:
Definition S1.1. A λ-linear physical network (LPN) in its strictest sense is a graph G such
that the vertex set of G is a point set P ⊂R3 and the edges (p1, p2) ∈E ⊂P2 are straight
segments connecting these points, where P2 is every unordered pair formed of elements of
P. We require that the distance is at least λ between
(i) every point pair p1, p2 ∈P, with p1 ̸= p2 (node-node interaction);
(ii) every point p1 and every edge (p2, p3) ∈E, with {p1} ∩{p2, p3} = ∅(node-link interac-
tion);
(iii) every pair of edges (p1, p2), (p3, p4), respectively, with {p1, p2} ∩{p3, p4} = ∅(link-link
interaction).
We can define a more permissive version of the LPNs by relaxing some of the (i-iii)
conditions. In the main text, for example, we study LPNs with only (iii) link-link interactions,
offering a simpler exposition, while the behavior of key properties that we study, such as
scaling of the jammed state and the space-dependent eigenvectors, remain similar to the
strictest definition of LPNs, as we demonstrate in Secs. S2, S3, S4, S5 and S6.

S1.2.
Generating random LPNs
Here we define a random LPN model. We generate random LPNs in two stages: (i) we
place points p ∈P corresponding to nodes in R3 and then (ii) we connect unordered node
pairs (p, q) ∈P2 such that we ensure that we do not violate Def. S1.1. Throughout this paper
we place nodes randomly in the unit cube and node pairs are connected in random order.
Specifically, for node placement, if node-node interactions are ignored, i.e., we allow nodes
to overlap, the center of each node p ∈P is placed uniformly at random in the unit cube.
If node-node interactions are considered, nodes are placed one at time, always choosing
uniformly at random from positions at least λ distance away from the center of any existing
node. This process is equivalent to random sequential deposition (RSD) studied in the context
of hard-particle packings. It is known that the maximum density achievable via RSD is
ρ ≈0.38 [24], in our simulations we remain well below this limit. Higher node density is
achievable relying on non-random packings or simulated annealing-type algorithms [20].
For link placement, we randomly order the link candidates, i.e., every possible pair of nodes
(p, q) ∈P2. We then sequentially add them to the network if they do not violate physicality,
i.e., they do not be overlap with any already existing link and, if node-link interactions are
also considered, they do not overlap with any node other than their endpoints. We halt either
after the addition of a predefined number of links M or we continue until no more links can
be added.
Note that the definition of LPNs is more general than the random model introduced here,
other models, such as growing physical networks, are also possible.
S1.3.
Meta-graph
Here we define the meta-graph M(P, λ), which is an auxiliary graph that captures the
physical constraints between link candidates connecting point pairs (p, q) ∈P × P.
Definition S1.2. The meta-graph M(P, λ) is a graph defined for a λ > 0 and point set P,
such that
(i) the vertex set of M(P, λ) is the set of link candidates that do not overlap with nodes,
3

i.e.,
Vmeta = {(p, q) ∈P2 : d((p, q), r) ≥λ∀r ∈P \ {p, q}}
(ii) and the edges of M(P, λ) connect link candidates that overlap in space, i.e.,
Emeta = {((p, q), (r, s)) ∈Vmeta×Vmeta : d((p, q), (r, s))∀(r, s) ∈P×Pand{p, q}∩{r, s} = ∅}.
If link-node interaction is not considered, the vertex set of the meta-graph contains all
possible point pairs, i.e., Vmeta = (p, q) ∈P × P and Nmeta = N(N −1)/2, where Nmeta =
|Vmeta| and N = |P| .
S1.3.1.
Independent sets of the meta-graph and physical networks
Definition S1.3. Given a graph G(V, E) with vertex set V and edge set E, a subset of vertices
I ⊂V is independent if no two nodes in I are connected in G, i.e., ∀v, w ∈I (v, w) /∈E.
An independent set in the meta-graph represents to a conflict-free set of link candidates;
therefore there is a one-to-one correspondence between λ-linear physical networks on P and
independent sets in M(P, λ). Independent sets are extensively studied in graph combina-
torics, computer science, and physics [9, 19, 23].
Therefore mapping between independent sets and physical networks provides a range of
tools to characterize LPNs. For example, the random LPN generation introduced in Sec. S1.2
corresponds to the greedy maximal independent set construction. Similarly to the mapping
between LPNs and independent sets of the meta-graph, greedy independent sets were used
to study systems with volume exclusion in statistical physics and chemistry starting with
the work of Flory [4, 6].
S1.3.2.
Relation to the dual graph
The dual line graph is a somewhat similar but distinct concept from the meta-graph (Fig. S1).
The vertices of both the meta-graph and the line graph correspond to links in the original
4

network. The line graph, however, is associated to a realized network G, while the meta-
graph is associated to a physical point set P. Vertices of the line graph are links in G and
connections between them represent adjacency in the network G, i.e., they are connected
if their associated edges share endpoints in G. While the vertices of the meta-graph are all
possible links connecting points in P, and meta-edges represent physical proximity, i.e., two
meta-nodes are connected if they overlap and do not share endpoints.

Meta-graph
FIG. S1. Meta and line graphs. The meta and line graphs are somewhat similar concepts as both
meta-nodes and line graph-nodes represent links in the original network; however, the two graphs
capture different relationships between these links. The meta-nodes are physical link candidates and
the meta-links capture physical proximity: two meta-nodes are connected if the corresponding link
candidates overlap and do not share endpoints, such as (1,3) and (2,4) in the example. While the
nodes in the line graph are not link candidates but they represent links that are actually realized
in a network, and two are connected if they are adjacent in the abstract network, for example (1,3)
and (2,4) do not share endpoints and therefore are not connected in the line graph.

S1.4.
Large N limit and the α parameter
We are interested in the large network limit N →∞of LPNs. Increasing N while keeping
λ constant, however, is not possible, since the unit cube quickly fills up limiting the number
of physical nodes it can hold. Therefore, to obtain a useful thermodynamic limit, we must
decrease diameter λ while increasing N. To find the precise relationship between N and
λ that produces a non-trivial large network limit we estimate the average degree of the
meta-graph ⟨kmeta⟩as a function of N and λ.
S1.4.1.
Random link-link and node-link intersection
To estimate ⟨kmeta⟩, we first we calculate the probability that two randomly placed links
intersect. Assume that the links have lengths l1 and l2, respectively, diameter λ, a given
orientation, and that the links are rod-like, i.e., l1, l2 ≫λ. If we first place l1 in the available
volume, the excluded volume (i.e., the volume where we cannot place l2 without violating
physicality) in leading order of λ is provided by a parallelepiped with sides l1, l2 and 2λ,
meaning that
Vll, exc ∼λl1l2.
(S1)
The probability that the two links intersect is pll = Vll, exc/Vtotal, where in case of placing
links in the unit cube Vtotal = 1.
The excluded volume between a randomly placed node and a link with length l is simply
the volume of a capped cylinder with length l and diameter 2λ, meaning that
Vnl, exc ∼λ2l,
(S2)
in leading order of λ. The fact that Vll, exc ∼λ and Vnl, exc ∼λ2 hints at that as long as the
typical link length is much longer than the diameter, i.e., l∗≫λ, link-link interactions will
dominate over node-link interactions in the large network limit.

S1.4.2.
The number of vertices and edges in the meta-graph
By definition, if node-link interactions are taken into account, the vertex set of the meta-
graph is the set of physical link candidates that do not overlap with physical nodes. There
are N = |P| physical nodes; therefore the probability that a random link with length l does
not intersect with any nodes is
(1 −c · λ2l)N ≈exp(−cλ2lN),
(S3)
where c is a constant. There are ∼N 2 link candidates, therefore the total number of vertices
in the meta-graph is
Nmeta ∼N 2
Z
pLC(l) exp(−cλ2lN)dl,
(S4)
where pLC(l) is length distribution of the link candidates, and it is approximately equal to
the distribution of the length of a randomly selected segment in the unit cube, also known
as the cube line picking distribution [5, 15].
The probability that two physical link candidates with length l1 and l2 overlap is ∼λl1l2.
Since we have N 2
meta meta-vertex pairs, the number of edges in the meta-graph
Mmeta ∼λN 4
Z
pLC(l1) exp(−cλ2l1N)dl1
Z
pLC(l2) exp(−cλ2l2N)dl2,
(S5)
meaning that Mmeta grows linearly as a function of λ with an exponential cutoff around
λ ∼
√
N, a prediction supported by simulations.
If, as in the main text, we ignore node-link interactions, the exponential cutoff disappears,
leading to
Nmeta ∼N 2
(S6)
Mmeta ∼λN 4,
(S7)
meaning that the average meta-degree is ⟨kmeta⟩∼λN 2.
S1.4.3.
The α exponent
We now return to the question of how to take the N →∞limit. First note that if
λ ≲N −2,
(S8)
7

then the average meta-degree ⟨kmeta⟩∼λN 2 tends to zero, meaning that physicality will
have a diminishing effect and almost all links can be added to the physical network. On the
other hand if
λ ≳N −1/3,
(S9)
then the total volume of the nodes Vnodes ∼λ3N will exceed the total available volume. We
introduce the parameter α to interpolate between the two limiting cases:
λ = C · N −α.
(S10)
S1.4.4.
Asymptotic scaling of the average meta-degree
The definition of the α exponent ensures that the average meta-degree ⟨kmeta⟩remains
positive in the large network limit for α < 2. Equations (S4) and (S5) allow us to calculate
the asymptotic scaling of ⟨kmeta⟩for any α.
We start with calculating ⟨kmeta⟩for LPNs including node-link interactions. We found
in Eq. (S4) that for fixed N, the number of meta-vertices is constant with an exponential
cutoff at λ ∼N −1/2. The characteristic length of the exponential cutoff is (λ2N)−1 ∼N 2α−1.
For α > 1/2, this characteristic length tends to infinity in the large network limit, hence it
becomes irrelevant and Nmeta ∼N 2. For α < 1/2, however, the characteristic length tends
to zero and the exponential cutoff matters. For small l, the cube line picking distribution is
pLC(l) ∼l2, leading to Nmeta ∼N 6α−1. Therefore, if the LPN includes node-link interactions
the meta-graph has
Nmeta ∼





N 2
for α ≥1/2,
N 6α−1
for α < 1/2
(S11)
vertices.
Following similar considerations as for Nmeta, we find that in the N →∞limit the number
of meta-edges scales as
Mmeta ∼





N 4−α
for α ≥1/2,
N 11α−2
for α < 1/2.
(S12)
8

We obtain the scaling of the average meta-degree by combining Eqs. (S11) and (S12):
⟨kmeta⟩∼





N 2−α
for α ≥1/2,
N 5α−1
for α < 1/2.
(S13)
If, as in the main text, we only consider link-link interactions, the exponential cutoff in
Eqs. (S4) and (S5) disappears and relying on Eq. (S6) we obtain
⟨kmax⟩∼N 2−α.
(S14)
S1.5.
Onset of physicality and the jammed state
There are two central quantities that we study in the N →∞limit: the onset of physicality
and the jammed state. In the following we define these quantities and describe their relation
to similar concepts.
S1.5.1.
Onset of physicality
In the initial steps of adding links to an LPN, links are unlikely to get rejected due to
physical conflicts, while near the end of the process only a small portion are successfully
added (Fig. S2a). To characterize this transition between non-physical and physical stages,
we define the the onset of physicality Mphys as the number of links above which new links
are rejected with finite probability.
This definition, however, is only useful in the N →∞limit, since in finite systems link
rejection always happens with finite probability; therefore we are interested in the scaling of
Mphys for large N. In order to measure Mphys in finite simulations, we measure Mphys as the
number of links above which at least 1 −ϕ fraction of the links are rejected at any time, i.e.,
Mphys = max
M

M : t −M(t)
t
> 1 −ϕ
∀M(t) > M

,
(S15)
where t = 1, 2, . . . , N(N −1)/2 is the number of link candidates considered and M(t) is the
number of links successfully added upto time t.
9

S1.5.2.
Jammed state
We define the jammed state as an LPN with maximal number of links, i.e., a network
where no more links can be added without violating physicality. The jammed state depends
on the algorithm we use to add links to the network, in this paper we are interested in the
jammed state reached by adding links in random order (Sec. S1.2). The number of links
in this jammed state Mmax is not equal to the global maximum of M. To find the global
maximum, one can find the maximum independent set in the meta-graph. However, the
maximum independent set is an NP-complete problem in general graphs, suggesting that it
is also difficult to characterize in meta-graphs [11].
Note that jammed state of LPNs is related to, but distinct from the jammed states studied
in hard particle packings (HPP). In the latter, jammed states refer to maximal packings, such
that the particles touch, while maximal packings where there is a gap between the particles
are called saturated. Jammed and saturated states differ from each other in mechanical
properties, such as rigidity and response to stress [20]. The generation of LPNs is similar
to a classical hard rod packing problem with some important differences: (i) the length of
the links (or rods) is heterogeneous, (ii) not all rod positions are considered, only links that
connect a predefined set of nodes, and (iii) the links allow to overlap if they are connected
to the same node. In jammed LPNs, links typically do not touch unless they are connected
to the same node, similar to the saturated state in HPP. However, the fact that links are
connected to each other at their endpoints makes jammed LPNs similar to jammed HPP
with respect to some properties.
S1.6.
Behavior of LPNs
To illustrate the process of generating an LPN, we measure the expected link length after
the addition of M links as
⟨l(M)⟩= 1
M
X
i≤M
li,
(S16)
where li is the length of ith the link added to the network. Figure S2a shows ⟨l(M)⟩for
λ = N −2, N −1, N −0.5 and N −0.35 for LPNs including node-node, node-link and link-link

interactions, while Fig. 1g in the main text shows the same for LPNs with link-link interaction
only. Overall, we observe that ⟨l(M)⟩decreases as we add links to the network: as more links
are present the likelihood that long link candidates overlap with an existing link increases
and therefore get rejected increases, descreasing ⟨l(M)⟩. The process halts after the addition
of Mmax links, after which no more links can be added.
The key difference between LPNs with all physical interactions and LPNs with link-link
interactions that we observe is the onset of physicality Mphys, i.e., the M value where ⟨l(M)⟩
differs from the non-physical expectation. For LPNs with only link-link interactions, the
initial links are not affected by physicality and Mphys > 1 for any λ. However, including
node-link interactions can even affect the placement of the first link. Without physicality,
the typical link length of the first link is proportional to the side length of the cube, i.e.,
l ∼1. The probability that a link overlaps with a node is proportional to the volume of the
link ∼lλ2. Assuming that there are N nodes in the network and λ ∼N −α, the expected
number of nodes the first link overlaps with is
∼N · N −2α,
(S17)
meaning that if α > 1/2 physicality reduces the length of the first link in the N →∞limit,
i.e., Mphys = 1. We investigate the scaling of Mphys in more detail in Sec. S3.

length of two randomly selected points in the unit cube (dashed line). At the onset of physicality
Mphys the expected link length decreases compared to this random expectation. For α = 0.5 and

RIGOROUS LOWER BOUNDS ON Mmax
The mapping between λ-physical networks and the independent sets of the meta-graph
introduced in Sec. S1.3 allows us to formulate simple rigorous lower bounds for Mmax. A
point set P is in one-to-one correspondence with an independent set of M(P, λ). Adding
edges to the physical network in random order is equivalent to building independent sets
using the following randomized greedy algorithm: Let G = (V, E) be an abstract graph. If an
ordering σ is given on the vertices of G then there is a corresponding independent set Iσ in
G which is produced in a recursive way. The vertex with the smallest index is automatically
included in Iσ. We make a decision for each vertex in the order σ. Assume that this decision
has been made up to index i. Then we include v ∈V with σ(v) = i + 1 in Iσ if and only if
no neighbor of v with smaller index is included.
It is known that for any graph the expected size of the independent set has the lower
bound
E(|Iσ|) ≥
X
v∈V
1
kv + 1,
(S18)
where kv is the degree of v and · denotes expectation. The expected maximum number of
physical links in G(P, λ) is equal to the expected size of independent sets in M(P, λ). Thus
we have
E(Mmax) ≥

e∈M(λ,P)

(S19)

(S20)
where ke is the meta-degree of link candidate e, and the second inequality is Jensen’s inequal-
ity. Figure S3a compares the actual Mmax to the lower bounds, all measured on numerically
generated meta-graphs. We have to restrict ourselves to networks of at most a few hundred
nodes for which we can build the meta-graph explicitly. For these networks we find that
both lower bounds are the tightest for very dense and sparse physical networks; however,
for intermediate values the bounds are rather poor, and both significantly contribute to
underestimating Mmax.
Does the lower bound become tight for large networks? To find an answer we explore the
13

scaling of the lower bound in the N →∞limit setting λ = N −α. In Sec. S1.4, we derived the
asymptotic scaling of Nmeta and ⟨kmeta⟩, substituting into the lower bound (S20) provides
the scaling of Mmax. For both strict LPNs with node-link and link-link interactions and the
more permissive LPNs with only link-link interactions, we obtain
E(Mmax) ≳





N 2
for α ≥2,
N α
for α < 2
.
(S21)
The fact that the asymptotic behavior of the lower bound does not depend on the presence
of node-link interactions hints that such interactions become irrelevant to the jammed state
in the large network limit. To compare the predicted scaling of the lower bound, we generate
networks with increasing N while keeping λN α constant, this ensures that λ remains on
the order of N −α. Figure S3b shows that for α < 2 the bound is not tight and provides
apparently inaccurate scaling.

Lower bounds for Mmax. (a) We numerically generate LPNs in the jammed state
for various λ and we measure Mmax together with its lower bounds provided by Eqs. (S19) and
(S20). We find that the lower bounds typically underestimate the order of magnitude of Mmax. Both
bounds are the tightest for small λ. The markers represent the average of 10 independent LPNs
with N = 200 nodes. (b) We compare the scaling of the lower bound provided by Eq. (S21) to the
numerical measurements of Mmax with varying N and setting λ = N−α. Finite size simulations
suggest that, with the exception of α = 2, the lower bounds do not capture the asymptotic scaling
of Mmax in the large network limit.

RANDOM INDEPENDENT SETS
In this section we calculate nIS the expected fraction of vertices in the maximal greedy
independent set (IS) for a class of random networks relying on a differential equation for-
malism [2, 12], the fraction nIS = NIS/N is also known as the expected greedy independence
ratio or jamming ratio [5, 12].
More specifically we consider networks with N vertices such that each vertex pair (u, v)
is connected independently with probability
p(u, v) = wuwv,
(S22)
where wv is a prescribed weight of vertex v, either provided by a deterministic sequence or
drawn from some distribution p(w). The expected degree of vertex v is therefore E(k(v)) =
wv
P
u̸=v wu or E(k(v)) = wv
R
wp(w)dw.
The randomized greedy construction of ISs works by placing the nodes in a random order
σ, then sequentially in this order adding them to the IS whenever possible. Meaning that we
can add the tth node to the independent set if none of its neighbors have been added to the
IS before t, the probability of this is
P(t ∈Iσ) =
Y
s<t,s∈Iσ
(1 −wtws) ≈exp

log(1 −wtwu) = −

,
(S24)
and we introduced WIS(t), the total weight of nodes in the IS before t.
To obtain the time evolution of WIS(t), we substitute it with its expectation value over
all possible σ orders:
WIS(t + 1) = WIS(t) +
Z
w exp(−wWIS(t))p(w)dw,
(S25)
with initial condition WIS(0) = 0. Similarly the expected number of nodes in the IS before t
is given by
NIS(t + 1) = NIS(t) +
Z
exp(−wWIS(t))p(w)dw,
(S26)
16

with initial condition NIS(0) = 0. The final expected size of the IS is
|Iσ| = NIS(N).
(S27)
It can be useful to transform the equations by taking the continuous time limit using τ = t/N:

Approximating the meta-graph
The equations derived in this section allow us to analytically estimate Mmax, the maximum
number of edges that we can randomly add to a λ-physical network. The approach is that
18

we approximately model the meta-graph with a random graph where the probability that
two meta-nodes are connected is equal to the probability that two random segments of the
same length are at most λ distance from each other; therefore, the connection probability
only depends on the length of the corresponding link candidates (Fig. S5).
The probability that two randomly chosen segments in the unit cube are at most λ
distance from each other is approximately
π
2 λl1l2,
(S36)
where l1 and l2 are the lengths of the segments and the approximation ignores boundary
effects and the inhomogeneity of the unit cube. Therefore, to approximate the meta-graph,
we choose
wv = lv
rπ
2 λ.
(S37)
To calculate Mmax = NIS, we need to know p(w) or equivalently the length distribution of
the link candidates pLC(l). The distribution pLC(l) for large N converges to the distribution
of the distance between two randomly selected points from unit cube, sometimes called cube
line picking. The cube line picking has a known explicit, although complicated form, and its
mean is ⟨l⟩≈0.662 is the Robbins constant.
For LPNs with node-link interactions, a point pair is included as a node in the meta-graph,
if the segment connecting the two points is at least λ distance away from all other points.
Equation (S3) shows that the probability that a segment with length l is at least λ distance
away from N −2 ≈N random points in the unit cube is approximately exp(−πlλ2N). Using
these observations we adopt Eq. (S28) to calculate LIS(τ), the total length of the meta-nodes
in the independent set:

Randomized reference meta-graph. The randomized reference graph can be in-
terpreted as a meanfield version of the original meta-graph such that the length of the links are
preserved. The reference graph is defined on the same set of nodes as the meta-graph but two
nodes are connected with the probability equal to the probability of two randomly placed links
intersecting with the same length.
For LPNs with only link-link interactions, the second term in the exponent of Eqs. (S38)
and (S39) is left out.
To test the accuracy of the theoretical approximation, we simulate LPNs with only link-
link interactions with N = 1000 nodes and compare the numerically observed time evolution
of LIS(t) and NIS(t) to the predictions of Eqs. (S38) and (S39). Figure S6 shows that despite
the random approximation of the meta-graph, the theory well approximates LIS(t) and NIS(t)
and accurately captures their order of magnitude.
In the following we extract the asymptotic scaling of the onset of physicality Mphys and
the jammed state Mmax in the N →∞limit while setting λ = N −α.
S3.1.1.
Onset of physicality
In Sec. S1.5.1, we defined Mphys in the large network limit as the number of links above
which physical links get rejected with finite probability. As long as M(t) < Mphys all links
get accepted, meaning that M(t) = t (where t = τN 2/2) and the typical link length is of

LIS(t) and NIS(t) to the theoretical prediction of Eqs. (S38) and (S39), and we find that despite
the random approximation of the meta-graph, the theory describes the simulations well on a log
scale.
the order of the size of the unit cube, i.e., ⟨l(t)⟩∼1. For links to get rejected with finite
probability, the exponent in Eq. (S38) must not converge to zero at M(t) = Mphys as N →∞.
The exponent has two terms, the first ∼λLISl corresponds to link-link interactions and the
second ∼λ2Nl to node-link interactions. The longest links are the most likely to get rejected;
therefore we investigate the convergence of these two terms for l ∼1.
If α ≤1/2, the node-link interaction term
λ2N ∼N 1−2α
(S40)
becomes non-zero in the large network limit. This means that long links are rejected due
to overlap with isolated nodes already at the beginning of the generation of the LPN, and
Mmax = 1.
If α > 1/2, the node-link interaction term becomes irrelevant and the link-link interaction
term
λLIS ∼N −αMmax
(S41)
21

dominates, which becomes non-zero in the large network limit after the addition of Mmax ∼
N α links.
In summary, for LPNs with both node-link and link-link interactions the onset of physi-
cality happens at
Mphys ∼

(S42)
For LPNs with only link-link interactions only, the node-link interaction term is missing and
the onset of physicality happens at
Mphys ∼N α
(S43)
for any α.
To test the predicted scaling, we generate LPNs with increasing N while setting λ = N −α
and we measure Mphys(N) using the definition (S15). Figure S7a compares the numerical
measurements of Mphys(N) to the predicted scaling for LPNs with both node-link and link-
link interactions, while Fig. 2d in the main text compares it for LPNs with only link-link
interactions. For both cases, we find that simulations are consistent with the predictions.
S3.1.2.
The jammed state
We reach the jammed state after we exhausted all link candidates corresponding to time
τ = 1. Therefore, to calculate the asymptotic scaling of number of links in the jammed state
Mmax, we need to solve Eqs. (S38) and (S39) at τ = 1 for large N. First we assume that for
large N
π
2 λLIS(τ) ≫πλ2N = πN 1−2α,
(S44)
this clearly holds for α > 1/2, for α ≤1/2 we have to check the results for consistency. Our
second assumption is that as N increases LIS(τ) →∞also; and therefore the typical length
l of the segments that are added to the independent set tend to zero over time, this is useful
since as l →0 the segment length distribution becomes pLC(l) →4πl2. Substituting this into
Eq. (S38), we obtain

The integrand is sharply peaked at low l; we can, therefore, extend the upper bound of

therefore the total length of the independent set at τ = 1 is

(S48)
Note that for large N the inequality
λLIS ∼N (2−α)/5 > N 1−2α
(S49)
holds for α > 1/3; therefore the result is consistent with our initial assumptions for all
possible α values. This means that node-link interactions become irrelevant compared to
link-link interactions in the large network limit N →∞.
Similarly the number of meta-nodes in the independent set NIS (or equivalently the max-
imal number of links in the physical network Mmax) is
NIS ∼N

(S50)
To test the predicted scaling, we generate jammed LPNs with increasing N while setting
λ = N −α and we measure the number of links NIS = Mmax and the total length of the links
LIS = Ltotal. Figures S7b,c compare the numerical measurements to the predicted scaling
for LPNs with both node-link and link-link interactions, while Figs. 2e,f in the main text
compare it for LPNs with only link-link interactions. For both cases, we find that simulations
are consistent with the predictions.
Figure S8 summaries the possible asymptotic behavior of the LPNs with only link-link
interactions.

with their scaling predicted by theory in the large network limit. (a) For the onset of physicality,
Equation (S42) predicts that for α ≤1/2 node-link interactions affect the placement of the first
links, i.e., Mmax = 1. While for α > 1/2, link-link interactions dominate and we predict the same
scaling as in LPNs with only link-link interactions. (b,c) Theory predicts that in the jammed state
link-link interactions are the dominant physical interactions for any α > 1/3, and we predict the
same scaling as in LPNs with only link-link interactions. Markers represent the average of 10 in-
dependently generated networks and the errorbars indicate the standard error of the mean. The
slope of the solid lines corresponds to the predicted scaling exponent and the intercept is chosen
by fitting the predicted scaling to the final 20% of the data points.

average degree remains constant and the network is sparse, for β > 1 the average degree diverges,
and M ∼N2 represents the dense limit, where ⟨k⟩∼N. For β < 1, the average degree tends to
0, meaning that in the N →∞limit almost all nodes are isolated. (c) The effect of physicality
depends on the physicality parameter λ = N−α and the number of links added to the network. If
M ≲Mphys ∼Nα, than link-link physical interactions do not effect the evolution of the network,
and physicality affects the global properties of the network only above Mphys (blue area). We reach
the jammed state at Mmax ∼N

M ≳Mmax (orange area). (d) If α = 1/3 the jammed state is sparse and networks with even
⟨k⟩→0 are affected by physicality. (e) If α = 2, the scaling of both Mphys and Mmax coincide with
the dense network limit.

S3.2.
Fluctuations of Mphys, Mmax and Ltotal
The quantities Mmax, Mphys and Ltotal are affected by multiple random processes, such as
the random positions of the P point set and the random order which we select the links for
inclusion, and this complex dependence on the history of the network may to lead to non-
self-averaging properties. The analytical solution developed in Sec. S3 relies on substituting
Ltotal with its expectation. The fact that the analytical predictions well approximate the
numerical results suggests that Mphys, Mmax and Ltotal are concentrated on their expectation
values. To provide further support for this, we derive the scaling of the variances of these
quantities with network size N for LPNs with link-link interactions.
S3.2.1.
Onset of physicality
Section S1.5.1 defines the onset of physicality Mphys for finite size networks as the number
of links above which at least 1 −ϕ fraction of the link candidates where rejected. Here we
estimate the scaling of σ2(Mphys), i.e., the scaling of the variance of the numerically measured
Mphys. The probability of a link candidate with length l to get accepted at time t is
p(l, t) = exp
h
−π
2 λLIS(t)l
i
.
(S51)
Before the onset of physicality all link candidates are accepted, meaning that the number of
accepted links is equal to t (i.e., M(t) = t) and the total length is LIS(t) = ⟨l⟩· M(t), where
⟨l⟩is the average length of a random segment in the unit cube. The typical length of links
near the onset of physicality is on the scale of the available volume; therefore probability of
accepting a link candidate at t becomes approximately
p(M) ≈exp[−cλM],
(S52)
where c is a constant and M is the number of accepted links. When we measure Mphys we are
in effect measuring p(M), and Mphys is found if the estimated ¯p(M) falls below a predefined
threshold ϕ. However, we can only estimate p(M), i.e., we can only determine it up to an
error ¯p(M) = p(M) ± σ(p). The onset of physicality is then determined by
ϕ = exp[−cλMphys] ± σp.
(S53)

Solving for Mphys and keeping only first order terms of σp, we obtain
Mphys = ln(ϕ−1)

(S55)
where n is the sample size. In our case the sample size is on the scale of the number of links
added to the network, i.e., n ∼Mphys ∼N α; therefore
σp ∼N −α/2.
(S56)
From Eqs. (S54) and (S56) we obtain that the variance of Mphys scales as

Jammed state
The total link length Ltotal is the sum of the length of the links l(t) added at each time
step, where l(t) is a random variable depending on Ltotal(t), and l(t) = 0 indicates that no
link was added at t. Throughout our derivation we assume that consecutive l(t) variables only
depend on Ltotal(t) and are otherwise independent of each other. Under the same assumption
the variance of the sum of the link lengths σ2 (Ltotal) is equal to the sum of the variances of
l(t). We separate the contribution of the link candidates to σ2 (Ltotal) into two terms
σ2 (Ltotal) = σ2
1 (Ltotal) + σ2
2 (Ltotal) ,
(S58)
corresponding to the evolution of the network before and after the onset of physicality,
respectively. Up to the onset of physicality Mphys ∼N α, all link candidates are accepted,
hence the variance of l(t) is a constant equal to the variance of pLC(l); therefore
σ2
1 (Ltotal) ∼N α
(S59)
27

We showed in Eq. (S47) that near the jammed state LIS(t) ∼λ−4/5t1/5; therefore the
probability of accepting a link with length l becomes

The probability of accepting a link is positive only for short links in the large network
limit, and for small l the length distribution of link candidates is pLC(l) ∼l2 (Sec. S3.1.2).

in leading order. Together with Eq. (S59) this predicts that the variance of the total link
length at the jammed state scales as
σ2 (Ltotal) ∼N α ln N.
(S63)
To calculate the variance of the number of links in the jammed state σ2(Mmax), we intro-
duce a binary random variable b(t) for each time step, b(t) = 1 indicating that we successfully
added a link candidate and b(t) = 0 indicating that we rejected it. Similarly to the derivation
of σ2 (Ltotal), we can obtain σ2(Mmax) as the sum of the variances of b(t). Before the onset
of physicality, all link candidates are accepted; therefore the contribution of this stage of the
evolution of the network to σ2(Mmax) is zero. Approaching the jammed state, we can write
the sum of the variance of b(t) as

LINK LENGTH DISTRIBUTION IN THE JAMMED STATE
In this section we analytically characterize the length distribution of a randomly selected
link in jammed LPNs, we rely on the differential equations developed in Sec. S3. The link
length distribution p(l) is shaped by two factors: the length distribution of link candidates and
the probability that a link candidate gets accepted. The length distribution of link candidates
pLC(l) is given by the so-called cube line picking distribution which is the distribution of the
distance between two random points selected uniformly from the unit cube. The important
properties of pLC(l) for our derivation are: (i) that the support of pLC(l) is [0,
√
3], meaning
that the system size will induce an upper cutoff in p(l) and (ii) that for small l the effect of
boundaries becomes negligible and pLC(l) is equal to the surface of a sphere with radius l,
i.e., pLC(l) ≈4πl2.
Equation (S38) indicates that the probability of accepting a link of length l at time t
is the exponentially decaying function exp

−π
2λLIS(t)l

, where LIS(t) the total link length
increases over time, meaning that the length of links accepted decreases over time (see
Fig. 1e in the main text). Before the onset of physicality, even the longest links are accepted;
therefore the upper cutoff of p(l) is determined by pLC(l). On the other hand, very short
links l ≪(λLIS(t = N 2/2))−1 always get accepted, where LIS(t = N 2/2) ∼N

is the
total link length in the jammed state. This means that for small enough l ≪l∗∼N −2−α
5
the link length distribution is again determined by pLC(l) and we get
p(l) ∼l2.
(S66)
Note that l∗∼LIS/Mmax provides the scaling of the typical link length. To characterize p(l)
for intermediate l ∼l∗values, we write the link length distribution up to normalization as

DEGREE DISTRIBUTION AND CLUSTERING IN THE JAMMED STATE
Previously we showed that the length of the links in LPNs is reduced by volume exclusion.
Link length is a physical property of the system; volume exclusion, however, also affects
network properties, such as the degree distribution and the abundance of triangles. As we
build a LPN by sequentially adding links, some of the link candidates are discarded due to
physical conflicts. If we turn off physicality, however, all links are allowed and the process
generates an Erd˝os-R´enyi network (ER). Therefore, any difference in the properties of an
LPN and an ER network with the same number of nodes and links is a consequence of
physicality. To demonstrate the effect of physicality on network properties, we generate
jammed LPNs with only link-link interactions with fixed N as a function of λ together with
an ER counterpart with N nodes and Mmax links, and we compare their degree variances
and clustering coefficients.
S5.1.
Degree variance
Figure S11a shows the variance of the degree distribution of LPNs (σ2
LPN) and the corre-
sponding ER networks (σ2
ER) as a function of λ. For small λ physicality has no effect and the
jammed state is a fully connected network where each node has k = N −1 degree; therefore
for both the LPNs and ER networks σ2 tends to zero as λ →0. As λ increases, the node
degrees are no longer uniform and initially both σ2
LPN and σ2
ER increases. Also with increasing
λ, the jammed state becomes more sparse, i.e., Mmax(λ) decreases. The node degree in ER
networks follows a binomial distribution with mean ⟨k⟩ER = 2Mmax(λ)/N and variance
σ2
ER = N

1 −2Mmax(λ)
N 2
 2Mmax(λ)
N 2
,
(S71)
meaning that σ2
ER peaks when the jammed state contains half of all possible links. Figure S11a
shows that the degree variance σ2
LPN also peaks at intermediate λ values. However, σ2
LPN is
higher than σ2
ER for the entire range of λ, indicating that volume exclusion increases degree
heterogeneity in LPNs.
33

S5.2.
Clustering coefficient
The local clustering coefficient of node i is
Ci =
n△,i
ki(ki −1)/2,
(S72)
where n△,i is the number of triangles node i participates in and ki is degree of node i; Ci is
undefined for nodes with degree less than 2. Figure S11b shows the average local clustering
coefficient for both the LPNs (CLPN) and their ER counterpart (CER). For small λ, the
jammed state corresponds to the fully connected network, hence we have both CLPN = 1 and
CER = 1 for λ →0 and fixed N. As λ increases, Mmax(λ) decreases resulting in connected
wedges formed by two adjacent links that are not closed by a third link to form a triangle. For
ER networks, all node pairs are connected with the same probability p = 2Mmax(λ)/N(N−1);
therefore the probability of three nodes forming a triangle is p3 and three nodes forming a
connected triplet is p2, leading to
CER = p = 2Mmax(λ)
N(N −1).
(S73)
Therefore CER monotonically decreases as λ increases.
Figure S2 showed that as we increase the link thickness λ, the typical link length in the
jammed state decreases. Such shorter links imply that for high λ nodes tend to connect to
nodes in their physical vicinity increasing the chance of forming triangles. Indeed, Figure S11b
shows that for large λ the clustering coefficient CLPN increases compared to the random
expectation CER, confirming that volume exclusion increases the density of triangles in LPNs.
S5.3.
Stuck nodes for LPNs with only link-link interactions
In LPNs with node-link interactions, physical nodes and links cannot overlap by definition,
unless the link is adjacent to the node. During the generation of an LPN with only link-link
interactions, however, it might happen that a newly added link e = (v1, v2) overlaps with
isolated node v. If this happens, node v becomes stuck in the sense that as we add further
links to the network, node v may only be connected nodes v1 and v2, any other link would
generate a conflict with link e (Fig. S12).

Properties of the jammed network. (a) Variance of the degree distribution of

(b) Average local clustering coefficient of jammed networks compared to the randomized reference
networks (Crand = p). The data points represent an average of 50 independent networks, the error
bars, often smaller than the symbols, indicate the 95% confidence interval.
The presence of such nodes may alter the network properties of the LPN, for example,
it can contribute to the increased degree variance of the network. This raises the question:
how does the number of stuck nodes Ns depend on λ? To provide an upper bound for Ns in
the large network limit N →∞, we return to the analytical description of LPNs introduced
in Sec. S3. Equation (S48) predicts that the total link length in the jammed state scales as
Ltotal ∼N
4α+2
5 ,
(S74)
which in turn provides the scaling of the total volume of the links
Vtotal ∼λ2Ltotal ∼N −6α−2
5 ,
(S75)
The probability that a random node overlaps with any of the links is at most to Vtotal. This
is an upper bound, because a newly added link e = (v1, v2) can only overlap with node v if
v is not yet connected to any node other node than v1 and v2. Once v gains more than two
connections, link-link interactions make it impossible for node v to become stuck.
35

A consequence of the upper bound (S75) is that the probability of a node to become stuck
converges to zero in the large network limit for any α > 1/3, suggesting that the effect of
stuck nodes becomes irrelevant for most network properties. Note, however, that the number
of stuck nodes Ns ≲N · Vtotal may diverge for 1/3 < α < 1/2, although sub-linearly.

FIG. S12. Stuck nodes in LPNs with only link-link interactions. (a) During the generation
of an LPN, consider a physical node v that is still isolated. (b) Since node-link interaction is
not taken into account a newly added link (v1, v2) may overlap with node v. As we continue the
generation of the LPN, any link that connects v to nodes other than v1 or v2 would generate a
physical conflict; and therefore is forbidden. We call such nodes stuck. (c) However, node v may
still be able to connect to nodes v1 and v2, since overlap is allowed between links that share an
endpoint. Therefore stuck nodes have degree at most two.

SPECTRA OF LINEAR PHYSICAL NETWORKS
In this section, we examine the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the adjacency matrix of
LPNs. Volume exclusion determines which links can and cannot be added to physical net-
works, hence it induces a correlation between the physical layout and the abstract network
structure of LPNs. In the following, we use numerical simulations and analytical consider-
ations to show the emergence of eigenvectors of the adjacency matrix that only depend on
the position of physical nodes, which connects the abstract network structure captured by
the adjacency matrix to the physical structure captured by the node positions.
S6.1.
Eigenspectrum of Erd˝os-R´enyi networks
If volume exclusion has no effect on network evolution, e.g., M < Mphys, all link condidates
are accepted and the resulting network is equivalent to an Erd˝os-R´enyi (ER) network. Any
difference observed between the eigenspectrum of a LPN and an ER network of the same
size is an affect of volume exclusion.
The distribution of the eigenvalues µ of an ER network in the large network limit with
diverging average degree (i.e., ⟨k⟩→∞as N →∞) is given by Wigner’s semicircle law [21].

N, where p is the probability that two nodes are connected in the ER
network. The largest eigenvalue µ1 separated from the bulk and corresponds to the average
degree:
µ1 = (N −2)p + 1 + O(N −1/2).
(S77)
S6.2.
Simulations
We generate LPNs with N = 500 nodes and varying link width λ, and we calculate the
eigenvalues of their adjacency matrix at different points M ≤Mmax of the network evolution.
Figure S13 compares the spectra of LPNs with only link-link interactions to ER networks
37

with the same number of nodes and links. We observe that at the onset of physicality
(M = Mphys) the eigenspectrum of an LPN is consistent with spectrum of its ER network
counterpart, which in turn for a dense enough network is well approximated by Wigner’s
semicircle law Eq. (S76) (Fig. S13a,d,g,j). In the jammed state (M = Mmax), LPNs differ
for the ER networks in two main ways: (i) the bulk of the eigenvalue distribution becomes
right skewed, and (ii) a group of three eigenvalues µ2, µ3 and µ4 become separated from the
bulk (Fig. S13c,f,i,l). We observe two deviations from this general picture: (i) For large λ,
LPNs reach the jammed state while remaining sparse. For such networks, the skewness of the
eigenspectrum is prominently observable in the numerical simulations and the separation of
the three leading eigenvalues from the bulk is less clear (Fig. S13c). (ii) For some values of
N and λ, we observe that in addition to µ2, µ3 and µ4 further groups of eigenvalues separate
from the bulk. We examine these two deviations in more detail in Secs. S6.2.1 and S6.2.2.
The eigenvectors v(2), v(3) and v(4) corresponding to µ2, µ3 and µ4, respectively, capture
the large-scale physical structure of the network and are largely independent of the details
of the wiring of the network. In other words, the value of the eigenvector at node i is largely
determined by the position of node i and does not depend on exactly which nodes i is
connected to, i.e., v(j)
i
≈v(ri) for j = 2, 3, 4. To show this we first select the eigenvector
v out of the group of v(2),v(3) and v(4) which correlates the most with the x coordinate of
the nodes. We then plot vi as a function of xi which shows a clear correlation between the
eigenvector and the node position (Fig. S14).

density of an LPN is consistent with the spectral density of ER networks with the same number of
nodes and links, indicating that physicality has no effect on the evolution of the abstract network
for M < Mphys. (c,f,i,l) In the jammed state the spectrum of an LPN differs from the spectrum
of its ER counterpart in two main ways: (i) the bulk of the distribution becomes right skewed,
and (ii) a group of three eigenvalues (µ2, µ3 and µ4) separate from the bulk. These differences
are a consequence of physicality. (c) For λ values where the jammed state corresponds to a sparse
abstract network, the separation of the three eigenvalues from the bulk is less pronounced. (f) For
certain λ values, we observe that additional groups of eigenvalues separate from the bulk. Each
subplot show the spectral density of a single LPN with N = 500 nodes. The orange outline is the
spectral density of an ER network with the same number of nodes and links as the corresponding

Eigenvectors of LPNs. In the jammed state the eigenvectors v(2), v(3) and v(4)

demonstrate this we pick the eigenvector v that correlates the most with the x coordinate of the
nodes and plot vi, the value of the eigenvector at node i, as a function of xi, the position of node i.
The gray markers correspond to the individual nodes of the networks, the solid line shows a moving
average of 15 nodes. The dashed line shows the theoretical prediction. The subplots correspond to
the networks in Fig. S13, we use matching colors. (a) Figure S13c showed that µ2, µ3 and µ4 do not
separate clearly from the bulk for parameters N = 500 and λ = 4.47 · 10−2. We observe, however,
that the corresponding eigenvectors still correlate with the node position, despite apparent lack
of separation. For LPNs with only link-link interactions with high λ, we observe stuck nodes, i.e.,
isolated nodes that overlap with links due to the lack of node-link volume exclusion. The value of
the eigenvector v is zero at nodes that remain isolated in the jammed state, hence the increased
number of nodes with vi = 0.
40

S6.2.1.
Groups of separated eigenvalues in the jammed state
Figure S13f shows the eigenvalue distribution of an LPN with N = 500 and λ = N −1 =
2·10−2, indicating that the group of three eigenvalues that separate from the bulk is followed
by an additional group eigenvalues that also separate. To better understand this behavior,
we generate a larger LPN with N = 2000 and λ = N −1 and calculate the spectrum of
its adjacency matrix. Figure S15a indicates that for these parameter values there are three
separated groups of eigenvalues: the initial group containing three eigenvalues, followed by
a group of six and a group of ten eigenvalues. On Figs. S15b-d, we plot an eigenvector
from each group that has the highest dependence on the x node coordinate. We find that
eigenvector in the first group is monotonic function of x (Fig. S15b), while the eigenvector
from the second group has a maximum at x = 1/2 (Fig. S15c) and the eigenvector in the
third group has a maximum at x = 1/3 and x = 2/3 (Fig. S15d). This indicates that the
second and third group of eigenvalues also capture physical structure, and we observe that
these eigenvectors are well-approximated by sinusoidal functions.

Separation of µ2, µ3 and µ4
In the jammed state of an LPN, the top three eigenvalues following the largest sep-
arate from the bulk (Fig. S13) and the corresponding eigenvectors capture the physical
structure of the LPN (Fig. S14). We observed, however, for parameters N = 500 and
λ = N −1/2 = 4.47 · 10−2 that the separation is less clear (Fig. S13c); yet, similarly to
the case where the separation is pronounced, the corresponding eigenvectors capture physi-
cal layout of the network. To better understand this behavior, we calculated the spectra of
LPNs with increasing size N while setting λ = N −1/2, i.e., choosing parameter α = 1/2. Note
that according to Eq. (S50), with increasing network size the average degree of the abstract
network in the jammed state increases, albeit slowly, as ⟨k⟩∼N
3α−1
5
= N 0.1. We find that
the spectra of LPNs for N = 500, 1000, 2000 and 4000 are similar and that the numerical
results do not decisively determine whether the three leading eigenvalues become bounded
from the bulk in the large network limit N →∞or not. The lack of numerical evidence is
likely explained by the slow divergence of the average degree in the jammed state.
Figure S17 shows the eigenvector that correlates the most with the x node coordinate for
each N. We find for all network sizes that the eigenvectors v(2), v(3) and v(4) capture the
physical layout of the network. However, the role of stuck nodes becomes more pronounced
with increasing N.

FIG. S16. Separation of eigenvalues for large λ. The spectral density of LPNs with only link-
link interactions and with increasing size while setting λ = N−1/2, which corresponds to setting the
exponent α = 1/2. The numerical simulations do not provide decisive evidence whether the group
of µ2, µ3 and µ4 eigenvalues become bounded from the bulk in the N →∞limit or not. Networks
with α ≤1/2 contain a diverging number, but zero fraction, of stuck nodes (Sec. S5.3). Stuck nodes
have maximum degree 2, resulting in the sharp peak around µ = 0; to increase legibility, we only
show the spectral density upto 0.25. The subplots show the spectral density of a single LPN and
the insets show the rank-plot of the first 10 eigenvalues. The orange outline is the spectral density
of an ER network with the same number of nodes and links as the corresponding LPN, and the

S6.3.
Theory
Let µi be the ith eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix and v(i) the corresponding eigenvector
such that µ1 ≥µ2 ≥. . . ≥µN. Numerical simulations indicate that the eigenvectors v(2), v(3)
and v(4) correspond to the spatial locations of the nodes in the jammed state of the physical
network (Sec. S6.2). In this section, we show that these eigenvectors are given by the first few
Fourier basis and the corresponding eigenvalues are equal to the Fourier coefficients of P(l),
the probability that two nodes at distance l are connected. We rely on an approximation
similar to the high density approximation of the Euclidean random matrix theory [8, 13].
We start by searching for eigenvectors v that only depend on the position of the nodes,
i.e., vi = v(r(i)), where vi is the value of the eigenvector v at node i and r(i) is the location
of node i. The characteristic equation determining µ and v is
µv(r(i)) =
N
X
j=1
Aijv(r(j)),
(S78)
we aim to approximate this equation such that it does not depend on the details of A, only
on its average behavior.
As a first step, we show that in the jammed state physical nodes are densely connected
to other nodes in their spatial neighborhood. The characteristic link length in the jammed
state is
l∗∼Ltot
Mmax
∼N −2−α
5 ,
(S79)
meaning that for α < 2 the characteristic scale l∗tends to zero in the large network limit.
The typical number of other nodes a node i can potentially connect to is proportional to the
number of nodes in a ball with radius l∗centered around i
N ∗∼N · N −3 2−α
5
= N
3α−1
5 ,
(S80)
which diverges as N →∞for α > 1/3. The typical degree of a node also scales as
⟨k⟩= 2Mmax
N
∼N
3α−1
5 ,
(S81)
meaning that indeed nodes are densely connected within their neighborhood, i.e., they con-
nect to finite fraction of the nodes within the characteristic length l∗. In other words, for
46

1/3 < α < 2 in the large network limit, l∗goes to zero, yet N ∗diverges, and nodes are
densely connected with other nodes within their neighborhood.
This observation allows us to substitute the adjacency matrix A with its expectation in
the characteristic equation (S78), leading to
µv(r(i)) ≈
N
X
j=1
P(
r(i) −r(j))v(r(j)),
(S82)
where P(l) the probability that two nodes at distance l are connected. Assuming that the
eigenvector v(r) changes much slower than the typical distance between neighboring nodes
N −1/3 and the probability that two nodes connect only depends on their relative position (i.e.,
boundary effects are negligible) allows us to substitute the summation with an integration:
µv(r) ≈N
Z
[0,1]3 d3sP(|s −r|)v(s),
(S83)
where the integration runs over the unit cube. Since the characteristic link length l∗tends
to zero, we can expand the limits of integration to infinity wiht out introducing an error in
the N →∞limit:
µv(r) ≈N
Z ∞
−∞
d3sP(|s −r|)v(s),
(S84)
To continue, we search for eigenvectors of the form
v(r) ∼e−ikr,
(S85)
where k ∈R3 is a wavevector. Substituting into Eq. (S84) we get
µe−ikr ≈N
Z ∞
−∞
d3sP(|s −r|)e−iks.
(S86)
Multiplying both sides with eikr leads to
µ ≈N
Z ∞
−∞
d3wP(|w|)e−ikw,
(S87)
where we introduced the new integration variable w = s −r. Equation (S87) indicates that
under the assumptions we made, v(r) = e−ikr is indeed an eigenvector of the adjacency
matrix with eigenvalue provided by Eq. (S87).
47

For numerical simulations, we observed that in the jammed state a group of three eigen-
values are separated from the bulk of the spectral density and the corresponding eigenvectors
correlate with the position of the nodes.
Theory predicts the emergence of a group of three eigenvectors with the same eigenvalue
corresponding to wavevectors k = π(1, 0, 0), π(0, 1, 0) and π(0, 0, 1), consistent with simu-
lations (Fig. S14). Theory further predicts a group of six eigenvectors corresponding to all
possible combinations of second order sinusoidal functions and a group of ten eigenvectors
corresponding to all possible combinations of third order sinusoidal functions. Indeed, we
find for sufficiently large LPNs (e.g., for N = 2000 and λ = N −1) such separated eigenvalue
groups can emerge (S15).
S6.4.
Predicting node position
In the jammed state, the eigenvectors v2, v3 and v4 of an LPN are largely determined
by its physical layout. This allows us to predict the node positions relying on the structure
of the abstract network only, i.e., relying on the adjacency matrix. Theory and symmetry
considerations predict that all three eigenvectors have the same eigenvalue, i.e., µ2 = µ3 = µ4,
hence any linear combination of v2, v3 and v4 is also an eigenvector. This means that we
cannot in general assign an eigenvector to each of the axis of the unit cube to predict the
position of nodes. (Although in numerical simulations we find that the eigenvectors tend to
be close to parallel with the axes due to inhomogeneities of the cube.) Therefore, to quantify
the predictive power of the eigenvectors, we first find a linear transformation that best aligns
the eigenvectors v(2), v(3) and v(4) with the node coordinates. Specifically, we find matrix
a ∈R3×3 and vector b ∈R3 that minimizes
C =
N
X
i=1
aw(i) + b −r(i)2 ,
(S88)
where w(i) = [v(2)
i , v(3)
i , v(4)
i ] is a three dimensional vector with elements corresponding to
the value of the eigenvectors at node i, and r(i) is the position of node i. Then, we calculate
the coefficient of determination R2, where R2 = 1 indicates perfect alignment, and R2 = 0
corresponds to guessing the center of the unit cube as the position of each node.

REAL PHYSICAL NETWORKS AND THE GENERALIZED META-GRAPH
Real physical networks are typically not linear, meaning that they are not solely composed
of spheres and straight rods. If we add a new non-straight physical link to a network, we can
route it infinitely many ways; therefore it is not possible to keep track of emerging physical
conflicts relying on the original definition of the meta-graph. Despite this limitation, we
show that it is possible to define a generalized version of the meta-graph that is useful to
characterize the physical structure of any existing physical network.
S7.1.
Skeletonized representation of physical networks
Most real physical networks, from neural or vascular networks to rock fissures, are obtained
as volumetric data from experiments. Volumetric representation of a physical network means
that the three-dimensional space is divided into voxels, the three-dimensional equivalent of
pixels, and the voxels are labeled to be inside or outside the physical network. While such
representation provides the most accurate description of the shape of a physical network
that is available, it is both computational and analytically demanding to analyze. Therefore
volumetric data is routinely approximated by skeletonization, capturing less details, but
providing a more concise description.
The skeleton of a physical network is in fact a variant of a linear physical network: a
skeletonization algorithm approximates the shape of a physical network with vertices and
straight segments inside the physical network and associates a radius to each vertex. Multiple
segments in the skeleton can correspond to what is considered a separate entity in the original
network, e.g., a single neuron in a neural network or a non-branching section of a vessel in
the vascular network is represented by a collection of straight segments in the skeleton.
Therefore it is common to associate a label with each segment connecting it the original
object it represents. Altogether, a skeleton representation for our purposes must have the
following properties
Definition S7.1. A skeleton representation S is a graph with vertex set V and edge set E
together with
49

• a position r : V →R3 and a radius ρ : V →R+ associated to each vertex,
• and a label σ : E →Z associated to each edge.
Note that the skeleton S is a physical realization of the abstract network G, where the
node set of G is the set of labels in S.
To recover an approximate volume of a physical network from a skeleton, we take the
union of spheres centered at r(v) with radius ρ(v) for each vertex v ∈V, and truncated
cones that have axis corresponding to the segment (r(v), r(w)) and parallel faces with radii
ρ(v) and ρ(w) for each edge (v, w) ∈E. Alternatively, a less accurate but simpler approximate
volume can be obtained by substituting each edge by a cylinder with axis (r(v), r(w)) and
radius (ρ(v) + ρ(w))/2.
The quality of the approximation can be controlled by the number of vertices in the skele-
ton. There is, however, no single definition of the cost function that characterizes how good
an approximation is, and there are a large number of skeletonization algorithms available and
used in various scientific disciplines [16]. We obtained the data that we work with already
in a skeleton representation, unless otherwise noted.
S7.2.
The generalized meta-graph
The goal of the generalized meta-graph is to characterize a given physical network by
identify components that are in a physically confined space. We define the generalized meta-
graph Mg for a skeleton representation of a physical network.
Definition S7.2. Given a skeleton representation S and a parameter ∆λ, the associated
generalized meta-graph Mg(∆λ, S) is a graph with vertex set corresponding to the edge
labels of S. We increase the radius of each skeleton-vertex by ∆λ, and meta-vertices l1 and
l2 are connected if the approximate volume corresponding to the labels l1 and l2 now overlap.
The labels li of a skeleton representation S correspond to separate nodes or links of
a physical network, for example, a label can identify the skeleton of a single neuron in a
neural network or a vessel segment in a vascular network. The degree of a neuron or vessel in
50

Mg(λ, S) quantifies its physical confinement: it counts the neurons or vessels that surround it
in space. A skeleton S is a physical realization of an abstract network G, such as the synaptic
network for neurons or the network of vessel segments connected together by junction points.
There are, however, many alternative skeletons S′ that realize the same abstract network,
prompting the question: What are the properties of S that are common in all realizations
and what are differences? Two neurons that are connected in the synaptic network or two
vessels bound together at a junction point are necessarily adjacent in physical space, hence
they become connected in the generalized meta-graph for low ∆λ for any possible physical
layout S′ realizing the abstract network. To measure the excess confinement of a neuron,
i.e., the confinement beyond what is necessitated by the synaptic network, we define the
restricted meta-graph, where we exclude all edges in the generalized meta-graph that are
between neurons that are synaptic partners or vessel segments bound together.
Definition S7.3. Given a generalized meta-graph Mg(∆λ, S) and a corresponding abstract
network G, the restricted meta-graph Mr(∆λ, S) is obtained by removing each edge e =
(l1, l2) from Mg(∆λ, S) if l1 and l2 are adjacent in G.
Figure S18 shows an example comparing the generalized and the restricted meta-graph.
Note that the original meta-graph M(λ, P) is a special case of the restricted meta-graph.
We start from a skeleton S corresponding to a complete graph on P with uniform link
thickness 0, and labeling each link uniquely. The restricted meta-graph Mr(λ, S) obtained
by thickening each link by λ is equivalent to the original meta-graph M(λ, P).

Data sets
S7.3.1.
Fruit fly brain
Relying on automated imaging techniques, a recent project mapped out a large fraction
of the brain of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster containing the three-dimensional map of
approximately 25,000 neurons and the location 20 million synapses [17]. We downloaded the
skeletonized data describing the shape of each neuron through the publicly available NeuPrint
API [3]. To reduce the computational complexity, we focus on analyzing the Medula brain
region (labeled ME(R), Fig. S19a) [10], which contains 2,979 neurons and 1,464,000 segments,
making it a computationally difficult task to identify collisions between neurons exactly. To
overcome this difficulty, we substitute each neuron skeleton by a point cloud and use an
efficient k-d tree implementation to query minimum distances between them.
In the skeletonized data set, each segment is labeled by the neuron that it belongs to,
hence the meta-vertices represent neurons. The skeleton together with the location of the
synapse is a physical realization of the synaptic network.
S7.3.2.
Vascular network
The vascular network data set describes the vasculature found in a 600 × 600 × 662 µm
sample of a mouse cortex (Fig. S19b) [7]. The data is provided as a skeleton including radii
at the skeleton vertices. We uniquely label non-branching vessel sections, i.e., each path
connecting a pair of skeleton vertices with degree k ̸= 2 receives a unique identifier. The
skeleton is a physical realization of an abstract network, where nodes are vessel segments,
and two nodes are connected if the corresponding vessels are bound together at a junction
point. We construct the generalized meta-graph such that the meta-vertices represent the
labeled vessel segments.
53

S7.3.3.
Mitochondrial network
The mitochondrial network data represents the mitochondrial reticulum of yeast cells
(Fig. S19c) [22]. The data set is available both as a skeleton and as a mesh representing the
surface. There is no radii provided with skeleton vertices; therefore we extracted a radius
for each skeleton vertex based on the surface mesh using the skeletor python package [18].
Similarly to the vascular network, we uniquely label non-branching sections of the skeleton,
and we construct the generalized meta-graph such that the meta-vertices represent these
labeled sections.
S7.3.4.
Root system
The root network describes the root system of a Cryptomeria japonica tree (Fig. S19d) [14].
The data is provided as a skeleton including radii at the skeleton vertices. We uniquely label
non-branching root sections, i.e., each path connecting a pair of skeleton vertices with degree
k ̸= 2 receives a unique identifier. We construct the generalized meta-graph such that the
meta-vertices represent these labeled sections.
54

S7.4.
The restricted meta-graph of real networks
We calculate the restricted meta-graph for the four real physical networks as a function
of ∆λ, where we measure ∆λ in units of the average radius of the original network. As a
reference, we also generate a jammed random linear physical network with N = 300 nodes
and λ = N −1/2 and calculate its restricted meta-graph by thickening the links present in
the jammed state. Figure S19f shows the average meta-degree ⟨kmeta⟩as a function of ∆λ
for each network, revealing two distinct patterns: for the brain network we observe an initial
fast increase in the average meta-degree followed by a slower, steady growth. Such rapid
growth is absent in the vascular, mitochondrial and root system networks, and is also absent
in random linear networks.
This different behavior represents the differences in the building blocks: the connectome
consists of highly intertwined neurons with complex shapes, while the other three networks
consist of tube-like components, such as vessels, molecular chains and roots. Indeed, if we
subdivide each neuron into smaller non-branching segments before constructing the meta-
graph, we recover the superlinear behavior without the initial rapid growth of of ⟨kmeta⟩
(Fig. S19e).

vertices with degree not equal to two (color coded sections). In the generalized and restricted meta-
graph the vertices represent these non-branching sections. (f) Average degree of the restricted
meta-graph ⟨kmeta⟩as the thickness of network is increased by ∆λ, where ∆λ is measured in units
equal to the average radius of the original physical network. Dots represent real physical networks
and the dashed line represents a linear physical network with N = 300 nodes and λ = N−1/2. To
show that the complex shape of the neurons is responsible for the shape of ⟨kmeta⟩(∆λ) we divide
the neurons into smaller non-branching sections and we calculate ⟨kmeta⟩treating these sections as
the vertices of the restricted meta-graph.
56

S7.5.
The generalized and the restricted meta-graph of the fruit fly brain network
Neurons can only form synapses if their axons and dendrites are in close physical prox-
imity; therefore, if we increase the diameter of neuron branches, neurons will quickly overlap
with synaptic partners (Fig. S20).
In the generalized meta-graph Mg(λ) of the fruit fly brain network, vertices represent
neurons and edges indicate conflicts between pairs of neurons – both between pairs that are
connected via synapses and pairs that are not. Since synaptic partners necessarily overlap,
we expect a positive correlation between the number of synapses a neuron has and the
generalized meta-degree of the neuron, this expectation is indeed confirmed by numerical
measurements (Fig. S21).
On the other hand, edges of the restricted meta-graph Mr(λ) represent physical conflicts
only between neuron pairs that are not connected by synapses. In other words, Mr(λ) focuses
on conflicts that are not necessitated by the synaptic network. Figure S22 shows that we
again find a positive correlation between the number of synapses and the restricted meta-
degree of a neuron, indicating that neurons central in the synaptic network are also tightly
confined by other neurons. This is non-obvious, as we can construct physical networks that
have a negative correlation between the number of synapses and the restricted meta-degree
(Fig. S23).

We show the meta-degree (i.e., the number of conflicts) of the neuron highlighted in Fig. 4 of the
main text with non-synaptic (blue) and synaptic (orange) partners as a function of ∆λ. Initially,
for ∆λ = 0 the neuron has no conflicts. After increasing the thickness of the neural branches all
312 synaptic partners become quickly in conflict with the neuron. The number of conflicts with
non-synaptic partners outnumbers the conflicts with synaptic partners, for example, at ∆λ ≈3.34
the neuron has 312 conflicts with synaptic partners and 574 conflicts with non-synaptic partners.

degrees. (b) Logs of the same color are bound together, meaning that each physical
node is a cross. (c) In this construction, each physical node touches every other node;
therefore, the corresponding generalized meta-graph is fully connected, each node has
generalized meta-degree 4. Since all physical nodes are adjacent in space, this physical
layout can realize any abstract network. For example, if nodes represent neurons, the
physical layout can support any synaptic network. If neuron i in the synaptic network
is connected to ki other neurons, its restricted meta-degree is N −ki, meaning that
there is a perfect negative correlation between the degree in the synaptic network and
the restricted meta-degree.

S7.6.
LPNs as null models for real physical networks
Random LPNs may serve as null models for analyzing real physical networks, similarly
to the role of the Erd˝os-R´enyi model and the configuration model in analyzing abstract
networks. To demonstrate this application, we constructed a null model for the vascluar
network data set by the following steps:
• We identified the location of branching points in the vascular network.
• We constructed an abstract network where nodes represent branching points and the
branching points are connected if they are connected by a vessel in the physical network.
• To construct the null model, we generated a random LPN with the same number of
nodes and links, by keeping the coordinates of the branching points and the diameter
lambda to match the average diameter in the original network.
Figure S24 compares a physical property (total link length Ltotal) and an abstract network
property (clustering coefficient C) of the original network to the null model. We found that
Ltotal is much longer in the corresponding LPN than in the vascular network, hence volume
exclusion is not sufficient to create the locality observed in the real data. This could be
explained by the fact that in a tissue vessels need to fight for empty space not only with the
other blood vessels, but also with other structural elements. Surprisingly, we also found that
triangles are exceedingly rare in the real vascular network, even compared to random LPNs.
