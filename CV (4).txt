Spoken Language Systems Group, MIT CSAIL Lab
Cambridge, MA
Researcher Intern
2012–2013
• Designed web interfaces on Amazon Mechanical Turk to collect spoken sentences and their semantic labeling.
• Trained sequence tagging models by implementing features for conditional random fields, resulting in English
and Chinese models for categorizing words in speech queries.
• Deployed the models in speech-enabled mobile applications for movie, flight, and restaurant recommendations.

Engineering Intern
2011
• Wrote scripts to periodically analyze the usage pattern of Dropbox users. Investigated methods to optimize data
calculation and caching for the analytics team.
• Implemented bug filtering and email notification system in the error log viewer, making critical errors get
noticed and fixed faster.
Reflective Commonsense Thinking, MIT Media Lab
Cambridge, MA
Researcher Intern
2010
• Implemented algorithms to solve error-correcting subgraph isomorphism and analogical matching problems.
• Applied the algorithms on analogy problems, enabling the system to make decisions based on past experiences.
